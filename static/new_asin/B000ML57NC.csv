8169692,5,B000ML57NC,"Released in 1987 during the glasnost years just before the 1989 dissolution of the Soviet empire, this film depicts students as they come of age in the Soviet system in the late 1930s.  Their families and teachers also attempt to navigate the restrictions and suspicions that prevailed in those years.  This film is perhaps more important as an indicator of growing openness in portraying the past than it is as high drama and great acting, but the young actors are very believable.  Being a student of Soviet and Russian history,I give it five stars for treatment of the historical context as well as cinematic quality.",1371081600,,620,4.885714285714286
8169693,5,B000ML57NC,"It's agreat movie for those interested in what the life was like in Soviet Union during the rise of Stalin's empire. The best thing is that the strory is shown as it's seen and experienced by teenages who were born and grew up with unconditional worship for thier Soviet government and had to re-adjust their values and attitudes during the course of the movie.
Also, the shipment went out the next day I ordered it and was delivered even earlier than expected. Great service!",1369526400,,476,4.678571428571429
