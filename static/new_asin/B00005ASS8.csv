The Lady's Man (original airdate Jan. 8, 1958). When Little Luke spies a stranger (John Stephenson) on the property aiming a strange looking gun, Grandpa, Luke and Pepino go after him. They quickly discover the intruder is a photographer for Panorama Magazine and his gun is a camera with a telephoto lens. He's doing a spread on California ranches and wants the McCoys as subjects. When the stranger moves in with the family for a couple of days he turns out to be a perfect gentleman, much to Kate's delight and Luke's dismay. Will Kate fall for his Hollywood charm? Will Luke fight to keep her down on the farm?

Two's Company (original airdate April 23, 1959). Luke's got a problem. With Grandpa's friends away, he's spending all his time with Luke, and Kate is feeling neglected. Luke promises to have a talk with Grandpa but he can't quite get up the nerve -- Grandpa depends on the company and, according to him, there's no room for a woman in business discussions or a game of checkers. Things come to a head when Kate and Luke stop talking altogether and Grandpa blames Kate. But Pepino spills the beans. Now it's up to Grandpa to mend fences in his own cantankerous way.",1125619200,,1216,4.625
