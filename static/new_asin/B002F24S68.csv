3920687,3,B002F24S68,"If you are a fan of Jason Aldean, you will enjoy this video.  It is not a real high quality production, but it is good for a performer like Jason who is not yet a huge star.  I think it is a good view of what a Jason Aldean concert is like and it shows he has a LOT of talent.",1269302400,,276,3.5081967213114753

3920689,5,B002F24S68,"This concert is very well put together. The audio is great, the picture is amazing and the concert itself is full of energy. The drummer cracks me up with all his faces he makes. Great everything. You will not be disappointed.",1262131200,,226,4.536585365853658

3920691,5,B002F24S68,The product was exactly as described and just what I was looking for. Delivery was timely and overall a good transaction.,1256169600,,121,4.809523809523809
3920692,5,B002F24S68,"Since seeing Jason Aldean live in Dallas, Texas this summer I have wanted to see him sing again live and this DVD simply delivers that desire to one's doorstep! I've really enjoyed it as you have front row seats and can pay closer attention to the specifics that contribute to Jason's success. Jason Aldean and his WONDERFUL band have recently skyrocketed to the top of the billboards and this DVD will give you a good idea why.  It is a quality DVD, produced well and of course it is full of all of his hits, plus more. I HIGHLY recommend it to all.  I'll promise you that you won't be disappointed!",1253145600,2,600,4.396396396396397

3920694,5,B002F24S68,"First off, the sound on the 5.1 is amazing! One of the best sounding live dvd's I've ever heard. The concert is top notch stuff, great setlist, great performance. This is the type of dvd that is capable of winning over new fans, not just for the existing fan base. As Jason mentions in the behind the scenes footage, this is to show what he's about. This is as strong a live dvd as there is in the country market. If you're a fan, it's a must have, if you're curious, check it out, it's impressive!",1252368000,2,498,4.197916666666667

3920701,2,B002F24S68,"Product showed up at a decent time, however the whole disc cut in and out with the music not matching the actions or mouth of the words. Almost like it was cheaply recorded. The disc didn't have ANY scratches or marks, and just to be sure I used BOTH my Blu-ray players, and it did the same thing in both. I returned the item just fine,  but NOT right I had to pay to return it so I LOST money for a shotty product.",1413417600,,415,3.9404761904761907

3920704,2,B002F24S68,"yea, i have been getting alot of dvd concerts. and this one didn't impress me much. I guess i was expecting a better a better stage show with alittle more action. I don't think I'll even turn it on to my friends. they might get bored. Sorry : (",1360540800,,244,4.0
3920705,5,B002F24S68,Great dvd! Couldn't afford tickets to see him this year so I bought this and the night of the concert my boyfriend and I watched it.  Great show!,1355270400,,145,4.178571428571429

3920707,5,B002F24S68,One of the best country artists out there. Concert is outstanding ans sounds great. Hopefully he puts another one out soon. Doesn't get any better than this.,1352851200,,157,4.851851851851852

3920709,4,B002F24S68,"Good show; I really like Jason's band, and this was a good way to see them play since they don't get enough exposure on his individual song vids. I was a little disappointed with Rich Redmond's drum solo, however--he's such a flamboyant drummer that I expected more flair in a solo. He's still spot-on, though.
ENJOY!",1330732800,,317,4.678571428571429
3920710,1,B002F24S68,I really cannot review this item because it will not play in any CD player.  I am so disappointed.  Love Jason Aldean.  This is a bad CD.,1308182400,,137,4.0

3920712,5,B002F24S68,"New Aldean fan (caught him on Crossroads with Bryan Adams by accident) and somewhat impressed. Got this blu-ray under $8 and man, this is one of the better blu-ray concerts I own (the best being the Celine Dion one). Eagle Rock has really produced a great concert disc here. All channels are finally used (including center channel) and for 1080i, the video is amazing!! Most of Eagle's rock concerts I own on blu-ray are ok at best...not impressive at all. But man, someone tweaked up the quality control for this one! Lets release more country concerts on blu-ray like this one and not a bunch of old rock and roll bands that should retire! This guy is refreshing and this concert made me a Jason Aldean fan. Gettin all his CDs now.
Just glad I took the risk after sooooo many disappointing blu-ray discs from Eagle Rock and I am VERY impressed!
Great job guys! Bring on some other new acts for us music fans!!",1294358400,,911,4.527272727272727
3920713,5,B002F24S68,This is a great concert dvd by Jason Aldean. He's the best country singer to come along in a long time. A+,1290816000,,106,3.8636363636363638
3920714,5,B002F24S68,I am sure glad I found this guy. Love his music but I prefer the audio on his recordings rather than the Live Concert. This will give the fans a new insight into Jason and the band. If your a fan then this is for you....next best thing to being there live. I bought this DVD first and then I bought the albums. Probably should have done it the other way around. I am sure glad I have the albums because I like so many of the songs that were not performed live.,1284249600,,460,3.956989247311828
3920715,5,B002F24S68,"This dvd will always manage to find it's way back into the player, because Jason and his band are having so much fun on stage that you will wish that you were there watching them perform live. Jason Aldean's Wide Open Live and More is just that, it is wide open and it will leave you wanting More. This dvd would be a must have for any country music fan's collection, and it would not be out of place with your Rock collection either. Great Stuff, Keep up the good work Jason.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-Aldean-Wide-Open-Live-and-More/dp/B002F24S68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason Aldean: Wide Open Live and More</a>",1283212800,4,665,5.594059405940594
