8162392,1,B000LNP54W,"My husband and I were both very disappointed in the flow and quality of of this Canadian RDA produced Normandy DVD.  My husband asked me if I actually had to pay for it. We are about to travel back to Normandy for our 3rd visit with a couple who have not been there and I hoped this DVD would remind us of good travels, give us new ideas of other places to visit and show an over view to our friends. The video hops from place to place without telling you where you are many times and has no flow as to seeing Normandy from east to west or any other travel pattern. It is in 3 sections which are difficult to manuever and the 3rd segment is all on Reims, which is east of Paris and while a lovely place, it has little to do with Normandy. I feel cheated and feel that our home movies could be produced in better quality. I looked at the return guarantee but it says to return in the unopened original wrapping and if we hadn't unwrapped it we would never know how mediocre is is. Save your money!",1237507200,,996,4.081632653061225

I bought this DVD in anticipation of visiting Normandy and thought the DVD would be helpful. The DVD shows highlights of Normandy, but I found Rick Steve's DVD on Normandy to be more comprehensive and informative.",1200182400,,346,7.675
