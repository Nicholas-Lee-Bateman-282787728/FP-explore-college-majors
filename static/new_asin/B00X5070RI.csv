8715014,4,B00X5070RI,"A perfectly good b+ grade romcom/drama starring likeable people, even though some are pretty rough.  The romantic leads are very good with good chemistry.  The plot is a little bit forced, but I thought it was pretty original.  Too bad it's not in a U.S. format.  It was filmed in the USA, so what's with the Australian connection.  I saw it on The Movie Channel Extra on dish t.v. and this is the first time I got a response on Amazon at all.  I hope they will find the U.S. appropriate version and make it available.",1434585600,2,518,4.34375
