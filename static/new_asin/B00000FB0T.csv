8215898,1,B00000FB0T,"Poor old Alf says he kept quiet about his Beatles involvement from 1966 to 1989. It's a pity he didn't leave it that way.
This video is so poorly directed and edited that it is not clear whether you are in Liverpool, London or USA at any given time.
Alf MUST have had some interesting memories from three years with The Fabs, but they're not recorded here ... John pinched a bottle of milk, there was a large crowd at Shea Stadium etc.
At least half the footage is filled with Alf plodding along a street somewhere, plus many clips from Paul's world tour. (Relevance? Alf went to one concert and Paul spoke to him...)
Most of the anecdotes are rehashed (George Harrison didn't like George Martin's tie) and there is little here to interest even a serious Beatles fan.
Spend your money elsewhere!",1056153600,,795,4.527777777777778
