8046763,1,B0007CILQQ,"If they handed out free passes for this movie, I would choose to do laundry instead.  Seriously.  Right now it is playing on the T.V. in the other room, and I came into the computer room to type a review in order to spare others the pain of the poor quality of acting.  The actors speak in a monotone, the thin plot is predictable, and there is no depth to the film.  An elementary drama club could put on a better performance than this trite piece of work.",1387324800,,457,4.159090909090909
8046764,3,B0007CILQQ,"This an okay running movie. There's nothing spectacular here. The only reason I bought is because I'm a runner and I wanted to add it to my collection of running movies. If you're not a runner, I would pass on it. If you're a runner then you might want to take a look at it.",1354579200,,274,4.0
