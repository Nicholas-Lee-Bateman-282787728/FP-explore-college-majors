8457682,5,B00559BXMK,"I first saw this in 1993 and have since seen it more than a dozen times.  The storyline is beautiful, complicated, heart wrenching and tragic.  A tale of divergent paths reunited, the impact of choices made as a youth, and the taunting question of what might have been different if he had chosen the other path.
