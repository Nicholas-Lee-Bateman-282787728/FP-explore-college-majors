This is a decent portrayal of red state America, including one of the last interviews with the legendary Jerry Falwell before his death.",1239926400,9,272,5.348837209302325
2894888,3,B000T5MP72,"An interesting doc and worth a look, but it doesn't really deliver deliver the insights, or quirky charm that make ""Journeys with George"" so memorable. Moreover, Ms. Pelosi really fails to keep her bias in check this time around; one very unfortunate example is a bit of Michael Moore-style deceptive editing. A gay man silently weeps in church as the surrounding congregation sings ""God Bless America."" Very poignant, until you look closely and see that the singers are singing something else -- the vocals are dubbed. Watch with a grain of salt.",1236384000,3,547,4.956521739130435
2894889,5,B000T5MP72,"Andrea Pelosi seeks to shed light on the political strength of the modern-day Evangelical movement in the U.S. and its implications on the future of America's course.
Cruising through the heart of America, Pelosi interviews many prominent and not so prominent hard-core fundamentalist individuals, pastors, and organizations in order to demonstrate their ever-growing involvement in American Politics.

The issue that struck me the most was the efforts of organizations such as Answers in Genesis to imbue children with the pseudo-scientific concepts such as the coexistence of dinosaurs and man.  Even after autonomous refutation by the scientific community, this hard-core fundamentalist camp still seeks to turn young minds to the cause of ""Creationism.""  Personally, I believe that this deprives children of one of the most cherished gifts: the ability to think for one's self.  In more ways than one, this is child abuse of the worst kind.

As a gay man, I must give credit to Pelosi for including a prominent gay clergyman in the documentary.  I always have theorized that fundamentalist-evangelicals have felt the necessity to continue to demonize the GLBT community for the fear of losing their jobs.  The day the GLBT community merges with the greater American community, is the day the fundamentalist-evangelical movement runs out of steam. The very idea that homosexuals have the same rights as other citizens!!!

In short, ""Friends of God"" is a very important documentary for the personal collections of the political warey.  Liberals and political conservatives alike will enjoy this dvd.  Of course, one must always consider the biases of the creator.  Pelosi is a self-described atheist and the question of her own intentions for creating this documentary is ever present.  Does she seek to simply make the evangelical-fundamentalist movement look bad or does she feel an indepth sense of purpose to perform her patriotic duty?  All the same, I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and hope others will enjoy it as well.",1212969600,10,2025,5.290625
2894890,5,B000T5MP72,"I've read several reviews that throw around terms like ""liberal"" and ""biased"".  I can only blame it on two things; offence and ignorance.  To deny that people like this exist is absurd.

There are extremists in every group which are unfortunately louder then those who are sane - thus generating the bad reputation that a lot of these groups end up with.  This documentary showcases such crazy extremists.

I will never understand why politics started mixing so heavily with religion, as religion is NOT the birthplace of morality.  But that is another matter.

This documentary is entertaining moreso then it is informative.  I don't see an apparent bias, as Pelosi barely speaks with the exception of asking questions, which tend to be general and not particularly pointed or offensive (unlike Micheal Moore) as evident by the relaxed nature the interviewees exhibit while answering the questions.  Yes, Pelosi may be a liberal, but that does not in and of itself mean that she is biased or hates Christians or any other absurd things said in the reviews on this website.

See it for yourself and make your own decision.  Just understand that this documentary is about fundamental  Evangelicals and is NOT about Christianity in general, as stated in the film's description.",1212883200,16,1275,5.019047619047619
2894891,2,B000T5MP72,"This film plays like a college student's project. I really liked ""Jesus Camp"" and I also really like some of Alexandra's previous work so I thought this would be a good bet. Unfortunately not. Very poorly edited, poorly structured, unfocused, boring, and shallow. Did not offer any additional insights (negative or positive) on the ostensible subject(s). If you are interested in this subject then rent/buy ""Jesus Camp"" and if you are interested in a solid doc from Ms. Pelosi rent/buy ""Journey's With George.""",1206489600,9,510,5.156626506024097
2894892,3,B000T5MP72,"So yet another Indy documentarian decides to temporarily forgo the lattes, the latest issues of The Nation, and the Loft in Soho, in order to head out to Flyover Country and film the weird and creepy antics of Christian Fundamentalists. In manner similar to the ""Jesus Camp""  auteurs, Alexandra Pelosi carefully couches her expedition in neutral, measured tones; she very much wants us to know that she's not there to judge, but just to record.

Yeah, right.

""Friends"" is just another Chiller Theatre presentation aimed at scaring the urban liberal elite out of their wits while relaxing on the couch on a rainy Saturday night.  We are treated to footage of the late Jerry Falwell crafting an army of dedicated, wholesome Christian youth who will work to emplace Family Values in the American legal system. There is also footage of various evangelical pastors and `inspirational speakers' drilling little kids with the idea that evolution is nonsense, and there is no way dinosaurs lived on the earth millions of years before people made an appearance. There is footage of Ted Haggard, who was also featured in ""Jesus Camp"", extolling the power and promise of the Christian right. (Ted, of course, has since finished a `Christian' Re-Education process after being found to have dalliances with a gay prostitute. Ted now insists he's Reformed, and raring and ready to get back to the preaching scene,  but for some reason his mentors are uneasy with this request, and are keeping him on a short leash as I write this).

Just in case liberal viewers are still complacent after the first 45 minutes of the documentary, we're shown footage of a gay man, deeply pained by the Hate being directed against his community by the fundamentalist agenda, attending one of Falwell's sermons. Pelosi takes exquisite care to rapidly cut from shots of Falwell at his pulpit, to our saintly Alternative Lifestyle Person sitting in a pew, who soon drops his head, brings his hands to his face, and cries (or giggles, it's hard to tell which) at the cruelty and injustice he must confront  in this troubling new age of religious extremism...

Maybe one day there will be some `balance' to this issue. Maybe one day, some clean cut Christian kids from Georgia will gather some video equipment and head to San Francisco and the Folsom Street Fair, and get some footage of a Leatherman lolling on a streetside platform, inserting a dildo into his rectum and smiling at passersby. Maybe the resultant documentary, about how the Queer Nation aims to seize control of the American social order, will be a big hit at Sundance.  Maybe it will show up in the finalist lists at various award shows, and maybe it will garner a hour-long interview on some PBS radio segment. But I doubt it will happen soon.

So for now, if you're a white, urban liberal, and you're in the mood for a good scarey movie, you can't go wrong with ""Friends of God"".",1206230400,6,2914,4.81
2894893,4,B000T5MP72,"So-called Christians like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are the sort of preachers that rulers of the U.S. empire like.  They take a radical faith that preaches peace and care for the poor, and turn it into a club to demonize gays, liberals and people of other faiths and nations.

Pat Robertson has supported some of the most violent dictators in the world, people like Charles Taylor in Liberia and Rios Montt in Guatemala.

Robertson also assisted the Contra forces in Nicaragua as they terrorized peasants and blew up health clinics.

Osteen and others are there to ensure people that, with enough belief, they will prosper.  It's a theology that deflects attention away from corporatism and politicians who are gutting social spending.  Meanwhile, Falwell and Haggard will cultivate resentment toward various minorities (until, that is, they are exposed as having purchased some tender moments with a male prostitute), and will posture about their ""pro-life"" positions while people die from U.S. aggression, a lack of health care, workplace sickness and accidents, and a poisoned environment&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Greener-Faith-Religious-Environmentalism-and-Our-Planet-s-Future/dp/0195176480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Greener Faith: Religious Environmentalism and Our Planet's Future</a>.
Instead of concerning themselves with the message of the Christ to overthrow unjust rulers and build a kingdom of peace, they rally their flocks to vote for right-wingers, thus ensuring more war and entitlements for our modern-day Roman rulers who wear suits instead of togas.

Pelosi's film does a very good job of documenting the group-think that has seduced millions in the U.S. and in other parts of the world where communities and economies have fallen apart.  She could do another film on the influence of ""Focus on the Family,"" which is conveniently located across from the US Air Force academy (the world's leading state terror training camp) and has a radio program aired on a couple thousand stations around the world.
According to Air Force veteran and staunch Republican Michael Weinstein, evangelicals have bullied their way into the hearts and minds of many cadets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-God-on-Our-Side-One-Man-s-War-Against-an-Evangelical-Coup-in-America-s-Military/dp/0312374836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With God on Our Side: One Man's War Against an Evangelical Coup in America's Military</a>.

So, maybe a future documentary on evangelicals can interview those people who are working for peace, tolerance, environmental stewardship and economic justice.  Evangelicals aren't all reactionaries; but with figures like Pat Robertson and John Hagee dominating the airwaves, many good-hearted but misinformed people will be seduced by a pernicious political agenda posing as ""Christianity.""

2894894,5,B000T5MP72,"As a pastor ministering in the ""Christ-haunted"" South, I thought that ""Friends of God"" gives an accurate image of a religion that justifies American culture and a so-called religious ideology while at the same time, ignores the plight of the poor and the wars that we have created while creating an atmosphere of fear, ignorance and intolerance.  For instance, I don't believe that Jesus would ask us to be ""pro-life"" while supporting capital punishment and an illegal war at the same time.  I don't believe that Jesus would have us gather to worship in pristine ""mega-churches"" while our urban areas decay and millions of American children continue to be left behind by both the Democrats and the Republicans.  Jesus calls us not merely to worship him, but more importantly, to follow him--not to justify ourselves and our own culture and lifestyle--but to advance the Kingdom of God.  By that, he ministered to the poor, downtrodden, and to those on the outside of the mainstream who might be different than us.  (Sorry about the short sermon!  It's a great and thought provoking documentary!)",1195862400,45,1095,4.989010989010989
2894895,2,B000T5MP72,"Alexandra Pelosi, daughter of U.S. Speaker of the House and well-known liberal, Nancy Pelosi, put together this documentary, ""Friends of God,"" in which she travels throughout the South and interviews numerous Evangelical and Fundamentalist Christian leaders and believers.  While I have absolutely no problem with poking fun at people, even Christians, Pelosi's documentary left a sour taste in my mouth.  Camera angles, the condescending tone of Pelosi's voice to certain interviewees, and careful editing all come together in this film to make most Protestants look like idiots.  Sure, many Evangelicals and Fundamentalists can come across as loopy, and their actions often provide humorous moments, but the majority of them are intelligent, value-centric people.  When Pelosi interviews leaders such as Jerry Falwell, you may not agree with everything he says, but he has a legitimate argument for his stance on certain issues.  When Pelosi talks to the husband and wife who home school their multiple children, both he and she come across as firm believers in their faith even though Pelosi's editing tries to do otherwise (especially with the wife).  The Christian comedian she interviews brings up a number of good points as to how Christians have been filtered out of the mainstream.  They have all given great thought to what they believe.

Anyone who has taken a basic television or film course in college will quickly pick up on the way Pelosi shoots many of the people she interviews.  Low angles, wide angles and clip editing all combine to make most of the people in this documentary come across as unintelligent or close-minded.  However, despite all of this trickery, many of the people she talks to make perfect sense.  The bottom line is this:  Even when you try to make people look like idiots with camera and editing tricks, the truth always comes out.

Some of the people Pelosi talked with are extremists even in the Evangelical community.  These people do provide for some humor.  I honestly believe that this is what Pelosi hoped to do with all of the people she talked to in this film.  Instead, she makes those folks with legitimate and intelligently thought out views seem that much more relevant.

As with most liberal-leaning attacks on Christians, this film takes time to point out a Christian leader who has fallen.  Pelosi points out that Ted Haggard, once considered a strong leader in the Evangelical fight against homosexuality, found himself in quite the homosexual tight spot shortly after the making of this documentary.  This is par for the course in many liberal attacks against Christians.  They relish in hypocrisy which, in the liberal world, really can't exist if there are no values with which to compare it to.

In closing, all I have to say is that this documentary is blatantly a propaganda piece.  There are Christian films that lean in the opposite direction, but instead of using editing to create the validity of their point, they usually are straightfoward with their findings.  I am Catholic and have directly dealt with a few of the extremists that Pelosi enjoyed parading on the screen.  However, the bulk of Evangelicals and other Protestants are normal people just like everybody else.  Had Pelosi tried harder to understand why the people in her film believe what they believe and less time trying to make fun of them, this documentary would have been much better.

If you'd like to watch a comedic shot at Evangelicals, check out the film, ""Saved!""  I'm sure it will offend most extreme Evangelicals, but the majority of people will get the joke.  ""Friends of God"" will probably draw big laughs from the liberal crowd, and if you're one of them, you'll definitely want to see it, otherwise, pick something else up at the video store.",1193184000,12,3792,4.995222929936306

I do, however, think the video misrepresents the attitudes of many Christians in the south.  Most of those interviewed were of an extreme evangelical bent at best, or even cult fanatics operating on the fringes of Christianity.  They do not represent all Christians.  There are many who pose more moderate positions on the issues of creation/evolution, homosexuality, and the completely ""literal"" translation of selected passages from the Bible.  As a southerner, I resent the implications that this biased production presents.",1436400000,,666,5.355769230769231
2894899,2,B000T5MP72,"Friends of God (2007) is an unflattering look at Evangelical Christianity from documentary filmmaker, Alexandra Pelosi. Ted Haggard, a once-prominent Evangelical, is featured throughout the film expounding his views on morality and politics. At the end of the documentary the viewer learns the former pastor and former head of the National Association of Evangelicals resigned his positions in disgrace due to a scandal involving a homosexual affair and illegal drugs shortly after the filming was completed. The message: Evangelical Christianity equals hypocrisy. Jerry Falwell, former leader of the Moral Majority and a major player in the push to involve Evangelicals in politics, pontificates throughout the film on efforts to ""reclaim America for Christ.""

Friends of God certainly isn't Evangelical-friendly (with Haggard and Falwell being their own worst enemy) but I wouldn't expect anything different from an unbeliever. ""For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God"" (1 Corinthians 1:18). ""There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death"" (Proverbs 14:12). But I agree with Pelosi that Evangelical involvement in politics is problematic. Falwell, who died shortly after this film was completed, basically tells his congregation who to vote for in upcoming elections. The notion that America is a Christian nation that must be defended against encroaching, valueless secularism is extremely popular among Evangelicals. American nationalism and patriotism are routinely and fervently preached from Evangelical pulpits. But the Scriptures teach that when a person accepts Jesus Christ and is born again they become members of God's ""holy nation"" and are ""foreigners and exiles"" (1 Peter 2:9-11) while they dwell on this earth. Better that Christian pastors and churches concentrate on evangelizing the lost instead of trying to usher in God's kingdom in America through politics and government. The Puritans tried that, too.",1407456000,,2037,5.425867507886435
2894900,3,B000T5MP72,"What this documentary shows is definitely out there in the U.S., and this DVD shows it in an entertaining way. But to people who do not know any better, what Pelosi focuses on here is only part of the larger story, which is much more complex. American evangelicalism in fact includes huge sectors that are much more moderate, thoughtful, balanced, and internally complicated than what this DVD shows. So it is somewhat misleading about the bigger reality.

I suggest that Pelosi do a documentary on Tim Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church in her own hometown, NYC. That would provide some needed balance and complexity.

I also suggest anyone interested in this topic reading my book, Christian America?: What Evangelicals Really Want (California, 2002).",1349654400,2,758,5.154471544715447

2894902,3,B000T5MP72,"""Friends of God"" is a road trip through the America of fundamentalist Christians. There are some great, enlightening scenes in this documentary, but the whole seems to be less than the sum of its parts.

Two scenes from Friends of God stood out for me. There was one in which a woman described how much better her life had become since she dropped out of college, adopted fundamentalism, and became the mother of eleven children. She says one thing, but she looks as though she is harried and miserable. The second scene concerned the door-to-door ""retail politics"" that Jerry Falwell and his followers use in their attempts to elect candidates who are friendly to their agenda. It gives the viewer a concrete idea of what is meant by the often-used term ""Christian Right.""

The film also has a number of scenes in which the Rev. Ted Haggard decries homosexuality; these scenes are mildly interesting, but the story of Haggard's hypocrisy had been told many, many times.

Unfortunately, director Alexandra Pelosi fails to tell a coherent story. So many documentary filmmakers seem to think that meandering around and shooting a bunch of scenes makes a movie. Doesn't anyone teach storytelling in film school?

This film is not a bad way to spend your time, but I have seen much more interesting films on the role of Christianity in the United States. I thought that ""Jesus Camp"" and ""Fall from Grace"" (about The Reverend Fred Phelps) were much better than ""Friends of God.""",1261872000,2,1473,4.856573705179283
