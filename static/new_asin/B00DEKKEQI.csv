This touching movie was very well done and in good taste so you can take your junior high kids to see it.  This was definitely ""Spirit-led"" and brings awareness to what is going on in an ""unseen"" world.",1375747200,10,276,4.612244897959184
5794887,5,B00DEKKEQI,"This is a great movie, moving, educational and spirit led.  A must see and a must do.  An authentic story about a  horrific problem in an unseen world that is very real today.",1375747200,13,175,4.242424242424242
5794888,5,B00DEKKEQI,"Not Today is a labor of love from Friends Media.  Like most productions with budgets that a large churches and investors can provide, Not Today has some weakness in the acting, editing and script.  HOWEVER, the message provided about the issues of human-trafficking is much greater than worrying about the previously mentioned details.

I teach high school students and encouraged them to see this movie.  Everyone of the students that went came back with ""I was surprised at the quality of the film and the impact Not Today had on me!""

A must see because it will open your eyes the slavery and trafficking that is going on; not just in India but every where world-wide.

As a person who has a degree in film production, the cinematography is excellent.  The acting is not horrible or too cheesy but is not perfect.  There are some editing issues, but quite minimal and doesn't change the quality of the storyline. The verbiage used could have been a little more natural, but the point of the movie is clear and presented very well.

The actors are heartfelt and seem to truly believe in the purpose of the movie. The actors portraying the Indian characters all do a really good job.

Buy one...no BUY TWO and give one to a friend!",1375747200,29,1232,4.635944700460829

Thanks for telling this story in such a way that my junior high aged kids could appreciate it without being hit over the head with gruesome images.  Tasteful, appropriate, hard-hitting, full of hope - that's how I would describe Not Today.  Thank you, thank you for making this movie!",1375747200,11,440,4.615384615384615

5794891,5,B00DEKKEQI,I've only seen the trailer so far.  I'm overly excited to see this movie when it comes to me on DVD. I drove 4 hrs when it was showing in VA but only to find out it was sold out.  It is devastating to me to think that all of this is true...not made up.  It breaks my heart that these parents think that by selling their children its their only option to eat or survive unfortunately in most cases that's the truth...it is their only option.  Its an option for them but not the children. If you can pre-order this video...your support is all these kids have.,1375228800,12,557,4.12962962962963

5794894,5,B00DEKKEQI,"Great movie, although heartbreaking to watch. My husband and I just returned from living in Nepal for two years, and witnessed the aftermath and horror of child trafficking, as it is very common there as well. And as this movie shows, in many cases it is family members who have been conned into thinking they are doing something good for their children who are actually the ones handing them over to the traffickers. This movie does an excellent job at portraying a very real problem, as well as ways to get involved to do something about it.",1441411200,,543,4.608247422680412
5794895,3,B00DEKKEQI,"The message of Not Today was a very important one. It was eye opening as well as moving. The actors played their parts well, but I was not fond of the way the subtitles were presented. Subtitles were needed as translation for the words spoken by the characters from India. Instead of white lettering at the bottom of the scene, the words were displayed in various positions on the screen: sometimes sideways, sometimes in a wave, and sometimes across the characters themselves. Not knowing where the words would appear and having the lettering for the words vary, distracted me. I felt that the words made you lose the emotion of the scene. Also, it took a while to get into the movie. I liked the second half better than the first. I felt that the boys bad life, prior to his accepting Jesus Christ, was just too drawn out. The messages of how Jesus can change a life, how Jesus wants us to meet the needs of others, and how sex trafficking is a real, terrifying, and sad situation- one that we need to do something about, are however, all important. Overall, I liked the movie, but I wouldnt give it five stars, for the reasons listed above. The quality of the DVD itself was fine, other than one dented corner on the paper box  cover. The disc was undamaged.",1439769600,,1261,4.482608695652174

5794929,5,B00DEKKEQI,"I thought this movie was well acted and in good taste.  Whatever your belief system, it brings to the spotlight a subject that is in desperate need of our attention here in the West.  The problem of child slavery is something that needs to be continuously brought to the forefront, because it has not gotten better nor will it until more people get involved.  This movie convicted me of my need to do just that if even in a small way.",1399075200,,434,4.333333333333333
5794930,5,B00DEKKEQI,"To Save a Life did it with today's teen issues. October Baby did it with abortion. This one has done it in a two-hit whammy: human trafficking and India's social caste system.

When a spoiled rich kid wakes up after a hard night partying, he gets his eyes opened up to a world he never knew existed: human trafficking and modern slavery. This is a constant theme throughout, at first hinted at but then comes full in view. Granted, since it's an indie Christian movie, to get it rated PG-13, it had to have respectful camera angles, but the style of it is more like a documentary, revealing webs of connection between dealers and prospectors, heavy paranoia with each dealer, and the humane aspect of those searching for their loved ones to get them out and the strangers willing to put their lives on the line (eventually, after getting rid of their own pride).
On the other hand, starting from a single line the secondary character says (""We're Dalits, we can't go in.""), it's also revealed that India still suffers from extreme inhumane practices today- the caste system. Dalits (Indianized word from the English ""delete"") getting harassed and persecuted for the most trivial reasons, made to believe they're literally less than human. In one scene, when a dealer makes a point that the secondary main character's a Dalit, the main character blows the concept out of the water with a monetary challenge. Beyond that, he really doesn't care about how the whole country treats Dalits, though he does get annoyed about the severity of which they get hurt.
One of the most unique features of this film (besides the very end which shows a promotion for a ministry helping Dalit children get education, food, clothes, and other needed resources) was how they did the subtitles. Instead of the normal computerized fonts in white or yellow, they used kinetic typography (the same style used in music lyric videos), that was impressive. Even more so was how they used a different writing font for each specific character who spoke Indian, no matter if they were integral characters or only spoke a few words in the whole movie. Sometimes, the subtitles went the extra mile to be educable (such a the line about Dalits not being people? The word ""Dalit"" was shown above both father and daughter, a circle and line interposed above both ""Dalit"", that was uniquely creative for a movie). At a couple times, even when the main character, an American, spoke, he would say something so profound to the father that what he said was also typographized to make a clear point to the audience as well. If only more movies featuring a different language could be as creative with their subtitles.
The only problem I had with this movie was how the main character's girlfriend and mother tended to sound preachy. Up to a certain point, they seemed to think that prayer had all the power to stop every bad thing until the point came when they had to actually physically help. Even as a Christian, I know that one cannot pray and think that's it. At times, one has to put their faith in action. Beyond that, I seriously recommend this.

My rating: 4.5/5",1397606400,,3132,4.7344322344322345
5794931,4,B00DEKKEQI,Excellent movie that highlight a subject that needs it. The situation it depicts is common in India where it occurs but most don't know it is happening even in our local communities in the U.S.,1397088000,2,193,4.542857142857143

5794933,5,B00DEKKEQI,Received my order quickly. This is a great movie.

Unless you knew what the movie was about walking into (or sitting down into) it, then it might be hard for the viewer to grasp the purpose of the film.
I am glad that I have it in my collection of DVD's because at least this movie makes an attempt to bring to light the reality of human trafficking. It helps you understand what drives a person to sell their child or how easy it is for us to overlook someone because of our botched perception of them. It left with the need to do something. Maybe it didn't have everything that I was looking for in film but it did achieve it's purpose in making aware that there are more dire things in need of our time and attention other than our own gratification.",1377993600,3,932,4.183333333333334
5794964,5,B00DEKKEQI,"Five young American men decide on a whim to go to India for a party vacation to meet girls and party.  The main character becomes involved with a local father and daughter who are begging for food to survive.  When the main character learns that the father sold his young daughter to give her a better life, the story begins.  He explains to the father that the young girl was sold into the sex slave industry.  They both begin a journey to rescue the young girl. The story details the faith transformation of the American and the hope in God that they will find her and become reunited.  The power of prayer, determination, and action in the face of evil is present in every day life of the poor people for this class of people in India.",1377907200,,738,4.357664233576642
5794965,2,B00DEKKEQI,it was very very boring it was horrible and it did not meet my expecttations it was really lame and wouldnt recommend it,1377734400,,120,4.260869565217392
5794966,4,B00DEKKEQI,Not graphic enough.  Being involved with human trafficking and abuse of women in Rwanda.  The story should have been more representative of the facts of trafficking.  It was okay but just short on impact.,1377648000,,204,4.9411764705882355
5794967,5,B00DEKKEQI,"This film is a truly compelling look at the plight of the Dalits of India and the tragedy of the human slave trade. Out of the almost 30 million slaves in the world approximately 80 percent are women and over half are children.  This film is an excellent way to introduce a discussion about human trafficking to your family, friends, church, youth group, or more. It is tastefully done so as to be viewed in mixed audiences.

The film is very well done; the filming is of good quality, and the acting good. The actors portray their characters in a genuine heartfelt manner. Though some have pointed out that the scripting may be weak in some areas let me assure you that whatever weaknesses might be found in no way takes away from the powerful message of the film.  It truly touched my heart and I have heartily recommended it to others.

When a family member became involved with a full time rescue organization for women and children in the Sudan our family became very aware of the awful reality of human trafficking.  It has changed the way we think and live for the better.  It is a good thing to have one's eyes opened to the pain and suffering of others and to realize that each of us can, and as fellow humans have a responsibility to, make a difference. Let this film help open your eyes....",1376784000,,1301,4.445378151260504
5794968,5,B00DEKKEQI,It was a very breathtaking movie and very moving. Caden Wells played by the talented actor and musician Cody Longo was amazing. He played a young man who fights to save a little girl name Anika in India from child traffickers. This isn't just happening in India it's happening all over the world and the US. These parents are told that they are selling their children for better lives not knowing they are used as sex slaves or hard labor. Very gripping story that everyone should see. There wouldn't be a dry eye in the house.,1376352000,,527,4.5
5794969,5,B00DEKKEQI,If Harriet Beecher Stowe had been a film maker.  This would have been the type of movie she would have made.  This film brings to light the true story of young girls that are enslaved around the world!!!,1376092800,,203,4.315789473684211
5794970,2,B00DEKKEQI,"I have no idea why anyone rated this a 5 star movie: It is a 2 star at best.  Although there is an important underlying message, the script is over the top with religious zeal and not believable.  It seemed like every other word was ""pray"".  The lead actor is a self absorbed teenager with limitless cash and his parents let him fly off to India with his buddies for good time partying and then is shocked that there are poor people there (how stupid can you get).  He feels guilty that a little girl gets sold into slavery by her father and tracks her down.  The blond guy from Dukes of Hazard is the step dad and did I mention that they pray all the time.  Overall this movie was a major disappointment.",1375920000,3,705,4.223880597014926
