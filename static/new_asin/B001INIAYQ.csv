8311198,5,B001INIAYQ,"This is a wonderful historical DVD about the creation of the sweet grass baskets in Charleston, SC. The music by Chamber Music Charleston is superbly done and the acting is fabulous. This is a very beautiful DVD that I would recommend everyone buy both locally and nationally. This CD makes wonderful Christmas presents and would also serve as a great educational video to show to school children. Highly recommended in every way! A must buy!",1256774400,,442,4.906666666666666
8311199,5,B001INIAYQ,"This DVD inspired me to look for the stories that each of us are living and the connections we all share. Owning a sweetgrass basket is a source of pride for Charlestonians, but until this cultural event, I was unaware of the depth of the story behind the art form.  The adaptation of William Grant Still's music, by Chamber Music Charleston, makes the story come to life even more.",1228176000,,382,4.536231884057971
8311200,5,B001INIAYQ,"There are a number of ""stars"" in this short film of Margot Theis Raven's children's tale: Rachel Dowling's compassionate reading, E.B. Lewis's evocative watercolors, the moving (and witty) score by William Grant Still performed with real sensitivity by a string quartet, and especially the touching, haunting, soul-stirring words of Margot Theis Raven herself.  The ""circle unbroken"" stands for the sweetgrass baskets themselves, but also for the bonds of tradition and family and community and hope across oceans and across generations even under the conditions of enslavement, dehumanization, and war.  Great for both children and adults.",1224633600,,640,5.726315789473684
