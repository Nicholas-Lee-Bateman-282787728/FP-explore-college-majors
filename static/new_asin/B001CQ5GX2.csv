8288620,4,B001CQ5GX2,"This is great for beginners to the makeup field. If you have any REAL experience this is all review. But don't get me wrong, this is a great tool for inexperienced people. I was just expecting a little more.",1444694400,,207,4.333333333333333
8288621,5,B001CQ5GX2,Great video but it took a long time to get.,1423958400,,43,3.4
8288622,2,B001CQ5GX2,"A lot different than I was expecting.  I thought I would get real information on FX makeup and pro tips, not home DYI cheap halloween makeup effects. The whole video is only about 28 minutes. Expected much more from a great artist like Dick Smith. It's also irritating that he refers to a book that doesn't actually come with the DVD. It's an interesting watch, but save your money if you're looking for an ACTUAL FX tips DVD because this is more for a cheap throw together makeup.",1421280000,,481,4.465909090909091

8288626,3,B001CQ5GX2,I liked the dvd...it was a bit slow sometimes but the part that really upset me was that he keeps referring to the booklet that comes with the video(this was originally VHS) and NO BOOKLET comes with this dvd so there are lots of recipes for his monster make up concotions that you don't get.,1355875200,,292,4.327272727272727
8288627,5,B001CQ5GX2,"No problem with the video, aside from it's too short.  I wish more makeup artists would do little demo videos.  That said, I got this for a kid who's interested in makeup and it turns out the DVD has some previews heavy on violence and nudity.  Just a heads up.",1343088000,,261,4.18
