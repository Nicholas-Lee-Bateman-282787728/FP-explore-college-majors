4162456,5,B003ONXB9C,"""Takedowns and Falls"" chronicles one complete season on the wrestling team of Central Dauphin High School in Pennsylvania. The cameras follow the team and individual wrestlers and their families from the start of practice through the state championships. If you have an interest in high school wrestling, this movie provides a far-ranging view of wrestling through the eyes of both highly successful and less successful team members. The best parts of the movie are the many interviews and takes involving Head Coach, Jeff Sweigard. A classic wrestling coach, he is witty, caring, and a supreme motivator who must coach his skilled but problematic son, overcome early team losses, and fight lymphoma throughout the season.  The movie beautifully exposes the time pressures, competitive pressures, and physical demands faced by high school wrestlers as they piece together a team that has a chance to place its first wrestler on the top step of the state tournament podium since the 1970s...and succeeds beyond its wildest expectations in an emotionally-charged, and true, ending.",1403395200,2,1079,5.384615384615385

4162459,5,B003ONXB9C,"Thank you!!! This is a hard to find documentary about a Pennsylvania highschool wrestling team. It follows them along from preseason to the district finals.

4162461,5,B003ONXB9C,"A good viewing for anybody who has ever wrestled or whom are interested in wrestling.
