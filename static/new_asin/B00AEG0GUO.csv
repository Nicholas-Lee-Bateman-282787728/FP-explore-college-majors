8550528,5,B00AEG0GUO,"This is an excellent documentary interspersing contemporary filming of the National Park Service dive with archival footage, both U.S. (mainly newscasts of the day) and personal Japanese photography and film.  Because of limited dive time, the dive team concentrated on the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV3), the IJN Battleship Nagato, and submarine USS Pilotfish (SS-386). The underwater photography is very clear, no murky or blurry shots.  The film exposes the plight of the Bikinians forced to flee their beloved home and to live in ramshackle housing on a small nearby island, living only on substandard food provided by the United States, waiting for the time they can return to Bikini.  Interior shots of the Saratoga show planes still in the hanger and also shells in their cradles that never exploded and are actually ""live"" ammo, which could explode at any time.  The planes and the carrier itself have numerous types of fuel onboard.  This film is spectacular in it's filming and, historically,  very disturbing at the same time.  It was outstandingly narrated by Linda Hunt.",1462320000,,1088,5.182857142857143
