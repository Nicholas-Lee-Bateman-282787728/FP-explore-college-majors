7878984,2,6304633874,"Lev Kuleshov's BY THE LAW is one of the masterpieces of Soviet silent cinema alongside the films of Eisenstein and Pudovkin. But instead of this ""public domain"" version I recommend that you hold out for a better DVD of the film. If you can play PAL discs, Edition Filmmuseum has released a restored version with optional English subtitles. You can find it on Amazon.de under ""Po Zakonu.""",1297728000,5,387,4.791044776119403
7878985,5,6304633874,"If you're interested in the development of Soviet cinema, you really need to see films by Kuleshov's collective. They produced some of the most innovative and entertaining films of the 1920s, and this video has two of them, one directed by Kuleshov himself and the other by a pre-'Mother' Vsevolod Pudovkin.
In 'By the Law,' one can see the roots of 'Soviet' montage, a fine sense of framing with acting that is pretty close to perfect for a silent film (i.e. not quite pantomine, not quite theatrical and not quite what we'd get used to in the sound era). On top of that, the story is exciting and engaging, with an ending that you won't quite expect, even with the other reviewer giving away part of it. If you're a Pudovkin fanatic, like me, you'll also like seeing 'Chess Fever' which has beautiful comic timing, more early montage, and a terrific sense of space and design (watch for chessboard patterns on walls and floors!). It's too bad that Pudovkin couldn't do more comedies, silent or sound, but it's not as if he wasted himself doing dramas.",1041552000,2,1053,4.666666666666667
