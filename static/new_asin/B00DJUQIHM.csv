5819533,5,B00DJUQIHM,"Brilliant circuit workouts to get you in the best shape. Pretty tough, but there is a modifier to help with the more difficult exercises. Excellent value for money.",1381968000,2,164,4.892857142857143
5819534,5,B00DJUQIHM,I work a 12 hour shift and have always believed I don't have time to workout. This quick 20 minute workout is high intensity and really gets the job done! I love the pyramid format that really helps you get through each set without quitting :) thanks to Monique for making it so much fun!!,1381968000,,289,4.2727272727272725
5819535,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I have been a big fan of the X-Train gang for a year or so, having purchased their last home course, and I love this new programme even more.

There's not so much demonstration and waffle in this set (sorry Stephanie)  But the result is a much quicker workout.  I can get through a session, including the super sets, and shower in about 40 minutes, which  leaves me no excuses!

The workouts are great with easy to follow cues and three levels of intensity, making them suitable for beginners through to advanced.  The set comes with wall chart and handbook full of training and nutrition tips with recipes and meal planners.

I do love the completeness of these sets and I find that if I take the pictures, follow the chart etc. I am  much more likely to keep going with it.

Well done to the X-Train team for all the hard work and research that has gone into this.

BRING ON THE NEXT ONE!!!!!",1381104000,2,894,4.363636363636363
5819536,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I was looking for a good workout series that I could easily do at home in the morning before work. These DVD's are perfect--each DVD is a little over 20 minutes; I can choose to do one or two workouts in the morning. Either way, I get a good workout--even after 1, I am dripping sweat!  The DVD's come with a guide & some dietary help, which is nice. If you work out fairly often, these will be a good addition, especially on days when you are trying to squeeze a good workout in! The instruction is very clear, and she offers various modifications for different ability levels. You don't have to have too much equipment--all I needed was a set of dumbbells & an exercise mat.  They use an exercise ball at times, but you could get away without one. Overall, awesome workout!",1380672000,6,775,4.375
5819537,5,B00DJUQIHM,I was so excited when I found out this was being released and literally could not WAIT to buy it.  I am so pleased!! I love that not only do you get the workout DVDs but all of the tools you need to start living a healthier life come bundled with it! I love how fast paced the workouts are.  It keeps it interesting and it's never boring! So glad I bought this product!,1380067200,5,369,3.972972972972973
5819538,5,B00DJUQIHM,"This circuit burnout is just the right amount of time for someone like me, just needing to tone.  Monique is energetic and entertaining especially when she says ""Heather or Natalie Girl"". Having the two levels is helpful so the actions doesn't seem so overwhelming.  Circuit Burnout is AWESOME and hope in less than 15 days I will see the results.",1380067200,,347,4.766666666666667
5819539,5,B00DJUQIHM,"Whether you are just starting to think about working out, or a fitness expert looking to add a little extra oomph to your running routine, Monique is a fantastic motivator! With high intensity and low intensity options and modifications, it is easy to customize workouts to fit your ability level, and still get in a great burn with a great balance of cardio and weights! The ladder-style time frame makes the workout fast-paced, and it is over before you know it! I am on day 14 of the routine provided with purchase, and I am already seeing results. I am SO GLAD I bought this program!",1379980800,,587,4.547169811320755

5819541,5,B00DJUQIHM,"This workout video is beyond workable.  No matter your fitness level this is a fun and challenging workout. Monique as shown on the cover makes you want to go the distance - it is upbeat, gives you energy to go the extra mile to get that workout done - what energy is shown with such expertise.  Makes you feel like you are in the video a part of what is showing on your TV screen. Look forward to hitting the play button as many days as I can fit into a week.",1373068800,8,460,3.989130434782609

5819543,5,B00DJUQIHM,"Love this! I love the schedule most of all, I can always fit this in daily. I'm sore every day, using muscles I haven't used in forever! The price was beyond perfect, and I love the modifications of the workouts and how they encourage you to work at your own pace. I'm 19 days in and I can't see a huge difference yet but I do feel much stronger!!!",1485129600,,348,4.057971014492754
5819544,2,B00DJUQIHM,"After using numerous Beach Body workouts over the years, this one fails in comparison.  I know that BB is a huge conglomerate and is able to have the best... but I can hardly use these dvds.
Not much cuing, cheesy direction  (""babe"" ""guys"")
I'm probably going to donate.
Also, if I hadn't read the reviews I wouldn't have known you need hand weights or resistance bands and stability ball.",1484611200,,389,4.6231884057971016
5819545,5,B00DJUQIHM,I love theseeing workouts . It's my go to when I need to get a good fast workout in ...it's only 20 minutes but you get a good workout . You can tell production isn't the best which is why it's cheaper . But for me I'm here for the good worlout not how glam they make it look. Such a great price for 5 different workouts.,1482537600,2,321,3.8059701492537314

5819547,5,B00DJUQIHM,Great workout for the price of the set.  The workouts are intense but not miserable.  Great way to add some variety to my workout program.,1480723200,2,138,4.48
5819548,5,B00DJUQIHM,I love this workout! It gets my heart rate up and adds weights! I am sore after every workout and I love that feeling!! It's great for $15! I never heard about this workout before I only heard about beach body programs and crunch and so on but those were so expensive and long! These workouts are about 25 min long and you can't beat the price. I am recommending to my friends and I will be doing them again and again!,1480377600,,418,4.109756097560975

5819554,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I'm on week 2 and decided to go ahead and write a review because I have a lot of positive feedback. The workouts are 20 minutes long so there is no excuse to not do my workout!  I can definitely feel the muscles that I worked from each previous day's workout. Great moves. Full body workouts even when the dvd is focused on a particular body part. Fast paced to keep my interest and makes the already short time go by quite quickly! Monique is a good instructor and positive. Modifier options from gals in back. I have several workout dvds and I am very picky... and I really like this dvd set. I recommend it. You cannot beat the price!

The reason for 4 star rather than 5 is because the sound is of poor quality. Instructors mic is a bit muffled. But you can still understand her. Normally that would bother me enough to give up on the DVD's but that is how much I like the workouts.",1473811200,,886,4.205882352941177
5819555,2,B00DJUQIHM,The workouts are well balanced for advanced and intermediate levels. No complaints about the Circuit workout routines. However this particular product does not function on any of my DVD/Laptop drives. I had to buy g to my work download a DVD and email it to my personal email. Enjoyed the workout but definitely not what I paid for.,1472688000,,332,4.741379310344827
5819556,4,B00DJUQIHM,Good workout.,1472342400,,13,6.0
5819557,5,B00DJUQIHM,"These are great tapes, you will defiantly feel your muscles burning. I like that it's a short about 20 minutes workout. It comes with a calendar that tell you what tape to do and on what days. ON each tape there are variations in the exercise for beginner, intermediate and advanced, so it would work for anyone. Some of the exercises include the use of a workout ball and I use 2 sets of weights when I do the tape. You will defiantly be sweating! some people say her voice is annoying, but she's just peppy. also, some people complained about the sound quality, but I didn't notice that.",1471824000,2,589,4.412844036697248

5819561,4,B00DJUQIHM,I purchased this for a group of teachers to use this summer but the Total Body Disc doesn't work. We love Monique but would really want that workout!!,1465430400,,150,4.392857142857143
5819562,5,B00DJUQIHM,If you actually follow the routine you'll see good results!  Everyone will notice a difference,1464652800,,94,5.266666666666667
5819563,5,B00DJUQIHM,excellent workout,1462406400,2,17,8.0
5819564,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I've done P90x and have various other long, challenging DVDs in my collection, but they collect dust b/c they are so long or slow-paced. Circuit Burnout work-outs move quickly and include moves I've not done on other videos, so it keeps me challenged. You can also increase intensity with more weight or varying technique to customize somewhat. Monique does a nice job with motivation and tips, but the main thing for me is quality of the moves she puts together and the quick pace at which the work-outs are delivered. It's perfect, and for $15, you cannot beat this value. I add more cardio on the weekends, but for weekdays, the video is all that's needed. These are similar to the Jackie Warner Power Circuit Training DVD, which I also recommend.",1462320000,2,750,4.732824427480916
5819565,2,B00DJUQIHM,"So let me start by saying this is the first time I've ever felt like I needed to leave a review on Amazon. I wasn't very impressed with this workout series. The woman leading it is rather awkward as are the people doing it with her. She's not very encouraging and the quality of the video itself is pretty bad. I usually go with anything beachbody but thought I would give this a try, and I'm really rather disappointed.",1461628800,,420,4.329113924050633
5819566,5,B00DJUQIHM,"Not as fancy as BeachBody videos - but does what you want it to do in 20 minutes.  PLUS each workout gives you a SUPERSET and you can kick a little more butt for an extra 6-8 minutes.  You can modify out workouts if they are too tough, but she does get my heart rate up, sweat rolling, and muscles sore each time!  For under $15 - it is well worth the investment.",1461542400,2,363,3.9452054794520546
5819567,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I am a huge fan of Stephanie's so was unsure of a new trainer. I knew it would be hard to find someone I liked as much as her. Monique did well in her own right through, not overbearing or rude.
I bought this in hopes of shedding the last few hard to get rid of pounds before a cruise, and definitely will see them gone. Thank you for yet another bmgreat product",1459641600,3,362,3.9726027397260273

5819572,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I very much like this Circuit Burnout set of DVD's.  Great workout in 20 mins.  Audio is not great but it is understandable.  I would have given this 5 stars but the Total Body DVD does not work, nothing on it, not readable.  Very disappointed when I came to my morning work.  I hope that this review is read and it can be replaced.  That would WOW me!",1455235200,,352,4.102941176470588
5819573,3,B00DJUQIHM,"I just started day 1, abs & burn. The workout is good, but I feel like they sped through to get the workout done in under 20 minutes. If they went a little slower, the workout would've been more effective. The other thing is that Amazon states you need a stability ball and resistance bands. The workout uses dumbbells.

I'm an intermediate level exerciser, and this made me sweat, but I'm not sure if I'll feel the burn tomorrow.",1455148800,,430,4.443037974683544

5819575,5,B00DJUQIHM,"Really good, challenging workouts.  Very satisfied with the quality too.  Instructor allows a few breaks which really helped me recover.  I like that the workout is not too long but have the option to extend it an extra 5 minutes.  Also, price is great for this exercise program.  Would highly recommend.",1454630400,2,304,4.882352941176471

5819577,5,B00DJUQIHM,This 20 min workout kicked my butt!!! I am out of shape but I was able to keep up by doing the low intensity workout. Definitely pushes you which is what I need.,1452816000,3,161,3.909090909090909
5819578,3,B00DJUQIHM,Rather boring and redundant activity. I use it twice a week though with the sound turned off.,1452470400,,93,4.529411764705882
5819579,5,B00DJUQIHM,Great for early morning quick but effective workouts.  Each of the 5 dvd's has a 20 min circuit with the option of an additional little 3 minute 'super set'.  Which is a nice high intensity add on basically.,1451779200,2,207,4.421052631578948

5819581,5,B00DJUQIHM,"for 15 bucks its more then you can ask for! I bought this 2 years ago and it sat in my closet. finally I dragged it out, and decided to use it. I have p90x, turbo sculpt, turbo burn and a million Jillian michales, some other random DVD's throw in in there as well. This I feel like the results are similar to turbo sculpt just in half the time. at first I was both way behind physical (could not do a proper burpie to save my life) and some of the moves were just too easy, that is until I added heaver weights. Now, it's day20 and I can almost keep up on burpies, I sweat more now then the first week. I think because I am trying more, so there is less standing around. I had a baby 7 months ago and have no excuse anymore for the extra.. Lbs, lets be honest most had nothing to do with the baby. The 20 min workouts are so perfect if you are getting back into working out, if you have no time, if you feel little motivation at the end of the day. These have made my life easier! and What better review could I give then that? Yeah, I look/feel better, 10 lbs gone so far.
The sound quality is not awesome, but the music is not annoying and neither is she. Even if you only go through this once it's still cheaper then a gym membership. One month 15 bucks, no gas, no babysitters. Awesome I say.",1448236800,23,1296,3.9884615384615385
5819582,1,B00DJUQIHM,My 1 star rating is based solely upon the fact the 2 of the DVDs don't play. I haven't even bothered trying the others. This was such a big disappointment. I tried the other set starring Stephanie Oram and loved it so I bought this one thinking it would be the same quality. Not even close. Why do companies risk their brand in order to save a few pennies in manufacturing? I don't get it. If you don't have a reliable product people will not buy. It really is a shame because I was so happy with the other set.,1447545600,,511,4.12

5819601,3,B00DJUQIHM,"This is a pretty good DVD, but I feel it is more appropriate for beginners like me. I'm not overweight - I just have extra pounds in all the wrong places and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Over the course of my life, I've worked out maybe around a dozen times total (usually by force at school).

That said, I found this/these DVD's easy to do and follow despite being a beginner. I like how they have you do warm up exercises in the beginning to loosen up your body/muscles and get your heart pumping. I'll do an update once I'm done with the 30 days to tell you guys if I have noticed a difference or not, and how much if so.

That said, a few things bothered me about the DVD's:
1. Before starting, they don't tell you ahead of time what type of equipment you'll need. Nor is it listed anywhere else, like on the box or in the brochure.
2. In my personal opinion, the girl (lead instructor) has an annoying tone/voice.
3. They have modified, easier moves for those who can't do the regular moves. However, most moves don't have a modification. The ones that do, the modifications are hard to pick up because they keep cutting out the girl who does the modified moves from the movie frame!",1438300800,6,1192,4.316964285714286

5819608,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I started this programme as a way for me to get my Super Sexy back (I'm always sexy LoL) and I have to admit that so far it's kicking my butt. What is really good about this programme is that each workout is short (approximately 23-25 minutes each). How Monique breaks it down is for you to do 3 or 4 minute workouts cycled with a 1 minute break and so on throughout each workout. The 3-4 minute sessions can be intense but most of these moves can be done by anyone; there is also the added benefit of her having two additional girls that show you the low impact and high impact versions so that you can tailor it to your skill level. Also included in the box for the programme is a meal plan booklet and calendar which gives you healthy meals options as well as shows you which workouts to do each day or if you will get a break. Another benefit is that they also provide super sets for each workout so when you feel that you have the ability to do a longer workout you get an extra 5 minutes to add to the previous workout which you just completed. By The way, you will need weights (dumbbells at the weight of your choice), a mat and a stability ball to do these exercises; all in all a very good programme.",1432944000,7,1210,4.13135593220339

There are plenty of options for sound and the music is okay.

Things don't always go as planned when you have small children, but I can definitely find 20 minutes in a day to dedicate to exercise! Also love that it comes with a 30 day schedule so you know which workouts to do and when. I think the range of different workouts is perfect and it really gets your entire body in shape. I like that also it comes with a little nutrition guide for those of us who aren't too great with eating healthy or aren't sure what a balanced meal should look like.

THESE workouts, however, are 20 minutes (23 if you include the 3 minute Tabata-style ""Super Sets"" at the end). Don't let the length of the workouts fool you--they are intense!

Muscle burns fat at a faster rate.  This workout is a ""circuit"" workout.  Meant to get your heart rate up and then back down again (sort of like HIIT training).

5819654,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I guess I put too much stock in some of the reviews I read. This is NOT for beginners, as some reviews lead you to believe. The video seems very amateur though (possibly that's what they meant instead of beginners). There were a lot of moves I'm physically unable to do at the moment; maybe they will come with time if the work out supplies results. The music didn't bother me nor did the instructors voice, as some reviews said.

As I said before.. the video is amateur. But I'm okay with that. It gives it a more low pressure feel to it, I think. I wouldn't consider this a workout for somebody just starting. I'm seriously overweight and I cannot do everything they put on here (not even close). However, I enjoyed what I could do and it did get my heart racing. If you're a seasoned athlete, this is probably not for you. For the low intensity work outs, you'll need a stabilizer ball which I didn't read so I need to buy one of those. Also dumbbells are used a lot, so I recommend getting a set of those (I have 10lb ones I already owned and they work fine). You'll need a good amount of space for lunges and what not.

I do like the work out and I will continue to use it. Hopefully some of the things I am not able to do will come with time and practice. I feel like maybe I'm not getting the complete work out that I deserve since I can't do all the exercises so I follow other regimens on top of this one as well.",1389916800,11,1422,4.111510791366906

I like to have extra bursts of cardio. My one complaint is I wish the producers of the video had posted a disclaimer (similar to the P90x) videos of what equipment would be needed for the workout or if they had directed Monique to make the disclaimer before the warmup.

However, a balance ball seems to be required and I just don't have room for one and there don't seem to be good alternative moves to replace the balance ball moves. The production quality of this series doesn't seem to be very good. It felt like they needed a few more takes to get more polish on the final product. There are a lot of coordination moves and I'm just not good at those. I can do A move, but I can't do a series of moves in a coordinated fashion well enough to get a positive result. This is compounded by the speed with which the routines move. By the time I get the moves down, they have moved on to the next exercise. I was left constantly rewinding or pausing trying to get the workout done and stay on track. It was a frustrating experience. Monique has a nice personality, but I didn't really care for her banter. It felt awkwardly scripted and poorly rehearsed. If it wasn't scripted, then it needed to be. I don't like Jillian Michaels because she is so condescending. Monique was nice and supportive, but her delivery lacked an ease of flow.

It is so bad that they actually give you an option to watch without sound and music only.

If you can get past all of that, the workout itself is not bad.  Typical moves and gives a good workout in a short amount of time. I won't be watching this one much.",1384819200,8,534,4.267326732673268
5819665,5,B00DJUQIHM,Monique definitely knows how to give you a hard workout and keep you motivated through the entire thing. Absolutely love this DVD and loving the results.,1384646400,7,153,4.923076923076923
5819666,5,B00DJUQIHM,This is a great program for almost any fitness level. There are modifications shown for beginners which is helpful for me as I try to get back in shape after having a baby! I love that it gives you room to increase the intensity as you get stronger,1383955200,,248,4.1875
5819667,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I have been very athletic my entire life and know what a tough workout is.  This set is a great one-challenging for me, but I can see how others can follow along at their own pace!",1383609600,8,180,4.0
5819668,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I love this workout program! It is a great workout that can easily be done at home, and it requires very little time (just over 20 minutes). Monique is encouraging, and she offers modifications for all fitness levels. If you're looking for a workout DVD set, this is definitely the one to buy!",1382832000,,293,4.547169811320755
5819669,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I do not exercise - with that being said, I got this set in order to get ready for my 10 year high school reunion.  Being inexperienced in the work-out area, i was still able to keep up (modified some of the moves as told) and loved it.  This workout inspired me to continue to work out regularly and not just for special occasions.",1382832000,,332,4.171875
5819670,5,B00DJUQIHM,"I got my order yesterday.  I have the X-TrainFit At Home Workout - Women's Complete Fitness and use it regularly.  I was wanting some workouts that were shorter (for those days you just don't have the time) and decided to pick this one up.  I was nave.  I thought, how much bang can they stick in 20 minutes?  Apparently, they can stick a lot of bang into 20 minutes.  You'll walk away (barely) feeling quite accomplished.  I've only completed the Abs & Assets so far, but will definitely be putting the rest of the discs to good use.  Love the burn.",1382572800,3,550,4.376237623762377
5819671,4,B00DJUQIHM,Monique St. Pierre knows how to torture your body in a right way and burn off that extra layer of fat. Shorter workouts but they will sweat you to death. If you don't have time to do longer workouts then this program is good. Workout at your home and build a nice body with Circuit Burnout. I simply love it.,1382140800,3,308,4.15
8593864,5,B00DJUQIHM,The workouts were difficult for me but I now find myself moving a lot more throughout the day instead of standing in one place.,1520985600,2,127,4.333333333333333
8593865,4,B00DJUQIHM,"I am on day 21 of this program after not doing any type of exercise for over 6 months.  I would highly recommend this program if you have already done some type of workout program in the past.  I did Stephanie Oram's XTF Max 90-day program last spring (which I would also highly recommend) and I think that really helped me with modifiers for some of the moves.  This program can be for a beginner if you know some basic modifiers.  Each workout has three different intensity levels, but sometimes even the lowest level is too hard when you are just beginning, so knowing a step-down modifier helps to keep you working out while not overdoing it.  There are also super sets after each work out to give you a little extra fat burn.  I have not done any of the super sets because the 20 minutes alone have been enough for me right now.  I am planning on doing this for another 30 days and incorporating the super sets at that time.  Each workout is a pyramid type set up where you work out for five minutes and get a one-minute break, workout for four minutes and get a one-minute break and so on until you are done.  There is a warm up and cool down period also, so each tape is around 23 to 25 minutes.

After completing each workout, I really feel like I have had a complete work out and have some sore muscles throughout the day to remind me of my workout.  If you follow the 30-day calendar that is provided, you will notice that you are working different muscles each day which I think really helps in recovery and actual fat shredding since your body has no idea what is next.

Monique has a wonderful personality and I really enjoy her as a trainer.  She is motivational without being obnoxious.  She does love burpees though, so prepare for that almost daily :)

I took one star off because there are several times where you are not sure what exercise you are getting ready to do and you have to watch once through before you can start and also because the lower level intensity modifier is still pretty intense for some of the exercises.  I purchased this program for less than $15 which I think was a steal since I feel that this program is easily worth more given my results after only 21 days.  I feel much stronger already and I modified and still modify a lot of the moves each day.  I have a bad knee as a result of an auto accident and these workouts (and leukotape on my knee) have helped me build muscle while not re-injuring myself.",1519171200,,2450,4.3238512035010945
8593866,3,B00DJUQIHM,"After the first week I can definitely say these are a great workout. I've been sore for the better part of a week. Lol Downsides, the sound isn't so great. Also she has 2 sidekicks one for modification and one for advanced..but you don't always get to see what those advanced or modified moves are. (And the modifier looks like a deer in the headlights when the camera is on her). All in all I think it is a good work out for the price.",1503446400,,436,4.141176470588236
8593867,1,B00DJUQIHM,I just started using X- TrainFit circuit Burnout this week.  I promise person of deferent level. I did know I would need a stability ball to complete my work out. it was added as something I would need.,1495756800,,202,4.315789473684211

8593873,1,B00DJUQIHM,"After completing Stephanie's 90 day program, I was hoping this DVD would work out well. I was 100% wrong! In the training guide, it tells you all the equipment you need, right?! No! Only on the Amazon description does it tell you you need a stability ball! I was very angry when I had to skip a section of each disk because it didn't tell me I needed one!
Also, on the last page of the training guide it says ""there are 4 levels demonstrated in every workout"". There is only 3 girls, not women, on each disk. Each girl is suppose to be a different level, but you clearly can tell that each one is doing basically the same level. I think that is completely unfair!
Last but not least the warm up and cool downs are absolutely pathetic. Before and after doing such an intense workout there needs to be a longer warm up and cool down. I've never been in such pain for so long. Why should I have to do more of a warm up and way more of cool down when the disk is done? Monique does not stretch each body part that will be/was worked. I do not recommend it to anyone.",1486339200,2,1062,4.110576923076923
