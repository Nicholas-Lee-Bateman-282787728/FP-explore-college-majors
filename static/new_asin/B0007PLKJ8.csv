I was itchin for Kevin to rip Give Thanks, but they took it down a couple keys, so I kinda felt a lil cheated, but he still killed it tho. But other than that, every song is HOT!!! The band kills every song, and the vocals are always point! This dvd is worth pickin up!",1240617600,,385,3.825
8377757,5,B0007PLKJ8,"I actually attended this concert live in Jacksonville, Florida last year. The DVD is a wonderful representation of how great they sound live in concert. Their debut CD is wonderful and the DVD just takes it to a whole new level. The musical arrangements are on point and the vocals are right up there with the likes of Donald Lawrence, Fred Hammond, Karen Clark-Sheard and other greats in the gospel music arena. The only thing I would say I wished it had would be a 5.1 surround sound mix. I think it would really bring out the vocals and music even more. Other than that the DVD is wonderful!! My favorites are ""King of Kings"", ""Spend Some Time"", ""Give Thanks featuring Kevin Bennett"", ""Heaven"", and ""Because of You""! If you love gospel music and especially love ministry then you need to get this DVD it will bless you tremendously and shows what happens when you put together gifted and anointed artists who have a heart for God and live to worship Him!!!",1111536000,,959,4.5813953488372094
