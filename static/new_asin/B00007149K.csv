1800032,5,B00007149K,"In this time of terrorism, and global strife this was a night that brought us back to happier times. THIS SHOW IS PAUL MCCARTNEY'S GIFT TO AMERICA AFTER 9/11. It was the perfect time for this type of tour. Paul gave the audience exactly what we all needed. For me it was a three hour grin, with an occaisional tear in my eye. I was privledged to see Paul @ The National Car Rental Center in Sunrise Florida. Paul brought back the Beatles and Wings for our absolute pleasure for the entire show, save for 3 new songs. We were in row 2 on the floor, literally able to see the whites of this ex Beatle's eyes. It was goosebump city for almost 3 hours. From his opening number ""Hello Goodbye"" to ""The End"" we never sat down. He made his audience feel as though we were sitting with a bottle of water, and a hot dog in his livingroom just playing for each and every one of us personally. When he played ""All My Lovin'"" with the old B&W images of The Beatles arriving at JFK in NY on the huge Plasma screens above the stage it was like being in a time warp. It was almost surreal. It was truly like the air was sucked right out of the arena. With apologies to The Corrs It left me, and 15000 others ""Breathless"" I have a bootleg DVD of the Washington Show which is an 7 on the quality scale with closeups lacking. The real deal will have all that and more. Paul MCCartney is the consumate performer and definatly a bather in the fountain of youth. His unmistakable exuberance, and joy was evident during his whole show. He loved every minute of it. His eyes twinkled, and he smiled throughout the performance. Boy is age just a number in his case.
Near the end I was wondering whether or not ""Yesterday"" would be his last song. It was not, but when he played it, for me it was the crowning glory of the evening. I looked around and realized that I wasn't the only one with damp eyes in the room. Look for a 50 minute accoustic set about 40 minutes into the show. His voice is as clear as a bell, and he can still sing in the key's that he sang in 40 years ago. Spectacular is an insufficient word to describe it. This is an absolutely MUST HAVE DVD. I will remember the joy of this evening for the rest of my life",1035849600,19,2207,4.158878504672897
1800033,5,B00007149K,"I had the honor to attend one of Sir Paul McCartney's concerts in his Back in the U.S. tour in Houston, Texas on October 13th. The place was at full capacity and the concert didn't let down anyone who was in there. He sings ALL his most famous songs from his Wings era, his solo career and of course, his Beatles years. Only one song seems to be missing: Get Back. He didn't sing it that night and it doesn't appear in this list. But in spite of that, this is the best concert I ever saw!

Paul McCartney is in full form and sound on this tour and I just can't wait for the release of this DVD so I can relive it over and over again in my own livingroom. Paul summarizes his musical career in this show with the greatest live rock show I have ever seen and I believe will ever see again. He doesn't miss a note or a key.

He does all the same songs, from the cleverly chosen opener ""Hello Goodbye"" to the ever classic ""Sgt. Pepper.""  Other highlights include the rockous ""Jet,"" the sweet melodies of ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Mother Nature's Son,"" and the down-right awesome rockers ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There.""

1800059,5,B00007149K,"Paul McCartney: Back in the U.S is a concert film by Sir Paul McCartney,who is half of the singing and songwriting core of The Beatles,together with the late John Lennon. Also,he stands among the most influential figures in 20th century music as part of The Beatles,who changed the face of popular music forever together with guitarist,the late George Harrison; and drummer Ringo Starr.

McCartney assembled a new live act composed of Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray on guitar, Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums and keyboardist Paul Wickens, who had been on McCartney's last two tours. Also,the concert film is a celebration of his past, with a substantial sampling of his solo work with and without Wings as well as his Beatles songs that he has co- written with Lennon.

Although he may still refuse to act his age as he provides great performance act at age 60 to the delight of his fans,this concert film lacks a documentary that would have somehow given details about Sir Paul at present when this film was released. Also,the behind-the-scenes footage and/or interviews between every performance affects the continuity. Better editing is required to make this a classic concert film.",1431129600,,1177,5.0

1800062,4,B00007149K,"I bought this DVD after having a suspicion that the order of the songs on the CD wasn't quite the same as the order done in concert. In particular, I suspected that ""Sgt Pepper/The End"" came before ""I Saw Her Standing There."" I wanted to find out so I could put the songs in the ""correct"" order on my iPod playlist.

A number of reviewers dinged this for not being strictly a ""concert DVD,"" and for adding a lot of ""useless fluff."" I suppose that if what you expected was a video presentation of only the concert and nothing else...sort of a video version of the CD...then you'd be sorely disappointed.

On the other hand, if already owning the CD, you approached this with an open mind, you could see this as a great documentary of this particular tour. Sure, the openings of some songs were covered up by dialog from the talking sections, but that's OK...at least it was to me. After all, I have the CD for if I want pristine versions.

Of course, one thing that won't be on the CD, and that you could only get on the DVD is where Paul breaks up during one of the songs at the last concert because of the emotion.

I say that this is the ultimate Beatles tribute band because anyone else doing the Beatles tunes would feel locked into doing them exactly note for note as they were recorded 40 to 50 years ago. But since Paul was one of the guys who did the songs in the first place, he was free to have his band stay within the basic framework while not doing a slavish copy. They were free to update and play as if the Beatles were still touring and keeping the old stuff fresh. And it was clear to see from this video, just how much Paul enjoys performing for a live audience.",1411344000,2,1680,4.240625

1800086,2,B00007149K,"Yes we love the Beatles and Paul. Paul's show and sound here are great, great, great!!!

The problem is that Paul has a hand in the production of the DVD. Remember Paul's disaster, the sophomoric Magical Mystery Tour? Well, here's another one.

Where do I start? How about the jump cuts? 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 20 milliseconds...cut, jump, cut, jump. We simply don't get to see the band play for more than say, 5 seconds at a time. Throughout the jump cuts, there's the awful audience cuts. Oh, another audience cut. And another. And another and another. Get the picture? Eye candy shots and teary eyed, I love Paul audience shots..ruining the dvd. And shots of movie stars in the audience, obviously to show just how important Paul is. Give me a break. Terrible. It really makes the whole concert unwatchable. And this isn't the only concert dvd from Paul that is produced, (I mean ruined) this way. Why can't we just get a nice, full concert taped so that we can actually see the BAND and only the band performing?

Paul-leese!!!

Putting in behind the scenes stuff in between EVERY SONG doesn't help either. Save it for the special features.

Learn how to produce a concert dvd the way we want it... a great concert with the greatest talent on earth, Paul McCartney and the band performing as the main focus. Who wants to spend good money on a dvd of the audience?? That's exactly what you're getting here.

1800089,5,B00007149K,"Paul McCartney's 2002 American tour was initially held in support for his album ""Driving Rain"", but it soon grew into something more. When the attacks of September 11th managed to affect everyone the world over, including Sir Paul himself, he knew this tour should be more than just something to sell a new product. Paul used the tour to promote the healing power of music, to ease the pain the Americans were feeling in the wake of tragedy with his music.

The tour turned out to be highly successful. To commemorate its success as well as emotional effect, a two disc cd and dvd both entitled ""Back In The U.S."" were released (I wrote my glowing review for the cd when it first came out 4 and a bit years ago).

Like the cd, the dvd of ""Back In The U.S."" is an incredible piece of entertainment. In addition to over 30 excellent performances of classics from Paul's Beatles years as well as his solo career, we see Paul interract with his family (the tender moments with Heather seem somewhat cheap now in the wake of recent events, but who cares), his band, his crew, and best of all his fans. We see the reactions of his loving audiene (be on the lookout for, among others, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas and other notable celebs enjoying the magic of Sir Paul's music), and it's truly a one of a kind experience.

Though it's not quite up to par with Paul's 1991 ""Get Back"", ""Back In The U.S."" is still an excellent representation of Sir Paul in concert and why he is the legend that he is.",1169337600,2,1496,4.432727272727273
1800090,5,B00007149K,"If you like McCartney or are interested in seeing what he's all about, you can't go wrong here.

As with all his other concerts, this performance demonstrates his wide range of talents.

There's the obligatory Hey Jude, Let It Be, Live and Let Die, etc... along with enough songs that he'll probably only play once (Hello Goodbye, Lonely Road, Mother Nature's Son, Getting Better, Something,...) to make it worthwhile.

Yes, there are plenty of audience shots, but you come to expect this with any concert video.

The only ""ouch"" is Freedom, right up there with some of his worst songs.

On the other side of the equation, you have Lonely Road - a real sleeper. One of my favorites - I'm surprised it never really caught on.

People will look at this concert 100 years from now and say ""wow"".

Mind you, same is true for his other concert DVDs.",1168560000,3,844,4.586666666666667
1800091,3,B00007149K,"McCartney and his band sound great, but the latest thing in concert DVDs is to show the audience.  Why?  An occasional shot would be sufficient.  As an occasional concert-goer, I am aware of the impact the crowd makes on the atmosphere of the concert, but that just cannot be duplicated on a DVD.  Show the band playing their music.  The songs on this are great and the band plays with elan.  Recommended music, DVD less than satisfying.",1163030400,5,437,4.6103896103896105

Paul has assembled a top-flight group of musicians and support personnel making for a delightful experience for both eye and ear.

Though the video is nearly three hours long, it is easy to make it a one-sitting viewing. I strongly recommend owning this or making it a great gift for the McCartney lover in your life.",1152316800,5,582,4.752475247524752

Well,you can judge a book(DVD) on its cover this time! Means...

-thumbs up is for Paul's concert performance. Very Good!

-showing the back of Paul is for the DVD production. Whata shame!

-and when you see the back cover...Paul seemingly would say..This DVD isn't totally OK.

1800095,5,B00007149K,"I went to Cleveland, OH to attend this concert. I was incredible and this live DVD is a good representation of how it was great. Sound mixing is OK if you have a good sound system. Picture quality is nice and camera angles are numerous and not steady. This allows the viewer to enjoy every musician performance while watching the concert.

For the price, it is a really good value. Sure, you won't get hours of extras, but the ones there are great, not like many other DVDs. Here is what you get :

An over 2 and a half hour concert with the best of Paul McCartney, Wings and the Beatles. Along the concert, you get a few very short interviews so you don't miss any song. The setlist is good with a mix of very old, old and newer songs. A few songs have never been played live (getting better...).

You can also enjoy a few exclusive songs never played live on the warmup check sound (matchbox for example). There is a short documentary about the tour. Short, but interesting... no lost of time !

This is a really gret choice for music fans and music DVD collectors. How many live DVDs give you over 2 1/2 hour of great music for less than 20 $$$ ?",1118880000,,1149,4.232876712328767

There are earlier concert films out there. For me, the huge disappointment here was technological. Why, in this day and age, is this presented with a 4X3 picture?? More importantly, what's the deal with the comprerssion in the audio? The clarity of it is just fine, but it does not take advantage of the dynamic range of DVD technology. The pyrotechnics in ""Live and Let Die"" should shake my living room floor! The compression applied here makes them sound like mere firecrackers. Paulie, PLEASE! Give a look and a listen to some of the other concert DVDs out there (Peter Gabriel, James Taylor, to name just two fine examples) and see what a DVD **SHOULD** be!! I'm really glad I rented before I decided to buy. Since I already own all this music (much of it many times over), the only reason for me to buy this DVD would be for high quality, high impact sound, and it's totally lacking here.",1114041600,,1064,4.546875
1800117,4,B00007149K,"With all due respect to the previous reviewers, I think rating this DVD is a matter of perspective.  If what you are looking for is a video (as opposed to a film) of the concert itself, that is to say, if you want to be able to sit back and feel like you're watching the concert in linear fashion as though you were there, then I agree with the other reveiwers that this DVD is a disappointment.  But if you are seeking a documentary film of the Back in the US tour that includes much of the concert but also includes commentary, crowd shots, interviews, etc., then you will find this DVD very fun to watch.  I agree with the other reviewers that the fast cutting from shot to shot during the performances gets annoying.  I'm sure the editor thought that the fast cuts would add ""energy"" to the film.  Sorry, but it's simply annoying.  I attended the concert, so watching the film brings back happy memories.  But make no mistake about it, this is a documentary film of the tour, not a video of just the concert.  The visual has all the grainy the shortcomings of film versus video, but if that's not a priority for you you'll enjoy the DVD just the same.  So, if you want something that's more of a pure concert video like ""The ""Concert for George"" or ""The Doobie Brothers Live at Wolf Trap"" or ""The Moodie Blues at Red Rocks"", you'll probably be disappointed with ""Back in the US.""  But if you're interested in a documentary film of the tour that happens to include quite a bit of music, then you'll probably enjoy this one.",1111536000,7,1526,4.379432624113475

1800120,3,B00007149K,"I am an avid fan of Paul McCartney and loved the audio CD of this concert.  This DVD however, was quite disappointing and annoying to watch.

This would be a great music DVD if it were not for the editing.  This DVD would feature only one song (with a very annoying panning back and forth between the musicians and the audience), then feature backstage interviews from musicians and crew, then another song (with the same annoying back & forth), then interviews of cast/crew, etc.  If you want to see only the concert songs, you have to use your DVD remote and press ""skip"" all the time.

I wished they would redo this concert footage altogether. Please play the whole concert by itself and focus on McCartney and the musicians (who are great)/ we don't want to see the audience!  Put the interviews of cast/crew -- rehearsals as a separate feature in the bonus features.

On the plus side, some of the songs done by McCartney and band are great performances ""Band on the Run,"" ""Getting Better"" (1st ever live-performance by McCartney), ""Something"" (tribute to George played on ukelele), ""Here Today,"" (a very moving tribute to John), and many Beatle songs such as ""Fool on the Hill,"" ""Let It Be,"" ""Hey Jude,"" etc.

One comment: the playing list could include more songs from his Wings/solo period (like Call me back again, Junk, Letting go, Beware my love, Dragonfly, Getting closer, We got married, Souvenir, She's giving up talking, Rinse the Raindrops).

About the video: I sincerely do not understand why celebrities and emotional people were filmed all the time; the hysterical and irrelevant chit-chat seriously damaged the beauty of the concert. Why does McCartney/the producer feel the urgent need to show the world that he (and his music) is still so popular? Not very many people in the world would deny his large contributions to modern music, so why? In my opinion, he drags himself down by getting filmed like this. The wonderful and genuine concert movie ""Concert for George"" could be an illuminating example for his next concert registration!",1106006400,4,1005,5.1656441717791415

And when I do get to see the band, the camera angle changes every few seconds so it's not at all like experiencing the concert as the dvd advertises. 2) Where the hell are all those Paul's comments in between the songs? It's these kind of stuff that made the night of the concert so special. Of course I don't remember everything he said and if I can I really want to go back and listen. 3) What is up with all the behind the scenes indeed. Just make a special feature documentary and leave it there. I want the whole concert uninterrupted (the entire first verse of hey jude is gone here!) with the complete introduction (weird people, circus freaks, etc. starts showing up out of nowhere. If you went to the concert, you know what i'm talking about.)

I'm guessing this dvd wasn't made for people who went to the concert. Everything about this dvd is too commercial and they hired some bad editors.",1100649600,4,1030,4.364583333333333

As well as the concert footage, you the viewer are taken along on the tour. Paul resurrects Beatle tunes, Wings tunes and even covers some vintage Rock & Roll. He sings a song he's written for his fallen ally, John Lennon. The most moving part of this DVD is the final song on the tour. The entire entourage is in the audience and all hold up hearts...Paul was visually moved and as tears ran down his face, could barely finish the song as his voice ""quivered"".

Young or old, lifetime fan or ""youngsters"" just discovering The Beatles, this DVD will be a treasured reminder of the legacy they left for a generation.",1098748800,8,740,4.522388059701493
1800126,2,B00007149K,"The DVD of Paul's fantastic concert tour is a pathetic representation of the real experience.  I saw two of his concerts on this tour and the band's performances were excellent.  Paul spoke to the audience very candidly in between songs and it was obvious to us that they all thoroughly enjoyed playing their hearts out for us for two and a half hours.  Nine different cameras were used to film a concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and I thought the DVD would be a nice rememberance of this colossal night, but no...
The director of this DVD decided it would be exciting to give the audience equal camera time along with the band.  I got to know the people in the front row better than the band members themselves!  A quick close-up of an emotional fan is alright every few songs, but not every three seconds.  That makes as much sense as a TV camera filming a football fan cheering for his team while they are in the middle of running a play to win the Super Bowl!  The director might have thought that showing twenty different celebrities will make people like the DVD better.  Well, I for one don't need footage of Jack Nicholson singing along to ""Hey Jude"" in order to validate my opinion of the DVD. I bought it to watch Paul play, not to see Jack Nicholson in sunglasses four different times.
I wanted to see close-ups of Paul singing and playing, but there are much more wide angle shots, and very few close-ups of him playing the guitar chords and strumming along.  There was a time when Paul played ""Something"" and all we saw was his foot tapping on the floor.  Weird.  The DVD switched camera angles every two seconds - I wish the camera would've stayed fixed on one shot for a longer amount of time so I could take it all in and enjoy it better.  Hey, sometimes fast editing is important during certain songs, but I swear that there was not one shot longer than three seconds.  Having the closing credits run over footage of the band playing ""I Saw Her Standing There"" was also annoying.
Some of the songs were tucked away in the Special Features section of the DVD for some reason, which detracted from the pace of the concert as well as the overall experience of watching it.  The director also saw to it that many of Paul's conversations with the audience were cut short or eliminated entirely.  It was these spoken words to the audience that helped make the night very endearing, and special.
The Special Features section had five different segments of what happened behind the scenes, but they were also interspliced with the concert itself:  the DVD didn't show the opening segments of ""Coming Up"" but it did show Paul's advanced road crew talking about how many packs of cigarrettes they are smoking a day.  It drastically cut into the playing time of ""Hey Jude"", but it did show fans in the parking lot trying to sing ""Yesterday.  The guitar solo to ""My Love"" was deleted in order to make room for a soccer mom crying in the parking lot.  A guitar solo was deleted from ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" so we could see Paul visiting a monkey at a primate center.  When Paul played ""Something"", that was one of the most emotional moments of the entire concert, but the director thought it would be more prudent to trim off 30 seconds of that short song in order to show how the cook prepares food for the road crew. Hey, I'm all for seeing what goes on in Paul's life offstage, but NOT at the expense of the concert.  That's why the Special Features section is there!  If the director was concerned about the DVD not being able to fit everything on one disc, then why not trim down the Special Features a little, but NOT the concert!  Better yet, make it a two-disc DVD set!
On a brighter note, some of the interesting footage was of  Paul's different guitars he used during the concert, behind the scenes at ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"", and clowning around on their private jet.  The band also played an amusing, up-tempo version of ""Hey Jude"" during a sound check.
Note: this DVD was already in production when Paul changed his playlist and decided to include ""Michelle"", ""Let 'em In"", and ""Midnight Special"", so if you saw him play those songs, you really had a special treat!
The 1976 film of the Paul McCartney and Wings Rockshow is filmed much better, and will be a special collectors item when MPL Communications releases it - especially if there is a Special Features section which includes footage of ""Wings Over the World"".

Paul decided to cut up the two and a half hour concert to make room for the throw-away extra footage.  The concert was filmed very poorly in my opinion - quick cuts, many crowd shots, a bit disturbing to watch.  Paul could've redeemed himself if he had at least included complete versions of the songs, but again, some of the best songs from the concert, including ""Your Loving Flame,"" ""Freedom,"" ""Something,"" ""Hey Jude,"" ""Coming Up,"" are all only partially presented.

They should have named this DVD ""Fans of Paul MaCartney are back in the US"". When I watch a DVD of a performer ""I WANT TO SEE THE PERFORMER"", not his fans screaming for him. Why was everybody crying during this DVD???? I think there were alot of middle aged people in the audience that were wishing it was the 60`s again. I can understand why, Pauls voice was shot for this show, he cant hit the high notes like he used to. His band was mediocre at best, the sound was horrible, the drummer was good but way too animated in his playing, arms flailing about. Ringo should have sat in on this one.....anyways, nice video if your a huge fan but im not so I could take it or leave it.",1086307200,3,959,4.052631578947368
1800139,4,B00007149K,"I've read a few reviews online and frankly, nearly didn't buy this DVD, based on all the criticism about how the film was made. I've been a Paul McCartney fan since 1964. When I was a 10-year-old child, I was picked to be part of a ""band"" who pantomimed BEATLES songs around our town and actually got paid...once.
So, I come from a very sentimental angle; I was left-handed, so I got to ""be"" Paul. I've always loved his style - I could always tell when he was the dominant writer on a Lennon-McCartney song, so I'm here to tell you, I consider myself an authority on PAUL McCARTNEY!
This performance is stellar! The band he's assembled is FANTASTIC!! Especially love Abe, the drummer!! But, there was lots of criticism of how the DVD was produced. If you're a PAUL fan, you want to soak up as much as this DVD offers-and more!! The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating, was because I wish it had more songs on it that I would have liked to have heard. I loved the coverage of his old tunes (wish there had been more), to his WINGS era, (his tribute to Linda made me cry) and his modern stuff, like FREEDOM, he sang at the SUPER BOWL.
I enjoyed the interviews, the non-singing bits that they filmed scattered in with the music. This DVD also portrays the gentle, upbeat, whimsical, winsome side of Paul. There is a LOVE about which he sings, that he also lives. It seems to reflect in his band and staff.
The bit, right in the middle of the concert, where his staff surprises him with large ""heart"" cards scattered throughout the audience in front, where they were seated, literally takes his breath away... he gets so emotional, you can see he nearly wants to stop the song; but he goes on, like the consummate professional he is. That really touched me.
Another thing about Paul is that he's kept his life private and his marriage to Linda, undefiled. This guy could have had any woman in the world!!! Now, since Linda's passing, he seems to have resumed his zest for life in his marriage with Heather. He's a man's man.
There was also some criticism about showing super stars like Jack Nicholson, John Cusack, Sly Stallone Glenn Frey, Brian Wilson and others at his concert... hey, folks - face it. Paul McCartney changed the world of music 30 years ago, and continues to do so today! Get over it!! (...sorry, i don't know what got into me, except to say that anyone who chooses to pick this DVD apart, from a technical side, isn't seeing the real gems that comprise this film.)
When one hears the name ""Paul"" in the context of Rock music, of whom does one think? It's Paul McCartney, and the wonderful chemistry he exudes with his masterful blend of magic. With this staff of 125+ people, 12 semi-trailers full of stage set and equipment he brings to life a part of musical history that no one else on this planet is able to provide... BUY THIS film. You will not regret it!!!
There's nothing like his classic rock-and-roll style of music that is clearly and classically brought out in this film. It's a must-have for every collector.",1085875200,6,3045,4.4784172661870505
1800140,3,B00007149K,"I hadn't had the chance to watch this since its release, and I'm glad I finally got to do it. I enjoyed ""Blackbird"", ""Here Today"" and ""You Never Give Me Your Money/Carry That Weight"" (the latter is among the Extra Features) the most. ""Something"" and one or two other songs (""We Can Work It Out""?) were also highly enjoyable, but I'm afraid I wasn't much impressed by the rest of the concert film. First of all, I think most of the vocals are fixed/redone/enhanced for the DVD, which ALWAYS pisses me off (""Let Me Roll It"" - is that real?), plus God, the frequent namedropping (Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Tom Cruise et al) is excessive. I mean, how many inserts do you need? OK, OK, they were there, we believe you, man! A little bit more modesty and humbleness, PLEASE!  I love seeing audience reaction, no doubt, but, again, I thought there was more of that than say close up of the members of the band! It's more of a nostalgia/spectacular thing than a Rock show. Did I say Rock Show? Being a fan of the man's music, though, I don't regret the time I spent in front of the TV set, but I'm sure this could have been a much better DVD.",1083542400,4,1141,4.356807511737089

I'm a life-long Macca fan, I've seen him in concert 12 times, but this DVD is extremely disappointing. How so? Well, the picture quality is spotty, sometimes the screen is too dark, other times it's annoyingly bright. The sound quality doesn't sound like it was mixed correctly, it has a tinny edge to it. The bass lines seem fuzzy, the percussion seems too ""thumpy.""
It's disappointing, because Paul is a perfectionist (as you all know), and he rarely puts out something of this inferior quality. Something went wrong somewhere, but when a Beatles fanatic doesn't even get a tingly feeling when Paul launches into ""Hey Jude,"" you know something is wrong.

I own about 30 or so concerts and this may be the worst sounding of the bunch. Paul has a great band that is fun to watch,if only I could hear them. The sonic quality of this dvd is inferior in all aspects,save for vocals. Abe Laboriel Jr. attacks his kit with furious precision,but is muted,and from most accounts,this is not the case when witnessed live. The crowd noise is excessive,and painful on the ears. The directors fascination with star gazing,and the editors super quick cuts is also dissappointing. Paul Mcartney is not short of funds. With the availability of Hi-Definition cameras,and top notch audio recording equipment that many artists are utilizing today,there is no excuse for this dvd not to be of the highest calibre.

1800156,3,B00007149K,"I agree with my fellow Bostonian Martin Gregory, who asks, in his 10/10/03 review of this DVD, if Paul is ""really that insecure? If so, perhaps this explains his inability to perform a real, spontaneous rock and roll show, or release a visual record that doesn't spend most of its time trying to show just how revered the star of the show is."" For most of my life I have been fascinated and captivated by the Beatles and their mystique. They just won't go away. Their music, and some of it from the respective solo careers, is some of the best ever written or performed. So, like Martin, I am continually amazed at how Sir Paul seems to need his ego stroked, even after all this time. His music is tremendous, but this DVD suffers a lot from Paul's ""schtickiness""-- ooh, there's a camera...ooh, there's another. It's plastic, phony, and sometimes embarassing. He is like the anti-George. On the other hand, perhaps we would not have had any Beatle releases after Revolver were it not for some of these qualities. I just wish that someday Paul would put aside all of the campiness and schtick and production and release a straight ahead rock and roll no holds barred recording. In my opinion the best pieces of this DVD are the sound checks- they are simple, bare, essential, and even contain MISTAKES! But their rawness is what I find enjoyable. For all of Paul's lamenting what Phil Spector did to Let it Be, he has managed to do much of the same schmaltzy overproduction in much of his solo career. Here's hoping that some success for the Beatle's ""Let it Be...Naked"" results in Paul chucking all the artifice. He can do it, but I doubt we will see it.",1066694400,6,1654,4.553691275167785
1800157,2,B00007149K,"Paul McCartney's boundless ego and self-absorption are nothing new, but this DVD, like the concerts themselves, is a major disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the 2002 band was probably the best of McCartney's solo career, and there is much evidence of that on this release. No, the problem is not with the music, but rather McCartney's presentation of it, and his own on-stage routine. I went to all three shows in Boston on the 2002 tour, and by the third I literally could not wait for it to end. Each show had the same tedious jokes, phony forgotten words, hokey George Harrison tribute, and worst of all, the endless ""solo"" applause for McCartney. I'm sure he could have squeezed at least a couple more numbers into the set if he hadn't spent so much time standing in the spotlight, arms aloft, wallowing in the adulation. Save for a couple of set changes between the April and September shows, the whole thing was scripted to a word, and acted as such. Given this then, it is no wonder that the DVD record of the tour should reflect a similar disregard for the spontaneity of rock music. Instead of showing the concert as performed, we are ""treated"" to songs interspersed with more of the McCartney adulation routine; endless one-liners from adoring fans, a slew of shots of audience members waving ""I love you Paul"" signs, a short clip of Jack Nicholson, or some other celeb, grooving along in some VIP box. You get the idea.
It was revealing that around the same time as the release of the tour DVD and CD the whole ""Lennon-McCartney"" thing broke in the news, when Macca locked horns with Yoko Ono over his insistence on reversing the most famous song writing credits in music history to suit his own purposes. What really disturbs me is that there is just no need for McCartney to do all of this. Is he really that insecure? If so, perhaps this explains his inability to perform a real, spontaneous rock and roll show, or release a visual record that doesn't spend most of its time trying to show just how revered the star of the show is.

This tour, by the way, was a hundred times better than Flowers In The Dirt Tour of the late '80s, which I saw in Worcester, MA.  Paul's voice sounds so much better this time around (somehow - he's 14 years older now).  And it's much more personal and emotional than other shows, with his tributes to Linda, George and John.

It's obvious those who were at the concerts last year expected similar a treatement on this DVD. Whereas the ""fan"" opinion is opposite. I last saw Paul in concert in 1993 here in Sydney and it was the fulfillment of a dream seeing one of my childhood heroes in concert in the flesh.  Personally I enjoyed the DVD speaking as someone who didn't get to see him on this tour as he didn't make it down to Oz this time around. The ""interuptions"" were OK. I can relate to the comments made by the fans at the concerts..the music touched and still touches us deeply. Let's face it the man is an entertainer first and foremost. Yeah there were a couple of cheesy moments - the zoo apes particularly and it cut into ""Hey Jude"".  The song ""Freedom"" ""may have helped New Yorkers get over 9/11"" but it does come across a little too gung-ho and he's a pommy! (Bruce Springsteen's recent CD ""The Rising"" was probably the best example of how to approach this tragedy musically in a very intelligent, thoughful and non-jingoistic way). The behind scenes stuff puts things in perspective. The audience reactions to the ""Live And Let Die"" pyros reminded me of my own back in '93. But this is more a rock-umentary than a concert and if one approaches the DVD this way then it can be a very enjoyable experience. It's touching watching Paul's emotional reaction to his crew's ""last night heart surprise"" during ""Long & Winding Road"". Yeah he might have an ego but he's a guy that obviously tries to look after his own and his crews actions reflected that. When I heard Paul's ukelele version of ""Something"" on the CD I was a tad disappointed and annoyed by his approach as a tribute to George. However on the DVD he explains before the song that George was a great ukelele player. Now I understand the nature of the tribute. I'm no longer annoyed & disappointed but I would like to hear a more ""serious rendition"" of it  all the same Paul. He is backed by a great, cracking young band of musicians who are all obviously thrilled at being on the same stage as Sir Paul McCartney. Heck I'm an ex-drummer and I would be ecstatic at such a chance. It's typical of the standard of musicians that Paul has always surrounded himself with going back to the Beatles then Wings and his other touring bands in the 80's & 90's through to the guys he used on his ""Cavern"" concert and ""Run Devil Run"" album.
The concert performances are superb. While it may have been great to see the concert from go to whoa for myself I don't mind the approach of this DVD as I find it a little difficult to sit through a whole concert video in one sitting. The interviews ands other bits and pieces broke it up a little quite nicely.

Some might not like all the cutaways during the songs to audience and clips but I found it appropriate for the story line. Reproduction was excellant along with music quality.

What I didn't like, however, is that the DVD itself is very poorly produced.  Although my receiver can get Dolby 5.1, DTS, and most any other sound format, in order to actually receive the correct format I had to mess around with menu options and a variety of other settings.  Everytime I went to the menu for any reason and then returned to the concert, the program started over again from the very beginning so that I had to scroll through chapters to find where I was.  This was very annoying.  Also, on several of the special options, I got lost in a loop and had to completely shut down the DVD and restart to get back to where I wanted to go.  I believe the info on the package said there was 3 hours of material, but in fact, there's only 2 hours worth.
Another ""niggle"" is that the recording volumes are completely different on the music parts and the talking parts.  So you have to keep adjusting the sound or it's either too loud or too low.
I only wish Paul had attended to the amenities of the format as well as giving a great show.  Then it would have gotten a 5-star rating, in my book.",1053388800,5,1342,4.34
1800186,4,B00007149K,"Paul McCartney's Back in the US DVD is a concert film/documentary of his 2002 US tour.  Paul is right on for these performances.  His band is tight and his voice is better than ever!  The song selection is nice.  It's a good blend of Beatles, Wings, solo, and new Driving Rain songs.
As far as the DVD goes, it is good, but it could have been better.  I would have preferred a straight concert film with no interruptions at all.  All of the songs in the order played.  Then as a bonus, they could have had the documentary part separate, lasting around one hour or more.  It would have everything that is a special feature on the DVD, plus everything that they had insterted in between songs on the so called concert film.  What they've done, however, is changed the order of songs that they were played in, inserted a few things inbetween songs, (such as Paul meeting fans, doing interviews, or interviews with roadies and assistants) and ommitted a few songs.  There are 3 songs that can be accessed as a special feature.  Why weren't these in the concert film in the first place?  Also, most of the special features look like what they've put inbetween the concert footage.  For some reason, they've taken two different things (concert performance and behind the scenes stuff) and cut them up and put some of each in the main concert film, and the remainder as a special bonus feature.  Why they did this, I cannot figure out.  One 2 hour concert film of the songs alone in the correct order and then the 1 hour or longer documentary would have made an excellent 5 star DVD.  Another let down is a huge editing of Your Loving Flame (what might be the chorus is never played and they talk over the song) and the cutting of the first half of Hey Jude.  My Love, the best ballad on this DVD is also edited.
But don't let that keep you from buying this DVD.  This is Paul McCartney, after all.  Many Beatles songs are played here live for the first time ever and the old solo and Wings songs are given a more rock performance here.  His tributes to John (Here Today) and George (Something) are touching.  Band on the Run, Let Me Roll It, My Love and Maybe I'm Amazed are the most exciting performances on this DVD.  I think all of those are played (or presented here) consecutively.  Then of course come the songs that he always plays (Hey Jude, Let it Be and Yesterday).  The finale of Sgt. Pepper (reprise) and The End is fantastic.  The music on this DVD is amazing.  Well over 20 songs are presented here and most of them are complete performances.  I have Paul's live (tour) albums from the 90's and I've seen the two videos that coincide with those albums, but Back in the US beats them all!  Get this DVD and turn the stereo up for some of the best songs ever written!",1052697600,,2773,4.394891944990177
1800187,5,B00007149K,"Please,please me..? Yeah,yeah,yeah !! And you can please,please yourself immeasurably by buying this superb DVD archive of Sir Paul's sell-out 2002 US tour.
  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a music concert so much and I would consider this essential viewing and listening,not just for die-hard Beatles and ""Macca"" fans,but for anyone who is up for entertainment on a grand and damn near overwhelming fashion.
  The indefatigable McCartney took to the road again at the age of 60 and with a cracking quartet of young musicians (love that ""percussion power-house"" of a drummer that is Abe Laboriel,JR.) belts out some fabulous new incarnations of Beatles and Wings classics. The set-list is astonishing when you simply read it through in black and white and fills you with renewed awe and appreciation of the great man's astounding legacy of lyrics. In fact,trying to isolate ""highlights"" from the concert is a futile exercise because there is not a dull moment throughout,and in nearly 3 hours of footage,that's an awful lot of moments ! If you were to twist my arm,though I would rave about the surging dynamism of ""Back in the USSR,""Can't buy me love"",""Maybe I'm amazed"",""Band on the Run"" and ""Live and let Die"".On the other more contemplative side of the coin we get intensely moving versions of ""Here,there and everywhere"",""Something"",""My Love"",""Let it be"" and the really touching tribute to John Lennon,""Here today"".Also,there is a magical performance of ""Blackbird"" - a good candidate for my favourite song of all time- where Paul seizes his courage in both hands and sings it just to the accompaniment of his own acoustic guitar. Here,and throughout he is in fabulous voice and if that's what a vegetarian diet can do for a body,then pass me the spinach and squash !
  The atmosphere of the concert is electric and as one used to the reactions of rather more reserved British audiences,I really found it delightful the way the American fans lost all their inhibitions and collectively sang,cried and danced themselves silly all the way through ! Fantastic to see that it wasn't just rows and rows of baby-boomers down there and that teenagers,children and near babes-in-arms made up a goodly proportion of the capacity crowds. Utterly sweet and charming it was to see a little girl of about 7 years old clapping along (and smiling from ear to ear !) to ""All my loving"".That song may have been written 40 years ago now,but that wee lassie provided ample and concrete proof that it's appeal is absolutely timeless and each generation that comes along will simply rediscover the immortal and intrinsic qualities of such songs for themselves.
  I really enjoyed the back stage and behind the scenes clips that were interspersed between the songs and it gave me some great insights on exactly how such a mammoth undertaking as this tour can be transported from city to city with consummate professionalism and minimal loss of life and limb ! Great too to learn a little more about Heather Mills,who has done so much to bring Paul up and out of the deep,dark night of mourning for Linda. She seems like a really feisty North of England lass and if you were not aware that she had suffered an amputated leg after a horrific road accident,then you could never,ever tell,because she moves (and still looks) like the fashion model she once was.
  One annoying thing about these clips though was the ""unfinished"" story of the young lady who was an evident ""Macca-maniac"".She tells us that she had just lost her job and had come down to the concert venue,even though she couldn't afford the price of admission. No doubt appearing on her idol's DVD is some considerable recompense in the end but we are never told if someone took pity on her and she actually got into the auditorium. I really and sincerely hope she did and if anyone out there can tell me the outcome,then I'd be most grateful,because the suspense is killing me !
  As I type this review Sir Paul is currently taking Europe by storm with his ""Back in the World"" tour and I can't wait until he comes home to the UK so I can be a part of this tremendous experience in reality. In the meantime,all you folks out there can revel in the glorious ""virtual reality"" of this magical chronicle where one of the greatest  musical figures of our time takes his big,booming,Beatle's heart and wheel-like,joyfully rolls it across and to America.",1049241600,6,4402,4.837765957446808

I, too, was distracted by the non-continuity of the performance and would prefer the show in one piece and the rest made as a documentary or a ""making of"". They did it for the backstage thing and ""one the road with Paul McCartney"", so why not add these?
I guess that's why they called it a ""concert film"", title carefully chosen so that we can't say they misled us. Though they left us disappointed.
Mr McCartney, next time, please don't cut the show like this. For all of us who weren't there, it would be better left uncut. I also understand the fact that there were shows taped at different locations, thus the costume changes between songs, but that's OK. It's been done before with other shows where you could see this was a different city, but the show didn't stop. You know, editing...

And also, maybe next time, you'll make a world tour type of show, not just one country...

1800191,5,B00007149K,"McCartney is in top form on this DVD. This is not stale bread. The songs of the set list are put together and performed in an exciting fresh new way. This band is tight and they rock amazingly well. These are not a bunch of old guys getting together to jam. These are well-rehearsed, disciplined, talented and likeable musicians. I don't see McCartney resting on his laurels, relying on nostalgia. Sure, there is nostalgia. The whole fabric of the show is weaved with it, but it's not what carries the concert. The performances do. If you think McCarney can't rock, or he's over the hill, watch this disc.
As far as sound production, I watch this with my home theatre in DTS format, and it's great. The mix is believable. My subwoofer gets plenty of use, which can't be said of the original versions of these songs on CD or vinyl. The surround channels aren't solely used for audience ambiance. There is proper sound reflection. It sounds like you're in the audience with the best seats in the house.  The video is produced well too. The stage is bright. The camera angles are clean and unobstructed-unlike 70's concert films. Obviously, a professional choreographed each song. You also get to see Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglass, Howard Stern and others in the crowd rocking out with everyone else.
I can't say enough about this disc. If you rent it first at Netflix or Wal-Mart, I bet you'll end up owning it.",1048550400,2,1412,4.670682730923695

Yes, the editing is a little frenetic. Yes, there are a lot of crowd shots. Yes, the ape thing was a little stupid. Yes, cutting out the first half of ""Hey Jude"" is unforgivable.
Get over it. The DVD looks and sounds terrific. I was fortunate enough to be at one of his shows on this tour, and this disc tries to make you feel like you were there. It WAS frenetic. Watching the crowd WAS half the fun. And the disc makers thankfully edited out 99% of the preshow Cirque-like inanity.
When he confidently walks out on stage, and launches into ""Hello Goodbye"", I was transported back into the Arrowhead Pond. I cried (again) during ""Here Today"". I screamed (again) during the finale combo of the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's"" mixed with ""The End"". These are songs so embedded in my musical memory, I don't remember a time I DIDN'T know these tunes. And to see the guy...to hear the voice...responsible for those songs perform them with such enthusiasm...why quibble?
Get the DVD to see one of the few true musical geniuses the last several generations will ever see, perform immortal songs in front of an adoring crowd. What I would give to see Gershwin do ""Rhapsody In Blue"", Mozart on a harpsichord, Scott Joplin do a rag.

Also every self-proclaimed Beatles nut in the USA appears to have crawled out of the woodwork to make up the audience, which is shown ""getting on down"" at every opportunity. The picture quality is not sharp either, whether this is down to cramming three hours onto the DVD and thereby sacrificing resolution, I'm not sure. Surely Macca's got enough money to have made this a double DVD set for the same price as one.

If you want to see the concert now, you'll have to listen to the cd set, close your eyes and float down stream. I attended this concert in St. Louis, and realized after the first few songs that this was not going to be a smooth flow of the show. Several songs were omitted or  interspersed with backstage activities and shots of the crowd. I would have prefered, the concert be shown from start to finish and the extras left for remote menu clicking afterwards. The format really isn't any different than Paul's previous concert videos such as ""Get Back"" and ""Paul Is Live"". The soundchecks and extras were wonderful, but the continuity of this program is out of whack. Lastly, I agree with others that the video quality is somewhat grainy.

I settled in to watch the concert, ready to remember some of the electricity and magic of the brilliant concert performance.  My first impression was a cautious disappointment as the video quality looked like it was old ""Wings"" era footage, not the recent (2002) footage.  I gradually lost interest as the songs were interrupted with distracting interviews, and excessive shots of the crowd.
After having gone to many incredible performances by diverse artists such as the Rolling Stones and Alison Krauss, I was blown out by McCartney's live performance.  But the video?  I turned it off after five songs and haven't gone back to finish it.  No matter how I wanted to like it, I couldn't bring myself to do it.  And the second DVD for the friend?  I gave it to someone else and bought him a different Christmas present. because I knew he'd be disappointed as well.
If a different release were made available of the CONCERT, I'd snap it up in a second.  This presentation was sad - a lost opportunity to give to many people the performance of a lifetime.

I'm sure there are a  lot of people who have never seen what happens backstage at a concert arena, but I found the way it jumped between songs, interviews with fans, and interviews with the band, then back to concert footage extremely distracting. I would have much rather the interviews and extraneous junk been ""extra's"" on the DVD and not interspersed with the concert footage. It was really difficult to get the feel of the show without seeing it whole.
From what I'm guessing, there was some sort of costumed pre-concert something or other? During the footage of one of the sound checks, I saw some costumed people on stilts and a woman dressed to look like Marie Antoinette wandering around on stage practicing dance steps. The DVD never showed that part of the show. What a shame. With all the technical capabilities of DVD, this production didn't use any of them. Were I Producer/Director, I would have had the full concert from start to finish. Then I would have had an alternate audio track for Paul's commentaries like the director commentaries on some of the movie DVD's. The fan interviews, band interviews, sound checks, and backstage things would be extras on the disk for those who want to see it all. ...

1800259,3,B00007149K,"I grew up in San Francisco in the 60's.  I missed being able to go the last Beatles concert at Candlestick Park by the skin of my teeth.  I've seen many legendary performers at the top of their games, including Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Band, Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, the Stones, the Who, Buffalo Springfield, Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers.  With these past experiences, I can still say that seeing Paul live on the last tour was THE most magical concert experience of my life - an indelible moment. Unfortunately, the DVD is only a pale echo of that experience.  I enjoyed the ""behind the scenes"" stuff a lot, but interrupting performances is inexcusable.  For example, there is a little gem of a soundcheck where Paul and the band play ""Matchbox"", which is interrrupted with the most irritating and unnecessary editing and overdubs. A lost classic moment.  Repeated us of this kind of editing nearly ruins what could have been one of the great concert DVDs of all time.  With regard to the set list - the concert itself flowed beatifully, with generally very good mixing and juxtaposition of newer and older material.  A significant part of the emotional impact of the concert is lost by presenting the individual songs out of order.  To sum up, I guess I'd say that if you saw the concert(s), you will probably be somewhat annoyed and/or disappointed at the wasted opportunity this DVD represents.

There is no bigger name in the music business and no better look at a very big tour.  The musicianship is extraordinary and the material is classic.  For any collector of great concert performances, this should be at the top of the list.  The audio is not quite audiophile and the video is a little too MTV-ish to give it a perfect score, but it IS worth the price of admission.",1043020800,,627,4.1570247933884295
1800261,3,B00007149K,"I attended two concerts from the Driving USA tour in 2002.  I really hoped this dvd would be an accurate representation of what the complete show was like.  Instead, the apparent idea was to make a ""documentary"" of what it was like backstage and on the road, while also showing us songs from the concerts.  The DVD sometimes feels like a 2 hour promotional piece, straining to show what an ""event"" this tour was.  Well, having been there, I can say that it WAS definitely quite an event.  But this presentation doesn't really communicate that.
First off, what did I like about the DVD?  The performances that are included are uniformly very good and sound excellent.  Most of the songs from the tour are accounted for, whether in the main program or in the ""bonus song"" section.  As a McCartney fan, I want as much music as possible, and in the best sound quality possible.  A nice inclusion was a trio of performances from soundchecks.
So... I am left with a lot of negatives.  While I liked a lot of the 'backstage' and 'behind the scenes' material, I would've preferred it to be seperate from the concert footage.  That would've been perfect:  a concert presented in it's entirety, and a separate ""documentary"" showing how the tour was put together, etc.  But interrupting songs for interviews and breaking up the flow of the concert was not a great idea.
The picture quality is not very clear, definitely not what we've grown accustomed to for DVD.  The recent Eric Clapton concert dvd provides a FAR superior picture, for example (and wisely presents the concert from start to finish with no interruptions).
The worst offense by far was the editing of songs and the exclusion of certain songs (all of which can be found on the 2 CD set of the same name).  With DVD, it would've been easy to present the entire concert and still be able to organize all the 'behind the scenes' stuff as bonus materials.",1042934400,11,1906,4.630952380952381

Why? Because this disk works all of the angles of his tour, taking you back stage for soundchecks, on the bus/jet, in his hotel room, capturing radio and celebrity comments along with commentary with the band and crew. It also includes some of the stories he tells to set up the show and songs and more.

There is a bit too movement, cutting from one band member, to the audience and so forth, that the pace is too quick.  Also, an even bigger problem is the breaking away from the concert to see backstage footage, on the road footage, etc.  While these, unto themselves are entertaining and provide a nice glimpse into life on the road, they break up the flow of the concert.

What ruined it for me was all the jumpy camera work, constant scene editting, song truncations, backstage shots mixed in with song performances, etc, etc, etc.  And there was way too much focus on audience shots, it all just seemed too contrived and artificial. Which is was a real let-down, because I was really hoping for this DVD to be a simple film of  uninterupted concert songs in sequence so I could experience it as a souvenir of the show I saw.
No, it's not completely terrible. The sound is great, and the picture quality is clear and sharp. And of course the music is absolutely wonderful. But what else would you expect with Beatles music.
I just wanted to watch the band play songs in sequence without the constant interuptions and dizzying camera work. All the crowd scenes, backstage shots, etc, etc, would have been better featured on a bonus disk. Continually mixed in with the band's performance is distracting and ultimately annoying.

My only complaint is that not all the songs are played from start to finish, especially Hey Jude (Kinda brought back memories of when this song from his 1993 live special on FOX was not listened to its entirety by television viewers, because: 1. it went beyond the closing credits and 2. those in charge decided to not give any extension to the program whatsoever).
Nonetheless, it is a strong musical triumph, for even though it is twelve years later, it is by far the closest reproduction of my memories of his 1990 tour as he performed his classics from Let It Be to Back in the USSR. Tripping the Live Fantastic, the CD from then, and Get Back, its VHS equivalent, did not quite match up so far as doing justice to what attendees of any of of Sir Paul's performances enjoyed.",1042329600,,975,4.4525139664804465

I poured myself a glass of wine and kicked off the shoes and prepared... and was dissapointed.  First of all, the picture quality was not that good which is understandable because some of the photography is in the dark .  If this was the only problem, I could live with it but there were other detractor which in my mind were unwarrented which made this DVD a dissapointment.  They could have put in more footages of the concert instead of their activities in the zoo, backstage activities and shots of movie stars.  I bought the DVD to see the concert, not the other stuff.

And on the menus section the menus interfaces are confusing and some of them, like the ""Bonus Songs"" section are ""road end"" sections in which to get back to where you were you have to work your way out to the main menu and then try to find your way to were you were... sadly, but poor DVD menu interface.

Having been to a Beatles concert at D.C. Stadium in 1966, I have experienced the music in person.  This DVD may not have the superb Dolby sound that other concert videos have, but it's still a great improvement over the sound of a live performance.
I enjoyed the audience shots.  Had I been to the concert in person I would have spent all my time watching the stage.  I know what Paul McCartney looks like so I don't need to watch every movement of his lips for every song in the three hour video.  I enjoyed seeing the wide range of ages, emotions and interactions of those in the audience.  This was more than a concert...it was a trip back through time, and this DVD captures the generational transcendance of Paul McCartney and the music with which he is associated.
I would recommend it for any Beatles fan.  For those who discredit this video in comparison with those of other stars, we'll just wait to see if they're still packing the seats in 39 years....or perhaps the only thing they have going for them is a spiffy concert video.",1041552000,,1270,4.424892703862661

It was good to see what a caring, funny and talented performer he is. Contrary to what people say, we hear the songs in their entirety and there are so many he plays for us, just about everyone is a great one. He sounds as great today with his band as he did with the Beatles 40 yrs ago. And I didn't mind seeing the fans and their emotions at all. I would have been right there doing the same thing. This dvd is for people who love Paul and his music. I didn't see any flaws in the show at all. It's worth every penny!",1041552000,,672,3.948529411764706

Having seen the recent concert twice, I felt that the production mixing reduced some of the edge from the guitars and drums which we all felt during the live shows.  I recommend adjusting the bass levels up and using high end speakers if available to get the full feel.  However even with this being said - the mix is at the right level to listen to the disk repeatedly.
It does capture the fun of the touring adventure and Paul McCartney's excellent attitude and maturity having lived as a rock and roller for 40 years and still making it nothing but enjoyable.
Don't get the CD for the quality of the music, get it to experience some good honest enjoyable entertainment from an entertainer who loves putting on a show.",1041552000,,953,4.454022988505747

He had never performed ""Getting Better"" live before this tour.  I just got a DVD player and this was the first DVD I got (as a gift), so maybe I'm not so spoiled and whiny yet.  I liked the reveiwer who starts out ""I'm a huge fan of Paul"" and then spends paragraphs bashing him.  No, I think you'll see huge fans on this video.  I enjoyed seeing the people in the audience, which included many celebrities.  The man's a legend - a phenom.  What a songwriter!  That's one of the things I kept thinking while watching this.  I thought Paul sings better on this then I have seen him in recent years, like on SNL.  He certainly doesn't have the voice he used to, but does these songs here well enough to be enjoyed.  And quite a nifty little band too.  This DVD's a keeper.",1041465600,2,882,4.14792899408284
1800314,1,B00007149K,"I can only summize that this horrible waste of time and money was edited/directed by someone who watched too much MTV and is new to the business of editing concert films. (Could the director be a just-out-of-college friend of Heather's with a film degree in his pocket and no experience at making a concert film?)
Yes, we know you had a lot of cameras there, and this is a huge place with big screens hanging all around the stage. I thought the idea of a ""concert film"" was to see the show as if you had front row seats - I got so tired of the cuts to the VERY wide shots of the stage, that I nearly turned this thing off by the 3rd song. But there were so many other reasons to turn it off: the ""frantic"" editing, as if the viewer would become bored if the shot lingered on McCartney too long, so for no apparent reason we have to see a ""nothing"" shot of the bass player, or some audience member with a tear in their eye, or my personal favorite, the ever-overused split-screen! A well placed audience shot is a great thing - but I wanted to throw things at these people the cuts were so bothersome. If I want to look at audiences I will go to a show and face the opposite direction from the stage, not lay down $20 for a DVD.
I received this disc for Christmas, and caution every McCartney/Beatle fan to stay far away if only for the horrible production values. It may serve as a remembrance of the tour, I suppose, but the sound is nothing special either and multiple viewings are out of the question. The Blair Witch Project of concert films. No flow or grace, which is very sad, since the show had such visual interest that was totally missed in this package.
And to not have the option just to hear the music without the ""commentaries"" and ""cutsie sound bites"" is simply inexcusable in the age of DVD programability. For a guy who has all the money in the world, you would expect higher production values on a DVD.",1041292800,17,1920,4.277472527472527

In addition, Paul has completely come to terms with his past.  In addition to performing many Beatles songs, he dedicates ""Here Today"" to John Lennon, ""Something"" to George Harrison and ""My Love"" to Linda McCartney.  However, don't get the impression that the concerts are somber remembrances of past glories.  All of the songs, old and new, are performed with passion, vitality and a sense of fun.

Although there is some truth to some of the things he is saying in his review, some of the criticisms are just plain unfair.  Just about every concert video I have ever seen has included much footage of adoring fans.  Check out Springsteen, for example.  I have been following the concert circuit for many years and I think most of the top performers play the same songs over and over because these are the most requested songs.  I think that for every one person who complains about the repetitiveness of the songs, there are three more who spill tears of joy each time they hear these wonderful songs for all of the memories they bring back.  I don't know how this person can refer to himself as a Paul McCartney fan.  I recommend the DVD highly.

I was not disappointed . I have seen Paul , live , three times before ,  but was not able to see this tour . I now feel like I've experienced the concert and then some . The editing was very pleasing , typical of what I expect from this consummate professional .What I was most impressed with was the raw emotions invoked throughout the film .The footage of the incredibly diverse audience , so obviously stirred by each song , brought me back to my earliest concert memories . The choice of songs , all about love and positive reinforcement , was a great departure from most of the pathetic attempts at music found in todays music scene . Paul's energy , his new band , and his new relationship were truely inspiring  for this aging Beatle fan. Judging from the huge varieties of age groups , all singing along with every song , this would be a great dvd for anyone who appreciates real music . If your idea of music is an angry , no talent clown , talking quickly over stolen melodies , don't bother with this dvd . . . you won't get it . But, if you want to see a true musical genius , I recommend this highly . I am a photographer and was very impressed with the way this concert was shot , I wouldn't change a thing .

No. Nothing like that. Then I learned this is a TV special. Full of breaks. Songs cut off. Songs interrupted along their way. Bad lightning. The only thing you can have for sure is that Paul is still amazing.

1800342,1,B00007149K,"This would have to be the worst music DVD i have ever seen.
First i am a huge Paul McCartney fan & after he pulled the plug on his Australian tour i wanted to see what the US has been enjoying. The problem is that this DVD is so bad that it leaves you with the thought that Paul McCartney has got a serious ego problem & that he is so intoxicated with himself, it will make you throw up.
You may ask why?.Watching this DVD & you can see McCartney is the best Beatles tribute band around (certainley the most
expensive one),he is living off past glories & if you are a fan of his solo stuff you better look elsewhere.
The problem is with Paul's tours it does not matter if you miss a tour as he will perform the same songs tour after tour. Once again on this DVD we have Yesterday,Let it Be,The Long & Wind ing Road so on & so on. He even does the same songs in soundchecks that he has been doing since 1989.
As people have mentioned the DVD is poorly put together. The concert is not the full show,songs are edited (We can work it out,Something,My Love) & are out of sequence. The picture qaulity is bad VHS & is in Pan & Scan,the sound is also flat & does not have any clarity to it. In between songs you have footage of stupid fans who should know better,saying how much they love Paul YAWN!.Also spaced out in between songs we have Paul being Paul (which is laughing at his own jokes,making sure he has all his hangers on around so they laugh with him,this is so Elvis it is scary).As well as songs being edited some of the songs have talking through them or in Hey Jude's case come on around the second verse. When you do get a complete song the camera angles switch so fast it is hard to know what is going on. As well during songs you have alot of audience reaction shots so you get to see more people making fools of themselves GREAT!.
All in all this makes for a very bad concert film. Paul McCartney should know better or people around him should. There are plenty of concert DVD's around & many production companies to do them it is not that hard. It obviously was in this case.",1040688000,15,2088,4.145320197044335

1800363,4,B00007149K,"I saw the show at the Pond in Anaheim, CA. I am a musician since
the age of 5, I'm now 48 so I feel I can give a worthy review. First of all the show I saw literally had 0 mistakes in both the music and the vocals. Paul's voice was simply ""on"" that night. The sound was very full and powerful (thanks Abe) but still clean. When I first saw the TV version of this I was disapointed that they showed so much of the crowd, but after viewing it realized that Paul was trying to show the feeling of what it was like when Beatle mania was happening, as well as demonstrate the
fact that everyone from 5 to 60 new all the words and liked the
music. I'd say about 1/2 the songs on the DVD are great songs, I like the older one's and some of the wings stuff. I'm sorry Paul but I don't care for what you're doing now. The show I saw he did ""She's leaving home"" which was absolutely amazing sounding. That wasn't on the DVD. On ""We can work it out"" the keyboard player came down and played the acordian while paul played the acoustic, sounded amazing. On the DVD no acordian? I'm confused about the selections he used? Literally every song ""I"" saw them do was flawless. They should have used just the show I saw. On the DVD Pauls beautiful voice has some cracking on the highs which it didn't do at the Pond. Finally, one of the most irritating things about the DVD is that for the price of tickets, though well worth it I can't believe the format is ""Dolby Surround"" and not ""Digital Surround 5.1"" Even with all these observations just being a Beatle and McCartney fan as I am it's worth buying just to add to your Beatles collection.

I have been reading reviews of this DVD and it blows my mind that some people acutally thought they were going to get some sort of ""uncut"" full-length concert....IT WAS A TELEVISION SPECIAL!!  I thought that some of the backstage shots, rehearsal clips and other behind the scenes footage provided a entertaining and insightful look into the life of a living legend.  I was fortunate enough to see Paul perform in NYC, and I believe this DVD, in general, captured the tour as best as it could in 2 hours.  It provides for good memories, especially if you were lucky enough to see him live on this tour.
I did not give the DVD 5 stars because I do tend to agree with some of the reviews regarding some of the cheesy fan outtakes it shows...I do think the fans are an important part of a concert tour and should be represented, but the DVD does go a bit overboard with some over zealous fans declaring their love for Paul, singing songs to each other, etc.  This could have been toned down a bit...I guess you can't really blame them though, right??

I recommend it to fans because there are many great moments/songs from the tour that have been preserved.  Nevertheless, on the whole it was a huge disappointment.  I expected to get a close to 3 hour, entire uncut concert.  Instead I was dumbfounded to see that someone thought it might be more interesting to include a bunch of inane back stage scenes (better suited for a bonus disk or special features), celebrity sitings, and fan interviews interspersed with songs that are not presented in the order McCartney played them.  You really can't appreciate just how great this tour was from watching this video.
Other comments:  Video is grainy.  I also can't believe that unlike the CD, they did not include a book or any narrative info. on what is included on the DVD.  Last, but not least, I have had numerous technical problems with the DVD.  I returned the first one that I received and now am having problems with the 2nd one.  Unlike any other DVD I own (I own many), Chapters and a timer are not displayed on my DVD player, a Pioneer Elite.  My next problem is that the DVD skips back to the first title after playing ""Let Me Roll It"" about 2/3 of the way through.  The only way for me to see/hear the rest of the DVD is to go to Menu and click on ""Back In the USSR"", the next song after ""Let Me Roll It"".  Is anyone else experiencing this problem? (I have fewer problems if I play it on my PC..could it have something to do w/ the fact that it is a DVD-ROM..I am not a techie and would appreciate some help on this.)
The CD is much better.  It includes all 35 songs McCartney played during the 1st half of his tour (he substitued 3 for the 2nd half).  Nevertheless, there is a big BUT here too.  All of McCartney's song intros. were removed from the CD, so you can't hear him reminisce on John or tell how George loved to play the ukelele.

1800402,2,B00007149K,"It seems as if it would have been so simple. One of the greatest writers/performers of modern times performs at the top of his game with his best band since the legendary Beatles. A stunning array of glorious visuals suppliments the fantastic musical chemistry of the amazing new band. For a DVD producer/director, success would seem as simple as choosing a good camera and aiming it at the stage--allowing the magic of the man and the performance to tell its own story.
Unfortunately, the production of this DVD proves that sometimes the better simple options are not taken in a misguided effort to ""enhance"" what already was close to perfection. The sad result of this miscalculation is that the final product clutters and covers the original gem with so many layers of unnecessary fluff that one can barely recognize it. Almost every major production decision on this DVD was, sadly, the wrong one.
One can begin by mentioning that the filmstock used greatly darkens the once-gloriously bright stage lighting. There is a murkiness and gloominess to the visuals that certainly was not present in the original atmosphere of the concerts. In addition, the live show's outstanding multi-screened backdrop film effects (no doubt produced at great cost) are barely shown at all on the DVD, except in shots that are gone in the blink of an eye. If there was ever a live show that demanded full-stage camera angles, it was this one, but the directors/editors present the action at claustrophobically tight camera angles and seem deathly afraid of showing too many of the band members in one shot. This is especially disappointing when one realizes how well the band members played off each other--an aspect of the show the quick-cut edits leave on the cutting room floor.
All this may have been forgiven if the cameras were simply pointed in the right direction, but ""Back in the US"" would have been better titled ""Camera Crew's Backs to the Stage in the US."" For reasons that may never be fully comprehended, the filmmakers decided that consumers of Paul McCartney DVDs would not want to see too many shots of Paul and the incredible band but would rather glimpse an excessive number of no-name and big-name fans singing along to the show. The overuse of crowd reaction shots produces in the viewer the same sense of frustration that one often gets at a concert when one's sightline is continually blocked by other audience members. This is irritating enough on the first viewing, but downright annoying on a DVD that one hopes to view numerous times after the purchase. It is also very disappointing to note that the cameras almost always cut away from McCartney at the end of songs (missing many entertaining live moments such as his humorous reactions to the ""Live and Let Die"" explosions.) The inclusion of overly literal crowd shots is also rather juvenile filmmaking (a woman wipes a tear at the line ""holding back the tears no more,"" a woman makes a funny face during the line ""I can almost remember their funny faces,"" a man [yes, a man] closes his eyes on the line ""close your eyes and I'll kiss you."")
It is also evident that ""Back in the US"" was conceived with the idea that McCartney fans buy both the CD and DVD as the DVD features incomplete or talked-over versions of many of the songs. Instead of full songs, the viewer gets excessive backstage footage and even a bizarre Spinal Tap moment with the band and great apes. It is a tribute to McCartney and the band that this DVD works even as well as it does because of the timelessness of the music. Still, the viewer can't help praying for a ""Back in Japan"" digitally filmed full-length concert DVD in the future that does this amazing tour and performer a final measure of justice.",1039737600,3,3743,4.76
1800403,4,B00007149K,"I just finished up watching the DVD and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It is hard to believe that one man could write so many great songs in one lifetime, and at the age of 60 perform them so well.  His selection of songs were incredible (although I wish he would have begun with Venus and Mars rather that Hello Goodbye) this was a concert for the ages.  And while others who have written have said this was his last tour, I beg to differ.  If you listen to him talking during the video, you hear him talking about not retiring and loving what he does. When he does retire, he will go on one last big tour that will sell out big time.

For those who are looking for a straight concert, this might not be for you.  There is a lot of behind the scene stuff and  several songs are cut off. For those looking for a straight concert of Paul, get a copy of Rockshow from the 70's and you'll get what you want, minus a lot of fantastic songs.",1039651200,,941,4.026881720430108

However, this DVD and the associated CD for this concert is less than what I'd expect from someone of McCartney's stature.  The DVD is filled with video segments that must have been recorded on analog video cameras or really [bad] digital handicams, and the CD's sound quality on several songs is not nearly up to par with the concert's sound quality.  The Producers really [messed up] this one.  Sure, there are some really good video and audio qualities here and there, but McCartney and his fans deserved the better quality for the entire length of the recordings.  What a shame.

There should have been more of a live looking concert than the typical movie touch up .

1800406,4,B00007149K,"Macca's performance is top notch in this DVD of his tour of the United States. The songs and performances (particularly Getting Better, Live and Let Die, Band on the Run, Coming Up and Sgt. Pepper Reprise/The End)highlight this band as of one Macca's best. Despite the fact that this is patched together from a number of performances (pretty seamlessly I might add), the concert has a pretty good flow.
The pros--you get to see the band perform three songs during rehearsal (Midnight Special, San Francisco Bay, Good Rockin' Tonight)plus three bonus selections (including the marvelous Every Night)and the expected classics. There are a number of surprises (if you have seen Macca before and didn't catch him this time)including a beautiful tribute to John and George.
Although occasionally grainy (probably due to the low light or digital transfer, the picture quality is very good overall. The director manages to capture the mood of the performances and the audience. Some folks have complained about the audience shots--I believe the director was trying to recreate the experience of being at a concert where you watch the performer and (at least we did) check out the audience as well.
Without the concert footage you would have wondered why Paul's voice breaks up during his performance of The Long and Winding Road. Members of the audience are holding heart signs which make Paul tear up during the song. He gamely tries to perform it but it's quite a nice genuine, emotional moment. He also comments on it as well (albeit briefly).
The cons--I would have liked the option with the angle function to either watch the band (and Paul) the whole time or view it the way it was shot. Audience shots get a bit old after watching a concert special a couple of times. Yes, we know it's live. The DVD format should have allowed fans to access rehearsals, outtakes, etc. during the actual performances (basically the disc needed to be more interactive). Perhaps a section where Paul discusses how it feels to be performing many of his Beatles/Wings/solo classics that he's never played live before.
How could they cut off Hey Jude? In the concert DVD it begins in the middle of the song. It spoils the concert's momentum and, again, going outside the performance and venue does hurt the pacing. It's distracting and could have been an ""extra"" feature.
I also would have loved the additional tracks that Paul added to the second swing of his US tour; She's Leaving Home was performed beautifully by the band. Perhaps we could have seen the rehearsal for this track (and a couple of the other changes) since they probably hadn't been incorporated yet.
There was a very active camera crew at the show I added so, perhaps, the performances were being taped in addition to being shown on the monitors. Paul is in fine voice throughout although there are a couple of tracks where it's clear he's lost some of his upper register (but that's to be expected given his age, the amount of performances0. Really his voice has matured and has a bluesy edge that was only hinted at before.
All in all this would be a nice gift for fans of Paul and, as a momento of his performance, would be a nice addition to any Beatle/Macca fan's collection. It's flawed but those flaws don't detract from the best performances on the DVD.
I'd suggest picking up the 2 disc CD as well. The performances there are straight forward (and the DVD-Audio or SACD will probably have multichannel versions of these very same tracks with a year or two)and without the visual interruptions seen here.",1039305600,3,3560,4.809135399673735
1800407,4,B00007149K,"Well where to start this dvd is certainly alot better than the previous live films, and i did enjoy it but it should have been edited down and been part of the special features on perhaps a 2 disc set with disc 1 being the concert complete, which would have been nice for those people who live in countries where paul is not touring. Also the picture quality is poor for dvd probably due to the fact that they have tried to squeeze so much onto one disc. I hope that they put out a dvd of the full concert in the future, lets hope that if the George Harrison tribute concert is put out on dvd it is put out complete without cuts.",1039219200,,629,4.080645161290323

But I found this to expand the experience, not detract from it. Great sound quality and some really very special moments.
Only thing that I was surprised about is there were no liner notes contained in with the disk.",1039219200,,505,4.75
1800409,3,B00007149K,"Don't get me wrong, the 2002 DRIVING RAIN/BACK IN THE U.S. tour itself was fantastic.  Paul McCartney, one of rock and roll's true greats, broke records with his 2002 nation-wide tour.  Indeed, one wonders where Paul gets the energy to perform virtually nonstop for two and a half hours during each show.  Therefore, my review of this DVD is somewhat jaded by the fantastic experience of attending Paul's Philadelphia concert.

The DVD does not fully convey the spirit of the concert.  As a tour documentary intercut with live concert footage, it is a well edited film.  As a pure McCartney concert it somewhat misses the mark.  Unfortunately several of the musical numbers are cut short with the addition of tour commentary.  There are breaks between the numbers to interview crowds, show footage of the tour driving cross country, and other non-performance vignettes.

Some of the songs are not included in the main presentation and can only be found in the bonus material.  This DVD would probably have been better off as a pure -- unbroken --  concert DVD with a bonus disc highlighting the other aspects of the tour.  No doubt the editing of the DVD was designed to distinguish it from the companion CD of the same tour.

On the plus side for all those who viewed the ABC Television special BACK IN THE U.S., this DVD has double the material that was broadcast on national television.  If you are interested in the concert intercut with tour material, then I recommend that you add this DVD to your collection.  If you are looking forward to the concert material make sure you keep your finger on the forward arrow button on your DVD player's remote control following each musical number.",1039219200,2,1693,4.789655172413793
1800410,5,B00007149K,"I got to see the San Jose show on the second leg of this tour and it was probably the best show I've ever seen. Paul is singing and playing great! The band is, IMO, his best since the Beatles. I really enjoyed the drumming of Abe Laborial Jr (I don't think I am spelling his last name correctly). Lots of classic Beatles and Wings songs as well as newer songs. I am particularly fond of his Driving Rain CD and the concert includes the songs Driving Rain and Lonely Road.
I find it a bit strange that they choose to rearrange the song order on the DVD and they do not include all the songs. The other REAL pisser is that they decided to reward buyers of the DVD with a secret area on the Macca website which includes a few more songs and interviews. I really wish they would have just put it all on the DVD so I could see it at a bigger than 2x4"" size.

You don't start a song half way, or cut in the middle to show an interview, that's a sacrilege.  I pre-ordered this DVD thinking that it would be one of the most precious possessions of my collection.  I am sorry to say this, but if you could, I recommend taping the show from TV and buy the CD instead.  It presents all the songs without interruptions.
I was extremely disappointed.  I own quite a few concert DVD's and this has to be one of the worst.  For starters, the image quality looks like poor quality cable.  The sound is nothing extraordinary...sorry but I have heard better.  The DTS soundtrack is a nice surprise, but I would have traded it for a nice widescreen anamorphic image.  To tell you the truth that was one of my two biggest disappointments.  Concert DVD's should all be in WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC format. THERE IS NO EXCUSE. Diana Krall's - Live in Paris, Yes - Live in Amsterdam, Roger Waters - In the Flesh Live, David Gilmour - In Concert, Sting - All This Time, Neil Finn & Friends - Seven Worlds Collide, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - Live in New York City, etc, etc, etc........are all WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC.  Even Paul McCartney's - Live at the Cavern Club was also in widescreen anamorphic, why not Back in the US ?  The Cavern Club concert footage is short, but fantastic and worth every penny.
Its sad, very sad, because the music is beyond words and the performance its extraordinary.

McCartney's voice is studio quality.  The instrumentation was simple and very true to the original recordings.
I do not know why the listings do not indicate it, but it DOES include both Dolby 5.1 AND DTS soundtracks.  Both make you feel like you are sitting near the fron row with crowd noise and light echo coming from the surround speakers.  Personally, I always prefer DTS, which has a more subtle quality than Dolby 5.1.
The video does a great job of capturing how magical and special the experience was for the audience and shows the band well.  The increcible stage with the constantly changing, but not distracting video images is well shown.
If there is a flaw, it is that it is not a straight video of the concert itself.  The songs are interspersed with brief comments and interviews.  These comments do help you appreciate the excitment of the audience, but interrupt the flow of the concert, which from a theatrical point of view was excellent.  AS with othe concert videos, I would appreciate an option to play it ""music only"" or ""with interviews.""

And if it's a CONCERT film, then I don't need to see the backstage patter, the tour bus chatter, the communing with the apes.  Show me the concert!  Considering that the Special Features on this DVD include soundcheck performances and backstage stuff, none of that should've been part of the concert film.
And what's the point of some songs -- Hey Jude, most notably for me -- not even being shown in their entirety?  If you want the audience to share the concert-going experience, this ain't the way to do it.
Finally, because of the choppy nature of the film, it didn't even close to recreating for me the emotions of being there in person.  Not even close.

Where other world class performers such as Springsteen or Waters make definitive usage of the DVD medium (widescreen footage, optimized sound), McCartney still does concert videos like in the old VHS days.
Really a shame since this was a first class tour and might not come along again.  If you've been to his shows this DVD will only give you a glimpse of how it really was.
If it's one thing that's now looming on me it's that McCartney is not really interested in capturing a concert experience to its fullest, he is obviously too obsessed with himself.

The set list is fabulous, the behind-the-scenes stuff is excellent. But what makes this DVD so special is the interplay between a marvelous artist and an audience that adores him and his music. Paul McCartney may be 60 or so, but his voice and energy and humor are those of his younger self. Most of the songs are from the Beatles era, and the rest from the best-known Wings periods. He sings and plays them faithfully, and with gusto. But the audience is almost as much fun to watch.

Ringo's new All-Starr concert DVD has MUCH higher quality video, and also doesn't have the MTV short attention span edits all through it. I actually had a headache after watching this! That is the same bad editing style that Paul's last two concert tour films used (""Get Back"" & ""Paul Is Live"") that make them very annoying too, and almost unwatchable. The behind the scenes stuff and excess fan clips should be included as extras, they detract from the show, interupt the flow, and make the feature less watchable after multiple viewings. Who wants to see that stuff more than once or twice, and certainly not in between and over top most every song (they didn't learn from Black Sabbath's ""Last Supper"" butcher job). In a different way, the same complaint I had with Ringo's DVD--just show the WHOLE concert, in the right order, that's what makes a good concert video--goes here too.
The sound is OK, should have been better when other artists release better than this (in addition to previous mentions, I would add Fleetwood Mac ""The Dance"" as another audio benchmark comparison).
The extras, that were included, are nice. The sound check performances are more fun than the feature really. They would have made a killer extra grouped together, and should not have been mixed partly into the concert portion of video. There is nothing on this whole DVD that beats the version of ""Matchbox"" from the sound check. As for the ""bonus Secret Web Site"", what a worthless waste. Some techno-geek's ""brilliant idea"" of the day. Everything that is on that site should have, and could have, been on this DVD. They did it because they could, but I don't care to watch videos over the internet instead of on DVD. And even if you did prefer watching that stuff on your computer, one year, two years, five years from now, you think that content will still be there? It would be there, if it was on the disc where it belongs.

That is why this DVD is a little disappointing - it isn't the concert!  Oh, it does represent the highlights of the concert, but it is presented out of order (for reasons that escape me), and with a number of songs left out (more on that in a little bit).  Worst of all, there are interviews with fans and stage crew which often ""step on"" the songs - and many of the very same interviews are repeated in the ""Special Features"" section!  And why is ""I Saw Her Standing There"" played only at the end with credits rolling over it?
Of the songs left out were some very good tunes, including ""Mother Nature's Son"" and ""Lonely Road"" - both can be viewd with Windows Media Player on th ""Secret Web Site"" - but that's hardly the same as including them on the DVD.  Furthermore, the rendition of ""The Long and Winding Road"" features Paul's voice cracking with emotion as his road crew offers a tribute to him - that's nice, but I'd have preferred to have heard a more flawless rendition while offering this emotion-charged version as a part of the ""Special Features"".
This was a DVD, for crying out loud!  Even if it had required a second disc, the fans deserve the entire concert, start-to-finish, in the order he performed, and unblemished by voice-overs of fans and crew.

What DOES bother me is the video quality - it looks like grainy VHS - I would rate much of it lower than VHS quality.  This has to have been a conscious decision (there are obviously some interview spots where this was done intentionally) - but why do it during the concert footage?  I understand that film looks ""richer"" than video (i.e. - the quality difference between a movie and a typical three-camera sitcom is enormous) - but richness is not the same as graininenss - I don't know if they shot this in video and then applied some sort of ""fim effect"" or what, but the result is not good.
The sound is OK - certainly not the best DTS mix I've ever heard in terms of its use of the rear channels.",1038700800,,1262,4.541850220264317

1800472,2,B00007149K,"I was lucky enough to see McCartney live in May on the first part of Back In The U.S. tour, and I can tell you it is the best concert I have even seen. When I heard that there was going to be a DVD of this tour I could hardly wait for it to come out. Now that its out I wish I had kept my money. The DVD was of poor quality and for the 5.1 surround sound it was very bad. They had voice overs in most of the songs, and when I listen to music I want to hear just the music, no voice overs. If you went to see the concert just savory the memories and don't buy the DVD you will be disappointed.",1038614400,5,592,3.5968992248062017
1800473,5,B00007149K,"Last January, as I was watched the halftime segment of the Super Bowl, I nearly cried.  There was my near life-long hero, joining an out of key Terry Bradshaw for a rendition of Love Me Do.  At that moment, I saw McCartney as an over the hill, egomanical opportunist.  I honestly believed, at that time, that he used 9-11 as his own promotional tool.
Well, hell, McCartney has always been unabashedly self-promoting.  But at his age, I guess it just didn't go down quite as easily.  Thank God, this DVD nearly erases that Super Bowl blunder.  McCartney is sincere, energetic and puts on a hell of a show.  He's made some good and bad decisions in his career; getting some younger guys for Driving Rain and this tour was definitely a good decision.  These guys give him a badly needed adreniline shot, as their energy is contagious.  None more so than drummer Abe, a rather large young black man.  While subtlety is not his forte, and is missed a few times, he bashes the drums with an abandon I've not seen since Keith Moon.  The two young guitarists add to the inspired mayhem, and it's a good thing we've got good old Wix Wickham to hold everything together.
This DVD is a must have if you're a McCartney fan.  These are energized versions of mostly very old Macca songs, and you'll just love the electricity the band, and the old man, create onstage.
The sound itself is a bit of a bummer.  Producer David Kahne obviously wanted to capture the energy that was happening onstage, but he does it at the expense of any real detail.  You feel like you are in the arena, kind of lost in that big sound.  I guess that's a good thing, but sometimes individual sounds are all but lost in that big sound.
On this tour, Macca makes up for his aging voice with pure energy and will.  Again, the subtlety and suppleness of his young voice is gone, but he sings his heart out, and God love him for it.
Enough said.  Buy this; it's a special concert with a kickass band.",1038528000,2,1959,4.412256267409471

  After having seen him numerous times in concert from 1976 on (but not this tour), I have to admit that at age 59, his voice is sounding better than it has in years, with much more nuance, higher highs and lower lows. Maybe that's what new love can do to you.

I felt that this should have been a two disc package with a good 4 hours of material.  I wasn't bored for one minute during the 3 hour concert and I wouldn't be bored with a four hour DVD.  One disc should have contained 3 hours of mostly concert footage showing every song (about 40) played throughout the two leg tour. It would have been great to catch the magic of one song from each city played on the tour(up to the DVD deadline).  This DVD seemed to concentrate on a few cities and a few too many audience celebrities.  A second disc should then contain all the extra footage which is also very interesting. I would have gladly paid an extra...for a two disc set with a nice informational booklet and a better case.

DTS surround is very nice. Seems like all the big hits are included. Now for my problems. The video is filmed, not shot with High Def cameras. So the picture is not what it could have been. It is not widescreen either. Since in a few years everyone will have HD widescreen, it would have been nice to preserve such a timeless concert as this in that format. What annoys me the most is that there is too much focus on the crowd. I hate it. I don't want to see the crowd singing, reacting, etc, to everything. A few shots here and there is ok...but there is way too much. I want to see Paul...that's it. All concerts should be like the James Taylor DVD. Music first.",1038441600,,839,4.217391304347826
1800498,3,B00007149K,"Without question, Paul McCartney's 2002 tour may have been his best post-Beatles performances. His voice was far stronger than his 1990 and 1993 tours, and his young band really made McCartney work harder than he'd done in decades. While not as many surprises in the set list as before, those selected made for a well-paced exciting show.
But, this DVD isn't quite as good of a souvenir as those of us who attended the shows would've liked. First off, it might be THE most fawning video of a performer. An artist of his stature hardly needs the gushing validation that this offers, plus all the superstar accolades. And all this fawning takes up time away from the music. Only about 29 of the 35 songs played on the tour are performed in the concert film (another three are in the bonus section), and not all the songs are performed complete. Sadly, his sweet tribute to George Harrison, ""Something"" is trimmed by a whole verse. Surely we could have cut out one more shot of a middle aged soccer mom screaming ""PAUL!""......... to find room for this lovely song complete. Finally, the songs aren't in the order they were played, which is likewise disappointing as it was the pace of the show that was part of its success.
As for the disc quality, the authoring of this is really sad, almost like it was done on a home computer. The same footage appeared in the ABC-TV special in far better quality, so this is just a mediocre DVD master. The disc's authors have also put the scene/track selections in the ""Special Features"" section (not exactly where I'd look for them), but you can quick access your favorite song.
But on the plus side - it sounds fantastic. The performances chosen from the tour footage are outstanding, both McCartney and band are in terrific form. The bonus materials (soundchecks, backstage, etc.) are generous and will make McCartney fans happy.
So...a mixed review. But all the details aside - it IS a great show that I know I'll enjoy often.",1038441600,17,1965,4.665706051873199

The sound and video quality of this DVD are on par with old VHS -- video full of noise and color bleed, sound is flat and strident.  I was at the Philly concert and can honestly call it one of the top 3 concert experiences of my life.  Paul was mesmerizing.  That's what made it so painful to see the concert reduced to B movie quality on this DVD.  Paul, please watch Bruce Springsteen's ""Live in NYC"" DVD to see how beautifully a concert DVD can be done.  Also see Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Sense"" and ""The Who -- Live at the Royal Albert Hall.""  These are examples of great video, audio, and editing.  Paul deserved better treatment.  The rapid cuts and being pulled out of the concert between every song for behind the scenes really defeated any sense of ""being there.""

1800500,5,B00007149K,"This film puts you front row center with one of the immortals, Paul McCartney:  The Beatle; the icon; and the man.  And, of course, there's the music.  ""Paul McCartney-- Back In the U.S,"" is much more than ""just"" the music, however; it's an experience, and one you can now live over and over again thanks to the magic of DVD/video.
The cameras follow Paul and his band on this 2002 tour of the U.S., from New York to Los Angeles (where as they pan the audience you get glimpses of such luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, John Cusack and Steve Buscemi, among others) and a number of stops at cities and venues along the way as they crisscross the country.  The music is great, Paul looks and sounds good, and you also get some insights into how it all came together and what it's like on the other side of the curtain, through brief interviews and/or comments from Paul, members of his band and others who work so hard behind the scenes to make it all happen (and to give you an idea of the magnitude of their endeavors, it took twelve semi-trucks to haul equipment and sets from one place to the next).
But what really makes this film engrossing is what the eye of the camera captures as it sweeps the audience, which makes it quite evident that this is not just another concert, but history in the making and being revisited, playing out and documented here for posterity, and clearly transcending show business in general and the music business in particular.  There are old and young alike in attendance, exhibiting every possible emotion; some through totally uninhibited revelry, others more introspective-- internalizing the moment though every bit as exuberant as those who express themselves openly.  And there are some genuinely profound moments captured here, as you can clearly see in the eyes of especially the more ""mature"" members of the crowd, that McCartney's music is taking them on a tour of their entire lives, creating a personal retrospective for each individual through songs that for them evoke a particular place at a specific time.  It's a spontaneous revisiting of good times and bad, as evidenced by the joy, laughter, tears, and for many by the distant, transported look of the eyes, a glassy expression signifying the timelessness, not only of the music, but of the experience itself.
There are those among us who, adopting a most erudite countenance, will dismiss out-of-hand the notion that four mop-haired rock n' rollers from Liverpool changed the world as we know it, but such a stance is nothing less than an unmistakably self-serving denial of the incontrovertible facts of the matter.  Directly or indirectly, in one way or another, the Beatles touched the lives of everyone and will continue to do so as each generation discovers them anew in their own way and time, and Paul McCartney is decidedly a part of it still.  The music and the influence of McCartney and his mates is forever, and skeptics who stubbornly cling to their life rafts of refusal need look no further than ""Paul McCartney-- Back In the U.S.""  for the proof.  And acquiescence will be humbly accepted at the door.",1038441600,10,3134,4.785185185185185

This DVD concert was too short, too choppy and the editing wasn't very good. Advertised as covering 34 venues was a lie. It only covered the 1st leg of the tour and should of been called ""Driving USA"" instead of ""Back In The US."" There wasn't anything from the 2nd leg on this DVD. The best song, ""She's Leaving Home"" and others weren't included. But, we were treated to footage of movie stars and big bouncey breasted women. ""More Paul, less boobs.""
To be fair, the picture and sound quality was quite good. If the DVD covered the whole concert start to finish without all of the interuptions with peoples thoughts and leaving all of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff for a 2nd disc it would of been a much better momento of my concert experience. We all would of waited to get a better two disc set at a later time. This one was just thrown together.

1800544,4,B00007149K,"The concert was great and it would have been a great DVD if the concert was shown start to finish uninterrupted. That's not the case. Some songs are out of sequence and they are interrupted by Back stage comments by the band, crew and fans, and Paul appearing in radio and TV. Some of the time the talk even overlaps the performances. It would have been better if the interviews and behind the scenes stuff was all in the ""extras"" category allowing the concert to go ahead uninterrupted. This would be especially nice on repeat viewing. Instead three of the songs are placed in the extras area along with more behind the scenes stuff. There is also access to a secret web site for more stuff.
At times the editing is fast and choppy, as if the director felt he needed to ad to the excitement. The Cavern show DVD is much easier to watch. Directors of concert films should look at the Eagles' ""Hell Freezes Over"" or Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Since"". Let the performers create the excitement. The Sound quality is fairly good considering that it was recorded in large halls. There are thirty plus songs many Beatle favorites. Unfortunately it was all done on the first leg of the tour, as more Beatles were added for the second leg.

All in all it's a great souvenir for those who got to see the show live, and for those who didn't it shows what the fuss was all about. I would still buy it even with the flaws. Paul Rocks.

Spanning nearly forty years of timeless hits and presenting them in a way that is as fresh and vibrant as the day Paul and the boys first entered our collective conciousness via the Ed Sullivan show, McCartney reaffirms his status as a truly legendary performer.
I purchased the DVD at 12:01AM the day it was released.  I took it home and watched it immediately.  I was blown away with emotion and nostalgia, just as I was when I saw him live, three times, on the ""Back in the USA"" tour.  The energy that he and his extremely talented band radiate is a refreshing change from the morose and angst-ridden fare that the majority of today's artist exibit.
If you are a fan of the Beatles, Wings or solo McCartney, you cannot be without this priceless collection.  It is a true musical treasure chest with some very interesting and revealing insights into the life of this rock icon.

Give us a DVD that captures a live performance without all the gab and comments between songs.  Or at least make the DVD have an option so you can just watch the concert footage like they did on the Concert for New York.  At least a DVD player allows you to advance through the BS quickly.

The sound check cuts are fun and loose and you can really see the comraderie that the band has.  A comparison to the 1989 tour is inevitable and this tour was much better.  The band rocks hard!  The drummer, Abe, in particular is phemonenal. Paul is in great voice and his bass playing is superb.  Brian and Rusty add great energy and rockin' licks to the mix.  Wix provides great support on the keys and accordion.  No complaints!  I only wish we could have some cuts from the second leg of the tour.

First of all the stage is too dark. Good DVDs bathe the stage in lots and lots of light. Hard to see the performers the way the stage is lit. Second, much of it is grainy, as if the director was going for an arty effect. And what is with the constant cuts, in performances, to adoring fans? Yes we love the music but really, Paul and the band should be the show - not the adoring fans. A little bit is fine but shots of the fans seem to make up an awful lot of the show, and they keep popping up when the main focus should be the music and the band. I thought I was watching a fan club function. And why the recurring shots from the back of the hall? A DVD with recurring shots of the TV screens behind the performers? And the close ups of the players are rarely true close-ups. Didn't they have any hand held camera operators? It looks like all of the close ups are zooms from the back or sides of the hall.
For great DVD concerts, well lit, check out the Rolling Stones Bridges to Babylon, the All Star Tribute to Brian Wilson, Roger Waters in the Flesh Live, or Elton John One Night Only. These are fine examples of how it should be done.
The whole thing looks like a partial upgrade from a home movie.
The music though .... the music rates 5 stars. I love this music.
However, the purpose of a DVD is to bring the sights and the music to you at home. It fails miserably on the ""bring the sights"" part of the equation, unless your primary interest is constant shots of fans.

  Update:11/27/2002, Now that I have viewed this Dvd for the first time, I must say this just might possibly be the best Rock/concert film released this year.  The concert footage sends chills down ones spine as Paul and his band play flawless interpretations of both his Beatle and solo material.  The interaction and response of the audience makes you feel as if you were there.  One can also sense an emotional and loving respect that the audience has for this legend and in someways felt his grief when he sang ""Something"" in honor of George Harrison while playing a ukulele that George gave him as a gift.  His hit ""My Love"" was obviously sang with Linda in mind.  Paul has assembled a band that is without question one of his best ever.  Drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. is a standout here and is something to see.  I would also recommend the companion cd as well.  If you are a Beatle fan or McCartney fan or just like great music, I would advise you to pick up this Paul McCartney concert Dvd and enjoy an evening of fun and music from the man who wrote the soundtrack to many of our lives.",1038182400,6,1380,4.397637795275591

Then, as if that wasn't enough, right as he goes into the big yell before the instrumental part, he leaned back on his left leg and looked me right in the eye as he screamed.  Yes, you could say that pretty much did me in.  He could have just stood there and smiled for all I cared.  Waiting from the time I was 11 years old to see him and to actually be about 15 feet from him was an experience I will never forget.  He was as gracious and nice as he was musically wonderful.

1800576,5,B00007149K,"I saw Paul twice in the last 8 months.  The first time at his Driving Rain concert, was magic!  When he announced the second leg of his tour, I flew out to Cleveland and missed school for the concert.  This concert is absolutey AMAZING!!!  Although I can't be exactly sure what the DVD is like, because I don't know what city its in, and I don't know how they edited it.  If its anything like the concert I went to, its 2.5 non stop hours of 36 great Beatles, Wings, and McCartney songs.  If you can't be there live, and assuming this may be his last tour, you won't want to pass this one up!",1037059200,4,592,4.104347826086957
1800577,5,B00007149K,"After seeing Paul McCartney's Tours for Flowers in the Dirt and Off the Ground, I'll say his voice for this tour was the best I've ever heard.  Listen to ""Get Back"" & ""Paul is Live"" then listen to this. The songs, stage show,overall effects, the band and his voice haven't been this good since the Wings ""RockShow"" video. Every minute was full of an energy and enthusiasm I thought was lost long ago. If you have a home theater system set it for stadium or arena and crank it!!!",1036454400,7,478,4.370786516853933
1800578,5,B00007149K,"I had the pleasure of seeing Paul on the opening night of the Back in the US tour in Milwaukee and I have never seen or heard anything like it.  In the 3 hours he played, he NEVER took a break!  His bandmates did, but not him!  This guy's 60 right?  This DVD is definately a must for all Beatle and so-so Beatle fans.  If you have teenagers, this is a DVD you have to get them to watch.  Then they'll know what a real musician is and how great music sounds, instead of the boy groups crowding the airwaves.  After watching, I have no doubt they raid your old Beatle albums!",1036454400,11,573,4.0625
1800579,2,B00007149K,"This was the best concert I have ever attended. Unfortunately, the DVD didn't come close to the concert. The picture quality and sound quality were both mediocre at best. I suggest saving your money until they put out a better quality product.",1036368000,,243,4.809523809523809
1800580,5,B00007149K,"Paul McCartney is awesome!  His before concert theatrical presentation harkens back to the days of the Beatles, and his gentle, everyman approach gives the audience a feeling of really knowing him as he talks with you between songs, joking, laughing, telling stories about being on the road, and generally cutting up like he did in the early days.
All of the approximately 35 songs are out of this world - the sound is fantastic, and the band is ""right-on"" with McCartney's Beatles' sound.  It is hard to believe that five people produce such a full, smooth, rocking sound!
I loved this show so much that I went twice - once in Atlanta - May 13th, and again in New Orleans - October 12th.  It was truly the good feeling show of the year! Keep on truckin' Paul!",1036108800,2,760,4.532846715328467

7973927,5,B00007149K,I wish I could have attended one of his shows. They looked like a lot of fun. I mentioned to my co-workers that I was there at the 1966 show in Candlestick Park and they started bowing to me. Strange. Kids today are so deprived. All they get is illuminatii rap. George called it Crap.,1507334400,,284,4.181818181818182

7973930,5,B00007149K,"This video is good for a few reasons:
1) Reasonable price.
2) He is 17 years younger in this video than in present time. We never expect our music heroes to age, but they do.
3) Covers a whole bunch of his hits.

There's a good deal of back stage ad libs and impromptu scenes between the songs. It was better than what I expected from reading the reviews.",1495843200,,355,4.144927536231884
