3135665,4,B0014VPFUY,"We love Pocoyo at my house. My 1 and 3 year old fell in love with the characters and episodes, so we got the DVD to play in the car on long trips. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I wish the episodes were longer than 7-8 minutes. I get tired of the intro and ending music after so long....it comes so often. I love the characters! ...and my kids do, too!",1361664000,,356,3.76
3135666,5,B0014VPFUY,I bought for my 4 year old son.he loves out and starts laughing everyone he sees it. It's a very interesting cartoon.,1355356800,,117,4.363636363636363

3135668,3,B0014VPFUY,"I personally love Pocoyo, I think he and his friends are some of the cutest characters I have ever seen. This video is adorable and charming, and the images are age-appropriate for my almost-one-year-old. However, my baby was bored stiff by the videos. I'm hoping she gets into it as she gets older when she can understand the words, so for now it's going on the shelf. Sorry Pocoyo, see you later!",1335312000,,398,4.541666666666667
3135669,5,B0014VPFUY,"My kids do not seem to get bored of watching these episodes over and over...very amusing, toddler-friendly, and memorable...overall very good choice.",1329264000,,149,5.818181818181818

3135671,5,B0014VPFUY,We just discovered this on Netflix watch instantly and my 4 month old screams she laughs so hard watching this! They are only 7 minutes long so it is the perfect amount of time to hold her attention. (and for some reason I can't take my eyes off of it either!),1321401600,,260,4.117647058823529
3135672,5,B0014VPFUY,This particular dvd is the 3rd one that I have purchased for my son. He is 2 and a half and absolutley loves these little cartoons. The skits are so cute and include a little lesson for Pocoyo to learn. Each skit is very simple with a white background and minimal props to tell the story. This show keeps my sons attention better than most. I highly recommend this for any toddler.,1319241600,,381,4.305555555555555
3135673,5,B0014VPFUY,"This video only has 7 Stories: The Big Sneeze, Drum Roll Please, Umbrella Umbrella, A Mystery Most Puzzling, Double Bubble, Sleepy Bird's Surprise, and Swept Away. The quality of the video is excellent. I ordered from importcds and it arrived on time and in new like condition. Completely satisfied!!",1317340800,3,300,5.142857142857143
3135674,5,B0014VPFUY,I got this for my youngest who enjoys watching Pocoyo.  Its a cute cartoon.  My favorite is Pato and Ellie.,1316736000,,107,4.3
3135675,4,B0014VPFUY,"I have introduced Pocoyo to my baby when he was around 5 months old. Now that he is going 15 months in June 30, 2011, he could watch and understand cartoons much better, all he's ever wanted is Pocoyo. Nothing seems to get his interests much, except Pocoyo. He can sit and watch Pocoyo the entire dvd in contrast to Mickey Mouse dvd. Good investment when parents like me get to take a quick break.",1309046400,,397,4.306666666666667
3135676,5,B0014VPFUY,"This is the only Pocoyo DVD I've been able to find where they offer a language option of Spanish! Which means, we paid less than $10 for a Spanish-language version of Pocoyo rather than the $40 price for an official Spanish-language version of Pocoyo. The main narrator's voice is different but our toddler enjoys it just the same.",1308182400,4,331,4.724137931034483
3135677,2,B0014VPFUY,Well i bought this DVD thinking my girls were going to like it because they loved seeing it on the tv. Well when i got and played it they got bored really fast and annoyed. would have returned it if my 3 year old didn't break the case. i wasted $10.,1307059200,,249,3.9019607843137254
3135678,5,B0014VPFUY,listen to it in english or spanish. my little girl loves it. She burts out in laughter in certain parts,1302825600,,103,4.2
3135679,5,B0014VPFUY,If you haven't watched this videos and have a little one in the house... what are you waiting for?  watch some videos on you tube and you will be hooked. My son started watching pocoyo when he was 1 and at 4 years old he still loves it. Mommy and Daddy love it too. :),1298419200,,268,3.8727272727272726
3135680,3,B0014VPFUY,"Bummer! We fell in love with Pocoyo in Spain, where my husband is from and where Pocoyo was created. My toddler son loves watching Pocoyo clips on Youtube and we wanted a full-length DVD for him to watch to reinforce his Spanish language. Really bummed to discover that this is dubbed for a Latin American audience, so both the voices and much of the vocabulary differ from what we are used to (e.g. the call the radio ""el radio,"" which is totally incorrect in Spain -- should be ""la radio."")

Disappointed, since the main reason we bought the DVD was for my son to practice his language, accent, and listening skills in Spanish.",1297468800,7,629,4.566371681415929
3135681,5,B0014VPFUY,"The show is absolutely wonderful. The stories entertaining and very imaginative. What I love is how amazing the animation is and how non-verbally expressive each character is. There is also a deliberate sparseness to the background visuals, allowing the child to focus just on the characters.",1297036800,,292,5.369565217391305
3135682,4,B0014VPFUY,"I wish these videos would have more than 7 episodes on them, since each episode is only 7-8 minutes long. But the production is well done and much better than watching them online!",1294099200,,180,4.484848484848484

3135685,5,B0014VPFUY,"This movie is obviously good because my kid won't put it down. He picked up on the series probably through PBS Kids (or maybe it was online, who knows?) and it became an obsession (he has autism, you just never know when something is going to ""click"" with him). Let's say he went ballistic when the DVD arrived.",1281398400,4,311,4.379310344827586

3135687,5,B0014VPFUY,"This show is colorful and easy to follow for small children.  The lessons are simple and an example of good values which is rare these days on television with all of the mindless, worthless cartoons out there.  My son loves it and laughs with the characters, I feel good because he is also getting a good lesson!  I have recommended this to all of my friends with young children.",1271894400,,379,4.463768115942029
3135688,5,B0014VPFUY,"Our 2 year old son fell in love with Pocoyo when we stumbled upon a clip of it at the end of another DVD.  He sat and chuckled through the whole clip.  I ordered this DVD and he's been chuckling ever since.  I like that there are not ""scarey"" scenes and the background is very simple so he can follow the story line very well.  We now have severeal Pocoyo video's and books and they have helped to teach shapes, color, emotions and etc.  The music is cute in it too.",1265846400,,466,4.076923076923077
3135689,5,B0014VPFUY,"This dvd is composed of various short stories about a charming little boy and his friends. Some questions are asked during the story that allow kids to interact, kids voices answers the questions and our little one loves to join them and repeat -she is only 18 month old- she really likes the various characters and the fact that the stories are short is good point for parents you can allowed your kid to watch a few episodes without having her glue to the TV for more than 15 minutes. I like to watch it too so it's really fun to both clap, sing and interact with Pocoyo and his friends.",1261872000,,589,4.315315315315315
