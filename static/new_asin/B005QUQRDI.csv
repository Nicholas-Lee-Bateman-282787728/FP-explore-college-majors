4860038,1,B005QUQRDI,"This movie literally blew. I'm from Long Island ... I'm a Filmmaker ... and have a PHD in Sociology. I'm very well aqauinted with the legend of the Amityville Horror (as it is a part of my youth and local urban legend). This movie does the myth, legend and overall image of the Amityville Story an awful injustice. They show the actual house in the first frame of the movie and continue to shoot the film in a totally different home.

This is obviously a case of an amateur filmmaker, who went out and bought an expensive camera, and was so inspired by Paranormal Activity, that he wanted to produce Paranormal Activity Meets The Amityville Horror.

Predictable and Done much better by the films that came before it. A Carbon copy of a familiar script with an unsuccessful new twist.

This movie is the epitome of the crap that horror glorifies today. Terrible. Sorry I wasted my money on it.",1324944000,3,892,4.5625
4860039,3,B005QUQRDI,"By no means AMAZING, but I thought it was still a fun late night movie.  I'm a fan of the found footage genre, so if you arent, it's not for you.

Negatives -  The dad's acting is horrible, I actually thought it was a joke at points.  He has a moment at the end that was straight out of an saturday night live sketch.  The kid taping it is pretty bad too, but he's young and probably doesn't have a ton of experience.

Positives - while the first half is pretty boring, the last 20 minutes or so made this worth the rental for me.  The main ghost guy doesn't really make an appearance till the end, but he was really scary.  Would have liked to see more of that throughout the movie.  Some cool effects for being a low budget.

All in all, I enjoyed it and got a little creeped out watching it at 2am, but its nothing to write home about.",1324339200,4,838,4.054878048780488
4860040,1,B005QUQRDI,"The Amityville Haunting is another sad attempt to bring this franchise back to life.

This rendition of the famed New York haunted house where in 1974, 23-year-old Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family and then made famous again in 1975 by the Lutz story which was turned into the original ""Amityville Horror"" in 1979. Now this time around, the movie is shot entirely in POV style and of the ""found foot-age"" genre that has been a growing trend in the realm of horror films.

The movie starts out with a group of teenagers, doing what teenagers do best with empty and somewhat abandoned homes with beds: breaking in. Three of the four know the story and reputation of the house and as the movie opens one of the boys of the group lays down the story of what has supposedly gone on in the house.

As the teens stand in the front of the entrance their camera picks a partial silhouette at the top of the stairs that goes unnoticed except for one, but by the time everyone looks it's gone.

The camera cuts and when it comes back we find that the teens have spit up. One pair is of course in the upstairs bathroom videoing themselves having sex while the other pair is in the kitchen.

As the camera videos the couple in the bathroom the camera starts to blur and cut out (a trick that will be WAY OVER USED through-out the movie whenever the ghosts appear)only to just capture as the boy is yanked out the door, blood spraying on the wall as the girl screams. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the other couple in the kitchen of what is taking place to their friends, we cut back to the kitchen as the couple is making out. The camera shows the girl look behind her boyfriend, and as a look of shock comes across her face the cuts to black with screams.

We next open on the house as the Benson family meets the realtor in charge of the property. The son, Tyler, who is making a documentary of his family, films them going through the home. (Immediately fans of the previous films can see that this isn't the house or even the same style of home used before. Where the original kind of sat away from the road and neighbors this one your basic, run-of-the-mill suburban home) Here we find out that the Benson family is on hard times financially and emotionally. The father, Doug, is an ex-marine sergeant and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who has some issues with civilian life as he treats his family like they were serving in the corps. The mother is your basic doughy-eyed woman who most of the time seems to be on a valium cocktail, but she does pose reservations to moving into their new home. But the father is adamant on living there since it has the right number of bedrooms and he's tired of moving his family place to place because (we later find out is eight times in fifteen months) because of the older daughter's discipline problems that are, unfortunately, never truly addressed.

As the Benson tours the house with their realtor Tyler's camera starts with that annoying cutting out because a ghostly presence that we can only really here as voices seem to float up from the vent when he is left on his own for a while.

The realtor leaves the Benson's alone to discuss what they want to do, and goes outside. And when they family goes out to tell her that they will take the home they find her lying dead in the driveway. I don't know about you, but I think at this point any reasonable person with a half of a brain cell would not be looking to buy the house anymore. But, needless-to-say the Benson's do.

After they find the realtor in the drive, the camera cuts to the move in day. Tyler is once again filming the day's proceedings as the movers take in their belongings. Tyler doing his documentary thing talks with the movers and asks them if they had ever heard of the Amityville house and that this was it. The movers have somehow have never heard of the story and laugh it off when Tyler tells them that the house is haunted. Also we find out the invisible friend is back -only this time his name is Jonathon- and he has befriended himself to the youngest daughter. (later we find out that Jonathon was a victim of the DeFeo killing spree) But as the movers finish up their day, Tyler catches on tape one them falling down the stairs and breaking his neck (again we have that annoying cutting and blurring of the camera). You would think that, again, would be reason enough not to live there, but Doug persists that it was no big deal.

The next day, Doug has found that the back door has been left open and he suspects the oldest daughter of sneaking out. After the two get into an argument, Doug seems to have a change of heart and tells the family that they should go to the movies, and that he and Tyler will stay behind and finish up the unpacking.

As the rest leave, Doug takes advantage of their absence and buys and installs a security camera in the living room that has a view of the front and back doors, and while they do we see a ghostly figure outside the window when the camera is left to operate on it's own. Tyler also happens upon an iPhone that the kids in the beginning were using to video each other in the kitchen. And when Tyler is finally able to charge the battery and show them that something supernatural is going on the his parents can only focus on the couple and their relations. He also installs an alarm on the doors as well that goes off when the back door mysteriously opens by itself. Leading to yet another argument with the oldest daughter.

Through out the week the Benson's stay in the house, Tyler makes little vignettes about the days events and the supernatural goings ons.

As the week continues, Doug starts to unravel mentally, his wife grow more adamant on leaving when she's not valiumed out, and the growing dependency of the youngest daughter and her new friend. But when a chance real break-in of the local teenage stud and the oldest daughter trying to hook up with him gives Doug the excuse that what has been going on is in fact the daughter. And when he chases the boy out the door by gun point, Tyler follows him, only to catch him as he is being dragged off by an unseen force.

The police finally get involved when Doug can't find trace of the boy after Tyler yells for him. The responding officer pretty much confirms Doug's earlier thoughts of what is going on is real, telling him that they know all about this kid ands how he hooks up with all the girls on the block, but since he can't find any trace of him in the dark that he'll be back in the morning. Upon the officers arrival he discovers a large pool of blood but no body and enlists the help of a detective who lays out the larger story of the house and how nobody that has ever lived there has stayed more than two months.

At this point, Doug, not certain of anything anymore contacts a war buddy, (named) Cut, who comes over and installs more cameras through-out the house. While Cut is making sure that everything works he catches a brief glimpse of a ghost behind but when he turns around nothings there. But as Cut leaves via the backyard the power line above falls down on him, killing Cut. This begins to really drive a spike mentally into Doug as he now believes that there IS something supernatural going on and tries to find a way to combat it.

The last day begins where we finally see (via Cut's security camera) Jonathon at the table with Tyler and his younger sister and that he wants her to stay with him forever and how she wishes she could as well. Later in the day Doug's mental brake goes into high gear as he starts reliving moments from the service and waves around his pistol. And for what ever the reason his wife doesn't just get up and leave with the children and instead says that they are going to her sisters in a couple of days. The night progress with a ramped supernatural problems leading most of the family to spend the night in the parents room. That is except for the oldest daughter who spends the night in hers.

As we watch her sleep via the camera her father had installed in her room we see as she awakes and then we see her get attacked by something unseen. The camera does it's usual cut out stuff and when it comes back it shows only her legs on the bed and blood on the walls.

Somehow the rest of the family has failed to hear her screams, but after a while the mother awakes and heads down to the dinning room for no apparent reason other than to do so. But as she nears the kitchen she pulled away from the camera view. Her screams awaken Tyler who then follows her downstairs and into the kitchen. He sees nothing on his first pass through but when he goes to turn around he finds his mother on the floor dead and looks to have been burned. Something then grabs his attention off screen but as he turns around he gets grabbed himself and his camera goes dead. The youngest daughter at this point gets up out of bed, the camera cuts and then she standing next to her father who she then stabs in the heart as he is about to get up.

The camera cuts to black a final time but we are able to her the daughter talking to somebody and how she is happy with where she is going to go.

While Amityville Haunting had a decent idea (I'm also a fan of the found footage genre) it lacked quite a bit. The trailer had me sucked in but that was about it when it came to the movie which was a real let down. The parents constant assholeness and complaining and arguing was a real distraction especially when it was combined with the overly used camera flashes and cutting out which was more headache inducing as was scary. However, the old tried and true basic scares that have worked well with other films in thins genre worked here when used and in my opinion would worked far better if used more than the camera work. I would names of the people that played the characters, but IMDB has this movie not coming out until next year sometime and only listed one person in it.

I give Amityville Haunting one and half severed heads out five. Just take a pass on this one because it doesn't really fulfill the wants of the fans of the franchise or that of the found footage genre.

4860071,4,B005QUQRDI,"Another Asylum production, 'The Amityville Haunting' is a budget production which takes its idea from another, more well known film.

A family moves into the famous Amityville house, knowing full well about its gruesome history, but the price is too good for them to miss. Of course, there is a spirit who has other plans for them. Initially, the family acknowledges the house's previous problems but chooses to ignore them. But things start happening and the tension is built quite well. Little things happen at first, then things start to escalate. As the cover art will tell you, it all ends in tragedy.

I thought this film was quite well put together. The Asylum do know how to put a cheap film together if they spend a bit of time thinking about what they are doing. The tension builds gradually and the filmmakers choose to reveal little things along the way, keeping your interest up. Some of the acting is a bit off, particularly from the father as the film draws to a close, but it's passable.

The Blu-ray presentation is pretty good with good clarity and detail but the audio simply isn't what is advertised on the cover - it says there is a DTS-HD track but there is only a Dolby Digital compressed track. Not that it really matters as the type of material doesn't really require too much - it's mainly voices so that's OK. I just don't like incorrect claims....

After some joking around the lewd fun begins which leads to the deaths of said 4 teens, at least I assume they die since we don't see much besides a blood splatter and hear just a few screams. Sometime later a realtor is showing the house off to a family of 5, the young son has a camera he's using to film the experience for a documentary he's doing (however he seems a little young to be making a documentary).

Since the parents are strapped for cash the husband says they'll take the house, which the wife doesn't agree with, oh and suddenly the realtor ends up dead in the driveway of the house, you'll have to wonder how that happened since the director chose not to film it. Soon after moving into the house the son catches some odd and scary happenings, one of them being a mover falling down the stairs and breaking his neck. The mom wants to move out but the dad says they need to give the house a chance since they're again low on money.

The son continues to see strange things happen on his camera, the dad seems to be going a little more insane even after putting a security camera system in the house to catch if someone is breaking into the house at night.

I was always into the original Amityville movies, and as you all know, some of those movies were incredibly dark and depressing and ultimately completely awful cinema. This instalment to the non-official ""series"" was interesting in the sense that Dollhouse was released in 1996 and it's taken them this long to come back to something which isn't the remake (like in '05).

It was refreshing to see a modern take on the series (found footage). As bad as some (most) of the reviews are, the question I would ask is; was this movie really as predictable and as bad as the latest Paranormal Activity?

Some of the things in Haunting make zero sense, like the kid who films everything and at times simply forgets to rewind the footage. Just like in Hollywood. You have to work hard to maintain your sense of disbelief. The effects were awful, in particular when the apparition appears on camera as a crude sprite in the background. It's funny to see the demons working to five days instead of twenty-eight like in 1975 though.

It is another trite and cliche haunted house film that uses the ""found-footage"" technique to alleviate the cast and crew of any responsibility for the poor performances and careless writing. The introduction of the irritating Benson family is enough to drive anyone away immediately, but stick around long enough, and you can marvel as the shadowy CG ghosts dart on and off screen while pushing people down the stairs.

actor by the way finds this phone however it's clearly a Ipod touch but they keep calling it a phone however the
director must have seen this a few scenes in and rightly changed it to a Iphone, how's that for commitment to detail.

4860117,1,B005QUQRDI,"This Amityville spin-off follows the tale of a modern family after they move into the infamous ""Amityville Horror"" house. We see the story unfold in first-person, through the camera of the middle child of the family.

Unfortunately, the film adds nothing new to the franchise, let alone the horror genre in general. The first-person ""found footage"" shaky-cam style is already tired and overworked. In ""The Amityville Haunting,"" the camera's presence itself is often contrived.

The acting is mediocre at best, and laughable at its worst. Every actor in the film has moments so contrived that leave you wondering what drove someone to actually cast them in the film. By the end, the father just becomes cartoonish.

One scene that left me scratching my head involved a detective speaking with the family. He asked them if they knew the history of the house, and proceeded to deliver a monologue in unnatural speech patterns. He then asks if they knew the history of the house (again, after he just explained it?), and finally says as if reading a cue card, ""Let me ask you this: why did you move here?""

Without waiting for a response, he simply turns and walks out the door. Mother begins sobbing, probably not from fear or despair, but likely because it was so painful to sit through the detective's acting.

If you're in the mood for scares, there are none. If you're looking for gore or FX, what little there is will not impress.

Unfortunately, this movie lacks all the frights or production value of the Paranormal Activity series, leaving you feeling flat and a little angry that you spent the time to watch this.

The movie starts with a massacre of random characters that are not really mentioned again. Where was the blood or bodies later? Why don't the cops know of this? It just happens and is done. Then, a tormented family of five moves in. Instantly the bodies start piling up. In 6 days, four people are killed on the property. The cops do not suspect the gun toting, post traumatic stress father. Instead they just throw their hands up. Really? Four bodies in six days, and no one suspects the man who found them and has a gun on his hip? Wow. There are more plot holes in this movie than I can even acknowledge. This is just one.

Some of that can be forgiven if the characters are compelling or the actors charming. Neither one is the case here. Every member of the family is unlikable, boring, and underdeveloped. Jason Williams delivers a performance that offers the only horror of this movie - the horror of a terrible performance.

Clearly when you watch it, our view of the house is kept vague enough to know they are just in any house as external shots are kept to a minimum.

It opens citing the De Feo incident and then how the Lutzes moved in after. Thats about the only relationship this movie has to the previous Amityville franchise. Everything else is shot in ""Paranormal Activity"" style, ala camera point of view where the young boy seems to want to be the next ""Spielberg"" (actual quote). Meanwhile weird things are happening in the house that the boy either gets on video or not. The parents are ignorant, and his hot older sister is too interested in her own wants, while the younger sister seems to make imaginary friends.

The acting is either over or under from the entire family. Clearly it is all scripted and, like all single point of view films, people are completely comfortable in letting out all their baggage and hostilities in front of the camera. And like all the others, people with cameras can multi-task.

I might point out that the video on the phone turns from an iPod to an iPhone. Just an observation.

The many ""black outs"" seem to be ""creative"" budget excuses. But they don't add to the drama or scariness of the film. In fact, the dad, who is the eternal realist, dulls the movie irreparably.

It's a fun movie on it's own, which merits it one or two stars, but ultimately this is not part of the real Amityville franchise. The whole premise of ghostly stuff rests entirely on the Amityville house which, for the audience sake, does not need any real justification as its an already installed storyline.

Given the budget, the film is decent in regards to limited cast, set, props, etc

The director is a complete fail, the script is a complete fail, the plot had potential but completely lost its way with the cast members being incredibly amateurish and disconnected from scenes in the film., maybe we can give blame to the script and direction the director wanted to take the scenes - one can only hope...

I to be honest completed watching the film because of sure irritation and annoyance I got from watching the father and son which oddly led me to be slightly entertained.

The film does attempt to give a sense of impending doom but doesn't accomplish much til the latter part of the film.

The aggravation comes from the attempted build up of the plot where the actors horribly fail, where you will notice either a bit of overacting, complete disconnect from the emotion of the scene, or simple inability to create an honest and true moment.  I give credit, the actress who played the mother did do a much better job then the rest of the cast, I particularly disliked the son's acting, albeit young and unexperienced I would of hoped it was soo obvious that the director could of helped mend some of the inadequate scenes.

I think the director gave up on the film earlier on recognizing perhaps that there was no light at the end of the tunnel and simply turned to complete a film that would get some notice based on name recognition alone - it worked sadly..

Tyler is the only boy in the family, and he walks around filming everything as he has inspirations to be a documentary dude. Tyler finds the cell phone that was left behind and he views the video of the slayings and recognizes that it was at his house that they happened.

 He shows his family, but they brush it off to a practical joke, despite the fact that there have been strange happenings going on in the house. As a security precaution, Douglas, the father installs video cameras around the house. He is an ex-marine with an itchy trigger finger just waiting to catch the culprit who seems to come by every night at 3:15.

 the breakdown

 The Amityville Horror turned out to be one of those classic films, which spawned handfuls of offshoots and sequels. This latest 2011 direct-to-video is the tenth film inspired by the original 1979 film. I like the idea of this being a real haunted house, although the real story is much less spine tingling. It turns out that the grounds where 112 Ocean Avenue stands (now 108 Ocean Ave) were most likely not originally Indian burial grounds. Plus the people that moved into the home after the Defeo murders who claimed that the house was haunted were just a bunch of deadbeats who didn't make any mortgage payments, thus fabricating the story that the house was haunted, this was the whole reason behind the book and the original film.

Yet, if you like horror movies then you are probably familiar with the fictitious story of the evil spirits driving everyone mad in Long Island, NY. This film is set up exactly like the Paranormal Activity premise where the camcorder and stationary cameras through out the home capture the story of what happened to the murdered people who lived in the house. We see the ghosts once in a while, depending on what camera we are looking through. The ghost is supposedly Ronald Defeo Jr, and hes still in the killing mood, plus there are other ghosts we see, mainly children who like to play with the youngest daughter, Melanie.

 The acting was downright awful especially on the parts of Devin Clark who plays Tyler, and Jason Williams who plays the father Douglas. Nadine Crocker who plays the sexy teenage daughter Lori was okay, and the best was Gracie Largent playing Melanie. Luke Barnett plays the Defeo ghost, and his portrayal almost made the movie not scary. I understand why it was direct-to-video, but its worth a late night viewing.

8483768,3,B005QUQRDI,"This movie was actually better than people are claiming. I would have liked it better if there had been a happier ending, but I know that is not what movie making is about these days.  There didn't have to be any really great acting, the performers here did quite well especially considering this was supposed to be a ""found footage"" and one shouldn't expect Oscar material.  But I don't think any of the performances were bad, I've seen a lot worse. The writing was pretty good, too, because I certainly didn't expect Dad to turn out like he did, and it's not quite what those familiar with the Amityville stories normally see in all of the sequels, since Pops was more savvy about what was going  on than in most of these stories, although it didn't quite work out the way it could have.  The movie kept me interested the entire time, I didn't want to leave the room while it was on, and it had enough disturbing incidences to keep the creepiness going.  I think it was worth my time to watch this, so don't pay too much attention to the negativity, and watch it yourself.",1496793600,,1074,4.431472081218274
