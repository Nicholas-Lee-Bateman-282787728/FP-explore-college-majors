*Will dances with Kevin Bacon
*Will dances with Micheal Douglas
*Jack sings with Matt Damon
*Jack sings with Cher
*Karen fights....a lot, especially with Minnie Driver
*Grace is embarassing...a lot, PERIOD.
***Plus there's Barry Manilow!!!!!

Does this news ""Get Your Freak On?""  Then BUY this item, NOW.",1247184000,7,497,4.880952380952381
8343036,3,B001U7NW1Q,"If your a super fan of the television show Will & Grace, then probably already own the season DVDs, but if you happen to be a casual fan or if your curious to see what the show is all about, then these Best of DVDs are perfect.  If you are one of the preivious mentioned television nerds that are curious to find out more about this series let me give you the rundown.  Grace Adler (Debra Messing) is an interior designer that has a creepy best friend relationship with gay lawyer Will (Eric McCormack).  Will hangs out with super flaming gay man Jack (Sean Hayes), and all of them are tormented by rich drunk Karen (Megan Mullally).  This group of misfits share the everyday challenges of everyday life in New York City.

This collection is great for the casual fan, but probably not worth it for the shows real fans.  These discs offer a glimpse into the history of the show and for the most part they get it right.  Love & Marriage has part one of the episode Cheaters which I found odd because after watching it I wanted to see part 2, but it wasn't on the disc.  I personally enjoyed the Friends & Foes collection better than the Love & Marriage one, I found the episodes were funnier and packed a bit more punch.

Overall these collections are pretty cool and priced perfectly for the casual fan that wants to enjoy the show without dropping the coin for the series box sets.",1242172800,9,1381,4.3843137254901965
