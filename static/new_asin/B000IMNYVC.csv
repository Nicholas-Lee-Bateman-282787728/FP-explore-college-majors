2659088,1,B000IMNYVC,"I watched the original telenovela many years ago, and fell in love with it. But this version is absolutely terrible. The editing is just absurd! The story is hacked to bits, and unless you have seen the original, it will make NO sense... It should be make very clear in the description that this is NOT the whole novela, I was very disappointed when I put this in only to find it is a disaster of poor editing. Not pleased with this at all!",1329436800,5,440,4.25
2659089,2,B000IMNYVC,"I watched this soap opera when it was on television.  Loved it, but the DVD that I bought has so many hours missing.  It was so disappointing to see that.  I do not understand how come they did not included all those hours.  That soap opera ran 1 year.  I would have been willing to pay more, but I was not given that option.",1329091200,,325,4.015625

2659091,5,B000IMNYVC,"Everyone wants to borrow this dvd set from me!  The series was classic and even though it is extremely condensed and it left out major issues from the series, for me, this was a great value!  Thanks so much for selling this great dvd set.",1280793600,,238,4.266666666666667
2659092,5,B000IMNYVC,"There are no words, truly, that can convey the monumental and reverberating impact this telenovela has had in Latin America. This telenovela came out in 1997 and dealt with issues mostly considered taboo in Latin America.

The story is about Mara Ins, perfectly played by Angelica Aragn, a woman in her 50s who comes from a respectable and wealthy family. She has a husband and three children. Her world comes tumbling down when her husband leaves her for someone younger, her children's lives are in chaos, and her best friends, Paulina and Rosario, have problems of their own. Enter Alejandro, (Ari Telch) a young (30s) and refreshing journalist that shows Mara what it is to love and feel again. He challenges her in ways she was never challenged before and she struggles with the expectations of her family, society and her mother (Mama Elena) who is the symbol of all that is proper and what society deems the woman should be and do. It was an amazing and deeply emotional love story.

The telenovela deals with many issues: AIDS, drugs, marriage, rape, adultery, age differences in relationships, sex, etc. The telenovela was quite revolutionary for Latin America. It succeeds because the performances were of such a high caliber never to be seen again. Mostly using theater actors, the characters draw you in and involve you in their lives.

All this said, it is a crime that they only offer a 300 minute version (the telenovela showed for months!). Many key scenes are missing, the story seems lacking and the development of the relationships is not well relayed. Watching this you will never really understand the deep connections between all of these characters, never really care for them. Watch it if you must or if you have already seen the full version.",1217030400,10,1767,4.863787375415282

The sequel Mirada de Mujer, El Regreso (TV series telenovela 2003-2004)
You definately need to buy both DVD, combined the run time on this is more than 16 hours.

I am currently watching telenovela on TV called Victoria with Victoria Ruffo. It's a remake of Mirada de Mujer.

There's infidelity theme unplanned pregancy, eating disorders, drugs, cancer, domesitc violence,....and just about everything else you can imagine.

I enjoyed watching Mirada de Mujer, and I look forward to looking at the sequel later this montnh.",1212192000,,573,5.274725274725275
2659095,5,B000IMNYVC,"This is one of the best films that I have seen, this soap exposes the situations that the hispanic families have to face one time or another. It was very heart warming and real. At the end of the fifth dvd I was crying but I never felt better.  Thank you for making this ""telenovela"" available to many of us.",1209945600,3,308,4.133333333333334
2659096,1,B000IMNYVC,"this and corazn salvaje are by far one of the best telenovelas of the 90's.  but mirada de mujer reigns supreme mainly because it dealt with a lot of issues that were not addressed before or since.  i was 18 when this telenovela came out and cried my eyes out for the whole three days the finale lasted in my country (i live in san juan).  angelica aragon is a true diva and this role was tailored made for her.  and ari telch... what can i say?  i want an alejandro salas.

however... this dvd doesn't do this amazing telenovela any justice.  they botched the whole thing.  for example: paulina dealing with hiv, rosario's breast cancer, monica's rape... and this are the only things i can remember...

there was even this rumor that mirada had three different endings.  but with the way the production house botched the ending as well for this dvd... you will never find out the pearls of wisdom from alejandro's dog nixon.

if you saw this when it came out... don't buy this disappointment of a dvd and remember this telenovela for the masterpiece that it is.

i wish i could rate this dvd with zero stars!!!",1209254400,8,1111,4.472636815920398
2659097,2,B000IMNYVC,"When I saw this TV novela in Mexico, I loved the story! It's so realistic and the acting is excellent. It shows the contemporary society of Mexico in a very open way. It has topics like: infidelity & double life, divorce, aids, breast cancer, the love affair between Maria (50 year old) and Alejandro (ten years younger than her)and how the family can overcome all this life challenges. I love the strength of Maria! It's just that the editting is so poor! I paid 70 dlls for this novela and I'm so dissapointed! It gets so many cuts that it is impossible to follow by someone who has never seen it before! I suggest they could do another version with not so many edditing, maybe 12 to 14 hours of TV novela! And if possible, it would be great to have it with English subtitles. I know many people in Montreal area who would like to see it and they do not speak Spanish, they have seen it before in Rumania, the Russia, Israel!",1181347200,10,927,4.333333333333333

8146262,3,B000IMNYVC,"My mom wanted this because she enjoyed the story from way back.

So it was really more of a nostalgia purchase. However they have to cut everything down into just 5 DVD's so they really shorten the story line.

They shorten it so much to the point where it doesn't even make sense. You really don't get any of the backstory on the characters, and it's just not the same.

I wanted to watch this but we stopped after just 2 ""episodes"".",1464220800,2,434,4.2682926829268295
