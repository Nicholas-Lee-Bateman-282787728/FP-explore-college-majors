Each story is different and has it's own unique plot, this is why I bought all of them. Maybe find one Tomie movie to rent before you start buying them, as I believe this character is not for everyone; she's cruel and sometimes disgusting, she's manipulative, powerful, indestructible and she knows it. These attributes are why I love her, but I could see how they could be off-putting for the more sensative person.",1473811200,,575,4.75
8124432,2,B000FKPE88,"I liked the Tomie additions that I had seen - until i ran into this one. I do not want to waste a lot of time on it because i don't think you should say too much on the negative side. Instead, it should be noted that the problems are visual, that the sound is bad, that the story is not really there, and that this does not fit into the Tomie additions. I thought the acting was good enough - hence the addition of a star - BUT that I would not have bothered getting this had I known what I was walking into.

It is sad to see Ito's creation here but do not take it out on all the Tomie movies. Some of them are rather good and this is more like an exception than the thing you expect.",1266883200,,685,3.823943661971831
8124433,1,B000FKPE88,"Yes, as the other reviews state.. this movie was sad.
I'm a HUGE Tomie fan, but this movie just made no sence! First of all, the one that I had contained some of the worst subtitles I have ever seen. It's hard enough to follow an extremely slow movie and on top of that have subtitles that don't even translate well. The plot.. well, the seriously wasn't even a plot! This one fails compaired to the other Tomies.

It's perfectly okay to skip this one.",1240099200,,452,4.317647058823529
8124434,2,B000FKPE88,This film is one of two Tomie movies that came out following the first five movies.  It was done all wrong and the back of the box pretty much sums the entire movie.  It starts out good but then you can lose interest really quick.  Also the actress that plays Tomie wasn't all that pretty either and supposedly all men fall for her because shes drop dead beautiful.  The conclusion was really predictable and this film is too short.  I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.  Get Tomie The Beginning which as a lot better than this one.,1211760000,,535,4.408163265306122
8124435,2,B000FKPE88,"I am one of those few who genuinely like the Tomie franchise, and I was sorely disappointed by this film. The lead actress, Hisako Shirata, is quite good... but the script and HD video look kill the film. They try so hard to explain what Tomie is, that the dread, fear and suspense is gone. The gore is there, sure... but without a good story, who cares? Also, the CGI effects are, as usual, bad.

I suppose the people who found the first Tomie slow, confusing and boring might enjoy this, but everyone else, beware. Get the Tomie box-set (with the best 3 films in it) instead.",1183593600,,577,4.392523364485982
