Some of the selections are dreamy and calming, and there are also a few really upbeat and energizing pieces on it, too.  And I'm a ""tough customer"" who is difficult to satisfy, so if I say that this recording is really nice, you can count on it that it is OUTSTANDING!  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",1179705600,,417,4.830985915492958
