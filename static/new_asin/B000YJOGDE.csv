3030107,4,B000YJOGDE,"Intelligent plot, Clayton Moore's favorite someone writes,  with some interesting turns an adult would like as well as the generation of straight shooters the Lone Ranger helped raise. While it was good to see values like fairness, respect, justice and kindness woven into the plot, with Kemosabe upholding civil rights of Native Americans and never fighting the Indians, I wish that were true and had happened,  From reading historical markers driving through Texas,  the Caddo First Nation peoples had been pushed from East to West Texas, around where the Lone Ranger is set, Abilene/Brazos River area.  The markers say eventually these Indians were forced on to Oklahoma.  Maybe he and Tonto  shine a light on how things should have been and should be, a message hopefully supporting Indians and raising  awareness and help American Indians going forward.",1446940800,,858,5.218978102189781

I used to watch them them on the old black and white TV with the doors on it,(lol) back then,  and wow, now in color!  Being older now too, I have more admiration for his physique too. So a whole new admiration. I just read that Clayton Moore was an acrobat prior to his acting career. There will never be another for the role, unlike the James Bond or Batman movies. UZ Clayton Moore loyalists just won't care to go see anyone else. Just as we stood behind him when they wouldn't let him wear the mask.

3030169,4,B000YJOGDE,"Holds up pretty well after all these years. The villains represent all the same forces of evil--greed, racism, patriarchythat we can still recognize and need to defeat, and the problems of frontier territories are still an issue in those exact same backwards fly-over states. We are paying the price yet today for our national heritage of genocide and slavery, so those overtones are still quite relevant. The only thing that's a bit dated is the concept that there is some EFFECTIVE crusader for truth, justice and human dignity roaming among us working to hold our villains to account.

We still believed in that model of a better world within the first decades after the war, but since the Reagan era we know better. I grew up in So. Calif. and took weekend excursions to the same desert/foothill locations that Hollywood used for these archetypal movies, so we kids always felt close to the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy, but once we grew up and fell under the spell of the western charm of a right-wing ideologue movie star, the chances of finding a masked crusader with multi-cultural influences dropped out of the popular imagination.

3030256,2,B000YJOGDE,"Earlier this century I owned THE LONE RANGER special edition from VCI Video which contained the 1956 LONE RANGER movie with both the full screen and widescreen options. I mean the whole point of the movie was for the TV shows fans to get out of the house and into movie theaters to see their favorite hero both In Color and in Widescreen. What kid and some parents could resist such an offering?!

Being a baby-boomer fan of the TV show, I enjoyed seeing Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels in widescreen color so much that I loaned out the DVD to friends until it did not come back.  Once I realized that this edition of the clear quill LONE RANGER was missing from my collection, I went to Amazon to find a replacement.

First I tried the LONE RANGER double bill which included The City of Gold as well. Both films were Fullscreen. The widescreen version from VCI Entertainment is no longer in their catalog which could explain the $35 - $105 price through Amazon.

But seeing the above image, I thought that I had found a widescreen version once more. But no.  The sealed DVD which I ordered from an Amazon vendor had a different package image clearly listed as Fullscreen on the back. I gave it another shot because of the image above and ordered the full-priced official Amazon DVD. Today I received the full priced DVD with the same packaging as that of the vendor DVD. It seems to me that Amazon should specifically list this edition of THE LONE RANGER as Fullscreen only with the actual packaging image on the DVD being sold.

I regret that the 1981 Klinton Spilsbury and the 1913 Armie Hammer Lone Rangers are the only forgettable ones that we can see in widescreen. Neither film brings back those thrilling days of yesteryear touted on radio and TV. I regret that the 1981 and 1913 versions of the Lone Ranger are probably blocking the re-release  of Clayton Moores iconic and favorite Lone Ranger film in widescreen. Clayton Moore could actually act as he demonstrates in several of the Lone Ranger's disguises. He had earned his chops not only on the TV in the 50s, but as the villains chief henchman in several of the best Republic Saturday serials in the 40s. Warner Brothers or VCI Entertainment should re-release it. Either way, I'd buy The widescreen 1956 Lone Ranger were Amazon to offer it at a reasonable price.",1412553600,,2329,4.597590361445783

3030262,5,B000YJOGDE,"From an origin episode which talks about the Cavendish gang and finding Silver to a full color episode from the final season, this collection represents the series well. A few episodes feature hard-to-find samples of the season which had John Hart replace Clayton Moore. That is a well-rounded survey.
The true debate about who played the Lone Ranger better should skip the two recent movie exploitation disasters and begin with radio's Brace Beemer. Clayton Moore found it difficult to step into Beemer's magnificent voice. But television won out. John Hart played the Lone Ranger with a bit less of a stilted manner than Moore, but the public seems not to have accepted him. Moore was brought back for the remainder of the series.
This collection permits today's viewer to see both television actors who played the masked rider as well as an episode filmed in glorious color before there was color television.
Incidentally, for comic book fans, the traditional comic strip and early comic books had the masked man wearing black pants and a splendid red shirt. Television filming seemed to require the silly light bluework uniform some of us came to hate. The final indignity of that day was when the Dell comic books switched to the television blues.
So, return to those days of yesteryear and enjoy the variety of this disc. Whether an old-timer looking back or a younger historian making discovery, this is enough for Lone Ranger 1, a rewarding non-credit course. Enjoy.",1409011200,,1474,4.97165991902834
3030263,4,B000YJOGDE,"The Lone Ranger is one of those iconic characters that have left a significant mark in pop culture history. Even for those unfamiliar with the old radio show, movie serials, the famous television series, comics, or movies, most people still recognize his catchphrase, Hi-Yo, Silver! Much like Zorro or other heroes created in the early 20th century, hes resonated with fans of all ages for his bravery and simple ideals of heroism. Hes one of the classic archetypes for heroes, standing for truth, justice, and the American way even before Superman did.

His television series ran from 1949 to 1957, being the first televised western and building on the characters substantial popularity at the time. It starred Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as the two leads, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, and was such a success that two feature length films were released as part of the canon. The first was simply titled, The Lone Ranger.

The movie opens with a brief intro narration establishing the west as a place for hardened pioneers and a very harsh lifestyle. Out of this came a legendary hero. Cue the music, roll the credits. Even the sound of William Tell Overture brings to mind this lighthearted and unrelentingly noble character as he sits tall atop a white horse. After that, the characters begin a new adventure.

Theres little setup to the heroes, forsaking a retelling of his origin for a bigger scale plotline. They gloss over it a one point, but such backstories hardly mattered for the pulp heroes. The movie plays out like a lengthier episode of the show, but with full color and a larger budget to tell the story. The story is of a greedy land owner who has his sights set on a large mountain in the territory. The only problem is that the mountain is part of the Native Americans reservation, and they have a stable peace treaty with the ranchers. Thats when natives begin suddenly stealing and killing cattle for no reason, prompting the ranchers to want the natives relocated or eliminated altogether. Enter the Lone Ranger.

The story of race conflict and deception for motives of greed is a common one from the series, but here its given more time to build and a lot more thrills than the television show was capable of producing. Whether its Tonto fighting alone against an entire towns lynch mob or the Lone Ranger shooting a stick of dynamite out of the air as its thrown at him, there are some genuinely exciting moments. The plot is revealed slowly as it unravels piece by piece, but its nothing terribly complicated or groundbreaking. Like I said, it has a familiar feel to it for anyone who watched the show, but the action and scale make up for this.

Clayton Moore is perfect as the hero, it being a character he portrayed for over thirty years, and its clear by how natural he looks and acts with the mask. His face is never shown, either always covered by the mask or make-up when hes in disguise as a wily old prospector. The same quality and naturalness is true for Jay Silverheels as Tonto, whos given a significant and exciting action sequence all to himself in this story. Although all the Native Americans, including Tonto, speak in the clich&eacute;d pidgin English, they are not depicted badly. Its just a product of its time. Tonto is always shown to be a capable and honorable character, whose altruism equally matches the Lone Rangers. The other natives are also portrayed by Native American actors and given clear motivations and characters.

One of the major conflicts in the movie is that the ranchers are violating the peace treaty and wanting to push them further off their lands (this not being the first time), and this makes some of the natives agree that war is the correct path. It will end in slaughter, but its better to die than be treated so poorly. Its a sympathetic plight and something both heroes desperately want to prevent.

The first Lone Ranger movie is surprisingly good and a fun western. It has some great stunts and really good action scenes, but best of all it captures the classic nature of an iconic hero.",1408492800,,4071,4.709269662921348

3030306,5,B000YJOGDE,"'The Lone Ranger Story' part of this DVD package is great to have available after such a long period of time. This one hour feature is  a special that was created in 1955 for the 22nd Anniversary of the program (22 years includes the radio program years) using the first three episodes of the TV series from 1949 edited together, that provide the answers to the origin of The Lone Ranger. An all new opening (for 1955) was created to introduce the Anniversary special as well as a special ending. This TV special was aired again in 1958 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary.  Good Times Home Video used to release these great previously unavailable films and specials, but they vanished after the era of VHS bit the dust. It is an extremely welcome return via DVD's from Legend Films that some (so far) have reappeared on the home video market.  It's also nice to have the feature presentation from 1940 of the 1938 15 chapter movie serial included, but to be honest I would have been just as happy to have 'The Lone Ranger Story' if it was the only selection on this DVD. Thanks Legend Films!",1388880000,,1090,4.522842639593908
3030307,5,B000YJOGDE,"I grew up watching reruns of Clayton Moore's ""Lone Ranger"" TV show. When I recently watched the full length movie, I was concerned that it would be like other converted TV series, and lose a step. To the contrary. It holds up, carrying all of the drama, majesty and heroics of the original.

The plot is simple: the bad guy wants to control a silver lode by causing Indians (who own it) to be vanquished in a battle built on false accusations. The Lone Ranger's job, with trusty Tonto, is to stop it.

How will go is somewhat predictable. You know the good guys will win. That's the grandness of the movie: despite knowing, you love it. I did. It is good old fashioned Saturday afternoon movie watching. Break open the popcorn.

Clayton Moore is, of course, ""The Lone Ranger."" Any other actor in his debt for perfecting the role. Here, he does not disappoint.

There's a good message in there about racial harmony and true, not vigilante, justice.

I fully recommend, ""The Lone Ranger.""

The episodes continue to entertain new generations of television viewers.  It was never necessary for Hollywood to remake this legendary TV show.

3030326,3,B000YJOGDE,"We just saw the new movie ""The Lone Ranger"".  It was very good.  The major problem that I had was that it was too tongue and cheek in some of the dialog.  The music was very good esp in the last half hour.  The movie is supposed to take place in 1869 before and during the time that the railroads were joined.  During the joining a band was playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever"".  The only problem with that is that tune was not penned until 1896! Also they played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". In most important events of that era ""Hail Columbia"" or ""My Country Tis of Thee"" were played.  You would think that the person in charge of the music would have realized the error.  Other then those minor problems the movie was good.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1374537600,,761,4.229166666666667
3030327,5,B000YJOGDE,"It's been decades since I've seen a Lone Ranger Episode and I am not disappointed. There have been some complaints about this DVD being issued in 1:33. What those viewers probably don't understand is that this was the early days of wide screen film. Prints were issued in 1:33 because not all movie houses had the correct lenses to show all formats. Some were still showing 1:33 others could show 1:85 some 1:66. So the producers issued the films ""full frame"" (no hard matting) so that each house could show it how it was able to, using as much of the frame as they needed to. The film was printed ""full frame"". Later on they started hard matting the picture so there was no option but to show it 1:85 and by that time movie houses had the lenses they needed.

This works the same with this DVD. You can show it full frame (1:33) but it shows fine ""zoomed in"" to 1:75 (wide screen TV) try it. We just watched this film in ""zoom mode"" (so it filled the screen horizontally) and it played fine.

The video is not restored but it didn't bother me. I wish they would make movies with a good moral message, like this one, again.",1374105600,,1123,4.317535545023697

3030329,5,B000YJOGDE,"I am a long time Lone Ranger fan.  I watched the first episodes when they were first on TV for the very first time.  This DVD is excellent!  It should not be marked down because it is not in color.  The color one does not seem to exist.  The DVD case does not say it is in color---some seller made the listing and that seller put down that it is in color.  We are rating the film for quality of picture & sound ---not some error on the listing.

It is common to list older TV shows as being 30 minutes in length when we all know that there are commercials that reduce the actual show time.  Although the DVD case says 90 minutes, we all know better.  In addition, the openings & closings of the film take time away from the actual story.  This DVD shows all 3 shows as if it was only one show.  It could have been shown in a theatre.  There is only one opening and one closing for the entire DVD.  This also shortens the run time.  I am quite sure that the opening & closing is probably slightly shorter than the original ones. These probably were modified for rerun purposes.

All in all, you will be very please with this product.  I am very familiar with Westlake Entertainment and they always do a first class job.",1374019200,,1218,4.163090128755365

3030334,5,B000YJOGDE,"I'm old enough to remember what was referred to in the old show as ""those thrilling days of yesteryear..."".  I always enjoyed the old Lone Ranger show.  BUT that was some pretty straight laced stuff.  The old Lone Ranger and his trustee sidekick were not funny people.  I don't recall ever once seeing them laugh, or making me laughing in response to any of their material.  They were just a couple of do-gooder's who helped folks out every week.  Such a dry format could never work in today's savvy viewer market.
The current Lone Ranger is cheesy, it's campy, it's engaging, and it's filled with lots of humor.  While not being a comedy per se, it is filled with enough light hearted humor to make it a FUN movie to watch.  Is it slow, as I've heard accused?  I didn't think so.  I thought the pace was pretty good.  I didn't feel it was too long either -- about right.
I have watched the media trash this movie, and frankly I can't understand what their motive is.  This is a charming movie with a familiar plot that is well done enough to engage the audiences.  Case in point -- my audience all applauded at the end of the show.
As far as the cast goes -- this show isn't just dominated by Johnny Depp. Both lead characters are very strong and likable.
Before going, I read four different reviews of this movie -- all terrible -- and almost DIDN'T go see it based on them.  What a mistake that would have been, as The Lone Ranger turned out to be one of the best movie experiences I've had this year.  DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD OF THE CRITICS ON THIS ONE.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE FOR YOURSELF!!",1373414400,,1590,4.303030303030303
3030335,1,B000YJOGDE,"I was expecting something exciting, new, enthralling- well, basically entertaining. How could it go wrong? It's Johnny Depp! It's the Lone Ranger- the mask, Silver the wonder horse, The William Tell overture! Well, I was ready to go back to the concession stand about at the 30 minute mark. then, I did not mind the restroom breaks- didn't even have to wait for some ""unimportant two minutes part- they seemed to all be unimportant parts! Finally, about at the 1 hr, 45 min mark, I found myself wondering if I should just leave- I had had quite enough. As for the Lone Ranger- the writers decided, apparently, he would just treat the ""wizened Sage"" Tonto as a three year old child. Huh? Tonto was the maker of the Lone Ranger- the man's savior! And a loyal and equal side kick- And, for Tonto- Who at Disney dreamed up the outrageous costume - did they go to Africa? Perhaps back from Dogon Ceremonial Mask collection? Toltec Sacrificial Masks? Or did they just pick something from a clown makeup catalogue and toss in a few turkey feathers. Actually, placing black *'s or +'s over Depp's eyes might have enlivened it, giving the audience something to get a chuckle out of- any emotion would have sufficed! I tried to enjoy it. I made every excuse. I even tried reverting back to my child hood mind set to imagine the time in my life when I idolized the moralistic, brace, manly, talented Lone Ranger. He stood for something I grew up trying to emulate- But, this movie just defeated every effort and I was one of the first to get out of the theater near the ending...I had seen enough.

Sure it was hokey and unrealistic in many parts but so are so many other movies that get 5 star reviews.  This movie has everything - drama, suspense, comedy, fight scenes, bad men, etc.  This 2+ hour movie was over before I knew it. I enjoyed it and so did two of the other people I went with.  The fourth said it was a lot better than expected.  For anyone, including baby boomers, who did not know how The Lone Ranger became the masked man, the movie explains how it all came about.

I've read and heard  a lot of criticism about Johnny Depp as Tonto.  In my opinion he did an amazing job portraying Tonto.  He put his own spin on the character and made it his own.  The lines between The Lone Ranger and Tonto are very clever.

There was a lot of joyful laughter in the movie theater when we saw this film.  So, don't believe the critics.  Judge it for yourself.  You just might be extremely pleasantly surprised like I was.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, young and old alike.",1373328000,,1324,4.248995983935743
3030338,4,B000YJOGDE,"We went and saw this film today and it was Hilarious! Johnny Depp is right in character and Army Hammer portrayed the Lone Ranger in classic Clayton Moore style. The movie takes the time to set the scenes and introduce the viewers to what is to come. This movie was not meant to be a documentary or even a novel like ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Lincoln"". It's fun and entertaining. It is told from the view point of ""Tonto"" and how he helps to lead to Lone Ranger (Army Hammer)"" to realize his destiny. I would recommend seeing it. Don't expect anything but a very amusing and entertaining time at the movies.  I don't know what the ""Critics"" are talking about. If they keep comparing Johnny Depp's future films to ""Pirates"", they will never appreciate anything else he does. ""Pirates"" is a Johnny Depp trade mark which will live forever. However, he should not be ""Type Casted"" in this roll and everything he does afterwards fails in comparison. This simply is NOT the case. It is easy for those on the outside to criticize, but they are NOT Actor's and if they were put in this position, would have no clue on how to transition from one roll to another. GO SEE IT and judge for yourself. Don't let these reviews cloud your own judgement.",1373328000,,1235,4.464601769911504

The scenery was awesome and the characters heart-felt and so enjoyable.  Please don't be afraid to see it because of the 2 hr. 30 min. run.  The time went so fast, we were disappointed when it was over.  With that said, we hope to see it again, especially while it is still on the big screen.  This type of movie would be lost on TV, but then again, we might watch it again when it is available there as well.  Go - have fun - laugh and listen carefully for all the little comments that are so special and unique to all the characters, especially Johnny.  We would recommend it highly.",1373328000,,733,4.223021582733813

The plot is entertaining, the excitement is ongoing, but the interaction between the main characters is beyond description.  I hope to see this movie again before it leaves theatres because the quips were so continual that I'm sure I missed some the first time around.  I wasn't bored for one iota of a second and was totally immersed in the action for the entire 2+ hours.  I loved this movie!!!!",1373241600,,537,4.804347826086956

The works are amazingly clear given the age of the original series, and the sound quality was well done. I found no problems with watching them, except to get them away from my husband long enough to check them out for a review.

It is interesting that this isn't a single united series, but rather a selection of favorites from the series. Husband is happy, so is his wife.

The music was changed from the William Tell Overtures to music that was presented on other shows of this period, however, it doesn't detract from the value of the show. Recommended.!

Undoubtedly our parents watched the originals, but like anything, it was new to us and we loved them anyway. We didn't have a color television set and these nostalgic selections do bring back memories.

It was serious stuff when Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto) hit the little screen. There's not a lot of analyzing to do about this series because most kids I know simply loved the duo. If you like oldies, but goodies, you'll love this sampling.  Note that during Season 3, John Hart played the Lone Ranger, but Clayton Moore returns during Season 4.

I have such fond memories of humming the tune from the soundtrack featuring The William Tell Overture and despite being a girl, quite enjoyed the pair's adventures through the wild west.

This DVD (I was provided a review copy by the seller), ""The Lone Ranger: Hi-Yo Silver Away!"" features eight random episodes:

The Lone Ranger Fights On (Season One, original airdate Sep 22, 1949, B&W)
Outlaw of the Plains (Season One, original airdate July 6, 1950, B&W)
Mr. Trouble (Season 2, original airdate March 8, 1951, B&W)
The Brown Pony (Season 3, original airdate May 14, 1953, B&W)
The Old Cowboy (Season 3, original airdate June 25, 1953, B&W)
The Midnight Rider (Season 3, original airdate July 16, 1953, B&W)
Trapped (Season 4, original airdate August 4, 1955, B&W)
Quarter Horse War (Season 5, original airdate November 8, 1956, Color)

Note: In Season 3, John Hart replaces Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger before Moore returns in Seasons 4 and 5. Season 5 was filmed in color.

The total running time is approx. 200 minutes. There is no Closed Caption/Subtitle option which would have been nice for the hearing-impaired. The sound quality is clear and the image is also crisp given the show's age. This would make a nice gift for a Lone Ranger fan and is budget friendly.",1369872000,,1445,4.699604743083004

3030372,5,B000YJOGDE,"Only a churl would complain about a Lone Ranger movie! This episode is a winner all around.  It even has a plot, with a defined beginning, middle and end:

It seems that Black Hat Lyle Bettger (""Kilgore"") wants to banish the peaceable local Indian tribe from their reservation. He has discovered a lode of silver in a sacred mountain. The real Black Hat is Robert J. Wilke, Bettger's foreman (""Cassidy""). This reviewer seems to remember Wilke for  hassling Montgomery Clift in ""From Here to Eternity"", getting himself stabbed by James Coburn in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and as one of the 5 bad guys in ""High Noon"".  That's quite a resume.

The film quality here is excellent, with fine sharp colors and nice western scenery. What's not to like indeed? Do the Ranger and Tonto let Bettger get away with his evil scheme? Of course not! The good guys win-and in a fine old-fashioned 1950s way. Previous reviewer Ojanen (from Finland, no less) urged us to ""Just Enjoy It""! Great advice!",1358035200,,981,4.747058823529412

3030379,5,B000YJOGDE,"I was SO GLAD I got this.  Once I read in another review that it had an interview with The Lone Ranger's daughter, Dawn Moore, I HAD to get it!  This movie and The Lone Ranger TV show came out before I was born.  I watched the show in syndication as a child.  This movie has everything-great scenery, action, adventure, suspense, and best of all, a great story with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.  It's very exciting to watch, and really showcases the Lone Ranger.  I love that the Ranger and Tonto come to each other's aid when needed; that is most gratifying to me.  The one part I found hard to watch is near the beginning when Tonto goes into town and winds up being beat up by a bunch of Indian-hating townspeople, but of course the Ranger comes to rescue him.  All ends well, and the villain's wife is played by Bonita Granville Wrather, the wife of Jack Wrather, the owner of the Lone Ranger character.
 I also immensely enjoyed the interview with Dawn Moore, done by film critic Leonard Maltin, who is a lifelong Lone Ranger fan.  I'm envious of him that he got to meet BOTH Clayton Moore and his daughter.  There is another interview with actor Michael Ansara on this DVD; I only watched part of it, as I was more interested in the interview with Dawn Moore, which lasts about 37 minutes and was done Feb. 2001.",1347926400,,1324,4.407407407407407

All of them have running times of over 22 minutes each, so if they are edited or speeded up electronically as some reviewers say it could still be a lot worse. There are several abrupt fades to black (maybe to eliminate sponsor mentions?) and some of the action does look a bit too fast, but that may have been because the producers originally speeded up the film to make the cowboy action seem more intense. I have no idea. All I can tell you is that I paid $7.93 for ten episodes I thoroughly enjoyed and will rewatch again and again. HIGHLY recommended!",1325116800,,774,4.344827586206897

The only complete original episodes could be in someones home library taped maybe 30 years ago, when VCR'S made their first appearance, (You know, the 40-50 pound models,) from an independent channel as I did.

Just like The Adventures of Superman, someone had the foresight
to film the last part of the series in color. This was very ex-
pensive at the time of filming. And on top of that there were
only a very few color TV's at that time.

I, very fondly, remember watching The Lone Ranger with my grand-
father on Sat afternoons. Since he died when I was 13 or 14 I
am glad for these memories.

However, I gave the DVD only four stars because I was led to believe in its advertising that it contained color episodes of the Lone Ranger series (1956-57).  It does not.

3030411,5,B000YJOGDE,"It's a shame that this film is not more widely known and available, because it represents the pinnacle of the Lone Ranger, at least the on-screen version.  In addition to being the Lone Ranger's zenith, it also ranks among the Greatest Super-Hero Films of All Time, and is very good Western in its own right.

This is a good disk, relatively clear picture, functions well, and the inclusion of the original trailers for both this film and the sequel 'Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold,' is nice.  It would be nice to have a few more extras or special features, seeing as how much Lone Ranger material must really be out there, but I guess I shouldn't complain.

The TV series (which, BTW, I loved) was always hampered by shooting schedule and budget, so location filming, riding scenes, fight scenes, etc., were always kept to a minimum.  And usually the sets always looked as if they were constructed in 3 hours by the technicians at a local TV station in Cleveland, Ohio.

But in this film, besides being in color and having lots of outdoors scenes, there are plenty of great riding and fight scenes, including a full blown stampede.  Best of all, both the Masked Man and Tonto each get to do a full-blown, knock-down, drag out fist fight.  (Tonto's fight sequence is the more impressive one, since he ends up holding his own against an entire mob, until the sheer numbers inevitably overpower him.  I won't spoil it how that situation resolves...)  Additional treats include the Lone Ranger donning the Old Geezer disguise he often used in the TV series, and Silver doing some memorable work (similar to Lassie or Flipper, yet amazingly, this does not come off as corny).

Certainly there were no other actors, at least on screen, who ever did or ever could portray the Masked Man and Tonto as good as Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.  Considering the material they had to work with, it would have been extremely easy for them to overdo it, or to be corny or campy.  But no, they each had an almost magical ability to make these potentially ludicrous characters believable and likable.

I am especially impressed by Silverheels, whose dialog for some inexplicable reason was always written as Johnny Weismueller-style broken English, always delivered his lines with credibility.  Tonto was never ridiculous, rather the opposite.  In this film, unfortunately, all the Native Americans have to speak in this idiotic way, and you can see how hard it is to be take these guys seriously.  Yet Silverheels' Tonto always projects intelligence and valor, despite horrible lines.  I attribute this to Silverheels' ability as an actor.

It's undeniable that the Lone Ranger's target audience was mostly kids, and that his appeal to adults draws its strength from the well of our childhood.  Yet it is a mistake to classify this film as being strictly for kids; there are in fact, many adult themes.  For instance, in one very effective sequence, a racially-motivated mob attempts to lynch Tonto.  I don't think there is anything on the Disney channel today, with our supposedly uncensored media, that deals with the American tradition of lynching (which was never formally outlawed until the 1960's).

The plot itself is concerned with a very adult theme, something that is perhaps more timely now even than in 1956.  The main action is concerned with the activities of a wealthy white man and his vicious second-in-command who engineer a series of `false flag' attacks and incidents so as to cause a group of darker-skinned persons to be blamed.  (No, this is not the story of the Bush Administration, except as allegory.)  The false flag attacks are intended to promote a war between whites, who have greater wealth and weaponry, and the Indians, so that the small group of whites can seize control of the natives' valuable mineral resources.

This film has a view of Pioneer/Indian conflicts that, besides being historically accurate, is surprising to find in 1956.  The Lone Ranger himself says outright that in all the fights between Whites and Indians, it's the Whites who have always started the trouble.  There are anti-war as well as anti-racism messages that seem ahead of their time.

The Masked Man and Tonto, as unequivocal representatives of Good, channel their energies into a desperate campaign to prevent a destructive war.  These two heroes have no super-powers or abilities, but appear to draw their strength from a respect for human life and a sense of fairness.  They remind us of what we knew to be right when we were children, and inspire us to believe in those things again.",1225670400,,4597,4.861360718870347
3030412,4,B000YJOGDE,"First the plus -- The picture quality is superb. No doubt about it. There are extras and while they are nothing special, they are worth the price of admission.

3030415,4,B000YJOGDE,"ALPHA VIDEO's THE LONE RANGER is a nice budget priced sampler of four episodes from the pioneering TV series' first year. Popular on radio and in movies, the Ranger enjoyed a five season run, airing 221 half-hour chapters on the ABC-TV network every Thursday at 7:30 pm from 9/15/49 to 6/6/57. (Seasons #1, #3 and #4 were a now unheard of 52 weeks each!) Clayton Moore starred, but so did John Hart, who portrayed the Ranger in season #3. Jay Silverheels played Tonto, and the stentorian announcer/narrator was Fred Foy.

Our story's a familiar one: A badly-wounded Texas Ranger, the only survivor of an ambush, is found by an Indian who nurses him back to health. The two men become friends and partners in a fight for law and order, with the masked Ranger at times dispensing instant justice in the form of a silver bullet.

SYNOPSES:
THE LEGION OF OLD TIMERS--  A rancher (played by Star Trek's Dr. McCoy, DeForest Kelley) is being forced to sell his inherited property. The Ranger, Tonto and the man's hired hands join forces to restore the ranch to its righful owner.

THE RENEGADES--  Tonto and his friend Chief Swift Eagle (Ralph Moody) are the targets of a corrupt Indian Agent and his Army deserter cohorts.

OLD JOE'S SISTER--  Two prison escapees flee to Joe Peter's cabin, where one convict kills both his jailmate and Joe. He then masquerades as Joe, fooling the man's sister who comes to visit her brother for the first time in 30 years.

CANNONBALL MCKAY--  An ex-con stage driver is framed for a Wells Fargo office robbery and rearrested. The actual holdup men plan to get rid of him by bombing the jail where he's being held.

3030416,5,B000YJOGDE,"When Clayton Moore assumed his signature role as The Lone Ranger in 1949, the character had been a fixture on the radio since 1933, played most notably by Earle Graser and then Brace Beemer.  (It is actually Beemer's voice, not Moore's, heard calling out ""Hi-Yo Silver"" at the beginning and end of the TV episodes.)  And Moore himself had starred in a number of other vehicles, most notably the Republic Pictures cliffhanger serials ""Perils of Nyoka,"" ""Jesse James Rides Again,"" ""G-Men Never Forget,"" and ""Ghost of Zorro.""  (The last role led directly, as I believe has mentioned elsewhere, to his casting as ""the OTHER Masked Rider of the Plains."")  So, while it is perfectly understandable and unobjectionable that some who are fans only of The Lone Ranger TELEVISION show might look askance at what must be admitted to be a drastically different portrayal, others might well be interested in looking at the earlier, certainly no less authentic incarnations of the character, and particularly this one from the world of cliffhanger serials in which Moore himself first achieved stardom.  The 1938 movie serial of ""The Lone Ranger"" is not only generally regarded as one of the finest examples of the serial form, it also marks an epoch in the developing mythos of the Lone Ranger himself, for it is here, for the first time anywhere, that the story of his mysterious origin was told, being slightly reworked for the radio program only several years later, and then adapted for the first three episodes of the TV show.  It is unfortunate that most of the serial exists only in quite poor condition, but as much has been done here as possible to make it viewable (for instance, by replacing the original serial footage where possible with equivalent sequences from the much shorter feature-length version, ""Hi-Yo Silver,"" which has survived in far better condition).  Anyone reading reviews of this product probably doesn't need to have Clayton Moore's TV episodes recommended to them, though I certainly will second any such recommendation.  I would only like to add that the Lone Ranger movie serial, despite the poor quality of the film master and the differences from the TV version, is likewise very much worth viewing, and that Mill Creek Entertainment has presented it here in the most watchable form that I, at least, have ever seen, and at a really remarkable bargain price, even if the TV episodes were not also included.  I think this is a must-have, and a must-see, for any real dyed-in-the-wool Lone Ranger fan.

ADDENDUM: I guess it's high time I add to the review itself what I'd already  added in a Comment: while the Mill Creek DVD release remains a bargain for what it is, if you want to see the original 1938 Lone Ranger movie serial in the most watchable form available in nearly 80 years, the edition you REALLY want is the one restored for the Serial Squadron by Eric Stedman.

3030431,5,B000YJOGDE,"Got out this set from its honored place in my DVD collection and re-viewed it yesterday while at home nursing a sprained ankle. What a great way to give yourself some ""R & R"" !!!!

  The Lone Ranger was always a superb television series, but the addition of color near the end of the series' run was a great idea on the part of producer Jack Wrather...and a shrewd

set-up for the upcoming feature film productions. And when Wrather went to color, he did it right. Some of the color work on the last seasons of ""The Adventures of Superman"" was uneven, but Wrather's ""Lone Ranger"" and ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon""

shows were photographed gorgeously. The colors in this Ranger collection are vivid and eye-catching.

The stories and acting hold up well, too. When LR creator Geo. Trendle first began shooting this series (as ""Apex Film Corp."")in 1949, he had Clayton Moore act somewhat wooden and stiff (Trendle's idea of ""stoic & heroic"") and directed him to use

perfect diction in the delivering of his lines. After Wrather took over in 1954 this loosened up a bit and allowed Moore a

bit more leeway in his interpretation of the masked Mr. John Reid. Moore took the opportunity to infuse more and more of himself into the Ranger (while still using good grammar) and the meld became so perfect that the two---the actor and the character---virtually became one (as was also the case with William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy and Duncan Renaldo as the Cisco Kid).

Jay Silverheels likewise had become the quintessential Tonto.

The three-episodes-a-week shooting schedules used in those days (for a half-hour show it could be done, but the pace was exhausting)

result in something one notices immediately in this collection---wherein episodes can be watched back to back; that being that the same actors can often be seen(sometimes in the same costumes) over and over again. In one show a young would-be

Sheriff is helped by the Ranger and Tonto to rid a mining town of bullying outlaws, and, the next thing you know, this same young fellow (now wearing a stick-on mustache) is a deputy town marshal , helping the Ranger help the blinded chief marshal get back his hope for living. And one of the baddies from the previous episode is in this one as well, wearing the same clothes. When you watched these on t.v. years ago...shown a week apart...and often out of shooting sequence...you didn't catch this sort of thing. Only now can you see how they worked this and it gives you a greater appreciation of how much inventiveness and ingenuity went into these rush-job productions.

Clayton Moore's principle stuntman, Bill Ward, shows his stuff to good effect in these episodes. Ward was great at ""ape-ing""

Clayton Moore's carraige and body language and this makes the

doubling much more effective and exciting. Ward...not that well known compared to other Hollywood stunt stars like Yakima Canutt,Dave Sharpe,Tom Steele, or Dale Van Sickle...was, nevertheless, wonderful at his trade. In his athleticism, agility, and coordination, Ward was strikingly similar to Dave Sharpe in his stuntwork. In fact, for a long time this reviewer believed that the fabulous ""bulldogging"" stunt at the end of the 1956 Warner Brothers theatrical movie ""The Lone Ranger"" was DONE by David Sharpe (an awesome leap from Silver, coming up from behind stuntman Bob Morgan...doubling ""baddie' Robert Wilke...followed by a tremendous rolling fistfight down a steep hillside). This ""gag"" had all the athletic earmarks of Sharpe, but in his book ""I Was That Masked Man"", Clayton Moore reveals that it was, in fact, Bill Ward wearing the mask in that amazing sequence. All Ranger fans owe it to themselves to see this great western and to marvel at the climactic fight, but Ward is on his game in this television collection as well, and does a bang-up job of providing exciting physical action on the Ranger's part.

One of the hallmarks of the entire Lone Ranger saga, on radio, in the movies, and on television, was its respect for the American Indians and their cultures. This respect is there in all the Clayton Moore productions, to be sure. This is quite true in an episode called ""Ghost Canyon"", where cowboy baddies try to crook a local tribe out of their heard of horses. They do this with assistance of the chief's ""nephew"", the only ""bad"" Indian around. Turns out, though, that the ""nephew"" is a fake,

a half-breed ex-con who doesn't really have an Indian heart or soul after all. He has killed the real nephew and taken his place.

This set is enclosed in a ""saddlebag"" package by Rhino Video that is pretty nifty and attractive. It is a good buy for the money, great nostalgia, and just good old fashioned storytelling

about the kind of hero/role-model for young people that we see

FAR too little of today.",1152576000,,4798,4.842298288508557

THE LONE RANGER CREED (Disc Two)

Written by Fran Striker.

Clayton Moore was a circus acrobat at the age of eight and grew up in the Midwest (Illinois)...worked in the circus and traveled to New York and then Hollywood where he became a stuntman and bit player...inducted into the ""Stuntman's Hall of Fame"" in 1982...also received the ""Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame'"" also the ""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum"" both in 1990...Clayton was once quoted ""Playing him [the Lone Ranger] made me a better person."", ""Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn't want any other. I was playing the good guy.""...""I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky."" (On his costume as the Lone Ranger, February 4, 1985)...Clayton very much enjoyed quoting and lived by ""A Ranger's Creed"" which included this moral lesson ""That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and light it himself.""

As such, including the first episode would probably seem out of place.  It is available in several other DVD releases, including the AMC first 14 episodes 2-disc set and in a dvd that combines the first 3 episodes into a movie of the origin of the Lone Ranger, each of which sell on Amazon for $9.99.

The final few seasons were intentionally (so far as I could surmise) filmed in color.  Again, if this is a selling point, purchase a set containing earlier episodes and you will be able to see the Lone Ranger in his B&W glory.

This period in the series contains some classic episodes, and the production quality of these later episodes is quite good compared to earlier years.  I think most fans of the masked man would not be disappointed with this set.",1117238400,,1007,4.592178770949721

Who ever thought back in 1931 a small Detroit radio station two men John Kunsky and George W. Trendle would be the start of our hero...later Trendle asked writer Fran Striker to develop a character that was sort of a Robin Hood and Zorro, thus The Lone Ranger was born and the very first broadcast January 31, 1933, America came to love and embrace this legendary lawman...then in 1949 Moore and Silverheels worked together in a film called ""The Cowboy and the Indians"", this was just the beginning of a long working friendship between to wonderful actors and human beings.

Every week in front of the tube the announcer would open with...""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger""...then the Masked Man would ride in and we would hear...""With his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early West! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! The Lone Ranger rides again""...we would sit glued to the TV and ride those dusty trails with our hero with plenty of action coming our way...so tighten up those cinches and get ready to ride.

All 19 episodes were beautifully remastered in color and restored...the Ranger films were always first class and the early years had some of the best of the best...they need to be out there for all of us who loved and looked up to Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels...both actors gave their characters life, their word was bond...never quit on a friend in need, always giving the other fellow an even break...this was the way of the early West...the code they lived by, they'll never be another Lone Ranger and Tonto!

This is truly fun stuff and even today holds up as a great western adventure...original airdate was from September 1956 thru January 1957...he was our hero & now once again because of film preservation this restored digital DVD Box Set we can escape to the old west...Great package and family entertainment...just the way it should be!

They should have included in the box set how the Lone Ranger(LR) became the LR namely the 1st episode. They might have assumed your not interested in this, or they couln't make it happen, for this set, contractually. Finally, they edited the opening theme scene, 2nd half, by deleting the naration the begins something like: ""Return to.... the days of old...."". They also edited out the visual of the LR & Silver riding down the 2nd half of the canyon trail which of course went with the naration.

Some months ago I had purchased a 2 DVD pack with 12 episodes of the first season of the Lone Ranger. {Platinum Disc Corp}

Well, almost. They're a few out of sequence, but I won't sweat the small stuff! I was very surprised at the print quality of most of the 12, and it has the first three episodes that intoduce the Ranger & Tonto. I got such a kick out of seeing these again, and so many memories flooded back in from those hours spent sitting in front of our 17"" black&white Admiral t.v. on Saturday mornings of 1950's in Southern California, whew, that I had to have MORE! Thus this purcahse! The colors great like the other fellow says, and clean good prints! What makes this different besides the color {and the last season of the show as well} of these episodes is the different locations that are used in just about every episode. Oh, yeah...Corriganville, Ivereson Ranch and the Susana Hills or 'Mts' if ya like are present in many, but you'll also go to Kanab, Utah. Columbia State Park in Central Ca. near Fresno. And outside of the Utah shots, my favorite; the Lone Pine Ca. location with the snow capped Sierras and the Alabama Hills as a back drop! WOW! I was a bit reluctant to plop down the $$  but I found a good deal at Fry's or Best Buy! Sorry Amazon old pal! But when I got home and started playing the dvd's I was really happy I made this purchase! ITS FUN! How many things do we buy any more that are FUN? Continuing onward; you'll have 19 episodes all in order of the airing dates of the last season. From Sept. 13th. 1956 thru Jan 17th. 1957. That leaves 20 episodes still remaining to be stamped into DVD's! {I hope}for the remainder of the 57' season, which ended 6-6-57. Yes, you read that right!! 39 episodes in a t.v. season! As was the common practice of t.v shows back in the day! Now, we are lucky to see our favorite program before a November air date, and end in March? But I ramble. If ya realy want to go a little further with a Lone Ranger Rush, read Clayton Moore's book; ""I Was That Masked Man"" other wise ""return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. Out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver. The Lone Ranger rides again!""",1091664000,,2462,4.324675324675325

3030449,5,B000YJOGDE,"VCI Entertainment and Warner Brothers have given us all a real gem here, in this greatest of all Lone Ranger movies, and, likely the capstone to Clayton Moore's career in the movies and television. Not only is this 1956 Warners production considered the best Lone Ranger story ever lensed---for the big screen OR the small---but it is considered by many film historians and aficionados around the world to be one of the best WESTERNS ever made...up there with some nifty John Wayne , John Ford, and Howard Hawks vehicles.

The color cinematography in TLR is glorious and the greens, rusts, blues, and every other color on the Warnercolor pallet

comes across vividly. This is just a scenically gorgeous movie to watch.

Stuart Heisler's direction here is sure-handed and solid and the screenplay is engrossing. And while TLR is not an ADULT adult western like, say, ""High Noon"", it is well above the level of the stereotypical ""kid's B-Picture"" as well. This is something with some meat and maturity to it, more along the lines of, say. Errol Flynn's ""Dodge City"" than a Saturday matinee Gene Autry oater. (Indeed, the narrative prolog for

TLR utilises stock footage of cattle drive and wagon train scenes FROM ""Dodge City"").

The cast is superb. Moore and Silverheels are definitive, as usual, and Michael Ansara gives a strong performance as an Indian warrior (and contributes to a great ""special features"" recollection as well, as does Bonita Granville). Lyle Bettger turns in one of his great patented oily villain portrayals as Reece Kilgore, greedy, power-hungry cattle baron trying to drive a tribe of Indians off their reservation so as to gain access to the large silver deposits he has discovered inside their venerated Spirit Mountain. Robert Wilke is equally evil as Cassidy , Kilgore's foreman and chief gunman. Wilke was one of the great villains of the 50s and 60s in movie and tv westerns, and, if you can't place him by name, he was Capt. Nemo's (James Mason's) burly first mate in Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".

The musical score to the film is excellent as well, with the talented David Buttolph doing first rate orchestrations of the William Tell Overture and numerous incidental background themes . One of these themes Buttolph uses in the film is quite interesting. In a scene where the Lone Ranger has secretly met with the territorial governor at a mission church, the two of them walk out from the mission talking and the the Lone Ranger mounts Silver and rides away with Tonto. Playing lightly in the background on the soundtrack is a jaunty little melody that, within a year's time or so, will evolve into the theme for t.v.'s ""Maverick"".

Some people who watch this film today seem amazed at how much respect for American Indians and their cultures are shown in it. This are obviously ""johnny-come-latelies"" to the Lone Ranger mythos, for anybody with ANY familiarity AT ALL with Lone Ranger media knows that Indians were ALWAYS treated with respect in all LR scripts , be they movie, radio, or television  scripts. In fact, it could well be argued that the Lone Ranger adventures were historically pivotal in showing the ""OTHER side of the coin"" re: Cowboy & Indian interaction in the old west.

Another great aspect of watching this movie is that you get to see ""The Stunt"", followed by ""The Fight"". Say what?, you ask.

Well, its like this; Clayton Moore's principle stunt double was a first-rate stuntman named Bill Ward . Ward was both a superlative rider (all scenes of TLR doing hair-raising rides or jumps on Silver are done by Ward, who was also Silver's ""wrangler"") and a great fight participant to boot. In this latter capacity, Bill Ward's agility, coordination, and overall athleticism was strikingly similar to that of the legendary David Sharpe (who, along with Yakima Canutt & Tom Steel, was considered the ""best in the business"" in the 30s, 40s, and into the fifties). When this reviewer first saw the end of this movie again some years ago, I believed absolutely that ""The Stunt"" had to have been done BY Dave Sharpe; thought he was the only one crazy enough, or agile enough, to have done it. But I was wrong. Ward did it. Clayton Moore says so in his autobiography.

So what IS this ""stunt"" I'm talking about? In Hollywood stunt parlance there was a ""gag"" called ""bulldogging"" that was done in B pictures so often it became almost a cliche. Derived from rodeo bulldogging, where a cowboy has to leap from his horse, grab a bull/steer around the neck and wrestle him to the ground, movie stunt ""bulldogging"" involved pursuit of the baddie by the stunt double of Roy, Gene, Hoppy, or whomever...at the end of which time Trigger, Champion, Topper (or whomever) would pull alongside the bad-guy's horse and

the good guy would dive across to the other guy's horse and pull that rider out of the saddle. Both would hit the ground and, after a brief exchange of blows, the good guy would punch the outlaw's lights out.

It was decided that the Robert Wilke character, ""Cassidy"", was going to try to ""make his break"" at the film's end, and that the Ranger would run him down on Silver and ""bulldog"" him. But the producer wanted something better than the standard old I've-seen-this-a-hundred-times bulldogging. He wanted something different and spectacular...and his stunt crew gave it to him. Bill Ward and Bob Morgan (who later lost a leg doubling George Peppard on the railroad logging car sequence in ""How The West Was Won"")came up with what is considered the greatest movie bulldogging stunt of all time. It has never been bested.

The stunt works this way: Ward is the Lone Ranger, in pursuit of Bob Morgan, who is doubling Robert Wilke. Morgan is skirting the edge of a steep ridge (the same ridge Ward and ""Tonto"" come charging down at the opening of the movie), Ward comes right into him from behind and from the side. He does NOT come directly alongside Morgan, but, instead, in an EXTREMELY dangerous move, LAUNCHES himself from the saddle from BEHIND Bob Morgan and literally FLIES through the air (no wire, no net, no CGI...no NOTHING) to grab Morgan and jerk him off his mount. THIS is ""the stunt"", and it remains awesome to this day.

""The fight"" follows ""the stunt"" immediately and the editing of the two is seamless. It is a rolling, slugging, tumbling fist fight that continues all the way to the bottom of this steep draw. The cross-cuts of Moore fighting Wilke and Ward fighting Morgan are excellent, and the totality of this entire sequence...from the bulldogging through the downhill fight...is just awesome. It is something no one who has ever seen this movie ever forgets.

I'd advise you to treat yourself to it as well. This is one humdinger of a western from start to finish, and if you are someone who loves colorful action and adventure in your cinema diet, then don't miss this one.

And yes, it ends just like you know it should:

  ""But, Padre, I wanted to see his face...to learn his name!""

  ""You cannot see his face. He will wear his mask until his

  work is done. And, as for his name...he is The Lone Ranger.""

  ""HI-YO SILVER!!! AWAY!!""

  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!",1069027200,,7147,4.785365853658536
3030450,5,B000YJOGDE,"VCi's offering of the 1956 Lone Ranger feature film is outsatnding. Prior to this, I had to watch my old VHS EP Mode version and it was not pleasant. It never is with EP mode products.  The VCi copy is clear and crisp with brilliant and vibrant colors, the way a DVD rendition of classic film should be. Despite the Region 1 tag, it is an all regions DVD and all Lone Rnager fans around the world will have the chance to enjoy this one. This is the best Lone Ranger film of all times as the production values are top notch. The sequel - The Lost City of Gold pales in comparison as somewhat akin to a made for TV movie. That must also be had to complete the cinema presenations of the Lone Ranger. The 1980's feature ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is an aberration, nice to see but not to collect.

3030451,5,B000YJOGDE,"Even though I have been a Lone Ranger fan since the 50's, I was surprised that I had never seen the first three television episodes from 1949. I don't recall ever seeing any of these in syndication. I was also surprised at how good they were- actually better than many of the later episodes.

 These three shows explain everything that I was curious about as a kid: the origin of the Lone Ranger, Where Tonto came from, how he found Silver, the meaning of the silver bullets, the vow to never shoot to kill.... It is all there, everything I wondered about as a boy.

 I supposed some people will consider the dialog and the acting to be old fashion. I ,however, liked the fact that the actors took the ideals of the show seriously (justice, law, order, decency, fairness and good) There is no tongue-in-check ""spoofing"" or laughing at these ideals.

I have both of those, and I would recommend ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" because it has superior quality to ""Legend of the Lone Ranger.""  However, ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" does have one scene that for some reason ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" doesn't have, so maybe you'll want to get both.

I used to watch them them on the old black and white TV with the doors on it,(lol) back then,  and wow, now in color!  Being older now too, I have more admiration for his physique too. So a whole new admiration. I just read that Clayton Moore was an acrobat prior to his acting career. There will never be another for the role, unlike the James Bond or Batman movies. UZ Clayton Moore loyalists just won't care to go see anyone else. Just as we stood behind him when they wouldn't let him wear the mask.

3264666,4,B000YJOGDE,"Holds up pretty well after all these years. The villains represent all the same forces of evil--greed, racism, patriarchythat we can still recognize and need to defeat, and the problems of frontier territories are still an issue in those exact same backwards fly-over states. We are paying the price yet today for our national heritage of genocide and slavery, so those overtones are still quite relevant. The only thing that's a bit dated is the concept that there is some EFFECTIVE crusader for truth, justice and human dignity roaming among us working to hold our villains to account.

We still believed in that model of a better world within the first decades after the war, but since the Reagan era we know better. I grew up in So. Calif. and took weekend excursions to the same desert/foothill locations that Hollywood used for these archetypal movies, so we kids always felt close to the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy, but once we grew up and fell under the spell of the western charm of a right-wing ideologue movie star, the chances of finding a masked crusader with multi-cultural influences dropped out of the popular imagination.

3264753,2,B000YJOGDE,"Earlier this century I owned THE LONE RANGER special edition from VCI Video which contained the 1956 LONE RANGER movie with both the full screen and widescreen options. I mean the whole point of the movie was for the TV shows fans to get out of the house and into movie theaters to see their favorite hero both In Color and in Widescreen. What kid and some parents could resist such an offering?!

Being a baby-boomer fan of the TV show, I enjoyed seeing Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels in widescreen color so much that I loaned out the DVD to friends until it did not come back.  Once I realized that this edition of the clear quill LONE RANGER was missing from my collection, I went to Amazon to find a replacement.

First I tried the LONE RANGER double bill which included The City of Gold as well. Both films were Fullscreen. The widescreen version from VCI Entertainment is no longer in their catalog which could explain the $35 - $105 price through Amazon.

But seeing the above image, I thought that I had found a widescreen version once more. But no.  The sealed DVD which I ordered from an Amazon vendor had a different package image clearly listed as Fullscreen on the back. I gave it another shot because of the image above and ordered the full-priced official Amazon DVD. Today I received the full priced DVD with the same packaging as that of the vendor DVD. It seems to me that Amazon should specifically list this edition of THE LONE RANGER as Fullscreen only with the actual packaging image on the DVD being sold.

I regret that the 1981 Klinton Spilsbury and the 1913 Armie Hammer Lone Rangers are the only forgettable ones that we can see in widescreen. Neither film brings back those thrilling days of yesteryear touted on radio and TV. I regret that the 1981 and 1913 versions of the Lone Ranger are probably blocking the re-release  of Clayton Moores iconic and favorite Lone Ranger film in widescreen. Clayton Moore could actually act as he demonstrates in several of the Lone Ranger's disguises. He had earned his chops not only on the TV in the 50s, but as the villains chief henchman in several of the best Republic Saturday serials in the 40s. Warner Brothers or VCI Entertainment should re-release it. Either way, I'd buy The widescreen 1956 Lone Ranger were Amazon to offer it at a reasonable price.",1412553600,,2329,4.597590361445783

3264759,5,B000YJOGDE,"From an origin episode which talks about the Cavendish gang and finding Silver to a full color episode from the final season, this collection represents the series well. A few episodes feature hard-to-find samples of the season which had John Hart replace Clayton Moore. That is a well-rounded survey.
The true debate about who played the Lone Ranger better should skip the two recent movie exploitation disasters and begin with radio's Brace Beemer. Clayton Moore found it difficult to step into Beemer's magnificent voice. But television won out. John Hart played the Lone Ranger with a bit less of a stilted manner than Moore, but the public seems not to have accepted him. Moore was brought back for the remainder of the series.
This collection permits today's viewer to see both television actors who played the masked rider as well as an episode filmed in glorious color before there was color television.
Incidentally, for comic book fans, the traditional comic strip and early comic books had the masked man wearing black pants and a splendid red shirt. Television filming seemed to require the silly light bluework uniform some of us came to hate. The final indignity of that day was when the Dell comic books switched to the television blues.
So, return to those days of yesteryear and enjoy the variety of this disc. Whether an old-timer looking back or a younger historian making discovery, this is enough for Lone Ranger 1, a rewarding non-credit course. Enjoy.",1409011200,,1474,4.97165991902834
3264760,4,B000YJOGDE,"The Lone Ranger is one of those iconic characters that have left a significant mark in pop culture history. Even for those unfamiliar with the old radio show, movie serials, the famous television series, comics, or movies, most people still recognize his catchphrase, Hi-Yo, Silver! Much like Zorro or other heroes created in the early 20th century, hes resonated with fans of all ages for his bravery and simple ideals of heroism. Hes one of the classic archetypes for heroes, standing for truth, justice, and the American way even before Superman did.

His television series ran from 1949 to 1957, being the first televised western and building on the characters substantial popularity at the time. It starred Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as the two leads, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, and was such a success that two feature length films were released as part of the canon. The first was simply titled, The Lone Ranger.

The movie opens with a brief intro narration establishing the west as a place for hardened pioneers and a very harsh lifestyle. Out of this came a legendary hero. Cue the music, roll the credits. Even the sound of William Tell Overture brings to mind this lighthearted and unrelentingly noble character as he sits tall atop a white horse. After that, the characters begin a new adventure.

Theres little setup to the heroes, forsaking a retelling of his origin for a bigger scale plotline. They gloss over it a one point, but such backstories hardly mattered for the pulp heroes. The movie plays out like a lengthier episode of the show, but with full color and a larger budget to tell the story. The story is of a greedy land owner who has his sights set on a large mountain in the territory. The only problem is that the mountain is part of the Native Americans reservation, and they have a stable peace treaty with the ranchers. Thats when natives begin suddenly stealing and killing cattle for no reason, prompting the ranchers to want the natives relocated or eliminated altogether. Enter the Lone Ranger.

The story of race conflict and deception for motives of greed is a common one from the series, but here its given more time to build and a lot more thrills than the television show was capable of producing. Whether its Tonto fighting alone against an entire towns lynch mob or the Lone Ranger shooting a stick of dynamite out of the air as its thrown at him, there are some genuinely exciting moments. The plot is revealed slowly as it unravels piece by piece, but its nothing terribly complicated or groundbreaking. Like I said, it has a familiar feel to it for anyone who watched the show, but the action and scale make up for this.

Clayton Moore is perfect as the hero, it being a character he portrayed for over thirty years, and its clear by how natural he looks and acts with the mask. His face is never shown, either always covered by the mask or make-up when hes in disguise as a wily old prospector. The same quality and naturalness is true for Jay Silverheels as Tonto, whos given a significant and exciting action sequence all to himself in this story. Although all the Native Americans, including Tonto, speak in the clich&eacute;d pidgin English, they are not depicted badly. Its just a product of its time. Tonto is always shown to be a capable and honorable character, whose altruism equally matches the Lone Rangers. The other natives are also portrayed by Native American actors and given clear motivations and characters.

One of the major conflicts in the movie is that the ranchers are violating the peace treaty and wanting to push them further off their lands (this not being the first time), and this makes some of the natives agree that war is the correct path. It will end in slaughter, but its better to die than be treated so poorly. Its a sympathetic plight and something both heroes desperately want to prevent.

The first Lone Ranger movie is surprisingly good and a fun western. It has some great stunts and really good action scenes, but best of all it captures the classic nature of an iconic hero.",1408492800,,4071,4.709269662921348

This one hour feature is  a special that was created in 1955 for the 22nd Anniversary of the program (22 years includes the radio program years) using the first three episodes of the TV series from 1949 edited together, that provide the answers to the origin of The Lone Ranger. An all new opening (for 1955) was created to introduce the Anniversary special as well as a special ending. This TV special was aired again in 1958 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary.  Good Times Home Video used to release these great previously unavailable films and specials, but they vanished after the era of VHS bit the dust. It is an extremely welcome return via DVD's from Legend Films that some (so far) have reappeared on the home video market.

3264804,5,B000YJOGDE,"I grew up watching reruns of Clayton Moore's ""Lone Ranger"" TV show. When I recently watched the full length movie, I was concerned that it would be like other converted TV series, and lose a step. To the contrary. It holds up, carrying all of the drama, majesty and heroics of the original.

The plot is simple: the bad guy wants to control a silver lode by causing Indians (who own it) to be vanquished in a battle built on false accusations. The Lone Ranger's job, with trusty Tonto, is to stop it.

How will go is somewhat predictable. You know the good guys will win. That's the grandness of the movie: despite knowing, you love it. I did. It is good old fashioned Saturday afternoon movie watching. Break open the popcorn.

Clayton Moore is, of course, ""The Lone Ranger."" Any other actor in his debt for perfecting the role. Here, he does not disappoint.

There's a good message in there about racial harmony and true, not vigilante, justice.

I fully recommend, ""The Lone Ranger.""

3264811,2,B000YJOGDE,We thought it would be fun to watch an old Lone Ranger movie like we saw as kids.  It was crazy watching this movie.  The acting was silly...and to think we used to take this stuff seriously when we were kids.  How funny.  This walk down memory lane was definitely not worth our time.,1380931200,,284,4.203703703703703

3264815,5,B000YJOGDE,A treasure of information on the background and values of the Masked Man known as The Lone Ranger!  Neither of the last two movies understood his values and commitment to justice! The first three episodes of the TV series which began in 1949  should be a must see for any future remakes of a movie on this character and crime fighter:-),1379721600,,336,4.491803278688525

First heard on the radio and then first seen in 1949, the Lone Ranger is currently alive and well and living on DVD and found on Amazon.com.  The episodes continue to entertain new generations of television viewers.  It was never necessary for Hollywood to remake this legendary TV show.  Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels will always be known as The Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Personally, I'm very glad that they remain part of the American conscience. I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD or the accompanying DVD entitled The Lone Ranger: Hi-Yo Silver, Away!",1377043200,,751,4.928571428571429

3264823,3,B000YJOGDE,"We just saw the new movie ""The Lone Ranger"".  It was very good.  The major problem that I had was that it was too tongue and cheek in some of the dialog.  The music was very good esp in the last half hour.  The movie is supposed to take place in 1869 before and during the time that the railroads were joined.  During the joining a band was playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever"".  The only problem with that is that tune was not penned until 1896! Also they played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". In most important events of that era ""Hail Columbia"" or ""My Country Tis of Thee"" were played.  You would think that the person in charge of the music would have realized the error.  Other then those minor problems the movie was good.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1374537600,,761,4.229166666666667
3264824,5,B000YJOGDE,"It's been decades since I've seen a Lone Ranger Episode and I am not disappointed. There have been some complaints about this DVD being issued in 1:33. What those viewers probably don't understand is that this was the early days of wide screen film. Prints were issued in 1:33 because not all movie houses had the correct lenses to show all formats. Some were still showing 1:33 others could show 1:85 some 1:66. So the producers issued the films ""full frame"" (no hard matting) so that each house could show it how it was able to, using as much of the frame as they needed to. The film was printed ""full frame"". Later on they started hard matting the picture so there was no option but to show it 1:85 and by that time movie houses had the lenses they needed.

This works the same with this DVD. You can show it full frame (1:33) but it shows fine ""zoomed in"" to 1:75 (wide screen TV) try it. We just watched this film in ""zoom mode"" (so it filled the screen horizontally) and it played fine.

The video is not restored but it didn't bother me. I wish they would make movies with a good moral message, like this one, again.",1374105600,,1123,4.317535545023697
3264825,5,B000YJOGDE,I have all the lone ranger espisodes and movies so I bought this one for my son . The next generation  of Lone ranger fans,1374105600,,122,3.88
3264826,5,B000YJOGDE,"I am a long time Lone Ranger fan.  I watched the first episodes when they were first on TV for the very first time.  This DVD is excellent!  It should not be marked down because it is not in color.  The color one does not seem to exist.  The DVD case does not say it is in color---some seller made the listing and that seller put down that it is in color.  We are rating the film for quality of picture & sound ---not some error on the listing.

It is common to list older TV shows as being 30 minutes in length when we all know that there are commercials that reduce the actual show time.  Although the DVD case says 90 minutes, we all know better.  In addition, the openings & closings of the film take time away from the actual story.  This DVD shows all 3 shows as if it was only one show.  It could have been shown in a theatre.  There is only one opening and one closing for the entire DVD.  This also shortens the run time.  I am quite sure that the opening & closing is probably slightly shorter than the original ones. These probably were modified for rerun purposes.

All in all, you will be very please with this product.  I am very familiar with Westlake Entertainment and they always do a first class job.",1374019200,,1218,4.163090128755365
3264827,5,B000YJOGDE,I've been a Lone Ranger fan since age 5 or 6.  This tin and the episodes bring back good memories of getting up early to watch the show with my Sister.,1373932800,,151,3.870967741935484
3264828,5,B000YJOGDE,It brought back wonderful memories.  I had just watched and enjoyed the new Lone Ranger.  This movie seems to be the inspiration for that movie.,1373932800,,144,4.72
3264829,3,B000YJOGDE,Half way decient quality but does not appear to be remastered.  Watching on a small screen would be more toerable (in my opinion).,1373587200,,130,4.6521739130434785
3264830,5,B000YJOGDE,"Loved this movie, lots of action and laughs. Both Johnny Depp,love his looks, and Armie Hammer are the best!! Don't care for critics!!",1373414400,,134,4.869565217391305
3264831,5,B000YJOGDE,"I'm old enough to remember what was referred to in the old show as ""those thrilling days of yesteryear..."".  I always enjoyed the old Lone Ranger show.  BUT that was some pretty straight laced stuff.  The old Lone Ranger and his trustee sidekick were not funny people.  I don't recall ever once seeing them laugh, or making me laughing in response to any of their material.  They were just a couple of do-gooder's who helped folks out every week.  Such a dry format could never work in today's savvy viewer market.
The current Lone Ranger is cheesy, it's campy, it's engaging, and it's filled with lots of humor.  While not being a comedy per se, it is filled with enough light hearted humor to make it a FUN movie to watch.  Is it slow, as I've heard accused?  I didn't think so.  I thought the pace was pretty good.  I didn't feel it was too long either -- about right.
I have watched the media trash this movie, and frankly I can't understand what their motive is.  This is a charming movie with a familiar plot that is well done enough to engage the audiences.  Case in point -- my audience all applauded at the end of the show.
As far as the cast goes -- this show isn't just dominated by Johnny Depp. Both lead characters are very strong and likable.
Before going, I read four different reviews of this movie -- all terrible -- and almost DIDN'T go see it based on them.  What a mistake that would have been, as The Lone Ranger turned out to be one of the best movie experiences I've had this year.  DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD OF THE CRITICS ON THIS ONE.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE FOR YOURSELF!!",1373414400,,1590,4.303030303030303
3264832,1,B000YJOGDE,"I was expecting something exciting, new, enthralling- well, basically entertaining. How could it go wrong? It's Johnny Depp! It's the Lone Ranger- the mask, Silver the wonder horse, The William Tell overture! Well, I was ready to go back to the concession stand about at the 30 minute mark. then, I did not mind the restroom breaks- didn't even have to wait for some ""unimportant two minutes part- they seemed to all be unimportant parts! Finally, about at the 1 hr, 45 min mark, I found myself wondering if I should just leave- I had had quite enough. As for the Lone Ranger- the writers decided, apparently, he would just treat the ""wizened Sage"" Tonto as a three year old child. Huh? Tonto was the maker of the Lone Ranger- the man's savior! And a loyal and equal side kick- And, for Tonto- Who at Disney dreamed up the outrageous costume - did they go to Africa? Perhaps back from Dogon Ceremonial Mask collection? Toltec Sacrificial Masks? Or did they just pick something from a clown makeup catalogue and toss in a few turkey feathers. Actually, placing black *'s or +'s over Depp's eyes might have enlivened it, giving the audience something to get a chuckle out of- any emotion would have sufficed! I tried to enjoy it. I made every excuse. I even tried reverting back to my child hood mind set to imagine the time in my life when I idolized the moralistic, brace, manly, talented Lone Ranger. He stood for something I grew up trying to emulate- But, this movie just defeated every effort and I was one of the first to get out of the theater near the ending...I had seen enough. What a waste of 2.5 hours of my life!",1373328000,,1624,4.508474576271187
3264833,2,B000YJOGDE,"this movie is a real bad movie, if you are looking for real action please look some where else, this movie is not it, Johnny need his but kick for even allowing this movie to be made. I was looking for some Clint Eastwood story not here,",1373328000,,237,4.0638297872340425
3264834,5,B000YJOGDE,"I saw the original Lone Ranger with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels a few times on TV when I was a tyke.  To me, the William Tell Overture is synonymous with The Lone Ranger.  Despite the horrible reviews of this current movie four of us went to see it.  I was prepared for the worst and found myself totally engaged in the movie.  Sure it was hokey and unrealistic in many parts but so are so many other movies that get 5 star reviews.  This movie has everything - drama, suspense, comedy, fight scenes, bad men, etc.  This 2+ hour movie was over before I knew it. I enjoyed it and so did two of the other people I went with.  The fourth said it was a lot better than expected.  For anyone, including baby boomers, who did not know how The Lone Ranger became the masked man, the movie explains how it all came about.

I've read and heard  a lot of criticism about Johnny Depp as Tonto.  In my opinion he did an amazing job portraying Tonto.  He put his own spin on the character and made it his own.  The lines between The Lone Ranger and Tonto are very clever.

There was a lot of joyful laughter in the movie theater when we saw this film.  So, don't believe the critics.  Judge it for yourself.  You just might be extremely pleasantly surprised like I was.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, young and old alike.",1373328000,,1324,4.248995983935743
3264835,4,B000YJOGDE,"We went and saw this film today and it was Hilarious! Johnny Depp is right in character and Army Hammer portrayed the Lone Ranger in classic Clayton Moore style. The movie takes the time to set the scenes and introduce the viewers to what is to come. This movie was not meant to be a documentary or even a novel like ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Lincoln"". It's fun and entertaining. It is told from the view point of ""Tonto"" and how he helps to lead to Lone Ranger (Army Hammer)"" to realize his destiny. I would recommend seeing it. Don't expect anything but a very amusing and entertaining time at the movies.  I don't know what the ""Critics"" are talking about. If they keep comparing Johnny Depp's future films to ""Pirates"", they will never appreciate anything else he does. ""Pirates"" is a Johnny Depp trade mark which will live forever. However, he should not be ""Type Casted"" in this roll and everything he does afterwards fails in comparison. This simply is NOT the case. It is easy for those on the outside to criticize, but they are NOT Actor's and if they were put in this position, would have no clue on how to transition from one roll to another. GO SEE IT and judge for yourself. Don't let these reviews cloud your own judgement.",1373328000,,1235,4.464601769911504

3264837,4,B000YJOGDE,"Don't usually agree with critics when they bring down a movie and this time was no different.  This is a fun movie which had us laughing out loud.  The scenery was awesome and the characters heart-felt and so enjoyable.  Please don't be afraid to see it because of the 2 hr. 30 min. run.  The time went so fast, we were disappointed when it was over.  With that said, we hope to see it again, especially while it is still on the big screen.  This type of movie would be lost on TV, but then again, we might watch it again when it is available there as well.  Go - have fun - laugh and listen carefully for all the little comments that are so special and unique to all the characters, especially Johnny.  We would recommend it highly.",1373328000,,733,4.223021582733813
3264838,5,B000YJOGDE,"Johnny Depp's Tonto and Armie Hammer's Ranger characters interplay are priceless and make this movie one of the funniest movies I've seen.  The plot is entertaining, the excitement is ongoing, but the interaction between the main characters is beyond description.  I hope to see this movie again before it leaves theatres because the quips were so continual that I'm sure I missed some the first time around.  I wasn't bored for one iota of a second and was totally immersed in the action for the entire 2+ hours.  I loved this movie!!!!",1373241600,,537,4.804347826086956

The works are amazingly clear given the age of the original series, and the sound quality was well done. I found no problems with watching them, except to get them away from my husband long enough to check them out for a review.

It is interesting that this isn't a single united series, but rather a selection of favorites from the series. Husband is happy, so is his wife.

The music was changed from the William Tell Overtures to music that was presented on other shows of this period, however, it doesn't detract from the value of the show. Recommended.!

Undoubtedly our parents watched the originals, but like anything, it was new to us and we loved them anyway. We didn't have a color television set and these nostalgic selections do bring back memories.

It was serious stuff when Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto) hit the little screen. There's not a lot of analyzing to do about this series because most kids I know simply loved the duo. If you like oldies, but goodies, you'll love this sampling.  Note that during Season 3, John Hart played the Lone Ranger, but Clayton Moore returns during Season 4.

I have such fond memories of humming the tune from the soundtrack featuring The William Tell Overture and despite being a girl, quite enjoyed the pair's adventures through the wild west.

This DVD (I was provided a review copy by the seller), ""The Lone Ranger: Hi-Yo Silver Away!"" features eight random episodes:

The Lone Ranger Fights On (Season One, original airdate Sep 22, 1949, B&W)
Outlaw of the Plains (Season One, original airdate July 6, 1950, B&W)
Mr. Trouble (Season 2, original airdate March 8, 1951, B&W)
The Brown Pony (Season 3, original airdate May 14, 1953, B&W)
The Old Cowboy (Season 3, original airdate June 25, 1953, B&W)
The Midnight Rider (Season 3, original airdate July 16, 1953, B&W)
Trapped (Season 4, original airdate August 4, 1955, B&W)
Quarter Horse War (Season 5, original airdate November 8, 1956, Color)

Note: In Season 3, John Hart replaces Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger before Moore returns in Seasons 4 and 5. Season 5 was filmed in color.

The total running time is approx. 200 minutes. There is no Closed Caption/Subtitle option which would have been nice for the hearing-impaired. The sound quality is clear and the image is also crisp given the show's age. This would make a nice gift for a Lone Ranger fan and is budget friendly.",1369872000,,1445,4.699604743083004

3264869,5,B000YJOGDE,"Only a churl would complain about a Lone Ranger movie! This episode is a winner all around.  It even has a plot, with a defined beginning, middle and end:

It seems that Black Hat Lyle Bettger (""Kilgore"") wants to banish the peaceable local Indian tribe from their reservation. He has discovered a lode of silver in a sacred mountain. The real Black Hat is Robert J. Wilke, Bettger's foreman (""Cassidy""). This reviewer seems to remember Wilke for  hassling Montgomery Clift in ""From Here to Eternity"", getting himself stabbed by James Coburn in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and as one of the 5 bad guys in ""High Noon"".  That's quite a resume.

The film quality here is excellent, with fine sharp colors and nice western scenery. What's not to like indeed? Do the Ranger and Tonto let Bettger get away with his evil scheme? Of course not! The good guys win-and in a fine old-fashioned 1950s way. Previous reviewer Ojanen (from Finland, no less) urged us to ""Just Enjoy It""! Great advice!",1358035200,,981,4.747058823529412

This movie and The Lone Ranger TV show came out before I was born.  I watched the show in syndication as a child.  This movie has everything-great scenery, action, adventure, suspense, and best of all, a great story with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.  It's very exciting to watch, and really showcases the Lone Ranger.  I love that the Ranger and Tonto come to each other's aid when needed; that is most gratifying to me.  The one part I found hard to watch is near the beginning when Tonto goes into town and winds up being beat up by a bunch of Indian-hating townspeople, but of course the Ranger comes to rescue him.  All ends well, and the villain's wife is played by Bonita Granville Wrather, the wife of Jack Wrather, the owner of the Lone Ranger character.
 I also immensely enjoyed the interview with Dawn Moore, done by film critic Leonard Maltin, who is a lifelong Lone Ranger fan.  I'm envious of him that he got to meet BOTH Clayton Moore and his daughter.  There is another interview with actor Michael Ansara on this DVD; I only watched part of it, as I was more interested in the interview with Dawn Moore, which lasts about 37 minutes and was done Feb. 2001.",1347926400,,1324,4.407407407407407

3264908,5,B000YJOGDE,"It's a shame that this film is not more widely known and available, because it represents the pinnacle of the Lone Ranger, at least the on-screen version.  In addition to being the Lone Ranger's zenith, it also ranks among the Greatest Super-Hero Films of All Time, and is very good Western in its own right.

This is a good disk, relatively clear picture, functions well, and the inclusion of the original trailers for both this film and the sequel 'Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold,' is nice.  It would be nice to have a few more extras or special features, seeing as how much Lone Ranger material must really be out there, but I guess I shouldn't complain.

The TV series (which, BTW, I loved) was always hampered by shooting schedule and budget, so location filming, riding scenes, fight scenes, etc., were always kept to a minimum.  And usually the sets always looked as if they were constructed in 3 hours by the technicians at a local TV station in Cleveland, Ohio.

But in this film, besides being in color and having lots of outdoors scenes, there are plenty of great riding and fight scenes, including a full blown stampede.  Best of all, both the Masked Man and Tonto each get to do a full-blown, knock-down, drag out fist fight.  (Tonto's fight sequence is the more impressive one, since he ends up holding his own against an entire mob, until the sheer numbers inevitably overpower him.  I won't spoil it how that situation resolves...)  Additional treats include the Lone Ranger donning the Old Geezer disguise he often used in the TV series, and Silver doing some memorable work (similar to Lassie or Flipper, yet amazingly, this does not come off as corny).

Certainly there were no other actors, at least on screen, who ever did or ever could portray the Masked Man and Tonto as good as Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels.  Considering the material they had to work with, it would have been extremely easy for them to overdo it, or to be corny or campy.  But no, they each had an almost magical ability to make these potentially ludicrous characters believable and likable.

I am especially impressed by Silverheels, whose dialog for some inexplicable reason was always written as Johnny Weismueller-style broken English, always delivered his lines with credibility.  Tonto was never ridiculous, rather the opposite.  In this film, unfortunately, all the Native Americans have to speak in this idiotic way, and you can see how hard it is to be take these guys seriously.  Yet Silverheels' Tonto always projects intelligence and valor, despite horrible lines.  I attribute this to Silverheels' ability as an actor.

It's undeniable that the Lone Ranger's target audience was mostly kids, and that his appeal to adults draws its strength from the well of our childhood.  Yet it is a mistake to classify this film as being strictly for kids; there are in fact, many adult themes.  For instance, in one very effective sequence, a racially-motivated mob attempts to lynch Tonto.  I don't think there is anything on the Disney channel today, with our supposedly uncensored media, that deals with the American tradition of lynching (which was never formally outlawed until the 1960's).

The plot itself is concerned with a very adult theme, something that is perhaps more timely now even than in 1956.  The main action is concerned with the activities of a wealthy white man and his vicious second-in-command who engineer a series of `false flag' attacks and incidents so as to cause a group of darker-skinned persons to be blamed.  (No, this is not the story of the Bush Administration, except as allegory.)  The false flag attacks are intended to promote a war between whites, who have greater wealth and weaponry, and the Indians, so that the small group of whites can seize control of the natives' valuable mineral resources.

This film has a view of Pioneer/Indian conflicts that, besides being historically accurate, is surprising to find in 1956.  The Lone Ranger himself says outright that in all the fights between Whites and Indians, it's the Whites who have always started the trouble.  There are anti-war as well as anti-racism messages that seem ahead of their time.

The Masked Man and Tonto, as unequivocal representatives of Good, channel their energies into a desperate campaign to prevent a destructive war.  These two heroes have no super-powers or abilities, but appear to draw their strength from a respect for human life and a sense of fairness.  They remind us of what we knew to be right when we were children, and inspire us to believe in those things again.",1225670400,,4597,4.861360718870347

3264912,4,B000YJOGDE,"ALPHA VIDEO's THE LONE RANGER is a nice budget priced sampler of four episodes from the pioneering TV series' first year. Popular on radio and in movies, the Ranger enjoyed a five season run, airing 221 half-hour chapters on the ABC-TV network every Thursday at 7:30 pm from 9/15/49 to 6/6/57. (Seasons #1, #3 and #4 were a now unheard of 52 weeks each!) Clayton Moore starred, but so did John Hart, who portrayed the Ranger in season #3. Jay Silverheels played Tonto, and the stentorian announcer/narrator was Fred Foy.

Our story's a familiar one: A badly-wounded Texas Ranger, the only survivor of an ambush, is found by an Indian who nurses him back to health. The two men become friends and partners in a fight for law and order, with the masked Ranger at times dispensing instant justice in the form of a silver bullet.

SYNOPSES:
THE LEGION OF OLD TIMERS--  A rancher (played by Star Trek's Dr. McCoy, DeForest Kelley) is being forced to sell his inherited property. The Ranger, Tonto and the man's hired hands join forces to restore the ranch to its righful owner.

THE RENEGADES--  Tonto and his friend Chief Swift Eagle (Ralph Moody) are the targets of a corrupt Indian Agent and his Army deserter cohorts.

OLD JOE'S SISTER--  Two prison escapees flee to Joe Peter's cabin, where one convict kills both his jailmate and Joe. He then masquerades as Joe, fooling the man's sister who comes to visit her brother for the first time in 30 years.

CANNONBALL MCKAY--  An ex-con stage driver is framed for a Wells Fargo office robbery and rearrested. The actual holdup men plan to get rid of him by bombing the jail where he's being held.

3264913,5,B000YJOGDE,"When Clayton Moore assumed his signature role as The Lone Ranger in 1949, the character had been a fixture on the radio since 1933, played most notably by Earle Graser and then Brace Beemer.  (It is actually Beemer's voice, not Moore's, heard calling out ""Hi-Yo Silver"" at the beginning and end of the TV episodes.)  And Moore himself had starred in a number of other vehicles, most notably the Republic Pictures cliffhanger serials ""Perils of Nyoka,"" ""Jesse James Rides Again,"" ""G-Men Never Forget,"" and ""Ghost of Zorro.""  (The last role led directly, as I believe has mentioned elsewhere, to his casting as ""the OTHER Masked Rider of the Plains."")  So, while it is perfectly understandable and unobjectionable that some who are fans only of The Lone Ranger TELEVISION show might look askance at what must be admitted to be a drastically different portrayal, others might well be interested in looking at the earlier, certainly no less authentic incarnations of the character, and particularly this one from the world of cliffhanger serials in which Moore himself first achieved stardom.  The 1938 movie serial of ""The Lone Ranger"" is not only generally regarded as one of the finest examples of the serial form, it also marks an epoch in the developing mythos of the Lone Ranger himself, for it is here, for the first time anywhere, that the story of his mysterious origin was told, being slightly reworked for the radio program only several years later, and then adapted for the first three episodes of the TV show.  It is unfortunate that most of the serial exists only in quite poor condition, but as much has been done here as possible to make it viewable (for instance, by replacing the original serial footage where possible with equivalent sequences from the much shorter feature-length version, ""Hi-Yo Silver,"" which has survived in far better condition).  Anyone reading reviews of this product probably doesn't need to have Clayton Moore's TV episodes recommended to them, though I certainly will second any such recommendation.  I would only like to add that the Lone Ranger movie serial, despite the poor quality of the film master and the differences from the TV version, is likewise very much worth viewing, and that Mill Creek Entertainment has presented it here in the most watchable form that I, at least, have ever seen, and at a really remarkable bargain price, even if the TV episodes were not also included.  I think this is a must-have, and a must-see, for any real dyed-in-the-wool Lone Ranger fan.

ADDENDUM: I guess it's high time I add to the review itself what I'd already  added in a Comment: while the Mill Creek DVD release remains a bargain for what it is, if you want to see the original 1938 Lone Ranger movie serial in the most watchable form available in nearly 80 years, the edition you REALLY want is the one restored for the Serial Squadron by Eric Stedman.

3264928,5,B000YJOGDE,"Got out this set from its honored place in my DVD collection and re-viewed it yesterday while at home nursing a sprained ankle. What a great way to give yourself some ""R & R"" !!!!

  The Lone Ranger was always a superb television series, but the addition of color near the end of the series' run was a great idea on the part of producer Jack Wrather...and a shrewd

set-up for the upcoming feature film productions. And when Wrather went to color, he did it right. Some of the color work on the last seasons of ""The Adventures of Superman"" was uneven, but Wrather's ""Lone Ranger"" and ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon""

shows were photographed gorgeously. The colors in this Ranger collection are vivid and eye-catching.

The stories and acting hold up well, too. When LR creator Geo. Trendle first began shooting this series (as ""Apex Film Corp."")in 1949, he had Clayton Moore act somewhat wooden and stiff (Trendle's idea of ""stoic & heroic"") and directed him to use

perfect diction in the delivering of his lines. After Wrather took over in 1954 this loosened up a bit and allowed Moore a

bit more leeway in his interpretation of the masked Mr. John Reid. Moore took the opportunity to infuse more and more of himself into the Ranger (while still using good grammar) and the meld became so perfect that the two---the actor and the character---virtually became one (as was also the case with William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy and Duncan Renaldo as the Cisco Kid).

Jay Silverheels likewise had become the quintessential Tonto.

The three-episodes-a-week shooting schedules used in those days (for a half-hour show it could be done, but the pace was exhausting)

result in something one notices immediately in this collection---wherein episodes can be watched back to back; that being that the same actors can often be seen(sometimes in the same costumes) over and over again. In one show a young would-be

Sheriff is helped by the Ranger and Tonto to rid a mining town of bullying outlaws, and, the next thing you know, this same young fellow (now wearing a stick-on mustache) is a deputy town marshal , helping the Ranger help the blinded chief marshal get back his hope for living. And one of the baddies from the previous episode is in this one as well, wearing the same clothes. When you watched these on t.v. years ago...shown a week apart...and often out of shooting sequence...you didn't catch this sort of thing. Only now can you see how they worked this and it gives you a greater appreciation of how much inventiveness and ingenuity went into these rush-job productions.

Clayton Moore's principle stuntman, Bill Ward, shows his stuff to good effect in these episodes. Ward was great at ""ape-ing""

Clayton Moore's carraige and body language and this makes the

doubling much more effective and exciting. Ward...not that well known compared to other Hollywood stunt stars like Yakima Canutt,Dave Sharpe,Tom Steele, or Dale Van Sickle...was, nevertheless, wonderful at his trade. In his athleticism, agility, and coordination, Ward was strikingly similar to Dave Sharpe in his stuntwork. In fact, for a long time this reviewer believed that the fabulous ""bulldogging"" stunt at the end of the 1956 Warner Brothers theatrical movie ""The Lone Ranger"" was DONE by David Sharpe (an awesome leap from Silver, coming up from behind stuntman Bob Morgan...doubling ""baddie' Robert Wilke...followed by a tremendous rolling fistfight down a steep hillside). This ""gag"" had all the athletic earmarks of Sharpe, but in his book ""I Was That Masked Man"", Clayton Moore reveals that it was, in fact, Bill Ward wearing the mask in that amazing sequence. All Ranger fans owe it to themselves to see this great western and to marvel at the climactic fight, but Ward is on his game in this television collection as well, and does a bang-up job of providing exciting physical action on the Ranger's part.

One of the hallmarks of the entire Lone Ranger saga, on radio, in the movies, and on television, was its respect for the American Indians and their cultures. This respect is there in all the Clayton Moore productions, to be sure. This is quite true in an episode called ""Ghost Canyon"", where cowboy baddies try to crook a local tribe out of their heard of horses. They do this with assistance of the chief's ""nephew"", the only ""bad"" Indian around. Turns out, though, that the ""nephew"" is a fake,

a half-breed ex-con who doesn't really have an Indian heart or soul after all. He has killed the real nephew and taken his place.

This set is enclosed in a ""saddlebag"" package by Rhino Video that is pretty nifty and attractive. It is a good buy for the money, great nostalgia, and just good old fashioned storytelling

about the kind of hero/role-model for young people that we see

FAR too little of today.",1152576000,,4798,4.842298288508557

Written by Fran Striker.

Clayton Moore was a circus acrobat at the age of eight and grew up in the Midwest (Illinois)...worked in the circus and traveled to New York and then Hollywood where he became a stuntman and bit player...inducted into the ""Stuntman's Hall of Fame"" in 1982...also received the ""Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame'"" also the ""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum"" both in 1990...Clayton was once quoted ""Playing him [the Lone Ranger] made me a better person."", ""Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn't want any other. I was playing the good guy.""...""I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky."" (On his costume as the Lone Ranger, February 4, 1985)...Clayton very much enjoyed quoting and lived by ""A Ranger's Creed"" which included this moral lesson ""That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and light it himself.""

As such, including the first episode would probably seem out of place.  It is available in several other DVD releases, including the AMC first 14 episodes 2-disc set and in a dvd that combines the first 3 episodes into a movie of the origin of the Lone Ranger, each of which sell on Amazon for $9.99.

The final few seasons were intentionally (so far as I could surmise) filmed in color.  Again, if this is a selling point, purchase a set containing earlier episodes and you will be able to see the Lone Ranger in his B&W glory.

This period in the series contains some classic episodes, and the production quality of these later episodes is quite good compared to earlier years.  I think most fans of the masked man would not be disappointed with this set.",1117238400,,1007,4.592178770949721
3264941,5,B000YJOGDE,"Rhino Home Video was given the nod for another installment of the leading Western hero known as the Masked Man ""The Lone Ranger"", featuring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as Tonto...our Masked hero on his white horse (Silver) and his faithful Indian companion Tonto rode (Scout)into our lives and we've never been the same since...our children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome fun...when the good guys always won, good guys hat never fell off in a fist-fight and the moral to the story was fair-play.

Who ever thought back in 1931 a small Detroit radio station two men John Kunsky and George W. Trendle would be the start of our hero...later Trendle asked writer Fran Striker to develop a character that was sort of a Robin Hood and Zorro, thus The Lone Ranger was born and the very first broadcast January 31, 1933, America came to love and embrace this legendary lawman...then in 1949 Moore and Silverheels worked together in a film called ""The Cowboy and the Indians"", this was just the beginning of a long working friendship between to wonderful actors and human beings.

Every week in front of the tube the announcer would open with...""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger""...then the Masked Man would ride in and we would hear...""With his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early West! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! The Lone Ranger rides again""...we would sit glued to the TV and ride those dusty trails with our hero with plenty of action coming our way...so tighten up those cinches and get ready to ride.

All 19 episodes were beautifully remastered in color and restored...the Ranger films were always first class and the early years had some of the best of the best...they need to be out there for all of us who loved and looked up to Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels...both actors gave their characters life, their word was bond...never quit on a friend in need, always giving the other fellow an even break...this was the way of the early West...the code they lived by, they'll never be another Lone Ranger and Tonto!

This is truly fun stuff and even today holds up as a great western adventure...original airdate was from September 1956 thru January 1957...he was our hero & now once again because of film preservation this restored digital DVD Box Set we can escape to the old west...Great package and family entertainment...just the way it should be!

Anything that has AMC attached to it usually means a product less than what it can be. AMC, on cable tv, runs commercials in the middle of movies and, at times, squeezes in text at the bottom of the screen as the movie is airing, thus further corrupting the film experience.

3264943,4,B000YJOGDE,"I would have liked the set, which was a gift, better in B&W vs color. The reson for this is I originally watched it as a child in B & W the way the director meant for it to be seen in.

They should have included in the box set how the Lone Ranger(LR) became the LR namely the 1st episode. They might have assumed your not interested in this, or they couln't make it happen, for this set, contractually. Finally, they edited the opening theme scene, 2nd half, by deleting the naration the begins something like: ""Return to.... the days of old...."". They also edited out the visual of the LR & Silver riding down the 2nd half of the canyon trail which of course went with the naration.

Some months ago I had purchased a 2 DVD pack with 12 episodes of the first season of the Lone Ranger. {Platinum Disc Corp}

Well, almost. They're a few out of sequence, but I won't sweat the small stuff! I was very surprised at the print quality of most of the 12, and it has the first three episodes that intoduce the Ranger & Tonto. I got such a kick out of seeing these again, and so many memories flooded back in from those hours spent sitting in front of our 17"" black&white Admiral t.v. on Saturday mornings of 1950's in Southern California, whew, that I had to have MORE! Thus this purcahse! The colors great like the other fellow says, and clean good prints! What makes this different besides the color {and the last season of the show as well} of these episodes is the different locations that are used in just about every episode. Oh, yeah...Corriganville, Ivereson Ranch and the Susana Hills or 'Mts' if ya like are present in many, but you'll also go to Kanab, Utah. Columbia State Park in Central Ca. near Fresno. And outside of the Utah shots, my favorite; the Lone Pine Ca. location with the snow capped Sierras and the Alabama Hills as a back drop! WOW! I was a bit reluctant to plop down the $$  but I found a good deal at Fry's or Best Buy! Sorry Amazon old pal! But when I got home and started playing the dvd's I was really happy I made this purchase! ITS FUN! How many things do we buy any more that are FUN? Continuing onward; you'll have 19 episodes all in order of the airing dates of the last season. From Sept. 13th. 1956 thru Jan 17th. 1957. That leaves 20 episodes still remaining to be stamped into DVD's! {I hope}for the remainder of the 57' season, which ended 6-6-57. Yes, you read that right!! 39 episodes in a t.v. season! As was the common practice of t.v shows back in the day! Now, we are lucky to see our favorite program before a November air date, and end in March? But I ramble. If ya realy want to go a little further with a Lone Ranger Rush, read Clayton Moore's book; ""I Was That Masked Man"" other wise ""return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear.

3264946,5,B000YJOGDE,"VCI Entertainment and Warner Brothers have given us all a real gem here, in this greatest of all Lone Ranger movies, and, likely the capstone to Clayton Moore's career in the movies and television. Not only is this 1956 Warners production considered the best Lone Ranger story ever lensed---for the big screen OR the small---but it is considered by many film historians and aficionados around the world to be one of the best WESTERNS ever made...up there with some nifty John Wayne , John Ford, and Howard Hawks vehicles.

The color cinematography in TLR is glorious and the greens, rusts, blues, and every other color on the Warnercolor pallet

comes across vividly. This is just a scenically gorgeous movie to watch.

Stuart Heisler's direction here is sure-handed and solid and the screenplay is engrossing. And while TLR is not an ADULT adult western like, say, ""High Noon"", it is well above the level of the stereotypical ""kid's B-Picture"" as well. This is something with some meat and maturity to it, more along the lines of, say. Errol Flynn's ""Dodge City"" than a Saturday matinee Gene Autry oater. (Indeed, the narrative prolog for

TLR utilises stock footage of cattle drive and wagon train scenes FROM ""Dodge City"").

The cast is superb. Moore and Silverheels are definitive, as usual, and Michael Ansara gives a strong performance as an Indian warrior (and contributes to a great ""special features"" recollection as well, as does Bonita Granville). Lyle Bettger turns in one of his great patented oily villain portrayals as Reece Kilgore, greedy, power-hungry cattle baron trying to drive a tribe of Indians off their reservation so as to gain access to the large silver deposits he has discovered inside their venerated Spirit Mountain. Robert Wilke is equally evil as Cassidy , Kilgore's foreman and chief gunman. Wilke was one of the great villains of the 50s and 60s in movie and tv westerns, and, if you can't place him by name, he was Capt. Nemo's (James Mason's) burly first mate in Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".

The musical score to the film is excellent as well, with the talented David Buttolph doing first rate orchestrations of the William Tell Overture and numerous incidental background themes . One of these themes Buttolph uses in the film is quite interesting. In a scene where the Lone Ranger has secretly met with the territorial governor at a mission church, the two of them walk out from the mission talking and the the Lone Ranger mounts Silver and rides away with Tonto. Playing lightly in the background on the soundtrack is a jaunty little melody that, within a year's time or so, will evolve into the theme for t.v.'s ""Maverick"".

Some people who watch this film today seem amazed at how much respect for American Indians and their cultures are shown in it. This are obviously ""johnny-come-latelies"" to the Lone Ranger mythos, for anybody with ANY familiarity AT ALL with Lone Ranger media knows that Indians were ALWAYS treated with respect in all LR scripts , be they movie, radio, or television  scripts. In fact, it could well be argued that the Lone Ranger adventures were historically pivotal in showing the ""OTHER side of the coin"" re: Cowboy & Indian interaction in the old west.

Another great aspect of watching this movie is that you get to see ""The Stunt"", followed by ""The Fight"". Say what?, you ask.

Well, its like this; Clayton Moore's principle stunt double was a first-rate stuntman named Bill Ward . Ward was both a superlative rider (all scenes of TLR doing hair-raising rides or jumps on Silver are done by Ward, who was also Silver's ""wrangler"") and a great fight participant to boot. In this latter capacity, Bill Ward's agility, coordination, and overall athleticism was strikingly similar to that of the legendary David Sharpe (who, along with Yakima Canutt & Tom Steel, was considered the ""best in the business"" in the 30s, 40s, and into the fifties). When this reviewer first saw the end of this movie again some years ago, I believed absolutely that ""The Stunt"" had to have been done BY Dave Sharpe; thought he was the only one crazy enough, or agile enough, to have done it. But I was wrong. Ward did it. Clayton Moore says so in his autobiography.

So what IS this ""stunt"" I'm talking about? In Hollywood stunt parlance there was a ""gag"" called ""bulldogging"" that was done in B pictures so often it became almost a cliche. Derived from rodeo bulldogging, where a cowboy has to leap from his horse, grab a bull/steer around the neck and wrestle him to the ground, movie stunt ""bulldogging"" involved pursuit of the baddie by the stunt double of Roy, Gene, Hoppy, or whomever...at the end of which time Trigger, Champion, Topper (or whomever) would pull alongside the bad-guy's horse and

the good guy would dive across to the other guy's horse and pull that rider out of the saddle. Both would hit the ground and, after a brief exchange of blows, the good guy would punch the outlaw's lights out.

It was decided that the Robert Wilke character, ""Cassidy"", was going to try to ""make his break"" at the film's end, and that the Ranger would run him down on Silver and ""bulldog"" him. But the producer wanted something better than the standard old I've-seen-this-a-hundred-times bulldogging. He wanted something different and spectacular...and his stunt crew gave it to him. Bill Ward and Bob Morgan (who later lost a leg doubling George Peppard on the railroad logging car sequence in ""How The West Was Won"")came up with what is considered the greatest movie bulldogging stunt of all time. It has never been bested.

The stunt works this way: Ward is the Lone Ranger, in pursuit of Bob Morgan, who is doubling Robert Wilke. Morgan is skirting the edge of a steep ridge (the same ridge Ward and ""Tonto"" come charging down at the opening of the movie), Ward comes right into him from behind and from the side. He does NOT come directly alongside Morgan, but, instead, in an EXTREMELY dangerous move, LAUNCHES himself from the saddle from BEHIND Bob Morgan and literally FLIES through the air (no wire, no net, no CGI...no NOTHING) to grab Morgan and jerk him off his mount. THIS is ""the stunt"", and it remains awesome to this day.

""The fight"" follows ""the stunt"" immediately and the editing of the two is seamless. It is a rolling, slugging, tumbling fist fight that continues all the way to the bottom of this steep draw. The cross-cuts of Moore fighting Wilke and Ward fighting Morgan are excellent, and the totality of this entire sequence...from the bulldogging through the downhill fight...is just awesome. It is something no one who has ever seen this movie ever forgets.

I'd advise you to treat yourself to it as well. This is one humdinger of a western from start to finish, and if you are someone who loves colorful action and adventure in your cinema diet, then don't miss this one.

And yes, it ends just like you know it should:

  ""But, Padre, I wanted to see his face...to learn his name!""

  ""You cannot see his face. He will wear his mask until his

  work is done. And, as for his name...he is The Lone Ranger.""

  ""HI-YO SILVER!!! AWAY!!""

I don't recall ever seeing any of these in syndication. I was also surprised at how good they were- actually better than many of the later episodes.

 These three shows explain everything that I was curious about as a kid: the origin of the Lone Ranger, Where Tonto came from, how he found Silver, the meaning of the silver bullets, the vow to never shoot to kill.... It is all there, everything I wondered about as a boy.

 I supposed some people will consider the dialog and the acting to be old fashion.
