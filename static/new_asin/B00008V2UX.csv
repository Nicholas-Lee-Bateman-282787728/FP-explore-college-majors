7986920,5,B00008V2UX,"Saint Tail is an amazing anime/manga series that should not be missed!!! If you enjoy magical girl type anime (in the same vein as sailor moon, ect). Then you will love this show! If you haven't seen it before I would get this set last & start at the beginning as it's the final 3 volumes of the series (21 episodes total so almost a whole season if you go by the 26 episode per season/series anime episode average lol) This should have been played on Cartoon Network or any channel really because it would've gotten the wider audience in the U.S. that it deserves! This series is very underrated here & most people have never heard of it BUT in Japan it was actually pretty popular when it was airing on tv & still is to some :) Volumes 1-4 are in English/Japanese audio with English subtitles of course but this set was only released in Japanese audio with English subtitles for some reason (I think Tokyopop had a deadline to dub the series & they were cutting it pretty close so they ditched the dub altogether & just ended up subbing the remaining 20 something episodes, is what I heard) Regardless of the language though this is a series not to be missed! A FULL series box set is long overdue for this also (I know it currently isn't licensed in the U.S. but you never know when the series will get picked up again & I really hope it does!) I can just imagine how crisp & beautiful the picture quality would be on Blu-Ray! I know Japan released a Blu-Ray boxset of the entire series (no English subtitles though & its R2 coded so you would need a region free Blu-Ray player to watch it) also the Japanese boxset is pretty expensive in case you were wondering! Anyways sorry for the long review I just had to review one of my favorite anime's growing up! P.s, VIZ or FUNIMATION PLEASEEE re-release this series! The English dub was actually pretty good as well as the Japanese so I'm happy with whatever language it comes in hehe :p A fully proper re-dub like sailor moon would be very nice *Wink Wink* ;-)",1453593600,,2011,4.379679144385027
7986921,5,B00008V2UX,"Sega's take on the magical girl anime genre is undoubtedly the best. You've probably seen Card Captor Sakura and Sailor Moon, but Saint Tail AKA Meimi Haneoka puts all those other magical girls to shame. Her personality is much stronger than Serena's/Sailor Moon's, and her escapades with Asuka Jr. are full of both humor and intrigue. Sega does a masterful job of holding our interest in the series by setting two characters up for a romance and then frustrating that chance for happiness with everything that could possibly come between them. This series is a must-have if you are a true Sega fan!

This 3-disc DVD collection is the sixth of six and contains the final 21 episodes of the Saint Tail series. It is by far the largest collection of Saint Tail episodes published by Tokyopop. Several characters become more developed in these latter episodes, including: Takamiya, Sawatari, Asuka Sr., the mayor, and Meimi's two friends from school. The final four episodes set the stage for a truly amazing finale - a showdown between Saint Tail and Rosemary, the ultimate villainess of the series. Rosemary is an unforgettable character with very human motives and emotions. This collection contains the following episodes:

7986922,3,B00008V2UX,"I love Saint Tail but I feel the Anime is lacking in many ways. Sure this volume is lacking an english track but it also lacks the charm of the manga. The music ages this series by thirty years. I heard this show was made in the mid 1990s but I thought I heard seventies music and the lack luster animation verifies this impression what is up with cheesy seventies music in Anime.

The anime has its good points such as additional stories that you won't find in the manga. The character designs are much cleaner than the manga version. Additional screen time for the parents of the heroine.

I can conclude with a final note that this is a nice treat for those who haven't read the manga enjoy.",1140393600,,694,4.3307692307692305
7986923,4,B00008V2UX,"The story of Saint Tail comes to an end in this boxset. For me, the ending was quite unexpected and exceeded my expectations. The little twists they threw in the story keep things interesting as the story reaches it's climax. If you've loved Saint Tail so far, you're going to love the ending. A fitting end to a sweet tale at a great price for the high number of episodes in this DVD set.

Only negative part of this boxset was the incredible amount of filler episodes. I found myself skipping through some of the episodes because they didn't have anything important to contribute to the main storyline. Could have been a better show if it had less filler episodes but all in all a cute enjoyable show.",1108080000,4,703,4.4921875
7986924,4,B00008V2UX,"If you like Sailor Moon, Pretear, CCS, Kaleido Star,Wedding Peach,Tokyo Mew Mew, etc. give this a try. I don't think it reached as many people as it could have given that it was never finished in English dubbing. But just because it didn't get as much exposure doesn't make it any less as good as say Wedding Peach, Tokyo MM, or CCS.",1087776000,,333,4.387096774193548
7986925,4,B00008V2UX,This is so good..... But its only in japanese not dubbed in english. Theres eps 23-43 in the boxset. Contains the final 21episodes in the series..,1071532800,2,146,4.653846153846154
7986926,4,B00008V2UX,"This collection is really good. As Meimi struggles whether or not to tell Asuka Jr. if she's St. Tail. By day, Asuka Jr. keep think if his classmate Meimi Haneoka is really St. Tail. I won't spoil the what happen, but in the end, all ends well. Theres 3 disc for this collection and theres lots of extras for each disc. I recommend you buying this because its a really great series that you won't forget. It's a really sweet story about a wanna-be detective chasing a theif, but somewhere in the story, something unexpected happens.",1058054400,5,532,4.552083333333333
7986927,4,B00008V2UX,"A great ending to a great series. Nothing childish or silly about it. Wish they had finished it in English, but still highly enjoyable. If you liked KKJeanne, get this!",1054339200,6,168,4.633333333333334
