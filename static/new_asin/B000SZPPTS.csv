8207113,4,B000SZPPTS,"I've always liked Welles' adaption of the Trial although feedback seems to be mixed. Even though little things are changed the overall story is there and the changes are at least true to the MOOD of the book in my opinion. As another reviewer stated this is public domain and can be watched online no problem.

Sobibor is based on a true story and as the title suggests is about an escape from a concentration camp. I also enjoyed this one very much.

I would rate both movies somewhere in between 7 and 8 out of 10. HOWEVER...and this is big... Having two full length movies on one DVD....well you can imagine what the video quality looks like. It's blurry and pixelated. No special features to speak of. No subtitle options. The sound is also subpar although it's there and serviceable. Serviceable is such a good word to describe this set. It's enough to work and is intended for the casual viewer. I paid 5 dollars after shipping. I felt that was fair. Let's be honest here. More often than not you get what you pay for. This is a 2 star transfer. A 4 star rating ONLY because the price is right.",1394064000,,1100,4.413793103448276

8207115,4,B000SZPPTS,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films that have no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on their back covers. Audio levels are superb, some of the highest distortion-free sound you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

Their dub of made-for-TVer ESCAPE FROM SOBIBOR is particularly fine: sharp full screen image, vibrant color and clear audio. Its only limitation is strobe effect during the escape. Although THE TRIAL has a crisp, letterboxed picture, the sound is slightly out-of-sync and shows warble on the opening credit theme, Albinoni's Adagio.

""Sobibor"" is nothing less than remarkable: a gripping true story of a WWII mass escape from the concentration camp located in occupied Poland. To avoid land mines buried all around this site, 600 prisoners charged the front gate en masse and broke through. Machine gun fire killed half their number; the rest made it to freedom. This tragedy-turned-triumphant is a story never to be forgotten. Highest recommendation!

""Trial"" is not for everyone. Director Orson Welles at times employs minimalism but as often he captures vast crowds, both indoors and out. Most confusing to those not familiar with Kafka's book are its metaphors and symbolism. Example: On his way to a court building, the accused Josef K. (Perkins) walks through a plaza crowded with elderly people who are in various states of undress and wear numbered placards around their necks. Looming above them is a statue with arms extended that's hidden by a white sheet. Some barely perceptible movement might be a cinematic error or could mean that beneath its spotless shroud is a human being. (I still haven't figured that one out!)

Josef K. is charged by police for an unspecified crime. His efforts against a baffling legal system go nowhere and ultimately get him escorted to an open field. Josef has no idea what's in store.

8207117,5,B000SZPPTS,"The Trial was a novel that Orson Welles transformed into a movie that brought plenty of drama to the screen.

Escape from Sobibor was a documentary film a about one of the NAZI death camps in Poland where 600 hundred prisoners escaped. Only about 300 made it to freedom,half were killed as they fled for freedom. Those that did escape are living today in various parts of the world.",1162425600,2,382,4.536231884057971
