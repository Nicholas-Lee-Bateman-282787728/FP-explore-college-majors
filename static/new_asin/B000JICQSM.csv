8150413,1,B000JICQSM,This is worthless.  There is very little details.  PADI  should be ashamed of this product,1469318400,,90,4.866666666666666
8150414,3,B000JICQSM,"About one hour long introduction to all the different adventure dives there are. Good for a one time watch, but borderline advertisement for the different programs, not really that educational, won't replace the book or studying for the courses. Overall OK, but not great.",1453593600,,272,5.204545454545454
8150415,5,B000JICQSM,Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint.,1439078400,,48,5.125
8150416,5,B000JICQSM,Great start to go with the dive course at your local shop,1431302400,,57,3.8333333333333335
8150417,5,B000JICQSM,"Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Can't wait for PADI to update their videos, especially the section on underwater videography, but this video gives simple ideas.",1425772800,,173,5.653846153846154
8150418,1,B000JICQSM,"This review is about the product, not the seller.  The seller was outstanding.

This video is worthless.  Yep, worth nothing.  I threw it away because there is no point in having this video.  This video is one big sales campaigin from PADI - it goes through all of the advanced open water dives in about 45 seconds each, then gives about 1:30 each to Night, Deep, and Navigation.

An absolute waste if you are going for your O.W. Advanced cert, because there is no information in the DVD other than, ""Yep, if you want to dive at altitude, take the altitude dive; if you want to use your compass, take the navigation dive.""  Seriously, that's it.  There is no knowledge to be gained from this DVD.

Also an absolute waste if you're interested in scuba, or in the O.W. Advance program, because the free information on PADI's website is about 10 times more informative than this.

PADI requires scuba shops to verify that you've watched this video if you are going to do your O.W. Advanced certification with them.  Don't do it.  Just tell the shop that you've purchased your book, slate, and DVD from the internet.  Save your money.  My instructor asked me if I had watched the video.  I said, ""yep, and it was a waste of time.  I watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss something or accidentally skip chapters.  I learned nothing.""  She said, ""Eh, okay.  Yeah, a lot of people say that it's not very useful, and it kind of isn't.  But we have to ask if you've watched it in order for you to do the Advanced dives.""

Things like this have me seriously considering switching to SSI from PADI.

Again, this review is about the product, not the seller.  The seller was outstanding.",1414108800,4,1685,4.488448844884489
8150419,3,B000JICQSM,Just regular PADI information.,1413504000,,30,6.75
8150420,5,B000JICQSM,Good teaching and review video,1412121600,,30,5.2
8150421,5,B000JICQSM,After reading the AOW book I watched the DVD. I like having the visual also.  The only complaint I have is that the characters have that 80's look.  Maybe PADI can use the newest GoPro  to revamp this DVD !,1381104000,,206,4.1
