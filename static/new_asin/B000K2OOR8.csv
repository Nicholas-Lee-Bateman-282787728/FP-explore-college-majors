8154102,5,B000K2OOR8,"Don't be deceived by the cover. It's a very beautiful robot animation work(1978) based on ""Romeo and Juliet"" and possibly ""Hamlet."" A superb love story between the gorgeous-looking Earthling pilot and the beautiful-hearted alien princess with rich themes of friendship, loyalty, family love, trust, and sacrifice. True love trusts to the end. One of the best in its kind. Too bad the importer did not import the original Daimos music!",1417910400,,434,5.214285714285714
8154103,5,B000K2OOR8,"This was also called Diamos it was part of the Shogun Warriors era that came out in 1983 before the well known Transformers. Love this animated movie and if you love the Transformer animated movie you will love this. Harold Harden Chattanooga,TN.",1381968000,,246,4.880952380952381
8154104,2,B000K2OOR8,"If you have access to or know someone with the complete Daimos series, I suggest you go that route.  This DVD cuts out way too much from the series to actually enjoy it.  Of course if you have never watched the Daimos series, then this will do.  But even then you will still ask the questions of why did it/this happen, when did it/this happen, etc.  Not to mention the price of this just went up seven fold, not worth the current asking price.",1310688000,6,444,4.25
