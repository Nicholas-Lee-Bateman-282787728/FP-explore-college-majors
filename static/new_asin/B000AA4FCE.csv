2382825,5,B000AA4FCE,despite what is seen in this video it is hard to imagine what the prisoners endured. what a sick mind to try and nearly succeed in eliminating a group of people,1314144000,,160,4.193548387096774
2382826,5,B000AA4FCE,"This documentary of the horrifying findings at the Auschwitz death camp should stand out as stark reminder of the costs of ""racial purity"" and hopefully never be repeated, but as we have already seen this is not the case ( Baltic Republics, Darfur Etc.) Every one who has an interest in stopping genocide should see this as well as the other videos in this series. It should be taught in the schools and shown to world leaders. This has many never before seen images and is definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Outstanding documentation filmed by Russian film crews as the camp was liberated with a few scenes ""staged"" by the prisoners of the camp in the days following liberation. A testament to the horrors of the NAZI 3rd reich. May they not be forgotten and their deeds not go unpunished.",1252022400,23,794,4.598591549295775
2382827,4,B000AA4FCE,"This film basically consists of black and white film footage captured by Capt Alexander Vrotsos who was part of the Soviet film crew attached to the First Ukrainian Front in 1945. When the Soviets liberated Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi death camp, they witnessed the horrors of the camp - emaciated survivors who resembled walking corpses, mounds of human bodies, the crematoria [which the Germans had tried to destroy, but still yielded plenty of evidence pointing to their atrocities], the belongings of Nazi victims who had been gassed/shot/incarcerated and many other horrors.

There's no music accompanying this film, just a monotonous background narration in a matter-of-fact manner - perhaps this was apt considering nothing could offset the horrors presented on the screen. The horrific images of the horror that was Auschwitz has been seen many times before, in other films/documentaries etc, and I think that ""Holocaust: The Liberation of Auschwitz"" portrays this well. However, it could have done with some extra features, such as the background history of the camp, as well as some history as to what happened to some of the infamous SS personnel associated with the camp [hence my 4 out of 5 star rating].",1232409600,39,1218,5.182741116751269

2382837,1,B000AA4FCE,"This film offers a clumsy rendition of the usual Auschwitz propaganda (extermination through work, walking skeletons, etc.), along with a few more creative contributions (e.g. a prisoner being deliberately infected with leprosy). Curiously, the video often contradicts the narration.  Most of the prisoners shown appear to be in quite good health, and a startling number of them are rather fat.  It is clear that those who are emaciated are so because of disease, not maltreatment or deliberate starvation.  There is plenty of footage of perfectly healthy prisoners, and if one sets aside the narration and the clumsily inserted propaganda shots, the overall impression is of a wartime internment and labor camp - which, of course, is what Auschwitz actually was.

Sometimes the propaganda is so poorly done as to create a very amusing effect, for instance when the remains of fires not much bigger than campfires are shown, with an unburned severed head or two incongruously placed in them, and the narration asserts that these were used by the Germans to burn the bodies of the prisoners.  Such puny fires would never have sufficed for the massive incineration job that the Germans allegedly faced (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Auschwitz-Open-Air-Incinerations-Holocaust-Handbook/dp/0981808530/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Auschwitz: Open Air Incinerations (Holocaust Handbook)</a>), and had they used them they wouldn't have left unburned heads lying around.  The heads have obviously been placed there by the Soviets.  Similar remarks apply to much of the rest of the film.

The film also erroneously asserts that ""the Soviet press agency did not inform the world of the extent of the crimes of Auschwitz until May 7, 1945."" Actually, the first story published about Auschwitz after the Soviets captured the camp appeared in Pravda on February 3, 1945, and quickly found its way into the western press.  It involved a giant electrified conveyor belt which both killed its victims and took their bodies to be burned in a blast furnace.  This story was quickly dropped, and everyone now admits that it was a lie.

In short, this documentary does have some interesting footage, but you'll have to look past a lot of propaganda to extract the bits that are of value.",1360454400,2,2314,5.453781512605042

8076633,5,B000AA4FCE,"Holocaust: the Liberation of Auschwitz, 2005 film

This documentary contains film take from January 27 to February 28, 1945 just after the concentration camp was liberated. It was not edited and preserved the original material. Simon Wiesenthal introduces the story of the six million murdered. Auschwitz was the largest complex (built on the Polish Army Cavalry military camp). One cameraman is left from those who filmed the liberation. Only 18 minutes were previously shown. When the Soviet Army forces arrived they recorded the events. The narrator tells how prisoners were starved and worked to exhaustion, then murdered. New prisoners replaced them. Forced laborers lived in better conditions than camp prisoners. The Nazis destroyed the crematoriums at the end of 1944, also most documents about those buildings. Hygienic conditions were deplorable. The cameras used could not record sound. The prisoners suffered from conditions that would affect the survivors for a lifetime.

They show piles of suitcases from the prisoners. The contents were sorted and sent to Germany for re-use after being cleansed. Gold teeth were melted into gold bars. Even hairbrushes were recycled. Bales of human hair were converted for industrial use or felt slippers. The SS ran these camps. New arrivals were sorted as to ability to work; the unable were soon exterminated in the gas chambers. Then hunger and exhaustion killed the rest. The buildings at Birkenau were preserved as a memorial. The testimony of prisoners was taken for use at the Nuremberg Trials. Hanging was the punishment for resistance or trying to escape. Or being starved to death! Young children aged 8 were used to transport coal or corpses. Other children were injected for experimental purposes; most died. There were other punishments. Some did not survive the ordeal. There was a solemn funeral ceremony in February 1945 for former prisoners. Orphaned children were sent to convents or adopted by Polish families. There were lasting psychological effects with survivors.

There are previews of the other documentaries: Theresienstadt; Dachau and Sachsenhausen; Majdanek; and Ravensbruck. This documentary is important after you read a history of Nazi Germany. By itself it is only a small part of the whole story. The theories of Darwin justified the actions of a master race against those who they classified as sub-human. Do you recognize this attitude in some people today? Dr. Miklos Nyiszli wrote Auschwitz about his experiences at this extermination camp; it supplements this documentary.",1489363200,,2561,5.381546134663342

8076637,5,B000AA4FCE,"For a documentary film developed from Russian camera equipment during the 1940s, the results are incredible - and superb.  It is correct this documentation was used as prosecution evidence at the Nuremburg War Crime Trials.  I have several documentary DVDS about International War
Crimes (IWC) Trials held in Nuremberg, and portions of the documentation films in this DVD have appeared in those.  The introduction by Simon Wiesenthal is very informative as well as the statements by Captain Alexander Vorontsov the only surviving cameraman from the Soviet film crew attached to the 1st Ukrainian front, and, in Jan/Feb 1945, filmed the liberation of the death camp Auschwitz.  The descriptions by Captain Vorontsov about himself and his comrades  who saw the horrid scenes encountered by the liberators facilitated better comprehension re. the contents of the film in this DVD.  The Captain documented how the majority of prisoners were forced to leave Auschwitz by the German SS as the Russian Army approached which resulted in the infamous Death Marches.  The Captain recorded the horrid truths about children used in medical experiments, torture and death - including the remains of those who died.  The Russians presented an tragic but accurate record for the plight of the remaining 6,000 prisoners and the closing of Auschwitz, on February 28, 1945.  I will never forget the film's contents that showed destroyed buildings to cover up the genocide, but piles of human ashes - as high as 6 feet - left on the grounds as well as the whole complex as revealed in photos of the grounds from allied aircraft.  This DVD is a sine qua nonne to have a full grasp of what  happened there.",1434067200,4,1685,5.025179856115108

It is not as long as some and does not show as much as others I have seen, but what is there will break your heart. The babies and children is the worst and that is what you will see the most off when it comes to death. As you watch these type movies one cannot help but wonder how could such things have happen. How could one man's hate bring about so much death and suffering? It had to be pure evil. I often ask myself how the German people could have gone along with such suffering by others. Of course I don't believe all Germans knew how evil their leader was. By 1940 had they known I doubt there is anything that could have changed this part of our history.",1418428800,6,761,4.046357615894039
