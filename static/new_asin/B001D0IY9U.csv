If you are one who wants to believe you are not a victim, and that there must be something you can do to take control of your life and its circumstances, this DVD will pull you forward.  It provides direction to the simple yet profound steps necessary to change.  Joe explains the science and research involved on the all important topic of spontaneous remissions.  If you or someone you know has lost hope in the treatment of cancer or other illness, this DVD invites them to embark on taking control of their on recovery, rather than leaving it up to chance or putting there future in someone elses hands.  If you believe in this DVD and have a health issue, you may also want to check out ""The Silva Method"".  If you believe and you want to create wealth, read Napolean Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich"".  If you want to create abundance of all types, check out ""The Teachings of Abraham"" by the Esters.

Dr. Dispenza is one of my personal heroes.  As an engineer, I have a need for concepts to be logical, which can limit my beliefs.  However, Joe has taught me to be a believer in spontaneous remissions ( or miracles ) by explaining the science behind them.",1217030400,48,1291,4.45531914893617

3521188,3,B001D0IY9U,"I, like many others, I've no doubt, saw Dr Dispenza on 'What The Bleep' dvd.  His contribution in that production resonated and inspired me in such a way that I couldn't wait to get this particular presentation.  However, this production is in a 'lecture hall format' and although what he has to say is pertinent to his philosophy, there is understandably some repetition of what you've heard before, and a question/answer section that takes up some of the time.  Unfortunately, the answers he gave were probably okay for the person asking the question, but I couldn't help feeling that his answers 'droned on' and I came away feeling ""Well, nothing more gained here"".  It was a lot of money and quite frankly, he made a more concise and well presented explanation of his ideas in 'What The Bleep'.  Get that dvd.  It's cheaper and has more information from other scientists supporting Dr Dispenza's ideas as well as a better interview with him.",1263859200,33,945,4.802469135802469

8290722,5,B001D0IY9U,"Joe Dispenza is always outstanding.  Even when you have heard it before, there is often a message
that was missed or we hear it again in a new way.  Have watched this a dozen times and loaned it to
friends who have raved about it also.
It is amazing to see how physically perfect he is after his terrible accident.  It makes everything he
says so much more believable.",1415491200,2,368,4.304347826086956
