1386852,4,B000051S45,Of course since we had the same title in the past we knew what we would be getting and we were not disappointed.  We much prefer the older versions of Dr. Seuss rather than the new videos made from TV with puppets.,1259712000,2,214,4.095238095238095
1386853,5,B000051S45,I watched this movie so much as a kid.  It was one of my favorites.  The stories are great (my favorite being The Sneeches) but the transitions are the best.  The songs that the Cat in the Hat sings will be stuck it your head for days.  Enjoy.,1187222400,,243,4.0
1386854,5,B000051S45,"...especially the songs within the stories. But Allan Sherman as the Cat in The Hat is delightful, Paul Winchell's voice characterizations are wondrous, and the reliable DePatie-Freleng animators make it a visual treat.
My 3-year old runs around the house happily singing all the tunes that the Cat in The Hat uses to introduce the tales, and he's absolutely enthralled with the Sneetches & Green Eggs & Ham (tends to skip through the Zax, however).
If you have a child (or children) that like Dr. Seuss stories, I *highly* recommend it.",995328000,5,537,4.912087912087912
1386855,4,B000051S45,"Dr Seuss - On the Loose is a short video with three of Dr Seuss's stories: The Sneetches, The Zax and Green Eggs and Ham.  The cat in the hat is the narrarator who links the three stories together.  The stories are told with the orginal words, a few simple songs and animation that is very faithful to the original drawings.  I think (but am not positive) that Dr. Seuss was very involved with this project and wrote the cat in the hat's words.  My kids have loved this video for many years.  I would never choose to watch it on my own but I can still enjoy snuggling with the kids and watching it with them, which is impressive after all the times the kids and I have seen it.  I think it is true to Dr. Seuss which is high praise.",975974400,12,732,4.083916083916084

7929324,4,B000051S45,Bought this because I had this collection as a kid. It's always fun to go back and watch kids programming because invariably there are adult jokes in it.,1390953600,,153,4.5
7929325,5,B000051S45,I purchased this for my grown son for Christmas.  I taped it when it was on TV when he was 4 and over the next several years he darn near wore the VHS tape out.  It was a great memory for him and me too.,1388707200,,203,3.488888888888889
7929326,5,B000051S45,"I ordered this to help me with my college work before I changed my major to something other than EARLY CHILDHOOLD DEVELOPMENT.  The government is too involved in this.  You have to go to college to get the degree, then every year take a stupid test to qualify.  NOT worth my time or effort, especially, when I do not get paid enough to put up with all the new laws they keep making for daycares.",1382832000,,395,4.24
7929327,5,B000051S45,"Cute video. I needed it for work. Although it is old and outdated, students liked watching the stories they read.",1377561600,,113,4.7
7929328,5,B000051S45,My children watched this when they were small.  My daughter was thrilled to get this copy so that she can save it for her children to watch and enjoy,1358726400,,149,4.137931034482759
7929329,2,B000051S45,"These are the original stories I grew up with, which is great. What's not so great is that the quality of the video has not been updated at all. So for almost $30 you get a DVD with grainy and washed out images. In Green Eggs and Ham the drawings of characters have weird auras around them. It's hard to describe but looks really bad. On top of that the DVD itself is a little too old-school. There's no option menu so you just have to fast forward or rewind to the story you want. You cannot select a specific story or chapter - very annoying! All this wouldn't be such a big deal if the DVD weren't so outrageously priced. Total rip-off. Also, if you're looking for the sing-along classic, this isn't it. It has the songs but the lyrics are not scrolling on the screen.",1330473600,7,771,4.2517006802721085
7929330,5,B000051S45,We have been looking EVERYWHERE for this DVD and finally found it on Amazon!!  This was a favorite when our daughter was growing up and we know the whole thing by heart!  Have looked and looked in stores and finally succeeded! Thanks Amazon!!,1294963200,4,242,4.604651162790698
7929331,4,B000051S45,"This Dr. Seuss collection includes the best Seuss animation anywhere - the Sneetches, the Zax and Green Eggs and Ham.  Unlike the versions where the camera simply points at the book, this collection's animations come alive with songs and plenty of motion - but not to the point of insanity like the newer versions of The Cat in the Hat, etc.

The lessons in these three videos - especially the star-bellied Sneetches and the north-/south-going Zax - are some of the most important lessons we can teach our kids.  My sons are 5 and 9 and the older one, especially, is learning from them - while my younger one is simply enjoying the music.  Classic entertainment - can't be more highly recommended.

However - why would anyone pay $30 for 25 minutes of video?  Yes, it's worthwhile - but you can get a VHS copy for next-to-nothing or get it out of your library for free.  I would have purchased this for $10 - maybe even $15 - but not at the ridiculous asking price of $29.99.  I get the feeling whoever decided on a sale price for this was related to the salesman in the Sneetches!",1261440000,20,1081,4.451776649746193
