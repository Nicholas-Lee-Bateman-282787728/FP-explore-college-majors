2217528,4,B0007LBLWS,"An entertaining indie film, also released as THE NIGHT WE CALLED IT A DAY. The story seems romanticized in its view of Frank Sinatra's major dust up with the Aussie press. But it actually happened. Dennis Hopper's performance does sell the story while, at the same time, can be a bit distracting--simply because Hopper bears so little physical resemblance to the legendary crooner. What also makes the film worthwhile is a solid line-up of Australian players now familiar to American audiences, including Rose Byrne who was so dynamic in FX's DAMAGES and Portia DiRossi, better known for her great comic turn in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. Hearing them emote in their native accents, reminds us how easily Aussie thespians can handle our American inflections. Another fine player is Joel Edgerton as the young promoter who bets all his dreams on getting Ol Blue Eyes to perform down under.",1281312000,2,883,5.054794520547945
2217529,5,B0007LBLWS,This  is  a  really  great  semi-documentary! Sinatra played perfectly by  Dennis Hopper. I  don't know  why  it  hadn't recieved  more  acclaim  but  see or...  better  buy  it.  Austrailia didn't  appreciate  Sinatra's  Brash  attitude. Hopper at his BEST!

2217531,5,B0007LBLWS,"Very underrated and very entertaining Aussie film with Dennis Hopper as Sinatra.

2217532,1,B0007LBLWS,"In July of 1974 Sinatra made wordwide headlines during his first concert appearance in Australia since 1959.

Reacting to being ""manhandled"" by members of the Australian press corps, Sinatra, as was his habit, used the concert stage to lash back, calling members of the Austrlian press ""pimps and whores""....

..."" wouldn't drink water with them,"" Frank said,""much less talk to them.....we, who have God given talent say to hell with them!""

The Australian labor unions, unimpressed by the Sinatra legend, responded quickly (""who the hell does this man Sinatra think he is?!""--refusing to fuel Frank's private jet; virtually keeping him prisoner in the country and cutting off all room service to his hotel suite.

Eventually, after a series of summit meeting between Sinatra's attorney, Mickey Rudin, and Robert Hawke, Union President, things were worked out and Sinatra finished his concert tour and fled Australia amidst a sea of tabloid headlines (SINATRA DECLARES WAR ON AUSTRALIA).

This event has been dramatized in a new Austrlian made film ""All The Way"" (originally entitled ""The Night We Called It A Day"" when first released in 2003).

Sinatra's ""war"" with Australia could have made an interesting film, but the writers and director of ""All The Way""  (Michael Thomas, Peter Clifton and Paul Goldman) literally fitter away every available opporunity.

The film's plot centers around a down on his luck rock promoter, who scores his one big chance at success by bringing Sinatra to Australia.....his girlfriend (Portia Di Rossi), a TV reporter ruins his big break by asking Sinatra a series of highly personal questions during Frank's arrival at Sydney airport--she is spat upon and an assortment of other newspeople are roughed up by various members of Sinatra's ""secret service.""

Instead of sticking to the facts (far more compelling than the ones invented for the film,) a phoney relationship is depicted between Sinatra, Barbara Marx (Melanie Griffith) and the rock promoter (Joel Edgerton).

Ms Marx, in what has to be the dumbest piece of character writing in film history) plays matchmaker to the promoter and his female assistant (Rose Byrne) while Frank sits in his suite and eats cold food out of a can.......and while we're at it, couldn't the Australian casting crew found an actor who in some way actually resembled the real Jilly Rizzo (certainly a colorful enough character in his own right)?

How's Dennis Hopper as FS?

Playing a larger than life icon is never easy, but Hopper pulls it off...he's Frank Booth with a tuxedo and a hand mike, even down to the famous FS onstage gestures as his lip syncs ""I've Got You Under My Skin""...

Rapid Sinatra followers will possibly find ""All The Way"" an amusing little curiosty.....

The rest of us can only be grateful that Frank's not around to see it.

2217561,4,B0007LBLWS,"Robert Schenkkans award winning play is lifted to the screen by director Jay Roach.  The film brought Schenkkan and his screenplay along with Tony winning Bryan Cranston as President Lyndon B. Johnson.  The film covers just under one year in Johnsons presidency beginning hours after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.  It concludes with his election in November 1964.  Virtually no time is spent with the personal aftermath of the murder.  One brief shot shows Jackie Kennedy sitting in a small room still wearing her blood stained pink suit.  It will be interesting to see the new movie, Jackie, for that perspective on the aftermath.

Clearly LBJ is moving on and one of his first orders of business is to press ahead with Kennedys fledgling Civil Rights Act.  This sets the stage for LBJs wrangling of his fellow Southern Democrats and Republicans along with the Civil Rights stalwarts led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Anthony Mackie).  Cranstons performance as Johnson is worth the price of admission alone.  He has nailed not only the look (excellent make-up work), the walk, the stance, the mannerisms and the cadence of his Texas drawl.

Johnson vowed to get the legislation passed but for it to have any chance he had to gut the voting rights provision.  This was unacceptable to King and his associates but eventually they agreed when LBJ promised to put it back in play after his election.  On the other side, the Southern Dems led by a long time LBJ mentor, Sen. Richard Russell (Frank Langella) vowed to kill the legislation by filibuster which required a 2/3rd majority to override in those days.  It takes only 60 votes now.  It is great fun to watch Johnson button-hole various senators, representatives and governors throughout this movie.  He worked them every which way.  Promises, bribes, threats?  Whatever worked.  As if this battle wasn't enough to contend with, he also had an upcoming election and he anticipated the GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater was a legitimate threat.  We know of course, Johnson won the 64 election in a landslide.

This was also the beginning of the end of his otherwise successful presidency.  The conflict in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, was an increasingly serious annoyance.  Melissa Leo is perfect as Lady Bird, a constant influence on her husband in this biopic.  A relatively obscure subplot involves Johnsons chief political aide, Walter Jenkins (Todd Weeks).  Jenkins, a married man with 6 children was also a closeted homosexual.  When hes arrested for having public sex with a man, the potential scandal could have impacted the election.  In a great scene at the end of the movie, LBJ is having a conversation with J. Edgar Hoover (Stephen Root) about keeping the Jenkins affair under wraps.  Johnson says he had no idea Jenkins was gay and asks Hoover (discovered to be gay) how you know when someone is a homosexual.  Hoover tells LBJ by the way they walk, dress, speak.  Somehow Cranstons LBJ looks at Hoover with an all-knowing expression.  Perfect.",1483142400,,3031,4.97808764940239

As with many of these kinds of movies, the arc of the script tells us more about the creators current social and political views than it does about the history it purports dramatize.  Anyone who has read anything about Lyndon Johnson or the times will immediately recognize the overwhelming license the writer takes with characters and events.

2217587,5,B0007LBLWS,"Everybody wants power, and if they say they don't they're lying. After the assassination of President Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson (Cranston) takes over and immediately goes to work on a Civil Rights bill. He throws everything he has behind it and loyalty, friendships and alliances are forged and lost in his quest for this dream. This is a movie that is right in my wheelhouse. I love politics and history, particularly the JFK assassination. I was really excited about watching this one. The movie takes place immediately after the assassination and doesnt hold anything back when it comes to Johnson. His paranoia, inadequacy, harshness and rudeness is fully on display. That really adds to the overall accuracy of the movie. Cranston does such an amazing job in this role that it is hard to actually believe it is him. The movie does an almost flawless job of showing the enigma that is President Johnsons quest for Civil Rights. On one hand everything he is fighting with everything he has to get equality, which is extremely admirable and is something to be commended. On the other hand, the way in which he does it makes enemies out of just about everyone, and leaves him unhappy and still paranoid about his legacy. As a reader and avid fan of history this movie seemed very accurate and because of that I highly recommend this. Overall, one of, if not, the best TV movie ever made, Cranston is incredible and this is one of the best historical movies I have seen. I loved this, but again, this is in my wheelhouse. I give this an A+.",1472515200,3,1538,4.678966789667896

2217591,2,B0007LBLWS,"The LBJ of ""All the Way"" isn't real. He's fantasy, a Hollywood rendering of the president we wish we had. Having read numerous biographies (including Caro's Pulitzer prize winning work) and dozens of other non-fiction work on LBJ and his time, I found it impossible to watch ""All the Way."" Cranston is great, yes. But as a portrait of an American time and an American president, ""All the Way"" is hopelessly false.

Rather than watch this sanitized, feel-good portrait, read some of the excellent biographies and histories that have been written about Johnson and the civil rights era. You will find that the real Johnson stole elections and murdered those who opposed or hindered him. Johnson cared about others only to the extent that he could dominate, control, and use them. Solely for political reasons, Johnson escalated US involvement in a war that devastated two nations. LBJ was the well-paid servant of powerful financial interests such as Brown and Root (now Halliburton). He was driven solely by ego and lust for power, and left devastation in his wake.",1470268800,5,1064,4.977528089887641

Bryan Cranston transforms into an incredibly convincing LBJ, right before your very eyes, and the screenwriting is nuanced & subtle. The production focuses entirely on LBJ's positioning on the Civil Rights Movement, & barely even mentions Vietnam or the Cold War. But you can't do justice to an entire era in a 2 hour movie -- and what is shown in this film is set forth at a very high level. It's funny and intelligent.

I couldn't stop watching his awful performance.  Melanie Griffith is very good as Barbara.  And there's also Jilly and Mickey Rudin.  Some of it is fact -Sinatra's famous trip to Australia and refusal to apologize.  The rest all seems very, very made up but it's fun to watch.  The guy singing Frank's songs is bad too.  The best part of the movie is Frank's refusal to apologize and his making it worse each time with more insults.  Like this comment: ""I have some regrets.  I got off the plane"".

WE paid for, what we thought were 3 episodes, but it was really one movie, a trailer, and how they put the makeup on Bryan Cranston. Not cool. Unclear. Wish we could get our money back and just buy the movie. Seriously, Amazon!",1518998400,,282,4.339622641509434
8048112,5,B0007LBLWS,"Bryan Cranston INHABITS LBJ! Cranston's face magically disappears as LBJ before my eyes. I too lived this history... I was in Washington as a kid.  LBJ was a Bull. A crude and forceful man and a driving force as a politician-he knew everyone in Congress and what each were afraid of--he understood where they lived, how to get over on them. He was that kind of guy. I watched ALL THE WAY on TV at first release and I gave it five stars because this is a better production overall than other, recent depictions. The writing-what aspects of the man are depicted; Cranston's make up (a true success but Cranston has obviously...spent weeks IN IT, to get it right. Additional character development:  Cranston shows you the disdainful, scheming and manipulative LBJ with his underlings and lesser cohorts (a stunningly immersed Bradley Whitford-and dogged determination with a smidgen of respect to his adult congressional mentor-played by Frank Langella. Whether you did or especially if you didn't know of LBJ--this is a great history lesson, well produced and accurately told.",1518825600,,1074,5.02808988764045
8048113,5,B0007LBLWS,"Cranston looks, sounds and acts exactly as I recall LBJ did.  It's unbelievable.  It's on par with Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln.  BTW, LBJ was a total slob and it shows in the movie.  But that's history",1515715200,,212,4.5
