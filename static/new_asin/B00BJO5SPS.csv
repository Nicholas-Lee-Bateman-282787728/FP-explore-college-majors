THIS IS A MOVIE YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN",1373500800,2,97,3.260869565217391
5635398,4,B00BJO5SPS,This movie is very encouraging and clearly shows how God continues to turn even past decisions for our good and His Glory! I really enjoyed the movie and the message walks out a set back is nothing but a set up for a comeback.,1372636800,2,226,4.159090909090909
5635399,5,B00BJO5SPS,"This is one of those wouldn't-it-be-good-if-life-worked-out-like-that movies. The story is principally about faith, love, and endurance. I like the FACT that the black men in the film were not angry or connected to some gang. I like that the movie showed the universal humanity of us all in a clean, self-supporting environment.",1372464000,11,328,5.326923076923077
5635400,4,B00BJO5SPS,"Bought it to send to friend and daughter.  Movie was mainly filmed at my mother's house and other places around Wilmington, NC, not Savannah, but they did a good job of making you think it was Savannah.  These places were my old stomping grounds, so watched it numerous times.  Understand why, but a shame they downplayed the real beauty of the house.  The friend I sent it to grew up across the street...both being the same age.  This movie is not for anyone that likes most of the horrendous movies made nowadays...but for those that enjoy nice, clean dialogue!",1372204800,6,563,4.646464646464646

I watched Somebody's Child on GMC (Gospel Music Channel) months ago. It left me thinking about how God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose - Romans 8:28. It is a touching movie.",1368576000,13,505,4.549450549450549

5635448,3,B00BJO5SPS,I enjoyed this movie very much. It by no means is a block buster movie. However the acting by Lynn Whitfield is always good and the supporting cast members did a good job as well. The story line was not strong and fairly predictable. What made this movie enjoyable for me was that it was very heartwarming. A dying mothers wish for her son's to come together as family. It actually a bit sad that she would not be alive long enough to really enjoy the fruition of her wish.  If you're looking for a heartwarming story that will make you examine your own family relationships then this is the movie for you.,1426809600,3,606,4.3628318584070795

The storyline flows very well in every scene telling a story of man who overcomes some obstacles in life without knowing who his biological parents are but came to peace with the fact that he is ""Somebody's Child"".  This is definitely the movie to buy to keep as part of your collection and why spend all of that money on expensive Christmas gifts when you can give this movie as a gift to a few friends and family members that they will undoubtly enjoy.  This movie touches and moves your soul, teaches you the greatness of second chances, that with just a little faith and positive changes in your life that blessings will surely start raining down on you.  It teaches you how to evaluate your past and view it as a positive teaching tool.  There is no profane language and no obscene nor sexual scenes in this movie.  Young and old will certainly enjoy this movie together.  Your family and friends will cry and laugh. I've watched this movie at least 6 times since receiving it recently and I'm still not tired of it.  They need more writers and movies like these to teach young and old about how a little faith can move mountains in due time.

5635509,5,B00BJO5SPS,One of the best story line I've seen in a long time. Very touching I would definitely recommend this one for any age and a real good family movie. Very clean no sex or profanity which is rare these days. All I can say is enjoy!,1377388800,,227,3.9565217391304346
5635510,5,B00BJO5SPS,This movie was simply wonderful: a moving story made even more touching by the outstanding acting of the entire cast.  All of the characters were so empathetic and funny and enjoyable to watch.  I laughed out loud several times just because of the funny expressions and actions of the characters - all real and not stilted or stiff (especially see the hand-clasped prayer of the couple in the restaurant).  This story makes you want to love your family and thank God for all His good blessings.,1376611200,,494,4.72093023255814

5635515,5,B00BJO5SPS,"I usually don't comment about the quality of movies that I've viewed online, but with this one I've decided to make an exception. First, I loved the concept of the story line and I think that it was well written, acted, and that the flow of the movie was well orchestrated from scene to scene; from beginning to end. NEVER a dull moment! At least in my humble opinion. Besides the exceptional story line, there were three additional things that I appreciated about this movie. 1. The mostly all black cast. 2. The wholesome, good-feeling, I can watch this movie with my family theme. 3. Finally, the fact that this movie had a spiritual and life message that could be received by both young and old. I must say, that I have developed a quiet confidence with the movies that I've seen that were created and produced by ""One Village Entertainment,"" and ""Swirl Productions."" I know that they're not littered with profane language or sexual overtones, and that there is always some type of spiritual and life message that is nicely weaved throughout the movie. These two growing companies are creating a brand that truly sets them a part from the rest. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to watch something that is well put together, with good acting, and a great message with a powerful ending.",1373587200,43,1300,4.681222707423581
