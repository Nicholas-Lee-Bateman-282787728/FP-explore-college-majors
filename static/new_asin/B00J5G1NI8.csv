8648305,4,B00J5G1NI8,"HARPIES

I absolutely love SYFY Channel movies, especially ones made by filmmakers I like. This one in particular was made by Josh Becker who is part of the Michigan crew with Bruce Campbell, Sam and Ted Raimi and Rob Tapert. The flick was also Executive Produced by Stan Lee so this movie had a lot going for it in my eyes. Plus I also liked other films the writer wrote.

The story is very Army of Darkness which makes sense since this is from one of that crew. The story follows a man named Jason who is a loser, a jerk, and a womanizer who is sent back in time to the middle ages. It is there that he learns he must find two crystals that he needs in order to get back to his own time. Things will not be that easy as the evil Lord Castor has plans of his own for the stones.

This is a great flick but a bad one if that makes sense, a great bad flick. Stephen Baldwin is great in his role as the cocky jerk who becomes a hero as are all of the actors here, well maybe not all. Director Josh Becker [Alien Apocalypse, Thou Shalt Not KillExcept, Running Time] I can tell he was having fun with this flick. Same can be said for writer Declan OBrien who gave us flicks like Snakeman, Wrong Turn 4 & 5, Joyride 3, and The Marine 3 & 4 as this movie is just dumb fun. I really wish we would have gotten a commentary from these two and a behind the scenes feature or something.",1517702400,,1375,4.010948905109489

I'm not sure it's intended to be funny, but this low-budget SciFi can hardly be anything else.
Between the horrible CGI, the ridiculous storyline, and the infamous Steven Baldwin, this is a classic in our house.",1456185600,,257,4.733333333333333

8648309,1,B00J5G1NI8,"Even for a Scy Fy Channel production, this film was dreadful. Somehow the lack of production value and the stupefied performances were supposed to make this into a comedy. There was nothing funny about it. From the lack luster effects to the nonexistent sets to the tragically witless script, the director started with a steaming  pile of it. And that was what he cooked up and served. The only thing missing was a side order of dead rats to choke down with and extra large mud milk shake. I like low budget movies. I like monster movies. There is nothing more monstrous than bad film making disguised as comedy. I suppose a really hateful teacher could inflict this on a class as to how NOT to write, direct, or act, in a movie. But, nobody would sit through it long enough to learn anything positive.",1405468800,,802,4.531034482758621
8648310,2,B00J5G1NI8,"Giving this movie a 2 was a bit charitable. The plot was silly. The costumes also silly, especially when you consider that the characters almost never changed costume! The harpies were pathetic: a child would not have been afraid. So why a two? I guess because there is a small chance the makers were going for camp, and if so, they moderately achieved it.",1405468800,,356,4.578125
8648311,3,B00J5G1NI8,The special effects where bad the Harpies they could have been A bit better. The cast was alright Stephen Baldwin did I think an excellent job for what he had now his female costar she had A fire in her I liked.,1404777600,,211,4.0476190476190474
8648312,2,B00J5G1NI8,"This is a 2007 Sci-Fi Channel movie that apparently no one wants to take credit for (the DVD cover is bereft of any information regarding this film).  It stars Stephen Baldwin as a disgraced cop now working as a guard for a museum.  The bad guy, in a dual role, is Scott Valentine.  I think they were trying to make a comedy of this, not unlike Army of Darkness.  Baldwin's character is sent back in time through a vortex, he makes an inauspicious landing in a pig sty.  Since he has all his modern day weapons (and a magic amulet), he's deemed the chosen one sent to battle the harpies and their master the evil Vorian (played in typical fashion as a cackling loony by Scott Valentine).  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I did laugh a couple of times but I'm not certain I was meant to.  This is a very low budget production.  Half the time the characters couldn't remember to use their accents, the rest of the time they slipped into colloquial jargon that made no sense for that time period.  The dialog wasn't funny (if indeed it was meant to be).  The acting was cringe worthy on everyone's part.  Cheap sets, cheap costumes, they didn't waste any of their budget on the production design.  I don't know what their intention was but the results are a sad coalition of incompetence.

In the realm of ""it's so bad it's good,"" this film is just plain awful.",1403827200,5,1359,4.409638554216867
8648313,1,B00J5G1NI8,"I got this film because I am a fan of Stephen Baldwin.  Ouch, got burned here.  The movie is terrible.  The Harpies look ridiculous and just stand and squat hissing and waving hands with long fingernails.  Their teeth are all long and hang a inch or two below their lower lip - they couldn't open their mouths to eat.  They are really phoney looking and don't look threatening at all.  The swordfights are really bad, don't look real.  It is a bad movie.  Even if they meant it to be campy they didn't succeed. This is a D or lower movie.  Sorry
Stephen this is a stinker!",1403136000,5,572,4.271028037383178
