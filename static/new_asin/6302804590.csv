516358,4,6302804590,"Horton Foote's play 'The Travelling Lady' comes to the movies in this 1965 film featuring Lee Remick and Steve McQueen.  It's an underrated film, ignored more because of its downbeat, deep sadness, probing one of the downsides of the American dream, than because of its quality.  The performances of the lead, particularly the sensitive and radiant Remick, stand up well in the 90s.  Her portrait of a disillusioned but hopeful young wife and mother is touching and memorable.  McQueen's jailbird is another fascinating characterisation - but no happy endings here.  END",901843200,13,570,5.21978021978022
516389,5,6302804590,"Steve McQueen and Lee Remick..they should have made a dozen more films together. This is a vastly underrated piece, and it is excellent in  very way. The camera work is so accomplished,  in every scene, and the score to this film! What a wonderful inspiration it conveys. Buy this and watch it over and over.

516390,5,6302804590,"BABY, THE RAIN MUST FALL is an interesting if uneven character study with Steve McQueen as a man who cannot escape his demons from the past who set him on the wrong path in life. McQueen is a drifter and paroled convict who dreams of songwriting and meets up with his small daughter and wife (Lee Remick) in Columbus, Texas in the the early 60s. The tumbleweed and dust blown environment seem to eat away at McQueen along with the terms of his parole and some dark secrets from his childhood. Elmer Bernstein's sensitive, vibrant and psychological score heighten the complex narrative.

Don Murray and Paul Fix gives strong supporting performances as deputy sheriff and judge and they add great depth to the texture of this forgotten film directed by Robert Mulligan. The screenplay is by Horton Foote based on his play, ""The Traveling Lady"" and produced by Alan J. Pakula. The team of Pakula and Muligan gave us some interesting films.",1453766400,2,936,4.777777777777778
516391,5,6302804590,"I was surprised at the great job McQueen did with this role. He actually had a nice singing voice & learned just enough to make it look as if he was in control of the instrument. Surprisingly or rather not surprising the critics were not thst kind to him. After reading his autobiography & learning what a terrible life he led he turned into the mega star must actors want to achieve & at one time was the highest paid actor of all time. He plays this role well but was not particularly overjoyed with it. He turned down some outstanding films & one cannot figure out why since he did it all so well. He is suave, charming.and the most polite actor on the screen. Writers do not ""write in"" politeness  but he always showed respect & affection. Perhaps this was because he did not receive it himself growing up. My heart ached for him to read about that awful childhood & maybe that is why he was who he was!

This wasn't the best McQueen flic I've seen, actually I'm not a huge fan like some folks, but the struggles he goes thru to achieve his dream are really heartbreaking, and the really mean old btch who ""raised"" him is why I remember the movie, and keep going back to it.  Her dying words have stuck w/ me ever since I saw Baby for the first time; never have heard such cruelty, spoken from a death bed.

516397,4,6302804590,"I liked this movie!  I don't think it got great reviews at the time it came out and I guess some people don't like it now.  I can see that it was not exactly Oscar material, but a very good story, nonetheless. OK, there are some holes in the script, but overall, the story and performances of all the major players are strong, yet sensitive.  And I just enjoyed watching Steve McQueen his blue jeans.  He was a very good looking guy with a killer body.  And I don't care if his lip-synced performance of the title song is sort of awkward...I think he did his best (but probably never did anything like that again.)  And then lovely Lee Remick gave it her best too, but I have to say, the chemistry between her with her sensitive and intelligent classiness and McQueen's brashness didn't make for the best on-screen chemistry.

woman on Judge Judy daily or Dr. Phil...stop standing by your looser man and take care of your kid properly and stop filling her with stupid love concepts that are not real. This is a weak attempt at East of Eden only with a step mother. There is no redeeming message to gain from this.

The performances are weak and wooden, and the story is dull and bland as it is black and white in an ugly dust bowl Texas town.. The music throughout suggests something shocking, suspenseful or halfway interesting should be taking place...but watching paint dry would be more entertaining and eventful. I was hoping for something interesting, considering the two talents involved, but it was just a pretentious outdated hum-drum mediocre mess which never goes nowhere. At times, the movie seems to be a test of endurance, to see how much you can stand to be bored before turning it off or fading to sleep..",1397865600,3,749,5.0
516453,4,6302804590,"Great to see the early potential of a great star, he had all the characteristics of James Dean, Paul Newman etc, plus he showed that unique mean streak that was to become a trade mark. Steve McQueen spent his whole life trying to prove a point and reach for greatness. He was definitely one of a kind, it will be long debated if he ever found true happiness. This is quite a dark moody movie, definitely won't appeal to everyone, but it is in it's way a classic, it should be judged for the excellent acting abilities of the major players.",1386720000,3,539,4.346534653465347

516457,3,6302804590,"Steve McQueen as the moves as a very talented singer in BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL. It isn't Steve's singing voice but he sure has the moves.
Henry Thomas (McQueen) has just been paroled from prison and his wife Georgette (The ever lovely Lee Remick) travels with their young daughter to finally be a family again. Henry is willing to work hard to support his family but he still wants to perform with his ""string band"" and he is amazingly talented.
The mysterious Miss Kate, an elderly woman who raised the orphaned Henry stands in his way.

BABY THE RAIN MUST FALL misses the mark as story about relationships. Henry and Georgette are trying to build a life together but Henry must play by Miss Kate's rules. Why does Miss Kate have this magical hold over him? He's is treatened with being returned to prison if he does not go to night school to learn a trade rather than perform with his band. It is all so confusing and a potentionally interesting story is ruined. Remick is a standout as the long suffering yet loving mother and wife who will do anything for her family. Don Murray is the local police deputy who grew up with Henry and wants to see the Thomas family thrive.

It's a good cast in a mediocre movie. The ending is a disappointing let-down.  So much potential is missed.",1342569600,2,1285,4.482905982905983
516458,2,6302804590,"I enjoy watching movies set in my earlier days of the 50s and 60s.  And I think Lee Remick was a most desirable woman.  However, Lee's demure beauty gave way to pity for the part she was given to play - a woman who takes it laying down.  Compare that to today's woman who would no way put up with the bad tempered, lazy, lying, cheating husband she had.  Even his lip-syncing sucked.

Not enough story, nor realism.  The old cars were the highlight of the movie.",1336176000,2,462,4.252873563218391
516459,3,6302804590,"I expected more from a screenplay by Horton Foote, frankly.  There are some lovely moments but the overall story is a downer.  Lee Remick is radiant and gives the film a beauty that makes it almost worth watching.  If you are a Steve McQueen fan then you will probably like it.  I found him odious from the beginning and it's hard to care about the story when you never develop a connection with the central character. Maybe it was the horrible singing. It's true that he was abused as a child which elicits our pity but the film should have given us something more about him to like if they expected us to care.

Don Murray is winning as the nice guy who stands by and watches helplessly as the drama unfolds.  I kept hoping for a happier ending that would have involved him, but it didn't happen.  The rest of the cast is fine.  The cinematography is lovely.

The film gives a fine sense of life in a small town in Texas in the '50s.  For that and the good performance of Remick I give it three stars.",1289347200,7,1003,4.2592592592592595

516461,3,6302804590,"This movie is a little slow by today's standards, and not really much of story. It's also a sad, haunting kind of movie. What I liked was the cast, which featured two of my all-time favorite actors: Steve McQueen and Lee Remick.

Remick plays an old-fashioned sweet woman that is rare to see on screen these days. It was not a glamorous role, but I don't believe she's ever looked prettier. Her unspoiled daughter in this film was a nice kid, too.

If this film just wasn't so darn depressing at times, I would have kept it. I sold it, but now kind of wish I had it back. Maybe three viewings were enough.  Then again, it does have McQueen (who sings!) and Remick, and those two keep drawing me back. Maybe I just keep hoping it will be better than it is; whatever, be prepared: the story is a downer.",1232323200,7,801,4.291390728476821

516465,5,6302804590,"This is my favorite Steve McQueen film (Sand Pebbles is a close 2nd). I don't understand why it isn't as well known among cinephiles as The Great Escape, etc.

Right up there with Marlon Brando's The Fugitive Kind. Both were films based on gritty stage plays. Both show the star at his best (my favorite Brando film is The Fugitive Kind, too). They share something else: both actors are portraying blues/rockabilly singers on the run. I've been on the run ever since I started playing music, too.",1114992000,14,496,4.7011494252873565

There are some very touching scenes in this picture, as well as some really depressing ones. Lee Remick did a marvelous job on this picture. The little girl was very good too. And last but DEFINITLY not least... Steve McQueen. I have to say, he was the most gorgeous man ever!! he looked absolutly stunning throughout this whole movie. He did amazing playing the drifting musician with a terrible past. You can really feel his emotions coming off the screen. This is one of the deepest and most depressing movie I have ever seen and this is a must!!!!",1094169600,26,810,4.406666666666666
516467,5,6302804590,"This movie is one I'd put up beside The Last Picture Show, A Small Town In Texas and a number of other portrayals of small town life in the US circa 1950s. The difference lies with the Remick/McQueen combo, the harmony, the tension and the incredible intensity of Steve McQueen at his absolute best.
The McQueen character here is a small-town young man from a lousy homelife, grown up, gone to prison for a brief time, poor and trying to make something of his life with his young wife, Lee Remick and their pre-school daughter, Margaret Rose. McQueen's past plays heavily against him; his hangups, pride, independence and general hard-headedness lead him into troubles with the entire town and the law enforcement community while the endearing Remick and Margaret Rose watch in tender helpless desolation.
This movie belongs on the best-seller list with all the other oldies.  It's a better one than most.",1084492800,64,905,4.915032679738562
516468,4,6302804590,"This is a very accurate portrait of not quite aquiring the American Dream.  An often overlooked gem, this film deals with misplaced passions and how they can affect the people you love.  I have to give Lee Remick the award for this one.  The long-suffering wife of an ex-con (McQueen), she portrays the quentissential southern lady who is trying to be optimistic, in spite of the hand that life has dealt her.  I went to school in Houston with the girl who played their daughter (Kimberly Block) and I remember when she was absent in Kindergarten to make this film.  Steve does a marvelous job in making us both feel sorry for the character and being quite repulsed at his antics.  But kudos have to go to Lee Remick on this one.

7831799,3,6302804590,"I understand this was part of the ""new wave"" cinema of the 1960s, and Steve McQueen made a career of playing ""crazy mixed up kids.""  Sometimes this worked, others not so well.  This is definitely one of the latter.  There are a few poignant moments, and I tried to feel some compassion for ""Henry Thomas"" with his ambitions and his tortured past.  But he still comes across as a creep bringing misery to those around him.  I've seen more than one real-life Henry Thomas evolve through the decades: hair and beard grow longer, belly bigger, substance abuse deepen, criminal record lengthen until some unhappy ending.  That's the fate I see for this man as his path and his wife's diverge at film's end.  Of course every McQueen movie has an ""escape"" scene.  This was his signature; unsuccessful this time.  As a low budget on-location film it provided an interesting real-life slice of 1960s America in landscape and culture, and a vehicle for McQueen and Lee Remick.
