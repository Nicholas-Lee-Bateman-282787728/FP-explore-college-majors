Dream a Little Evil (1990) *
D: Royce Mathew
C: Michelle Gaudreau, Richard Sebastian, Lyle Waggoner
P: A staple on USA's Up All Night. A computer geek creates the woman of his dreams on a computer, but things turn sour when she turns into a murderous demon.

Dream a Little Evil is a no budget cross between The Exorcist and Weird Science; a confused and uneven effort. At times, its a domestic drama about two feuding brothers. At other times, its a campy horror flick complete with low.....low...low...low budget effects. At other times, its gratuitous soft core erotica. And at other times, its a perfectly cheap teen sex comedy.

The entertainment value that the viewer will derive from watching this film will depend entirely upon the viewer and what frame of mind this film is caught in. At the very least, Dream A Little Evil has the requisite amount of boobs, sex, violence and even a dash of homo eroticism that you would expect of a trashy late night horror film.
