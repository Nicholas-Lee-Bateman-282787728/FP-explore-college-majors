8330745,4,B001OLKZP4,Excellent video! Both forms are laid out in staged sequences with detailed explanations of each technique followed by practical self-defense applications for each sequence. I've been training in Martial Arts for over 40 years and Bob ORLANDO's method of teaching mirrors my own. Bob has brought me into his world of Kuntao Silat and I'm hooked.,1465084800,2,344,5.160714285714286
8330746,5,B001OLKZP4,"As all the videos presented by Bob Orlando, this video is also superbly produced with very clear presentation verbally and visually. I highly recommend this video to any person interested in enhancing their knowledge and training on close fighting.",1342742400,3,248,5.384615384615385
8330747,5,B001OLKZP4,"The description is very good and the datails are there! your combat skill will have one very interesting boost here!
The two Combat Forms are fresh and effective...Good Job Bob!!",1322697600,2,178,4.966666666666667
8330748,5,B001OLKZP4,"Up there with Remy Presas of Modern Arnis and Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming of YMAA, who teaches Chin Na, Shaolin White Crane and Tai Chi, Bob Orland's videos land in my favorite group as far as Martial Arts video training is concerned. I have seen many videos concerning many arts such as Kali/Escrima/Arnis, Silat, Hapkido, Krav Maga, Chin Na and Tai Chi Chuan and many others. There are few out there that can convey their art into video form with limited time. Bob Orlando's best asset is his ability to capture the art of Silat and teach it in a common sense form that's easily digestable. This is certainly a recommended DVD for the new Silat student.",1268438400,4,648,4.594827586206897
8330749,5,B001OLKZP4,"I own numerous forms videos, but these are absolutely two of my favorites! The Fighting Forms of Kuntao Silat are very fluid, but incredibly practical. Not only does Mr. Orlando break the forms down from several angles to make them easier to learn, but he goes into great detail to share his knowledge on the applications, concepts, and principles within the forms. Then, as if that wasn't already enough, there is a surprise scene or two that are absolutely hilarious. I won't ruin it for you, but you would just have to see those scenes to appreciate them.

Obviously, for those who have trained with Mr. Orlando in person, they get the best of both worlds. Hands-on training with Mr. Orlando is absolutely the way to go and the videos are great as an addition to their training and for reference. However, if you have not been able to train with Mr. Orlando in person, this is definitely the next best choice. These videos are worth their weight in gold.

My best,

8330750,5,B001OLKZP4,"There are hundreds of videos on Silat and Kuntao out there, with more coming out every month. It's easy to spend a lot of money on something that wasn't worth the box it came in. However, if you are looking for some serious insight into the Indonesian martial arts, Bob Orlando's ""Fighting Footwork of Kuntao and Silat"" and ""Fighting Forms of Kuntao-Silat"" are the perfect place to start.",1236902400,4,388,4.720588235294118
