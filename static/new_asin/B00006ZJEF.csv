1795961,1,B00006ZJEF,"I don't care what this instructor is saying from Hollywood, I've spoken with 7 different doctors who do not agree with her workout philosphy, this workout is not safe for pregnant women. It is a good workout, but it is not safe, thus it can't be effective.",1048636800,7,256,4.468085106382978
1795962,5,B00006ZJEF,"I think this video is not only perfectly safe but effective too.  My doctor used it through her pregnancy and I got my copy at her office.  She was so impressed with her results that she now offers/sells both of Melinda's ""Pilates for pregnancy"" and the ""Pilates after pregnancy"" video's there and all of the women that I have met who useses the video's has the same thing to say.  We all love it and are all very happy and feeling great!  I am in my last few weeks now so I am not as mobile but still can perform some of the modified excercises.  I need to do Melinda's program even if it is just ten minutes a day or I feel bogged down and lazy.  The women who have already had their babies that I have gotten to know are continuing to use the program or have moved on to the ""Pilates after Pregnancy"" video.  We call our selves the Melinda Pilates gang.  We are all very happy with our results and highly reccommend all of Melinda's videos.  And I cannot wait to get to the day where I can do Melinda's ""Pilates after pregnancy"" program and then progress to her ""Pilates for everyday"" series.  This is a 10 star Pilates program and Melinda really is the best.",1047340800,2,1162,4.240909090909091
1795963,5,B00006ZJEF,"Great energy, great tempo, great program and great fun!  I love Melinda and I love her videos.  Although I have not had the opportunity to be thought by Melinda, (normally she is kept busy by celebrities too big to be named) I have been an on and off client at one of Melinda's centers in West Hollywood since 1992.  Melinda has been healing, teaching, training, and certifyiny other teachers since way before people could even pronounce the word Pilates.  She was actually one of the two people who held the trademark on the word ""Pilates"" up until about 2 or 3 years ago.
I travel a lot since I am a buyer for Nordstrom and have been pleading and begging for her to put out some Pilates videos so I could do Pilates on the road.  I am 41 and had my second Pilates daughter, which was made easier than my first due to Melinda's program.  I just started the After Pregnancy program and I look and feel younger, stronger, and sexier than ever.  My husband hates to go to gyms and fitness centers so I got him Melinda's ""Pilates For Everyday"" program and it has replaced his TV channel flipping, and I can see his beer belly slipping away.  He does the video program 20 minutes per day, 3 day per week.  It is good to be a mother again at 41, and I can honestly say that without her videos I would not be smiling so happily right now.",1046995200,3,1332,4.274900398406374
1795964,1,B00006ZJEF,"the video had potential, but it does not compare to the type of workout I can get at my health club. There, I know the teacher can correct me if I do somehting wrong, and this video tends to put me in positions that do not seem safe or what my doctor would recommend. I'm a little afraid to do it again, as the routine was not what I need to do with a baby in my belly.",1046736000,,369,3.7435897435897436
1795965,5,B00006ZJEF,"I wish this video had been out when I was pregnant, however, I did use it postpartum and thought that it was a wonderful way to get back into the rigor and flow of a regular Pilates workout.  It enabled me to feel as if I was truly getting some exercise but not going too fast.  If I decide to have another child I will be certain to use this video from the beginning of my pregnancy.  It was clear and easy to follow and the background music was great!!",1043712000,7,454,4.022222222222222
1795966,5,B00006ZJEF,"I love it!  It is a cutting edge pregnancy workout program.  It is easy to follow and I see the results.  I have completed my pregnancy and delivered a beautiful 7lb, 7oz baby boy and continue to use the video 2 to 3 times a week.  I gained about 49lbs during the pregnancy and in just 11 weeks I have lost 41lbs.  My only question is, when is Melinda's next video coming?",1042156800,7,372,4.111111111111111
1795967,5,B00006ZJEF,This DVD has helped my wife both physically and mentally.  A comfort and joy to any woman.  You should be so fortunate to discover the calm and informatable teachings of Jill Cassady!,1223164800,,183,4.6875
1795968,5,B00006ZJEF,"Sounds cliche but it's true- this really works!!! I used this DVD throughout both my pregancies and it was a lifesaver for my body!  It really made me feel great and got me back in shape quickly!  Easy to use, with clear instruction!  It's a must have!!",1213056000,4,253,4.340425531914893
1795969,1,B00006ZJEF,Most of the exercise are done on your back - which you are not supposed to do after the first trimester. Complete waste of money.,1207699200,,129,4.2
1795970,3,B00006ZJEF,"I've been doing this DVD for several  of months and have really been enjoying it...there's good focus on form and the slower pace has also allowed my inflexible husband to participate in my prenatal work out.  Unfortunately, there just aren't enough modifications for my growing belly.  A good chunk of the video is on your back and now that I'm into my seventh month I just can't do it anymore.  In addition, my growing belly gets in the way more and more.  So this is a great video for early and mid pregnancy...especially for women who may just be starting Pilates or have been out of practice for a bit...but it's really not for 3rd trimester.",1189641600,,647,4.543103448275862
1795971,1,B00006ZJEF,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. It is almost exactly like Windsor Pilates, and the moves are not acceptable for women in their second or third trimesters. The cover says that it is ""for before, during, and after pregnancy"" but I would not suggest that any woman past about week 14 try this video. About one-third of this video involves lying flat on your back and doing regular Pilates abdominal work. Nowhere on the box nor in the DVD menu does it warn women about lying flat on their backs later in pregnancy; my MD was shocked when I told her about this video and suggested that I not do those parts. I was not at all happy with this product...and am selling this one back.",1169078400,,681,4.3700787401574805
1795972,2,B00006ZJEF,"I like the DVD, but it has a lot of moves you need to do on your back, which you're not suppposed to do after the first trimester. I found this disappointing b/c I want to continue to do Pilates througout my pregnancy.",1156896000,,218,4.093023255813954
1795973,1,B00006ZJEF,"Stilted instructor.  Annoying music.  *This* from the entertainment capital of the world?  Why is this on DVD when it doesn't let me skip past all the annoying intros?  Instructions are delivered separately from the exercises themselves, and after three of the exercises, I gave up and threw it away.  I have taken several pilates classes over the years, and this one is awful.",1147219200,,377,4.920634920634921
1795974,5,B00006ZJEF,"I have experienced the effects of using this video before, during and after pregnancy. It is fabulous. Truly, it is a workout that can be used anytime. Perfect for all stages of pregnancy and it will get you back in shape after the baby and keep you there. I give it my highest recommendation.",1129766400,8,293,4.444444444444445
1795975,3,B00006ZJEF,"I am not a big pilates exerciser, but thought I would give it a try.  I am currently 9 weeks pregnant.  There is no way I can do this DVD later on in my pregnancy.  There are too many moves where you have to lay on your back, which is a no-no in later pregnancy.  But for right now, I like this DVD.  It's a lot less impact than lifting my free weights.",1129680000,,353,3.780821917808219
1795976,1,B00006ZJEF,"I bought this DVD at my local book store a week ago. I'm only 8 weeks pregnant and wanted to start pilates again to keep in shape. From the very beginning this is a snoozer! I'm no expert in pilates, and do not mind an instructor taking her/his time to explain postures, but Melinda Bryan is very slow in her instruction and you can actually see that she's reading off of cue cards! I find it very distracting. Each pilates exercise is also broken into individual segments- it has no flow from one posture to another. I actually had to turn it off before it finished. If you still would like to purchase this DVD, make sure you can return it for a refund or exchange. I made the mistake of buying it from a bookstore where I couldn't do this. Now I'm out $16 and have a DVD I'll never use again...",1128902400,,797,4.215686274509804
1795977,2,B00006ZJEF,Have not tried Pilates before.  Tried three times to get through this video and kept getting annoyed by the lengthy explanations that preceded each exercise.  Just could not get into this one.,1127001600,,192,4.96875
1795978,5,B00006ZJEF,I own several Pilates videos like this - this is definately the best one I have seen so far.  Easy to understand and follow.  Great instruction - and is divided into 5 seperate workouts so does not get old.  Also has by far the most professional look to it. Strongly recommend.,1124841600,9,277,4.392156862745098
1795979,3,B00006ZJEF,"I am in my third trimester and picked this title up, along with Shiva Rea's pregnancy yoga.  I started Melinda's DVD first because the packaging looked like it would provide a good workout.

As the previous reviewer says, the actual workout shows a non-pregnant woman (as least visibly) doing the exercises.  I felt pretty let down - anyone who's ever been pregnant knows how awkward it is to have a 30lb basketball strapped to your stomach and to see her and her flat stomach doing things that I'd require a crane and forklift to get my body to do, was kind of absurd.

Also, almost every piece of modern literature on pregnancy cautions against lying on one's back for any extended period of time, because the weight of the baby presses down on the major veins that carry blood and oxygen to the baby (and to the mother).  If you already have problems with dizziness, low blood pressure, and breathing, this is a major concern.  Yet the very first thing she does is lay flat on her back.  That really lowered her credibility in my view - combine that with the lack of any modified exercises or use of support props says to me that someone went and made a regular Pilates DVD and then slapped the title ""Pre-natal"" on it.  I'd be curious what doctors and physical therapists would have to say upon watching this.

I'm giving this three stars rather than one only because I feel like I haven't given this DVD a proper chance yet - plus it might truly be a great post-natal workout.  If you're looking for something specifically designed with the needs of a pregnant woman in mind though, skip this one.",1123545600,15,1602,4.53125
1795980,3,B00006ZJEF,"I am currently in my third trimester and tried Melinda's Pilates For Pregnancy for the first time. Based on the cover of the DVD I thought she (or someone next to her) would actually be visibly pregnant for this video. I am comfortable doing Pilates normally, but I felt her workout did not have enough modifications for the 2nd or 3rd trimesters when your belly is big enough to not be comfortable on your back. I have to fast forward through quite a bit of the video in order to get to the spine, leg and arm work. Should be great for your 1st trimester and part of your 2nd based on your proficiency with Pilates, but you'll have very limited use for it in your 3rd.

I also own Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga and have found this workout to be much more geared towards a pregnant woman. Shiva does her yoga along with two other women, each of them representing (and actually are in) one of the trimesters.

I had bought a Pilates DVD hoping to get a good back workout, not a workout on my back.",1115769600,5,992,4.2712765957446805

The workout for after pregnancy looks good so far. I am anxious to try it after I give birth.",1115769600,17,1087,4.241545893719807
1795982,5,B00006ZJEF,"I bought this DVD during my 2nd pregnancy and hated it! I had been doing lots of pilates and yoga routines beforehand and wanted to continue strengthening my core muscles during pregnancy. I was a total couch potato during my 1st pregnancy and wanted to stay fit the 2nd time around. The tape though was too hard for me and I ended up selling it.

Now it's my 3rd pregnancy and I'm a little older, so much more determined to stay in shape! I saw the DVD is now a combo with the pilates after pregnancy and thought I'd try it just one more time--basically I figured I'd just make myself struggle through it! Well, perhaps I'm in better shape now or maybe I just dealt with it, who knows, but I absolutely love this program now! I'm 5 months pregnant and use this DVD every other day. It definitely isn't for wimps--I feel just as challenged as I did with my advanced pilates tapes I used pre-pregnancy. As for being on my back, it doesn't really bother me as I always wake up in the middle of the night on my back already, and there's no telling how long I've been there. I've also been told by our doula that the body will tell you when there's an issue, such as shortness of breath or feeling dizzy. In the beginning of the tape, there's a warning stating that if you do feel these symptoms to immediately get on your left side. The exercises did not bother me at all being on my back. I think you need to do what's best for you, as all women are different.

I say this DVD is worth a shot. If you don't like it, there's always resale.",1112918400,2,1536,4.203389830508475
1795983,2,B00006ZJEF,"I wish I read the review before buying it, but well, I'll wait until the baby's born to use it. I'm afraid to contract my abdominal muscles on every single exercise (wich you contract either want it or not).",1106524800,2,207,4.333333333333333
1795984,1,B00006ZJEF,The entire video is about exercises laying flat on your back which doesn't make sense to me at all. I am very disappointed that the modifications are useless too.(You are still asked to stay on your back.) I would not recommend this video to anybody.,1105920000,3,250,4.5777777777777775
1795985,4,B00006ZJEF,"I own quite a few non-pregnancy Pilates DVDs.  I really don't see much difference between this one and my other DVDs.  She does give a few modifications, but most of it is the same moves.  I'm not finding it to be uncomfortable (unless you count all of the times that I lay down and then sit up on the next pose...) really.  I probably didn't need this based on what I already had, but I really wasn't sure in advance if the moves were safe for pregnancy.  I would recommend it, but NOT if you already have other Pilates tapes.",1103587200,10,527,4.23
1795986,1,B00006ZJEF,I bought this tape and was surprised to find that the majority of it took place while lying on one's back. I asked my doctor (this was in Spetember 2004) and she said I should DEFINITELY not use it. So I don't. What a waste of money.,1098057600,2,233,3.978723404255319
1795987,4,B00006ZJEF,"Ok. First of all, the routine is a little boring. So, if you are a fitness nut who used to doing Taebo and spinning, then you may fall asleep. But for most of us pregnant women, I think its great.

I am 4.5 months pregnant and have never been a really committed exerciser, though I am in fairly good shape (or was). I wanted to do Pilates because it is low (no) impact and I don't have to worry about heart rate etc.

This thing about lying on your back really bugs me. First of all, the book is still out on that one. Secondly, you are not on your back for very long at one time before your back up sitting. I certainly find myself sleeping on my back for a longer period of time (in spite of pillows and wedges). Also, she keeps you moving all the time on your back, so I don't see, logically, how you can stop blood flow.

 I've only been doing this video a few days and I can feel that my muscles have gotten a workout.  I feel great. The first time I did the video my lower back was not terribly comfortable but the second time I had no problems whatsoever.

This is a quick, ""easy"" workout and I recommend it.",1097798400,,1115,4.045454545454546
1795988,4,B00006ZJEF,"When I first bought this video a year ago all the reviews were great.  Everyone was talking about how they bought it at their OB.  I think it is great too.  I did it up until I delivered and never had a moments problem.  Its funny how she says ""pull your navel to your spine""....like you can even feel the muscles there anymore!!  It was just nice to try!;)  My husband is a family practice physican and he did the video with me.  It was way harder for him than me!!!  He was sore the next day!!  As long as you use common sense (it hurts, don't do it) you will be fine.",1095984000,3,570,3.9734513274336285
1795989,1,B00006ZJEF,I watched this video about 1/2 way through and threw it in the trash.  I have been to many pilates and yoga classes over the years and am very familiar with the exercises.  As a pilates video by itself it is poor... the background music is not very calming but annoying.  And for a pregant woman I would not recommmend following these instructions even modified.  I agree 100% with my fellow 1 star reviewers.  Don't waste the money or your time.,1093392000,2,446,4.45679012345679
1795990,2,B00006ZJEF,"I agree with the others. Although Melinda claims you can do this workout throught your pregnancy, the majority of this workout is done on your back. According to ACOG, we should avoid exercising on your back starting at 20 weeks. Also, she doesn't count through some of the moves - especially frunstrating when some of the moves require you to be looking at the floor in order to be in neutral spine. The majority of the moves are similar to Windsor Pilates so if you already own Windsor, avoid this one and look for another pre-natal pilates DVD. I'll be checking out the newer Pilates in Pregnancy.",1093305600,2,600,4.616822429906542
1795991,5,B00006ZJEF,"I used this workout throughout my pregnancy and loved it.  I was doing Pilates for 6 months or so before I got pregnant so the moves were familiar. Yes this tape is a bit dull when you are in your early months, but trust me, when you are 30+ weeks pregnant, it will not seem so dull any more and the pace is just right.  As for those who say you should not exercise on your back after the first trimester, these days the wisdom has changed on that and many doctors say it is fine as long as you feel ok.  I used this workout until about 36 weeks and delivered a very healthy baby.  My delivery and recovery were both quite easy...not sure how much of that was due to Pilates, but I like to think it helped!",1093219200,,706,4.021428571428571
1795992,1,B00006ZJEF,"Like another reviewer, I had to double check to make sure that this is for pregnancy and not postpartum.  I got tired of waiting for me to get to exercises that I could do--ones that weren't lying on your back.  She gave modifications, but those, too, were lying flat, and she kept saying that only in your 3rd trimester you shouldn't do something, when you shouldn't be flat on your back from the 2nd trimester on.  She even had a special exercise for women in the 3 trimester to do--LYING ON THEIR BACKS!  I am very disappointed, and will have to hold on to this until after the baby is born--it is basically useless until then.",1088553600,2,630,4.405172413793103
1795993,1,B00006ZJEF,"This dvd is very bad for mothers in the 2nd or 3rd trimester.  Lying on your back puts all the weight of the uterus and baby on your lower spine.  This video begins by not only asking you to lie on your back, but it asks you to lift your pelvis at the same time (adding insult to injury).  The first set of exercises had me in so much pain, that I had to shut it off.  I turned it off and put on The Method prenatal yoga video, which causes me to feel BETTER, NOT WORSE!!  Finally, abdominal crunches are not safe during pregnancy.  This video asks you to do those as well. Stay away!!",1074556800,5,585,4.0
1795994,2,B00006ZJEF,"Halfway through this video, I actually rechecked the box to make sure it was for pregnancy and not post-baby!  The instructor spends at least half the time on her back (last I checked, this wasn't recommended over the 4-month stage) and does lots of uncomfortable poses.  She does offer modifications, but practically no advice about checking your own comfort level, not straining etc. which is standard in other prenatal videos.  Also, all that toe-pointing gave me foot cramps, which she doesn't address at all.
I also found her instruction to be less than helpful.  Several times she contradicts her own directions.  She also doesn't count through reps, so if you're not looking right at the t.v. (which you shouldn't do if you're following instructions) you don't know how fast or slow she's going.  Modifications instructions also drown out the main audio, so you have to wait to find out what's going on.
All in all, a sloppy job.  I was disappointed after reading others' positive reviews.",1069200000,8,996,4.963855421686747
1795995,1,B00006ZJEF,"I found this video to be totally against the grain, my obgyn does not like it and disagrees with the instructor on many points, pilates is good bu other workouts are better than this.",1068681600,4,183,4.411764705882353
1795996,1,B00006ZJEF,I was disappointed with this exercise video because so many of the exercises are on your back.  Once you are 6 or 7 months along it's just not comfortable or advisable.,1061683200,11,168,4.419354838709677
1795997,4,B00006ZJEF,I had done pilates before getting pregnant and it is great to have a video where you can continue some of the same moves (albeit modified).  I find this much more enjoyable than the Fit Mama with Liesa Hart.  I got very bored repeating the combination over and over without changes.  This tape helps stretch out my back and strengthen my stomach muscles -- I have not had any lower back problems and I'm at the end of my fifth month.  One word of caution -- take this tape slowly if you have not done pilates before.,1059350400,11,516,4.288659793814433
1795998,1,B00006ZJEF,"I waited in anticipation for this video. Got it and was thoroughly disappointed. You can't perform 95% of the exercises after the 3rd month of pregnancy as she begins each of them by instructing you to get on your back.(What was she thinking?) The exercises also appeared to be simply fruitless. But of course how would I know, I didn't perform any of the exercises. I just watched her and wondered, ""Now how in the world is that supposed to keep anybody firm?"" I simply put the tape in during my 5th month of pregnancy and felt totally taken advantage of for even spending the money.",1056758400,25,584,4.518867924528302
1795999,5,B00006ZJEF,"I think this is a great prenatal pilates dvd. I normally do pilates, so I found the moves to be consistent with some of what I would normally do.

Yes, there are floor exercises, but modifications are shown & you can always use a pillow- I would definitely recommend this to any  pregnant women who loves pilates!",1056412800,4,364,4.515151515151516

1796002,1,B00006ZJEF,"I've been doing pilates for about 1 1/2 years so I'm familiar with alot of the moves.  When I got pregnant, I wanted to to find a video that would enable me to safely continue pilates past the 1st trimester.  While Pilates for Pregnancy has all the classic pilates moves and good clear explanations, it was not helpful for me in that I could not perform these moves in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  Because I was uncomfortable laying on my back, I wasn't able to do a majority of the moves and I was disappointed to see that there were very few modifications for women in this condition.  I ended up showing this video to my pilates instructor who then showed me further modifications that do not involve laying on my back.  She also commented that some of these moves are a bit advanced for a pregnant women to perform.  I agree as even with some pilates conditioning, I could not comfortably do things like ""the corkscrew"" while pregnant.  If you're uncomfortable on your back or don't have a lot of experience with pilates, it would be much better to actually go to a pilates mat class and ask the teacher for modifications rather than buy this video.",1052438400,36,1153,4.488038277511961
1796003,3,B00006ZJEF,"I found this tape to be a pretty good overall workout. It doesn't feel like you are getting anywhere because it is more like an infomative lesson. I will continue to use it just because some of the excersizes seem to be beneficial. It doesn't have a smooth routine feeling though. It's like they just thought of some moves and made a demo tape. Also, it takes a minute to see the modified poses and she is halfway done with the pose by the time the modified poses come on the screen.",1050969600,,483,4.260869565217392
1796004,1,B00006ZJEF,"I would not recommend this tape.  I agree with the other comments that there are too many exercises done lying on your back, which is not safe.  They do have modifications for certain exercises but even the modifications are on your back - and they don't even show the modifications until after she performs the exercise.  There are not enough repetitions for each exercise.  The tape length is too short.  There are so many other pregnancy workout tapes out there.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1050537600,6,510,4.674157303370786
1796005,1,B00006ZJEF,"This video offers very little to women trying to modify their exercise routines appropriately for pregnancy. As other reviewers have mentioned, almost all exercises are performed on the back, making it useless except in early pregnancy. While it may provide some benefits to women in early pregnancy or postpartum, it is not rigorous enough for women who are already fit and hope to maintain their fitness levels. I found that there were too few reps of each exercise to provide me with any real benefit. I have had more success modifying the exercises in regular yoga and pilates videos.",1050364800,3,588,4.94949494949495
1796006,1,B00006ZJEF,"my doctor advised against this video for many reasons, i tried it and agree, it's not fun, safe, or wisely put together...it seems like it should be for normal or non pregnant people",1048809600,8,182,4.545454545454546
7973366,1,B00006ZJEF,"The first exercise (and second and third and so on...) has you lying on your back, which you're specifically not supposed to do past a certain point in pregnancy.  This DVD was completely useless to me.  AVOID!  Plus, the instructor is shown on the cover as being pregnant, but she isn't in the video.  I didn't like that.  Overall, this is NOT safe for pregnant women.  Please be careful and look elsewhere.  (I like ""Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix.""  Erin is pregnant in it, and she isn't totally wooden like Melinda Bryan.)",1369612800,,531,4.695652173913044
7973367,5,B00006ZJEF,"I bought this when I first got pregnant ( with my third). I used it faithfully 2-3 times a week. Boy, did I feel good!!! I did not stick out as much and so my back did not hurt like with the others. After the birth I regained my ab muscles back VERY quickly, YEAH!!! I did not use it with my fourth pregnancy and sooo wished I had. Now I am Pregnant again and am enjoying the benifits (again)!!!!!!!!!! I know people have complained that you are on your back alot,but unless you are feeling dizzy or numbness somewhere you are fine! My OB/GYN thought this video was just fine to be using. Enjoy!",1302134400,,595,4.182608695652174
7973368,5,B00006ZJEF,"I used this DVD to ease myself back into pilates after a rough first trimester of morning sickness - this was just what I needed!  A fan of yoga and pilates pre-pregnancy, I needed a way to get back into mind-body workouts but was not sure what exercises I could do, and did not want to spend money on costly classes.  The guidance and modifications offered made me feel comfortable with the exercises I was doing and I am enjoying the benefits of the workouts - energy, increased flexibility, and tone in my arms and legs!  It is inspiring to see how great the pregnant instructor looks at 30 weeks... I will continue to used this DVD through the rest of my pregnancy and after!",1284249600,,679,4.416
7973369,1,B00006ZJEF,"I am very familiar with Pilates, also a dance instructor and was anxious to try this dvd when I became pregnant with my 2nd child. I was very disappointed not only that the instructor did not appear to be pregnant, she seemed to have zero knowledge of fitness safety or modifications for someone who is pregnant. It is very dangerous and hopefully common knowledge that at any stage but especially in your 2nd and 3rd trimester to lie flat on your back. Basically the first 15 minutes of the workout is spent laying flat on your back. It is a danger to pregnant women and they should discontinue the sales of this workout.",1283299200,,622,4.513274336283186
7973370,1,B00006ZJEF,"This dvd set was a total waste of time and $$$-wish I had read reviews before buying it at Barnes and Noble.  It is just like any other pilates dvd, there are NO modifications for 2nd or 3rd trimester- you are flat of your back for a good 15 minutes!  It is common knowledge that women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters should not be flat of their backs.  I have 3 other pilates dvd's that I used before prgnency, I purchased this one b/c I wanted to be safe and have the benefits of pilates w/ pregnancy modifications.  I was very disappointed.  I tried to do some of it-but just got irritated- I also had some pains in my lower abdomin and when I got up off my back I was extremely light headed.  I wouldn't recommend this for a pregnant women in any stage of their pregnancy.",1267142400,,774,4.1610738255033555
7973371,4,B00006ZJEF,"The Mat Work and Standing sections are good, but there is a section entitled Chairwork that I didn't find useful. It really doesn't work you too hard, but I did feel it help to tone and tighten my lower body.",1244505600,2,208,4.225
7973372,3,B00006ZJEF,"When I bought this DVD, I already owned a couple of pilates DVDs I was quite happy with, but I wanted one that was already modified for pregnant women.  Specifically, I wanted exercises done while not lying flat on my back.  I was disappointed that this DVD showed most of the exercises done flat on the back and only briefly mentioned modifications if that was uncomfortable.  I could have just used the DVDs I already owned!  I gave it 3 stars since it was an ok pilates DVD, just not what I had in mind when I bought it.",1243555200,4,523,4.252525252525253
7973373,5,B00006ZJEF,"I have tried several different pregnancy workouts over the years and this is ""the one"" as far as I'm concerned.  I came into this (my 6th) pregnancy an avid pilates fan and searched for a video that would help me maintain my fitness level in a safe manner.  The video is instructive while well-paced.  It is segmented so that one may fit in a quick yet challenging work-out almost anytime there are a few spare moments.  I have found the modifications demonstrated by the instructor in her 3rd trimester to be quite adequate as pregnancy progresses.  I would highly recommend this for beginners on up.",1239580800,3,601,4.685714285714286
7973374,5,B00006ZJEF,I bought this video late in the pregnancy and wasn't looking for something too advanced.  This video provides a good workout without being too much.,1238198400,2,148,4.92
