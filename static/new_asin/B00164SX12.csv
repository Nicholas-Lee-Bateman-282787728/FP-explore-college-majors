8260847,5,B00164SX12,"Wonderful history of the South Pacific Coast Railroad that ran thru Silicon Valley from Alameda, CA, ""over the hill"" - as we locals call it - to the Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk. I grew up in Cupertino, CA when Silicon Valley was mostly farmland, fruit orchards were in abundance. I'm in my 50's and never heard of this rail line until I saw the documentary. This is a jewel, so glad I am able to show this to my friends, children and grandchildren. 500 stars!",1439337600,,462,4.383720930232558
8260848,4,B00164SX12,"One-Horse Railroad is a professionally produced video that goes into detail about the South Pacific Coast Railroad. I wish there were more video of the train ride, which is what I bought it for. It's a spectacular ride even today over the route from Felton to Santa Cruz. The ride through the tunnels must have been something else.

We also don't see all the existing tunnel entrances, but we do see a couple. I especially appreciated the personal accounts of riding the train to school from Laurel.

We see Bruce MacGregor on film, which is remarkable because he is the author of several books on the railroad. He tried, unsuccessfully, to generate interest in reviving the line.",1296950400,,680,4.803418803418803
8260849,5,B00164SX12,"I found this video wonderfully engaging, educational and entertaining.  Its a perfect gift for any railroad buff and a fascinating look into a little slice of California history. Interesting in-depth interviews with railroad historians and lively period folk music enhance the viewing experience.",1207699200,2,296,5.883720930232558
8260850,5,B00164SX12,"This documentary was informative, interesting, and obviously well researched. The background music was excellent, and I felt as if I were in a railroad museum theatre. Being a transplanted 'east coaster' to the California area in question, the history of this small, successful railroad was fascinating, and a tribute to the people who made it happen. A bit long, but well worth the time!

8260851,5,B00164SX12,"In spite of the title of ""The One-Horse Railroad"", this informative and well-crafted video is all about a short line that managed to be the most profitable railroad- per mile- in the State of California in 1887. The video provides the background of this success story, and a wealth of historical fact and lore about the remarkable South Pacific Coast Railroad.",1206316800,4,360,4.918032786885246
8260852,5,B00164SX12,A great resource for train enthusiasts and historians alike.  This documentary is entertaining and informative - it is clearly well-researched.  Good music and good storytelling.,1206316800,3,178,6.08
