8276390,5,B001A8HGB2,Worth it every penny.  Simple and detailed explanations plus bonus drills at the end of the instructional video.,1456790400,,112,5.222222222222222
8276391,5,B001A8HGB2,"I recommend the 8 DVD of the collection of this encyclopedia of BJJ carried out by D. Marcus Vinicius DI Luca.
All the information is perfectly structured, in a such way that, the teaching is very simple for the logic of the teaching method.
The explanations understand all the necessary details to understand all the explained movements perfectly.
In my modest opinion, the initial formation in JUDO of the Teacher Marcus Vinicius facilitates the teaching methodology a lot and it simplifies the understanding of its teaching a lot.
I believe that ALL the DVD of the encyclopedia is basic for all the people that already begin in BJJ, and a very good tool of consultation for people initiate.
For everything it, I recommend the complete purchase of the 8 DVD.",1414195200,,760,4.8538461538461535
8276392,5,B001A8HGB2,"To be honest, I've been training with Marcus at BHJJC for 5 years but I own and use his entire DVD collection.

As the other reviewer noted, these are basic chokes that any blue belt should know.  This is true and it is exactly what this entire DVD series is about.  It is not a collection of the newest, most exotic, high flying, aerial submissions.  If that is what you are looking for, why buy a DVD?  Just go to YouTube and watch hours of that stuff for free.  This DVD walks through the tiniest details of each choke (plus sweeps, takedowns, armlocks, passes, etc in the other DVDs).  As anyone who has trained in Jiu Jitsu knows, it is the details of the moves that make or break your ability to execute them during live sparring.  Marcus will help you build a rock solid core of jiu jitsu fundamentals to ensure that you have the knowledge and understanding to add more exotic techniques to, should that be the route that you want to go.

As I said, I've been training with him for 5 years and have had him teach me these techniques over and over and still I find useful tidbits every time I watch the videos.  These are especially great if you have to miss class for work/life/injury/etc. but want to keep the techniques fresh in your mind.

Marcus is a 5th degree black belt who has dedicated his life to Jiu Jitsu and his technique and insights will not disappoint you.  If you think you've seen everything he teaches, chances are you may ""know"" a bunch of techniques but aren't a master of many of them.  Study these DVDs and watch your game improve.",1329091200,,1561,4.378472222222222
8276393,2,B001A8HGB2,"Is a pretty good video, However anyone with a blue belt of higher should already know these chokes.  But its great review!",1240099200,,122,4.545454545454546
