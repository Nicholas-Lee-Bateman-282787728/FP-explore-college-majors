All that is found are salt foundations upon salt foundations.  The reasoning why Sodom and Gomorrah are thought to be in this area by the filmmakers is that one 17th Century map states that fact. Well, that's convincing!  Also, photos from outer space of the area supposedly depict an uneven terrain under the Dead Sea.

 I was looking for a video on S&G for classroom purposes. This isn't it. Mike Sanders, the leader of this trek, is definitely not a reliable guide. There are more interesting takes on the Bible in the work of Monty Python.",1312588800,2,713,4.546875
