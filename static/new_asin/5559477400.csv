206206,5,5559477400,"This Christmas, Big Idea has released their two Christmas episodes on one DVD.  This is great for those just finding the series since it will save them money.

First up is ""The Toy That Saved Christmas"" from 1996.  In it, Mr. Nezzer has convinced Dinkletown that they need to buy lots of his toys to make the season happy.  But one of those toys isn't buying it and sets out to prove that there's more to Christmas.

Being 8 years old, the animation is rather poor, but this is my favorite of the two on the disc.  It's a fun little story with catchy songs that clearly presents what Christmas is all about.  And anything with the ""Oh, Santa"" silly song is OK by me.  This release does include the extra animation they did to turn it into a full hour special for PAX TV.

Next up is 2002's ""The Star of Christmas.""  This episode finds the gang in Victorian England.  While Bob and Larry (as Calvin and Millward) are planning a Christmas spectacular, across town a humble little church is putting on a Christmas pageant.  When the two shows collide, watch out!

I'm not as big a fan of this episode in the series.  I think it tries to stretch too short a story into 45 minutes.  Still, it is VeggieTales and is entertaining with another great message about Christmas.

Between the two shows, this DVD has 90 minutes of entertainment on it.  And that's not counting the 2 hours of bonus features.  At the price of a normal DVD, if you are planning to get either of these stories this year, this is the way to do it.  You can't beat two for the price of one!  Anyone already owning them both on DVD will probably want to head right on by unless you want two copies of these fun Christmas specials.",1097712000,25,1694,4.334394904458598

In The Toy that Saved Christmas, we see the passion kids feel for that latest and greatest toy.  But what if the toy wants to know the real meaning of Christmas?  Combine action and adventure as the vegetables slide down a mountain and try to escape the toy factory with the real meaning of Christmas and you've got fun for the whole family.  In the Star of Christmas, we see the struggle with all the glitz and glamour of the holidays and the subtle truth of a little baby, a manager, oh, and a star.  With a rocket packed car, Bob and Larry in jail, and the humor of a Scottish carrot, how can you go wrong?",1321833600,,753,4.151724137931034

We love LarryBoy too.  All the videos contain a good moral message.  No violence, sex, drugs, or other adult themes that today's CARTOONS are INNUNDATED with.  Ever watch today's cartoons?  They are overwhelmingly filled with issues and characters I wouldn't want my teens to watch! Today's television for kids is pathetic and worthless.  It's so violent and out of control. Veggietales are a nice breath of fresh air for my 4 year old in a world gone mad.  By the way, My oldest is 19 and we were watching these when HE was 4.
