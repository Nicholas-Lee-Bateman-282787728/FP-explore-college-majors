2334921,5,B0009XRZS8,"Wow! I am terribly disappointed that I was unable to see this movie on the big screen. It wasn't available here on the west coast and so I had to wait till it came out on DVD in order to see it. This is a wonderful story about a boy and a cheetah (obviously) and I would certainly recommend it to anyone but especially if you are an animal lover. I found it to be quite touching and a must see. The acting on the animals and humans part is exceptional and although I find that I sleep right through most ""exciting"" movies, I was riveted to the screen throughout every moment of this film.",1147737600,20,588,4.121739130434783
2334922,5,B0009XRZS8,"I had heard that this movie was only released in Chicago theaters because the film industry felt that this movie would ""not be very popular"", they felt it would not be attractive to any age group...hmmmmmmmmm...Well, I am 23 years old and I thought this movie was excellent all the way around...better yet the cheetah was REAL, it wasn't a distorted looking computer animated cheetah, it was all real, shot on scene in South Africa...this film was truly authentic and amazingly beautiful, one of the BEST family films ever made!!!! I am disappointed that this film was never given a real chance at the box office, I feel it would have truly captivated children and adults alike...It deserved more attention than it got...GREAT film!!!!!",1147737600,20,736,4.943548387096774
2334923,4,B0009XRZS8,"This exquisite little love story about a boy and a cheetah was poorly advertised when it was in theaters.  It came and went and was overlooked by audiences.  It deserves remastering on Blu-ray  It is that rare thing, a true family film that is not insulting to kids or adults.

There is a fierce beauty to many of the scenes and close ups of the cheetah's face convey a kind of intelligence and dignity rarely seen on the screen or anywhere, for that matter.

The story is simple and remains true to the spirirt of the book.  The screenplay adaptation is lean.  But it is the extraordinary look of the movie that lingers in the mind.  It casts a spell. As does the regal grace of the cheetah.

This simple story has no profound revelations, but rather a reminder of the grace and beauty of our world. Without going into detail, I found the acting, locations, cinematography, music, and especially the directing to be of the highest order.

I highly recommend this wonderful gem of a film.",1147046400,117,988,4.531073446327683
2334924,5,B0009XRZS8,"Because this Film does not have sex, violence, vulgar languge is probably  why this was not released to the public.

When I was on a flight to China I saw this movie 3 times after I returned home I brought my family to see it in Washington DC about 200 miles away (the closest showing).

After the movie the whole audience stud up and cheered?

The theater was packed with familes just like mine?",1146614400,29,396,4.3108108108108105
2334925,5,B0009XRZS8,"this movie didn't really get any publicity, and the director was kind of on his last nerve. there were even debates on whether or not to put it out on dvd. they only put in out in chiago, and i feel like im one out of the myabe 100 people who saw it.

but this movie was breath-taking. everything about it was glorious and moving. i loved every minute of it. i really hope it picks up, or i just hope more people see it. it was so moving and certainly wasn't only a movie for children. it further shows the bond of human and animal in a beautiful atomesphere that anyone can enjoy.",1141603200,24,581,4.0964912280701755
2334926,2,B0009XRZS8,"The opening scene is highly improbable. The closing scene does not make the slightest lick of sense in the context of what's gone before in the story. In between, the title cheetah is little more than a prop and the human characters are completely two-dimensional. I was very disappointed in this film. If this is ""family entertainment"", then we must not expect our families to do much thinking about their entertainment.",1137888000,5,421,4.943661971830986
2334927,3,B0009XRZS8,"Our family had fallen in love with the book ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft on which the movie is based.  We were very disappointed to discover that the movie and the book have nothing in common other than they are about a boy named Xan and a cheetah named Duma.  There the similarilty ends.  The story in the movie is completely changed from the true story in the book.  The movie itself is OK, perfect for family viewing, with some beautiful shots of Africa.  The movie has none of the charm of the book and has a somewhat predictable ending.  It is really too bad as I think that the story from the book would have made a far better movie.",1137369600,11,650,4.201612903225806
2334928,5,B0009XRZS8,"I and my nine-year-old nephew saw this film today and it is a beautiful, intense film. I do not think its job was to teach us about race relations in South Africa, or anything political. It is a movie about family love and love of wildness. I did not place any larger burdens on it and I was totally enthralled by the movie, as was my nephew. Some parts were pretty intense and scary for a child, but for the most part he seemed to get a lot out of the movie and said he loved it. I loved it too. Cheetah's really need our help if they are to survive - the Cheetah Conservation Fund is the primary group working to save the Cheetah - their web site is a good place to learn more: [...]",1136678400,21,685,4.007299270072993
2334929,4,B0009XRZS8,"My son ""made"" us see this movie, and we're so glad we did!  Although there are some parallels to Fly Away Home (orphaned critters) and the Black Stallion (marooned far away from civilization), the story is completely different--somewhat predictable, but nevertheless pleasant to watch.  Probably no Oscars for acting here, but definitely worth our time.",1128124800,45,353,5.4
2334930,4,B0009XRZS8,"I just saw this movie with my 11-year-old son who watched it with rapt attention.  I agree it has many parallels to ""Fly Away Home."" But it will be a refreshing break for parents who endure the wasteland of children's movies and wonder what there is out there to engage and inspire our children rather than bludgeoning them with hyped-up animation, improbable superheros, and vulgar comedies.  Don't miss it if it ever comes to a theater near you.  We need to support movies that have some agenda other than fast-food tie-ins.",1128124800,16,526,4.758241758241758

2334955,5,B0009XRZS8,"I bought this movie in a desperate attempt to find anything cheetah at the request of my 8 year old. I expected her to love it because she loves everything related to cheetahs. After reading previous reviews, the entire family ended up watching the movie, and we loved it. The story follows a young boy who loses a close family member. Not wanting to lose one more thing he loves, he goes on an adventure to save his pet cheetah. I use the term pet loosely. It is a story about learning who you are, discovering your self worth, and learning the importance of family. I can't believe I had not heard of this movie prior to my random search on Amazon. This is a movie that all should watch! It did not get the recognition and promotion that it deserves!",1461801600,5,752,4.340425531914893

2335025,5,B0009XRZS8,"By far one of the best films ever made. A coming of age film which captures a depth of authenticity and power when one person sticks to their inner knowing not corrupted by outside influences and mandates.

Xan finds that his life growing up on the farm in the remote African wilderness is changed following the death of his father. His mother moves to the city creating a problem for Xan's pet Duma. Xan determined not to see Duma confiscated by the authorities and placed in a zoo, sets out on a heroic quest to release Duma back to the wild and the unfolding drama and encounter with wild nature is the dramatic backdrop of the entire story.

This is truly a beautiful and powerful story of what Joe Campbell called the Heroes Journey. With all the intrigue, danger, and fulfillment worthy of a story of this scope and magnitude.

2335084,4,B0009XRZS8,"I put off seeing ""Duma"" (2005) because, even though I like an occasional animal movie, I didn't expect ""Duma"" to have any depth. I was happy to be proved wrong. I should have expected no less from director Carroll Ballard, who's known for other artistic and meaningful animal films, like ""The Black Stallion"" (1979) and ""Never Cry Wolf"" (1983). Another thing I was pleased to discover is that ""Duma"" is more of a survival adventure than a kid's animal flick. Yes, we have the kid's pet cheetah, and also an accidental pet bushbaby (or galago), but the film's more about the two main characters than the animals.

The two characters happen to be Xan (short for Alexander), a South African boy who takes off from home to release his pet cheetah into the wild. The other character is Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker ), an African drifter trying to find out where he belongs in the world after some bad experiences. This relationship is the core of the picture. For a brief period of time these two stumble on to each other and it's a fortuitous meeting because they both have something the other needs, at least for the present.

The cheetah, the galago and the other numerous animals are great too, as are the awesome African visuals (shot in South Africa and bordering Botswana), but it's Xan and Ripkuna's relationship that gives the film depth and makes it absorbing. This makes up for a couple of eye-rolling parts, like the part where Xan is saved from some bullies at school.

So ""Duma"" provides the best of three worlds: amazing animals, awe-inspiring geography and some potent lessons to chew on. Add to this a notable diverse score by George Acogny & John Debney and you have a great or near-great animal film.

The film runs 100 minutes.

The story is a bit cliche, but compared to so much Hollywood family schlock out there, this movie is much better. It has a slow, relaxed feel throughout, with several moments of tension; not for those addicted to special effects or those looking for the nonstop excitement of, let's say, Jurassic Park. It very briefly and carefully shows a scene of lions killing a cheetah and also a cheetah bringing down an antelope and feeding on its carcass.

2335098,5,B0009XRZS8,"For me, Duma is the best of Carroll Ballard's films, and it has become one of my personal favorites of all time.  Shot on location in Botswana, this film is truly  - in the words of Manohla Dargis of the New York Times - ""soulful, piercingly beautiful.""

Coupla things......the film claims to be based on the book ""How it was with Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft and Carol Cawthra Hopcraft.  (I purchased the book shortly after I saw Duma for the first time a few years ago. This book deserves a read, it is absolutely fantastic, but I can no longer get the version that I have which is a beautifully bound paperback in color.  If you order the book on Amazon it will be the black and white version and it is awful.  You would need to order it through Barnes and Noble, they have the color version but it is poorly bound.)  It is the true story of a family who live on a farm outside of Nairobi and adopt an orphaned cheetah they name ""Dooms"".  He is so tame he chooses to live with them until his death years later.  Xan writes his memoir of growing up with Dooms who is already part of the family when Xan is born.  His recollections are through the eyes of a young boy.  It is precious, and the photos are astounding.

The film, Duma, is inspired by the book, but they changed most of the story.  The family lives on a farm in South Africa, and Xan is 12 when he and his father adopt an orphaned cheetah cub they find by the side of the road one night.  Duma lives with them until he is almost full grown.  Most of the film is the story of Xan's long journey with  perilous adventures through the African landscape - which includes crossing the Okavango River - taking Duma back to where they found him so he can live the life he was born to.  Along the way Xan meets a wanderer named Ripkuna and his Bush Baby, and they share the adventures together.  The cinematography is exquisite, and Ballard's touch makes you feel as if you are right there, nuzzling with Duma, keeping lions at bay with a good fire, racing through the rapids to beat the crocodiles, or just cruising down the river in the canoe at sunset, catching glimpses of hippos, elephants and giraffes.

Campbell Scott appears briefly in the beginning of the film as Xan's father.  The true stars of the film are Alexander Michaletos who plays Xan, Eammon Walker who plays Ripkuna, and Anthony, the cheetah.  Recently I Googled Michaletos and discovered that he grew up at The Farm Inn in Pretoria, South Africa, a hotel and wildlife sanctuary with 23 species of animals, so he was perfect in the part!  They even have a cheetah breeding program there -- and Anthony!  Guests can visit with Anthony and have their photos taken with him!  He's tame as toast.  You can find the Inn on Facebook.

Amazing what a little movie can do.  Duma has not only brought me, my family and many of my friends a lot of joy as a film, we are now planning our own adventure to travel 8,000 miles to visit The Farm Inn and Anthony in the next year!",1356134400,,2986,4.323741007194244

2335102,5,B0009XRZS8,"Once in awhile, I come across a little-known movie that is, in my opinion, a ""must-see."" Duma is such a movie.

Set in South Africa in the present day, 12-year-old Xan and his father nearly run over a baby cheetah while driving home on an empty stretch of highway one evening. They take the animal back to their South African farm and raise it as a pet. Xan mentions that when you give something a name, it then becomes your friend.  After trying to decide on a name, Xan finally decides to give his new pet the name of Duma, which is ""cheetah"" in Swahili. It isn't long before a wonderful friendship begins between Xan and Duma.

One of the things I enjoyed most about this movie is the portrayal of Xan's closeknit family. Xan's dad, Peter, is sure to teach his son all he knows about building things and taking care of a farm (which comes in handy later in the movie). Peter spends a considerable amount of time with Xan and, together, they test Duma's speed by racing alongside the animal with a stopwatch.  There is also a strong love and devotion between Xan's parents, even when they are in the midst of tragedy.

Duma is void of anything objectionable; however, there are several intense scenes that will frighten younger viewers. When Xan embarks on an adventurous journey and a promise he made to his father to return Duma to the wilds where he belongs, Xan encounters the harsh elements, wild animals, a stranger, and near death due to a lack of water and food. Parents will also want to discuss Xan's choice to leave on his own to help Duma find his way back to the wilds, rather than solicit his mom's help.

Duma is one of those movies that I hadn't heard much about, but that I am glad I purchased. Themes of family unity, forgiveness, loyalty, loving your neighbor, and grief all play integral roles in this movie. I highly recommend it for everyone ages 12 and over.

Duma has been added and reviewed on my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.",1350518400,,1972,4.4916201117318435

complex relationship with a black native African who at first seems
threatening, but ends up his savior.

2335114,4,B0009XRZS8,"Disclaimer: I am a grown man with no children. Your kids will probably disagree with my criticisms and not care what I think about this movie in the slightest. That is fine.

Duma is a very fun (if extremely unrealistic) family film about a boy in South Africa whose family raises an orphaned cheetah from the time it is a kitten. When the cheetah grows up the boy and his father begin planning to take him to the place where he was born and release him to the wild, but the father suddenly dies before they can begin their journey. The mother decides to move the family to the city where the cheetah predictably gets loose, causes a panic, and nearly gets shot by trigger happy police. The boy, still in his school uniform with no provisions packed, takes the cheetah in his father's motorcycle with sidecar in an attempt to travel the many miles to the cheetah's homeland. The boy and his cheetah travel through the deserts and savannahs of Africa, befriended by a native tribesman on a journey of his own.

This movie is definitely deserving of criticism. The plot is contrived, many of the events don't make sense, the characters never seem to be in any real danger, everything is too linear without enough side plots that should have been fleshed out, and the ending is much too abrupt. But with all of its flaws, Duma is an extremely entertaining movie. It is fun, humorous, adventurous, and genuinely emotionally touching. The kid is a good actor, and his relationship with the cheetah is probably some of the best child/animal chemistry ever to appear in a major motion picture. The star of the film really is Duma the cheetah, and Duma is just a big loveable housecat who does things that cats do. He also makes the cutest little chirping/meowing sounds.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a good family adventure - especially anyone who loves cats. However unless you have children I don't recommend buying this one because it might not be so good on repeat viewings.",1298851200,,2006,4.61344537815126

The film's setting is fantastic. Beautiful deserts, real lions and African wildlife. Duma the Cheetah is a great actor. At times, I thought it was a robotic Cheetah because I couldn't believe a real Cheetah would be such a good actor. But Duma hits it spot on.

There are some odd moments in the film, mostly due to one or two silly plot twists. For example, at one point Xan's traveling companion becomes stuck under a pile of rocks and sand.

2335129,2,B0009XRZS8,"i had high hopes for this movie based on the reviews, but i as well as my family were a bit let down with it.

thankfully we saw it on home box office in HD, because there really are some stunning scenic moments in this movie.  the shots of the cheetah growing up are priceless and any cat owner that watches the movie will find themselves captivated by how similar members of the cat family are of any size.  but when a movie gets this good of reviews yet was never a big success something must be amiss.

i first have to say the audio recording in the movie is poor at best in many scenes.  after getting tired of hearing complaints from everyone that they could not hear the people talking, i finally took a minute and cranked the center channel of my receiver all the way up to be able to understand what anyone was saying, a first of hundreds of movies watched.  yes, they had accents, but it wasn't that.

i did not read the book, but by the sounds of it the book has a better story line than the movie.  i know this movie was geared for kids and adults should try not to get hung up on the details that are not realistic but come on.  not sure where to even start.  the kid almost dies in the desert without food and water yet somehow only a few scenes later is tricking tourists to steal their food in order to stay lost instead of begging them to get him home.  by the way, the scene stealing their food was ridiculous.  just because a snake pops out of his shirt, 20 people with no place to go literally disappear leaving them to have their way with the food?  some other parts dragged making it difficult to keep my kids attention while others like the 'danger' scenes were just cheap scare tactics.

i am a cheerleader for this class of movie and was excited to sit down with the family to watch it but in my opinion it didn't stack up.

my 5 year old did cry at the end if that counts for anything.  actually it was the second to last scene saying goodbye to the cheetah.  i on the otherhand cried at the final scene at such a terrible ending with the boy reuniting with his mother.  really bad...",1186099200,6,2110,4.167901234567902

It opens into a completely new kind of wild world and puts viewers on a somewhat philosophical journey with the themes in this movie. Themes are plentiful and very useful as well as they are mostly non-controversial. They include: Self Discovery, growing up, accepting the loss of a parent, and a great deal about friendships, love and respect.

In the end, the movie leaves a very positive, enchanting feeling and allows lots of reflection. I highly recommend it to older children and adults. It is not too thematic for youngsters, but  younger children will have difficulty grasping the idea of this movie.

This is a great story about life, it deserves a high rating.",1168473600,2,840,4.779310344827586
2335137,4,B0009XRZS8,"There are two levels to this movie. There's the hackneyed plot, obvious to any adult, albeit with some truly wonderful cinematography. You will not get bored watching it with your kid.

Like the famous scene on the motorcycle, with the cheetah running along and the Dad calling out the numbers in astonishment, ending with: ""He's overtaking us!"" Yes, that's actually a cheetah running alongside a motorcycle at 80mph and more.

And then there's the eyes of a 10 year-old like my son, who chilled upon imagining himself in the place of the young boy who, after finding the mewling cub by the road, turns to his dad and says: ""Do you know what those black lines on his face mean? He's a cheetah: the fastest animal in the world!""

To actually be a small child, and own the rare, fer-sure fastest animal on the planet ... but of course, he doesn't. And therein lies the rub. And the plot.

For some reason, one parent always has to die. I don't know why parents have to die in all good children's stories: I think it's most probably at the hands of lazy storytellers. But die they do. This death makes more sense than most, driving the discovery.

You will see the hard times befall, and the incomprehensible (back to the child-eyes again) move to the city, with the cheetah in a high-rise, breaking out to rescue his buddy from school bullies. Total yawn, unless you are (say) ten, in a new school, have no power whatsoever, and would really like a friendly cheetah to show up round about NOW.

And the flight to save the cat, into the deep, deep desert on Dad's old BMW motorbike, with the cheetah in the sidecar looking utterly domesticated and happy with technology. Which he is, for a while.

And then there's an hour of unoriginal wilderness adventures, with the evil, mercenary bad guy showing up. Sure: you can see that he has a good heart, but your kid can't.

And those child eyes don't see a hackneyed adventure. They see astonishing scenes of raw nature, trust broken, betrayal, abandonment (that last done by the kid), and a wild animal that he once thought was his forever.

Sure, he also eventually sees his one surviving parent, but the relationship has permanently changed: the boy is growing up.

2335150,5,B0009XRZS8,"Many years ago Carroll Ballard (little known that time) with already famous in that days Francis Ford Coppola created a stunning visual treat called The Black Stallion. Now more than twenty fives years later this exceptionally talented director (unfortunately I haven't seen his Fly Away Home) brought to us another terrific masterpiece, movie filled with beauty and love.

This time it is a story of Xan, twelve or thirteen years old boy, who lives with his parents on their farm somewhere in the heart of South Africa. Their life is very close to what we can call harmony with outward things and particularly with wild nature. One day Xan with his father accidentally found on a road a helpless cheetah cub and since than Duma (they picked up such a name because Duma on Swahili means cheetah) became a part of the family. Soon bonds of friendship or love (depends on how you would call that) tie the boy and the animal but as wisely said Xan's father they can't breed Duma forever and some day they must set him free. However some unexpected obstacles forced them to move into a big city and after an accident in the school Xan realizes that the time has come and he must do something for his friend. So the adventure begins. I guess some people could find that hardly possible but than our heart tells us sometimes we can do things hardly explainable and the movie shows us that Xan is not a cosset city boy. He must travel through hundred of miles and many tests and finally he grow up during this adventure. Although there is nothing spoiled in Xan's character (there are obviously some similarities with Kelly Reno's Alec from mentioned The Black Stallion) throughout the movie we can see that he is just a more or less ordinary boy who is doing the things he believes in. And that's the most important somehow his innocence and pure heart is able to awake the best in people around him. This character is brought to life by Alex Michaletos, who was terrific playing such interesting and memorable character. This newcomer for hour and a half makes me feel sick about most of overrated today's Hollywood young stars. His performance is full of life and very believable all the time. Eamonn Walker (who plays Ripkuna, a mysterious man whom Xan meets in his journey) is a good and very suitable choice for that character. Among other decent supporting cast it is worth to mention Campbell Scott and Hope Davis as Xan's parents.

The cinematography is excellent all over the movie from subtle shots on the farm to beautiful shots of wild savanna and desert. There is a feeling of harmony and some easy to feel beauty here. However it's quite important that the director always know sense of proportion and the movie never looks like a Discovery or Animal Planet show. One of the main heroes, the beautiful cat is also perfectly shot from different angles. Nice music with lots of thematic African elements excellently supplements all the rest.

Duma is a very beautiful, intelligent and poignant movie about discovering, love, friendship and all positive in human beings. This message of the movie is quite simple. The beauty, love and human kindness still can save our world and this is worth fighting for. Unfortunately these values are not very common to modern Hollywood production. This movie didn't get a wide distribution with reasonable marketing campaign, which it definitely deserved (unfortunately in our commercialized world you hardly can sell anything without good marketing). In my personal opinion Duma is one of the very best motion pictures of the year, and the only second movie that earn my respect and got highest possible grade from me (the other one was Dear Frankie). Congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Warner Bros., Carroll Ballard and all people involved in making this spectacular masterpiece. I'm also so happy that I was able to watch Duma on English, not only a dubbed version (although this time it wasn't really bad).

Thanks for reading.",1159574400,7,3983,4.810218978102189
2335151,4,B0009XRZS8,"Duma is a cheetah and if you are Swahili, you know that duma means cheetah in that language. No matter what your language, this is a movie worth buying and watching.

A young boy and his father are returning home when they come upon a cheetah cub in the roadway. Lost and abandoned, they take the little fellow to their home where it proceeds to grow from a handful to a bed full. It was agreed when the cub was acquired that he would have to return to the wild at some time in the future. The boy's father becomes ill as that time approaches and dies before they can make it happen.

Soon thereafter his mother announces they will have to lease their farm and move to the city. Duma makes the trip as well but the city is no place for the big cat as we are shown in a humorous and sometimes harrowing escapade when he comes visiting the boy's school.

The movie has a few jumps of location thereafter without much, if any, explanation of how it was accomplished, but no matter, just accept it and move on.

The rest of the story is about the trek to get Duma to the area he came from and it is quite a trek indeed.

This is a gem of a story with magnificent photography which the entire family can enjoy and should, preferably together. Whoever was responsible for marketing this film when it was released should be horsewhipped, but you can still buy the DVD for the family for less than it would have cost to take everyone to the movies and you can watch it more than once.

If it's good enough for my pre-teen daughter, and my three other step-daughters, that's pretty good for me!

2335154,5,B0009XRZS8,"My husband was humoring me as I started this DVD, with its orphaned cheetah cub.  Oh no, a cute animal movie, he was no doubt thinking.

Well yes, Little Duma, with his squeaks and kittenish big eyes, is cute, but not in the syrupy Disney way but as a precious, real tiny creature.

The story begins with Duma's mother meeting a bad end from a lion. A young boy and his father rescue the cub.

At the halfway point, the movie swerved into a quest for Duma's home.  The film felt like part Mad Max, with an improvised vehicle veering across the polychrome desert, and part Huckleberry Finn, with a young runaway and an older, savvy guide.  We both (and that includes my husband, Mr. Macho, forced to watch an animal movie) were fascinated as Duma, his young master and an African sidekick make their way across desert, lion-filled savannah and crocodile-infested river.

We both got around to seeing March of the Penguins last week and found Duma to be about 8x more fun, and probably less disturbing for kids, with a mature and satisfying ending to the young boy's sojourn with his wild friend. It certainly deserves to be a hit DVD.  Do see it if you like good scenery and wildlife.

Duma will resonate especially with those who have been on safari.  It reminded me of visiting Kenya in 1999 and watching a pair of what our Swahili-speaking drivers called ""duma"" resting in a clearing.  They were a couple of cool customers, happy to lounge around surrounded by a half-dozen Toyotas with camping tops filled with amateur photographers.

The ""Duma"" of this DVD moves around a lot more than the ones we saw on safari and appears to hit 60 mph in a few scenes. Let's hope for a new release down the road with a good bonus feature on how the filmmaker got one of the big cats to snuggle in bed with a child actor!",1153526400,4,1810,4.468085106382978

2335156,5,B0009XRZS8,"Carroll Ballard's films are such superior family fare that it is a mystery to me why they aren't overwhelming hits in the theatre.  Ballard starts at a level of respect for the intelligence of children and his films never condescend to them and this lack of dumbing-down makes them a pleasure for their parents as well.  And so it is with this wonderful tale of a South African boy who raises an orphaned cheetah and the adventures he has when he must undertake to return him to the wild by himself.

Ballard's films are always beautiful to behold and this one is no exception, with the desert landscapes photographed exquisitely by Werner Maritz.  With brief but solid supporting performances from Campbell Scott and Hope Davis as the boy's parents, the main characters in the film are Alexander Michaeletos as Xan, the boy, and Eamonn Walker as Rip, the drifter he encounters on his journey.  Both are fine.  And of course, the other main performer is Duma, the cheetah, and here Ballard again works his magic with animals creating a natural rapport between the luminous big cat and his human co-stars.

There is tragedy, danger, humor and finally wisdom woven through this story.  Something that might stimulate discussion when the film is done.  This is first-rate film-making by any measure and you should treat yourself to a lively story told with humor and sensitivity and filled with the beauty of rugged landscape and the unbelievable natural beauty of the magnificent animal at its center.",1153267200,2,1499,4.893280632411067

His dad then suggest he return the Cheetah, which he has named Duma, to the wild as had he said they would have to do from the time they first got it. He is apprehensive not only because Duma is his best friend, but his father is ill with cancer.

His mom, Duma, and him have moved to the city and both he and Duma are not doing well. Since the place they found Duma is far from his home he takes his father's motorcycle and heads out without his mothers knowledge. He encounters a native to the land and they both make the journey which teaches them both something of human and animal nature. I liked this movie for a number of reasons.

2335170,4,B0009XRZS8,"I have to admit I watched this family film solely based on Roger Ebert's enthusiastic thumbs-up, and I'm glad I did. It made me immediately recall a film from my childhood, Alexander Mackendrick's 1963 ""A Boy Ten Feet Tall"" about a boy who travels the length of the African continent by himself after his parents are killed. The more obvious inspiration, however, is James Hill's 1966 ""Born Free"" about a lioness that needs to be returned to the wild. The fact that this 2005 film is directed by Carroll Ballard, who made the remarkable 1979 film, ""The Black Stallion"", ensures a level of craftsmanship rare in films these days. Thanks mainly to the sumptuous cinematography by Werner Maritz, this is a panoramic nature film of the highest order.

The plot itself is small as befitting a family film. Based on a true story, it focuses on twelve year-old Xan, who has raised a cheetah named Duma on his family's South African farm since both were cubs. A tragedy forces Xan to take Duma out to the wild, where it belongs, without telling his mother. He makes it on a motorcycle to the middle of the Kalahari Desert where he runs out of gas and meets a suspicious wanderer named Ripkuna. Their adventures together make up the best parts of the film after a too-lengthy set-up in South Africa.  There are impressive scenes highlighting the rapport between Xan and Duma, and Ballard sets up some highly creative action sequences around the motorcycle's conversion into a wind-surfing vehicle, a collapsing mine tunnel, an overwhelming tsetse fly attack and a hair-raising whitewater raft trip amid hungry crocodiles.  It is the realism of these scenes that makes the film resonate more than a standard animal film.

The acting is not the chief attraction here. However, Alexander Michaletos, who was apparently raised on a farm among cheetahs, plays Xan with natural lan, and Eamonn Kelly brings the requisite mystery to Ripkuna. Sporting British accents, indie favorites Campbell Scott and Hope Davis have little more than cameos as Xan's parents. The 2006 DVD is light on extras - no commentary or making-of featurette (which could have been fascinating in this case); just the trailer and a couple of extended scenes are included. Still, this is a fine film to appreciate Ballard's too-rarely-seen cinematic artistry in conveying the delicate balance between humans and animals.",1149552000,2,2377,4.979848866498741

There are a lot of these movies: sometimes the boy is a girl, and the animal can be just about anything you want from a traditional pet like a dog or just about any wild or exotic animal that you can name.  You can also make the location any place on Earth.  With ""Duma"" we have a story about a young boy whose has made a cheetah his pet, with the setting being South Africa (the northern part in fact).  Actually, the location matters more than the animal in this 2005 film, because the boy and the cheetah are joined for most of their journey by somebody else who becomes a key part of their grand adventure.

After the death of its mother, a cheetah cub is found by young Xan (Alex Michaletos) and his father (Campbell Scott).  They live on a farm in South Africa and Xan raises the cub, who is eventually named Duma (much is made of finding the right name and the responsibility that comes from such an act).  Xan understands that the day will come when Duma will have to return to the wild, but circumstances force their separation much earlier than the boy anticipated.  Seeing the only alternative as being the death of Duma, Xan takes his father's motorcycle with its sidecar to get Duma back to the Kalahari Desert.  Of course, the journey will not be easy.  The immediate bad news is that the motorcycle runs out of case.  The good news is that Xan and Duma encounter Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker), who is wandering in the desert trying to find his way home to his own family.  Consequently, there are interpersonal dynamics at work between the trio that add depth to the story of Xan trying to get Duma back to his home in the wild.

The film is based upon the autobiographical novel ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft and his mother Carol Cawthra Hopcraft, although I do not know enough to comment on how ""true"" what we see on the screen might be.  After all, there is a limited amount of direction that I would think you can give to a cheetah (or four different cheetahs as is the case in this film), and it is serendipity to get footage of one chasing after a gazelle.  I certainly wish there had been more opportunities to see the cheetah do its thing.  But there are only a couple of times that Duma gets to fun flat out at full speech (they can do 64 miles per hour for up to five hundred yards), and they are some of the most memorable sequences in the film.  The problem is that when Duma gets up to full speed, he leaves Xan far behind, and that would ruin the story.  The key relationship is obviously between Xan and Duma, but once they meet up the most significant interaction comes between Xan and Ripkuna.  For younger children who can watch such scenes and dream of having such adventures themselves ""Duma"" will be much more entertaining than for those of us who keeping thinking having a cheetah as a pet is a dangerous idea.",1148256000,3,3045,4.338624338624339
2335179,5,B0009XRZS8,"Alex Michaeletos, a South African, was selected over many other boys as Xan, despite casting calls around the world, because he had a pet cheetah himself, and went up to the animal he would be co-starring with and introduced himself by ruffling the cheetah's fur.  Most potential Xans were too scared of the beast to approach it. It is this comfort level between Alex/Xan and Duma that makes the film believable, and Alex's slight Afrikaans accent just heightens the realism. (Like Xan, Alex was raised on a South African farm surrounded by lions, leopards, wild dogs and antelope.)

The fictional plot is a bit contrived, but the film takes you in unexpectedly interesting directions through amazing landscapes.  Carroll Ballard directed Never Cry Wolf as well as Fly Away Home and deserved better exposure with the promotion of Duma, the test-marketing of which in the U.S. Southwest was not very successful. Warner should have released the film in more places than Chicago and New York. It really deserved national release.

There is nothing about the film to date it.  I expect Duma to be enjoyed by families for many years to come.",1147824000,59,1136,4.9267015706806285

8069849,5,B0009XRZS8,"Duma is on my personal list of favorite movies, I love it! It's also my favorite Carroll Ballard film. I love The Black Stallion too but love this one a little more. Duma is one cool cat! Love to watch him run. Perfectly clean film with nothing inappropriate (just an off screen death and the sadness associated with that). I liked the friendship that develops between Xan and Rip. This film has a charm about it that I love; like the scene toward the end of their journey together where Rip rests his hat on Duma's head resulting in them both cracking up laughing! The scene with Duma running alongside the motorcycle is also done beautifully. My daughter loved this film and most likely, so will your kids.",1513555200,,708,4.5390625
