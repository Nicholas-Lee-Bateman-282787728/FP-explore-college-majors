7663972,3,B01BLX0UFY,"Some say it was only a matter of time before mockbuster studio Asylum took aim at the CG medium in trying to capitalize on audiences who often mistake their movies for the real thing.  Perhaps youve heard of Transmorphers, Snakes on a Train or The Day the Earth Stopped?  Yup, all these guys.

The thing with CG is it is incredibly costly and time consuming to produce.  So studios without massive, massive budgets (to provide some insight, the average cost to make the good CG films you see up at your local theater is around $200-million) typically have only one option for releasing a CG film:  They buy the rights to a foreign-produced CG movie thats already run its course, they bring in some actors to record an English vocal track and they release it as something all their own.

Does this technique work? Rarely!  But its quite common, especially in the direct-to-DVD scene, the kiosks of the Redbox and through streaming services like Netflix.  One would assume this would be what The Asylum would have done as well but the company insists it wanted to do things the old fashioned way..  I think its a very natural progression, says David Rimawi, CEO and co-founder of The Asylum. Our in-house VFX department is used to creating many, many sharks and robots for our live-action films, so animating creatures for a film like this just makes sense.

Enter Izzie's Way Home; a 2016 American direct-to-video computer-animated comedy adventure film produced by The Asylum.  It represents The Asylum's first animated feature, and is considered to be a mockbuster of the 2016 Pixar Animation Studios film Finding Dory even though it came out one month to the day prior to Finding Dory.

Asylum assembled a serviceable vocal cast including the likes of Tori Spelling, Zack Ward and Joey Fatone.

The story tells of an aquarium community of fish, the likes of which can make Mean Girls seem like a group of well-adjusted girl scouts, who get dumped from their yacht home directly into the open ocean.  From there its a mission of dad and daughter reuniting from opposite sides of an underwater volcano (why they simply don't swim the long way around is never made clear).

Along the way we encounter all sorts of weird and wacky oceanic inhabitants; an octopus known as Jimmy Eight-Legs, an anorexic seahorse, a burping sea cucumber that poops out his intestines in the face of danger (three times across the 74-minute run-time no less).  Hey, nobody ever accused The Asylum of being discreet.

The films plotting is surprising decent with the exception of a few scenes that tend to meander a bit.  Honestly, for a first time effort, the finished product isn't near the train wreck one would expect.  Obviously, it gives Pixar absolutely no viable competition whatsoever though it does have its share of decent moments (Fatone, in particular rises to the challenge of breathing some life into the role of said sea cucumber).

Visually, the film is a very mixed bag.  Occasionally textures and backgrounds are quite well-done but more often than not, things look flat and lifeless.  The character facial rigs in particular come off as odd and robotic, with mouth flaps often falling out of sync or characters speaking without any mouth movements at all.  This is more noticeable in some scenes than it is in others but its clear that a bit more polish would have been useful throughout.

In conclusion, its easy to bag on the film.  After all, we live in a society who has been spoiled by the likes of Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks with our CG animated films for years but all factors considering, The Asylum didn't botch this one up nearly as bad as it could have.  In fact, an argument could be made with a little more finesse and ironing out of the proverbial rough spots, perhaps they could transition themselves into a legitimate producer of CG animated feature film.  Somehow I doubt they're willing to let go of opportunities like Angry Bears, 51 Shades of Grey, or Independents Day.",1487030400,,3988,4.792397660818714

7664140,5,B01BLX0UFY,My 4 year old granddaughter and I watched this movie together and we loved it. It has such a wonderful plot and keeps your attention.  When the movie ended she asked could she watch it again and so we watched it twice.  It is so cute as all the fish are beautiful colors as salt water fish are and they all talk. There are no humans in the movie.  Normally she colors while movies are on the smart tv but she quit coloring and got up on the sofa with her favorite blanket and watched the entire movie. She had me pause it for her to get something to drink. I hope to see more of movies such as this one for children. I normally do not watch movies like this but it was so cute I had to watch and am glad I did.,1476144000,,710,3.882758620689655

I've never written such a harsh, negative review of any film or product but this movie was truly terrible.  I strongly suspect the positive reviews were paid for by someone because there's no other explanation as far as I can tell.  I was especially bothered by the sea cucumber character bragging that he can shoot his intestines out of his butt (as worded in the film).  If they were trying to be ""educational"" about sea creatures it could have been approached with at least an ounce of tact.

While it is difficult to find a redeemable quality one must commend Camillie Licate for finding so many people to write reviews about how she is a  great writer. This movie is pretty much unwatchable but what do you expect from ""Asylum"" productions. . . Insanity. I saw better graphics in the 1994 Sega CD game Wily Beamish than this movie. Tori Spelling and Joey Fatone have both had difficult careers in recent year and this movie is proof that we need to start a charity to support them now that they are both unable to make good decisions.

My three year old would have probably loved this, if it was the first cartoon he ever watched, unfortunately that was not the case.  He asked me to turn it off because it was boring.  He wanted me to put on ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Finding Dorry"".  He even likes ""The Reef"" more, ""The Reef"", and that's not even that great.

My wife and I could not believe the dialog in ""Izzie's Way Home"".  There were long awkward pauses between dialog, and a lot of scenes where the fish were just sitting around not doing anything except looking at eachother.  The story line, on-the-other-hand, was all too familiar.

The lost fish trying to find it's way home, meeting friends who end up helping out along the way, and even deciding to stay as a memeber of the society in which our fishy star is destined to find.  Pixar and Disney already did this, and this movie was terrible at trying to cover it in it's own style, or lack thereof.

I always think that it's a type of poetic justus when a blockbuster hit is released and, shortly after, another director/producer attempts to do the same thing, and it flops.  Why don't we concentrate on new ideas, rather than reinventing the wheel?",1516320000,4,1280,4.517391304347826
