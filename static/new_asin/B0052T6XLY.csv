4531344,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn is THE authority on Krav Maga in the USA. He is on the board of the Israeli Krav Maga Association (The First and only legitimate Krav Maga Association founded by the founder of Krav Maga Imi lichtenfeld). This is the real and only legitimate source on true Krav Maga in DVD. If you are looking for not only the REAL Krav Maga but also the best, look no further. David Kahn is the best and his instruction is simple and anyone can learn it. I had a chance to speak with Mr. Kahn and in all my years of training in the martial arts I have never encountered a teacher with the passion and humility that Mr. Kahn has. There are many fakes and liars out there trying to pose as real krav but David Kahn under Grandmaster Haim Gidon and the IKMA is the only and true Krav Maga Authority in the US that has published in DVD. If you would like to know the history of Krav Maga and who is fake/dishonest just do a search online for fake Krav Maga instructors. You can look elsewhere for Krav Maga Instruction... but i would not recommend it.",1308614400,2,1043,4.22
4531345,5,B0052T6XLY,"Excellent, no hype, no filler material. Just very good instruction. Actually David's products are the BEST I have seen.

Being able to watch & re watch is a big advantage & these products are well worth the money.

4531347,5,B0052T6XLY,"I am a big fan of all of David Kahn's material, and I picked up his DVDs to supplement his written material. Like his books, the technique here is clearly articulated, focused on details, and effective. This DVD serves as a great introduction to reality-based martial arts/self defense. Even as a person who has been training Krav Maga for some time, I learned much from this set. I went on to purchase the additional DVDs in the set, which is a great compliment. But the best compliment I can give is a wholehearted recommendation, here and in real life: I give this DVD to my friends who are interested in starting self-defense training and tell them that there are few primers better than the work of David Kahn.",1509753600,,715,4.59375
4531348,5,B0052T6XLY,Anyone interesting in steping up their Krava Maga skills to the next level needs to get this DVD.

I explained that I really enjoy the series, but one of my DVDs cracked.  I asked if I could purchase a replacement DVD.  Mr. Kahn volunteered to mail me a new set of DVDs free of charge.  A great product with excellent customer service.",1499817600,,354,4.453125

4531353,5,B0052T6XLY,"First of all, I will not appear as a Verified Purchaser, as my wife has the Prime Account.  I became interested in learning Krav Maga several months ago.  I did my due diligence on researching a good instructor and a proven system.  David Kahn's name and affiliates came up time and time again.  I purchased Vol 1.  I first watched the videos, then began practicing the teachings at home.  David is a first class instructor, and teaches the original Krav.  Perhaps nothing wrong with others, but I wanted to learn the original system.  After about two weeks of practicing with Vol 1, I bought Vol's 2,3, & 4.  They have all exceeded my expectations in what I wanted and needed to learn.  I've also added three of his books to my library.  Again, very worthwhile purchases, as they reinforce what I see in the DVD's.  My desire to learn Krav comes from being a Trooper with the PA State Police for nearly 15 years.  If you are in LE, or a civilian wanting to have the ability to protect yourself, and are looking for a great system, look no further than David's teaching material.  Being in LE this long, of course I'm skeptical of most everything I see.  My only regret is that I didn't do this several years ago.  I'll never be done learning from him and his products, and can't wait to move through the other volumes.  Of course, I've sneaked a peak at them to what is coming, and can say my reviews of them will rate them just as highly as this first set.  Thank you to David for making this available, most importantly as a great training, not a ""movie"" of look what I can do!  Too bad I can only go ""5 stars"".",1496880000,,1614,4.337792642140468
4531354,5,B0052T6XLY,"In Volume #1, David presents the basics to get you started on your journey in Krav Maga.  I highly recommended all his books, DVDs and if you have the opportunity to train with him in person, do it.  My 25 year journey in the martial arts have given me many opportunities to train with some of the best instructors in the world.  David Kahn is at the top of the my list of great teachers.  I am sure you will love this DVD series.",1496620800,,430,4.083333333333333
4531363,5,B0052T6XLY,"Amazing DVDs. I started Krav Maga a few months ago and we are lucky enough to have a good teacher, black belt level 2, he went several times to Israel to perfeccionate his skills.
My teacher told me David Kahn was really good so I bought the DVDs and I'm delighted with it. The course is very complete and covers everything, filming and sound are good and David speaks a clear english so everything is easy to understand and well explained.
All in one a wonderful tool to learn Krav Maga, I highly recommend this DVD set.
Also, David did send me an email to offer help in case I had any doubt about the techniques, he seems to be a very down to earth and caring person.",1496275200,,669,4.234375

4531367,5,B0052T6XLY,I really like it! Awesome DVD. Shows the footwork which is what I find to be important and shows little things you cannot pick up from a book. Well worth the money!!,1487894400,2,165,4.1875
4531368,5,B0052T6XLY,David Kahn's way of showing and explaining the techniques is very clear. He shows each technique from the different angles to make it easier to follow. I'm very happy with this buy. Will be watching these DVDs in addition to my in-class training. Very helpful for those who are serious about getting good at Krav Maga.,1486598400,3,318,4.696428571428571
4531369,4,B0052T6XLY,I'm an older guy with some shoulder problems.  I have a history in martial arts.  This takes a lot of the flash out of many training videos and focuses on what you want to know.  The movements are  possible for someone who is not extreamly flexible and feel comfortable performing.  Over all a good self-defense course.,1485561600,2,319,4.625
4531370,5,B0052T6XLY,Got this for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loves it. He has studied different martial arts for many years. He likes the simplicity of this style while still being extremely effective. This volume is very clear and easy to understand.,1482105600,2,243,4.951219512195122
4531371,5,B0052T6XLY,These dvds are GREAT. I get just as much by watching these as I do out of going to class. I really like how he goes over everything several times and even in slow motion. It helps me really get down the fundamentals and I feel gives me an advantage over other people I practice with. Even if you've never done Krav Maga before these dvds are a great place to start!,1479772800,2,365,4.083333333333333

4531379,5,B0052T6XLY,"I purchased the first two volumes of Mastering Krav Maga from Amazon, so far I am still going through volume 1 and I have to say it is awesome.  Master Kahn presents the material in a very thorough and easy-to-follow way, I feel I am really internalizing the material.  Of course its always best to study from a trained expert in person, but there not being one where I am, this is an excellent option.  I'd highly recommend this and volume II which I have skimmed through to anyone looking to learn KM or add to their existing skill set.",1468713600,2,538,4.36

4531388,5,B0052T6XLY,"Informative and traditional when introduced on what krav maga is. Directly to the point for those who like learning fast by observation. Broken down into steps on each DVD so you can recite on your punching bag, training buddy, or by motion in general. Providing options and not subjecting defense to one single motion or combination can be found throughout the set. Easy to learn, quickly adaptive, and effective in need. Get stance work down and the rest is human nature. Defending against multiple attackers is my favorite one. If you're going into the services and/or joining law enforcement pay attention to the weapon defense scenarios (some are hidden as bonus footages). Good luck as Chief Instructor Kahn says on the instructions ""It's Your Krav Maga.""",1455840000,,761,5.0476190476190474

4531390,4,B0052T6XLY,"Instructor is very skilled and demonstrates techniques very well, however this is NOT a ""home study"" type of course.

4531391,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn is one of those rare individuals that can effectively transfer practice to print however, as a Krav practitioner entering my fourth year I've found his videos to be the equivalent of having him in the gym and on the mats. I purchased his Mastering videos for reference purposes and immediately realized his powerful fluid technique  will add another dimension to my rather rudimentary skills. As any fighting system practitioner will admit, to continue drilling down into the learning/practice process one eventually reaches saturation and must then locate another source, a better qualified coach with a fresh perspective, improved technique and more effective delivery. This is what Kahn represents and provides in his videos - truly an accomplished practitioner and effective instructor for anyone interested in learning Krav or adding another layer to their continuing education.",1454716800,2,894,5.525547445255475

4531394,5,B0052T6XLY,"As a practicing Martial Artist, with over twenty years experience in Okinawan Karate,  I purchased David Kahn's books and DVD's to enhance my skill set and further equip me as I took on a new role, this winter,  teaching children  and teens the basics of self defense.  While I've had some exposure to Krav Maga,, I can say without hesitation or qualification, THIS MAN IS A MASTER and his materials (whether in written or DVD format) are second to none.  If you are reading this review, uncertain as to whether or not you should buy his discs or books,  I cannot urge you strongly enough in the ""yes"" direction. You will not regret it and as you watch (or read) you'll be impressed, not only by his skill set, but by his warrior spirit.  He is an emblem and inspiration toward excellence in the martial arts.  Beyond that,  his credibility has been certified by the simple fact that the US Military and countless police departments secure his services to train those who serve and protect the public confirming the fact that he is certainly qualified to teach the rest of us as we also seek to perfect self defense or fighting skills.  Finally,  have had the privilege of speaking directly with him, I will throw in one more affirmation of David Kahn, namely,  his very apparent disposition as a man of honor, genuinely striving to serve and inspire others toward self empowerment and personal growth.  If you're in the market for martial arts/self defense materials, look no further.  You will not be disappointed!  -Dr. Robb Palmer,  Seibukan Shoryin Ru Karate",1454025600,6,1563,4.733333333333333

just went trough the first dvd in the set. I had some training in tae kwon do and other ""flashy"" styles, which I thought was pretty much bs, unless you were planing on doing tournaments or movies. this is real defense. the few practical things I did learn in my previous training were reinforced by this dvd. my girl took a couple self dense classes and agreed. this looks like the real deal. can't wait to go through the rest of the dvds in this set.

I ordered this months ago and have finally gotten around to watching DVD 1 and reading the first book. I've since ordered the other DVD's and David Kahn was nice enough to send me an e-book, not to mention free training at one of his dojo's when in the area.

With this goal in mind, I sought the very best training materials available.  After considerable research, I purchased each of David Kahns three books and three DVDs.  My expectations were exceeded!  Each of these products is an excellent resource.  The books are well-organized and the text is clear and concise.  Simple diagrams and photos are plentiful and serve to reinforce the concepts introduced in the text.  Solo drills are included for those occasions when a training partner is not available.  The DVDs are excellent tools as well.  Each is fast-paced and loaded with valuable information communicated in a straightforward, easy-to-learn manner.  I am inspired to train harder after viewing.  These books and DVDs are set the standard in krav maga instruction.  They are excellent in their own right, but taken together are the next best thing to training with Mr. Kahn himself!",1427846400,3,1001,5.067484662576687
4531417,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn is the real deal. Whether you're new to krav maga or an expert, there is much to learn from David. IMHO krav is an amazing practice. Un-like a martial art that is designed for competition, krav maga is designed for self-defense in the real world.

David is a wonderful teacher. In both his videos and books, David is very clear, his explanations and demonstrations make it easy to understand and learn each move at home.

His deep krav knowledge is evident immediately. His love of the practice and desire to share his knowledge come across in his coaching style. David is very matter of fact. These are not motivational work out tapes. He is not a cheerleader. Just like the defense system he is teaching, david is direct, practical, and highly effective.

These DVDs and David's book Krav Maga: An Essential Guide (http://www.amazon.com/Krav-Maga-Essential-Method---Self-Defense-ebook/dp/B003G93ZLI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427374365&sr=1-1&keywords=krav+maga+david+kahn) have been the perfect complement to my in-person training.

These DVDs help to reinforce the proper techniques, form and approaches learned during in-person training. And David's products have helped me stay ahead of my in-person training.  If you live somewhere that does not have a good krav maga  school to train at, these DVDs would make a great alternative to in-person training if that is your only option. Also, it's important to note, many krav moves & techniques are hard to train without a partner.

 As a few others have mentioned i was also lucky enough to receive an email from David after my purchase. I was blown away that he'd personally reach out. Never mind take an interest in my training. He's given me some great additional coaching over email. Based on the quality of his products, i am planning to train with David at his academy next time i'm in the NJ/NY area.

As corny as it may sound, i'm grateful to David for taking the time and doing the hard work to produce his books and videos. he's helped me progress much faster than i would have without him.

THANK YOU DAVID.",1427328000,7,2088,5.114705882352941
4531418,5,B0052T6XLY,"This is an extremely good series. I've been a kravist for two years, practicing four times a week and I've learned a lot from my instructor, other students and visiting practitioners who have taught me along the way. This series has helped me hone things I already knew, provided new insights into techniques and allowed me to pick up other techniques not taught in my school's curriculum. David's style of explaining things is straight-forward (seems to be a common trait among us kravists!) and easy to follow. It's nice to see instructors making supplements like this for their students and even nicer to see them making this material available so others can learn.

Having stated that, I must say that I have trained in a few traditional and nontraditional martial arts (Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan, Tae Kwon Do, Northern Five animals Kung Fu, Southern Eagle Claw Kung Fu & Muay Thai) for a total of 20 + years and learned the soft core knowledge and hard core as well (I.e basic-intermediate Dim Mak). Currently I am almost 39. I don't want to extend myself too much but I must say that after just having a quick look to some of the chapters (and believe me... I CAN do this with a DEADLY accurate eye... literally...), I got convinced that for someone that has never practiced any kind of martial arts and that also isn't too much interested in spending months and even years of patience and lots of money to perfect effective but right to business defensive - offensive techniques, this series SHOULD BE the core material for developing a solid foundation of what a ""Real World"" defensive system you would use if an ""Unexpected and Potentially Dangerous Event"" should ever happen.
Several years ago (Three to be exact) I received a series of injuries in tournaments (As in three broken fingers of the hands, a disjointed right shoulder, a disjointed right toe, a lower back muscle spasm because of an illegal heel kick thrown at me after I kneeled after receiving a kick in my head and a bent right elbow because of a Chin-Na technique in a Sanda-Sanshou fight) and now that I am fully recovered I was looking for a more down to earth street defensive system, a more of a modern knowledge to blend with what I already know (Centuries old by the way). That's why I decided to give Krav Maga an opportunity to convince me.

I must be honest that in order for an average person with NO MARTIAL TRAINING, this series is a challenge, BUT don't get me wrong, developing an effective and integrated defensive system is never going to be as easy as swallowing the blue or red pill as in some movies (Actually Keanu Revees trained Kung Fu very hard for more than four months in order to achieve the basic - intermediate level of expertise for Matrix movies.)

For those of you out there that has never, or don't want to, practice traditional martial arts and are still looking for a SUPERB and COMPLETE way to be able to defend yourself and to get physically ready to achieve it, look no more, this is all what you are going to ever need (Just remember, the main lesson of ALL defensive systems is always to be AWARE of your surroundings at ALL times in order to anticipate dangerous situations that may arise in order to try to avoid them and if there is not other choice, to defend yourself but with the advantage of not been taken completely off-guard.). By the Way, I buyed Volumes I - III. When I check the remaining two volumes I will post my reviews and for those I will be more specific in my descriptions and impressions because they deal with weapons defenses.
Conclusion: If I would have never ever practiced any of the arts that I have and all that I knew about personal defense were what you can see in the movies, I would be thankful that someone out there with knowledge and hands on experience pointed me in the right direction, well this is what it is all about.",1426032000,14,3360,4.426494345718901

I would suggest that you start with the foot work section then go back to the beginning. most of the power in this form seems to come from the hips and if you don't get your feet set correctly its a little difficult to get that to begin with.  other then that only thing that I didn't like is that you are held to a slightly watered down ""civilian"" version.",1425513600,3,452,4.067415730337078

While this isn't a ""blue print"" to black belt, Krav Maga isn't really supposed to be such a thing in the first place. Persons wishing to buy a belt in a box type training program will be disappointed.

Mr. Kahn has taken the time to line out the main system concepts as well as display the proper way they should be utilized. Combative instruction should be simple, easy to learn, and effective. David has presented this material in a way that does exactly that.

I have been training in martial arts for 34 years, I am a military and law enforcement veteran (certified LE Instructor), and I currently own/operate a martial arts/defensive tactics training facility. My personal opinion is that this is one of the best DT DVD sets available to the general public and at a very fair price.

It's an all inclusive system that all you need to do is pay attention and find a good practice partner.

David makes himself very accessible, and strives to make sure you are happy with the product that he has provided.  How can you go wrong, a lot of this information is what he taught to the USMC to incorporate into the Martial Arts Program?!",1416268800,3,585,4.83
4531435,5,B0052T6XLY,"Mr. Kahn is an excellent DVD instructor. Anticipates questions one might have very well and really emphasizes the flow and movement.  Years ago I viewed the D. Levine series which were good, helpful from near zero knowledge but broke steps into such small bits that it did not flow. I was glad to have that pedantic instruction.  This is different. Mr. Kahn is articulate but teaches much more by showing than talking about it.  The material is densely packed and one has to really focus to keep up.  Yes, it would have been nice to have more slow motion details and perhaps step by step moves (disarming for example), but I think these little details can be obtained from books, etc.  Mr. Kahn really establishes the principal of continuous action well.  I received emails from David Kahn offering explanation regarding the DVD should any questions arise after purchase which I thought was big and above average.

4531438,3,B0052T6XLY,I felt like the techniques were solid but my biggest issue that I didn't like is that there are no slow motion explanations for any of them and a breakdown of how they work! I currently train in Krav Maga and have a great personal instructor so I'm not totally helpless in breaking the techniques down and figuring them out but I defintely feel it would have been more helpful with at least one slow motion attack per technique with explanations throughout each attack on how it works! As a whole it's good stuff but I don't think you could just pick this up alone and effectively learn Krav Maga! You'd want to still get personal training it it for a better understanding of Krav Maga as a whole.,1413590400,8,697,4.410852713178294

I have limited range of motion at the older age of 63. Bad knee. Not a lot of air. Etc. I am not doing any rolling or tumbling. This video takes the essence of attacking the attacker to a completely simple and direct prose. It is done with clarity in execution and target definition. It does not indulge itself for any sake other than you getting out alive. No excess verbiage or hyperbole and past personal stories. But not at all tedious or dry. It's the first time I purchased anything on Amazon and had the seller write to thank me, and offer his phone number with an offer to please call him if I need further help!  And for the number of videos and the extent of Krav Maga taught, and the very good camera shots and angles and clearly repeated just enough to not be overly redundant and, and the set is affordably priced!

David Kahn's material definitely ranks among the best.  He is able to not only convey direct and effective combative concepts, but more importantly the mindset that accompany them.  No matter your level of skill and/or training, these DVDs and the companion books are a vital resource to your training library.  Be forewarned though, this material is NOT for belt seekers or those more inclined towards combative sports.  This is true krav maga.  If you wish to improve or develop unarmed skills that will serve you well in any environment, look no further.

4531447,5,B0052T6XLY,"A fantastic source for learning Krav Maga. The DVDs (all three volumes: bare hands combat, edge weapon and firearms) consist well structured materials from upper body to lower body movements and divided chapter-by-chapter. The DVDs also include various scenarios where some techniques would be more effective than others and teach you when to best apply them.

The only precaution that you must take when learning using this video, is to first prepare yourself with some basic Krav Maga training beforehand, and preferably work through the movements with an experienced instructor. Otherwise, you risk injuring yourself or your training partner in the process, as this is clearly not a martial art meant for sport but serious self-defense. Prior training also helps you understand the mechanics of human body, including joint movements and manipulations, switching centre of gravity, balance, speed and power.

4531452,5,B0052T6XLY,"The Mastering Krav Maga series are the only on the market that hold to what the founders intentions were. Simple, effective, but not without attention to detail and it's these details that are explained in a no nonsense way through out the series. I basically own every Krav product there is for the simple reason of not having qualified instruction in my region, so I have to be careful of what I'm buying into. I began with Mr. Kahn's books years ago and noticed right away the level of expertise and passion for Krav in his writing which more than carries over and can be witnessed in the dvd series. Know that this first series doesn't address weapons defenses which may surprise some because we've all seen the disarms repeatedly on every media. This series follows the IKMA curriculum which teaches weapons defenses once personal combatives are mastered and the student shows proficiency in those combatives. Edged weapons and firearms are covered in great detail in series II and III showing the depth of the system. I'm left with the impression that Mr. Kahn's concern through the lessons is that of bringing quality to the student and of being sure the student is aware of how important it is to understand the level of readiness, willingness and preparation through proper training to actually implement the material.

The demonstrated techniques are done with the serious intent this subject deserves without becoming a mystical journey that distances the veiwer from the teacher. It's not pretty; because it's not supposed to be. If you've been hypnotised into thinking you have be a mma adonis to protect yourself, this set is not for you. The fact is more than 90% of the North American population has never done any martial art or self defense, these are the people that need it most.

4531473,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga (Volume 1) is one of the best instructional dvd's on Krav Maga that I have seen to date. I have purchased other well known instructors material and they are not even close to the in depth teaching of David Kahn. I have been doing martial arts since the early 90's and most instructional dvd's start off with rolls,falls,grabs,kicks,or a combination. David breaks down all of your striking in phases from close,medium,to long range,then how to counter with the same strikes. You understand why you learn the move instead of just learning something and not knowing when or where it will come into play. From here he builds the foundation of what you will learn in Krav Maga. This is exactly what is missing in most schools and instructional videos. I highly endorse these,not only do you get great instruction but he contacts you personally after you purchase to tell you thank you and he is there for you if you have any questions. Will be buying volume 2 for sure.

********11/23/13 Update*********
You will never ever disappointed with David Kahn.

I know, this is a product review, and I have said that in my original review, clear and detail demonstration, with explanations. As for what techniques are in there? Life saving techniques, that's all I can say, you got to get the DVDs to see them all. It won't go well with wordings here. And isn't getting it from the right personal as important as the product itself? Here goes with my experience of buying from Mr. Kahn.

I got a thank you email from Mr. Kahn. I was happy to received that especially he said if I have any questions with the techniques, or any Krav Mage related questions, he would be happy to answer them, and that I can train with him as his guess if I would be in NY. Who doesn't like that? especially when you are new to Krav Maga. At first, I thought it was a computer generated email especially I got it a short time after my purchase. For this, I have to apologize to Mr. Kahn, I have never gotten any emails from buyer before. I didn't know he would really take the time to write it.

Then after about 2 weeks, I thought I should give the DVDs a review. and you can see my original review on the top, with a 4 star. My review was positive, with a recommendation at the end. What surprised me was that Mr. Kahn also took the time to read it, and emailed me again, and give me more information on going deeper into Krav Maga techniques. It really made my day. I text my friend saying ""I am feeling spoiled"" lol. I don't feel like a customer of his, I feel like dealing with a friend.

If you are like me, value customer service as much as the product itself. Get your Krav Maga from David Kahn. Enjoy your practice. :)",1384819200,,2388,4.286031042128603
4531479,5,B0052T6XLY,"As a police officer in the central Texas area, I was looking for a self-defense/fitness training system that would help me take my combative and defensive skills to the next level.  Immediately, I found myself swimming in a sea of choices.  I thought to myself, with a plethora of combative and self-defense systems, how do I find the right one?  I finally came across the word Krav Maga which presented its own challenges of narrowing down choices. After tirelessly searching the net for Krav Maga material, I think I found the real deal; David Kahn's 6 - disc DVD set ""Mastering Krav Maga"" Vol 1, as well as his books ""Krav Maga 2004 "" and ""Advanced Krav Maga 2008 "" The reason why I say this is because in order to really understand something, one must understand its origin.  After reading and watching David's materials, I think he does just that.  In his first book, ""Krav Maga"", David introduces you to the founder and architect of Krav Maga, Imi Lichtenfeld. David then goes on to share the philosophy of Krav Maga, as well as a comprehensive comparison to other self-defense systems. By understanding the historical backdrop and circumstances that motivated Imi to develop Krav Maga, I had a deeper appreciation of its real-world use and effectiveness.

After reading David's books, I then began watching the Mastering Krav Maga DVD series.  Although I was able to grasp the many concepts and techniques described by David's books, the DVDs brought those concepts and techniques to life.  First off, I would have to say the DVDs were well produced and directed, which was evident in the overall production quality.  With regards to production content, David presented himself in a professional and very knowledgeable manner.  My overall impression was that I was not just watching a promotional how-to video, but rather I was participating in a real-life Krav Maga class.  The training material presented in the DVDs was truly designed to cater to all self-defense skill levels. Whether you are a beginner or advanced practitioner of Krav Maga these DVDs are for you.  David's progressive teaching style in the DVDs reflects Krav Maga's philosophy of ""building block learning process.""  Having background in karate and law enforcement combative training, I appreciated the fact that certain concepts and techniques were stressed, and not just glossed over with repetitive demonstrations.  That in my opinion is something to take note of because the impression I walked away with was this is not just some guy making a video to sell, but an instructor that has a real desire of wanting to see people truly master Krav Maga.

I decided to purchase Krav Maga Vol 2 Impact and Edge weapons. If you are serious about learning ""true"" Krav Maga I highly recommend you invest in these training materials.'",1383350400,,2806,4.953091684434968
4531480,5,B0052T6XLY,I thought this was a five star product because the moves are broken down and done in slow motion so you can actually see what the instructor is doing and how he is doing it. I would recommend it to everyone. Especially people who walk to their car at night.,1382832000,,257,4.16
4531481,5,B0052T6XLY,"Before getting too deep - people need to understand that the DVD by itself will never be a perfect replacement for in-life tuition from an accomplished professional.

Having said that, I would still take a DVD and remote learning than average instructions. The DVD's do exactly what I expected - they deliver great insight and tips from a Master that is right on the top tier by all accounts in the public domain.
It is true, as other reviewers said, that this is done at a very fast pace, when considering how much time one would need to train to go from a beginner to intermediate. But from my personal standpoint, I understood that and I always take my time with watching and learning - it requires a lot replaying and paying attention to detail to assimilate the information but never the less, I feel that the value from lessons learnt far exceeds the invested time. I also regularly go back to viewing the materials - an advantage that in-life tuition obviously does not offer.
All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone considering learning Krav Maga - even if you combine it with courses at your local Krav Maga practitioner, this is an invaluable aid.",1382313600,,1169,4.6201923076923075
4531482,5,B0052T6XLY,"First off, let me say that this is not a necessarily a review of ""Krav Maga"" in general. People have differing opinions about the system and to each his own. This review is about his materials and David Khan specifically.

I cannot recommend this DVD set enough. David is as top notch a teacher as I have ever seen. His style is down to earth. He is extremely knowledgeable and he keeps it real. He does a wonderful job of explaining exactly what you will be doing; he leaves little for you to have to try and figure out on your own. You will not find a whole lot to complain about here. Sure, the pictures are illustrations, not photos. Big deal. A punch is a punch and a kick is a kick. It ain't rocket science and David is not really teaching anything new here. But that is the beauty of his ""system""; it's instinctual. For example, when someone tries to choke you, your first reaction is is reach up and grab the attacker's hands (the plucking technique). Or, when someone is swinging a wild haymaker at the side of your head, your first instinct may be to either throw your arm up to block (360 defense) or lean back away from it (upper body retreat). For the most part, you're doing this stuff already and probably don't even know it. All David and his predecessors have done is give names to everything so when he says, ""Today we're working on X,"" everyone will know what X is and be on the same page training-wise.

To be fair, and so that you see that I am not a Khan mark, I do have a few reservations. The biggest problem I have with Krav Maga -- David's system included -- as well as any other martial art, is that specific defenses simply do not work in a real street fight. What is a ""specific"" defense, you ask? This is where you learn one technique for a wrist grab, another for an elbow grab, another for a shoulder grab, another for a lapel grab, another for a... well, you get the point. There is simply no way a person under stress is going to remember specific defenses for specific attacks. Action is faster than reaction and by the time you have figured out what is coming it is too late. There is just no for ""forgiveness"", so to speak, in that type of training. If you miscalculate the attack, or you lose it on step 3 of a 6 step technique, your brain has to disengage for a second or two and process the situation. This is a second or two you simply do not have! Moreover, it is a clear violation of Hick's Law, which states the more options you have at your disposal the longer it takes for your brain to decide which one to use. Khan limits the techniques one must learn, and that helps. And KM, or at least Khan's version of it, seems more philosophical than technique based.

Having said that, however, David does offer something of a solution. It is called Retzev, a Hebrew word that means ""continuous motion"". Basically, the idea is that once you start defending yourself you don't stop until the threat is no longer a problem. Granted it will take some time -- a few months of dedicated training, minimum -- to develop this ability, but it does eventually negate the specific defense and Hick's Law issues for the most part. You will eventually get to the point where you don't think, you just react. I just think we can shortcut the process by not focusing on specific defenses in the first place. Give me a single, effective response whether the dirtbag has a fist, club, knife, or gun any day of the week. One solution to cover as many scenarios as possible. Kahn's close. Certainly closer than any traditional martial art, but he's not quite there yet.

The most valuable section of the book is not the techniques or really even the philosophy. As mentioned, this is all pretty instinctual stuff that you do already or at least will pick up quickly. No, as important as all that is, the most valuable section is the 12-week workout in the back. It is basically a daily schedule of drills that, should you follow, will go far in helping you develop your retzev ability.

For the record, I do not know David Khan, though I would like to meet him one day and would love the opportunity to train with him (and maybe a beer or three.) I do, however, own all three of his books and his first set of DVD's (He has since come out with a Vol. 2 DVD set that I have yet to review.) Now it's been said that you cannot learn a ""martial art"" from a book. For the most part this is true. I shudder at the thought of someone trying to learn, say Aikido, from a book or even a DVD. Such arts are like a Swiss watch: fine tuned and intricate. You need an instructor there, watching over your shoulder, making sure you're doing everything exactly as required. Not so with Khan's material. It's simple, effective, down and dirty street fighting. So I respectfully disagree. If one were to invest in Khan's books and DVD's, pick up some minimal equipment (e.g., a Century BOB dummy), and follow his 12-week schedule, one very much could learn to defend oneself in the comfort of home. There is nothing fancy here, and that is what makes it brutally effective. The challenge will be in maintaining the intensity you will experience in a real fight. You must work out hard. Maybe harder than you have ever done before, to create the kind of stress you will be under in a true attack. It is safe to say most people are not that prepared (set a timer and run a full-force, three minute drill on a heavy bag or BOB dummy... it's a LOT longer than you think!). But if you have the will power and determination to do it, you don't need a school or dojo. The question is, do you have what it takes?

David not only explains the techniques and movements, but also explains the ""why"" behind them and when/where they would be applicable.

4531491,5,B0052T6XLY,"I had a good bit of buyer's remorse because of the price. I never spent so much on a DVD but when it arrived, I knew it was well worth the cost after just ten minutes.

I was extra surprised a week or two later when Mr. Kahn himself contacted me and invited me to train at his facility should I ever find myself in his area. At first, I thought this might be a bit of a scheme to pad reviews, but he and I actually bantered back and forth through emails a few times and I must say that he is genuinely a fantastic guy.

As for the DVDs, I think the best part is the realism. Throughout each seminar, you certainly feel as though you are being trained to handle a street fight, which is not something other martial arts typically play to. You truly begin to see through the demonstration that this is more than just Israeli karate, but a spectacularly different beast altogether. Unlike other self-defenses which focus on form and technique that is too unrealistic for a real brawl, Mr. Kahn teaches combat awareness, fluid movement, and other great skills that will quickly end the fight rather than draw it out. This isn't to suggest that no use of stances or blocking exists in Krav Maga, but more emphasis is placed on avoiding blows and instant retaliation.

If you are looking for a visceral form of self-defense that gets the job done quickly, this is your tell-all guide. When he finishes volume 2, I will be among the first in line. I also suggest checking out his books. I picked up the weapon defense one on Kindle shortly after seeing how good his DVDs are.",1375747200,5,1568,4.381443298969073

Each technique is demonstrated from multiple angles, and in slow and real speed so everyone will know how to perform each technique after viewing these DVDs. They did not dwell on any one point too long and doing so keeps things interesting and moving at an easy to watch pace.
David even keeps things entertaining too. He verbalizes when he lands each technique to emphasize the point of each strike. ""VROOM!"" ""POCK!"".  It reminded me of the 1960s Batman TV series whenever someone would make a strike in a fight. Truly this adds to the entertainment value and is not annoying.

I beleive that not only should the cirruculum be practical and useful in a real life violent encounter (not only in training), but that the integrity of the system be preserved.  Thats not to say the techniques never evolve and the cirriculum remains static, but that the intentions of the systems founder, Imi Lichtenfeld, be preserved. I believe that U.S. Chief Instructor David Kahn, under the IKMA led by Haim Gidon, has acheived this.  The techniques you will find in the DVD's are excellent as is the commentary (explanations) along with them.  I have seen other DVD's at a much higher price that lack the true instruction and explanation that these do.  These DVD's are essential material for any true Krav practitioner.

From all the instructors I have met I honestly think David Kahn is one of the best in the world. It is easy to teach someone in person but incredible hard to convey the same message in a DVD. David and his team have accomplished that without a doubt. The techniques are shown from different angles and explained thoroughly. The slow motion is wonderful because you can really see how the punches - kicks are delivered wand what impact they have.
I enjoyed the DVDs and David's style. His honesty in the additional footing is refreshing. Krav Maga is not meant to be ""pretty"", even though there is beauty in the moves. Krav Maga is a way to survive an attack. As a woman I can appreciate the basic moves applied in a defense situation (if the heartbeat is over 120bpm you don't remember anything fancy anyway), as a martial artist I enjoy the precision and execution of the moves.

4531503,5,B0052T6XLY,"WARNING: You will not learn true Krav Maga just by watching a video or reading a book.

YOU MUST TRAIN.

Kravists train and study, they drill and drill and drill, and when they are not physically drilling they are putting aside time to visualize and to study.

Herein lies the tremendous value of David Kahn's books and video series. Used as companion pieces, these are essential materials for kravists of every level to drill, study, train, practice, and to use to pay it forward by sharing the skills with loved ones. Whatever school or style you've learned, Kahn's instruction will sharpen, enhance, or simply add dimension to your responses to situational variations.

The books and video series are steeped in the best tradition of self-defense instruction: stuffed with krav maga history, fight philosophy, statistical information on violence, real life anecdotes, and clear depictions of techniques with simple explanations of their fundamentals and principles.

The 12 week training programs laid out in the books are immensely enhanced with the help of the videos.

Find a partner or two or three or many or find a class and go train. Buy David Kahn's books and video series for the very best in homework material you can practice with classmates, friends, or your spouse.

Whatever your level of skill, these materials will be an immense help in intensifying your basics and exposing you to IKMA variations.

And, by the way, you can't lose at these prices, either.",1368316800,3,1475,5.016393442622951

4531505,5,B0052T6XLY,"I purchased 'Mastering Krav Maga 6 DVD Set' by David Kahn and I am glad that I did.  The DVD set far exceeded my expectations for I had wanted a 'set of tools' to teach me the basics of street self defense.  Two of my friends have been attacked and robbed on the street and I am a potential soft target. I wanted a system that was straightforward, immediate, potent and reasonably easy to learn. 'Mastering Krav Maga' fulfilled all of my requirements and far more.
David's excellent style of teaching, direct to the point and no nonsense descriptions of moves and situations shines through both in the DVDs and in his books.  In many scenarios, multiple ways of dealing with an attack are demonstrated. This flexibility impressed me because it gives me options rather than a single way of dealing with an attacker.  Again, the demonstrations of  'continuous combat' or retzev are impressive in that the attacker becomes the attacked and would hardly have a chance to fight back. The combat demonstrations are amazing and stunningly effective and the filming is excellent.  Thanks David.",1367193600,2,1086,4.8432432432432435
4531506,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga is one of the best box sets I have owned! David's reputation within the Krav Maga community is impeccable, and it's easy to see why! Each move is clearly demonstrated and easy to follow whether you've had martial arts training or not. This is not the aerobic Krav Maga you hear so many negative things about from serious combat martial artists. In fact, David is an instructor for the New Jersey State Police and many other organizations demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of his techniques. I have trained most of my life in the practical close combat application of Jujitsu, Boxing, and Muay Thai. David Kahn's Krav Maga is at the top of my list! A quick word on customer service. David sent me a personal message through Amazon to thank me for my order. I replied asking a question about technique and training and David called me and spent over a half hour answering my questions! Unfortunately, as with every great martial arts, there are many people popping up claiming to be the real deal. So before I bought this set I spent about a month doing intensive research to find a legitimate Krav Maga instructor. David's name continually came up as an authentic and reliable teacher. Not one negative statement was found! In conclusion, let me say I could not be happier with David's product, customer service, and more importantly, his personal integrity and skill as a martial artist!",1365724800,2,1434,4.833333333333333

Though my training in KM is limited, and of course no DVD will ever replace real world training, this is a must buy for those interested in self defense or unarmed combat. The DVDs are good quality and the instruction is among the best I have ever seen. Mr. Kahn explains the principle of the combative and then demonstrates it different ways. For those of you in the military you will understand the principle of ""violence of action"" which is portrayed throughout the series. Much like basic training, Mr. Kahn explains/demonstrates the principles and then builds upon that foundation througout the series. I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Khan, but watching his videos and reading his books I have to say the he is one of the best intstructors. Again, video doesn't replace real world training, but if you want to supplement your training or just see what it is about before you get into it full time, BUY IT!",1362355200,2,1132,4.693467336683417

4531515,5,B0052T6XLY,"I am not a stranger to the Martial Arts.  Outside of Krav Maga, over the years I have trained in Taekwondo, Tai Chi Chaun, Muay Thai, and attended a Navy SEAL advanced training and Sniper training course where I was trained in hand to hand combat by Navy SEALs.  I had the honor of meeting and training with David Kahn at a Krav Maga seminar he ran in Norwalk Connecticut which covered groundfighting techniques in January of 2013.  The only way to describe David is that he is the real deal.  The combination of his mastery of Krav Maga and his friendly and approachable demeaner make him the ideal instructor.  Mastering Krav Maga volume 1 is the best martial arts DVD set I have ever owned.  In this DVD Set, David covers technicques from  the yellow, orange, and green belt curriculum including upper body combatives and defenses, lower body combatives and defenses, Retzev(continueos combat moition), choke and grab releases, takedowns, clinces, groundfighing, and how to fight multiple opponents.  The techniques in the videos are marveously explained and broken down, as David shows them from multiple angles, and performs them in both slow motion so you can learn them properly, and at faster speeds so you can witness their power.  Israli Krav Maga is in my opinion the best tactical fighting/defense symtem around, born to battle antisemitism just before WWII, Krav Maga remains the official fighing system of the Israli Defense forces making the moves of Israli Krav Maga field tested and reliable.  David serves as the Israeli Krav Maga Association's Chief Instructor in the United States teaches this system in its purest form to all that are willing to learn including the public, celebrities, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies as well as the U.S. Military.  While Krav Maga cannot truely be mastered by watching a DVD, this set will prove to be an invaluable asset to your development in Krav Maga.  It can be used as a refresher between lessons and seminars with a certified expert, or as an introduction to Israeli Krav Maga before beginning professional training.",1360886400,,2098,4.962857142857143
4531516,5,B0052T6XLY,"I am a Krav Maga 1st degree black belt, and instructor from one of the other large KM organizations, and I can sincerely say that David Kahn's representation and presentation of the system is spot on.  Not only has he preserved some of the ""classic"" techniques such as the ""Educational Defense"", but in many cases I feel that the techniques he demonstrates have been evolved even further, in keeping with the true spirit of openness in Krav Maga.  The emphasis that is placed on attacking the trifecta of soft-targets (eyes, throat and groin) is exactly what should be emphasized for self-defense situations, and I applaud Mr. Kahn for not being ""politically correct"" on these DVD's and glossing over it.  The other topic that you will not likely hear from any other Krav organization is the subject of DVD #4, Retzev attacks, and I highly recommend watching it, and then watching it again, and then implementing the techniques and ideas into your own practice.

While it will always benefit a beginner to receive instruction from a qualified instructor, they can certainly pick up a very solid foundation in Krav Maga practice and self-defense from this DVD series, and even experienced practitioners like myself will find some really useful tools to add to our toolbox.  Additionally, if one pays careful attention, and does not mind hitting rewind a few times to pick up on the nuances of the techniques, Mr. Kahn throws in some more advanced techniques here and there that are definitely worth learning and mastering.

I personally really enjoyed watching the DVD's and have added several new techniques to my arsenal because of them.  I will definitely be watching them again, and would highly recommend this DVD series and Mr. Kahn's books to anyone interested in learning the essential Krav Maga.",1360713600,,1803,4.970099667774086

Generally speaking, most of schools wanna teach the techniques slowly as possible to lock down the students, but david kahns class was like ....after warm up and stretch, get into real situation right away, punch and block, kicks and joint locking, and strategy and tactics and psychological attitude. I heavily recommend any one who can make a trip to nj, pls try his class, david was kind and warm and very friendly, yet fast and precise and trying to share and teach most as possible in every single class, most of his students were so well trained, none of them seemed to be afraid of confronting physical attacks from streets. students ages were from 18-60.. any age range groups can join. I was trained in kungfu, judo, okinawa karate muay thai and capoeira.. i traveled from Korea to Henam-china, Chiang mai-thailand, Okinawa-Japan and Salvador-brazil. and honestly i can say David kahn s dvd and actuall training classes were one of most effective and valuable experience. My next martial art trip will be in Israel with David Kahn. Plus when 2nd dvd comes out, i will be the first one to order.

The past year I've been reviewing several of the leading Krav Maga systems, and the IKMA material that is presented in this volume is the best I've seen. The DVDs are a very comprehensive introduction to the unarmed techniques and tactics that make KM such an effective system. I was pleased to see that it didn't include some of the fancier kicking techniques that some of the other systems include in their curriculum. I don't believe fancy kicks (i.e., spinning or jumping) have any place in a self defense setting. The majority of the techniques seemed to focus less on individual athleticism to pull off, and more on training / aggression.

This set is a great compliment to David's three books on Krav Maga, which I also can't recommend enough.",1345593600,2,390,4.705882352941177
4531544,5,B0052T6XLY,"I have been training in Krav Maga under different instructors for 4 years, and I have to say that Mr Kahn is an excellent instructor. He is very passionate about sharing Krav Maga with others. His DVDs are an excellent source of information for anyone who wants to learn proper Isreali techniques. The quality of these DVDs are picture perfect and the audio is crystal clear. Mr Kahn explains each demonstrated method perfectly and in great detail, as he is motivated to teach his students properly.
These DVDs are definitely helping me retain the techniques I have learned from my classes and in my current trainings; they are an excellent resource to go back to and learn from again and again.  If you are passionate about Krav Maga and have always wanted to improve and hone your skills, I recommend Mastering Krav Maga By David Kahn. They are well worth it and you will not regret it. Thank you Mr Kahn, I cannot wait for Mastering Krav Maga Weapon Defenses (Volume Two).",1345161600,3,975,4.6686046511627906
4531545,5,B0052T6XLY,"David Kahn does a fantastic job presenting the core Krav Maga techniques in a clear format that is easy to understand.  Many martial arts videos are filled with a lot of extra talk and minimize the quality of the presentation of the techniques.  David provides just the correct amount of explanation along with an explosive fluid demonstation on how each techniques/movement works.  He performs them superbly and at speed, so that the viewer knows the technique can actually be done not just described.  In addition, many of the techniques are performed at multiple angles for an even clearer presentation.

This format allows for over 275 techniques ranging from upper and lower body attacks and defenses to non-sport groundwork to be presented clearly and concisely.  Over six hours of material is presented.  A lot of information for a great price!

He moves seamlessly from technique to technique first showing the fundamentals on each disk and then building on them to move to more advanced techniques.  In addition, each of the videos integrates with the others showing the elements of a complete system.  The techniques and movements are simple yet powerful derived from the basics of human instinctive movement.  This means they are utilizable by individuals of all ages, sizes and both genders.  Both beginning and advanced students can learn something that will increase their probability of surviving a self-defense encounter.

I can not encourage anyone enough, who is interested in the Krav Maga solution to self defense, to pick up these videos as well as read David's books and, if able, attend his classes and seminars.

This set of DVD 's  is bar none the best reference material on self Defence that I have seen . The concepts are very easy to grasp , and I can see the influences of many solid martial arts in this system taught in a no nonsense straight to the point method. Krav Maga uses the best techniques from many of the best martial arts and avoids the fancy , dangerous , low success rate techniques found in so many systems. David is clearly a very qualified instructor in Krav , and this product will be useful for both advanced and new comers to the reality based world of self Defence. As a practitioner of Brazilian Jujitsu I was skeptical of the ground work tape until I reviewed it . Solid concepts and easy to apply.

The video illustrates techniques from a variety of angles which gives the student the same perspective of the movements as if they were in the gym.

Mr. Kahn lays out the fundamentals in the beginning and builds on them as the videos progress.  His fundamental approach to instructing will answer your questions as they arise throughout the set.

The experience with David Khan started well - delivery was prompt, then a very personable follow-up email to check all was well and volunteering further assistance if required. Best of all, the product itself exceeded expectations. David Kahn presents the material in a very clear, concise and very precise manner. No wasted time waiting for information to come across - just graceful, elegant and powerful manoeuvres, all demonstrated first slowly from different angles, then again, at lightening speed!

I am picking up techniques from the DVD's that are very helpful.  I feel that my skill level is improving much faster because of the DVD's then if I was training without them.

I already knew, from having trained under him, that David Kahn is a highly proficient practitioner of Krav Maga, so I was not at all surprised that his skill really came through in the videos.

One thing, in particular, that I liked about this series is that it is not like some other DVD series I've seen in which the instructors displayed an almost cartoonish affect which made it hard to take them seriously.  While ALL self-defense instructional videos are to some extent (and NECESSARILY) choreographed to show specific ways to address specific attacks, the demonstrations in this series look like what I believe they should--VIOLENCE.  I believe that David did as good a job as one can (while still observing safety restrictions and concern for one's training partners) of conveying to the viewer the nature of the violence that they may face if attacked as well as the nature and level of violence that may be required of them to REPEL such attacks.

In addition, I liked the fact that so many of the solutions to the problems are effective, yet not excessively complicated...which I've always viewed as the true beauty of Krav Maga.  Overall, this an excellent product and accords top-notch treatment to the subject matter.",1342137600,,1334,4.906666666666666

While Krav Maga has developed into a ""system"" of ranks and levels, David Kahn has created this DVD series not to self promote or create further dependence but rather to teach the core basic building blocks of this combat art in a way that anyone can learn and develop. Mr. Kahn has also done a great job at helping the student become aware of the true nature of conflict - Murphy's law rules: ""Anything that can possibly go wrong - will"".

I would list this DVD series as core to my library to be referenced time and time again. Keep it simple and master the basics - this DVD shows you how. A great find and highly recommended.",1340668800,2,711,4.3059701492537314

Mr. Kahn's DVD is simply excellent.  It covers a massive amount of Krav Maga material in a succint, practical and easy to follow fashion.

Having spoken to David directly, I can say that he is not only professional and dedicated, but also kind and generous.  This reviewer was looking to train through someone with a good heart, and David has just that.  You can be assured of being in good, capable hands when you train through this DVD.

I was hesitant because I thought the content might be so advanced that I would not be able to use it. However, getting the DVDs was not a mistake. Krav maga makes sense and David Kahn is an excellent instructor. He is all business and does not waste time getting to the point. The quality of the instruction makes krav maga easily accessible to anyone who is willing to learn and practice. David thoroughly covers the bases of physical technique with careful demonstration and explanation. This is a professional presentation that does not skimp on hardcore useful information about the realities of interpersonal violence and practical techniques of self-defense.

This is a straightforward professional instruction covering everything one would need to know. It's done in such a fashion that unlike others, there's no time wasted yet just enough time spent on each move from all angles to be able to learn. I bought 2 other different one which I never bothered viewing entirely due to too much chatter about nothing. David's product you can see that it is actually geared towards professional security originally, and that is great, no messing around. Can't say how important it is for these types of instructionals to get to the point, and repeat the point enough times so that you remember. Any deviations with background stories and chit chat, breaks concentration and defeats the purpose.

David is an amazing instructor and the techniques that he teaches are very easy to learn and applicable in real world combat. I've worked in Iraq and other austere locations as a protection specialist since 2003 and have learned Krav Maga/Israeli Combat Methods through a variety of sources. In real world combat... Krav Maga works!!!This DVD will show you how.

David and his team will show you how to defend yourself in a short period of time. This DVD will aid tremendously in building your confidence and understanding of Krav Maga. I trained with Dave a few years ago and his teachings have save my a$$ on more than one occasion as an international protection specialist. I travel alot to many countries alone and Dave's training gives me the confidence to do this.

This DVD is about combat. Pure and simple. As a protection specialist I have to keep my edge when it comes to my clients safety and this DVD travels with me everywhere I go. During my down time I can review tips and techniques that work best for me. David give a multitude of ways to use Krav Maga and he always stresses ""It's your Krav!"", meaning use the techniques that work best for you.

As a Sensei, Peace Officer, and professional soldier, I have no problem saying that Krav Maga is the best self-defense system I have ever used or seen, and David Kahn is the best teacher of Krav that I have ever seen. In short, buy this product. I have seen too many MMA guys floating around thinking they are great fighters. They may be...in the ring. The fact is, the cage may keep your opponent in, but it also keeps his buddies out. The cage has no place in the street. Krav Maga rules in terms of street self-defense. The nation of Israel was forged in war and survives in the same atmosphere. This is the breeding grounds of effectiveness and efficiency, and Krav Maga, and the Gidon System specifically, is the child of this environment. Israel is a master of self-defense. Israel was created in an area where she is surrounded by her enemies and yet is still able to survive. It makes sense that a system like Krav is designed to do the same. It does just that.

I have been doing martial arts for a long time, not Krav, and have picked up many items that have made my skills better.  BTW, it is recommended that you get the books that complement this series.

I think that it seems sometimes that they kind of made up what they would do as they recorded. I think that the video could have had slo mo for the moves because sometimes they go too fast and they move on. The screens with the words or tips on moves always goes by before I can read all of it and I am a pretty fast reader. All in all I think this set is pretty good.,1332979200,10,456,3.8105263157894735

Each DVD is packed with essential Krav Maga techniques. David gives clear and direct instruction on the basics, and considering that Krav Maga is a simple but effective self defense he teaches you almost all you need to know to understand the system from the ground level. In fact it was so much I was a little overwhelmed at first, but then realized I can go over it as many times as I wanted, slow it down and learn at my own pace. Considering what you would pay to take classes this price is amazing. Although after watching these DVD's I really would like to get some hands on training.

As others have noted you can tell David really knows his stuff and respects his art. If you have a partner to practice with, especially holds, take-downs, and control techniques this set is all you need to get started. That, and one of those life-like punching bags (body opponent bags) to really practice hitting full force.

I think if you really want to learn Krav Maga and are looking for a place to start, or if you don't have access to a quality instructor, then this set would be very beneficial. Even if you do take classes it is a great way to hone your skills.

First, in this day and age of self promotion, it is nice to see someone of this stature pay such homage to his teacher.  It is also clear that David is more concerned with teachning and teaching properly than with self promotion.

I have to strongly disagree with the review that said this set is for only advanced students.  I think the set is very well thought out and suits everyone from beginners to those who already have advanced knowledge.  There is logical progression to each dvd and to the set as a whole.  For beginners, just spend more time with each DVD and I am confident you will feel that the set was developed just for you.  For the more advanced students, you will pick up some great tidbits that many other instructors either do not know, or fail to communicate properly.

There is a reason that Krav Maga is recognized world wide as world class system of self defense.  It is not a martial art. It is about how to be safe in dangerous real world, not contrived, situations.  The system is as brutal as it is simple.  It is not based upon strength, speed, or athleticism.  Instead it is based upon gross motor skills which anyone can effectively utilize.

David does a great job of making this simple system very digestable for everyone.  So, this set will sit in the forefront of my library and I very strongly suggest this set for both begginers and those well versed in the system.",1331337600,,1603,4.475862068965517

David is one of the best instructors I have ever studied under and his DVD's are almost as great as he is. Mastering Krav Maga is a MUST HAVE for practitioners of the art as well as those who are looking to learn Krav but don't have a school near them. Buy the DVD's...you won't regret it!",1328745600,,554,4.091743119266055
4531581,5,B0052T6XLY,"In over 30 years in martial arts I have amassed a large library of books, video tapes, and DVDs. With most of them you have to sift through a lot of sand and rocks to find those valuable nuggets, with David Kahn's DVD series on Mastering Krav Maga, that is not the case, it is all a treasure. This is must have for all serious students of practical martial arts/self defense. It is the next best thing to attending one of David Kahn's seminars or training in his dojo. This is serious Krav Maga straight from Israel, it is alive, it is evolving and adapting art. David Kahn is bringing it to you in a format that you can watch over and over again, and get something new from it every time. Would have been well worth my money at twice the price, I give it 5 stars. I eagerly await David's next book on Krav Maga Weapons defenses.
 I read one review that was critical of the DVDs because it did not demonstrate advanced unarmed lethal force techniques and I would like to address this. If you want to learn advanced unarmed lethal force techniques of Krav Maga you are going to have to go through some vetting process with the organization in America or Israel. To put that information out to where just anyone has access to it, to include terrorist and criminals would be irresponsible and unethical. In almost 35 years in martial arts, to include 5 black belts, and 22 years in the Marine Corps, I have never trained in a program or school that we taught advanced unarmed lethal force techniques to anyone who has not been screened and vetted. Regardless of the ethical dimension, advanced unarmed lethal force techniques require a certain level of mastery of at least the fundamentals of martial arts (i.e. Krav Maga combatives). Further, snapping the human neck or any other rapidly fatal technique is not as easy as Hollywood makes it look in the movies. Reality is not Hollywood in which someone can go from zero to hero in only six weeks of training with Mr. Miyagi, and even then Mr. Miyagi did not teach Daniel to break necks in the first movie, or the second, or the third. This DVD set is fantastic training, I wish I had access to this information long ago when I was younger and coming up in martial arts, it would have saved me a lot of time and brought me to a higher level of proficiency much more quickly. In closing, you are not going to find a more authentic Israeli Krav Maga instructor in the US than David Kahn.",1327795200,,2432,4.428571428571429

As a  former federal law enforcement officer I  received much training in combative techniques from the government, not to mention years of training on my own. David Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga series is a great addition to the knowledge and techniques I had already developed.  Krav Maga has assembled a cross section of the most effective combative techniques, with some variation,  and combined them with a very aggressive fighting style.  David does a great job explaining and demonstrating these techniques and he adroitly explains the simple and natural progression of the system.  Thank you David,  Looking forward to your next DVD set.",1327449600,,705,5.2792792792792795

If your looking to learn Krav Maga the traditional way that it is taught in Israel than I highly recommend these DVDs.,1326844800,,385,4.4714285714285715
4531586,4,B0052T6XLY,"Overall, this dvd is very informative, and the video and audio quality is good. The reason I took away a star is because there wasn't enough slow motion recaps. I had to end up rewinding alot and pausing to understand the techniques before David moved on to the next technique. I previously watched a dvd on free form fighting with Bas Ruten. He would go step by step through each move, then show the move at realistic speed, then show in slow motion. Thats what this dvd should do.",1326758400,15,482,4.426966292134831
4531587,5,B0052T6XLY,"I highly recommend buying this DVD set if you want true Krav Maga and not some watered down modified version. David Kahn is the U.S. Chief Instructor for the IKMA which is headed by Grandmaster Haim Gidon. Krav Maga founder Imi Lichtenfeld appointed Haim Gidon as his successor. The techniques taught by Mr. Kahn in this DVD set are pure authentic Israeli Krav Maga straight from Netanya, Israel.  The Krav Maga David Kahn teaches is simple to understand and easy to execute. It is very gross motor and not some complicated fine motor manipulation that you wouldn't be able to apply in a real world scenario. Most martial arts may work in the comfort of a dojo but fail when applied in a real attack because of how complicated the movements are and their inability to deal with your body's fight or flight response.
Mr. Kahn teaches upper and lower body combatives and defenses as well as takedowns and takedown defense, controls, clinching and dealing with multiple attackers. He also teaches ground fighting. His ground fighting instruction is not sport based it is street based, instead of teaching an arm bar to submission he teaches you to break the arm and get up.  Also the DVD contains chokes and choke defenses, and my favorite the garrote choke defense. Mr. Kahn emphasizes the importance of continuous combat motion (retzev). Keep attacking with combatives until the threat has been neutralized.
If you want to learn how to survive a real world attack then I highly recommend this DVD set.",1326585600,5,1500,4.832684824902723

You are able to follow simples steps to defend yourself in many differents situations in life. Practicing with these easy steps gave me the confidence to keep practicing far away and to maintain my self defence level.
I like to become an Instructor one day with David and glad I am able to follow this DVD as my teaching tool to improve my knowledge with Krav Maga. I am a fan of this DVD and totally recommend it to everyone!",1325548800,,537,4.38

The box set compliments the books written by Mr. Kahn wonderfully.  As a police officer in a major metropolitan city, it is imperative that I maintain a level of training that will keep me from getting my butt handed to me, or worse,  This system has given me the skills and confidence needed to perform my job to the best of my ability.  Now understand, I stand 5'8"" and weigh about 170 lbs, so I am not an opposing figure who strikes fear in the hearts of evil doers around the town.  But the confidence I have gained through training in krav Maga through Mr. Kahn's books and DVD's is invaluable, and yes I have applied some of what I have learned in real world situations.

They're main training center was in NJ so I had to travel from NYC to go train.  I have seriously learned some amazing techniques from them that blew away all past training I've had in tae kwon do, praying mantis kung fu & more. Their fighting style is in such a way where you end up going ""why didn't I think of that, that's brilliant!""  After seeing the DVDs it's EXACTLY how I was taught.  Nowadays I live half-time in NYC & half-time upstate NY, & I know David just opened up a school in NYC.  I'm going be a member there & be there as time permits, but I have my DVDs with me upstate for when I can't.  Even if you train in other martial arts or MMA, you must get these DVDs b/c it will help you add some bad a** techniques to your arsenal.  A definite must for people who learn, Judo, BJJ, Karate, law enforcement, military, boxing, muai thai, & definitely helpful for women to know this.",1322697600,,1026,4.1206030150753765
4531592,5,B0052T6XLY,"I have studied and trained in a multitude of martial arts and reality based defense systems over the last 30 years (including several different evolutions of Krav Maga).
I also own a considerable amount of book and video based material on the subject.

The Mastering Krav Maga DVD set by Mr. Kahn is the best instructional material on unarmed personal protection that I have ever owned.

The video quality is easily on par with the best production videos on the market with clear sharp picture and sound.  Unlike other instructional DVDs, you won't see the same technique repeated 12 times in slow motion.  Each technique is explained and demonstrated only a few times allowing you to get more techniques per disc than in other KM DVDs.  Mr. Kahn's teaching style is very dynamic and he provides detailed explanations for techniques presented.  His movements are explosive and fluid and he provides a great visual example of how each movement should be executed.

 I really ought to add that Mr. Kahn's books are a great way to supplement your DVD training as they provide additional insights into technique utilization and application. The books also provide a solid training progression to develop your ability to seamlessly integrate your body's combat tools into your defensive response to aggression.

Most importantly, the technique content was exceptional.  You may find a few techniques reminiscent of older Krav Maga,  but much of this material will be new to those who are studying earlier evolutions of the system.  Where this material really shines is that key biomechanical issues present in earlier evolutions of Krav Maga now appear to be recognized and fixed, providing the student with a higher probability of success in application.

I am anxious to see Mr. Kahns new book on weapon defenses and truly hope he decides to release a companion DVD set.  It would be great to see the entire Gidon system committed to training DVD for those of us not fortunate enough to be near a qualified instructor.

Anyone interested in Krav Maga, personal protection, or self defense should pick this DVD set up today.  You'll be glad you did!",1322611200,22,2145,4.966386554621849

Dave Cahn knows this fighting art form inside and out and that is clearly demonstrated in this set of DVD's. Dave provides a well rounded comprehensive tutorial that is easy to follow and quickly apply with the right amount of dedication and practice. Dave's demonstrations are thorough and complete.

The video that David Kahn has created demonstrates the highly effective and elegantly simple
system of Krav Maga. In an era when the name Krav Maga has been diluted by many pretenders and
so-called authorities, David Kahn teaches the Krav Maga as Israel deploys it today.
His videos are well conceived, logically structured and a major aid to anyone wanting to learn
the authentic style.

Other DVDs on the market that are labeled as Definitive, Ultimate, or Black Belt, are an interesting composite
of techniques where the attacks are half speed and the techniques more remedial or focus more on total aggression of defense
rather than perfecting the technique needed to be executed. David Kahn's video take into account real time fighting scenarios,
at full speed and with a higher measure of urgency. Simply put, if David's techniques is off, he would be at risk of serious injury.
This is more realistic and more in keeping with what a Krav practitioner will need to learn. Self defense with the speed and aggression
of attack being met with brutal yet simply elegant counters.

There is even footage of David showing these same techniques to the military...what more would you need to see? If the US military
is trusting our soldiers with his knowledge, why wouldn't we?

That is very helpful for someone like myself who has not had formal self defense training.  David makes sure that the movements are performed at different angles so you can see it done from the front, back, side, etc.  The DVD's are put together in such a way that from the first one to the last the information is building on the basics.  One thing David stresses throughout the set is to only use force when necessary.  Always try to end a confrontation without using force.  That is what we all need to think about in our everyday lives.  Therefore, as you watch and learn, you are also given a better understanding of the need to use force to protect yourself or your family.  If your not interested in buying this for self defense, buy it for the workout one gets from doing krav maga. It is a great cardio and fat burner to do the techniques he shows you.  To close, David and his entire staff that made this educational DVD set are professional to a tee!!!!!

8454431,5,B0052T6XLY,"Bottom line up front.  David Kahn and his team are, by far, the best there is, and teach the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement (LE), or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.

Historically, development of Self-defense systems and martial arts occurred from the necessities of the existing time-period and social norms concerning violence.  For example, Karate for the Samurai or Kali for villagers of the Philippines (whose conflicts were tribal and weapons of choice where whatever they had laying around).  Societies developed these systems and martial arts in order to, quickly and efficiently, train Soldiers. This was so they would possess the capabilities to close with and destroy their adversaries in hand-to-hand combat if and when necessary.  Imi Lichtenfeld designed Israeli Krav Maga in the 1940s in order to address the modern combatant.  Whether dealing with a mugger on the streets, or a foreign adversary on the battlefield. No other system is as modern or effective as Krav Maga.

The IKMA (GS) is the only true Krav Maga system under Grand Master Haim Gidon (successor to Imi Lichtenfeld).  It is, by far, any agencies best option for training its Soldiers and/or LE officers.  A single ten-hour seminar with David Kahn, and his team, proved to be worth a year of training in any other dojo I have attended.  I have trained on several forms of martial arts and self-defense systems.  I always shop around for the best instructor with the most practical training.  David and his team are undeniably the best there is.  I have driven fourteen hours at a time, on several occasions, to attend training with him.  I always leave the seminars absolutely motivated to come back to base and share what I learned with my Soldiers.

Krav Maga has grown in popularity in the west in recent decades.  There are several different interpretations of the system available in the US (e.g. Warrior Krav Maga /Krav Maga World Wide).  Most of them teach substandard techniques, with the addition of cardiovascular endurance training, in order to appeal to those more susceptible to advertising and marketing.  The idea being, Get fit and learn to defend yourself overnight.  While Krav Maga is designed to be simple to understand.  There still needs to be much emphasis on the subtle fine points that make any technique effective.  Far removed from the source, these schools often sacrifice proper technique for mass production.  This can have fatal consequences when someone uses those techniques for actual self-defense.  I have also frequented several introductory courses where the facility told me they strictly focus on civilian self-defense.  There are three tiers to Krav Maga (Military, Civilian, and Law Enforcement).  Any master of the system should know and be able to instruct them all.  As a Law Enforcement Officer, I also have a firm understanding of the Use of Force (UOF) continuum.  I also understand the legal ramifications for not understanding the UOF continuum.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are true masters of the system. They will ensure that the student gets every detail and piece of knowledge they require for the techniques they are taught to be effective.

Israeli Krav Maga under the IKMA (GS) is also a great plug and play system. If your agency has an existing system where you believe there are gaps in its current techniques, or dilemmas which your system does not address, Krav Maga will fill those gaps easily.  I have personally found this to be applicable for LE systems, military combatives, and other martial arts/self-defense systems alike.

Additionally, if you attend the seminars to get hands on training, and a professional instructors critique on your form (which I highly recommend), the DVDs and books hold nothing back in terms of helping you to refresh your memory.  The five books (approximately 1000 pages worth of instructional material) are extremely well articulated and literally spell out every detail you need to know from a strategic approach.  They articulate all the subtle nuances, which make a technique work.  The four DVD volumes (approximately 27 hours of instructional material) do an excellent job of using a by the numbers approach to teaching and demonstrating the technique, as well as elaborating on key points.  For those who have served in an instructor position, in either the military or law enforcement, the previously mentioned materials more than portray a Training Support Package (TSP) or Program of Instruction (POI).  In addition, the materials previously mentioned will entirely refresh your techniques acquired by any seminar attended in person with David.

Once again, bottom line up front.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are by far the best there is, teaching the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement, or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.",1526169600,22,5108,5.056152927120669
8454432,5,B0052T6XLY,Ive completed the dvds in Volume 1 and really felt that I received my moneys worth so I purchased volume 2 and am 1/2 way through the instructions and again I am satisfied with the content. The instructions supplement the instructions I receive from the classes I take.,1524700800,,269,4.625
8454433,5,B0052T6XLY,"Bought this set because I have little to no time to attend regular classes. All the gyms/schools near me only offer Taekwondo or MMA style fighting, and not Krav Maga. Krav Maga, in my opinion, offers immediate self-defense gratification. Package is put together so well, not some chintzy product thrown together. No doubt Mr. Kahn is an authority on the subject matter, and covers the material methodically, and at a speed that's easy to follow.  Instructions are first explained, then demonstrated at a realistic momentum, then re-performed at a slower pace, so as to capture every sequence of the movement(s).  After having covered all the material, I have confidence I can apply most, if not all, moves if needed to protect myself and/or family.  Only downside unrelated to the dvd set itself is that it would be helpful to have a partner in order to perform the mechanics of the moves.  Fortunately for me, Mr. Kahn's gym is within driving distance (..far for me, but doable) where I can attend w/e classes and have an instructor assist me in expanding my knowledge, as well as, fine tune what I've learned thru the videos.",1523577600,,1128,4.829015544041451

8454437,5,B0052T6XLY,Excellent set of instructional dvds for Krav Maga. David has put together a comprehensive training program for anyone interested in learning Krav Maga. Highly recommended.,1519084800,,171,5.88
8454438,5,B0052T6XLY,"Great video set. I am taking Krav Maga at a school where Mr. Kahn is the senior instructor and have found what this video demonstrates is what I have learned. It makes for a great reference for me when I am practicing the moves out side of class room. I highly recommend these videos to any one who wants to get serious about learning a self defense. The moves are, for the most part, simple to learn but take years to master. Learning just a few of the basic strikes and hold breaks will up your confidence to be able to get home if a situation turns violent. That is what this system is about, ending the fight quickly and efficiently. No fancy forms to learn, just respond, remove the threat, control the weapon (be it a hand or something more), and counter strike, and continue until you can safely escape the situation. Once you have the basic idea that on the street going home are the only points that count, you realize that Krav Maga is for you.",1516838400,4,954,4.335195530726257
8454439,5,B0052T6XLY,I'm a prior Infantryman and am a current Security Forces officer. We take our combative training very serious. These DVD's are excellent learning tools. Great instruction and very easy to follow along. This is real Krav Maga and not some fitness regime. Watching these DVD's and following along will help anyone at any skill level to progress quickly and have a greater understanding of the system. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking to learn real self defense. Great for beginners and seasoned practioners alike.,1516665600,4,527,5.068965517241379
