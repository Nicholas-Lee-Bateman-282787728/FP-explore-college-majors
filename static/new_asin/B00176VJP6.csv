8265073,2,B00176VJP6,"Pierre (Sergio Fantoni) is a Navy Lieutenant by his bars, a Chief Petty Officer by his collar insignia. He breaks up with his stripper girlfriend Jeanette (Susanne Loret) who immediately explodes her car going down an embankment. WOW! Do sailors really date strippers?

She is in a hospital with a slightly disfigured face, one that skin grafts could cure, or her long hair could cover...which it does for most of the movie. She believes her face will always be this way as she contemplates suicide with the gun she is packing in her purse while smoking cigarettes in her hospital room. My how things have changed.

Never fear, a woman with stereotypical sunglasses and a trench coat (Franca Parisi) shows up and offers her help through Professor Alberto Levin (Alberto Lupo) who has a machine that goes ping, an oscilloscope, a centrifuge, and a ""radiation chamber"" that could be an early microwave oven. His new product Derma 28 he wants to use on a human guinea pig, hence the stripper with the deformed face, one that he instantly falls in love with to the dismay of his assistant.

The professor uses the substance and it turns him into more of a hideous Mr. Hyde, than a vampire. I think ""Atom Age Mr. Hyde at Times"" wouldn't sell as well as the vampire thing. They could of at least gave him a long teeth. The make-up was pretty bad. It must have been stuff left over from our Lend-Lease program.

Not much in character build-up. Acting and script were pretty sad. Might have some film history interest as a vampire film worse than anything with Kristen Stewart in it. Just kidding Kristen, I really did like how you played a dead chick in that Snow White thing you otherwise ruined.",1390953600,,1690,4.642140468227424
