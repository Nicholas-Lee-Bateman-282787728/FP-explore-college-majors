8149273,2,B000J4QWU4,"Living in North Carolina, I purchased this product expecting some insight on ""Successful Strategies"" approaching our small,tight,rhodo choked mountain streams.  Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period.  No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct ""stab"" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed! I just feel this product targets only the fundamentals and nothing else. To the beginner, I give two thumbs up! For anyone else, I'm sorry, but it's not worth it.",1331424000,,742,5.073770491803279
