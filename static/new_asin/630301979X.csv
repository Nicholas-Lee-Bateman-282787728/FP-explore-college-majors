7838557,4,630301979X,"Rhythm and Weep - This one has always had a reputation of being one of the stooges' worst--regardless of 3rd stooge. Watching it again, I can't see why this short has been reviled over the years. Is it because it's a ""Sick Curly"" film? Is it the singing and dancing numbers that put people off? I've said this before--girls that pretty can dance for me anytime. The ""suicide"" angle is something else that has bothered fans, but I can't take it too seriously--especially when Moe states that he has to be at the cleaners at 2 'O clock, after jumping.
4 1/2 stars

Back From the Front - Another funny wartime short--probably best remembered for Stanley Blystone's classic line ""But Mein Fuhrer, we are Nazis, we have no brains."" 4 1/2 stars

The Three Troubledoers - One of the weaker ones from the ""Sick Curly"" time period. Not really good or bad, I think ""Meh"" would be the best description I have for it. There are some funny parts, but there are also a lot of scenes or gags that go nowhere, like the scene with Curly in the collar or Moe's special cannon. 3 stars

Overall, only the last short on this tape drags down the grade somewhat...",1458864000,,1142,4.454545454545454
7838558,3,630301979X,"RHYTHM AND WEEP is the funniest short here. I think it has some funny scenes, especially when the Stooges are about to jump off the building. Too many dancing scenes though. BACK FROM THE FRONT was okay, but not great. Moe does his Hitler impression also done in all three shorts on the THEY STOOGE TO CONGA tape. Good toward the end. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS was just too boring. There are a few funny scenes, but not enough. I don't usually like westerns.
An okay tape, but nothing special.",1012348800,2,490,4.51685393258427
7838559,2,630301979X,"RHYTHM AND WEEP (1946) - One of the worst Curly shorts. The whole short is basically a rip-off of the earlier Stooge shrost GENTS WITHOUT CENTS (1944). Both have the boys as actors, they run into 3 female dancers and they instantly fall in love with each other. They are all hired to do a play - the boys a comedy play, and the girls a dance number. I never thought much of GENTS to begin with because of the over-long musicals, but at least that has the classic ""Niagra Falls"" routine. RHYTHM doesn't really have much highlights.
BACK FROM THE FRONT (1943) - A good WWII film. Bud Jamison as the German officer is hilarious, and there are some good performances from the Stooges as well. Great to see Moe's Hitler impression again.
THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS (1946) - Pretty boring western.  My favorite parts were the scenes showing the Stooges riding on the triple-bike in fast-motion is hilarious, as well as Dick Curtis' double-take when seeing the sun fall, then quickly rising back up again. I didn't like the ending, though.
Pretty bad tape.",994118400,,1045,4.648648648648648
7838560,2,630301979X,"Curly fans will see very little of their hero's usual personality. Two of these shorts date from 1946, when Curly Howard was at the end of his career. (Very ill at the time, he struggled through these films and it  shows.) RHYTHM AND WEEP is the better of the two, with the Stooges  auditioning their song-and-dance act for a producer. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS  is a Western spoof that Curly just wasn't up to making. BACK FROM THE FRONT  is a wartime comedy with the Stooges doing their best to sabotage the  German war effort. Completists will want these episodes, but they aren't  prime Stooge material.",956793600,,604,4.704761904761905
7838561,3,630301979X,"Cleverness of gags - 3 stars.
New stuff - 1 star.
all three episodes are average stooge shorts.
I love these guys, but these are not in the first tier of Stooge skits, in spite of many neat Curly antics. I laughed  out loud often.
(When I watch the real classics, I laugh until I am  breathless. Not here.)",925516800,,306,4.169491525423729
