8612914,4,B00F7TRCIC,"Artificial Paradises or ""Parasos Artificiais"" in its original Portuguese is the latest film from director and writer Marcos Prado who brought us `Elite Squad' and the follow up `Elite Squad: The Enemy Within' which was a huge success and so I was expecting good things from this. It is about three people who come together on a beach rave called Shangri-La. This is a festival of `art and alternative culture' and so obviously everyone wants to get off their faces on illegal drugs whether it be ecstasy, GHB or more back to basics with peyote.

We meet DJ Erika (Nathalia Dill) and best friend Lara (Livia de Bueno) who have a very Bohemian attitude to everything and experience each other as much as they do life. Then they decide to have a threesome, as you do, and bring in a guy they rate at being the best looking. Well soon they are all painted up and ready to paartaay - yes that is a euphemism for more drugs. This man is Nando (Luca Bianchi -`Elite Squad: The Enemy Within') and he does not take much convincing to indulge.

The story is told in flash back with the story of where they are today playing out to give context to the consequences of what actually happened on that beach. The layers are slowly pulled back to reveal each mistake one at a time and just when you thought you had the whole picture, another layer is removed.

This is a truly well made and beautifully shot film I thought it would be all raves and monotonous music but was happily wrong on that account and the soundtrack is actually quite varied and compliments the mood very well. Brilliantly acted too, with everyone putting in creditable performances. This is set in Brazil and Amsterdam so is in Portuguese and a smattering of English. The subs are a bit poor which even have spelling mistakes, but that is not the fault of the producers and it is a small gripe in what was a really rewarding film to watch - recommended. I watched mine in the UK and from the product description here I can not tell if this copy is sub titled.",1380326400,,2018,4.448648648648649
