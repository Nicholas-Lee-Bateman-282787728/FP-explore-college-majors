8127685,4,B000FZEQEG,"Kiyoshi Kurosawa is one of my favorite a-horror directors. Doppelgnger is a different take from his usual brooding and haunting tales, but it is no less thought-provoking. MILD SPOILER WARNING

The film begins with the legend that when you see your doppelgnger you die. However, that turns out to be not necessarily true - at least not in the way that you would think. Instead, the film asks who you would be if you could release your inner sociopath. Sometimes, the answer is funny. Sometimes horrifying (and still kind of funny). The film is beautifully shot in a variety of locations that become greener and more expansive as the film progresses.

Definitely worth watching. Worth owning if you are a fan of Kurosawa or of Koji Yakusho (I am - of both).",1481500800,2,771,4.507142857142857
8127686,4,B000FZEQEG,"Not a horror movie, more of a dark comedy, with an understated, sardonic tone. The lead performance is great, and it goes in some unexpected and thought-provoking directions.",1466899200,,174,5.25
8127687,5,B000FZEQEG,Really nice film by the director of the original Pulse. Not really a horror film though. It's starts out like a horror but soon becomes a kind of philosophical comedy.,1454976000,,167,4.6
8127688,5,B000FZEQEG,"Director Kurosawa is good at giving each of his films their own unique feel. Here, Doppelganger explores a detective (Kurosawa favorite Kji Yakusho) as he literally faces his inner self.  It has a way of not letting you know what happens next and the dark humor throughout makes this a fun watch.",1335052800,,296,4.6923076923076925

8127690,2,B000FZEQEG,"Plot in a nutshell- Guy meets his double (""doppelganger"")while working on an ""arm-ed"" wheelchair. Nothing great really happens after that...or before.

Advertised from Tartan Asia Extreme. Thought this flick was J-horror but it turned out otherwise, and not very good at all. No ghosts, gore, or anything. Not sure what genre this flick should fall under... Overall not really worth a viewing.",1219795200,,393,5.338709677419355
