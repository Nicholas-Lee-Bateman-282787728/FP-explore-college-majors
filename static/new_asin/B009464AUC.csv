5257087,5,B009464AUC,"It often seems like there are no more ""firsts"" left.  These four kayakers are the first men to navigate the Grand Inga Rapids.  The fifty wildest miles of the Congo River.  An epic accomplishment and a story well told.",1379289600,,218,4.538461538461538
5257088,5,B009464AUC,I bought this DVD as a gift for a friend who is a white water kayaker. He repeatedly told me he LOVED it. And he said he had a showing for several of his friends who were equally impressed. I love it when I find the perfect gift. Thanks.,1364515200,,237,3.857142857142857
5257089,5,B009464AUC,"This documentary was enjoyable on several levels, it was problematic for the kayakers to gain access to the Congo River, but they were able to get permission for the helicopter to get to these remote areas. After that, it was an adrenaline rush to watch these world class athletes to battle the river. The turbulent waves were huge and it took some planning for them to choose the best oath. I can't believe they all lived to tell the tale. Buy it and enjoy.",1361059200,2,458,4.464285714285714

8535618,5,B009464AUC,"Certainly one of the better documentaries I have seen.  It has just enough non-kayak content that my wife enjoyed it and said was really good. (She doesn't whitewater kayak).  However, it had lots of cool footage so that I really enjoyed it.  It was a perfect balance of showing struggles to make this thing happen in a third world environment, showing history, showing teamwork, and getting good shots of the action.",1476748800,,417,4.845070422535211

8535620,5,B009464AUC,"This documentary embodies the best in river expeditions. It has all the elements of overcoming obstacles, teamwork, perseverance, & humbling transformation. I enjoyed the fact that this film is devoid of ego and reveals the hardships endured by the team of accomplished paddlers. This is not your typical whitewater film. The history of exploration on the Congo River makes for an intriguing storyline to this recent decent by Steve Fisher, Tyler Bradt, Rush Sturges, and Ben Marr. Excellent film!",1471564800,,497,5.30379746835443

8535625,5,B009464AUC,Great documentary on the Inga Rapids and the prior expeditions that went before.  The kayaking was amazing and rapids were insane.  The logistics of just getting there were unreal too.  Great movie if your adventure seeker or like expedition documentaries.,1434326400,,256,5.35
