2897741,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I can't wait for the release of the greatest tv show and sitcom in the history of television.  I have already place my pre-order on this classic tv gem.  We will finally have all six seasons and The Lucy-Desi Specials in one new boxed package.  The cover art is extraordinary.  In addition to Lucy's schenanigans, we will have a colorized version of the episode ""Lucy Goes to Scotland"" and the three episode compilation which is named ""The I Love Lucy Movie.""  I had seen a special screening of this when I was at the Loving Lucy 2001 Convention.  It's a rare treat.  I can only hope (now that the ""I Love Lucy"" series is finally completed) we will hopefully get ""The Lucy Show"" released in season sets.  I hope that this takes place in early 2008.  We need to have all of Lucy's work released on DVD.  She was the epitome of comedy and the Queen of situation comedy.  Hopefully, the airheads at CBS/Paramount will get their act together and start working on ""The Lucy Show.""  There is a big market for Lucy's work.",1188691200,4,1015,4.456521739130435

2897743,1,B000TGJ8B2,I purchased every season set of I Love Lucy and now I see this AND there are extras that I want but will have to spend another $220 just for one DVD.  Why can't the studios offer the extra features (and the collectors box) to all those who have already purchased the season prior.  Am I the only one pissed off by this?,1186790400,61,319,4.0476190476190474
2897744,1,B000TGJ8B2,"Yes, another box set..... and once again a lot of future buyers who won't buy this megaset because there are no subtitles or audio in other languages.

2897745,2,B000TGJ8B2,"I am very disappointed with the 2015 release of ILL Complete series (I own all previous release versions; season sets and complete series).  My initial order came in with season1 disc1 severely scratched.  Along with that, all discs with the exception of season 5 (discs 1,2 and 3) were silver format. The three S5 discs were prints with pictures on them from the original ILL release.  I assumed this was a mistake so returned the item for replacement due to the scratches and mismatched discs.  Amazon quickly replaced the item.  I received with no scratches but again the set is mismatched discs from previous releases.  So sad if this was an intentional decision by the distributor.

The positive -- I am really a fan of the packaging.",1185580800,29,739,4.771653543307087
2897746,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I Love Lucy The Complete Series is now being made available on DVD and there are rumors that the long awaited I Love Lucy may be included with the set, lets just hope that they also make a seperate disc as well for the movie for us fans that allready bought all of the seperate seasons of I Love Lucy on DVD. This Complete Series is now available for pre-order on various websites including Amazon and will release on October, 23, 2007!

With this set you get all 179 half hour episodes of I Love Lucy as well as 13 FULL hour episodes of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour on DVD for the low low price of only $168.99 and packaged beautifully plus digitally remastered to crystal clear perfection!!

 There will also be bonuses including Lucille Ball on the radio show ""My favorite Husband, rare commercials, clips in color, Desilu studio tour with Lucy and the gang and much more.. With the bonuses alone you get several hours of fun and if you bought the season DVD sets it will be much of the same bonuses in this complete series.

If you have never bought the Lucy season sets and you are a fan then you do not know what you are missing. The shows are in crystal clear picture quality and not like they were when DVD's were first made and VHS's also, these are so nice and remastered to perfection and clearer than what you will see on tv. I won't even watch I Love Lucy on the television anymore because the DVD's are so much clearer that it doesn't look right to watch it a little on tv.

 You not only get every single episode of the I Love Lucy show and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour to watch over and over again but you get never before seen bonuses that are very rare and some of these bonuses have never been seen on cable before now. This is the absolute perfect gift for any Lucy fan and is a must have collection to own!

I bought my season sets seperately as they were being made and I paid about $250 for the complete collection individually and the I Love Lucy movie was not even included, you will be very lucky to get that lost movie, which was recently found 50 years later after I love Lucy was produced and they may be adding that movie with this set. The I Love Lucy movie as of now has never been released to the public but by stong requests from many fans it will be out soon!

I will keep updating this review as I find out more information about what is included with the set but this is a terrific value and not to be passed up even if the movie is not included with the complete series.. This is a terrific value and price!!

(UPDATE: The price of this set has now went up so I believe that if you were able to buy it at the $168.99 Amazon will match it via there policy but if you are just now buying it you will have to pay the new price unless it goes down before the release date which tends to happen a lot on Amazon with price changes so keep a look out and do price comparisons at dvdpricesearch website for this set to get the best deals. Also great news it has been confirmed that the lost I Love Lucy movie will be included with this set )",1185062400,119,3065,4.155143338954469

2897786,2,B000TGJ8B2,"Dear Manufacturer,
Please revise packaging. I completely understand the need to save money, but there are other ways.

At the time of writing this review this I Love Lucy Box Set was on sale for $35 and that is the only reason it gets 2 stars besides the fact that I Love Lucy. The first big case that comes with seasons 1-6 is TERRIBLE. The design is cheap and was broken upon arrival. Many discs are lightly scratched. Id return the set if I wasn't so sure a disc repair kit would make these disc viewable without skipping; unfortunately the disc repair kit is going to cost me the around the same as this box set did. I know some sacrifices had to be made for this set to be affordable, but this is seriously rediculous. The second case that comes with seasons 1-9 is great. They should have just split the first 6 season into two smaller cases like that one. None of the discs were lose in the small one and I assume this is due to a different design of the locking mechanism (The button that you push to take the DVD off of the plastic).",1521158400,,1042,4.236180904522613

2897802,4,B000TGJ8B2,"So pleased to find the complete series for such a remarkable price.  However there are some glitches.
One you pop a disc out of the plastic clip it does not always want to stay back in place.  Especially when you have a disc on top of the other
The first year once you selected play all it did play all.  Part way through the second year once you hit play all it will play the first episode and then stop  So have to go back to the main page select play all and fast forward over the first episode and start in again with the second episode.  It will play then.  One episode freezes frequently
If not for the glitches and the cheap case it would have garnered 5 stars
UPDATED - there are 2 boxes that hold the DVD's the last disc in the first box is horribly scratched so it freezes when playing and can't always skip over",1517788800,,822,4.10625

This was not done during shipping, this is broken prior to shipping and someone chose to ship it anyway.  I just missed the return window of course by a few days.  Not happy and hoping this review catches Amazons attention and they offer to replace it. I cant safely store these discs in this damaged case.",1517616000,,565,4.212962962962963

There are a lot of reviewers who'll say the packaging is horrible - but I actually found the cases and the box to be quite sturdy. The pictures most owners have posted do not do the set justice. However, my only complaint about the set is the art for each disc is just a basic grey design. I previously owned the earlier DVD seasons 1-3 sets that we released around 2004 or so and they were gorgeous! Each disc had its own artwork and it was a nice touch. That being said,  I would highly recommend this set to anyone. I also strongly suggest purchasing it from your local Walmart store instead of online, because it will save you a little exra money and you'll know exactly what your paying for.",1512172800,,807,4.2745098039215685

Since we got some others DVDs at the same time, by the time we opened this set and made the discovery that they also had the same problem even though they were brand new, we were outside the return window.

Lucy was ""just enough"" of a female ""schemer"" to make us ""laugh at ourselves.""

The DVDs are great but the majority of the DVDs are in this huge case that makes it feel too bulky. There is one DVD that for some reason can't fit onto its place so it sits loose in the case. You also have to be gentle taking out the discs because the things that keep them clipped into the disc case make it a bit difficult to take out where I was worried I might break a disc trying to take them out.

2898038,2,B000TGJ8B2,The plastic case holding the discs is severely cracked although the discs themselves appear to be fine. There is a cardboard box that holds both the plastic cases that was wrapped with plastic wrap so I had thought that no one had tampered with it however just because something is wrapped in plastic wrap doesn't mean that it is perfectly fine underneath. As I opened the cases to check if the discs were okay the plastic case that was already cracked started falling apart more. Furthermore you can see in the pictures that I have taken that the binding holding the discs is very loose. I don't know if anyone else has had problems with the plastic on the cases with this. I would not recommend this unless you want to have the discs and have some other case to put them in.,1482019200,,776,4.433566433566433

Lucy never gets old.  She's just plain funny.  And what I love about her shows is that they are clean and I can watch them with my young daughter who now really likes her as well.  This is a gift that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it.,1478304000,16,418,3.802325581395349

2898082,5,B000TGJ8B2,"When I visited Jamestown this summer, this set was for sale in the Lucy/Desi Museum for $100. Because I was so immersed in Lucy in the moment (I saw her birth home, family home, her grave site, the statues  Scary Lucy and New Lucy, all of the murals around town, DesiLu Studios and the Lucy/Desi Museum), I almost purchased it there but then did a quick Amazon search and saw it here for half the price (not that I can blame the museum  Lucy is keeping the town going and they need every penny they can get).

So like anyone else, I've seen Lucy all of my life, but this set has all of the episodes and as it turns out, I don't remember some of them as much as others. It's like seeing some of the episodes for the first time again. And they are all funny. No matter how many times you see these, they still crack you up. I just watched the Old Cow Hand episode this morning. Hilarious.

Anyway, this set consists of the complete series and includes uncut episodes so you may see something that you might not remember from typical broadcast syndication reruns (I am seeing a few things I don't recall in what I have watched so far). The discs are packaged in cases that are sized to fit with your other discs on shelves  no odd sizing. I was disappointed to learn that the extras disc (the I Love Lucy Movie, colorized episodes) is no longer offered as part of the package, but for the price, I can buy it separately. However, it was included in previous versions. This set does have some extras on each disc  bloopers and commercials and other little things that happened on set.

I will say that after reading the biography of Vivian Vance, I kind of appreciate her a lot more in the show. Lucy was a genius but so was Vivian, when you read up on her life.

A friend gave me the book, Meet the Mertzes, which I haven't read yet but it's ""on deck"" and I will review it once I read it.

I also recommend the documentary Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. produced  it provides a lot of background info and food for thought while watching the series.",1475798400,11,2045,4.260981912144703

  Well still having a ""I Love Lucy Marathon"" with my boy and he loves watching it with me to. the product it's nice and the art well done. I have pictures for the front and back just in case interested. was about to take pictures of the DVDS but there is a picture someone else took and its the same. (to much of them lol) took a break to write the review. Lucy is the queen of the slapstick comedy and will never fade. never mind the back drama about her family squabbles and Behind the drama of I Love Lucy (who cares I don't, I love the show) it takes the whole fun out it.

You can get CC, but in a different way. You'd need a regular DVD player (can't have Blu-Ray support or it won't work) and the subtitle on FROM the TV that you normally use to watch news. If you don't have a DVD player, you can easily find them for practically $20-$30 without breaking the bank! Hope this is clear enough for having trouble getting CC on.",1463788800,,423,4.2875

2898158,5,B000TGJ8B2,"DVD set owned four and a half years by date of  this review.
Certainly no true fan of Lucille Ball and 'I Love Lucy' needs to be convinced to get this set since you are likely a die hard fan who still watches the episodes on TV on various nostalgia type channels. With that said, I will confess I had this disk set on my wishlist for a period of eight months, as I initially balked at the over $200 price tag in 2011. Although I love Lucy, Ricky and the Mertzs enough to pay that much for owning all the episodes at home, I thought it was excessive at the time. So, for over an eight months period, I monitored the price as it fluctuated. Finally, in late November 2011, it was at $70.99 for literally like a minute and I jumped at the chance to purchase it right then and there.

Even though I was sure I had seen all the episodes on TV Land and Nick-at-Night over the years, I was pleasantly surprised that in the entire collection of the show, there were about 10-12 episodes I had never seen. It was wonderful to watch these newly discovered (for me) episodes and of course, laugh out loud and smile at the TV as I re-watched all the familiar classic ones.
The DVD set itself comes in a beautiful and thoughtfully packaged heart shape box, that is within a rectangular clear hard plastic shell. All CDs were present and in mint condition.

Of course, each episode has all the charm, laughs and love that we all know the series to have so I won't go into those details. However, I do want to point out how fantastic the picture quality is and how wonderful the special features and extras are. Each disk is filled with good features that further shed light into the making off, backstory and insider production tidbits and mistakes that you may not know of.
I love Lucy and I know you do too, so I don't recommend you wait for the price of this set to go down if price is the only reason you may not want to purchase it now or why you are reading reviews on it. If you do though, rest assured when you finally get it, it is a fantastic addition to any classic TV collection. It is an absolute gem and I continue to play the disks consistently throughout each year I've owned it.",1461110400,12,2181,4.237980769230769

Each episode is shown in its entirety, so you can see the parts that were cut in syndication.  I gave it a four-star rating for these reasons.  There is no program guide included.  If you don't recognize the episode by its title, you'll have to look it up online.  The special features are not much; stills and printed matter.  Of course there are no cast interviews since ""Little Ricky"" is the only surviving cast member.  Otherwise I highly recommend the DVD's.",1455494400,3,617,4.398230088495575
2898235,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I'm not going to waste time reviewing the show. We all know the show is timeless, acclaimed, beloved, and all that jazz. This is simply to comment on the newly repackaged set.

The previous release of the complete series of I Love Lucy contained the complete show on 33 DVDs, including a new pressing of the first season, reducing it to 6 discs from the 7 of the slimpack reissue and the 9 discs of the original release, while retaining all bonus features. (When CBS/Paramount repackaged the seasons with new comic-strip-styled artwork in standard-sized amaray cases with much smaller price tags, the 6-disc configuration was used for season 1, giving it its first standalone release.) It also contained a bonus DVD with the long lost movie, the colorized ""Lucy In Scotland"" episode, and many other rarities, plus an episode guide. However, the packaging took up shelf space and was quite frustrating to get the discs out. It was also quite expensive.

This new 2015 repackage ditches the guide, as well as the bonus DVD, which was issued separately a few years after the first set was released. It also presents a better package, albeit one that still needs improvement. This set takes up as much space as about five standard DVD cases and consists of a box with two cases inside - one contains seasons 1-5 on 25 discs while the other contains seasons 6-9 on 8 discs. This makes one case much larger than the other, and frankly, I think it'd have been better to divide seasons 1-5 into two cases as well. The holder inside the first case is not fixed inside but is pretty snug when the case is closed. The second case is a standard 8-disc double-thick amaray case. The episode lists are printed on the reverse side of the artwork, which can be seen through the clear cases.

The artwork for this release is classy and well done. I have to admit, I never cared for the artwork in the 2012 season set reissues, finding them way too kitschy for the show. This set looks much nicer and classier.

Finally, the price. At the MSRP of $80, it's great. But after tax, I paid $40. That's less than it would have cost me to buy the remaining five sets I needed at Amazon's current price of about $10 per season, as I had previously purchased the 2012 releases of the first two seasons. You can't argue with $40 for 131 episodes of I Love Lucy plus all 13 of the Comedy Hour specials. Especially with the wealth of bonus material (even without the bonus DVD), uncut restored episodes, great video and audio quality. One thing that would have truly sent this over the top would have been a bonus DVD with all of the colorized episodes to date, but for the content and price, I'm not complaining. This set was a great purchase. As a Hulu subscriber, I was happy to find the show on there, but disappointed to find some great episodes missing, not to mention the lack of the Comedy Hour specials. Now I have every episode whenever I want, with or without an internet connection.",1455408000,2,2965,4.557223264540338

2898243,4,B000TGJ8B2,"Great series and one of my all time favorites. At $37.99, it was a must have for this Lucy fan.  The packaging of the DVD's leaves a lot to be desired, in regards to the stability and safe storage of the discs.  Once I opened up the package, two of the DVD's had come loose from their flimsy holder, causing the discs to incur significant scratching. The center spindle tab that is supposed to secure the DVD is cheaply made, and does not do a consistent job of properly seating the disc so that it does not move around or come loose. I had to order a replacement set from Amazon. I am glad that Amazon has such great customer service.

For those of you who have bought this great show or are thinking about it, take heed as to the DVD packaging. I highly suggest you purchase the following 10 disc DVD holder at the following Amazon link, (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C2FN95O?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00) even if you haven't had any problems. I have had to use the Maxtek 10 disc DVD holders for the Seinfeld and King of Queens series as well. I rather spend $15.00 for the better discs holder, than damage the ""I Love Lucy"" set from trying to watch and store the series in its original packaging.",1454803200,6,1229,4.680555555555555

2898260,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I watched the show when I was a kid when rerun. Never got the chance to buy it because of the price. I do like the slim case version that I have it in I Dream of Jeannie and Brady Bunch. But of course after some time now, it's out of stock unless you buy used but still expensive. For the latest version, you pay less than the price compare to the older version, I brought it somewhere else for even less. But when I receive it and compare to the buyer that upload the pictures, mine have 3 cases in the boxset instead of 2. First box (season 1-2), second box (season 3-4), and last box (season 5-9). There is 1-2 discs that are in sleeve in 2 of the box. You just never get bored with it... I watched the series twice after I received it (2 weeks). Finally I can laugh when watching a series. Lucille and Desi are the legendary couple.

Another thing about the 33 disc boxset, it does not included the colorized christmas that have 3 color episodes and I Love Lucy movie which both of them can be buy it individually. Also it does not included original footage of some of the episodes that you can see in youtube which I am disappointed because screen time, scenes are cut off when on aired, only the audience could see it. Of course, there won't be any of these footage be available for future version but I hope there will be one, I really want to see the full show of each episodes.

Lucy and Desi are the legendary couple. They are the best. Always love them.",1453248000,,1464,4.1879432624113475

2898271,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This is a complete box set well worth buying for any Lucy fan! And at such a great budget price too! What I mainly want to focus on however is the Closed Captioning on this set. At this time, it is NOT listed in the detail page whether or not this new 2015 release has CC, and I can conform that it indeed does! I was very confused myself before ordering it. (Got from Walmart)
I have tested the discs and all the episodes here and even the Special Features are Closed Captioned. If you rely on CC, you will be very happy with this set! Studios usually list if a dvd is CC on the back of the box. However, the studio weirdly felt the need to place this information for this set on the BOTTOM of the box! So the casual viewer picking it up and flipping to the back to look will think there's no CC!
But you have to literally look underneath the box on the bottom to read all the disc details, which is really a head scratcher! I have included pics so you can see for yourself. But have no fear....This great new 2015 I love Lucy Complete series is fully Closed Captioned for those like myself who rely on them! Enjoy! :)",1448668800,10,1119,4.114155251141552

2898283,4,B000TGJ8B2,"Pros:
1. The price - Even if this set was sold at its SRP (suggested retail price) of $80, it would be a steal, but the fact that it's being sold (as I write this) for around $45 is insane! That's less than $1.50 per disc. It's an amazing deal for the complete series.
2. Uncut episodes - OK, this is a pro for any of the DVD releases, but it's important to list this here anyway. TV networks today butcher episodes - especially classic shows - to make room for more and more commercials. These are uncut and in some cases, contain over 3 minutes of footage per episode not shown in syndication repeats.
3. Space saving - This set is significantly smaller than the previous release. It's not as elaborate, but it will fit on your shelf with the rest of your DVDs and it won't take up too much space. It's a little bit wider than 5 standard DVD cases.
4. The discs are packaged better - There are issues with the way the discs are packaged (see below) - BUT, they are packaged a lot better than the previous set, which had them loose in cardboard sleeve books. This set is a definite improvement.

Cons:
1. The missing disc(s) - Unlike the original complete series set, this one doesn't contain the exclusive bonus disc with the colorized Lucy Goes to Scotland episode or the I Love Lucy movie (along with several other special features). Fortunately though, you can buy that disc by itself. Just search for I Love Lucy: The Movie and Other Great Rarities. This set also doesn't contain the special Colorized Christmas disc that was released two years ago (which you can also buy by itself). True, that particular release was never included with the original complete series set, but it would have been a nice addition with this set, even though it's a bit out of date already, not having three of the six episodes (so far?) that have been colorized by CBS - Job Switching (the chocolate factory episode, aired in 2014) and Lucy and Superman and L.A. at Last (aired in 2015).
2. The packaging - As you can see from the pictures I've posted of the set, the packaging is very cheap and prone to issues. Full disclosure: I didn't buy mine from Amazon; I purchased mine at Walmart, in store, but that doesn't mean you won't encounter similar issues from other retailers including Amazon. If you do, though, it won't be their fault. The box itself (which was torn a bit for me, I don't know why) that houses the disc cases appears to be a little too big for the cases. I can imagine some dents could become an issue for some people, especially on the side where the cases come out. There is almost a quarter of an inch of wiggle room in there, which could also lead to cracks in the disc cases themselves (as mine was, on both the spine and the side that opens). The discs come in two cases, one larger (and wider) than the other, which makes them look a bit odd together. There are 25 discs in the larger case and 8 in the smaller one. As you can see with the larger case, the disc holders themselves aren't attached to the case. Mine was already broken on one of the hinges. It makes it a little awkward going through the discs when the holder isn't firmly in place, too. The discs overlap in the larger case as well unlike in the smaller case (which is more in the style of those 6-disc, clear amaray cases that have become so popular now, for good reason) leaving the discs in the larger case prone to scratches (several of mine had small scratches). The hubs in the larger case were very flimsy as well, only containing two ""prongs"" on each side to hold the discs in place, which leaves the discs moving around more than they would on a normal hub, making the possibility for scratches even higher. One of my discs was loose inside because one of the prongs broke. There were also a couple discs that had a speck or two of glue or something on the play side of them. I don't know where it came from, but luckily it was very easy to rub off and may have only been an issue with my set in particular, something that would be found rarely if at all. But, having said all of that, at the end of the day, this set is very, very cheap - unbelieveably cheap - and you can't complain too much.
3. The missing ""The Celebrity Next Door"" scene - OK, so, the set isn't COMPLETELY uncut. There is one instance where a scene is missing - the scene in the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour with Tallulah Bankhead where she first mentions her strawberry allergy to Lucy while at dinner. This wasn't included in any of the other releases either. How it ended up on the cutting room floor from the original masters, I have no idea. It's only a brief moment that is missing, though, certainly not enough of an issue where it would make this set not worth getting.
4. No episode guide/booklet - The original complete series set came with a nice episode guide/booklet, but this only has the episode titles listed on the inside of the cases and on the discs themselves. Anyone who's a huge I Love Lucy fan will know the episodes by their titles, but a more casual fan - you know, one who wouldn't recognize an episode called Job Switching as the chocolate factory episode - may have a hard time finding a particular episode.

There are the pros and cons to help you decide whether to get this new set or not. I recommend it a great deal, even with the (possible) issues. It's worth the money and any I Love Lucy fan will love this.

If you have any questions about the set, post them in the comments and I'll try to answer them for you.",1446595200,442,5501,4.34402332361516

The price on this set was great since I waited for it to come down as they always do.  In addition, they are complete and in order rather than the cut up versions at random that you often see on TV now.  My teenage niece watched them for the first time wtih me from this collection and she loved them.  Some comedy holds up no matter how many years later and there are 3 main ones: The Andy Griffith Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show and this one.

2898339,5,B000TGJ8B2,"First off, who doesn't Lucille Ball?! She was a legend, and so far ahead of her time! I grew up watching these classic shows, and I Love Lucy is just one of those shows that never gets tiring. No matter how many times I have seen an episode, I always laugh and discover something that I didn't before. Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz were truly a love story, and to be blunt, gave up their marriage in real life, to make this glorious classic show!  As far as the packaging on this complete series boxset, I would NOT recommend buying this complete series set, because the cardboard holders that hold the discs are cheaply made, and do not protect the disks. If you want your set to last for a very long time, I do recommend doing like I did, and buying the ""Individual"" season sets, instead of this set! If you do buy this set, you're disks will not last for very long, and eventually won't play at all because of being scratched up. So, invest a little more and buy the individual sets Seasons 1-6, and the Lucy-Desi comedy hour Seasons 7-9, and sit back and enjoy classic television at it's finest!! Again, AVOID this complete series set, and buy the seasons individually for secure and better packaging of the disks. Enjoy!",1429315200,2,1221,4.450892857142857

Not only do you have to slide the entire DVD set out of a plastic container but when you open it the DVDs are hidden in between jackets labeled by season with the appropriate disc sitting in front of the appropriately labeled jacked.

Cannot remove the labeled jackets. Only the DVDs. That makes for a very frustrating day if you wanna grab a particular episode but have to flip through endless jackets which can hardly be read due to their positioning in the package and the fact that the jackets cannot be physically removed so you can clearly read the season/episodes that you want. Fancy, nastalgic, and artistic packaging is great. Just don't make it too complicated to access the material.",1423785600,7,791,4.690647482014389

Recreted and original Philip Morris ads are good, and add to the authenticity.  Colorized show at the end is nice.  Sadly, CBS didn't DO color untill I.L.L was long since cancelled.

Nice bonus:  Several 'My Favorite Husband' RADIO shows added at the ends of the DVD's.  These starred Lucy and Richard Denning.  As 'Liz and George Cugat (later Cooper), two people who live together, and LOVE IT'.  Many of the plotlines were reused in the TV series.  These were not available to collectors until this release.

I appreciate that Amazon was able to take this dvd's back for a full refund.  The only reason for not liking this is that the dvd's comes in a box set and  the dvd movies falls out really easy.  It pretty flimsy box set.  It's better to buy the individual series rather than the whole series.

It was fun to watch these great classics again.  There are several episodes that will always remain a TV classic, such as when Lucy and Ethel worked in the Chocolate Shop, when Lucy caught her noise on fire, etc.

The set comes in a fancy-looking box that's hard to open and has too many parts. I actually cut my finger opening the packaging. The case that looks like a standard DVD case with binder-type disc storage should be the UNIVERSAL packaging type because it's the most practical from an engineering standpoint. It consumes the least amount of space on a shelf and makes the discs easy to get at. This box has the discs in cardboard sleeves which should NEVER be done because it scratches the discs.

2898493,5,B000TGJ8B2,"By now, most everyone is familiar with this classic series and can appreciate the work of talented actress/comedienne Lucille Ball.  But there was more to ""I Love Lucy"" than just Lucy.  Viewers liked watching her hair-brained antics but they also enjoyed seeing the friendship that was Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel.  The iconic picture of the four of them smiling happily in a convertible with Ricky driving, Lucy alongside and the Mertzes in the back seat says it all and gives me a warm feeling every time I look at it.  We as viewers enjoy watching people relate to their friends and co-workers (think ""The Dick Dyke Show"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""The Honeymooners"", ""Seinfeld"", ""Friends"", etc.).  Behind the scenes, Lucy and Desi Arnaz (Ricky) were in control of the production. Desi himself is credited with championing the now standard ""three camera"" filming process.  The two of them also are responsible for helping to create the ""rerun"" when they realized that if you filmed these shows they could be replayed over and over.  That's also the reason this DVD is even possible.",1407801600,,1089,4.918032786885246

2898507,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I have been DVR'n this show for a long time, but I have not really gotten to watch the entire series, nor in the correct aired order. So I finally bought this while it was on a GREAT sale. I'm not too particularly happy with it's packaging. The picture of the item doesn't show that there is actually a rectangle clear hard plastic box, if you look at the picture, the ""people"" in the box set are actually printed on the Plastic part, not the cardboard box itself. I just think it's odd, and I don't like that design. I will say I didn't like how the disks where packaged, all laid out in two rows, luckily each season grants it's own color on the DVD itself. But here is what I did, I simply took a blank CD paper sleeve and put it in the front, that way the last DVD I watched I simply put in that sleeve, keeping my watching in order. In other complete sets, I was always able to put the current watched DVD in the front as most sets have the DVD's in it's own case. So, I fixed my problem by using a cheap paper CD sleeve. Other than that, how can you go wrong with the actual show, the invention of the three camera shot, and her well respected comic approach, something that so many actors and actress' aspire to. I can't give it less than 5 stars due to the rather sub-par packaging design as this is such a great show, so it' balances out just fine for a 5 star rating...",1407542400,,1379,4.092250922509225

2898552,4,B000TGJ8B2,"The images are beautiful, evidently they used the restored films that Nick At Nite began broadcasting about twenty years ago. Segments that were deleted to shorten running time and make more space for commercials are restored, to where I occasionally view a scene or segment that I don't ever recall having seen before. Another bonus is the inclusion of three seasons of the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"", thirteen one-hour shows that followed the ""I Love Lucy"" format, which aired 1957-1960.

Why I didn't rate this product five stars:

1. No English subtitles. Whether one is showing an episode to elderly parents in their 80s, or to friends visiting from abroad who speak English as a second language, it's helpful to be able to turn on English subtitles when needed. This set has Spanish subtitles, but no English. My guess is they acquired the rights to previously-rendered Spanish subtitles on the cheap, but that it cost too much to produce English subtitles (which certainly exist if the series was presented on Nick At NIte in the Close Caption era).

2. Poor labeling of product. The set is housed in a space saver box, with innovative ""Lucy heart"" lid. Two accordion-style cardboard disk holders house the disks. It goes downhill from there. There is a separate episode guide booklet, but no episodes printed on the disks themselves. Each season is color-coded, so that Season 1 disks are pink, Season 2 are gold, Season 3 are blue, etc. Each disk has the season printed at the top in very small fonts (it's easier to match colors than read the text on the disk) and then the disk number appears farther down in larger fonts. No episodes listed on the disks or on the cardboard partitions between each disk. The season and disk number are printed very prominently on each partition, and there would easily have been room to list episodes with a little forethought. The result is that you have to hunt for a specific episode, unless you have the episode booklet in one hand as you scroll through the partitions/disks looking for the desired episode. For example, ""Job Switching"" (aka Chocolate Factory) was the first episode of Season Two, which I knew, so it's easy to find that episode. But if you are looking for say the episode in which Lucy learns she is pregnant, or the episode in which Little Ricky is born, you have to flip through each Season Two disk in succession and search the disk menu for the episodes you want, or search the booklet looking for the right disk number and then locate the correct disk. How much would it have cost to have added the episodes either to the disk label itself, or at least to the cardboard partition which already lists season # and disk #? Even lower-end Lucy Show and Here's Lucy disks list the episodes either on the disk or on the disk case. I don't think these are unreasonable amenities to expect in a $100 boxed set.

The picture quality is incredible as it was filmed to be shown and not a live performance captured on Kine scope.

How can such a thing as this be lacking for this most wonderful show! Second, the packaging is really poorly made and arranged. The outer box is cute but not very functional to access the DVDs. In fact, the first box I received was actually separated with a broken heart. No one likes a broken heart. (Amazon quickly rectified this by replacing my original order.) Also the DVDs are arranged in an accordion style holder which does not stand well when trying to retrieve a DVD; It wants to run away like a Slinky.

Anyway, the good, er, really good is I Love Lucy is a great show and will always be a great show to watch forever. I also like having the pre-show credits showing the actual filming along with many other production extras. I am getting many hours of enjoyment and much more.

If you're a Lucy fan (you have to be, don't you?), this is a great set to have with all the shows in one collection along with many extras and information about the show.",1400284800,2,1144,4.4170616113744074

This complete series set is fantastic. Before each episode, information at the bottom of the screen indicates when the episode initially aired. There is also the ""Lost Pilot"" episode, as well as a fully colorized episode. The whole set comes in a cool case. I feel as though getting the whole series in one go is the preferred way, as it takes up less space as opposed to getting each season individually.

Although I did not take advantage of this great offer since I had already purchased every single season separately, but for someone who is contemplating whether to buy it or not, it's a no brainer, if you love this series, you can't beat this offer!

My favorite episodes are the ones where Lucy, Ricky along with their best friends Fred and Ethel go to California and all the crazy trouble that only zany Lucy can get into in trying to meet some of the big stars such as John Wayne and Bob Hope, just to name a couple; her adventures are just histerical!  I also love the episodes where they go to Europe including Italy, France and England,  I particularly like the episode where Lucy meets the famous French actor Charles Boyer. That episode is just too funny and it makes me laugh every single time! The whole cast of ""I Love Lucy"" is superb and the writing is unbeatable.

The outer clear plastic boxing is removable; the Heart Top pulls up to expose all of the discs and the printed episode guide, When you remove the two packets of discs (seasons 1-3 and seasons 4-9) the packet expands and each disc has its own protected sleeve. The sleeves for the seasons are color coded as well making a visual attraction that reminded my wife of an old juke-box.
The discs are extremely crisp and clear on the screen. The menu offers only Spanish subtitles, but with the cc set to on on my television there were  English subtitles on the screen.  I have watched only the first disc so far starting with the lost pilot episode, and have realized just how much was cut from the syndicated shows I grew up with.

Lucy & Desi made a great onscreen couple-despite their real life marriage was less than Ideal-but on screen there can be no argument that they had great chemistry. The follow up shows that follows ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" Despite being popular do not hold a candle to ""I Love Lucy"" perhaps because Lucy and Desi were not working together anymore-they were no longer married.

However Lucy I think was able to teach a thing or two to even the best Male comics about what makes great Comedy-Just expose them to a few eps of ""I love Lucy"" I think they can learn a great deal.",1398556800,3,932,4.381502890173411

I would rather that the studio had spent an extra $3-5/set wholesale, (thus $7-10 cost to us), in order to give the 34 discs the same kind of higher-quality casing that the series M*A*S*H* comes in. A series this funny not only deserves it, it demands it! I believe that Lucille Ball would be most unhappy to see the best of her life's work packaged as poorly as this set is. Fortunately, I have a solution for you.
You should pick up a 36-disc holder along with this order. As of this writing, you can get one for $10.73 here on Amazon, or as little as $8.15 from one of Amazon's dealers. That way, you'll have room for the 34 DVDs and the most-excellently written booklet about ""I Love Lucy"" that comes with the set.
IF, heaven forbid, you're unfamiliar with this show, look up ""I Love Lucy"", the factory episode on YouTube. (Season 2, Episode 4 on this boxed set). It so greatly illustrates the sheer perfect genius of this program's scriptwriters as well as the acting and brilliant comic timing amongst Lucy (Lucille Ball), Ricky (Desi Arnaz), Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance), and the show's resident curmudgeon, Fred Mertz, (William Frawley). Fact: Ricky and Lucy are married in real life, and, though the neighbor-couple characters, Fred and Ethel are not, you'd never know that based on their performances.
To be sure, some scripts have the ""boys"" say things to the ""girls"" that are groan-worthy sexism by today's standards, and Lucy regularly mocks her husband's triple-thick Cuban accent in ways that would have Latino groups marching in the streets to protest. Still, ""I Love Lucy"" is quite clearly ahead for its time, by giving us an early peek at ""women's' lib"", if you will.
That is, if Lucy and Ethyl tangle with Ricky and Fred, you may rest assured that the ladies will outwit the fellows every single time. At the end of the ""Factory"" episode, for example, Lucy and Ethel win the argument with Ricky and Fred, fairly and squarely. What Ricky and Fred do by way of apology, though, must be seen to be believed... Razor-sharp comedy at its best, all 194 episodes, and more!

When you're young, you don't get the adult humor that is a part of these shows.  You watch them because they are comforting to you.  By the time the show is done, the calamity that has happened is over and everything has gone back to a comfortable place, and its time for supper.  Now, years later, I am watching with adult eyes and I get it...finally.  I laugh alot now, at all my favorite shows because they are really funny.  And its not raunchy either.

The only problem I have with it is that the heart-box thing it came in isn't very sturdy. It's made of styrofoam with the hearts (made of cardboard) glued on to the end. One of the hearts broke off almost immediately after opening it. This really doesn't effect the quality of the DVDs and in the end it took about 5 minutes to fix the box.

Another one that is very good is when they get a job in the chocolate factory and can not keep up with the chocolate coming down the belt.

2898749,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This is the complete run of all I Love Lucy episodes.  For those of you who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s who watched this show when it was new, or for those of us who were born later and watched this show on daytime television or in the evenings on Nick at Nite, you won't have to wait for it to come on TV anymore, nor will you have to set up a DVR recording.

Don't be put off by the cover, these shows are in their original black and white broadcast versions.  As far as I can tell, they have been remastered, so the gritty graininess that sometimes came through in the original broadcast recordings is gone.  Audio quality is good.  The menus are easy to navigate.

The only complaint that I have regarding this product is the size of the packaging.  All of the discs come in two small sleeved envelopes, but the packaging is easily over a foot wide and 10 inches tall.  Once you unpackage the discs, there is a lot of waste material to either store or throw away.  Overall, that minor inconvenience doesn't affect my 5-star rating of this product.

It's not expensive packaging; and the cardboard sleeves are hard on the discs...but....one can just pick up some protective sleeves and transfer the discs for safer keeping. On the other hand, it's well known that even surface scratches usually don't affect the playing or picture quality of a DVD or CD.

  I would not have bought this if I knew these statements were on the box.  I would've waited for simpler packaging, with the whole show.  $80.99 (XII/XI/MMXIII) down the drain.
  The packaging IS nice to look at, but you may not want to go through this on a regular basis.  You now need a box the same size of another show to take up the room this one makes available on your digital video disc shelf, if you have your others stored in standard cases, vertically.
  It's ""I Love Lucy"".  You don't need to SELL it.  A plain white cover with ""I Love Lucy"" embossed on it would do just fine.  Ask a Beatle.
  Also, the heart is almost unglued from the styrofoam.  If there's anything wrong with any of the discs of my favorite show, I'll be back.

Back in the 50's, they didn't have CGI to create stunning visual effects, and they didn't have non-stop high-energy action scenes of explosions and constant camera angle changes.  So guess what they had to do?  They had to have a good and interesting storyline!  That's why my wife and daughter can sit and watch 4 to 5 straight hours of Lucy for 2 to 3 days at a time!

I have had this set for a long time and a lot of the DVDs were starting to get scratched and I just wanted a new set! This one looks perfect except the tope of the box is damaged and falling apart. That doesn't matter because I'm just using the old one. I hope they aren't usually damaged when sent out. :) But other than that they're perfect!,1387065600,,408,4.049382716049383
2898836,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This series is, of course, an absolute classic. For anyone who has seen them the few words in my title instantly bring to mind a few of the episodes which have become legend. This set, of course, has all of them as well as all the other brilliant comedy of Lucille Ball and company. We bought this set for my kids and my daughter (who is 11) loves them and I think is now close to watching them all. Actually, there are 3 generations of Lucy fans in our family and my daughter and mother share this love. I had not seen them for years and I've enjoyed seeing many episodes as well. Lucy was truly innovative - and her inspiring comedy has been copied but never duplicated.

The packaging is a bit ""unique"" to get the discs into a heart shaped box (that would be a good name for a song!) - and we have had a couple times when the discs have dumped out after being knocked over by a dog's tail, but the packaging is not important to me.

Overall highly recommended - anyone who loves classic TV really should own this set.",1386460800,2,1020,4.198979591836735

2898840,5,B000TGJ8B2,"The digital image of these shows is impeccable.  Each episode looks crisper than ever, and after having seen them on TV as reruns for so long (with the inevitable cuts to allow for commercials), it is wonderful to see them in their entirety and in all their glory.

I was also amazed to find out that the subtitles (the captions in Spanish) are actually wonderful. They were done in educated Cuban Spanish, which is a great reflection on the Spanish that Desi Arnaz spoke on the show.  It is wonderful to listen to the show in English and put the Spanish captioning on.

This collection is great on every level.",1385942400,2,611,4.527272727272727
2898841,4,B000TGJ8B2,"Admittedly, I have not actually tried any of the discs yet, so this rating is strictly on the packaging design of the product and the fact that Lucy makes me very happy.  I grew up watching syndicated episodes of this show in the summer time a couple hours after The Price is Right and just a couple hours before afternoon cartoons (you guessed it, we did not have cable).

So about the packaging: What you see in the picture is what it looks like, but you have to imagine the photos of Lucy on a clear plastic box that goes outside the cardboard heart shaped box that the actual discs are in.  It's really pretty, but I sorta wish the photos weren't on the clear plastic because now I feel obligated to keep the plastic, even though it makes it much more cumbersome to get the actual box set out of the plastic and then back into it again later.  Once you've gotten the set out of the plastic, the actual cardboard box is pretty neat.  The heart itself is a part of the lid, and when you lift it off, the rectangular part of the box has a front opening that makes it easier to grab the booklet listing the episodes.  The actual discs are divided between two holders that resemble a sort of rounded flip book/file folder... Overall, very hard for me to describe, but undoubtedly a lot of creativity went into the design of this box set.  It's very clearly not a run of the mill, ""Here's a box, and here are all the discs that come with it..."" so I give it 4 stars because the packaging makes me as happy as my actual memories of the show.",1385769600,,1538,4.2465753424657535

Was afraid the many discs would be confusing but the production manufacturer's have made a comprehensible item by using a menu manual with comprehensive episode titles and descriptions on every season and bonus feature, plus the disc packaging is very useful and condensed in a conveniant paper divider that clearly marks each disc by season and disc number.

As a preteen child I would watch I Love Lucy reruns and always loved them and more recently when I was in the hospital this year, I watched an I Love Lucy episode on cable and it still made me laugh this many years later.  Now, I pop in an episode and it is the best 20 minutes worth of ""therapy"" -- better than meditation or anything to put me in a great mood after a stressful time.  As a 60 year old adult, I can see how the roles of women have changed so much from when the show was first aired around 1952 -- I have no problem with this, but it might seem problematic to younger viewers.  As an added bonus I have even found that I can even get my dementia mom to watch certain episodes that have more visuals and less dialogue and have seen her watch and even laugh which is incredibly rare -- that alone might have been worth it, but I love them too.",1372636800,3,1044,4.102941176470588
2898856,5,B000TGJ8B2,This was bought as a gift for my wife and we both love it. This is one of the absolute best packaged series sets I have seen. There are lots of other sets for shows you can buy that come in shameful packaging. This set comes in a heavy duty box with lots of art work and an outer hard plastic box to keep it in for extra protection. Inside you will find a full color and detailed book that tells all about the I Love Lucy show and short descriptions of each episode with lots of pictures. The cover is a hard cardboard plastic coated heart shaped top. Inside there are two very well made DVD holders set up like mini rolodex to make it easy to flip thru and find the Season and Disc you want to play. Best made set of DVDs I have seen. As far as quality of the audio / video - 100% perfect and could not be better. I Love Lucy show has always been one of the highest quality produced and filmed shows of all time tv series history so that helps I am sure. The quality and sound are 2nd to none and that is cause the show was done at Desilu Studios where almost every great tv series of the 1960s and 70s were made. The big plus is you can save almost 50% buying thru amazon as opposed to a store..... that is why I bought here. Do not hesitate if you are wanting this set and get it here.,1372291200,5,1288,3.9386973180076628

So I now have to open the second set, hope the same DVD's are not damaged, make one complete set and I've spent $30 more making one set from two than they are being sold for at the moment.  I am highly disappointed, and thats an understatement, in the customer service.  I understand if I had damaged the DVD's or it was done in my care.

Although this series certainly shows the limits of the woman's role in the early 50's it also shows how absolutely FUNNY Lucy could be.  An all-out comedic genius, she never hesitated to do whatever it would take to make people laugh.  Who can forget Lucy's demand for the headdress that is too heavy for her to balance on her head?  Who can forget Lucy and the Italian grape stomper?  Or VitaMetaVegaMix?  Or the chocolate production line?",1359158400,,496,4.776470588235294

2898904,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Few can argue that ""I Love Lucy"" will always remain a television classic which is like a fine wine: it gets better with age. The series was a certified hit when originally broadcast on CBS in the 1950's where it was the #1 show in the nation for many seasons, it went off the  air while still a smash Nielsen hit, went on to enjoy more success as a CBS daytime show and since the 1960's has been in constant syndication around the globe and is seen every day somewhere in the world.

 Featuring the series' full 181 episodes (which include the lost pilot and colored Christmas show), the ""I Love Lucy-Complete Series"" set is a must-have of fans of classic comedy and Lucille Ball. The shows themselves look beautiful, the set features a ton of bonus features including rare opening titles, promos and the 13 episode series called ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" that aired after ""I Love Lucy"" went off the air. And the price for this set is amazingly cheap when compared to the individual box set costs. Also included is an informative booklet of neat info on the series and its stars.

 As far as box sets go this ranks right up there with the rare limited edition set of ""Dark Shadows-The Complete Original Series"".",1358985600,,1213,4.545871559633028
2898905,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I am on my fourth disc, and I still have over 170 more episodes to go. The quality, like many of these releases, is great. If you divide the cost of the entire series by the cost, each episode costs about the same as a postage stamp. In addition, like many comedies, you can watch the same episodes over and over. Even though you know what's happening next, it still will have one laughing. The same as other series I have purchased through Amazon, such as Abbott and Costello's movies and TV series, Car 54, Sgt. Bilko, The Three Stooges, and Amos and Andy. You can never go wrong with any classic comedy series, because they're never outdated, but just old fashion fun, which today's generation, unfortunately, might have lost due to technology.",1358985600,,747,4.62406015037594

2898912,5,B000TGJ8B2,"My Husband and I are so happy to say, as huge I Love Lucy fan ourselves, that this series has been a wonderful addition to our family series collections. More so then all of the others combined and we do own a fair few.

Over the Christmas Holiday's many of our grandchildren paid us a visit, Their ages ranging from 3 to 16. The I Love Lucy Show played in the DVD player for the entire 4 days time, non stop. I offered, many times, to change the DVD's to other movie selections, but I was met with the most Fastenating reactions. My 16 year old grandson said, ""oh No Grandma, These guys are so funny!"" My 5 year old grandson said, ""Grandma, That lady makes funny faces!""

My 12 year old granddaughter refused to watch anything else and commented that she really likes the funny predicament Lucy gets up to. Even our 3 year old granddaughter will pause in front of the television when she hears the laughter from their studio audience.

While three of our grandson's ages 9, 11, and 14, were engrossed in the antics of Lucy, I made mention that we have many other DVD's if that show gets tiring. Their reaction was unanimous, and I was met with a vibrant, ""No Thanks, this is a very funny show."" One of the boys even mentioned that it would be great if we were to get more of these black and white shows.

We stood in the doorway and watched each of them as they watched and they were actually commenting to each other about the sceens with which Lucy and Ethel were conspiring against Ricky to get on Ricky's show and laughing. I found their reactions to be absolutely astonishing, due to the fact that these are Video game buffs, with games and graphics that are far more outstanding (and in many ways disturbing) then what they are presently watching. The I Love Lucy shows are in Black and White and there is no cursing or blood and guts violence (the things which these boys are usually engrossed in)

We, as grandparents, are so grateful that there are things from our childhood that can still reach the hearts of our grandchildren.

Since then we have purchased many other DVD sets. My Favorite Martian, Andy Griffith, Mr. Ed, The Munster's, Adam's Family and many more.

FAMILY FUN FOR ALL AGES!

We hope this review helps. Thanks for reading.",1358467200,,2251,4.45985401459854

2898916,4,B000TGJ8B2,"I really, really love I Love Lucy so it kind of pains me to give this only four stars, but it's just not as good as it could be. It's awesome to have every single episode all in one package, and I like that each episode is prefaced with a brief screen informing the viewer of the original air date. There are also occasional interspersed colorized scenes that appear between episodes, which I really like seeing. As far as the content goes, this is a great item.

My one (big) complaint regards the packaging. I really dislike it. While the box is rather cute (it's a blue half box with a lid that has a red heart and ""I Love Lucy"" in white lettering) it's not very practical. Mine came broken - the back half of the heart was ripped off and it was only styrofoam underneath, making it rather difficult to glue back on satisfactorily. Also, the actual ""cases"" that hold the discs are a joke. They are nothing more than an open, accordion-like case that is slightly larger than the DVDs themselves. I have spilled the discs out multiple times just trying to remove the case from the box. Added to that is the fact that there is no information regarding the content of the discs. You have to pull out the leaflet that comes with it and match the proper disc to find out which episodes are on it. I have known other series that ""label"" their discs this way, so I guess that's rather normal, but I do find it annoying. I could really live with it, though, if only the packaging were sturdier and held the discs more securely.

All in all a great deal and cheaper than buying the seasons individually, though I'd almost suggest doing that because you know your DVDs will be better protected and it will be easier to figure out which one you want to put in to watch certain episodes. As long as my discs don't fall out too much and get scratched, I know I will be happy with this purchase for years to come. It's just a shame to see such a good series in such bad packaging.",1358035200,2,1968,4.30188679245283
2898917,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I bought it since it was a great price and it finally went down in price.  It was easier to buy it this way rather than buy each season.  Only downside, although the box is nice, it is a little difficult to put back together in the box.",1358035200,,236,3.8958333333333335

Now that I am older, she is definitely a woman who was worth idolizing. When I saw this set, I had to have it. However, I didn't want to pay the hefty price tag that follows. It's been on my wish list for a while now and I saw this on Groupon for an instant deal a few weeks ago for $70. Obviously, I bought it! I have not been disappointed. The quality is good and there is lots of extra footage. The only thing that looks rather bad is the opening credits; they look like an old VCR was playing them. The actual show however is very nice quality and this set comes with lots of little extras. There's too much to list but it was worth the price. Honestly, if I would of known there was this much to it, I probably would of skipped groupon and paid the larger price from Amazon. Overall, if you're a fan, you'll be happy with this purchase.",1339459200,,987,4.0152284263959395

2898960,5,B000TGJ8B2,This is the best series of I Love Lucy it brings back memories on just how funny she was. Some I haven't even seen before its the best buy.,1337126400,,139,3.8275862068965516
2898961,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I Love Lucy was my favorite TV show when I was 14 years old. That was when we first got cable! And I still love it today. Then I started watching The Lucy Show. Unfortunately, that was on at 2am, so I never saw much of it. I am so glad that The Lucy Show - not to mention Here's Lucy and various Lucille Ball specials - are now almost finished being released on DVD as well! I Love Lucy will always be my favorite of the 3 series. The Lucy Show was aimed more at a younger audience, I think. Here's Lucy brought it back up a notch. But I Love Lucy is definitely the classiest! Lucille Ball paired with Vivian Vance gives I Love Lucy something the other 2 shows just couldn't imitate. Lucy and Ethel. What a pair. Everyone should have a friend like that! And of course Lucille Ball with Desi Arnaz. Lucy occasionally got a potential boyfriend on the other 2 shows, but he was always gone by the next episode! The romance, the two of them together, the two couples either fighting or scheming together... great comedy! And then of course there was William Frawley. He was a great foil. I always liked him better than Gale Gordon. Mr. Mooney/Harry could be so mean! Fred could be gruff, but his heart of gold always shined through.

I don't own this actual item. I bought the individual seasons as they came out and wanted to review the series as a whole. It's just as well. I notice that, like most complete series, a lot of buyers think the design of the big box is poor for storing discs safely and conveniently. And, of course,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Movie-and-Other-Great-Rarities/dp/B00363WGIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy: The Movie and Other Great Rarities</a>&nbsp;has been released on its own since then. And how awesome that ""Lucy Goes to Scotland,"" one of my favorite episodes, is the episode they chose to colorize as a special feature on that disc! So cool!

Here are some of my favorite episodes:
""Lucy Goes to Scotland,"" of course: Lucy dreams she is going to be eaten by a 2-headed Fred and Ethel dragon
Pretty much all the Europe episodes, really...
""Lucy and Bob Hope,"": I've seen their 4 movies together, so it's always fun to watch them interact
""The Operetta,"": Vivian Vance really shines in this one; I just wish her song was longer
""Ricky Minds the Baby,"": Ricky tells Little Red Riding Hood in Spanish!
""Home Movies,"": Lucy and Ethel are cowboys... backwards
""The Great Train Robbery,"": just ridiculous!
""Lucy Meets Tallulah Bankhead,"": I know that's a comedy hour, but oh well
""Bull Fight Dance,"": for once, the bull is full of Lucy!
""Lucy Thinks Ricky is Trying to Murder Her,"": first episode filmed, a little uneven and also implausible, but very funny
I could totally go on!

Out of the 3 ""big ones""... that is, ""chocolate factory,"" ""grape stomping,"" and ""vitameatavegamin,"" I would go with ""chocolate factory."" Actually called ""Job Switching,"" it features great scenes of Ricky and Fred messing up the kitchen with rice in addition to Lucy and Ethel messing up with the conveyor belt. Great episode. Amazing series. Will always be one of my top favorites!",1336694400,,3160,4.826568265682657

While its nice to get every episode in one set (not to mention all the bonus material) the way its stored is not so great. On the outside its very attractive, but open it up and its a different story. First the heart shaped lid doesn't attach very well, then the discs are all stored in two fan accordian like holders that make it difficult to get the discs out of. The booklet that comes with it is a nice addition though. Even though the packaging isn't the best I think you can't go wrong getting every single hilarious episode ever made, even the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour shows are included. So overall I'm willing to overlook the poor packaging in order to enjoy this classic show.",1332720000,3,774,4.344827586206897

2898971,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I'm a big fan of the show and I was so pleasantly surprised by this release.  Every time I TiVo the show on broadcast or cable TV, the picture quality is so muddy and flat, I was expecting the DVD to look similar.  Not the case.  All the episode are very very sharp and 10 times more crisp than you will see on TV.  It makes watching the episodes that much more enjoyable. Not only does each disc contain the complete, uncut episodes, but some lost footage has been faithfully restored in order to present the episodes as they originally were BEFORE they were cut up for syndication.  The other nice feature is the extensive chapterization.  Some vintage TV show DVDs just give you each episode as a single chapter.  This set breaks each episode down into multiple chapters.  Additionally, there are lists of flubs and rare Lucille Ball radio shows as well as restored promos that haven't aired in 60 years!!  And if that weren't enough, this is THE ENTIRE Lucy collection.  The final discs contain the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour, which came after the official ""I Love Lucy"" series was over.  The packaging is very nice too.  All discs come in a heart-shaped box.  Very nice.  This collection is worth every penny.  The only way this collection can get better is if everything were remastered for Hi-Def Blu-Ray--which I hope to see someday.",1331596800,,1336,4.625531914893617

2898974,5,B000TGJ8B2,All the discs plus the last few years when it was the same characters but billed as The Lucy and Desi Hour or something like that. Never knew that there was a switch over. There could be a few more behind the scenes secrets after all the years but there was one interesting one--the satin I Love Lucy beginning to each show as not shown during the original run. Also there is actual color video of them on the Manhattan apt set. Who knew the apartment was pink/mauve? Interesting to see it even though it is a little spotty. Interesting. I thought that was iconic. Anyway Lucy makes me laugh and so does Ethel and Fred . . . out loud. Funny harmless show that doesn't offend. I like my entertainment that way usually. And the CDs are packaged color coded fan envelopes. The lid to the box could attach more securely but . . . . Anyway happy with this especially at the discounted price that Amazon ran for a day or two.,1330819200,3,919,4.287356321839081

The audio is great too!  I am so happy I can watch Lucy whenever I want and not have to wait for it to come on TV (which hardly happens anymore).  This show is a classic and this complete series is a great thing to have.  I haven't gotten to watch much of the bonus footage yet, but I can't wait!",1330214400,3,451,3.966666666666667
2898976,2,B000TGJ8B2,"First off, the quality of the shows themselves on here are very good, and I love that the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hours are included.  However, there could have been much more Bonus content.  More TV guest appearances and more other lost treasures, like the Westinghouse Special.  Perhaps this extra content would have added too much to the cost.

Secondly, the main reason for my low rating, the packaging.  It's fun looking, but terrible to deal with, and not a great way to store DVDs.  I much would have preferred a box where individual cases for each season were stored.  One of my discs came cracked, so I had to return the whole thing.  Second set seems okay, however a few discs have darker blotches on the bottoms.  They play okay, but it is concerning.  I read in other reviews of people storing their discs in sleeves, so I got some Tyvek sleeves and did the same.

So, if you can get one without damaged discs, and store them in a better way, it's alright.  Or if you don't mind missing a little bonus content, buy the seasons indivudually.",1329868800,3,1045,4.529411764705882
2898977,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Well I ordered this, and the outside packaging is scuffed on the back.. But This Is the HARDEST packaging to actually open and to put the disks in and out.. great idea.. but... I would stick with the individual seasons.. easier.. and better put together..",1329523200,,255,4.688888888888889
2898978,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I won't go into how much I love ""I Love Lucy.""  I don't see how anyone could argue anything less than a five-star rating for this once-in-a-lifetime series of perfectly matched actors to perfectly matched parts to perfectly matched writers.  It is a series I have watched again and again and will continue to do so.

Some comments have been made regarding closed captions, which my wife and I prefer to have active as we watch most anything on television.  This series DOES have closed captions (in English), but it does not have English subtitles, only Spanish subtitles.  With subtitles, you can turn them off and on at the set-up section once the DVD loads.  With closed captions, you must trigger them with your television remote once the show is loaded onto the screen.  Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen as an overlay, whereas closed captions are usually white letters in a black box and usually show up next to whoever is speaking.

Here is the catchy part, though...you can only see them if you have your DVD player connected with composite cables. I tried activating them with an HDMI connection as well as with a component connection, and nothing.  Then I tried it with a composite connection, and there they were.

I do wish the series had subtitles instead of closed captions, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I've found the same setup with the Frasier series and with the The Andy Griffith Show.  On the other hand, examples of shows that have actual subtitles are MASH and Columbo.

For what it's worth, I looked at the picture quality in HDMI mode as opposed to composite mode, and I couldn't really tell any difference, and this is on a 67-inch screen.  I have a low-cost, standard (non-HD) DVD player already hooked up to my television via its composite connection, so when playing a series with closed caption but without subtitles, I just play it through that unit.

I'll also mention that the series is nicely packaged in a creative container, but accessing each DVD can be a bit of a pain if you want to keep the package in tact.  You have to pull everything out of a hard plastic, clear container, take the pink paper heart off the top of the DVD box, and then you have the first half of the series in a container on the left side and the other half in a container on the right side, each of which can be taken out of the box and then you can flip through the DVD's to select the one you want.  Once finished, the whole thing has to be put back together again.  You'll want to keep the plastic container because of the Lucy photo on the front that really ""makes"" the package. A bit of a hassle, but it really does LOOK great.

Anyway, in summary, a timeless series with creative, albeit awkward, packaging.  Closed captions are there, but you have to have the right connection.  Enjoy!",1329436800,6,2825,4.543478260869565
2898979,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I purchased this beautifully packaged collection at a steal of a price as the Gold Box Deal of the Day.

Right now I'm just enjoying the chance to watch episodes I haven't seen in years, some I haven't even seen at all.

2898982,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Growing up in a Spanish-speaking home, I can tell you that I Love Lucy was one of the few shows in English my family would watch (Lawrence Welk and The Honeymooners being the others). Desi Arnaz was revered in our house as my grandmother absolutely loved him and although she didn't understand a word of what Lucy was saying, adored her as well. This pristine collection takes me back to those years when we'd all huddle around the one TV (B&W) in our home to watch Lucy, Desi, Fred, and Ethel go through their hijinks, innocent deceptions, musical numbers, etc. The rip-roaring laughter we all enjoyed with tears in our eyes - truly great memories, and this collection brings them all back. There are so many classic episodes that I don't really know where to start: the chocolate factory, women from Mars, cousin Ernie, the golf lessons, the bread baking - it goes on and on. The extras are a nice bonus as well. Relive an age of innocence as well as your childhood memories.

2898998,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I'm not going to comment on the quality of the I Love Lucy shows. I do not feel that this is the place for that. Instead, the quality of the DVDs, packaging, etc. is what should be reviewed. First, the packaging was a bit overdone but still delivered the important content, the DVDs themselves, in excellent condition. Inside the fancy outer plastic case were two accordion fold folders that contained the DVDs. I've seen reviewers complain that their disks were damaged by the folders and would have preferred jewel cases for each DVD. My DVDs were in excellent condition and I'm glad they were not in jewel cases because they would have taken up ten or more times the amount of room. The box with the folders keeps everything corralled in a minimal amount of space. If they had eliminated the big cardboard heart on top, it would have been even more compact.

The content on the DVDs was excellent! The first disk was a bonus disk I didn't watch because I wanted to dive into the series. I'm glad I did because much of what is on it is also found on the other disks. Others may feel it is all worth watching.

The episodes were all digitally remastered and, whenever possible, deleted footage was restored. The picture was clear and sharp, better than anything I've ever seen on TV. Each disk also contains bonus features, such as original openings and closings which had been deleted when edited for reruns because of the advertising content or to allow more room for commercials, ""flubs,"" behind the scenes notes, guest star credits (with bios), and an episode of Lucy's radio show, ""My Favorite Husband."" If the only available replacement for missing footage was of too poor a quality to include with the episode, the missing footage was included separately in the bonus section. The bonus section of each disk is well worth watching.

The only complaints I have was occasionally some of the clothing the actors wore would have fine lines or dots which would create moir patterns on screen which would make the clothing appear iridescent  or even flashing at times. I feel the editors could have taken a little more time to eliminate, or at least reduce, these. It didn't happen often but it still was a bit distracting. Two or three episodes had a scene or two that briefly displayed unnecessary Spanish subtitles. If I wanted to see Spanish subtitles, I would have selected them. A few episodes were preceded with a written announcement In Spanish. My high school Spanish is rather rusty (more like corroded) but it appeared they were apologizing that they didn't have Spanish subtitles or dubbing for the following episode. I feel that should have been shown only if Spanish had been selected. I feel these are very minor complaints, especially in light of the excellent quality of everything else.

Considering the number of disks, the amazingly high quality of the video, and the bonus material included, this set is an incredible bargain.",1319328000,2,2949,4.785854616895874
2898999,5,B000TGJ8B2,"The I Love Lucy: The Complete Series is completely amazing. The box is very pretty. The DVD quality is excellent. I really enjoy the episodes. It was worth all the money I paid. I'm thrilled to have this set. It's a masterpiece! Now when there's nothing showing on TV, I don't have to watch something I don't want to; I can just put on an I love Lucy episode.",1318809600,,359,4.217391304347826
2899000,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I bought this collection as a birthday gift for my wife. I Love Lucy is one of her favorite shows and she was very excited when she opened it.

The box itself looks great. It is something that you'll probably want to display, as opposed to just throwing it in a closet somewhere. The big red heart is attached to the lid with glue and I was a little worried about this at first, but so far it hasn't shown any sign of coming loose. My only gripe about the box is a very minor one. The box comes inside of a hard plastic shell. The pictures of Lucy that appear on the front of the case are on this shell, not the box itself. You can look through the user images here on Amazon to get a better idea of what I'm talking about. I think the set is much more attractive with these pictures, so I leave it in the plastic shell at all times. This makes it kind of a pain when you want to swap out discs. On the bright side, it adds a layer of protection to the set and keeps it dust free!

Inside the box are two rows of DVDs and a booklet describing what is on each disc. The DVDs themselves sit in accordion style paper sleeves. I have had no problems with scratching so far. All of the DVDs are in perfect condition.

I am very happy I bought this set. Even though I've seen almost every episode of I Love Lucy multiple times in the past, I still laugh every time, and more importantly, so does my wife. This set has also been a great way for us to spend time together. After we put the kids to bed, we can pop in a disc and snuggle up on the couch together to laugh at Lucy's antics.

Overall, I think this a great product and I would highly recommend it.",1317686400,2,1651,3.993939393939394

Although I watched these extensively in years past on television in syndication, there are episodes from the first season (haven't finished watching that yet) that I do not remember. So that's an extra treat. But even though I'm sure I've seen some episodes more than 10 times over the years, they are still funny; maybe more funny than they were the first time.

2899019,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Other have complained that there are no English Subtitles/Captions.  It's true that when you use the DVD player there are only Spanish Subtitles. This would have been disappointing for me because I generally watch TV with subtitles/captions since my hearing is kind of bad. Luckily, I figured out how to get English Subtitles/Captions to come out when you watch this set! Don't use the Subtitle Menu on your DVD player.  Instead, turn on the Captions under the settings on your TV (like when you'd be watching live or cable TV).  This makes English Subtitles/Captions come out through your TV decoding the information on the DVDs that output captions, rather than through to the DVD itself which doesn't come an English Subtitles option.  I often do this with DVDs that don't have a subtitle option and it works a lot but not all of the time.  It definitely worked on this I Love Lucy: The Complete Series and that made it much more enjoyable to watch without having to strain my ears.  This set is great and it makes me instantly happy to watch any of these episodes.  The bonus features are really interesting and have lots of information about the show, the cast, and even blooper highlights.

I LOVE ""I Love Lucy,"" but I was beyond disappointed when this arrived to discover it was NOT closed captioned, so my husband, who is hard of hearing, cannot enjoy the shows with me. There is an option for subtitles, but SPANISH ONLY-- no English subtitles.

I understand they had 34 discs to work with and plastic cases or holders might have cost too much to produce (I'm guessing), but something else could have been done I think. They are held in cardboard sleeves that fold out accordian style in two ""booklets"". When I pulled the first few out to watch they already had scratches and scuffs. While it's a good price, you don't want new DVDs to look used right off the bat. My advice? Buy the set but invest in a CD/DVD holder to protect your I Love Lucy series! But again, this review is not all negative. This is such a great show and has brought lots of laughs and happiness into my home. When I have a bad day or I'm feeling down, Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred always lift my spirits.

2899052,4,B000TGJ8B2,My wife and I enjoy the good old TV shows and have recently been adding to our collection. The I Love Lucy series is a great addition. This series is packaged in the I Love Lucy box set and everything shipped to me in perfect condition. Amazon's vendor had a competitive price and we are really satisfied. How can a person go wrong with Lucy? Her antics are timeless fun.,1293926400,,371,4.314285714285714

2899054,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Yes, all of the episodes are there, but at least one of them is missing a few seconds I have seen on youtube.  The Comedy Hour episode with Tallulah Bankhead is missing the part where she explains after dinner that she is allergic to strawberries, which is a critical part to understanding a later scene.  Otherwise, this is a great collection to have.

It is mentioned in the bonus material that some recently found lost footage wasn't edited in because of questionable quality.  Why didn't they splice it in anyway, because that would have been easier than punching through the bonuses to view it.  The bonuses are really nice, although somewhat redundant in spots, and I had to take about an hour to scroll through them so as to make sure there was nothing I missed. The booklet description of the bonus material highlights the titles of the included radio shows, and serves as a helpful guide.

There are many cute intros and exits to the episodes that we have not seen on TV Land, but it doesn't include all of the advertisements mentioned in the bonus material.  There are five wonderful Westinghouse promotions they hosted on the bonus of the DVD, Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie, which I also highly recommend as a follow up to a five week marathon of this series (at 1 DVD per day).  The restoration on this collection is really great, with only 3 or 4 splotches they either overlooked or couldn't repair.

Whilst the packaging is beautifully designed, the actual DVDs aren't that well protected in their 2 accordion folders, so one has to be careful replacing and retrieving them.  It is better than other clever packages I've seen, but they could have lined the pockets with protective material to ensure long life.  The manufacturers aren't that interested in going the extra few inches for highly overpriced DVDs and CDs.  My question is, how is Amazon's return policy going to cover this item if one can't watch them all in enough time to discover any damage, and return them within 30 days?  At least 2 DVDs would have to be viewed per day to find out.  I took the chance for this exceptional collection.",1292025600,5,2115,4.650537634408602

I will not comment on the content of the shows since they are simply and delightfully ""Lucy"" shows as one would expect.
The packaging for the complete series is attractive with the heart box and all, but I especially like the accordian-style boxes the disks come in...the disks simply sit in each fold of the accordian so I just take them out and drop them back in...no hurting my finger trying to 'pop' them in and out of a plastic disk holder with a locking seat.

From a bit player at MGM, ""I Love Lucy"" rocketed Lucille Ball to national awareness on that newfangled TV thing.  And if your not a Lucy fan yet, you'll see foundational work for modern television.

While the show reflects its times, the sitcom set up and slap stick humor laid the ground work for countless sitcoms to come.  Even if some of the references to then current pop culture fly by, the actions and reactions are priceless.

The quality of this set is outstanding.  There's lots of bonus material including episodes of the pre-I Love Lucy radio show that led to the TV show.  Notes on some shows help you understand some of the underlying creative process.  And the video quality is great.  In one episode, you can actually see a fly land on Lucy's head as she's explaining her latest escapade.",1271289600,3,903,4.559006211180124

2899074,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This is one of the best TV shows of all time. As far as content and clarity goes, this DVD set really delivers. However, I'm here to review the packaging because it's just that bad! In fact, as others have pointed out, it's frustrating to the point of being comical. I can't believe someone actually agreed to release this set the way it is.

To get at the DVDs, you have to go through an adventure in poor design. For starters, the flaps on the [side] of the outer plastic box are quite rigid. You must pull these open so you can slide the contents out [horizontally]. Inside the clear outer box is light plastic insert sitting on top of the heart-shaped DVD case. Because the DVD case is heavier than the plastic insert, getting the two out in synch and back in again is somewhat of an art form since the light insert tends to get stuck on the outer packaging.

Now, if you manage to get the heart-shaped DVD case out without dropping everything on the floor, you'll be greeted with the challenge of navigating the DVD case. The big red heart lifts up to access the individual discs, but when you want to put it back, you have to pull the sides apart because it fits like a snug saddle. If you're not careful, you'll end up cramming the heart into the DVD case.

Finally, we come to the layout of the DVD ""case"". It's nice they included a color-coded booklet, but this is only of limited assistance since it's nearly impossible to find the exact disc you're looking for while the ""accordion"" divider is inside the box (color-coded or not). You could take the divider out, but your discs will probably end up all over the floor. If you leave it in, then you have to fumble around until you find the disc you're looking for. This means spreading the flaps with your fingers on one hand, while using your index and thumb on your other hand to pinch the DVD and pry it [up] from inside the box. (this is the only way I've figured out how to do this so far.) Unfortunately, you'll end up getting your finger prints all over the read surface of the DVDs -- if not scratching them. But don't worry, with packaging like this, there's a good chance some of the discs already come scratched from the factory!

My guess is that appearance was more important than functionality, and as artwork goes, it is a nice looking box set. However, if you're concerned about scratching your discs, then I STRONGLY suggest you invest a few more dollars to buy the seasons individually. Those sets come in proper plastic cases. If you do purchase this and wish to use it frequently, then I recommend you purchase some blank DVD cases!",1269648000,59,2612,4.435416666666667
2899075,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Early on in her career Lucille Ball attended a swanky acting school in New York, and she was summarily dismissed from the school. The reason for her dismissal was having no talent whatever, and I surmise this prompted the key point in the I Love Lucy series that Lucy was talentless. This is a key ingredient in many good comedy routines. However, comedians and comdienes must have an exceptional intellect, if they are to be good, and this is because they must know how something is supposed to work in order to screw up consistently every time. In this they help to prove one of my basic philosophies, and this is that there is no issue so simple that it cannot be completely misconstrued.",1269648000,,691,4.580645161290323

But face it: it's a pain in the proverbial butt, opening it to get at the discs and then reassembling all the components to close it when you put it back on the shelf...assuming you have enough shelf space to hold this turkey. What I plan on doing is buying several DVD sleeves and storing the discs in them, leaving the box and the heart-shaped top and the plastic cover, etc., in storage somewhere. (Can you imagine the complete AMOS & ANDY series, if it ever got packaged, having something similar? I can just picture Andy's derby or the Kingfish's fedora or Andy's cabbie cap...maybe all three...in a flip-top box.

The box itself is a pretty clever work of art.  I'd recommend keeping the clear plastic sleeve and insert since the box is an odd shape and hard to keep dust free or stack on a shelf if you need to do so at some point.  The actual DVD's are in two fan style boxes shaped as half hearts.  Not bad, but sometimes a little fussy to toggle through.

One of the best things is that it has the lost pilot.  The very beginning narration is actually a restoration with the original narrator re-recording his lines (you can hear it's an older gentleman).

2899093,5,B000TGJ8B2,"Having recently viewed some 80s and 90s sitcoms I realized how quickly (and badly) television comedy can date.  Age really does weary them and the years condemn.  This is partly due to repetition and partly because the comedy probably wasn't all that good to begin with.

In a radio interview in 2008, Jerry Lewis noted that modern comedians had told him that his visual style of comedy was out of date - he responded that visual comedy never went out of date, it's just that modern comedians don't have the discipline or the work ethic to pull it off.  Lewis hit the nail on the head - modern comedians, often lacking maturity; life experience; breadth of skills or even a willingness to serve a long-term comedic apprenticeship simply don't have the tools to create lasting comedy.  If we accept that comedic talent doesn't just fall out of the sky - and that it does require years (decades) of hard work, then we have a real problem.  We now have a television industry that doesn't want anyone over the age of 25 appearing in their shows and the result is a collection of sitcoms that are little more than strings of sarcastic one-liners in which every line has been audience tested for reaction.  Mechanical, formula-driven, repetitive and time limited.

Lucille Ball was (still is) one of the all-time comedy greats of American television - whether at visual comedy; slapstick; pathos; quick one-liners or any other facet of what makes us laugh.  Combine Lucille Ball with an  ensemble of other highly skilled and experienced performers like Desi Arnaz; Vivian Vance and William Frawley and you have all the basics for a timeless comedy.  Superimpose upon this some brilliant scriptwriting and you have ""I Love Lucy"".  Almost six decades old and still as funny as ever.  And you can bet that it will still be just as funny in another six decades - Seinfeld got tiresome after one decade, despite being hailed as the comedy guru of the 1990s.

The only downside of watching the nearly 200 episodes in this collection is that eventually you'll have to go back to watching the current crop of sitcoms, only to be even more disappointed with them than you were before.  That's when you have to unpack the first DVD in this box set and start viewing I Love Lucy all over again.

This collection is cheap at twice the price.

If you are interested in this then you should also consider buying the other comedic genius of the era - Groucho Marx in ""You Bet Your Life"".",1243123200,5,2466,4.671296296296297

There's bonus material on each disc (all ~40 or so), including flubs, lost intros, bumps, commercials, footage of Lucy and Desi doing little charity PSAs, etc...it's just tremendous fun.
The episodes look great, and of course they're all there: every word, no jarring edits.  It includes the Lucy-Desi hours, which I personally think are pretty mediocre, but they do have some funny bits.
Another bonus feature is audio excerpts of Jess Oppenheimer's book, read by someone else who does a nice job, AND a short interview with Jess himself from God-knows-when!!

The DVD quality is pretty good, it also has a bonus section in each disc, which my girls love to watch too. It worth every penny. Glad that I bought it.",1240185600,,722,3.9383561643835616

2899109,1,B000TGJ8B2,"This is NOT a review of the content (TV shows), but of the packaging that results in the DVD discs being scratched.  The fragile optical discs are stored in folders, instead of being suspended in a stationary position.  When the discs are placed in the folders at the manufacturing plant the discs are scratched. When the box set is shipped, the two folders holding the discs move in all directions, as do the discs.  The friction between the two result in scratching of the fragile optical side of the DVD.
What you should receive from the studio is pristine DVDs, not scratched discs that you will receive.
Even if you are willing to accept the above, you should obtain individual DVD cases to store the DVDs.

I cannot recommend the purchase of a ""NEW"" I Love Lucy: The Complete Series.  Suggestion, purchase a ""used"" set, which will cost less and look the same.",1238976000,71,865,4.627450980392157

I was SO EXCITED to see this set on sale and sold my first season's discs (for way too low, I've now realized) to make room for this set.

Here are the greats:
- the box is cute and decorative
- the discs are arranged in such a way that's easily accessible and very compact
- you're not missing ONE single episode

Here are the problems with the set/DVDs:
- NO English captions?  I thought that's standard these days
- the last few seasons were not ""seasons"" but just a few shows at most
- I'm a bit scared how the discs will weather in a few years because they're protected by cardboard, not plastic

Truth of the matter is spending $150 on a complete season of a great show isn't too much to shell out.  I just wish I knew about the ""problems"" in my opinion about these dvds.",1235606400,6,945,4.1256830601092895

They made you laugh without being vulgar or using explicit language.  This is set contains every lucy episode ever aired and some great bonus features.

There are so many DVD-Discs and many hours of I Love Lucy Shows, not to mention the ""extras""; Things that have not been seen on TV for 50 years or perhaps have never been seen on TV at all. This is a GREAT gift for the Lucy Lovers out there and without a doubt, was THE CHEAPEST price anywhere at the time, just before Christmas. On the net, in EVERY store, ANYWHERE. (Under $100) Oddly, right after Christmas the price went up substantially so I feel even better about paying ($99.00) as it's now back up to $189.00 as of today. The shows have been digitally remastered and are uncut. Many TV shows today get chopped down to make room for more commercials, not these. And they look great on our 55"" Hi-Def TV. Highly recommended. Great collectors item and one of the RARE DVD's that you WILL actually watch more than once.

The packaging is a little odd, but the discs are first rate with great bonuses. On broadcast/cable TV we see edited, commerical ladden episodes with all those ""coming attractions"" at the bottom of your screen. Do your self a favor and purchase this collection.

The complete series box - take it out of the plastic and it's a rectangle with the heart shape over it.  Pull up on the heart to reveal the discs, which have no individual protection, only a cardboard insert backing each disc -- this means, go out to the store and buy a case of 50 paper sleeves and ditch the cardboard inserts inside this box.

I have yet to inspect every disc, and I hope none is severely scratched.  Not likely; I had worse trouble with the Cosby Show 25th anniversary set, and those issues were surprisingly few and minor -- and I bought envelopes for those discs too.

It's a bit on the cheap side, this box, but even having to do the extra work in procuring disc envelopes, for an extra $4, it's a good price for a great series.  But expect this trend to continue for many more shows; particularly complete series sets.

If this is the way of the future, I hope more companies do what was done for ""Sanford and Son - the complete series"":  One plastic tray/caddy with all the discs inside and fitted with one cardboard piece.  No fuss, no muss.  Easy to repackage with envelopes and put back into the main box too, unlike ""The Cosby Show"".",1230940800,16,1412,4.343511450381679

2899160,5,B000TGJ8B2,"There were many great TV shows that came out in the 1950s. But three shows come to mind that are as popular today as they were back then. The Honeymooners, The Adventures Of Superman, and of course I Love Lucy. The longest running first-run of the three. However, this is not a lesson in 1950s television, nor is it a history of I Love Lucy. The goal of this review is to let potential buyers make an informed decision. Getting the most enjoyment and ease of use will depend on two basic elements. Common sense and shelf space dimensions. First cut the tape that hold the flap of the clear plastic case. Next, slide the box set out. I made a personal choice to cut off the left side flap  for ease of sliding the box set in and out. With the front of the box set facing you, lift the big red heart and place to the side. Inside you will find a booklet. Remove the booklet. This will give you easy access to the disc holders. The left side holder holds the special bonus disc and Seasons 1 through 3. The right side holder holds Season 4 through 6 for the regular I Love Lucy show and Seasons 7 through 9 for the continuation spin off series The Lucille-Desi Comedy Hour. 17 discs per holder. 34 discs in all and with bonus features on all of them. Now, here comes the commom sense part. Do not turn the box set upside down as this will cause all your discs to fall all over the floor. A reviewer did write that all their discs went all over the floor, but either deleted their review or edited that part out. Let us begin. Select the holder of your choice. Hold the accordion style disc holder facing toward you in one hand. With the other hand, use your fingers in the same manner as searching for a file in a filing cabinet, use  sensible gentleness to search for the disc of choice. When you find it, just widen the gap a little to allow the disc to be lifted easily. Use the same method to place the disc back. If by chance you happen to be one handed use something else to support the holder. If these simple instructions are followed the disc holders should never rip or tear. Now for the the shelf space dimensions. This will affect different people in different ways. If you have a clearance height of at least nine inches on your shelf the box set can be displayed upright in a sideview position like any other disc or box set. A depth of 12 inches on your shelf from front to back would be optimal, but 8 inches is enough to keep it from falling to the floor. If you still feel you lack the common sense and/or the accomodations to store this set then stick with or purchase the regular I Love Lucy Seasons 1 through 6 box set and the Lucy-Desi Seasons 7-9 to get almost the same thing as this box set. I don't know if the special bonus disc is or will be available for purchase. Good luck to all.",1226275200,4,2807,4.205936920222634
2899161,5,B000TGJ8B2,"The first sitcom of all time, the one that served as the formula for all others is still one of the funniest.

It's a show everyone grew up watching, and many of the episodes can be seen numerous times and will always be funny.

An interesting aspect of watching it today is realizing how much the world (including the TV world) has changed since then.  Seeing Lucy and Ricky sleeping on different beds, never using the word ""pregnant,"" and the now politically-incorrent gender roles in the series, really takes us back to the 1950s.

Some of the slapstick humor is even kind of corny today, and there's none of the ironic or sarcastic humor seen in many of today's comedies, but this nostalgic trip back in time to a near-perfect world that never really existed, is something most who watched this show through the decades will want to get.

This perfect DVD collection includes the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" and is loaded with extra features, including ""lost"" episodes, the couple's first TV appearance, their presence at the Emmys getting their award, an on-set commercial from the series premiere, and a colorized ""Lucy Goes to Scotland"" episode, among many other extras no fan will want to miss.",1224547200,5,1198,4.824390243902439

2899167,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This ""I Love Lucy"" Series is wonderful. All of the episodes are included, as well as the Bonus section which has the flubs, write-ups on all the actors. Plus, the background stuff which really fills in the gaps of why a particular episode or the series was done.

When the series first arrived, I watched all the episodes. Now, I am going through the series a second time and watching all the bonus stuff (flubs, etc. just described) and then each episode.

Do I still watch ""I Love Lucy"" on television? Yes, I usually do, but I have to admit that I am now very spoiled by the DVDs where there are no commercials (except on the Bonus section) and I can watch the original sequence of episodes from the first program to the last. I can really get a feel for how the entire lives of Lucy and Ricky developed. Plus, the DVD episodes are 19/20 minutes each and so I can almost watch two during the time I would watch one episode on television. Thus, if I decide to watch something else or go somewhere, then I do it, because I now have the entire series of episodes on DVDs.

An academic approach includes the fact that I now have time to notice all the good times and the problems of the 1950s----it's a super history/sociology lesson. Most of all I can laugh. However, I have to admit that in 2008, while some episodes are still very funny, others are thought provoking.

I would highly recommend the ""I Love Lucy"" Series to anyone who has enjoyed watching ""I Love Lucy"" either when the episodes first appeared on television or as reruns. I continually notice that they had no cell phones and no 24 hour news. It seems strange, when Lucy gets out her old typewriter, instead of a computer, to write a play or a note. While I am laughing, I notice more of the differences in my life, since the 1950s. For instance, Lucy and Ethel always wear hats, when they go out. Plus, Ethel won't ride the New York City Subway in her blue jeans. Addtionally, the price of a token was only 15 cents. Thus, I feel sure that I will continue to watch ""I Love Lucy"" and laugh or cry and feel either sad or happy that I don't live in the 1950s anymore.",1216512000,8,2130,4.3175

Like most Amazon shoppers, I always read the reviews before purchasing items, and when this product first came to market many of the Amazon reviews were luke-warm.  One common criticism was the packaging.  Aside from the clear outer sleeve, I find the packaging to be durable, attractive and unique.  I especially like the accordion disc holders, of which there are two--one holding seasons 1-3, and the other holding seasons 4-9.  In addition, there is a nicely produced episode guide. All of the contents are enclosed in a box, topped with the familiar, heart-shaped ""I Love Lucy"" logo.  I've been a Lucy fan for more than 35 years, and there's very little about ""I Love Lucy I don't know. The ""I Love Lucy Movie"" is really three episodes of the series linked together with behind the scenes footage that was never released. Still, to any ""Lucy"" fan this is pure gold! And while I'm not a fan of colorization, the technique employed on the ""Lucy Goes to Scotland"" episode rings more authentic than earlier colorization efforts. It's so interesting to see the different colors on the clothing and the sets, not to mention Lucy's hair.  The complete set includes the ""Lost Pilot"", the ""Christmas Show"" from 1956, and all thirteen Lucy-Desi hour-long specials, which were produced after ""I Love Lucy"" ended.

Where would these yentas be without Lucy?

Lucy did it first & Lucy did it best.

I don't now anyone who doesn't:
A) Know who Lucy is
B) Love Lucy

Ms. Lucille Ball (may she rest in peace) was a genius. She really invented the modern television program. The things that we take for granted today were all because of this classic sitcom. It was all brand-new for her and when you watch these eps now it all looks like Lucy was doing it for years and years. But that doesn't mean that she also doesn't look and sound fresh and funny. Lucy was such a kook. Or maybe clown is a better word to describe her because there isn't another person on this planet that will go to such great lengths just to make someone else laugh.

It's sad to think that TV these days isn't even one one-millionth as good as ""I Love Lucy"" always was. Like many people, I do not watch the reality potluck garbage that broadcast network TV has lazily morphed into. Instead, I'd rather read a book. Or watch ""I Love Lucy.""

Some have said that Lucille Ball wasn't acting on ""I Love Lucy,"" that she was just playing another extension of herself. I tend to disagree. There isn't a better TV actress in the entire history of television because Lucy Ricardo was so incredibly different from Lucy Ball. The 2 looked alike but that's really where the similarities end.

The entire cast was also perfect. Fred & Ethel Mertz (William Frawley & Vivian Vance who hated each other, almost as much as the characters they played) were just icing on the cake. And Ricky (Desi Arnaz) was usually the voice of reason which only made it that much more funny when he'd often abandon all hope and join Lucy with whatever hairball scheme she had up her sleeve, next.

Every single show on this comedic masterpiece is pure entertainment and pure quality. Lucille Ball was a workaholic that never did anything unless it was Perfect. And even though these eps are all over 50 years old, they're each still very relatable. That's because Lucy's method of comedy was so universal. She didn't put on airs or get on her soapbox. This lady was just here to make us laugh. That was it. The best medicine in the world for whatever is hurting you is a good laugh.",1212624000,10,2352,4.517647058823529
2899175,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I should have titled this review:
""The DVD set I ALMOST bought,but didn't"".
This is the only review of a DVD set I do NOT own,but TRIED to get and failed.
First let me review the series then I will get to my bugaboo about the packaging in the second half.
The series itself,as everyone knows,has a stellar position in television
history. Lucille Ball was a struggling bit player at RKO then later for MGM who eventually managed to garner some lead roles in lesser pictures. She was a smart and ambitious actress who paid her dues and learned her lessons very well. During the war she met and romanced with Cuban band leader Desi Arnaz. They eventually married and Desi also became an actor. In the early 50s Desi and Lucy decided to develop a sitcom. Both would star, with Desi heavy into the production end and Lucy concentrating on her comedy schtick for the camera. Desi had the show filmed,a virtual first,which is why we are still able to Love Lucy after all these years. Lucy as I said was one smart lady and she had learned alot about comedy over the years from her days at the studios. She knew who to get advice from when she needed it and one of the most important was one of the greatest gag men/comedians of all time,Buster Keaton.
The show started in 1951 and wasn't a giant hit right off the bat. The first year was touch and go and Lucy and Desi worked their tails off to perfect and improve everywhere they could. By the second year the ratings improved dramtically and by the third they were the biggest thing on TV.And why not?The audience loved(and still does) the interplay between Lucy and Desi(husband and wife) and the dynamic their neighbours Fred and Ethel Mertz(William Frawley and Vivian Vance,respectfully) brought to the entire series. Like the great comedians of old Lucy showed audiences that you didn't need to constantly talk in order to be funny. Many of the routines and situations Lucy gets herself into in these shows are done without uttering a single syllable. And they are for the most part simply hilarious. This show is the cream of the crop as far as television is concerned,a benchmark in many ways. And it is an essential to anyone interested in wholesome,genuinely funny and just plain excellent television programming.
Now for the other half of this review,and it all revolves around the packaging. When my set arrived I was first surprised at how thin it was,maybe six inches. The set itself is rectangular,encased in thick plastic with Lucys' picture on the front. You open a flap on the right side and slide out the contents. The bottom half is square while the top half has the shape of a heart. On top of the heart is a form fitting piece of plastic to fill the gaps the heart doesn't,to keep it tight inside. You remove that piece then you lift up the heart to reveal two smaller hearts sitting at the bottom inside of the case,and a booklet. The smaller hearts contain all the DVDs in this set. They are open topped and like accordians. Each DVD sits loose inside one of these accordian slots.
I placed my order for a set and the first one that came I started to check each DVD and found the very first disc had a nasty looking scratch on it. That set I returned and ordered a replacement. In the second set I got to about the seventh DVD when I found a scratch on that one!!
I have had this kind of thing happen before and instead of prolonging the inevitable I decided to call it a day and get a refund. What a shame too as there hasn't been many sets I was looking forward to as much as I was this one.
How the scratches got on those DVDs is difficult to say. There was nothing in the accordian shaped holders to indicate anything that could have scratched them. But the very idea that they sit loose and can move around bothers me. The manufacturers also may be to blame with sub standard DVDs and/or poor equipment.
Furthermore if you wanted to take a few episodes over to show old Aunt Sadie the ONLY way you could safely take them is to take the ENTIRE set with you. If you just threw one of the heart DVD holders into a plastic bag and took them over like you would an ordinary slipcase,you would find the entire collection sitting loose at the bottom of the bag,and probably all scratched.
The concept for this set was unique and is nice to look at. But in practical terms it comes up a complete failure. I can only hope sometime in the future Paramount Home video takes some notes and reissues this set in nice,tight slimpacks. It is really the only way to go.
In conclusion I highly recommend the Lucy series to everyone out there. But fair warning to those who are contemplating buying this set:caveat emptor!",1207785600,4,4675,4.462616822429907
2899176,5,B000TGJ8B2,"So happy I purchased this collection, the bonus features are great.  It's so good to see the entire episodes, without any edits.  The original Phillip Morris comercials, are such a hoot.  Excellent choice.",1206403200,3,205,5.151515151515151
2899177,5,B000TGJ8B2,"I've been wanting to get the entire series of ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD, but it was if you had to buy in in dribs & drabs. I finally saw the entire series, plus ""The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour,"" (their exploits once they moved to CT) so I splurged. My wife & I watched the entire series (no, not in one sitting) and sat & laughed ourselves silly. Of course, you see basically the same episodes running on a daily basis on some channel somewhere, but to be able to watch them all in the order they were televised was fascinating. The pilot episode, which takes place in a totally different apartment, makes you realize how primitive early television was. There's a parade of character actors & actresses throughout the series that you recognize from other TV shows & film work. Everyone works together so well, the chemistry is incredible. (Even thought in real life Vance & Frawley loathed each other, it never surfaces)I could go on & on, but trust me, it's well worth owning!",1205020800,5,967,4.5

2899181,5,B000TGJ8B2,"This is simply the full series of 'I Love Lucy"" lovingly restored in all their complete uncut glory.  If that isn't reason enough to buy this set I don't know what is.  Just like the individual season sets, many many episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband"" are included as well as audio interviews with show creators, flubs, cast biographies and the original animated Lucy and Desi intro and outro at the commercial break.  It's an incredible amount of history and insight that's a joy to find all in one place.  And special to this release is extra disc featuring the never-before-released I Love Lucy Movie as well as a fully colorized episode and a few other fun bonuses.

It's lovely to have the series so beautifully presented.  I mean that in terms of the picture and audio quality as well as the DVD packaging.  The discs are in two paper and cardboard accordion style cases with a large size booklet so you can find the episode you want to watch.  The only complaint I have (and it's minor) is that the images of Lucy aren't on the actual box but on a clear plastic box encasing the heart which makes getting at the DVDs a bit more difficult than it should be.  Also I fear the plastic box will rip or tear after repeated openings.  The only option is to display the set without the slip case, but then the packaging is not as eye catching.  It's a testament to the excellent work done on this set that a packaging gripe is the most negative thing I can say.  Any Lucy fan who doesn't already have the season sets should pick this up immediately.",1200441600,19,1566,4.437062937062937

The paper disc holders, while again clever, accordion open to dispense the discs, but seem flimsy and easily torn.  All in all, I would have preferred a simpler, less whimsical package.

Of the extra features, the revelation is the colorized Lucy Goes to Scotland.  Although a staunch opponent of colorizing classic TV, I found myself enrapt with this episode.

2899198,1,B000TGJ8B2,"Frankly, I'm tired of this. We buy each season box as it comes out, and then the studio releases the entire series in one box with extras not available everywhere else.

It's getting so that I'm about to stop buying each season and simply wait for the inevitable box set, but then we end up in the situation that Mary Tyler Moore is in, where the early seasons supposedly aren't selling well enough to release the final seasons on DVD!",1193011200,85,435,4.4375
2899199,4,B000TGJ8B2,Usually Amazon is very good with their prices...but I have found this listed on 2 other sites at a List price of $195 & selling for $150-155 on those 2 sites!! Y is Amazon charging so much for this set??,1189900800,11,203,4.1

8209018,5,B000TGJ8B2,"The show of course is phenomenal and timeless. I've seen all of these episodes more times than I know and can basically quote them word for word at this point. Still, I find myself enjoying them and laughing each and every time. I wasn't around during the original run of this show but I can certainly understand why it was and still is such a big hit. So many classic episodes that you could almost list the entire run of the show and be justified and saying they're all worthy of that distinction. It's great to finally have all of the episodes at my disposal to watch at my leisure and I don't regret the purchase at all.

I give this 5 stars but there is a downside that doesn't have to do with the show itself but rather the packaging that is used for the discs. I am not a fan of the style of casing they chose for this set. It actually happens more than it should with large collections like this. They often go with some form of terrible packaging that is easy to have the discs come lose in the case, possibly causing scratches or they make it very inconvenient where it can make it difficult to even get to the discs themselves. I have a couple of collections like this where I've simply opted to put all of the discs in individual jewel cases and just display the packaging itself on my shelf. I was lucky in that my discs were fine but I've definitely fallen victim to problems with this type of packaging before with other sets.

I am still overall satisfied with the purchase and have been thoroughly enjoying a marathon of the show since I received it.",1525910400,,1567,4.308474576271187

8209023,1,B000TGJ8B2,"I received this as a Christmas gift 2 years ago. I moved shortly after Christmas and put the unopened box set in storage where just a few weeks ago, I pulled it out and started watching. Shortly after, I find that I am missing Season 4, disc 1. Its a little annoying but I slowly overtime have gotten over it. There are 2 cases in the box set - Seasons 1 through 5 and in a separate case, Seasons 6 through 9. When I got to the 2nd case. The only season in that case was Season 6. There are 4 cd slots and 4 discs for Season 6. Where are Seasons 7,8 and 9? Good questions. I am one out of millions that love Lucy and its a little disappointing to open a box set and find that items are missing.

On another note, the holders containing the DVDs are broke all to pieces and horrible packaged. Not only that but DVDs weren't in order which makes me think I got a used set when it clearly states new on my mothers order history.",1525046400,,925,4.0
8209024,3,B000TGJ8B2,"Love all the episodes and nice sturdy box to keep it in.

My complaint is the box inside plastic holder all came off and the DVDs were a little to hard to take out and put back in (ended up scratching 2 of them because of this)

otherwise happy with my purchase :)",1524787200,,264,3.9622641509433962
