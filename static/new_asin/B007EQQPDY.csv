8515459,1,B007EQQPDY,"Steve Jobs:Consciously Genius is almost an hour-long unauthorized documentary about the late Steve Jobs,the co-founder of Apple Computer. It talk about his contribution to the advancement of technology during his tenure at Apple,NEXT and Pixar. Aside from that,it talks about his passion and ingenuity have been the driving force behind the digital age. Added to that,it also discusses his personal life.

Too bad that I categorize this as one of the most unsatisfactory documentary made about the late Apple co-founder. It is full of inaccuracies and factually incorrect especially with the presentation of the history of Apple during the early years. It claims that LISA was the first computer of Apple when in fact it was Apple I.Also,it tells everyone that LISA predated Apple I when in fact it was the Macintosh. The people who made this documentary obviously did not do their homework with regards to research and accuracy as far as making a documentary is concerned. In addition to that,the people who were interviewed in it barely knows the man at all. And it was definitely boring and uninteresting. Overall,it looks amateurish and it was definitely poorly made.

For better documentaries,I would recommend Steve Jobs:The Last Thing and Steve Jobs:The Lost Interview. Skip this one.",1442102400,4,1291,5.231884057971015
