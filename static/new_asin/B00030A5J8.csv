2154516,4,B00030A5J8,"It's a great dvd, but a bit hard for step beginners.  I can do parts one and two, but after that I am spent.  I know that leaves me time to strengthen up but I was looking for something a little easier to start off with.  I suggest watching the warm up and sections a few times before trying them out.  I watched the warm up and section one about 4 times before I tried it out and just started on section 2 today.  I watched the whole tape and you must be pretty fit to go all the way.",1154649600,8,485,3.81
2154517,5,B00030A5J8,"Although I think Gilad is a little goofy, this is the best exercise DVD I have used/own. The reason why is because:

- he warns you of a change in step before it happens and he's consistent about this

- his counting is never off - or at least I haven't discovered any counting errors

- the videographers don't try to get artsy with the cuts, so there is never a cut at the outset of a new step or a transition between steps (I haven't found any other exercise DVD that can boast this and this is important if you want to learn the steps and keep up)

- although the steps themselves are realitively simple, the way Gilad combines them is quite challenging cardio-wise

- the overall combinations are fun

The only thing you need to know about him is that he will say that you're getting ready to do the ""last one;"" and instead of meaning the very last step, he means the last combination of steps (one to each side, left and right). So for instance, if you are stepping up on the step and kicking with, first the left foot, and then you switch to the right foot (step up and kick). Instead of the final right foot kick being the ""last one,"" Gilad means the last set of left and right kicks. (I hope that made sense. If you get the DVD, I think it will.)",1152230400,124,1255,4.1652892561983474
2154518,5,B00030A5J8,"I used to work out with Gilad long ago when his show was on ESPN.  When I found myself in desperate need of losing weight, I turned to him again.  I never get tired of this workout - I have been using this video for about 3 years now, and I definitely credit this with my 85 pound weight loss.  You get a great workout - but it's not so challenging that you want to quit.  You can build on the workout as you become more fit.  Yes, the clothing is dated, but it gets the job done - cardio and ab workout, too!

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!!",1148601600,24,542,4.018691588785047
2154519,5,B00030A5J8,"I PURCAHSED THIS DVD LAST YEAR SO I COULD IT USE ON THE DAYS I CAN'T GET TO THE GYM, AND IT CRACKED IN THE CENTER AND BEGAN TO SKIP.  I HAD TO REPLACE IT. THIS IS A GREAT DVD AND PROVIDES AN EVEN BETTER WORKOUT.",1138060800,4,211,3.5869565217391304
2154520,5,B00030A5J8,"Gilad basically invented Stepping!  21 years on TV, still going strong.  He knows what he's talking about!",1122249600,8,106,5.176470588235294
2154521,4,B00030A5J8,"I used to do Gilad videos in the early 90s when I was in high school and I always liked him. I thought his videos were challenging. I decided to purchase this dvd to see what the deal was with Gilad today, but this DVD is from like 1993. So it's pretty dated as far as their clothes go, but I still love it! If you like Gilad, you'll like this. You either love him or hate him. I love him! I think he's GREAT!  Its a very challenging, fun video and it gives you the option to intensify the movements to make it even more challenging. The setting is at a beach resort in Hawaii and although some people might find this a little hokey, I was totally into it. I could almost imagine myself at this beach (yes wishfull thinking..) And even the best excercise dvds are pretty corny, this one is really good. I only gave it 4 stars because I would have like a little more difficult combinations, but they were still pretty challenging none the less. If you need to lose weight, this is the way! The ab workout is great too! Gilad defiantely stands the test of time! Definately purchase this workout if you want to burn calories (which burns fat!!) and also step aerobics certainly tones your legs too. If you don't have a gym membership and work out at home like I do, you can be pretty limited on what your equipment is. But step aerobics really tones up your calves and thighs. This is an excellent DVD and I definately recommend it for all fitness levels. If you are a beginner, don't do the arms and don't jump the movements and walk in place if you need to catch your breathe. If you are advanced then you can definately power it up and get a great workout!",1112313600,225,1656,4.2405063291139244

2154529,5,B00030A5J8,"If you are like me and invested in purchasing a stepper, it's hard to find new workouts for it.  As you can tell from the outfits worn by the women on the front jacket of this dvd, this is an older one.  But, please, don't let that stop you from buying it!  It's just a fantastic workout and so much fun.  I hate getting bored when I am exercising, and you definitely won't get bored doing this one.  At the same time,  there are a lot of step workouts that I have given up on, because the movements are so complicated and confusing that I can't enjoy doing them.  This workout by Gilad is just perfect - a blend of different movements, but not hard to follow. !  I couldn't recommend it more highly!",1505347200,,700,4.1716417910447765

Bursted in laughter when I saw it again in 2017, the fashion etc :-)  But: the moves are simple, instructions are clear, the sequences are easy to follow; and it's easy to control progress depending on the level of fitness. I think that step workout choreorgaphy shouldn't be overcomplicated, and this workout is exactly what I needed: it's all about singles and repeaters, nothing fancy. Want to make it more challenging - increase the height of your step. It is a great step workout!!",1504483200,2,607,4.726415094339623

Also has a cool down as all step workouts should have and an additional abs workout.  By the time you're done - you're really done...lol!  Excellent all round and love working out to this every day.  You won't be bored or even find it easy as you can scale up by adding levels to your step as you progress and get stronger.  I highly recommend it.",1503532800,,468,4.32183908045977

So I noticed this video had an amazing amount of popularity (4.5 stars and 231 reviews). I decided to give it a shot. In the introduction Gilad drives up on a motorcycle. I have a Honda shadow so I am already hooked. I watched the workout and I was so impressed that I went ahead and purchased the step tool. Within a couple days I began stepping with Gilad. At first its very challenging but as you learn the moves you become able to start stepping to the music (or really its dancing in my opinion). I am just a middle-aged, overweight guy looking for a good, professional workout before I go to work and this was what I was looking for.",1473033600,,769,4.273972602739726

He is very charismatic and capable. The routine is HARD. I got through it but had to rest the next day due to being worn out.

The workout is broken down into 10 minute segments and builds from beginner to intermediate-advanced. Yes, it is a bit dated and the music is tropical (not my favorite), but you don't even notice any of that once you start moving. I also love the ab workout on this DVD.

2154710,5,B00030A5J8,I've tried several step aerobic routines via DVD and this is my favorite. It provides a great cardio and strength workout without the convoluted moves I've seen in other exercise DVD's of this genre. As an older woman with a few sprained ankles in her history I appreciate the simplicity of this routine. It is not difficult to follow but at the same time it is challenging.,1426982400,,374,4.597014925373134

2154737,5,B00030A5J8,"Don't let the fashions fool you...this is really a great workout! Plus, you get to do a little time-traveling back to 1990s Hawaii. I was really missing spandex on men and this DVD brings it back in a BIG way. And by BIG, I mean...well... Oh, back to the review. I had taken step-aerobics classes about 10 years ago and found I really enjoyed it. I decided it would be good to have an indoor workout for the winter months and this fits the bill. The moves from the classes I'd taken are in this, so it all came back to me pretty fast. And Gilad is good about repeating the moves he introduces so you have time to figure out what you're doing. I was trying to get my husband to do the workout, but he refuses to wear spandex. I'll keep working on that.",1417996800,17,751,4.1506849315068495

2154766,4,B00030A5J8,"This DVD is kind of for basic beginners. It is good, however and you work up a good sweat using it. I like the older '90's workouts better than today's fast-paced dance move workouts that you can't keep up with. Great DVD.",1397865600,,222,4.309523809523809

Although the movements are not fast and intense, it's still challenging and when you're done you know you've burned calories.  I like that there is an older man in this workout, so it's obvious that it's cross-generational.

Honolulu is one of my favorite places on earth, and the setting (with Diamond Head in the background) had a little something to do with my choosing this particular workout.  I read many other reviews that were predominantly positive.  I'm happy that I ordered this workout and my goal is to be able to do it all the way through without stopping.",1387497600,5,721,4.72

I also 'fly over' and 'propel' for all segments.  When I need to ramp up my activity and get cardio in this is THE one and only workout I do.  Yes, it was made in 1993 but who cares?

It is silly and goofy and funny but it's a great workout. A good classic step burn, moves that are challenging but not too hard to demotivate you. I really like it.

Its an excellent step routine that you can amp up or ease down to get the level of intensity you want.  The basic steps are easy to follow and the camera work doesn't generally leave you wondering what direction to go next.

Admittedly, this DVD is pretty old school, but its a solid step workout with four 10 minute sections that keep you engaged and motivated.  The abs workout is concise and the short warm up and cool down sections pull the whole thing together nicely.  Its a great value for the price too!",1359504000,,595,4.422018348623853
2154828,4,B00030A5J8,"Gilad is so positive without being cheesy. This is great for me because I used to love good old fashioned step workouts in the 90s. I LOVE the beach scene with all the frolicking vacationers in the background, very inspiring to keep going. It is very basic as far as movements go so it shouldnt be too tough if you are totally new to step. Yes it is slightly dated, but the Hawaiin scene more than makes up for it. I give it 4 stars just because it lacks a bit of origionality in step moves,but it's not too big of a deal. Gets me out of the grey Washington duldrums.",1359417600,,567,4.117117117117117

2154831,4,B00030A5J8,"This is a great low impact step workout that starts out basic and works you up to doing an intermediate routine.  The routine does get a little repetative, but the time goes by fast because it changes every 10 minutes.  I get a kick out of Gilad and the 80's style workout clothes, so as long as you can get past that aspect of the video you will get a great medium intensity workout.  Great for an early morning workout session.",1356307200,,429,4.271604938271605
2154832,3,B00030A5J8,I like the video for beginners but the problem is I'M not a beginner. I thought when reading the reviews this was a moderately complex routine but its REALLY basic. Also the music is not that great either. It does make you sweat and offers a good workout and the beach scene is nice so if you are just starting out with step or need a simple routine then this is for you but I bore easily and prefer a more complex high energy workout.,1356134400,,435,4.129411764705883

2154837,4,B00030A5J8,"I purchased this DVD a little more than a month before using it, because I was intimidated by the thought of not being able to keep up with choreography, therefore diminishing the intensity of my cardio routine. Can I just say that I'm really loving this ""Step Aerobics"" dvd? It's good enough for beginners like me, and doesn't have the major complicated moves that advanced step videos feature. Don't get me wrong though... Gilad does incorpate moves that I had to pay attention to and do a few times before feeling comfortable and being able to get through them more smoothly.  After 5-minutes into the first workout, I was almost dripping with sweat. Also, I found that Gilad has a comprehensive way of building up the moves by first focusing on feet, then body, then arms (or arms, then body). I started out the first night doing the first combination from entire workout. Each combination is 10-mins. So, I did the first combo and found that I stumbled a bit toward the end of it, so I then repeated it. Once I felt better about doing the first combo, then I moved on and did a few minutes of the second combo. Altogether, I probably did 25-mins on that night using this method. The second night, I did all of combo 1, and then did combo 2 twice to feel comfortable with that choreography. So far, I've only done 2 combos,but I feel great! Like I'm on my way to being able to follow the vid for the entire 40-mins. This is only the second day that I've used this dvd, and I have to say that I look forward to doing it almost daily now! I love it! This DVD has turned me into a step aerobics fan as well as a fan of Gilad!",1341878400,8,1626,4.313725490196078
2154838,4,B00030A5J8,"ok, i workout alot....like 5 days a week.  i do cardio and weight training and have done step aerobics before however, i grew weary of doing the same machines at the health club time and time again.  i wanted something that i could do at home that was familiar yet challenging...this is where the tape comes in.  at first, i was like, geez.. this is TOO EASY.  i was not sweating and found myself even lifting my arms above my head when gilad said to put them on your waist.  after like 20 minutes, i was kinda bored THEN... he became a maniac and put all those moves together and punch, wave, cabbbage patch, swing and do bicep curls all the while stepping in upbeat continuous movements.  i started to pant.  i just knew the last combo would be the last but NO!!!  he just kept going.  when was the 40 minutes over?  it had to be soon.  i jsut kept stepping while my blouse turned from pink to red (from sweat, not blood).  i was exhausted after the 40 minutes.  this was a good workout and easy to follow but geez...this WAS a challenge.

2154841,5,B00030A5J8,Twenty years ago in high school I used to tape Gilad on VHS to work out to. I loved him then and still do. I haven't worked out in over a year but enjoyed gym step classes so I thought I would try his because of past experience with his aerobic tapes.  He does not disappoint.  It is a top notch work-out. You can do as little or as much as you can handle. He is very thorough in the instruction which keeps you motivated and on course. Obviously the look is dated but the exercise still does the trick. Thanks Gilad.,1335052800,,517,4.0588235294117645
2154842,2,B00030A5J8,the quality of the CD was bad.  About middle ways into the CD it begins to freeze and skip.  I thought it was my player but I put it into two other players and it done the same thing in the same spot.  I could not finish the work out.  So for me this was not a good buy.,1333929600,,270,3.5254237288135593
2154843,4,B00030A5J8,"This video is like taking a time machine back to the 90's!  That said, it's a great workout.  Very basic in choreography but challenging.  I like Gilad's no-nonsense approach to working out and amassed a collection of his VHS tapes over the years.  I recently found my Reebok step out in the barn, cleaned it up and decided to get some new DVD's.  I am glad I got this one -- it is fun, features a great location, Gilad offers good cuing and motivation without being overboard.

Beware, however, that the video quality is lacking and it looks less-than-great on a 60"" HD TV.  However, I decided not to focus on that (or the dated attire) and enjoyed it very much!  Looking forward to working it into my regular workout routine!",1332806400,,727,4.4961832061068705
2154844,5,B00030A5J8,"WHEW!!! What a workout.  I love this DVD because it reminds me of my step classes at the Y back in the 90's.  Gilad is easy to follow and the routines really make me work up a sweat.  If I need more intensity, I sometimes will use some hand weights.  If you are 50ish and remember what the ""old school"" step classes were like, you will love this DVD too.",1332460800,,354,4.014285714285714

2154846,4,B00030A5J8,"This is my second Gilad DVD. I wanted a workout that included no weights.  This one offers some good sweat inducing step aerobic exercises.  It is great for a quick workout (I only have 45 mins three times a week on weekdays), as you can easily cut out some exercises as you see fit.  A little outdated in the clothing department..the woman in the black outfit wears those pantyhose thingies that keep wrinkling  up and it is some ugly. It was distracting at first but by now I have managed to block it out of  my mind.  This workout is a bit fast paced and there are not a lot of reps for each set of exercises.  It was a bit hard to follow at first, but like anything else we do in life, repetition will improve memory.  Gilad does state in the DVD that this is a workout for body and mind. I'm getting up there in years so I appreciate the combination of mental and physical challenges.  That's what keeps us young longer.",1330560000,,925,4.24

The aerobics portion is broken up into four ten-minute routines that allow you to do however much or little you want (I never do the warmup or the cooldown...just my preference.) Gilad is also not nearly as annoying as some who work way too hard to be chipper. My wife and I do this routine more than others because its simple to follow but rigorous enough to give you a good workout.,1329868800,,465,4.482352941176471

Yes you either like Gilad or you don't...I've been working out with Gilad for 16 years so I am a fan.

Gilad sets a pace that is a bit fast for a beginner, however I slowed it down and can follow along perfectly. It's nice to have an option of either speed. I like that he calls out his moves in advance of doing it, (so you don't get behind) and has a clear, strong voice. I broke my hip a year ago and can't do a lot of other forms of workouts.  This makes my legs stronger, helps my breathing and oxygenation, strengthens my arms, and helps my balance.  Last, it's filmed on one of my favorite beaches.

The issue I had with that game, is that the steps don't seem flow into each other.  I decided to give this a try based on other reviews on this site, and for me, they were 100% correct.  I love this DVD and it REALLY makes me sweat more then I thought I would.  This DVD is broken up into a warm-up, 4 aerobic programs (I am only doing the first right now), a 6 minute ab workout and a cool down.  I love the ab workout as it is different versions of crunches.  I am not a sit-up or crunch kind of guy, but his direction makes me power through the pain.  All in all, I would say I love this DVD and would recommend this to anyone wanting to get into step aerobics.",1308268800,,766,3.935064935064935

Gilad's instruction is great and timing is wonderful.  I wonder if he is doing anything more current?",1306195200,,348,4.134328358208955
2154869,5,B00030A5J8,"This is a fun, comprehensive 1-hour workout dvd recorded in stunning Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. I've done other step aerobics videos and this one takes the cake (minus the fat)!

Gilad, a world-class fitness expert, starts you off with warm-up stretches, basic, then choreographed steps x3 versions leading to ""power jumps"", and finally to abdominal work and cool-down stretches.

I also recommend using a longer stepper for greater range of motion. If you want even more intensity and lose more calories, add more risers underneath the stepper, kick your legs and knees higher, do more repeaters, and extend, extend, extend your legs and arms in every move.

Buy this dvd. It's worth every penny!",1302998400,,693,5.115044247787611
2154870,5,B00030A5J8,"I consider myself an intermediate/advanced aerobics stepper. I found the step exercise in this DVD relatively easy to follow. There is a warm up segment, 40-min aerobics segment, 6-min abdominal segment, and cool down. The 40-min aerobic segment is broken down into 4 smaller segments, with the 4th segment consisting of all the steps in the first 3 segments. There was only one very small part of the exercise that required me to have my side facing the TV, but I could still see the TV screen. Gilad does not show the steps at a slow tempo, so if you are new to step, it might not be easy to follow the exercises. I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and I'm planning to get another Gilad Step aerobics DVD.",1302307200,,701,4.484375
2154871,5,B00030A5J8,"When we moved 4 years ago, we never rejoined a gym and I have really been missing Step Aerobics classes.  I tried to find shows to DVR and there just seemed to be so few for Step even on Exercise TV. (We have little kids too so working out is always the first thing to get cut from my daily list.)

So, I ordered this Gilad video for $10 figuring it was worth a shot.  And,I have to say that I really love it!  It is dated (probably mid-90's), but if you can get past that, it is a good work out to do at home.  He does start out very basic and builds with each session (there are 4).  I do it at 5:00 a.m. prior to work so the slow build is great at waking me up.  And I am defintely sweating by the end.  He is also very good at cueing what is coming next so it is very easy to follow.

I would recommend to old Steppers and new.  It is not quite like going to a Step class at the gym, but it fills the bill for now.  It is easy enough to follow if you are just starting, but is a good enough work out if you are looking for a Step routine to do at home.",1299715200,,1056,3.690582959641256

Gilad has a very barky and annoying voice and I could barely even watch it let alone do it. I am sure it is a good workout if his voice doesnt put you off, but the steps are so incredibly basic. His voice so obtrusive and unattractive - I couldn't stand to listen to it. It might be half okay with the sound off but even then, you would need to not want any sort of challenge with your stepping moves.",1267920000,10,497,3.98

He doesn't stop and have a drink of water or pick up objects; - this is how it should be.  Its challenging, but not impossible.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that there will be a time when you may want to move on to something more difficult - and when Gilad develops it, that will be the 5.",1266624000,,426,3.976470588235294

I am not new to step aerobics, but I am an occasional exerciser. The warm up and cool down are in separate segments. The 40 minutes of step aerobics are broken down into four 10 minute segments. As a result, when you first start out you can specifically choose the warm up and cool down segments along with one to four 10 minute aerobic segment(s). I like this flexibility, especially when I first started and could not do 40 minutes of aerobics.

I highly recommend this dvd.",1262476800,,618,4.5675675675675675

The moves weren't complex but you can make them intense with bench height and hopping for high intensity.  I'm in pretty good shape and this workout makes me sweat by the end and leaves me breathless.  Sometimes I mix this by starting out with Gilad's 30 minutes fat burning aerobic workout then doing the last two sections of this tape for step.

Obviously with doing this workout about 3 times a week, you'll eventually get used to it and increase the time until you get til the end. Overall I liked it.",1252713600,,461,4.191011235955056

I just push play, while I am trying to convince myself to get up and exercise, and by the time Gilad has taken a short scenic motorcycle ride on the Island, I have decided that I am ready to step.

2154904,4,B00030A5J8,"Overall, this is a great step DVD.  I am not graceful on my feet to say the least, and I had minimal difficulty performing all the moves.  There are 3 sections - beginner, intermediate, and advanced, which helps to break it up into sections based on skill.  But if you are an advanced stepper, you will probably find yourself bored with the first 2 sections, and probably not have a great workout from doing only the advanced piece.  But all three sections flow into each other nicely, and you never stop moving...he switches segments by having you ""step up, step down"", and that's how the next segment will start.  Gilad works each move off a previous one by adding an extra kick, bend, or lunge...so that helps to keep me coordinated.

I agree with other reviewers that say he warns you of a change in step before it happens, and he's consistent about it.  You have plenty of notice, and it's not in a distracting way.  Also, his counting is never off that I have noticed.  And for me, I really need that because otherwise I'll be all messed up.  Although the steps themselves are relatively simple, the way Gilad combines them is quite challenging, as you still work a great sweat.  There is an ab section at the end which is great.  And I think it's only 6 minutes long, but it's definitely a great workout - you WILL feel the burn.

If this is the only exercise DVD you own, you will be quite bored.  I didn't initially find it boring, as I like that it's set on the beach in Hawaii.  But after I started doing this DVD, and only this DVD, 3-4 times a week, it was too repetitive.  However, if you change it up with another one, it's great!  I recommend this DVD for beginner to intermediate steppers only.  It is equally great for both, and it really helps to move the beginners to intermediate status quickly.  Advanced steppers may be bored by only doing the advanced section, but if you just want a quick 8-10 routine and add the abs, you may be satisfied when using this as a ""switch it up"".",1239580800,4,2001,4.388586956521739
2154905,4,B00030A5J8,"I have been doing step-aerobics for years and consider myself an intermediate-advanced fitness level, and I was looking for a new challenging step workout. Gilad did not disappoint! The moves are very athletic, no hopping around or ""dancy"" type moves. He is also an excellent cuer, so you know what move is coming next. This video is also good because it gives you about 40 minutes of good, hard step, followed by about a 7 minute effective ab section. The warm up is very good and the only reason I didn't give the tape the full 5 stars was because the cool down could have been a little longer. I work out with a 10-12 inch bench height and this tape will get you sweating. As with any step tape, the intensity of the work-out can be adjusted based on how high your bench is. Highly recommended!!",1236902400,2,798,4.4353741496598635

He doesn't even call the steps until you are about to miss them.  Even a couple of the helpers were stepping wrong since he would wait so long to tell you what to do.  I am mad I bought it.  I will not use it again.,1236556800,9,377,3.6375

But all the 80's jargon throughout the video is way too much.

I do the entire routine low-impact and I sweat buckets when I'm done. That makes me feel good 'coz it's telling me I've accomplished something.

Gilad does a great job building on the steps so you don't get bored and keeps increasing the intensity without complicated steps.  He reminds you of the next step so you don't get lost.  Some of the other instructors go right into the next move without giving you any warning.

I really like this DVD. It is dated and a bit hokey, but Gilad is enthusiastic, the directions are good, and the scenic background is fun. If you're a rank newbie, you will need to roll back the DVD here and there. Or you can just fake your way through the routine -- you're at home, you can go ""left"" when they're going ""right"" without embarrassment. I worked up quite a sweat, and I run almost every day, but I also chose to do everything Gilad told me to do.

I wish the music were a bit more interesting. I wouldn't do this routine every day, because I'd get bored. But I do admit I ran this DVD on my home office PC and kept CNN on my office TV... my bad... if you have any significant step experience you can multitask during this DVD.

For the price, you can't go wrong. I plan to buy some old favorites, such as Kathy Smith, but this is a fun DVD that belongs in most exercise collections.",1211068800,,1152,4.15695067264574

I am very uncoordinated when it comes to feet/arms but picked up on his moves very easily back when I started.  Picking it back up this time was like riding a bike!  I have great fun everytime!  I pick and choose different parts to work out to because time doesn't always allow to do the entire thing.  Yes the attire is dated but trust me, that doesn't matter.  It makes it a little comical.

I have made a hobby out of building a collection of step aerobics workouts and resisted Gilad's DVD for awhile.  Once I did buy it, the DVD quickly became one of my favorites.

Gilad's warm-up routine is among the best in workout videos and my personal favorite.  It's low impact, but gets you moving right away.  The step routines are very athletic and very repetitive.  Personally, I like repetition because it allows me to focus on getting the most out of each movement (squeezing my muscles, keeping the abs in, standing tall).  There's enough variety, though, to keep you interested and enough movement to keep you energized.  But my favorite part about the step routines is that every time I do this workout, I feel challenged because of the athleticism required.

In addition to the very relaxing cool down, there's a separate ab workout that's a nice addition.

I like Gilad as an instructor.  His cues are excellent and I find him motivating.

Here's a weird thing that creeps me out, though.  The two female steppers in the video are wearing some weird support hose that bags up in a strange way.  I know it's an incredibly dumb thing to notice, but I have to admit it's something I think about every time I consider doing this workout!",1170374400,56,1354,4.658227848101266

He's outgoing without being over the top and he's a good instructor.  He keeps the routine fresh by changing the steps often, but it's not too hard that you won't be able to keep up.  The choreography isn't too complex.  There is the usual pivots, knee lifts and taps etc so if you are already an experienced stepper, you'll have this down in no time.  His setting here is stunning - Waikiki.  That in itself is motivating.

8035584,5,B00030A5J8,Brings back good memories!  Love step aerobics and Gilad!  He's a motivator. Had this on VHS but they're obsolete. Glad to find this on DVD. Highly recommend this video!,1518307200,,169,4.793103448275862
8035585,5,B00030A5J8,"Gilads Workouts are timeless! While the routines in this video are a challenge to learn, once you get the hang of it its a great workout. They are fun and also mentally challenging. He spends time teaching three ~20 minute routines, which increase in complexity. The fourth session puts the previous three routines youve learned altogether. You will be pouring sweat by the end of the fourth session. Its an oldie but goodie!",1517443200,,425,4.835616438356165
8035586,5,B00030A5J8,I was skeptical since this video was made in the 80s and its now 2017. It actually is a really good workout video. Intense and I like the actual just step aerobics and not all the other crazy burpees and other things that being pregnant I just cant do right now. Ive also bought other videos now if Gilad that I like as well. The music isn't dated sounding. Actually if it weren't for their clothes you couldn't tell it was made in the 80s. Would recommend this step video.,1512086400,,473,4.266666666666667
