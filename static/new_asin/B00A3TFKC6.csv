5381442,3,B00A3TFKC6,"I had done a little barre work before buying this dvd, so this dvd seemed a little beginner. I would recommend this to anyone who has not tried barre workouts.",1406332800,4,159,4.333333333333333
5381443,5,B00A3TFKC6,I watched this on fast forward all the way through once before trying it and I thought it was going to be too easy- even for me-but man was I wrong!  it was very challenging.  I recommend it.  it's a very challenging workout for your legs and core.,1397433600,12,248,4.125
5381444,5,B00A3TFKC6,"I first bought the regular Burn at the Barre and even at the lowest level of the three shown, I had trouble keeping up. I've never been a big dancer (I took a six-week ballet/tap class when I was 7 and at the end, the teacher took my mother aside and said, ""Maybe you want to find her another activity that's better suited to her."") but I always admired them. Figured I'd try a barre workout because they looked fun. BATB IS fun, but again, found it a little beyond my ability level, probably because of my lack of familiarity with dance and dance terminology. Plus, the regular BATB moves VERY fast (at least for me) and I can't get anywhere near the extension range that the ladies on the screen can. I have a hard time ""going at my own pace"" when the people on the screen are going faster (something about the competitor in me, I want to keep up). But I loved the instructors and the style of the workout, so I was happy to find this.

It is much shorter - right around 29 minutes - and you need a chair/barre and a set of light hand weights. There are only two ""levels"" shown (rather than the three in the regular BATB video), beginner and intermediate, and the beginner is very basic. Even though there is not a LOT of instruction, the two demonstrators are easy to see and it's easy to figure out what they're doing. The other instructor walks back and forth between the demonstrators, pointing out examples of good form and reminding you to keep your pelvis tucked or toes pointed or how to breathe during the exercise.

They run through exercises for the whole body, starting with a warm-up: leg lifts to front and side, a pedal jog, calf raises with parallel feet and with turned-out feet, small plie squats, hip circles, stretches, a pelvic tuck series, some more plies, and then a held plie with a small knee movement. Then they move on to glutes (standing, one leg bent backwards at 90 degrees, and leg pushes back in pulses; then to side, pulsing; then alternating back-side-back-side; stretch leg out to about where 5 o'clock on a clock face would be, and do small lifts/squeezes, and then the glutes are stretched with one leg on chair or in a figure-four stretch holding on to the barre (or chair). This is then repeated on the other leg. The standing leg/glute is getting just as much work here as the ""working"" leg!

Then there's some leg work, with inner thigh pulses, then front pulses, which are repeated on the other side. Most of these leg movements are small (""up an inch, back an inch"") which makes them more concentrated and makes it easier to focus on form.

Ab series: performed standing, the body bends and squeezes at the core, with arms lifted and then kept level with the head as the head bends (one arm at a time, the other on the chair), and then you return to standing. This is repeated a few times, but like Pilates-type moves, you only need a handful of reps to make a difference.

More leg work: demi-plie holds with small movements of knees or heels, followed by a well-earned stretch.

Then you pick up hand weights and work the arms/back/shoulders: start by holding the weights with the palms of both hands side by side, face up (like you would hold a platter), with elbows at right angles to the body. Then move each hand away from the other until the hands are out at your sides, then pull hands back to original position (repeated several times). This is followed by simple bicep curls, and then a shoulder move, reaching your hands out in front and pulling them in. Drop one weight and do tricep kickbacks with one arm, then straight-arm pulses up, then small circles one direction and the other direction, trying to keep your hand right over where your back pocket would be (this is a killer). Repeat other side and then stretch the arms.

This is followed by some deep breaths, a forward bend with rollup, then some more general stretches.

The entire workout is done standing (for people who hate floor work). Aside from the tricep section, I was able to do (or at least attempt) all of the exercises at the ""intermediate"" level shown. Since I'm what I'd call an experienced beginner, I think this video is a great place to start for people who have never tried barre routines. There are combinations of familiar moves and more ballet-inspired moves. I like barre work because, as I said before, I've never really been the picture of grace, and I feel almost graceful when I'm doing this DVD. If you are an advanced beginner or have done barre or ballet-inspired dance workouts before, go ahead and get the regular BATB video -- you'll find this one too easy. Even though I was doing a lot of the Intermediate level work, I still feel like I could spend time using this video to perfect the moves and my form to get more out of it.

I have a history of back problems (2 herniated discs that won't go away, one in my lower back and one in my neck) and I appreciated the instructor's specific recommendations for modifications for less strain on the lower back. I also have fibromyalgia, and I can say that this was an energy-producing or energy-neutral workout, not an energy-sucking workout (other fibromites know what I mean :) )",1396483200,30,5178,4.511727078891258
5381445,4,B00A3TFKC6,"I hate working my legs but it is the area where I carry my weight! I have a problematic knee so normally Barre workouts would not be my thing. I decided to give this one a try after reviewing it on Youtube. I was able to do it but I wrapped my knee as an extra safety measure. There is one woman using a Bar and another using a chair. The chair user is doing all the modifications. The instructor is very motivating and likable. I think the DVD is a bit over priced especially since its only 30 minutes and offers just one workout. There are a few others for Beginners that are priced lower and have more to offer by qualified instructors. The next day my thighs were sore in a good way, tells me that I worked them well!",1389139200,20,721,4.084507042253521
5381446,5,B00A3TFKC6,Great video for my 50+ body that hasn't exercised in several years due to elder care exhaustion. All of the exercises are actual barre/chair exercises or arm exercises that you do standing up with weights or water bottles. I used the ankle weights I already had and just wrapped them around my hands. I was able to do the beginner options and a few of the advanced options since I bought a barre and I'm not constrained by the chair. I look forward to working up to the advanced options.,1384819200,19,487,4.4222222222222225
5381447,5,B00A3TFKC6,"I fell in love with this DVD the first time I used it.  It is rather short..30 minutes or so...but still will make you break a sweat and be a little sore the next day.  The moves are very easy to follow, and no difficult footwork to keep up with.

Would highly recommend Barre, and this DVD!",1379289600,24,291,4.0701754385964914
5381448,5,B00A3TFKC6,My husband and I both tried this DVD and felt GREAT afterwards and the next day.  It isn't exhausting and the exercises were do-able even by total ballet beginners like us!  We didn't know all the terminology but could pick up what the two demonstrators were doing.  One deonstrated using a portable barre and the other just used a chair back like we did.  We have our calendar marked to do this DVD the same day every month.,1368230400,23,425,4.410256410256411
8546509,5,B00A3TFKC6,Definitely helping me. Use it to catch on easier in my Barre Class.,1520208000,,67,4.230769230769231
8546510,1,B00A3TFKC6,"There is no excitement or sense of fun in this tough workout. More of a boot camp style but with non-energizing music or dialog. The set was tiny and uninspiring...as if it were filmed in a closet. 1 star because it is a tough workout, definitely not for beginners.",1508371200,,265,4.428571428571429
8546511,4,B00A3TFKC6,"I purchased this dvd along with another one, booty barre beginners and beyond, by Tracy Malett.  This one is great for beginners or those just starting to work out.  I couldn't get through the bootybarre dvd, it was too difficult for my current level of athleticism, which is walking a few days a week.  This dvd has two models providing different levels of difficulty, the bootybarre did as well, however it was still too much, this one was much easier but still felt the burn and I could complete it.  There are stretches between the more difficult exercise movements which allows for a little break / breather.  I didn't give it five stars because, I would have liked there to be a basic instructional video that goes into more detail about each position, movement.  The other DVD I mentioned had this and it was very helpful in ensuring I was doing the exercises/positions correctly.",1485475200,,887,4.7272727272727275
8546512,5,B00A3TFKC6,Great dvd. Very east to follow wonderful if you are a beginner with Barre method and need to learn moves at a slower pace,1483747200,,121,4.083333333333333

8546517,5,B00A3TFKC6,"This is a wonderful beginner workout.  Dr. Trumbull is a clear and caring instructor.  One lady does the exercises for an able bodied person, and the other lady does the exercises for someone who is slightly disabled.  I found this very helpful.  These are exercises I can actually do on my barre.",1433116800,3,297,4.653846153846154
