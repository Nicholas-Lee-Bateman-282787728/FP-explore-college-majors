2127475,5,B0002VR6PY,"As a child, our daughter always loved the Carol Burnett Show.  We gave this to her for Christmas & she loved it!  It contains 2 complete shows & she thought it was great.  She loved reminiscencing with her family as they all watched it together!",1168300800,5,245,4.4
2127476,5,B0002VR6PY,"The legendary Carol Curnett and her cohorts are at their comical best. The Pointer Sisters sing ""Save The Bones For Henry Jones"" and they play the wicked stepsisters in the rock opera ""Cinderella Gets It On"". A classic!! June Pointer is out sick during this show so Anita, Bonnie and Ruth Pointer carry on without her.",1119916800,3,318,4.696428571428571
2127477,1,B0002VR6PY,"I haven't bought the set and thanks to these reviews i won't, but it is interesting that the top rated reviews sound like a commercial for the DVD's. Wonder who wrote them??",1294444800,2,173,4.4375
2127478,5,B0002VR6PY,"The first of the two episodes includes one of the funniest bits Conway ever did... and that's saying a lot! He plays a Nazi interrogator with Harvey Korman as his boss. It's hilarious! The second episode has a ""Mrs. Wiggins"" sketch, which is funny in its own way. The DVD is almost worth it just for these two items!",1293235200,,316,4.372881355932203
2127479,1,B0002VR6PY,"I was very disappointed to discover there were only two episodes on each DVD.  Since I am a Canadian consumer I paid more than my American counterpart, and it worked out to about $17.00 per episode, which is very disappointing.  I was under the imnpression that I was going to receive the first 5 seasons of the show with every epsiode. This is a real rip off and the way it's advertised is very misleading.  I don't recommend the purchase unless you or someone you know is a huge fan and you're willing to pay much more than it's worth.",1292803200,8,537,4.35
2127480,1,B0002VR6PY,If Carol chose the shows to be on each DVD she should have done a better job.  The shows on this one were awful.  There was nothing funny except the Mr. Tudball segment and the musical segment was very flat.  Save your money here.,1270944000,4,230,4.181818181818182
2127481,5,B0002VR6PY,"From 1976: Actor Jack Klugman (of TV's ""Odd Couple"" fame) is the guest. Included: A tiny escrow office space is made more crowded with the addition of a new worker (Tim); Carol & Jack in a musical-comedy ""battle of the sexes""; a sketch about a seemingly one-way communication marriage (Carol, Tim); a clairvoyant (Harvey) makes predictions at a small gathering, delighting some (Carol, Vicki), and bitterly disappointing others (Jack); a Pink Panther-like physical comedy bit with Tim as an inept jewel thief; and a musical-comedy finale about old-time politics.
From 1975: The wonderfully talented Pointer Sisters (sans sister June) are the guests. Included: The show's annual montage of commercial spoofs; the Pointers sing ""Save the Bones for Henry Jones""; a senator (Tim) continually disrupts his running mate's (Harvey) political speech with food, drink & cigar; at a restaurant, a woman (Carol) tries to convince her friend (Vicki) that she's constantly ignored (which ends with an elaborate sight gag); and the Pointers play the stepsisters in the finale ""Cinderella Gets It On"", a hip, funky version of the fairy tale (Tim as ""Elfin John"" & Harvey in his ""yentl"" get-up as the Fairy Godmother are a real hoot!).
This volume is made especially valuable & poignant with the passing of Pointer Sister June, who died of lung cancer in 2006.",1262563200,,1344,5.141552511415525
2127482,2,B0002VR6PY,Each DVD has only two episodes of the show.  Don't know if that is worth the cost.,1257033600,16,82,3.823529411764706
2127483,5,B0002VR6PY,"Show #1: From 1974...Eydie Gorme & semi-regular Tim Conway. The show includes a montage paying homage to certain songs hilariously; a mousy woman (Carol) at a carnival whose predictions from a fortuneteller (Vicki) come literally true in front of her; a ""quickie"" with Lyle & Vicki as detectives crashing Harvey's party to unmask a killer; and a musical climax with Carol & Eydie.
Show #2: From 1976...First-time guest, the terrific Joanne Woodward. This show includes two traditional sketches. A ""family"" sketch has Eunice hanging out with an old friend (Woodward) who raises the ire of both Ed & Mama (Harvey & Vicki); and a Wiggins/Tudball sketch have the boss (Tim) hopelessly trying to organize his dumb secretary (Carol) for an important meeting. Also: A sketch with a wealthy couple (Harvey & Vicki) using their servants (Carol & Tim)as ""go-betweens"" during dinner; Carol & Joanne as wallflowers at a dance in a musical-comedy bit; and Carol, Vicki & Joanne in the musical climax.
Both shows have great bits in them, and it's particularly good to see the great actress Woodward enjoying herself here.",1250294400,5,1107,5.087912087912088
2127484,5,B0002VR6PY,"Both shows were aired in March of 1978, the show's final season (sans Harvey Korman). But what a guest line-up!!
Show #1 has the irrepressible Steve Martin (at the height of his stand-up comedy popularity) & the very talented Betty White. The show starts off with another chapter of the ridiculous soap ""As The Stomach Turns"". This time, it has an extraterrestrial twist as they spoof ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""...complete with a doorbell chiming the familiar alien greeting & Steve Martin playing ""Richard Dryface"". Carol's daughter Vicki Lawrence returns with an alien baby (with antennae, no less!). And guess who's the father? Tim Conway, hilarious as a bulbous-headed, silver-skinned alien! Hysterical! Speaking of hysterical, Martin does a comedy routine...for dogs only, dredging up every old dog joke imaginable. The ""Family"" sketch returns as Eunice begs well-to-do & selfish sister Ellen (White) to take Mama (Lawrence) off her hands for good. There's a park bench sketch with Carol & Tim. Then, the shows wraps up with ""Beach Blanket Boo-Boo"", a funny-cheesy musical-comedy tribute to all those funny-cheesy 60's beach party movies.
Show #2 has not two but three great guests. James Garner, George Carlin & returning guest Ken Berry make for a diversely entertaining show. Included: A sketch about group therapy which comes completely unraveled; Carlin pitching an irreverent off-the-wall offer (""Every Song Made Collection""); Berry & Lawrence in a song & dance bit; Carol & Garner as lovers saying an absurdly ""long goodbye""; Carlin as a dental patient at the mercy of the assistant (his bitter ex-wife); and a musical finale with ""street musicians"" Carol & Berry. A recurring sketch throughout the show has a long-suffering construction worker (Conway) finding different ways to murder his annoying pinhead of a wife (Carol)...and each one backfires hilariously.
With the passing of comedy legend Carlin, plus the wonderful range of guest talent, this volume is a definite keeper!",1246924800,6,2003,5.321766561514195
2127485,3,B0002VR6PY,"This CD set was fairly pricey, and i expected to see a ""best of"" format, with sketches and other memorable moments plucked from shows.  But this gives you the entire hour long show - the songs, the dances. etc.  Some of this is boring, and you just fast forward thru it.  You do get to see some decent guest stars, and tim conway and harvey are great, as is carol.  Would have been better to just have the sketches on there.",1238457600,34,424,4.197530864197531

8033336,5,B0002VR6PY,"I love The Carol Burnett Show, and ""Went With The Wind""
Is easily one of the funniest shows she ever did.  It's a true Classic, and a must have for anyone who loves her work.  They just don't make
Shows like this anymore. And that's a real shame.",1393545600,,246,4.104166666666667

8033339,5,B0002VR6PY,"Carol lasted for many years on television becaue she was so entertaining. Hard work, talent, and great guest stars helped also. Rock Hudson was one of the best.",1362873600,,160,4.75
8033340,5,B0002VR6PY,"This excellent VHS tape has 2 of my favorite episodes of The Carol Burnett Show. We get the show with ""Went with the Wind,"" a hilarious spoof of `Gone with the Wind;"" and the other show features the very first ""Family"" sketch with Vicki Lawrence playing Mama--and The Jackson 5! The quality of the print is excellent all the way through.

Both episodes are on one tape. In the first episode from 1976, here's just some of what you'll see: Dinah Shore guest stars and sings ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."" Harvey Korman and Tim Conway do a comedy sketch about a man in a hurry who must stop at a butcher shop run by an elderly fellow who doesn't exactly move too fast; and just about the entire cast appears in ""Went with the Wind."" ""Went with the Wind"" is hilarious; it's easily worth the price of admission all by itself; and the costume sight gag when Carol walks down the staircase gets me laughing every time! Other pieces include a humorous skit in which Carol and Harvey meet at lunch to discuss the possibility of marriage--in purely business terms.

The other episode, from March 1974, features Roddy McDowell as the guest star and it has just as much to offer. We see Roddy come on stage with his makeup on to play the part of an ape; there's even a brief film that shows just how hard it must have been for Roddy to sit through makeup. Roddy also plays the incredibly successful baby brother of the working-class family in the first ""Family"" skit performed on the show. This episode also guest stars The Jackson 5; they perform ""Dancing Machine."" The comedy skit with them as students of ""The Glendale Music School"" is outstanding, thanks in part to an actual earthquake that happened during taping which inspired some improvised and sidesplitting lines by Carol Burnett. I'm sure you'll laugh when you see it!

And there's more where all that came from!

I highly recommend this for any fan of Carol Burnett, the actors in these two installments of her show and people who enjoy first-rate comedy.",1345075200,2,2007,4.582172701949861
8033341,5,B0002VR6PY,This video includes the hilarious spoof on Gone With The Wind.  A classic - as funny today as it was back when it first aired.  I loved it!  Thanks Amazon for making this available for sale.,1307318400,,190,4.222222222222222
