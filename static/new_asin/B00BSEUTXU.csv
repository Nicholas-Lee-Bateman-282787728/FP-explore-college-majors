8573282,2,B00BSEUTXU,"I know it was 3 movies in 1, but I hoped it would be reversed CDs or 3 separate discs. Putting all 3 on 1 disc lowered the quality of the movies significantly making them look very cheap and fuzzy. Then there was no option for English subtitles. Love bollywood, but am unable to speak their language. Makes it very hard to enjoy the movies.",1382400000,,340,4.246153846153846
