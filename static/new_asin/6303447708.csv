7847568,4,6303447708,"I ENJOYED THIS PRODUCTION. OF ICE SKATING THIS IS MY ONLY WAY TO RESPOND TO A MOST DISMAL CALENDAR THAT IS AT LEAST HALF ,THE TIME  FAILING TO PICTURE ,THE ABUNDANT BEAUTY OF MY BIRTHPLACE, HAWAII

MY REVIEW HERE IS FOR A WALL CALENDAR FROM CAFE PRESS ,BATCH1060/41/CHARLIE.  DEC 2016
I PAID $37.  I HAVE NOT USED IT, IT IS MORE THAN DISAPPOINTING.  HALF THE  PICTURES OF HAWAII .AN ORIGINAL,DESIGN ARE NOT ANYTHING I WANT  ON MY WALL.  IT IS HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE CHOSE THESE PHOTOS FOR A CALENDAR.  THE BEAUTY OF HAWAII IS NOT PICTURED HERE.  THIE PICTURES ARE MOSTLY WHAT I WOULXD HAVE DELETED FROM MY CAMERA.

  I NEEDED TO ,RETURN IT AND DIDN'T DO SO.  IT IS NOT WORTH $1 TO ME.
THE FREE CALENDARS OF KITTENS AND PEOPLE ARE MORE ENGAGING AND WORTHWHILE TO ME.",1465344000,,785,4.361111111111111
