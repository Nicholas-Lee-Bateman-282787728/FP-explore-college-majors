8275095,5,B0019ROEQ4,"Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the space of 2 days & quite surprised to see no reviews here. Having started watching on a whim, I was taken in by the best use of pause, restraint & employment of 'negative space' I've ever seen. The sheer density of humor can a be complex at times; as Mr Lee says to the audience: ""you'll need to raise your game"". Also, knowing a little bit about British culture is a significant help. The comedy approach here is understated & almost quiet compared to typical American standup. Perhaps as a result, it is the only standup I recall getting better with repeat viewings.",1449878400,,619,4.486725663716814
