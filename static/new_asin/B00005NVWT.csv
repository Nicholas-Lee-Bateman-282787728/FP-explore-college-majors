I wondered what it could offer us. We were pleased to find that ""FOTW"" found two cool American kids leading quite different lives, both of which interested our viewing audience (family, students, kids, and adults, some of whom were from foreign countries).

Kyle's family farms a homestead that has been in his family since they helped settle the frontier in North Dakota. Three generations live on the farm and share in all the work. They live near a tiny village that seemed like another world to our kids. Is it possible for a town to be so small, and in the middle of all that wide-open space? They were fascinated. We talked about how North Dakota is often considered one of the best places to live in America (as is Delaware), but has a smaller population than Delaware, where Kristin (the city dweller in this video) lives.

Kristin lives in Wilmington, the biggest city in the First State. She's busy with lots of activities after school and with her family, and she lives in a vibrant city that few people know much about. Comparing and contrasting the lives of these two kids was interesting for the folks we watched this video with. My friend's adult ESL students enjoyed the narration, which was in children's voices and was easy for them to follow.

For clips of Kyle's and Kristin's life, visit YouTube and search for ""Families of the USA (Families of the World),"" and choose ""Rural Trailer"" and ""Urban Trailer."" The additional materials that are included are a teacher's guide with a transcript, activities, and background material (including a recipe for pancakes!), and worksheets and quizzes for ESL students, available through the video distrbitor for free online. A very cool video in a first-rate series.",1290556800,,1874,4.813664596273292
7947874,5,B00005NVWT,"I thought J. Hall's review was useful and on point, though a bit preoccupied with the status of the two families whose lives are shown in *Families of Ghana.* This series---part of the *Families of the World* programs about elementary- and middle-school-aged kids from many countries---makes every effort to be representative and fair to each country and culture it profiles. I think this video is no exception.
The kids who watched this video with me had questions about the differences between our lives in the States and those of Deborah and Emmanuel, but they were savvy enough to pick up on some of the concerns that J. Hall had. Maybe that's why I can give this review a rating of 5 out of 5 stars with confidence. I think the story lines work.

I enjoyed learning about Deborah and Emmanuel's lives, and so did the other folks who watched this video with me. Some of the videos in this series might show the lives of families that are more ""average"" than others, but I've found each video to be engaging, fun, informative, and equally engrossing for others who've enjoyed them with me. And the quality of the video production is first rate, which is not always the case with videos designed with educational purposes in mind. They are also a treat for my ESL students, both adults and kids, because the narration is easy to follow and clearly tied to what the viewer is seeing.

If you want to watch clips of each part of this video, go to YouTube and search for ""Families of Ghana (Families of the World)---Rural Trailer"" (to learn about Deborah's life) and ""Urban Trailer"" (to learn about Emmanuel's).",1289865600,2,1610,4.6855123674911665

Arrived promptly and in excellent condition.",1268092800,2,168,5.461538461538462
7947877,5,B00005NVWT,"My 11 years old daughter and I just love ""Families of..."" series!  We especially love more exotic titles of the series, where you are introduced to lifestyle and customs very different from our own.  We watch the library video over and over again, and now I'm ready to buy my own copy!",1236297600,,285,4.461538461538462
7947878,5,B00005NVWT,"I have used this video in my elementary school Spanish classes for the last four years.  It shows a balanced view of life in Mexico; the life of a middle class girl and that of a girl who lives in the country and whose family does not have much money.  Two videos are included on the cassette. Each one begins with a girl getting up in the morning.  We see them have breakfast, take showers (one of them with well water), go to school, the average day. Besides being fascinating to my students, the most important aspect of this film is that it makes no judgment about people, rich or poor.  It comes highly recommended by this viewer.",1129075200,3,635,4.3559322033898304
7947879,4,B00005NVWT,"I have a hearing problem or this would probably be 5 stars.

I think this is an excellent example of teaching kids about how other people live.  Besides that, I enjoyed it!

Since I have access to them, I'm planning to look at a few more.
