2381163,2,B000AA4F2E,"Inspired by Nintendo's smash hit video game, the Legend of Zelda cartoon was blocked together with a Super Mario Bros. cartoon as well, but unlike that animated series, Zelda had little going for it.  These thirteen episodes (roughly about 10-15 minutes each) revolve around heroic Link defending the often attacked kingdom of Hyrule from the evil Ganon.  In between, Link also defends Hyrule's reigning princess Zelda, from whom he attempts to steal a kiss from.  Now I know that this is aimed towards kids, but even when I was a kid I didn't like this show, and watching it now, I can see it for the pure idiotic camp fest that it really is.  The animation is stiff (and why do Link, Zelda, and everyone else have elf ears?), the voice acting is atrocious, and the show isn't even remotely entertaining.  This three disc DVD set is worth a look for those who enjoyed the series, but only a look.  With 13 relatively short episodes, why space them out (along with the little features included here) on 3 discs?  This set is a rip-off, and if you are considering purchasing it, wait until it's at a much cheaper price.",1130284800,3,1118,4.5879396984924625
2381164,5,B000AA4F2E,"How can you get a kid up at 5:30am? Put on a syndicated cartoon show with video game characters, that's how!

Each episode is 15 minutes in length because the original show was part of Captain N and the video game masters. Each morning you'd get a different line-up, of either a Mario Bros episode, Legend of Zelda, or Captain N (which combined several games.)

This is an item best for total Zelda nuts (deku-nuts) who watched the cartoon as a child. It's typical of every Saturday morning cartoon show, somewhat removed from the source material (understandably) although it does include video game sound effects.

Link is characterized as a rather narcissistic young man with an attitude, which might annoy some people.

2381166,5,B000AA4F2E,"FINALLY! After years of trying to download the episodes form online and having no such luck, they will be released on DVD! I have been a fan of the Zelda series since it first came out. My mother and I used to pa it together when I was really young and I looked forward to  the Mario Brothers show every Friday to watch Zelda! A shame there were only  13 episodes tho! Although the cartoons are a bit childish I STILL find them highly entertaining. Each show is about 15 minutes long. Like previous reviews state, it has NOT been released yet. I have seen all of the episodes tho and am HIGHLY anticipating this release. I give it six stars - one for good luck =}

2381224,3,B000AA4F2E,"Look...  this is a dopey, tacky, and even pretty crappy cartoon series.  It's animation ranges from decent to cheap, the voice acting can be obnoxious as hell (""Hey!  Ex-cuuuuusssseeee me, princess!""), the writing is shoddy and sup-par, and it doesn't quite capture the sense of adventure of the video game series that inspired it.

HOWEVER...  in my opinion, this is still a must-see for ""Zelda"" fans, and is well-worth owning, even if just for the novelty/collector factor it brings about.  It's definitely amusing to watch in retrospect to see how silly it all is, and it can have a nice nostalgic touch for fans who grew up watching it and Nintento's other animated series.

My Final Verdict:  If you love the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  Sure, your eyes will be rolling constantly and you might let out an audible groan here and there from the poor writing and production.  But the nostalgia and ""so bad, it's kinda good"" charm make it worth owning for hardcore franchise fans.  (Though non-""Zelda""-fans need not apply.)",1424908800,3,1062,4.844444444444444

2381298,5,B000AA4F2E,"When I was just a teenager, I remember watching the Super Mario Bros. Super Show back in 1989.  Every Monday through Thursday, they would air the live action segments of Mario & Luigi (plus a handful of guest celebrities -- remember Sgt. Slaughter, anyone?!), followed by the SMB cartoon episodes.  But on Fridays, it was all about The Legend Of Zelda.

I love a lot of the voice acting, particularly from Paulina Gillis.  (She voices Princess Toadstool on SMB Super Show, SMB3 and Super Mario World and even guest-starred on Episode #166 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 80's/90's cartoon franchise.)  Sadly, because the show was run in tandem with the SMB Super Show, there are only 13 episodes, yet there is still some great quality to be found here.  I especially love the soundtrack and how it was delightfully incorporated from the NES video game (most notably, when the Tektites kidnap Zelda or Ganon causes Hyrule Castle to sink).

Now I am going to list each episode with a brief description, so enjoy!!  :)

""The Ringer"" -- Ganon makes his debut.  He enlists a quartet of Stalfos to bring him to Hyrule Castle, where he plans on stealing the Triforce of Wisdom.  It's up to Link and Zelda to stop him!

""Cold Spells"" -- Link pretends to be sick in order to get out of doing chores for Zelda.  Ganon casts a spell on Sprite the Fairy.  When she casts a spell on her cleaning supplies, her magic goes completely awry, causing damage to Zelda's room.  Ganon also makes another attempt to steal the Triforce.  Link and Zelda somehow wind up in Ganon's evil jar and are forced to kill his servant, Gohma the arachnid.

""The White Knight"" -- Link fails to rescue Zelda from a huge Octorok, so enter a white knight!  He not only kills the Octorok, but is invited to Hyrule Castle.  However, the darker side about the prince is soon revealed when a bevy of Tektites (spider creatures) and a Zola kidnap Zelda and bring her to a swamp.

""Kiss 'N' Tell"" -- When Link rescues a maiden from the three headed Gleeok (Dragon), she kisses Link, but it turns him into a frog!!  :(  To make matters worse, the ""damsel"" is actually a Gibdo (Mummy) in disguise!  Ganon captures Zelda, and it's up to Link to get his original bodily form back!

""Sing For The Unicorn"" -- Ganon uses a magical unicorn to kidnap Zelda's father, the King of Hyrule.  Ganon then osses the king into a pit room.  Meanwhile, Link and Zelda have to figure out why the unicorn is so significant to Ganon in the first place.  Their answer is soon revealed when they come across a female ninja.

""That Sinking Feeling"" -- This is my first of two favorite episodes.  A bunch of Tektites ruin a picnic for Link and Zelda.  After Link disposes of them, Ganon uses an underworld magnet to cause Hyrule Castle to sink -- WITH Sprite and the King of Hyrule inside of it!!  :(

""Doppelganger"" -- Ganon makes a duplicate of Zelda.  The doppelganger has the REAL Zelda kidnapped by Moblins.  When Link comes across the ""fake"" Zelda, he takes her and the Triforce of Wisdom to Ganon's Castle so that he can rescue the TRUE Zelda.

""Underworld Connections"" -- A trio of Ganon's bats go to Hyrule Castle to steal the Triforce -- by blowing it up into three large pieces.  Link and Zelda have to enter Ganon's castle to find the missing Triforce pieces.

""Stinging A Stinger"" -- A shrewd elf suckers Link into giving up his magical sword.  When a trio of Patras comes after Zelda, Link fails to stop them when his ""fake"" sword breaks!  And to add insult to injury, Ganon kidnaps both of the heroes and places them into a dungeon cell, where they are forced to tangle with a large Gohma!  :(

""A Hitch In The Works"" -- Ganon once again uses his Moblins to kidnap Zelda.  He places a jewel control device on her neck which forces her to obey him in every way -- including marrying him.  WHAT?!  :(

""Fairies In The Spring"" -- When the King of Hyrule orders his men to build an amusement water park, they come across a bunch of live water monsters and are forced to retreat.  It's up to Link and Zelda to find out whom is causing this mayhem -- and for once, it's actually NOT Ganon that's behind it!!

""The Missing Link"" -- Ganon and his minions launch an all-out assault on Hyrule Castle.  When he tries to aim a fireball at Zelda, she deflects it (by using the Triforce) and the fireball accidentally hits Link, causing him to -- gulp! -- disappear!!  :(  However, Link isn't actually killed; the fireball caused him to turn into a ghost, so he can't touch anything, including his own magical sword!

""The Moblins Are Revolting"" -- this is my second favorite episode of the entire bunch.  Tired of Ganon's berating and belittling, the Moblins and Goriyas take matters into their own hands by encasing Ganon inside of a bubble and sending him into a bottomless pit.  The minions then decide to launch a full scale assault on Hyrule Castle.  However, things don't exactly go according to the letter...

Although the final episode did leave a cliffhanger much to be desired, Link and Zelda do make cameo appearances in another cartoon series -- Captain N:  The Game Master.  In fact, they are actually featured in THREE of the episodes!

So before I sign off, I will now recite the following:  ""Well excuse ME, princess!!!""  :)",1404172800,,5277,4.53927813163482

In the show, Link and Princess Zelda live in a castle and they both protect the Kingdom of Hyrule from the evil Ganon. Ganon often tries to steal the Triforce Of Wisdom, or kidnap Zelda in order to get the Triforce for ransom. This boxset contains all 13 episodes of the show.

I love that Link and Zelda are both quite powerful in this show and they both know how to fight. Link uses his sword and shield, and Zelda uses the Triforce Of Wisdom, a bow, a boomerang, and sometimes she uses Link's sword.

I can't help but get nostalgic when I watch it. This is a great show every zelda fan should see, the only complaint I have is it didn't have all the Super Mario Bros. Super Show!!! opening segments, well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me shoutbox!!!!!! (sorry had to do it) so this is why it only gets 4 stars. I'd recommend the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! as well.",1294963200,4,1037,4.457894736842105

2381416,1,B000AA4F2E,"I rememerd back in the fall of 1989, when Nintendo was larger then life. So to capitalize on the Nintendo craze was to make a Ninetendo after school cartoon show. The Super Mario BROS. Super Show. Syndicated on weekday afternoons somewhere between 3-5 PM in the states. The show starts off for a bout 10 minutes of a live action sitcom of Mario and Luigi having misadventures in their  basement apartment in Brooklyn,NY.In the center of the show they have a cartoon show about 15 minues long. Monday-Thursday it was the Super Mario Bros.,which was a blast to watch. And on Fridays was the Legend of Zelda. Which I REALLY hated. I was introduced to the Nintendo Entertainment system a year befoe the show. With games like Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda. I was a BIG LOZ fan, and was excited with anticipation of a LOZ cartoon show. Well,it was a HUGH letdown. Because I Found the characters Link and Zelda really repulsive. Link in this series is a immature,horney,teenage,doofus. And Princes Zelda is a houghty,stuck,teenage snob b*tch of a princess. This is NOT how I want Link and Princess zelda to be portrayed in this utter BLASPHEMY!!!!Before the show debut I've always pictured Link as a kind,strong,valiant,brave and selfless warrior that wouldn't be dessperate to neck out Princess Zelda. And even sacrifice himself in the name of the Kingdom of Hyrule. And I pictured Princess Zelda to be understaning,and pretty much the opposite of everything on what I  worte above. The only character they got right is Gannon. If I remembered correctly another reviewer asked how on Earth Nintendo could let this filth be animated. What I want to know is how did LOZ creator Shigeru Miyomoto felt if he ever saw this trash?!I know that Miyomoto dosen't read  and speak english very well. But what if Miyomoto read in japeness subtitles when Link says to Princess Zelda ""Well excuuuuuuse meeee. Princess!!''.I wonder if he would cringe at it. Let alone HOW this filth got passed through him. I suppose  this was aimed to be a kid's comdey cartoon for 6-9 year olds. I was 9 when the LOZ catoon show came out. And I didn't find it funny. If you want to see really good LOZ cartoons--read the LOZ manga graphic novels by Akira Himekawa. These manga graphic novels portray how Link and Princess Zelda are supposed to be as i worte above. And not this filthy blasphemy. I would have given this DVD set 0 stars if Amazon let me have the option.",1281312000,4,2448,4.699300699300699

Never in all of Legend of Zelda gaming history has Link expressed ANY romantic interest in Zelda, WHATSOEVER. Also I'm looking at the front of the box cover to this DVD set right now...why does Link has light brown hair and a stern expression on his face? In other words, looking almost like the REAL Link? In the cartoon series, the fake Link (I'm calling him fake) had dark, black hair and most of the time a goofy, surfer dude expression on that mug of his. Guess they really want to sell this DVD set, so make the front box cover look almost like the real Link. Ugh...I hate the 80's now more than ever, thinking about this cartoon. 80's...R.I.P. (or not.

Some lines are corny, but we laugh with it. We like zelda eenough to laugh with the old cartoon. So ""excuuuse me"" for liking the cartoon, being a zelda fan that I am.

2381447,1,B000AA4F2E,"I bought this box set to give this series a second chance. Unfortunately, I found the series as dissapointing as I had when I was a child watching this on television.
  The show is quite funny, has Zelda for the most part being the boomerang-wielding heroine, though it isn't very serious as it is known the target audience is 6-9 year olds.
  The only reason I would recommend against this purchase is for the shows portrayl of Link. As a child playing the Legend of Zelda on the old NES system, it was unplesant to see our ""Legendary Green Hatted Hero"" as a semi plump, snort laughing, perverse womanizer with the tagline ""Excuse me, Princess!""
  This is a great buy if you're looking for some laughs and nostalgia, but if you're a hard core Zelda fan who has never seen this, and expect it to be a serious action show, you'll be in for a huge dissapointment.",1229385600,3,861,4.452229299363057

2381471,3,B000AA4F2E,"Whether this series is ""good"" or ""bad"" really depends on who you are. While some series are, normally, considered awesome, and others are usually considered terrible, the Zelda series splits fans right down the middle. If you hail from the generation raised on 80s and early 90s cartoons, and fondly remember your Saturday-morning animation overdoses, you'll probably like this. The characters, while keeping close to their original game designs, are rendered with the clothing, hair styles, and common animation style from the 80s. It also possesses the more basic, standard plots from 80s action cartoons, though there is a lot more attempted kissing. :P If you loved the show, or other basic cartoons from it's time, then sure, get it!

Now, if you are a big fan of the games, especially Ocarnia or Twilight Princess, it starts to get shifty. If you love the games for the plot and characters, you may not like this show. If you love how silent and gentle, but strong, Link is, I can almost promise you will hate the show. Link is -very different- in the animated series. He is headstrong, talks quite a bit, and has a more ""aggressive"" personality (aggressive as in, he's more persistent about what he wants). A lot of fans like this version of Link, so I don't want to berate him, but he is almost a polar opposite to the standard, game Link. Remember, this show was made long before the very popular titles, such as Ocarnia and even Link to the Past! The show is based on the very early games. If you were raised on the later 90s and even cartoons from the 2000s, you will certainly notice the age of the animation. While it is detailed and very colorful, it is also older.
However, I do know several fans who are exceptions. There are people who either didn't watch 80s cartoons, or love the recent games, or even prefer high definition stuff, who still like this series. As I said, you can go either way.

As for my experience: the show introduced me to the Zelda world when I was about 4. I thought the show was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. The plots were easy for me to understand, and I thought they were really great. I didn't watch the show again, until I was 17. Upon that second viewing of the show, I had played tons of Zelda games, and loved them for their plots and characters (the gameplay and music, too, but that doesn't so much apply here. ;) ) This time, the show just made me laugh. It was almost like watching a parody of Legend of Zelda. Now that I'm older, I prefer deeper, more thoughtful plots, so it makes sense that the Zelda show plots no longer interest me. But the series is good for a giggle or two, and I feel a little younger when watching it. However, these days, Zelda's attitude and Link's ""catch phrase"", ""Excuuuuuuuuseeee ME, Princess!!"" grate on my nerves somewhat. But, I have some friends who loved the show as children, and still love it now. So, as you can see, opinions can change, or they may not. It depends on the viewer.

""So!?!"" you're yelling at me now. ""Do you recommend buying this or not? Huh? Get to the point!"" Haha, no worries! Here's what I recommend:
If you remember absolutely loving the show, and have watched it in the past 5 years and still liked it, buy it if you want! But, if you haven't watched the show since you were little, or never watched the show, SAMPLE it first!! Some of the episodes are on YouTube, and even on DivX's Stage6, I believe. That way, if you find yourself disliking the show, you won't waste money. But if you do love the show, more power to you!

Thanks for reading! I rated 3 because it's an in-between opinion for me; 3 stars usually mean ""It's okay"", so that's what I took it as here.",1197244800,6,3688,4.451183431952662

Yeah, the ""Well, EX-cuuuuse me, Princess,"" is pretty annoying,but the cartoons are so awesome, who cares?
These are super fun to watch if you watched them as a child or enjoy the games. I probably wouldn't recommend this to someone unfamiliar with either.

2381474,2,B000AA4F2E,"Nintendo's ever popular LEGEND OF ZELDA videogame series could have made for an excellent cartoon/Anime series, but this '80s attempt is absolutely disastrous in every way imaginable.  The artwork reeks of Saturday morning cartoon fare, and the stories range from uninspired to totally inept (""The White Knight"", in particular, where Zelda becomes inexplicably infatuated with some bland armored prince is especially dreadful).  Furthermore, the lead characters, Link and Zelda, are neither appealing nor interesting.  He's portrayed as a perverted doofus uttering a cringeworthy ""Excuuuse me, Princess"" while she is a shallow, bitchy heroine.  When one feels no empathy for either protagonist, you know something's wrong.  A continuous running gag happens between the pair where Link tries to steal a kiss from Zelda, only to have it never happen.  Even the characterization of the series' central villain, Ganon, is disappointing; in the games he was a figure of awesome, intimidating evil, but here he's a painfully monodimensional cartoon baddie with zero substance.  There are many other things wrong with this series as well:  the editing and the direction of a majority of the action sequences is very choppy, with lots of obvious errors.  It's almost as if the creators did not have a good knowledge of the characters or the enemies from the game.  The only thing this series does right is in retaining some classic NES sound effects and familiar musical scores, but otherwise, even diehard ZELDA fans are likely to cringe at the overall results of this travesty.",1194048000,3,1571,5.2730923694779115

2381529,4,B000AA4F2E,"excellent product, i always remembered this show fondly because it was on after school on fridays, i would watch the Legend of Zelda and not have to worry about doing homework. the rest of the week mario was on, which i loved, but LOZ was a weekly special occasion.

the reason i gave it four stars is because 13 episodes could probably have all been fit on one disk, without the beginning and ending being played between each episode. honestly, the beginning, then each 12 or so minute episode, and then the ending credits (""Do The Mario!"")

i think the Zelda episodes with the live action sequences should just be included with the general Super Mario Super Show DVD. aside from the openning credits this series is self containing and one DVD would cost less than three. there are a few sketches of the characters which can downloaded, which is nice, but any extras could have been fitted on a separate disk, and as i said, i really don't see the need for the mario live action sequences in this particular DVD.

that being said; this DVD was made with collectors in mind, you won't be dissapointed, i highly recommend this. i also have a bunch of the comic books, so this DVD is highly prized, and i stopped enjoying Zelda as soon as super nintendo came out. this is link at his oldest (still he seems to be a teenager) and is based entirely on the first and second games. in fact, it is canonical with the comics. this DVD can be placed between Zelda II and the comic books. Zelda has been awakened and uses a bow and arrow to fight, but link has not yet identified with having the triforce of courage. a great show for collectors, or anyone who loves mythology (unless they love myth and hate children's cartoons). i would rank this cartoon as less cheezy than He-Man, but more cheezy then X-Men The Animated Series, however, unlike either of those cartoons, this one is *never boring*!! well, the the repitition of the beginning and ending credits are boring and unnesesary, but that's already been mentioned.

highly recommended.",1151798400,5,2036,4.6005509641873275
2381530,3,B000AA4F2E,"First of all, I want to say that it is truely awesome to finally have this on DVD. I was a huge fan of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show when I was a kid, and I always looked forward to Frisdays for the Zelda episodes.

The Zelda cartoons, themselves, are a lot of fun. Granted, they are a little silly and could even be considered 'cheesey' from a certain point of view, but they are what they are. They may not come across as serious as some of the video games (i.e. Ocarania of Time), but this is perfect for something targeted at kids. I was 9 when this show came out, and I loved it. And I love looking back on it now.

If I were rating just the cartoons, in-and-of themselves, and not the DVD as a whole, I would give it 5 stars.

But, as you've probably noticed, I only gave it three stars. And I have reasoning behind this.

I just picked this DVD up earlier this week as well as the recently released boxed set of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.

The SMBSS set is the first in a series of box sets that will collect all of the non-Zelda episodes of the series. There are 24 episodes on that 4-disc set, complete with all live action segments and all cartoons (it even has the previews for the Zelda episodes).

Having bought that at the same time, I found it very disapointing that all of the complete live-action segments were not included on this Zelda release (only a handful of episodes include them). Being that I am kind of a 'completist' and wanted to have the whole 'Super Show' series in as complete of a manner as possible, I found this to be a let down.

Personally, I would have much prefered if the SMBSS set had also included the Zelda episodes complete with live-action degments, and this particular Zelda set had just been a separate release for people who only want the Zelda series, and don't care about the live action stuff or the Mario cartoons. I would have liked to have all of the episodes in order, but could have dealt with separate releases if all the live action stuff had remained intact.

If you are someone who is only interested in the Zelda cartoon, and don't care about the rest, then this will be right up your alley.

If you are a completist like me, you will be at least somewhat disapointed.

However, even after taking acceptance of what content is included on this set, it still seems silly that the thing is 3  discs and costs as much as it does. During the Super Show episodes, the cartoon segements only accounted for about half of the running time, with the live action stuff being the other half. Since this only mostly includes the cartoons parts with only a few exceptions, there is no reason that this shouldn't be a 2-disc set and about 5 to 10 dollars cheaper.

It costs about the same as the SMBSS set, which is 24 complete episodes on 4 discs. This is only 13 (mostly) partial episodes when taking the live-action stuff into account. They seem to be trying to give it the appearance that you are getting more than you truely are. And it is extra disapointing since both releases are put out by the same distributor.

So, its up to each individual to decide if it is worth their money. I just wanted to put the info out there of what exactly is included in this set to not give anyone false hopes (particularly anyone who may have already bought the SMBSS set and not this one). It's certainly not a bad buy, and I do not regret buying it, but it won't fully satisfy the completists out there.",1144800000,68,3454,4.319938176197836
2381531,5,B000AA4F2E,"This is a great set.  Not many extras, but definitely worth the price.  You even get a few of the live-action ""The Super Mario Bros. Super Show"" episodes, which make the cartoons look a whole lot better.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase.  Now they just need to release the complete series of ""Captain N: The Game Master.""",1142985600,5,333,4.593220338983051

I could have just waited and gotten the super mario supershow in its entirty which would have included the zelda animated series.  as far as quality of the cartoon, eh, not so hot, but hey, 80's cartoons were all pretty rough.  still a good buy if you're a die hard nintendo fan.  oh, and there are previews in the begining for heathcliff and punky bruster dvd collections, if your into the whole I love the 80's thing.",1141862400,2,608,4.2155172413793105
2381533,5,B000AA4F2E,"The Legend of Zelda is a great cartoon show! The Legend of Zelda: The complete animated series is great DVD set! Thirteen episodes of the cartoon show exist.  In 1989, this series was part of the Super Mario Bros. Super show, and the episodes aired on every Friday.  The characters of Link, Princess Zelda, and the Evil Wizard Ganon are the main characters of the series. Link is like Robin Hood with a sword, and Princess Zelda is like a real princess but she can do much more. Link and Princess Zelda have a wondeful sense of humor/ romance that is essential to the series. This cartoon show is really good because you know the animation is done by the Japanese and the stories and characters match the Nintendo game perfectly! I like this series a-lot!",1140739200,10,755,4.544117647058823
2381534,5,B000AA4F2E,"This was a fantastic DVD collection. I have been trying for years to get copies of this as Any Video Gamer would like and all copies were terrible.

This is a fantastic collection of the Saturday morning Cartoon Series ""The Legend Of Zelda"" and even if you are not a Nintendo Fan you will want this collection for your Video Gaming collection",1138579200,3,342,4.516129032258065
2381535,5,B000AA4F2E,"The Legend of Zelda: Complete Animated Series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children's cartoon should be, right there with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" ""Street Sharks,"" and ""Recess."" The Legend of Zelda was (and still is) such an exceptional video game series for all ages, and the TV show followed in its footsteps. It combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one-liners, and some jokes that still today make me laugh. ""Lookin' good, Princess! 'Specially from THIS angle!"" As children we see Link yell that to Zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences. But later, that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee, and wonder how we ever missed it before.

But the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series. The implimentation of original 8-bit sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more. And waiting to see which classic Zelda enemy will cause Link and Zelda trouble next is just that much more fun (especially if you can name them).

But by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when Link can coax a kiss out of the lovely Princess. And they've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted. Link tries so hard, and makes such an idiot out of himself trying, that you'd think he deserves a little action once in a while. but every time, no matter how he tries, he either messes up or is interrupted by Ganon's non-stop attempts to steal the Triforce.

All in all, if you grew up with te Super Mario Super Show, and you're a Nintendo fan, you'll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it.",1138492800,16,1746,4.554140127388535
2381536,5,B000AA4F2E,"This has the Super Mario Super Show opening theme on it.. That alone makes it worth it.

The show itself is hilariously bad, but that's what makes it so great. Good for nostalgia if you ever saw this show on TV.

2381537,3,B000AA4F2E,"Here it is!  DIC's atrocious television representation of one Video Game's most revered franchises just as I remembered it.  Once aired on Fridays as part of the Super Mario Brother Super Show in 1989, this DVD has all the bad animation, 8-bit Nintendo sound effects, cheesy dialogue, and THE LIVE action OPENING for the show with Captain Lou Albano dancing like an idiot.  It also has a few nice extras such as the character design sheets and some of the live action skits with Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Well as Luigi.

I wouldn't recommend this DVD to gamers, anime fans, and/or Zelda purists as members of these groups would be SORELY disappointed.
But if you were still in grade school in 1989 like I was and allocated 30-minutes every Friday for this show, then you probably had some fond memories in which case $20 bucks for some nostalgia might just well be worth it.",1137283200,3,878,4.608974358974359
2381538,5,B000AA4F2E,"After school every Friday,this was IT!The thing every kid who loved Nintendo did;watch The Legend of Zelda!! Yeah,all kids watched cartoons after school,and everyone (at least us boys anyway) thought the Super Mario Bros. Super Show along with  the Ninja Turtles were the coolest shows ever in the late 80s.

But there was just something extra special about Zelda!

Maybe because we considered Zelda more serious than Super Mario Bros;because being able to beat all nine labyrinths and save Princess Zelda was quite a feat at ten years old. Maybe because as a boy,we all dreamed about going on adventures and fighting monsters like Link did. It was always really cool to see what Zelda,Link and even Gannon would be like if they were real and we could look into their lives. Gannon also made such a better villain than Bowser did.

Watching the show again over 15 years later makes me realize how much of the show I did not appreciate as a kid. The humor of the mixed up romance triangle with Link,Zelda and Sprite. Link always trying to get a kiss from Zelda,Zelda for the most part brushing Link off,Sprite in love with Link and jealous of Zelda

but Link not interested in Sprite. Probabally the dialouge that made me laugh the most was this one:

Link:""You're a girl Sprite,how can I get Zelda to like me?""

Sprite:(high pitched fairy voice)""Who cares!? Zelda's a snot!""

It would have been great if more episodes were made of this series,but at least we will always have the memories. The only thing I didn't like about this set,is that every episode also opens up with the Super Mario Bros. Super Show opening instead of just the Zelda opening. But that's what fast forward is for.

On the plus side,seeing Lou Albano ridiculously dressed up and dancing around like an idiot singing ""Do the Mario!"" is perhaps one of the greatest moments in human stupidity that should be preserved for life. All in all terrific fun! Any gamer who grew up in the 80s should definitly buy this!",1132012800,5,1982,4.688760806916426

Of course, I missed many episodes on the ""first run.""

I was hoping I could find the Zelda cartoons when that internet movie streaming company that starts with an N and ends in an x optioned Super Mario...  Alas- my hopes were dashed.

When I saw this on Amazon, I first thought that the price was too high, but after building up a few prime no rush shipping credits, it seemed more worthwhile, now I just need to figure out how to save it for eternity...
