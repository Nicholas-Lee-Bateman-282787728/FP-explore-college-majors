I LOVE THE GUN IS LOADED AND I LOVE THIS, TOO.  YES, WOMAN POSSESS SO MUCH POWER OVER MEN.  AND COURTNEY LOVE COULD NOT HOLD A CANDLE TO LYDIA LUNCH.  I UNDERSTAND HER FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE COMPARISON..  LYDIA IS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE WITH A BOLD ATTITUDE.  SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT",1340409600,2,549,4.281553398058253
