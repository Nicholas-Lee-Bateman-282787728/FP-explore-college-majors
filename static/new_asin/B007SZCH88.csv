Yes, there are moments where you can see this is a low budget movie but putting that aside I genuinely had a great time watching it.  I've seen plenty of bigger budget films where I didn't laugh half as much as I did watching this.  One of my favorite parts has to be the relationship between Mitch and Larry, classic!.  And the fact that they sprinkle in some slapstick here and there is a welcome touch.  So, If you love comedies and don't mind that this isn't some Hollywood budgeted affair, you will love ""The Big Idea"".",1334188800,,619,4.482142857142857
