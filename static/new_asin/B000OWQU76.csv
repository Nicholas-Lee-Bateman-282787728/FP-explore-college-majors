8187024,5,B000OWQU76,"While this work has been superceded by Mr Janich's newer material on ""Blade Concepts"", this is still far more worthwhile than many other CDs that cover the same topic.  Look for Mr Janich's other titles if you are serious about blade or empty hand defense.  Its top of the line by a very serious professional.",1335312000,,309,4.6
8187025,5,B000OWQU76,"This video is not for begginers, its complicated and has very advanced moves. If you are looking for a begginers fighting video, this is not for you.",1334534400,,149,4.555555555555555
8187026,3,B000OWQU76,"This is the second part of the series. If you are looking for something to start with, get ""Fighting Folders"", the first one instead. Then decide if Mr. Janich's techniques are right for you. He sure knows his knives, but I found many of his techniques too complicated for practical purposes. (ring finger knife opening in a critical situation anyone?) I much prefer to go through Kelly McCanns KEM-'BA-TIV KNIFE first, and then get back to the ""Fighting Folders"" series for entertainment.",1324598400,3,489,4.975609756097561
8187027,5,B000OWQU76,"Michael Janich is well know in the blade arts community.  He was a U.S. Army Special Forces soldier and a knife instructor.  This two volume set covers all aspects of using the folding knife for street combat.  This dvd set covers how to choose a folder, where to carry a folder, how to draw and open a folder, techniques of using the knife and numerous knife drills.  Mr. Janich has developed a simple five angle system and shows how to practice various knife drills.

 My only complaint with this (as well as many other knife handling books and videos) excellent dvd is that it shows too many knife drill exercises.  Nevertheless, if you are into the blade arts, the Knife DVD set is for you.

Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Knife Handling and Knife Defense for Police Officers officer).",1263945600,5,804,4.6453900709219855
