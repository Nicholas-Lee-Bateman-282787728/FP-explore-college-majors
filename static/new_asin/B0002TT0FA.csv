2119918,2,B0002TT0FA,"Although it is a decent production, any appeal is lost here with no chapter breaks to frame the events in this huge historical review. ""Remarkable 20th Century..."" becomes a tedious beast to manuver through, unless you intend to watch each decade/chapter all the way through, and who does that with a reference production like this? You'll navigate to a topic,fast-forwarding/rewinding much as you would have with a VHS format...so the technological advantages of the DVD format are lost. As a reference, considering that lack of any index... not only as a menu item, but no clues on the packaging either, these discs become even more mysterious, ponderous, and disappointing. For a user-friendly reference to 20th Century milestones, buy the Madacy product, and steer clear of this one unless you collect these sorts of things!",1166054400,7,828,5.186567164179104

8031774,5,B0002TT0FA,"Great transaction but as a teacher was disapointed in the series, its good for history buffs but not a high school classroom.",1405728000,,125,4.7272727272727275
8031775,1,B0002TT0FA,"If you're looking for an excellent documentary covering the 20th century, choose The Century:  America's Time hosted by Peter Jennings.  This set will bore you to tears, and the narrator is not close to dynamic.",1319155200,,211,5.0
8031776,2,B0002TT0FA,"This DVD's have too much information and not enough information on the most important happenings of the 20th Century.  If you want to use these for a teaching aide, I would not recommend them.  Instead, look into The Century: America's Time with Peter Jennings.  He doesn't cover everything, but explains in detail how WWI and WWII affected the world; the depression; the newest happenings with the newest inventions, etc.  His is very well done.",1280966400,,446,4.986486486486487
8031777,5,B0002TT0FA,"I am really impressed with the series narrated by Howard K. Smith. This presentation takes several disciplines and places them in the proper decades.  This is not just a history of war or presidents but also of technology and fashion.

I'm not a fan of sound bite presentations read have five people and you rotate the room over and over and over again instead of concentrating on one person telling a total story. However, this presentation lends itself perfectly to such a presentation.

Many of the facts that you hear about and read about in the 20th century seem isolated and have no relevance to other things happening. However, this series puts them in perspective.  You know what is actually happening in 1936, instead of just the Olympics you know when amendments were made to the Constitution not just why.  You get a new perspective on presidents and wars.

You may not want to take the whole series and in one viewing but it is possible.",1259366400,2,949,4.686746987951807
8031778,4,B0002TT0FA,"This was a very educational and informative series of documents.  Howard K. Smith was the appropriate one to make the presentations.  I would highly recommend this series for the history major.

8031779,4,B0002TT0FA,"While the host leaves a lot to look at, his synopsis is consice, presice, and delivered articulately.  The images and video are delivered well and in an excellent chronology to help understand the issues of the periods.  The video delves into the cultural, political, economic and technological aspects of the time period.",1211241600,,322,5.173076923076923
8031780,4,B0002TT0FA,"This program is an excellent overview of the twentieth century. About one hour is devoted to each decade where all the major political events, social uphevals, scientific discoveries and major artists are mentioned. Includes plenty of interviews. Highly recommended and a good value for money.",1200960000,,293,5.533333333333333
8031781,2,B0002TT0FA,"We ordered 13 copies of this item to give away as gifts. The one we listened to had quality problems on a couple of the DVD's, so now we don't know whether to give them as gifts or not. It is not nearly as good as the Peter Jennings one, but then that one is a lot more expensive too.",1195603200,,284,3.75
8031782,5,B0002TT0FA,Great for all history buffs.,1168819200,,28,4.8
8031783,4,B0002TT0FA,"POSITIVE: The BEST I've seen on DVD as far as comprensive content and detail-wise.

NEGATIVE: It is difficult to navagate to specific sections of interest because it's lacking a good scene selection feature.

That's an important DVD feature for me.",1168473600,,248,5.175
