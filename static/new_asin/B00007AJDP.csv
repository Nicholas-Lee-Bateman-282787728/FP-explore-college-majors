7975331,5,B00007AJDP,"United Artists presents ""FOOL'S GOLD"" (31 January 1947) (63 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- One of the most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman --- continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made --- based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential --- the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word --- the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since --- your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment --- Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play -- outstanding role model.

Hats off and thanks to Les Adams (collector/guideslines for character identification), Chuck Anderson (Webmaster: The Old Corral/B-Westerns. Com), Boyd Magers (Western Clippings), Bobby J. Copeland (author of ""Trail Talk""), Rhonda Lemons (Empire Publishing Inc) and Bob Nareau (author of ""The Real Bob Steele"") as they have rekindled my interest once again for B-Westerns and Serials --- If you're into the memories of B-Westerns with high drama, this is the one you've been anxiously waiting for --- please stand up and take a bow --- all my heroes have been cowboys!

7975333,4,B00007AJDP,"In November 1983, in what was the biggest heist in Britain's history to date, gold bullion worth 26 million pounds sterling was stolen from a security warehouse in London.  Fool's Gold, a 1992 British LWT film starring Sean Bean (Sharpe, Essex Boys, Extremely Dangerous, Bravo Two Zero, Lady Chatterley), tells the story of the heist and, more to the point, of what happened afterward.
The theft was committed by a ruthless, brutal gang of career criminals orchestrated and lead by Micky McAvoy (Bean).  By way of background, McAvoy was a workhorse for a group whom I can only describe as British mafia.  He aspired to strike out on his own--to run his own show, so to speak--and decided on the security warehouse for his maiden heist.  Though the theft is a matter of public record, I don't wish to reveal too much about the characters or the repercussions for those unfamiliar with events.  Suffice it to say that these were small-time crooks and it was McAvoy's first job as head man--and it was a pure coincidence that the Brinks-Mat gold happened to be in the warehouse the weekend of the robbery.  As a result, McAvoy finds himself faced with an even bigger problem than the theft:  What does one do with 26 million in marked gold?
The film is 104 minutes, and special features on the DVD include a Profile of Sean Bean and Daring Heists of the Twentieth Century, both of which are text-based.  As for the film itself, like most British productions it benefits enormously from repeated viewings, and I found I got a lot more out of it (and hence enjoyed it far more) the second time around.  The story is well told and the film impeccably cast.  Bean (donning a Cockney accent here) excels in roles that require strong characters (be they good guys or bad ones), and his performance here is flawless.  Worth mentioning is Trevor Byfield's absolutely splendid portrayal of McAvoy's best friend Jimmy Kimpton (the only major character who, though based on a real person, was fictional).  He's a man on the horns of dilemma throughout.
In conclusion, this is a story about a brutal and daring theft, but it is also a tale in which the mettle of loyalty and honour among thieves are tested against one of the basest motivators, that being greed.  I would recommend this film to fans the true crime genre in general, or to fans of Sean Bean in particular.  If, for example, you've enjoyed Bean's other hard-edged films dealing with life in the underworld of gangsters--films like Essex Boys or Extremely Dangerous--you'll likely enjoy this one.",1066867200,38,2545,4.754545454545455
