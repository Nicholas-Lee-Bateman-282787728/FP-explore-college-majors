5047152,1,B0071BY2EG,"This is without doubt the worst movie ever made and Vincent D'Onofrio should be sentence to life in prison for making this utterly boring, incoherent, annoying piece of crap. If Aliens saw this movie, they would no doubt destroy Earth because this movie is man as its lowest form of intelligence, You suck Vincent D'Onofrio",1345334400,3,323,4.890909090909091
5047153,1,B0071BY2EG,"This film defies logic -- in every sense of the word! If not the worst film ever made, certainly in the top 10. This film is an example on how NOT to make a film -- any film! I scarcely know where to begin. The music, singing, acting, directing, story, and dialogue, are all simply awful. People getting killed (albeit most off-screen), those you do see receiving bloodshed, are almost always singing as they are being killed. Right, someone is stabbing you to death and your still belting out a tune while blood pours out. It staggers the mind how truly poor this film was. Thank goodness I saw it free on cable. I should have known that when I saw this mess was written and directed by Vincent D'Onofrio (lead detective on Law & Order: Criminal Intent) it was going to be bad. He was laughable on ""Criminal Intent"", and he brought his lack of skills to this abomination of a movie. Why were people getting killed? Who was doing all the killing? Who knows? Who cares! The writing was that pitiful. The only reedeming value of this movie was when you saw the credits role at that end. That is when you knew, the 1 hour and 28 minutes you lost watching this dog of a film was finally over. Your misery was over. Take away the cussing and a few scenes, this film is easily PG-13 (almost PG). Better yet, just take the film away period.",1341964800,,1333,4.357429718875502
5047154,4,B0071BY2EG,"Worst movie ever? Bad acting? Wow, people are taking their hatred far! I could see how if you didn't like this type of music, you'd hate the movie. 90% of this movie is the music. Its not like your usual musical where people break out into song randomly...there is actually a reason for them to be singing. I personally enjoyed the music, there were some lame tunes, some funny songs, and some catchy ones. The ending was a little weak but the gore was decent. Overall I was entertained. I highly recommend checking out some music clips from this youtube before watching so you can see if this kind of music is your thing. If its not, don't bother watching. 3.5/5 stars from me.

Check out my horror movie/book review blog for a more in depth review of this movie.

*UPDATE 8/11/12* I have now seen this movie about 5 different times, and honestly, I just love it. I've updated my original 3 stars to 4. The whole reason I love this movie is the music. The overall MOVIE portion is a little weak. I've been told you aren't supposed to really KNOW what happened at the end of the movie. It seems obvious to me other then 1 particular scene, but that could be sloppy editing. I have no idea.

If you like musicals, check this out. But definitely check out YouTube for some clips of the songs before getting into this, because if you don't like the music you will hate the movie.",1341273600,4,1376,4.3882352941176475
5047155,2,B0071BY2EG,"I'm not sure exactly what D'Onofrio was going going for here, but I'm guessing it was an excuse to sit hang out in the forest and smoke a little bit. The movie has a decent foundation to build an acceptable horror/slasher flick, but on all accounts they just pissed on it. The acting isn't terrible, the music is actually really freaking good, but it lacks any kind solid story, and you can find more believable violence on daytime public TV. Vincent liked some music and wanted to do something with it, calls were made, and somewhere along the way someone squatted and this movie fell out.",1339977600,,590,4.5754716981132075
5047156,1,B0071BY2EG,This movie was absolutely terrible. Acting was horrible from the beginning.  And also from the beginning you can get a pretty good idea who the crazy one was. Totally pointless.,1339891200,3,177,4.9
5047157,1,B0071BY2EG,"-=<*>=- Possible Spoilers -=<*>=-

The movie is described as a ""slasher musical"" but we're 1 hour and 4 minutes into the movie (which is a total of 1 hour and 23 minutes long)and so far, there have only been a couple deaths, and those have been primarily off-screen. There are songs, however, just about every 5 minutes. The movie would be far more successful if that ratio were reversed. Plus, one of the main characters keeps going into this portentous monologue about hurricanes and - I think - how they're a metaphor for life or something, but it's delivered in such a monotone that it more lulls you to sleep than imparts any wisdom. Cap this all off with characters bursting into song as they are trying to warn their friends about the killer or - even worse - as they're dying - and this movie becomes just one, huge confusing mess.

I love D'Onofrio as an actor, but he kind of scares me as a director and NOT in a good way. In a interview with EW, he admitted to coming up with the idea to do the movie because he was bored. This is NOT a good reason to make a film.

The best thing about the movie as a whole is that the woods in which it was filmed are absolutely gorgeous (and, apparently, are D'Onofrio's property - I have to say, I envy the man! What I wouldn't give to have a woods of my own like that :D) Unfortunately, this isn't one of those movies that's so bad it's good or so campy that it's funny. It's plays like it's intended to be taken seriously, and it is so dreadful, the best thing one can do is to seriously avoid it.",1339718400,2,1547,4.219594594594595
5047158,5,B0071BY2EG,"Review by Ruby:  A young man takes his indie band deep into the woods for a weekend of complete solitude to find song-writing inspiration. But soon, they find they are not alone at all.
 Vincent D'Onofrio, in his feature-length directorial debut, has taken a group of non-actors and 12 days of filming in the woods, expertly mixed them, and turned it all into a little gem of a scary movie. It has all the elements of a good slasher flick:  film editing that creates a mysterious aura, creepy musical sound effects, foreshadowing, and screams and blood enough to satisfy any slasher-phile but not so much as to disconcert those of us who prefer psychological thrillers over gratuitous sadistic violence. Call it Grand Guignol for the thinking audience.
 But do not underestimate the musical part of this slasher musical.  Sam Bisbee has written a killer (pun intended) soundtrack of indie rock songs that engage as well as entertain. I'm nowhere near being a young person any more, and I was afraid the music might not be to my liking, but Bisbee writes such interesting, intelligent music with truly poetic lyrics, and the kids' voices mastered the nuances so well, I found this becoming my new favorite soundtrack. The music integrated with the images wonderfully, making a perfect blend of sight and sound.
 D'Onofrio, with his vast and versatile acting experience, did a brilliant job of casting these musicians/waiters and an even more brilliant job showing them the art of appearing totally natural on camera.
 The script was conceived and written by D'Onofrio, Bisbee, and Joe Vinciguerra. Please do not let this be their last film collaboration! Their fresh ideas and sly sense of humor melded into a thoroughly enjoyable, if violent, evening of entertainment. Tell your friends. Pass it on. Just...don't go in the woods alone.",1335744000,5,1835,4.99672131147541
5047165,4,B0071BY2EG,"First off -- It's a B-movie. It's not supposed to be judged upon the direction of Steven Spielberg or the writing of Stephen King. It's a B-movie. Judge it as such.
The plot is fair but weak at the end. The premise is the same. The acting is better than average (for B-movies; it's not Brad Pitt or Angelina). The soundtrack however is outstanding.
""It's a stupid movie because they sing."" ---- IT'S A MUSICAL.
""It's a stupid movie because the acting/singing is not A-list"" ---- IT'S A B-MOVIE.
If you like thought provoking alternative / rock / new age folk crossed tunes, you'll love this. If you you'd rather your music be nose-bleeding non-thoughtful noise or cry in the beer type, you'll probably hate it.
Bottom line is ---- IT IS A B-MOVIE. If you don't like them, don't watch them. If you like them, watch this one. At the very least you'll appreciate the new approach.",1373673600,2,877,4.556962025316456
5047166,1,B0071BY2EG,"im sick of seeing titles stolen from horror classics just to benefit from the name. total crap. by the way, one of the many things that made the original ""Dont Go in the Woods"" so funny and amusing is that it should be titled ""Don't Go INTO The Woods""...so this is pretty much proof they ripped off the title on purpose. i took everyone's advice and didn't rent, buy or watch this movie...but the one star is for the title ripoff and the inclusion of emo bands and music. ugh. no friggin' thank you.",1372032000,,499,4.319148936170213
5047167,4,B0071BY2EG,"Granted, it's a B horror movie, but knowing that going in, you don't expect this amazing plot. I was blown away by the music, to be honest. Months later, me and my group of friends that rented this together, still sing one of the songs often; my friend with his guitar. ""I'm a man on the edge of extinction"", the music really sticks with you. Now, not many are a huge fan of the cross genre horror/music, but I'm one of them. I love Repo! The Genetic Opera, Sweeney Todd, and I love this. Is it 5 start worthy like those two imho, no. But four stars for sure, as what it is, a b-rated horror movie with music, not for everyone but definitely for me! I love it and have rewatched it several times now, mostly for the music, lol. Music and murder go together like paint by numbers for me! Not for everyone  but I highly recommend it!",1360195200,2,831,4.19375

5047169,1,B0071BY2EG,"I have watched a lot of bad movies through my years on this earth. In most of them I can find some glimmer of hope, but not here.  I don't mind a movie doing something different or unique, but this ""movie"" is just ridiculous.  It's basically one long music video featuring ""songs"" that basically sound the same.

There are ways to incorporate music into a movie (Repo the Genetic Opera, Sweeney Todd, etc.) but this is terrible.  My only assumption is that the director is related, or was paid by the band in this movie to include as many of their songs in as many ridiculous situations as possible.

I cannot stress how awful this ""film"" truly is, It's not a horror movie, or a musical.  A musical in theory would involve the music in the story, this films has many, many scenes of people just standing around singing and it's just a waste of time.  If I wanted to listen to music, I'd put on a cd or mp3 of a band I'd actually like listening to.

Do yourself a tremendous favor and stay away from this ""film""",1348704000,3,1010,4.306878306878307
5047170,1,B0071BY2EG,"<strong>Don't Go in the Woods</strong> (Vincent D'Onofrio, 2010)

If I started this review with a pithy comment about exactly where Vincent D'Onofrio went wrong with <em>Don't Go in the Woods</em>, his first (and, if there is any justice in the world, his last) feature-length directorial effort, we'd end up being here all day, because there are very few things about this movie that are not wrong. But there's one place that does stick out in my mind where it went very wrong indeed--that moment where D'Onofrio decided to take this rather boring slasher film (whether it is a remake, reboot, reimagining, whatever of the 1981 film of the same name I could not tell) and make it a musical. Yes, a musical. Up to a certain point, it could have easily been a bad horror movie about a rock band who go off into the woods in order to get their heads clear and write some new material. There's music involved, of course there is, but it's not a ""musical"" in the sense that the music is integrated into parts of the script where it would not normally be. Band members playing songs and singing, huzzah, and a bunch of groupies and girlfriends and the like have followed them up from New York and gate-crashed the party, which makes lead singer Nick (Matt Sbeglia) angry, for what should be obvious reasons. He blows up and one of the girls stalks off...and starts singing a riff on one of the songs that was just played while walking through the woods. Oh, god, movie, you did just hit a new low indeed. That would be enough to give it a low rating (it is saved from the lowest because a few of the singers are actually quite good; unfortunately, the guy who plays Nick is not one of them) by itself, but then comes the climax, in which Our Director attempts to come up with some ambiguity, but does so in such an inept, ham-fisted way that the viewer is likely to end up scratching his head wondering what on earth Mr. D'Onofrio thought he was doing. Which is a valid approach to the entire film, actually. *",1347235200,,2005,4.478142076502732
5047171,4,B0071BY2EG,"'Don't Go Into The Woods' is misunderstood in that it's humor is misunderstood as much as 'From Dusk To Dawn'. Critics response to the latter film was nearly the same in that no one got the joke regarding the mix of both crime/chase film & horror film. Consequently, the critics didn't get From Dusk To Dawn's mixture of elements, just as the same individuals didn't understand 'Don't Go Into The Woods'.
 The music in 'Don't Go Into The Woods' in eclectic and may not be to everyone's liking as much as the quirky humor; at least it's not the usual over saturation of boobs, butts, along with farting and puking jokes. The young musicians are not professional actors and there have been plenty of films that used ordinary people to portray, surprise, surprise, ordinary people.
 Besides all of the above this is Mr. D'Onofrio's first feature length film, not everyone has runaway hit with their first film, he's been working for a year now, on a script that sounds much more promising to those who hated 'Don't Go Into The Woods'. It's called 'Johnny and Me', the story is about a man with Asperger's syndrome who is a devotee of Johnny Cash's music.

If this sounds interesting, go to You Tube and type in: Vincent D'Onofrio on Johnny and Me & Autism-September 25, 2011",1346457600,4,1271,4.665178571428571

5047174,1,B0071BY2EG,"Highly disappointed with this film.  My interest grew weaker from the actors singing.  ""Little Shop of Horrors"", was a much better horror musical.

It could have been tweaked into a masterpiece actually, but it didn't hold it's own.  And the end....WTH, like they ran out of budget for catered food and just slammed it together for a 5 second finale.
I can say the music was pretty good...done by the actors themselves.
The leader of the music group was a real douche bag and got on my nerves from the beginning. Some of the other characters as well, but then again I'm a little bit psycho myself, sooo....
