8365190,4,B002DGZ72A,It's amazing for a low budget film.  Spencer Gibb (Bee Gee's Robin Gibb's son) was so funny and sexy over exaggerating his British accent!,1387670400,,138,4.75
8365191,4,B002DGZ72A,"This is a small movie, still very unknown but, in my opinion, definitely worth your time. It's quite a good effort and should be seen more widely. I happened to get to to see it awhile ago, really enjoyed it. Now that it's released on DVD, hope it won't stay obscure for long.

If you like discovering little treasures that nobody else knows about, here you go!",1249430400,3,361,4.388059701492537
