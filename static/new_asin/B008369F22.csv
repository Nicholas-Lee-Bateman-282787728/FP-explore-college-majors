8524326,1,B008369F22,"If you have series six then do not buy this one - the two are exactly the same. I am so disappointed that this is the case as I too have lost postage and packaging - not to say too much to those who have not seen series 6 but I wanted to know if they were both working together still!
Also I cannot give a true rating to a duplicate. I do not hate the subject matter nor the story lines but I do hate that they are passing this off as another series!",1385942400,,450,3.7473684210526317

Also this is a region 2 DVD so if you want to get your hands on it early before the North American release, you will need a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player.

Lewis is one of the few `must see' offerings on TV these days so it is so sad that it appears that the seventh series will also be the last. When this series was announced, Laurence Fox (Hathaway) said that there would be no more and stated that both he and Kevin Whately (Lewis) now wanted to pursue other interests. There are just three stories in this series whereas there have normally been four. However, in a break with the previous custom, each is split into two parts.

It is hard to believe that the character of Lewis was introduced in the long running Morse series as long ago as 1986! The chemistry between Morse and Lewis was an obviously significant factor in the success of that series, just as Lewis and Hathaway complement each other in Lewis and the relationship has grown as time has gone on. It is hard to imagine Lewis without Hathaway in the same way that it was hard to imagine Morse without Lewis.

The stories in this series are interesting and well thought out and the plots are quite varied. Down Among the Fearful involves a psychic who has been murdered, in Ramblin' Boy a corpse is discovered which has an interesting background (the corpse not the person) and finally in Intelligent Design, a man is released from prison after serving time for causing death by dangerous driving but it appears that not everyone has forgiven or forgotten his crime. Interesting developments in Lewis' personal life too!

We are up to 27 episodes of Lewis (not quite as many as the 33 Morse managed), and we often watch the earlier ones as they are a joy to revisit. It does rather look as though that is going to be it, and the end of the last episode did have a certain finality about it. However, we can only hope that those involved do have a change of heart.",1365897600,5,2111,4.4
