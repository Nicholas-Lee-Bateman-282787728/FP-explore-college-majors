6084064,5,B00GLPYVT4,"I know that most people think this show jumped the shark when they moved to California, but there are still some good episodes within these last seasons. I did notice a couple of these episodes were the syndicated ones and not the full episodes that were originally aired, but still a great show to go down memory lane with that you watched growing up. This is the one show that I remember my dad laughing out loud especially when it came to Lenny and Squiggy! A true classic!",1393632000,2,476,4.420454545454546
6084065,4,B00GLPYVT4,"Season 7 is the girls' second year in California, making them a bit more established in their new lives working for Bardwell's Department Store, while Laverne's father and stepmother run a restaurant called Cowboy Bill's.

As usual, Laverne and Shirley are on the lookout for men - which generally doesn't turn out well - as well as ways to get rich and overall improve the quality of their lives. The typical wacky hijinks then ensue. But somehow, by this point, it often feels as though we've seen the two going through all the gags and situations, sometimes even more than once.

Season 7 was the last for Cindy Williams, so in essence, although Penny Marshall tried to hold things together on her own in Season 8, this season is basically the last of the ""real"" show.",1393372800,3,771,4.661764705882353
6084066,4,B00GLPYVT4,"All L&S fans know the CA episodes are the most controversial of all 8 seasons. People either like them or hate them. By far season 8 is clearly the worst of all seasons. It's obvious Laverne could not carry the show on her own. By that time, half of the cast had moved on, and the writing was no where as comical as it was in the previous seasons. As far as season 7 is concerned, there were some favorites for me, such as 'It Only Hurts When I Breathe', 'An Affair to Forget', 'Teenage Lust', 'Moving In', 'What Ever Happened to the Class of '56', & 'The Defiant One'. A lot of people believe the move from Milwaukee to Burbank killed the show. Some have even said it took away the 'working class' out of the girls that made Laverne and Shirley so great. Yes they worked in a brewery in Milwaukee, but the girls did not go from rags to riches once they moved to CA. They were still blue-collar,working class women working as gift wrappers at a dept. store & sometimes helping out at Cowboy Bills, so i really don't see what Milwaukee had that California didn't have other than the writing was beginning to get stale by this point. However, i do give season 7 four stars because there were still several great episodes in my opinion that still make me laugh as much as the original episodes did, but it's clearly obvious there weren't as many funny episodes as there were when they were in the Milwaukee.",1392163200,10,1404,4.362595419847328
6084067,2,B00GLPYVT4,"Did anyone notice that the SKI SHOW episode is sloppily edited! When the girls get stuck on the ski lift, they're supposed to get bored and sing, ""Let it Snow,"" and then it begins to snow on them to which they suddenly sing, ""You are my Sunshine."" Too bad. I wonder what happened? That's is one of my favorite episodes from this season. That's is why I give it 2 stars, for not coming through! I wonder how many other episodes have been edited?",1391817600,9,444,4.2976190476190474
6084068,3,B00GLPYVT4,"L & S was one of my favorite line ups back in the mid 70's along with Happy Days and Three's Company on Tuesday nights. The seventh season which was practically the last time we see the girls together was a departure from what use to be. Ever since they left Milwaukee, the show for me (well for everyone else as well) went down hill. But with all that L & S will always be one of my favorite sitcoms of all time. Good or bad, the rest of the seasons is a must have. Hopefully we will be able to see these shows in Blu-ray someday with all the bits and pieces intact. Maybe! I will be getting these soon.",1391817600,2,604,4.0
6084069,3,B00GLPYVT4,"Laverne & Shirley was one of the most popular sitcoms of the late 1970s/early 1980s. Created by Hollywood icon Garry Marshall (who had his hand in a dozen other popular primetime shows), the show featured two single gals (future A League of Their Own director Penny Marshall, and American Graffiti's Cindy Williams) working at a Milwaukee brewery capping bottles while struggling with being roommates, their love lives, and any other shenanigans the writers could throw their way. The show was a spin-off of Marshall's uber-successful Happy Days; Laverne and Shirley came from the same fictional background as Henry Winkler's The Fonz, and with that a television classic was born.

The seventh season of Laverne & Shirley may be seen as the season where the series finally 'jumped the shark' (a term ironically taken from a scene in Happy Days where the Fonz went waterskiing over some great white sharks); needing a fresh setting, the show uprooted the girls, as well as their friends and family, and plopped them down in the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. In my humble opinion, this proved to be a creative mistake. Clearly, I wasn't a huge fan of Season Seven. Although the actors do an admirable job of tackling the roles they'd perfected over six years, the writing never feels as fluid or finely tuned as it did during the show's initial seasons. It could be that because the Milwaukee location was such an integral part of the show, taking it to California feels like the writers were fitting a square peg into a round hole. It's also asking a lot of the audience to buy so many other characters would uproot their lives to follow Laverne and Shirley to Tinsel Town.

If nothing else, this set is worth a look for the performances, which are the one thing that make it worth recommending. Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams are at their looniest playing off each other, skilled comediennes who are able to wring laughs out of just one withering look. Penny Marshall (the sister of creator Garry Marshall) has pitch perfect delivery, often getting a lot of mileage from her sad sack/hound dog expressions. Following them to California are Lenny and Squiggy, played perfectly by Best in Show's Michael McKean and Used Cars' David Lander. Both actors are a treat as two lovable, marble-mouthed grease balls always making life a bit too difficult for Laverne and Shirley.

The episodes here range from decent to middling; often it feels like the writers are stretching to make the new setting really work for the characters. Many episodes feature typical sitcom sillinessin one episode (""Ski Show"") Laverne and Shirley take to the ski slopes in the hopes that they'll meet some eligible bachelors (wackiness ensues). Another episode features the girls getting into a squabble over breakfast cereal that ends with one of them getting a broken jaw (""It Only Hurts When I Breathe""). The one episode that did make me laugh more than usual featured Laverne being wooed by a suave married man who is forced to try and hide the fact that he has a wife by putting her inside of a fish tank (Laverne's reaction is priceless).

Fans of the series will be happy that Paramount has finally issued the second-to-last season on DVD. They should cherish this DVD set because it would be the last time the two ladies would be featured together for a full season. By the third episode of the eighth season, co-star Cindy Williams became pregnant and unceremoniously left the show (igniting a legal battle with the studio), leaving Penny Marshall to carry the rest of the series herself. While the ratings were stronger than expected, Laverne & Shirley ended its network run in May of 1983. Considering the quality of this seventh season, it was probably a long overdue decision by Paramount.

Laverne & Shirley: The Seventh Season is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 full frame in standard definition. The image quality for each of these 22 episodes is good considering this season is now well over thirty years old. Colors are evenly saturated and black levels sufficiently dark. While the image quality may not be revelatory, overall the series looks better than fans may have been expecting. The soundtrack is presented in Dolby 1.0 Mono in English. This is a very front heavy audio mix that doesn't feature much in the way of dynamic range or fidelity. Dialogue, music, and effects are all clearly recorded. Also included on this 3-disc set are English subtitles. There are no bonus features.

6084070,3,B00GLPYVT4,"As another reviewer previously mentioned, it looks like they are going ahead and releasing the remainder of the series after all.  Once this season is released, that leaves only Season 8 to complete the set.  With that said, it took nearly 10 years for us to get the entire collection on DVD, likely held up by legal issues and licensing/royalty fees for all the guest performers that starred over the years.  In any case, it'll be nice to have the complete collection once and for all, and we've certainly waited long enough to get to this point.

Season 7 is the last official season with Shirley.  Cindy Williams, pregnant with her first child and also in a contractual dispute with Paramount at the time, opted to leave the series early in the eighth season, her character being written off after she ""moved"" overseas to be with her army-doctor-husband, Walter Meeney.  Betty Garrett and Ed Marinaro have already jumped ship here and their characters are absent for the remainder of the series. (Marinaro went on to star in ""Hill Street Blues"" while Garrett had previously committed to another project).  Rhonda-Lee (Leslie Easterbrook) is given about the same amount of screen time, and Lenny and Squiggy, along with Frank and Carmine, are also still present.  This is the season that officially ""ended"" the series, IMO.  Season 8 without Shirley was a disaster, and though Penny Marshall tried hard to hold the show on her own, the nail was already in the coffin.  Michael McKean all but vanished from the final episodes without explanation and Eddie Mekka's character moves away to the Big Apple to audition for a part in the Broadway production of ""Hair.""

All in all, Season 7 exemplifies just how much the show had departed from the format of the ""Milwaukee Years"", with major changes in both the casting and writing of the scripts, which only served to bring on the beginning of the end.  It is what it is.  There were few stand-out episodes in this season, although the one starring Richard Moll as a bankrobber with Shirley getting framed for robbery in the process, was pretty good.  There was also an episode where Laverne somehow ended up in a lobster tank that was also pretty comical from what I remember.  But that's about it, folks.  This is the season when the writing started to suffer, and the plots often became nonsensical.  Evidently, it was obvious the writers/producers were desperately trying to keep the show afloat, but it just wasn't working anymore.  The episodes were getting more ridiculous and the writers were simply running out of ideas.  With two characters already gone and another major cast member soon making an exit, that left Penny Marshall with no real ""sidekick"".  The writing was on the wall, the show was on borrowed time.  The end was nigh.

I'm also curious to see whether or not some of the music has been changed again, as we saw happen in Season 6.  There was also a big chunk from the ""Malibu Mansion"" episode that was inexplicably missing, breaking the continuity of the program and leaving many viewers scratching their heads in confusion.  That particular episode was just plain bizarre without the missing footage.  In any case, we'll have to wait and see what kind of surprises Paramount/CBS has in store for us in this round.  Get this collection only if you're a true die-hard L&S fan, otherwise this season is overall forgettable.

Enjoy nonetheless...",1388275200,31,3415,4.833046471600689

6084108,5,B00GLPYVT4,"The 6th and 8th seasons were slow,but this one kept me laughing almost all the way through. I especially liked the the tap scene in the episode That's Entertainment because I knew it was live. Laverne (Penny Marshall and Eddie Mekka were both proffessional tap dancers.)I didn't think the doctor scene showed Shirley at anywhere near her best,but that's got more to do with it being spur of the moment slapstick that was good for Groucho Marx. I'd say Shirley's acting,looks, along with her naive and unusual personality made her own style.",1420848000,,540,4.880434782608695

6084144,4,B00GLPYVT4,"The next to the last season finds the girls up to more antics now that they've settled in California. These episodes have been very nicely digitally remastered and look great. It appears to me at least that one or two of the episodes have been edited down most likely for music rights problems. Frank's wife Edna does not appear in any of the season seven episodes although she is mentioned once or twice. It was nice to see ""Big Rosey Greenbaum"" make an appearance in the high school reunion episode. While many of the episodes feature the girls in their familiar antics several episodes seem to feature the supporting cast members with the girls only making brief cameo appearances. All in all I really enjoyed watching season seven and of course will have to complete my collection of the series when season eight is released in May.
