We now use the Ballet and Stretch and Tap and Acrobatics DVDs on a regular basis. While I love that the ballet and Stretch DVD gives me a great workout, and makes my daughter feel like a princess ballerina, I love the energy that the Tap and Acrobatics gets out of her. And the coordination that it's building is incredible. The fact that she's not just jumping around aimlessly, but actually learning real dance technique, and having fun with me is amazing. We love this DVD and will continue to use use it as a workout, playtime, and, intro to dance. =)",1298592000,3,698,4.376923076923077
