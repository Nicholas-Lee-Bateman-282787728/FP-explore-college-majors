5996369,5,B00FKTB1H2,"The whole myth... story has been told repeatedly over the decades and always with the same - same - same - same- get the point? ""You know what's coming next story line!""  and all myth... characters are played true to form  (HEADS UP SPOILER ALERT) Hercules- Tall-Thin-Muscular-Brave-oh yeah and Blond now that is typical portrayal, but tune into this and WELL let's just say you'll receive a belly full of joy and surprises!  :))  and then there is the (as Jason calls him) the triangle guy (OMG  that was funny) our family calls him Pi we keep getting tongue tied on his name LOL..

5996370,5,B00FKTB1H2,I just watched all three episodes and I thought it was very good. Has a good plot and if given the chance could last at least 2 seasons if given the chance. I do enjoy the storylines in the three episodes. I would recommend to friends.,1386892800,,235,4.130434782608695
5996371,3,B00FKTB1H2,"A young man arrives in a legendary city ruled over by a tyrannical monarch, where a mysterious prophet waits in an underground cavern, telling him of his great destiny as a future hero. Throw in a bromance, a rebellious princess, a few CGI beasties, and a new spin on familiar legends, and I've just described ""Atlantis"".

I've also just described&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>. This not a coincidence, as both shows share the same producers, writers, directors, and occasionally the same actors. Even some of the sets and sound-effects are the same (fans of the earlier show will instantly recognise that the screams of the Furies are just like the Dorocha). It's pretty clear that this is an attempt to recapture the success of ""Merlin"", which for the record - isn't a bad thing. Heck, it's good business. The problem lies with the fact that the brains behind ""Atlantis"" seem to be almost comically misinformed about what made ""Merlin"" such a success. If anything, all they've done is recycle the *worst* components of its predecessor.

Jason (Jack Donnelly) is a young man searching for his missing father, who takes a submarine down into the depths of the ocean, only to wake up some time later on the shores of a strange beach. He explores further and finds himself in Atlantis, ruled over by King Minos and Queen Pasiphae, and the beautiful Princess Ariadne. Soon enough he makes friends with Hercules and Pythagoras (Mark Addy and Robert Emms) and is told by the Oracle living in the Temple of Poseidon that he's been brought there for a reason - though she will not say what.

Yet having established that Jason has apparently travelled back in time, this is never again brought up. If you were to start watching from the second episode (or even halfway through the first) you'd have no idea whatsoever that Jason was from the contemporary world. Did he just forget about it, along with the search for his father? We learn absolutely nothing about his life before coming to Atlantis: his mother, his friends, his job prospects, his hobbies - nothing. He's just a blank slate. Furthermore, he seems to have no problems whatsoever to acclimatizing to living in an ancient civilization. Does he miss hot running water? Electricity and medicine? Television and the internet? Apparently not, though as any fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepy-Hollow/dp/B00F91FQZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepy Hollow</a>&nbsp;can tell you, there is a lot of fun to be found in fish out of water scenarios.

Only occasionally does Jason demonstrate knowledge of the Greek myths that make up this world, though that only leads to another problem. See, the underlying premise of ""Merlin"" was that it was a prequel to Arthurian legends. This provided the writers for opportunities to explore elements of the familiar story in what could be quite clever ways (the creation of Excalibur, the origins of the Lady of the Lake, the forming of the Knights of the Round Table). You can tell that ""Atlantis"" is trying to do the same thing here by including such characters as Medusa and Odeipus, figures whose fates are already known to the audiences (and Jason).

Yet the problem with this that unlike the Arthurian legends, which have a distinct beginning, middle and end, the diaspora of Greek myths are varied and largely unconnected to each other. The show comes across as somewhat random as a result, not helped by the fact that real historical figures such as Pythagoras exist alongside the mythological ones. So is Jason in the distant past? Or another dimension? Is this meant to be the ""true story"" behind the Greek myths that were distorted over time, or is it a completely different world where all bets are off? The show gives us no clue at all, and plays so fast and loose with the content of the Greek myths that it's impossible to figure it out.

The characters are likeable enough, but not hugely interesting. You could probably remove Pythagoras from the show entirely without it having much effect on the overarching storylines, and though the presence of the famous mathematician and philosopher should lead to scenes of lateral problem-solving or thinking outside the box, he's really just there to be the mildly geeky sidekick. You could count the number of times he mentions triangles on one hand, and his interest in them is just used for a running gag anyway. Meanwhile Mark Addy plays his usual role as the loud, boisterous, drunken womanizer. Here Hercules is characterized as a man whose reputation is wildly exaggerated in order to cover for his gambling, drinking and womanizing ways - you'll either find this amusing or tedious, but given that Addy is given first-billing, he ends up dominating the show, even to the detriment of Jason.

Then there's the female characters. These show-runners were notoriously bad at doing right by the women in ""Merlin"", whose female characters came in three flavours: evil witches, distressed damsels, and dead plot-devices. In five years I think there was only one exception to this rule, and the trend continues well into ""Atlantis"". Evil Queen? Check. Evil Witch? Check. Evil Cult of Evil Priestesses? Check. Of our two main female characters Princess Ariadne is given virtually nothing to do expect stare at Jason and exchange snarky comments with her stepmother, and though Medusa is afforded a little agency at first, she's soon relegated to hostage, victim, and love interest to a man who used an enchantment to brainwash her into loving him. She'll no doubt go the way of Morgana: sweet and kind at first, only to become evil off-screen without any warning. Oh, and take a shot every time a woman gets drugged or enchanted against her will. These writers *love* that one.

Edit: in a late episode, they do finally manage to introduce a female character who breaks the mould: one who is capable, benevolent and survives the episode. I was genuinely astonished.

In the interests of fairness, the production values of the show are very high, with above-average sets, costumes, and CGI. Much of the show was filmed on-location in Morocco, and the actors are likeable enough. Sarah Parish in particular plays the role of evil queen with panache, and many of the guest stars are familiar British thespians who've turned up for a bit of fun.

But if you think I'm being unfair by comparing it to ""Merlin"", that's simply because it tries to replicate so many of its predecessors' components that it's almost impossible to judge it on its own merits. Perhaps if I hadn't been aware of the production team behind it - but I was, and thus the similarities are obvious. There's lots of shirtlessness, a slew of fat jokes, a lack of continuity, and plenty of plot holes (how exactly did Jason become a master swordsman overnight?) Also, is Atlantis even an island? The characters cross deserts and visit other large cities, giving no indication whatsoever that the city of Atlantis, famed for sinking below the waves, is in any way surrounded by the ocean.

Basically, it's a diverting enough show for youngsters (though your daughters deserve much better representation than this) and popular enough to be renewed for at least one more series. As light fluff it's enjoyable enough, so you may well enjoy it for its entertainment value without the need for any particular depth.",1386288000,6,7474,5.058441558441558

5996373,3,B00FKTB1H2,"It's only been two episodes. I don't think it will hold on to long. The lead character is from 2013, but he doesn't make any references to the time, or talk about his previous life at all. That's unrealistic. You can't move from one culture to another and not want to talk about your life in the previous one. He's on a research ship, piloting a million dollar submarine by himself, but there is no mention how or why. Is he a botanist? An ocean researcher? Treasure explorer? What is he an expert in? If so, why doesn't he use any of his knowledge or talk about it? In the first episode, he's very clumsy with a sword, in the second he's an expert? Really? The writers need to start filing in the holes, or the series won't last. With that said, it is interesting to watch, and I'll watch more to see what happens. But it needs some fleshing out.",1386201600,16,847,4.267080745341615
5996374,2,B00FKTB1H2,"If you like ""cheezy"" TV, then this show is for you. It brims with all the inconsistencies and hokie jokes of all the old school 70's fantasy shows.

Three Stars because it is mildly entertaining and may grow into a Xena-type show worthy of our time as the characters develop and the writers become more comfortable.",1386115200,3,315,4.625
5996375,4,B00FKTB1H2,"This show succeds as a mythological fantasy in the vein of 'Hurclease' and 'Xena'.

First of all, the production values of this first episode are excellent-the production staff did a perfect job of creating a real word all the way from cgi, locations, and costumeing.  The writeing is good, and the charicters are well realized, with plenty of room for growth.

I give it four stars because it seems to be aimed at more of a young demographic--time will tell if this show will grow to include an adult audience.

P.S. The take on Hurclease is a hoot! (I'm not fat, just big boned.!)",1385510400,4,582,4.5673076923076925

I watched the entire series, but my husband watched only 1 episode and said it was too cheesy for him.  He prefers movies, etc that have a more realistic/serious subject matter. (His rating was a 2.)  If you are of the same mindset, you probably would want to pass on this series.  But, I think it is an entertaining diversion and would buy it again.

If there is a ""downside"" to this program it will lay in the hearts of purists. I confess to falling into this trap with the first few episodes, my thinking being that if you're going to have the nerve to exploit classical mythology you'll do some honor to the source. There is nothing here of the original myths other than names and monsters. There are no life lessons or moral objects, just silly little stories with some decent actors.
It is well filmed and decently acting. The dialogue is nothing original and intentionally neutral. There is nothing here that will challenge anyone of any age.

I only gave it three stars because the series hasn't addressed certain missing details of Atlantis such as the lack of concentric canals, that this Atlantis doesn't appear to be an island but a desert, and the occupants don't seem to be technologically superior to other civilisations of the time. The writers haven't tried to sell any of those points that we heard about Atlantis. Consequently, it is very easy to forget that they are in Atlantis until the characters refers to it by name.

5996589,2,B00FKTB1H2,"I wanted to like this show. I tried to like this show. The lead is personable. The premise has potential.

Searching for his father, Jason stumbles into Atlantis, which turns out to be a parallel earth. Why they bother with this plot element, I have no clue. After episode one it seems to lose any significance. The writers might as well have started us in the mythical Atlantis and give the character a decent back story.

Atlantis is depressing. You'd expect some kind of civilization, maybe some steampunk neatness, or an inexplicable pseudo-science. Instead you get a bastardized ancient Greece, in which everyone speaks English until it's time to pray or cast a spell--then everyone speaks Greek.

Jason's bumbling friends, Pythagoras, who has no personality or character and, Hercules, who has been comically reduced to a cowardly slob, are irritating at the best of times. Most of the other recurring characters are bland and generic. Jason has somehow ended up living with Pythagoras and Hercules (why do they live together?), and at no point seeks to move on in search of his father, destiny or decent lodging. While somehow not knowing anything of the customs of Atlantis, he manages to kowtow to its rules regarding Ariadne alone, Rather than seeking after the obvious love interest, he drags his friends into one seeming catastrophe after the next due to his lack of knowledge regarding how life works in Atlantis. You'd think after the first or second time his friends would sit down and lay out the rules for him...

The absolute most annoying feature of the series is its obsession with bad chase scenes through dirty Aladdin-esque streets. Every episode so far has featured a chase scene in which the characters masterfully outwit the guards by hiding behind obvious objects as they run by or by climbing up onto the roof of a building.

This show is a disappointment and fails to achieve the campy goodness of Xena, Hercules and Merlin. I'm fairly certain that Atlantis has only run as long as it has because of the protagonist's frequent displays of partial nudity. He spends almost as much time with his shirt off as he does running through the beggar-ridden streets of Atlantis",1409443200,4,2197,4.895161290322581

It can be good for taking your mind off work, and with minimal gore or explicit content, it's probably suitable for teens and pre-teens, not just adults. But it's clearly an adventure series without much to interest the more thoughtful viewer. Viewers interested in heavier, more emotionally involved series or shows that use their time to tackle tough social issues (think: Battlestar Galactica, Fringe, Outcasts, Game of Thrones, Continuum, or even Avatar the Last Airbender), will probably get bored with Atlantis' superficial themes of heroism, power struggle, and mythology come alive in an ancient Greek society, and its comparatively transparent plot arcs.

It is not one of the best-written, nor one of the best-acted dramas, but it is smut-free, morally strong, and the values of friendship always triumph in the end of every episode.

The writers have played fast and loose with Greek mythology, but we're not really watching for education.  Perhaps watching would lead one to check out the stories and names on Wikipedia (which we've often done). For example, the character of Hercules is a fat slob with a Yorkshire accent, rather than the world's strongest man, and I've yet to figure out if the main character of Jason is THE Jason from Jason and the Argonauts who will quest for the Golden Fleece (We are only on episode 10).

No matter.  I'm just glad I can watch a show with my kids without wincing at vulgar language or rude scenes of skin-to-skin contact which is the usual fodder of network television.  Just an occasional shirtless shot of Jason preparing for combat. Some of the supernatural beasties might be a little scary for the very young, but not as scary as Harry Potter movies.

Generating comparisons based on a commercial or even the first episode is dangerous because you run the risk of missing out on something far more rewarding than you imagined. Feeling my own preconception get bested by a new TV show is a fun bit of chagrin for me, showing it is not always a bad thing to be proven wrong.
The BBC series Atlantis brings a new twist to the legendary lost city.

In this version, Atlantis is home to not only its own legends, but also a flurry of Greek mythological heroes and monsters. The story surrounds Jason, who falls through a wormhole in time back to the ancient city and quickly befriends the famous duo of Hercules and Pythagoras (who never actually meet in the original tales). Jason is at the center of a dark and troubling prophecy, but he doesnt understand his part and must decide how hard to fight to get away from it, while not risking the lives of the friends he meets along the way.

After watching the first episode, I thought I had this show pegged. Its the BBC version of Xena: Warrior Princess. There are jokes, some slapstick humor and fantastical action, which always seems to include lots of acrobatic flipping by the hero. I didn't expect much more as it went along, but I found myself drawn in by the most simple of premises. Jason, played charmingly by Jack Donnelly, is the prototypical fish out of water, but his naivet comes across as very genuine. A poignant and poetic side of the character evolves from his foreknowledge of events since some of the people he meets are part of the stories he was told as a kid in the future. When he is introduced a lovely lady by the name of Medusa, he sadly realizes her fate is already sealed, no matter how much he would want to change it. Watching him navigate those waters and balance his morality with so-called destiny is much better than your ordinary scifi/fantasy fare.

The revisionist stories are also fun for those people who know the original stories; the show is full of mythological easter eggs just for you. The writers find more and more creative ways to drop in folks like King Midas, the Minotour, Pandoras Box, and of course the historical significance of Hercules and Pythagoras. Jasons two lovable sidekicks, the ancient version of Laurel and Hardy, provide much of the heart for the show. This version of Hercules shows a man past his prime and living off the legends of his past heroics, which more and more seem like fairy tales in themselves. He drinks too much, gambles too much, and takes too much advantage of those who care about him, but he is loyal to the end and proves to be there when hes really needed. While Pythagoras is braver and more courageous than his thin frame belies, he uses his brain (and his love of science and triangles) to help his friends cheat death time and time again.

The villains are numerous and they provide an endless series of hoops for Jason and his friends to jump through in order to stay alive and chase their dreams, which for Jason is the love of Atlantis Princess Ariadne. Her place in the royal family and Jasons place, or lack thereof, trots out the tried and true long lost lovers storyline. Yet the stories that surround our hero, including some which I won't give away, keep the show multi-layered and full of possibilities.

Atlantis is a fun show that is easy to pass off, but don't make that mistake. It will get under your skin and soon enough youll find yourself cheering out loud for the talented trio of heroes.",1399334400,,3777,4.532258064516129

Throw in a bromance, a rebellious princess, a few CGI beasties, and a new spin on familiar legends, and I've just described ""Atlantis"".

I've also just described&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>. This not a coincidence, as both shows share the same producers, writers, directors, and occasionally the same actors. Even some of the sets and sound-effects are the same (fans of the earlier show will instantly recognise that the screams of the Furies are just like the Dorocha). It's pretty clear that this is an attempt to recapture the success of ""Merlin"", which for the record - isn't a bad thing. Heck, it's good business. The problem lies with the fact that the brains behind ""Atlantis"" seem to be almost comically misinformed about what made ""Merlin"" such a success. If anything, all they've done is recycle the *worst* components of its predecessor.

Jason (Jack Donnelly) is a young man searching for his missing father, who takes a submarine down into the depths of the ocean, only to wake up some time later on the shores of a strange beach. He explores further and finds himself in Atlantis, ruled over by King Minos and Queen Pasiphae, and the beautiful Princess Ariadne. Soon enough he makes friends with Hercules and Pythagoras (Mark Addy and Robert Emms) and is told by the Oracle living in the Temple of Poseidon that he's been brought there for a reason - though she will not say what.

Yet having established that Jason has apparently travelled back in time, this is never again brought up. If you were to start watching from the second episode (or even halfway through the first) you'd have no idea whatsoever that Jason was from the contemporary world. Did he just forget about it, along with the search for his father? We learn absolutely nothing about his life before coming to Atlantis: his mother, his friends, his job prospects, his hobbies - nothing. He's just a blank slate. Furthermore, he seems to have no problems whatsoever to acclimatizing to living in an ancient civilization. Does he miss hot running water? Electricity and medicine? Television and the internet? Apparently not, though as any fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepy-Hollow/dp/B00F91FQZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepy Hollow</a>&nbsp;can tell you, there is a lot of fun to be found in fish out of water scenarios.

Only occasionally does Jason demonstrate knowledge of the Greek myths that make up this world, though that only leads to another problem. See, the underlying premise of ""Merlin"" was that it was a prequel to Arthurian legends. This provided the writers for opportunities to explore elements of the familiar story in what could be quite clever ways (the creation of Excalibur, the origins of the Lady of the Lake, the forming of the Knights of the Round Table). You can tell that ""Atlantis"" is trying to do the same thing here by including such characters as Medusa and Odeipus, figures whose fates are already known to the audiences (and Jason).

Yet the problem with this that unlike the Arthurian legends, which have a distinct beginning, middle and end, the diaspora of Greek myths are varied and largely unconnected to each other. The show comes across as somewhat random as a result, not helped by the fact that real historical figures such as Pythagoras exist alongside the mythological ones. So is Jason in the distant past? Or another dimension? Is this meant to be the ""true story"" behind the Greek myths that were distorted over time, or is it a completely different world where all bets are off? The show gives us no clue at all, and plays so fast and loose with the content of the Greek myths that it's impossible to figure it out.

The characters are likeable enough, but not hugely interesting. You could probably remove Pythagoras from the show entirely without it having much effect on the overarching storylines, and though the presence of the famous mathematician and philosopher should lead to scenes of lateral problem-solving or thinking outside the box, he's really just there to be the mildly geeky sidekick. You could count the number of times he mentions triangles on one hand, and his interest in them is just used for a running gag anyway. Meanwhile Mark Addy plays his usual role as the loud, boisterous, drunken womanizer. Here Hercules is characterized as a man whose reputation is wildly exaggerated in order to cover for his gambling, drinking and womanizing ways - you'll either find this amusing or tedious, but given that Addy is given first-billing, he ends up dominating the show, even to the detriment of Jason.

Then there's the female characters. These show-runners were notoriously bad at doing right by the women in ""Merlin"", whose female characters came in three flavours: evil witches, distressed damsels, and dead plot-devices. In five years I think there was only one exception to this rule, and the trend continues well into ""Atlantis"". Evil Queen? Check. Evil Witch? Check. Evil Cult of Evil Priestesses? Check. Of our two main female characters Princess Ariadne is given virtually nothing to do expect stare at Jason and exchange snarky comments with her stepmother, and though Medusa is afforded a little agency at first, she's soon relegated to hostage, victim, and love interest to a man who used an enchantment to brainwash her into loving him. She'll no doubt go the way of Morgana: sweet and kind at first, only to become evil off-screen without any warning. Oh, and take a shot every time a woman gets drugged or enchanted against her will. These writers *love* that one.

Edit: in a late episode, they do finally manage to introduce a female character who breaks the mould: one who is capable, benevolent and survives the episode. I was genuinely astonished.

In the interests of fairness, the production values of the show are very high, with above-average sets, costumes, and CGI. Much of the show was filmed on-location in Morocco, and the actors are likeable enough. Sarah Parish in particular plays the role of evil queen with panache, and many of the guest stars are familiar British thespians who've turned up for a bit of fun.

But if you think I'm being unfair by comparing it to ""Merlin"", that's simply because it tries to replicate so many of its predecessors' components that it's almost impossible to judge it on its own merits. Perhaps if I hadn't been aware of the production team behind it - but I was, and thus the similarities are obvious. There's lots of shirtlessness, a slew of fat jokes, a lack of continuity, and plenty of plot holes (how exactly did Jason become a master swordsman overnight?) Also, is Atlantis even an island? The characters cross deserts and visit other large cities, giving no indication whatsoever that the city of Atlantis, famed for sinking below the waves, is in any way surrounded by the ocean.

Basically, it's a diverting enough show for youngsters (though your daughters deserve much better representation than this) and popular enough to be renewed for at least one more series. As light fluff it's enjoyable enough, but if you want a higher quality BBC period drama/adventure series for the whole family, then definitely check out their latest rendition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Musketeers/dp/B00HSLI3S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Musketeers</a>&nbsp;instead.

The scripts do have forced humor, but it is for a family audience, so that is understandable. That it respects its subject and tries to inform about the ancient world culture is a five star effort that only the 50's Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans, etc. has attempted. Even though the ancients didn't have a sense of the biology, laws of physics, etc. they did have a pool of wisdom which sadly kids today are not getting passed on to them.
