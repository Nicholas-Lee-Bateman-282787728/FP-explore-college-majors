3413986,4,B00189PSVS,"Este tributo al mejor estadio de baseball es un buen video. Todo el contenido tiene un valor histrico muy rico, por tradicin, por la mstica.

Lo que se puede apreciar es que hay parte del contenido de los dilogos del dvd conmemorativo de los 100 aos del equipo pero bueno, para enriquecer las imgenes est bien.

En general, este video no aburre, al contrario, nos ayuda a mantener vivos los recuerdos de esos aos tan gloriosos, de campeonatos, de series mundiales, de juegos perfectos, de jugadas espectaculares, en fin, de tantas cosas hermosas que nos da el Yankee Baseball.

Lo que me decepcion un poco fue el encontar que este dvd no tiene sonido 5.1 ni remasterizacin THX, tal y como lo indica la tabla de caractersticas del producto.

Saludos a la aficin Yankee!! cmprenlo, no se arrepentirn...",1223337600,,800,4.77536231884058
3413987,5,B00189PSVS,"I loved the 1st Disc, plenty of great footage and they have some great rare photos and video footage.  2nd Disc is typical of most 2-DVD set, mostly the unedited highlights.",1221350400,,173,4.580645161290323
3413988,5,B00189PSVS,This is an awesome DVD and a MUST HAVE for all yankee fans out there!,1221091200,3,69,3.6666666666666665

3413990,5,B00189PSVS,I love the yankee stadium that the park are very powerful baseball park which 26 world series champs when the yankees are playing the world series games that I rooted the yankees for 4 years (1996-1998-1999-2000). I like the red sox players went to the Yankees for the contract :-),1215648000,,281,4.64
3413991,4,B00189PSVS,"The first disc is two hours of history about the Stadium, with commentary by everyone from George Bush to Aaron Boone (LOVE Aaron Boone!). Oddly missing from the commentary: George Steinbrenner. It's so well-made, and with the Gladiator-esque music pumping through the background, it makes you appreciate the building and the history and the team even more. I was more disappointed in the second disc, of ""bonus features,"" which had things like Lou Gehrig's speech and Aaron Boone's home run. But they only showed about three lines of the speech - and I know there exists more newsreel footage than that of the ceremony, and they didn't use Michael Kay's commentary on Aaron Boone, and I know they had the rights to use it, because they showed earlier clips on the first disc using it. But apart from those glaring omissions, I loved every minute of the discs.",1215388800,23,860,4.8175675675675675
3413992,5,B00189PSVS,"This is a excellent video about the big old ballpark in the bronx.  It captures all the great moments in the stadium's history and more.  A must have for true Yankee fans.  It goes along perfectly with ""Yankee Stadium The Official Retrospective"" hardcover book.  I highly recommend this 2-disc set.",1215302400,8,298,4.9

3413997,5,B00189PSVS,"It was no mystery Old Yankee stadium was the picture perfect ballpark the greatest sports landmark ever created by man. I have been a die hard Yankee fan all my 21 years of living and i have seen it all here Jeter's 2001 WS gm 4 walk off homer,Aaron Boones 2003 AlCS game 7 walk off homer (prolly my most favorite Yankee stadium moment),Roger Clemens wins his 300th career game against the Cardinals,A-rods 500th career homer etc. I have seen all these great moments and for years i always wanted to go to Yankee stadium and see a game and in 2008 my wish came true. It was a graduation gift from my mother i got to see two games there against the Orioles in the final season of the stadium. When i first walked into the stadium i was left in all amazed i could literally feel the history here i never seen such a beautiful field in my life. We were seated out in the bleacher creature section where i got to mingle with some truly devoted fans like myself and it was awesome i love the roadcalls they do and root very loudly! I got to see one of my pitching heroes Mike Mussina (a.k.a Moose)pitch again before he retired at the end of the season and saw A-rod belt a huge homer and the great Mariano Rivera make a relief appearance (no save situation) it was awesome i did not want to leave at all! i recently bought this dvd and i love it i got to see some great history that was made there before i was born and relive some more recent history. I must have watched this 5 times already but i cannot help but shed a tear when i watch it. I will greatly miss this awesome ballpark i think it is just down right wrong they want to get rid of it but the new stadium is alright not as good as the old one i think but least we won a championship in the new house though! bottom line if you love the Yankees and the stadium as much as i do you will love this dvd and the collectible ticket goes great with it!!!!",1271980800,3,1908,4.0906666666666665
3413998,1,B00189PSVS,MY question is where is the collectable ticket&coin? I would really appreciate a reply as customer service from AMAZON does not know. THANK you. NICK,1260835200,,149,5.0

3414000,5,B00189PSVS,My boyfriend loved this DVD! Very Happy that he can see some of the replays that happened at the stadium.,1232236800,,105,4.3
3414001,4,B00189PSVS,I purchased this product for my 19 year old son who is a huge Yankee fan.  He's watched it several times since receiving it for Christmas and loves it.  This last summer he was able to go to New York City with his dad and see a game in the old stadium before it was closed...lasting memories that are relived when he watches this video.,1231718400,,336,4.153846153846154
3414002,4,B00189PSVS,"The only problem was there wasn't nearly enough time on the disc to really get into all of the little things that this stadium has seen. It was done well and is certainly worth buying, but anyone who's either ever been to the stadium or knows about it's (& Yankee) history will feel kind of slighted. It's kind of like going to your favorite band's concert and only hearing the hits that you've heard 1,000 times before when you wanted to hear the ""deep cuts"".",1223769600,6,460,4.423529411764706
8268959,5,B00189PSVS,"I was in Yankee Stadium in 1950, 1953 and 1958. I wanted a rememberance of it. This fits the bill nicely.",1516838400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8268960,4,B00189PSVS,"This is good, not great, DVD. It is interesting but jumpy in spots. For instance, when showing Larsen's perfect game they show footage and radio call, but then cut to pictures of the empty stadium (while the radio cal in on-going), before going back to the final footage of the scene. This happens with multiple events. Still, I am glad I have the DVD. Yankee Stadium was wonderful to all fans who had a chance to see a game there. The new one is for profit. It was sacrilegious to tear the original stadium down.",1516147200,,513,4.410526315789474

8268965,4,B00189PSVS,"I have not seen this DVD, BUT my nephews who are true Yankee fans 9 &11 and their dad said it was great. The coin and ticket and added bonus.
Anything Yankee is a winner in this family, so they were thrilled. I cannot speak to the content as I did not see this DVD. BUT I was at the Yogi Beara Museum in NJ and this was the same DVD shown there. It was great and extremely informative to a non Yankee fan. The history of the stadium, the tributes, and the Yankee history was interesting. It is a long DVD, but lots of info!

Go Mets!!",1431648000,,534,3.9444444444444446
8268966,4,B00189PSVS,"My son wanted to see The House that Ruth Built on a vacation trip right before the move to the new Yankee home park.  However, his flights got mixed up somehow, and he didn't get that firsthand, personal visit that he'd planned.  I gave him this video set as a next-best idea.  He appreciated the thought and still plans to see some of the old, original ballparks remaining.  He did get to see Wrigley field on that earlier trip and still wants to go to Boston soon.  Seemed like a good purchase as a gift to him.",1430092800,,513,4.247422680412371

8268968,4,B00189PSVS,"This isn't bad. Really, it's not. It's just that......well, how many times can we watch the same plays over and over?

The packaging is kinda nice. The coin is cool. The ticket is a nice item. The DVD.....well, same ol' stuff.

Still, it's about Yankee Stadium. Can't go wrong there. I consider myself fortunate to have been to the original place many times as a kid, the re-worked place after the renovation many times, and a few times to the new joint. So, this disc is a nice reminder of a wonderful place and (perhaps) a wonderful time. It's pretty inexpensive, so go for it.

And put that Boston team out of your mind for a while. We'll all be better off.",1388620800,,660,4.39344262295082
