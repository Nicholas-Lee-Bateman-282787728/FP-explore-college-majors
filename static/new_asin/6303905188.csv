721658,4,6303905188,"Of the three most recent live concert videos Ive seen two and seen the 1989 tour'steel wheels'live at shea stadium with 'the cult of personality' opening up for the stones. Live at the max was good and filmed in London,vodoo loounge in maimi. Never seen bridges to babylon but know it has to be good or great because the rolling stones are still the best in the music industry to this day! I personally edge out vodoo lounge over'live at the max' for three reasons:1]robert cray[2]bo didly[3]and a acoustic set that set it apart from a typical concert. I imagine they did something differant and/or oringinal for the babylon tour wich I missed,even though I lived in a city of bridges[portland O.R.]!.I heard Ron Wood was good in this one also,no surprise to me though,Ive seen him in a small club once trading licks with Bo Didly back in the 80's. So the matter what rollin stones video you buy you won't be dissapointed cause just like 'Merle Haggard, everything they make is top notch!",983836800,,988,4.651428571428571
721659,3,6303905188,"The Bridges to Babylon DVD is MUCH better, but this DVD is good as well.  I guess I was just spoiled because I got the Bridges one first/",969408000,3,137,3.892857142857143
721660,5,6303905188,"As a video document of a performance, Voodoo Lounge beats Bridges To Babylon, or Live At The Max. Despite not being in 5.1, the DVD captures the  raw excitement and swagger of the Stones in Concert and is better paced  than the other two. Plus, you get Bo Diddley in the bargain. I own all  three and attended a Bridges concert, but the Voodoo Lounge DVD is the one  I return to.",945388800,16,379,4.222222222222222
721721,1,6303905188,"I wanted to see the stones in concert as I have been a fan since the 60s. I should have known better expecting Mick to sing like he did so many decades ago. When I view the concert I get the feeling that they are ""just doing a job"" and they are tired and bored with the whole thing. Mick gets tired running around the huge stage and can't seem to sing some the the words without straining. I guess this is the best I can expect out of  ""aging rockers.""",1193529600,,452,3.967032967032967
721722,4,6303905188,"Pictured here in concert are the Rolling Stones in Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium in the early '90s. The South Florida crowd really enjoyed this concert, as you will see and the old codgers - the Stones - didn't disappoint, putting on yet another entertaining show.

I don't remember all the details but I remember this concert was a bit on a raunchy side, with Jagger french-kissing - or pretending to - one of his backup singers during the show and more than a few sexual gyrations by a few people on stage....more than normal.

Other than that, it was the usual exhibit of the incredible vitality the group still has at these performances. One wonders when they peaked, or is that yet to come? Almost all the songs here are good, even if they are so familiar. Facially they make look like they're near the end but ""Not Fade Away"" is appropriate opening number because that describes this band.",1189555200,,892,4.60377358490566
721723,1,6303905188,"This concert sucks!! Horrible sound, boring performance and boring songs. The Stones used to be a great rock'n'roll band but this just show how much they have lost. It all ends with long and booring version of 'Satisfaction'. Who really need to that song played by grandpa?",1122076800,2,273,4.829787234042553
721724,4,6303905188,"To say that the Voodoo Lounge tour was the Stones' best is a strecth, but this is a good concert film. The picture quality is dull and faded. It looks sort of foggy. The sound quality is not that great. The screams are louder than the band! The special guests is interesting. Out of the two special guests Robety Cray is the best one. I have seen him once. If you are a die-hard fan (as I am) this video is something you should have. If you are the casual fan, you should get ""Live at the Max."" All in all, this is a cool film",1093996800,6,526,3.9716981132075473
721725,3,6303905188,"This being the first tour the Rolling Stones did without the irreplaceable Bill Wyman, I, as a bass player myself, was SERIOUSLY interested (and somewhat jealous, in truth) to see how Darryl Jones would do.  Well, he did excellantly, just fine.  And as to the video itself, Whoopie Goldberg is always a treat - just dig her in the ""singalong chorus"" of ""Sweet Virginia""!  The Stones themselves don't sound at ALL bad for 50+ year old men, either.  The cameos are a hoot, too:  Bo Diddly absolutely STEALS THE SHOW when he & the Stones Jam on ""Who Do You Love.""  Robert Cray, though, proves he is a gentleman, when, just listen, HE'S the only one who prevents ""Stop Breakin' Down"" from doing exactly THAT.  The band doesn't ""get it together"" until about halfway through the first chorus.  And I have two major gripes about the show:  first, ""Miss You"" (I song I could go for the rest of eternity without having to endure) lasts about 10 minutes - 7.5 minutes TOO LONG, to be exact.  And on ""Honky Tonk Women,"" the Stones give the the late, great Ian Stewart the ultimate insult by allowing ""auxillary keyboardist"" Chuck Leavell to take a piano solo.  Keef's song is kind of....eh, but the animated introduction to ""Sympathy For The Devil"" makes up for a lot of...things.  (""Voodoo Lounge""....yeah)
Yup, this shows that you don't have to be a 22 year old kid playing a guitar that looks (and sounds) like a Thalidomide baby to do ""Rock and Roll"" anymore.  Long live the Stones!",1067558400,6,1475,4.605363984674329
721726,3,6303905188,"In comparison to the Bridges To Babylon pay per view and DVD, for which they left several songs off of as well as this one, the Voodoo Lounge Miami ppv and DVD is horrible. The show captured the excitement of the opening numbers but missed with some of the key tracks being left off. With DVD having much more room than VHS, one would think they'd put the tracks that were taken off back in. This one is good to own for one reason - Keith's mind blowing screw up for his solo in ""Sympathy For The Devil"". Not only did he not realise what he was doing and how awful he was doing it, not one person in the band noticed his wrong notes! It's displays such as this and the entire Let's Spend The Night Together film that make the Rolling Stones beautiful when it comes to screwing up! Highly entertaining.",1061424000,2,801,4.241830065359477
721727,2,6303905188,"Those of you who were at the Thanksgiving concert will know that this concert went for a LOT longer than 95 minutes, and what a killer set list it was !!
Where as the Bridges to Babylon concert was left uncut, this  Voodoo Lounge performance is pretty much butchered.  Great songs like ""Monkey Man"",""Beast Of Burden"",""Before they Make Me Run"",""Live With Me"" (guest vocals: Sheryl Crow !) and quite a few others deserved to be kept for this release.
Hopefully the awesome HBO Madison Suare Gardens concert in January 2003(40 Licks tour) will be released uncut like the Babylon DVD.
Still, what remains is a good looking concert, and shows the Stones proving they can keep up the pace post-Steel Wheels. This DVD would've gotten a higher rating if the full concert had been included with 5.1 surround sound though.",1058832000,12,812,4.792857142857143
721728,5,6303905188,"and thats why it's been sold out for ages and ages.....
I have both the DVD and the VHS cassette and the DVD of course blows the casette out of the water but mostly because it is THE medium made for concerts like Voodoo lounge .....
Not only do the stones do their hottest and best cuts without cheating the audience but Mick puts on a show that I would consider would tire a professional NFL receiver. With the stage spanning the length of the football field, Mick not only runs, hops and skips from one side to the other ALL NIGHT LONG but he does it belting out his numerous and fabulous hits.
I was fortunate enough to be at the concert in Miami while HBO was taking this DVD and I tell you the atmosphere was electric ....
This DVD is going up with 'The Dance' from Fleetwood Mack as being number ONE in  my book ......",1009411200,6,824,4.182389937106918
721729,5,6303905188,cheryl crow was also a guest at this pay per view how come she was ommitrd  i have original but was damaged  is this an oversight or was she ommited from this copy,1006300800,,163,3.909090909090909
721730,5,6303905188,"Even though I feel the Rolling Stones are not quite as sharp on this concert DVD as on the ""Live at the Max"" or the ""Bridges to Babylon"" concert DVDs, it is still well worth owning.
For some peculiar reason, the Stones on this DVD look more haggard (exception drummer Charlie Watts) than they did three years later on the ""Babylon"" concert.  Perhaps they were tired and that might be why their energy level wasn't as high here.  However, there are still many highlights including ""Angie,"" ""Sweet Virginia,"" (both performed on the small stage) ""It's All Over Now,"" and the guest appearance of Bo Diddley for the number ""Who Do You Love.""  Furthermore, the mixing of this concert is vastly superior to the DVD of ""Babylon"" which was an atrocity.  You can actually clearly hear the band without the distortion which marred the latter DVD.
There is only one lowlight on this DVD, and that is the baffling decision by the producers of this concert to employ so-called comic Whoopi Goldberg to act as emcee.  She is an embarrassment in her brief appearances, including actually ""singing"" with the Stones' professional backup singers near the end of the concert.  She can keep her day job, thank you.  Fortunately, her antics aren't bad enough to ruin this otherwise excellent concert.  Every fan should own this DVD.",1004745600,7,1310,4.816964285714286
7854163,5,6303905188,"This is a good antidote to the 24-year head scratcher, Voodoo Lounge CD. The presentation has ambience, depth and interest at all times, but you also get close-ups of everybody at the right times, never lingering too long or just a hit-shot.

Not looking at the opening credits because I thought there was only the 90s VIP guests I got a boost, seeing Bo Diddley, coming out to sing and play and finding a way to give the Sound engine some extra guitar charge, Very welcome. Charlie Watts gives Mick a bright smile, to begin with, and throughout Keith and others share personal smiles of enjoyment--Mick even looks like he Misses You.",1504137600,,634,4.660714285714286

7854169,5,6303905188,"Did not care for ""Love Is Strong"" but the rest of the cd is top notch  in my book! I've been a fan for fifty years,but the CDs and live performances have been spectacular. I have seen them in person first in 1972 (at my undergraduate alma mater),and then in 1998, 2000, and right after the release of ""A Bigger Bang."".I've seen them emerge from gutty rock stars to true showmen, They play a fabulous show and keep you standing on you feet clapping and singing along. My wish is that they would play more of the new material from ""Voo Doo"" and ""Bridges to Babylon"" and even ""A Bigger Bang.""

7854171,2,6303905188,"Being a HUGE Stones fan I had to have this DVD, but I had avoided buying this when it was available at retailers at $14.99 because it was an edited concert.

Why Monkey Man, Can't You Hear Me Knockin, Before They Make Me Run, Beast Of Burden and Live With Me (guest Vocal Sheryl Crow) were omitted are a mystery and make this a very disappointing release. To add insult to injury, the concert is presented in full screen with no 5.1 audio.

Aside from that, the concert is pretty lively and everyone seems to be having a good time, but it should have been released in its entirety. There is certainly enough space on this DVD as there isn't anything on here but a hour and 34 minute concert. The menu is totally no frills, one still screen where you can either pick a song or start it from the beginning.

This is a pretty sad release for such a noteworthy band. In the day of re-re-released ""deluxe"" editions, why this hasn't been re-mastered in 5.1 and HD, released as a full concert is beyond me. I'm sure every Stones fan would buy the revised corrected version...Right? Especially considering the second market price of this POS.",1379376000,3,1134,4.468599033816425
