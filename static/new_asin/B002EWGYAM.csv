3919624,5,B002EWGYAM,"...but, to quote Spencer Tracy's line from ""Pat and Mike,"" ""what's there, is cherce.""

How can you pick highlights from highlights?: The final duet from ""Chenier,"" sung by two of Spain's greatest gifts to the world of music, Caballe and Carerras? McCracken, returning to the Met after a five-year absence, to bring down the house with Otello's great ""Dio mi potevi""? Freni and Domingo's ""Otello"" Duet? Price and Pav's from ""Ballo""? The mind reels with a feast of the finest. This was the creme de la creme of the opera world, circa 1983.

Only a couple of minor cavils: Couldn't they have retained Osie Hawkins' introduction of the guests of honor in the second half (Rise Stevens and Marilyn Horne embracing after the latter's ""Mon Ceur,"" Feruccio Tagliavini looking hopelessly bored during the ""Faust"" trio)? How about Moffo and Merrill's co-farewell to the house with ""Will You Remember?""?

But this is comparitively minor. What remains is truly an operatic feast of the finest.",1253836800,11,981,5.006134969325154
3919625,5,B002EWGYAM,"I, too, have been crossing my fingers every day since I read ""Operaman's"" review above. Been waiting for years for a complete version of that Met's fantastic celebration.  I check the DG Site daily and today I saw that they added more details...the Track Listings for DVD #1 and DVD #2.  So, apparently, there are two DVDs....BUT.....DG simply divided the old Pioneer version into the new DG version.  Same selections and timings.  I did pre-order it anyway because I'm sure that the Video and Audio will be far better than the old one.  I can't imagine that DG will be issuing a more complete version...so this is gonna be it for all of us Met lovers.  If anyone finds and my information is wrong, please let me know and correct me.  Thanks.",1252886400,25,742,4.575757575757576
3919626,4,B002EWGYAM,"Problem with this disc is the same that I have with a lot of Amazon cds and dvds in that there's no way to see what exactly is on the cd or dvd.  In this case:  it wasn't apparent that this dvd is only highlights and that should have been made abundantly clear.  The title suggests that this is the gala and it most certainly is not  Some of your favorite  moments may not be included, I know that some of mine weren't.  This is a flaw in Amazon's system that would appear to be an easy fix, we get much more product informstion in-store than we do on-line with Amazon.",1417996800,4,569,4.081081081081081
3919627,5,B002EWGYAM,"Each day now we learn of some old movie or other video production that has been reissued on Blu Ray. Even this two disc version of the October 1983 Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala contains only about half of the total performance that was broadcast on PBS at two in the afternoon and eight in the evening on that day. This has been previously offered on VHS, then Laser Disc and now DVD. Some years ago I found on Ebay the original program of that afternoon and evening's performances and I purchased a copy. I was astounded at the performers not included on these two DVDs; Norman, Thomas, Jones, Lear, Stewart, Crespin, Milnes, Morris, Cassilly, Quilico, Plishka, Winbergh, Devia, Daniels, Neblett, Estes, MacNeil, Arroyo, Dunn, Moffo, Merrill, Elias, Resnik, Hines, Amara, Cossoto, and Shicoff. While the 1991 and 1996 Met Galas were superlative productions neither approaches the length and the number of outstanding MET Opera performers that participated in the 1983 Gala. This Gala should be reissued on Blu Ray in its entirely and in the order in which the performances occurred. Five stars are given for the quality of what is shown, but, a huge goose egg is posted for what is excluded!",1416873600,4,1198,4.906403940886699
3919628,4,B002EWGYAM,"These performances were very enjoyable - just wished there'd been more solo singing (arias) done by the stars like Domingo, Pavarotti, Price, Te Kanawa, etc.",1408579200,,157,5.32
3919629,5,B002EWGYAM,Thanks!,1408579200,,7,7.0
3919630,5,B002EWGYAM,This DVD is truly a outstanding collection of talented stars and memorable music from your favorite operas. A gala celebration of the best in operatic music.,1388275200,,157,5.076923076923077

No problem also transport
I am glad that precious thing is available
Thank you",1388188800,,120,4.761904761904762
3919632,5,B002EWGYAM,Young people today should indeed view this disc so that they can know what truly great voices can do. The solo arias and ensemble singing presented in this disc no longer exist.,1383177600,2,177,4.5625
3919633,5,B002EWGYAM,"This video is simply wonderful!  You opera lovers out there should not miss this one!  Since it arrived,  I have viewed it four times and loved every minute of it.  The truly great stars of the Met perform.  One can tell the audience knows them,  too,  in the tremendous applause they give as they come on stage and the applause and shouts of ""bravo!"" at the end of their performances.  WOW!",1372723200,4,391,4.408450704225352
3919634,5,B002EWGYAM,What can you say?  An excellent historical view of the Met with a cast a singers who have yet to be replaced by the current roster. There is no Nilsson or Price at the Met today.  Every opera enthusiast should have this historical record.  Where is the Zinka Milanov of today?,1368057600,3,276,4.372549019607843
3919635,5,B002EWGYAM,"The remastering of the same footage that is on the Pioneer DVD by DG is magnificent.  The color correction and detail that comes from putting the performance on two discs make it almost HD quality when viewed uncompressed with a BluRay player.  The Pioneer version is washed out and shows little detail.

Since the Centennial is the best collection of great singers on DVD, it's a must for opera lovers.  The Levine 25th comes close.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolitan-Opera-Gala-James-Levine-s-25th-Anniversary/dp/B0009DBXX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolitan Opera Gala - James Levine's 25th Anniversary</a>

The Volpe Gala was wonderful.  Will it ever come out on DVD?",1366848000,,729,6.463917525773196
3919644,4,B002EWGYAM,The music is beautiful although I expected more familiar areas.  The main thing I would complain about is the lack of identifying each singer. Only the name of the area is shown.,1357948800,5,178,4.5625
3919645,5,B002EWGYAM,"Can't tell you how much I enjoyed going back in time - not that long ago, but to a time when we were in our own golden age of talented opera stars.  This won't happen again for another hundred years. It was just a joy to hear all those who were part of my life. From McCracken to Pavarotti. There simply isn't anyone out there now to match any of them.  I loved all the concerts from the 80s and 90s, and this has to one of the best. See Domingo and Freni in Otello.... Von Stade and Blegen in Rosenkavelier....I could go on and on. This was a joy. Can I use that word 'JOY' often enough.",1307232000,5,588,3.9745762711864407
3919646,5,B002EWGYAM,Here you have the best performers alive of the last 60 years with unique exibition of their best creations. Obligation to have for all what are involved in the best Opera performances in one of the best theatres all over the world,1284854400,2,230,4.5
3919647,4,B002EWGYAM,"The video  is exactly the same as the original vhs tape.  Regretfully , no company has dare issue the entire broadcast program yet. Maybe, it will come to light one day. Sound is excellent and picture quality has improved a lot .. I do recommend it",1283040000,8,248,4.369565217391305
3919648,5,B002EWGYAM,"This is a 2009 release of a 1983 telecast. As such, the video and audio quality is astonishingly good. Please note: some other reviews refer to an earlier release - there's nothing wrong with the sound on this one - DTS 5.1 is perfectly acceptable; one might say excellent. It's like a visit to the Eighties, in a time machine.

There are some superb performances on this disk.

Watching a very young Levine conducting the overture to The Bartered Bride, with frenetic zeal, is a joy to behold.
Eva Marton's Turandot shows her superb voice at its best.
(and so on... those are just the first two tracks, and there are many more).

Rather than bore you with an exhaustive list, here are a few highlights (at least the ones that affected me - your results may vary):
Joan Sutherland singing 'Bel raggio lusinghier', conducted by an adoring Bonynge
An outstanding performance of Mascagni's 'Son io, Son io la vita', sung by the Met Chorus, conducted by David Stivender, Chorusmaster (a piece which I didn't know, but now intend to look into. It brought the proverbial shiver down my spine).
Bernstein, conducting the overture to Leonore
Levine conducting Carreras and Caball in Andrea Chenier
Birgit Nilsson in 'Wie lachend sie mir Lieder singer', the only Wagner of the evening.

Oh dear; I'm back to listing tracks again.

Bottom line: if you love opera, and the Met, buy it.

(Just one quibble: according to the sleeve notes, the original was eight hours. The DVD only had four. When can we see the rest?)",1278460800,20,1505,4.7251908396946565
3919649,3,B002EWGYAM,"For younger opera fans who loudy cheer today's mediocrities who disgrace the opera stage, here's a glimpse of what real singing - and the Met - was all about. Unfortunately, the gala came too late to show the prime of Robert Merrill, Anna Moffo, or Roberta Peters to stay nothing of Richard Tucker and Jan Peerce. However, what they do have is far and away superior to what is cheered today.

Even tho it's not the complete gala (an all-day telecast, matinee plus evening) grab it and see what you're missing. Now if DG REALLY wanted to do us a favour, they'd release the 1983 Gala complete as well as the complete Bing Gala from 1972. They recorded it (1 LP was released and a second announced but never released) so they cergtainly have the audio if not the video as well. And the singing in 1972 eclisped 1983 by a good deal!",1262131200,18,828,4.411764705882353
3919650,4,B002EWGYAM,"This should have been listed as excerts from Centenial Gala. I had assumed that, since it contained 2 DVDs and you can fit about 8 hours on 2 double layer DVDs, that it would contain the whole gala. But it only contains about half the gala, which is very dasappointing. It was a very good performance and, considering it was recorded 1983, both the video and audio are very good. Audio has been upgraded to dts5.1 in addition to stereo.",1256860800,23,436,4.4625
3919651,3,B002EWGYAM,"This video is a disappointment because it merely takes the same material from the older versions single disk and spreads it over two disks. The original video had drastically edited the afternoon and evening performances of this gala. I bought this two dvd version assuming that more performances had been added when I saw that the original single disk had been expanded to two disks. If you have the single disk version, don't bother getting this one",1256256000,26,451,4.87012987012987
3919652,4,B002EWGYAM,"It's amazing that the Met is over 100 years old.  Great singers, conductors and directors have helped it become the pre-eminent opera house in the world.  All of the performances are excellent though I wish that they would look to their archives and show arias from past singers such as Beverly Sills , Jussi Bjorling, Lilly Pons, Rise Stevens.  I know that they have video recordings but they see reluctant to release them.",1255737600,5,424,4.780821917808219
3919653,5,B002EWGYAM,"I have the ""old"" Pioneer Classics DVD version, lasting 231 minutes. The ""new"" DGG version lasts........231 minutes. So it must be the same coverage. I don't know why DGG went to the trouble of duplicating the existing version. Better picture? Better sound? I don't think I will spend money (although not too much for this DVD) to see whether picture and sound are any better(no complaints on the Pioneer DVD).
I have asked DGG whether they had any intention to issue a DVD-version of the ""Metropolitan Opera Gala 1991 - 25th Anniversary at Lincoln Center"", of which I have the VHS. That is the one with the 3 excerpts from RIGOLETTO, OTELLO and DIE FLEDERMAUS plus a number of arias. This is often mixed up with the ""Metropolitan Opera Gala, celebrating James Levine's 25th Anniversary"", which took place in 1996 (2 DGG DVDs). DGG said no intention. Unbelievable!",1254960000,15,863,4.837837837837838
8368358,1,B002EWGYAM,Not at all satisfied with this order. Inside was a copy of the Magic Flute nothing like what the cover suggest. I have several Magic Flutes and really not interested in owning another,1518652800,,183,4.575757575757576

8368365,1,B002EWGYAM,"This is a rip off, plain and simple. The Centennial was 7-8 hours in length and this is about 1/3 of the original. I have great respect for the Metropolitan Opera Chorus and Corps de Ballet but to insert their performances as a replacement for the outstanding international stars of opera is unforgivable. The Met and PBS have a responsibility to negotiate as necessary with all participants and bring this historic event to the public as has been clamored for the past 35+ years. Until they do, this item should be boycotted.",1442966400,2,526,4.728260869565218
