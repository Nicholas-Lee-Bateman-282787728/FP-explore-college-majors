The average person may not have the proper tools to take this apart, or be able to find the battery compartment, or put it back together. After pulling the screws it comes apart in multiple pieces, after finally replacing the batteries most people don't keep in there house, it doesn't even spin very well or long, total junk and waste of money.",1451088000,,422,4.64
