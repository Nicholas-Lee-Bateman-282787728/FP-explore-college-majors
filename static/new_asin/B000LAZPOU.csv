8160582,5,B000LAZPOU,"This is a great documentary about Dr. Peale, and you won't believe all the great people who knew him and say great things about him!  Some of the highest people you know will tell you how this incredible person helped them!  This dvd even lets you hear what some who didn't like him has to say, thus letting you make up your own mind as to what to think.  That is very rare today because all the news channels are so bias.  This is a great dvd!  It tells his incredible whole life story!  Thanks",1437609600,,495,4.157894736842105
