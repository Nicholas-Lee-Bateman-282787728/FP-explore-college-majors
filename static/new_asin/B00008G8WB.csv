1846074,5,B00008G8WB,"I purchased the Brainy Baby Right Brain and Left Brain and began playing them for my son when he was about 4 months old.  As he got older he seemed to lose some interest.  At 8 months old I notice my son taking interest in music.  So, one day at the store I saw this DVD.  I purchsed it and it has been a huge hit.  My son watches it two to three times a day.  Every morning I put it in when he eats his breakfast and he gets so excited.  At 10 months old now he has started to dance to the music.  I love the way this explains different instruments, sounds, and types of music it is diffently educational.",1094428800,4,606,3.9098360655737703
1846075,5,B00008G8WB,"As usual, my kids LOVE this latest Brainy Baby product. It has terrific songs, darling kids, and best of all, it actually teaches them about Music! The ""rhythm"" example with kids walking, running, skipping, etc. to different beats is so cute - my 2 yr old always jumps up & down and laughs out loud! And the surprisingly beautiful sounds of a barbershop quartet (teaching about harmony, tempo, etc.) literally make my kids stop what ever they're doing and listen in fascination.
I highly recommend it - your child will love it, too!",1073952000,20,532,4.731182795698925
1846116,5,B00008G8WB,"I came across Brainy Baby because of a friend. I was told that Brainy Baby will give you a free DVD to try (you pay shipping-mine was $6.95). Since Sydney loves anything musical, I decided that the Brainy Baby Music DVD was the one I would choose. It is labeled for kids ages 2-5 and states that it will introduce your child to rhythm and tempo, melody and harmony, and musical instruments.

I assumed it was going to be similar to Baby Einstein (which Sydney still loves), but I was completely wrong. The Brainy Baby Music DVD is quite different. They sing a lot of songs and play a lot of different instruments. They go through a lot of musical terms and name the types of music (country, blues, etc.). Sydney really likes this DVD a lot! They have kids that sing and play the instruments, and it is pretty fast-paced to keep kids attention.

I have been very impressed with this company overall! The DVDs have been proven recently to promote learning in toddlers and I think most kids would enjoy the DVDs. I don't think t.v. time should take the place of sitting down and playing / teaching your kids, but it's nice to know your kids are watching something educational when they watch t.v. and Brainy Baby DVDs are good for that!

I highly recommend you take advantage of the free DVD from Brainy Baby, and while you're there check out their clearance section (they usually have some great deals) and sign up for the newsletter. They send out emails about big sales (usually 60% off sales)!!",1268006400,,1495,4.529629629629629
1846117,5,B00008G8WB,My little girl is 18 months and loves this movie.  She even picked up on soe of the hand movements and does them on her own.,1241136000,,124,3.769230769230769
1846118,1,B00008G8WB,"Although this DVD is very educational, much of it is not interesting to a one, two or even three year old.  An older child may thoroughly enjoy it however. The lessons are presented in short increments but not the most exciting manner. If you have a little one, check out the ""Trebellina"" DVD instead.  Not only are little kids riveted, but they actually learn more advanced material (like how to read written note music -- yes, really -- and pitch training) than on this DVD.  It is all in the way it is presented.  From a parents' perspective, the music on Trebellina is really fun as well.  My toddler liked Brainy Baby but LOVED Trebellina and learned much more from it.  She was reading music at 3 yo and started taking piano lessons.  Her teachers were amazed at what she already knew, how good her ear was, and how quickly she picked up concepts.  If you want your little one to learn music, look at another product but keep this in mind for an older child.",1201996800,11,964,4.4375
1846119,5,B00008G8WB,"My son LOVES this DVD, and has liked it since he started seeing short segments of it from our cable company's On Demand feature. He probably started watching the pieces around age 2 and he just turned 4. He's always been interested in music so this is right up his alley. My daughter is 20 months and also enjoys it but definitely does not understand the content -- she just likes watching the kids play music and dancing to it. Would recommend if your child has any interest in real music (instruments, types of music, playing music) and is old enough to pay attention, otherwise it would be wasted on them. The music is upbeat and fun, the videography is good (except the rock & roll segment makes me dizzy -- at least it's short), and the concepts are presented very simply for kids in the 2-5 age group.",1201046400,,807,4.422818791946309
1846120,5,B00008G8WB,"My daughter has been watching this DVD since she was 18 months old. She is now 3 and still asks for it every now and again. The original songs created for the DVD are really good (I cannot stand them myself but my daughter loves, loves, loves them, and that's what it's all about, right?) Anyway, don't worry about your baby not ""getting"" it. Sure they talk about advanced concepts like pitch and tempo, but they make it very interesting. It is also a good introduction to the different musical instruments and various types of music (rock, blues, etc.)",1130544000,10,553,4.595959595959596

1846122,5,B00008G8WB,"The people at Brainy Baby has got it right AGAIN! They really know what they are doing 'coz my 20 month old really loves all her BB DVDs especially this one on music. Though it's recommended for 2 yrs & up, she enjoyed it the moment it was introduced to her at 17 months. And till now, she's still not sick of it. I too, enjoy watching it, it's both entertaining & informative. 2 Thumbs Up!!",1111190400,2,391,4.157894736842105
1846123,5,B00008G8WB,My daughter took to this video from 2.5 years old. Now 3 it is her favourite video - although she loves music. If your child is interested in pianos or music I could not recommend this product highly enough. The little boy singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star out of tune a bit makes her smile every time. A great mix of information and songs. Would love more Brainy Baby videos for older kids.,1109462400,3,393,4.397260273972603
1846124,3,B00008G8WB,"The concepts in this DVD are far too advanced for a baby.  The film covers subjects such as tempo, rhythm, genres of music, etc., and there is a large amount of narration.  For educational purposes, it would probably work best for children ages 3 and up.  This is not to say a baby will not take interest in the sounds and images; my one year old enjoyed many sections of the video simply because she likes music and likes watching other children.  Other portions were unable to hold her interest, however, and the information was certainly beyond her grasp.",1105142400,7,558,4.606060606060606
1846125,2,B00008G8WB,"My 2.5yr old son owns almost all of the Brainy Baby DVDs (he's got 10 of them) so when I saw this DVD and read the positive reviews I bought it and Brainy Baby Art. When we received it I sat my son down and watched it with him. He just was NOT interested in this video. After a few minutes he went off and started playing with his toys. At 2 he's not interested in knowing wind instruments, string instruments, quartets, harmony, etc. My son loves music and he loves making music on his keyboard and he owns alot of musical instruments he loves playing. This video seemed a bit to advanced to be understood by a 2 or 3yr old unless they're gifted. I'm going to put this video up and try it when my son's 3.5 or 4yrs old. If you've got a 2yr old who's interested in music I'd suggest ""Blue's Big Musical"" wich is more toddler friendly. He LOVES that DVD.",1096675200,15,853,4.144578313253012

7983637,5,B00008G8WB,"I like most Brainy Baby items...as a teaching or learning tool. Babies can listen to this, I always played all kinds of music to my children when they were small, and they turned out to be very bright. (They didn't have Brainy Babies when my children were small), so yes, I'd recommend this to anyone who wanted their child to learn even as a baby.",1390262400,,348,4.369230769230769

7983639,3,B00008G8WB,"This DVD gives MIXED RESULTS

The GOOD RESULT

It cleverly and visually explains the concepts of rhythm, tempo, melody and harmony. There are exercises right after that for the kids to practice. They're easy and fun to do.

The BAD RESULT

At the back of the DVD cover, it says ""Special Features: Sing Alongs"". However, there are only 2 songs with lyrics displayed on screen for singing along. Moreover, they are hidden in Extra section. These songs are bad, not interesting to sing.

In the main section, there are many interesting songs but they have no lyrics displayed on screen. Consequently, we can't sing along. I think as a music DVD for kids, it should have on-screen lyrics so that the kids can sing along while watching it. In this regard, Sing-along DVDs by Sesame Street and VeggieTales are better.

Because of this, I gave it 3 stars.",1347494400,2,848,4.695945945945946
