7177332,4,B00XPKHQ04,It is interesting. It is about Gentiles adopting Jewish culture without the background information.,1444348800,,99,6.142857142857143
7177333,5,B00XPKHQ04,"The movie portrayed a wonderful ending.  Can't give away too much, just watch it for yourself!",1443398400,,94,4.875
7177334,5,B00XPKHQ04,"Great message for believers and those in search! Far from a Hollywood production, but the message is far more important.",1442880000,,120,5.05
7177335,3,B00XPKHQ04,Not quite what I expected.  Theology a little confusing.  Sorry - cannot grant higher rating.,1441497600,,93,5.133333333333334
8716398,5,B00XPKHQ04,It gets THE message of Salvation in the real Name of the Savior (Yahshua) across. Excellent story plot which reflects what one experiences while  trying to live a set aside life would encounter.,1527897600,,194,4.878787878787879
8716399,5,B00XPKHQ04,Love this movie. Watched it several times on TV then ordered it to pass on to others,1526774400,,84,4.0
8716400,1,B00XPKHQ04,"So...yeah.  Don't waste your money on this.  Low production values, the volume seems to change depending on whom is speaking and what point in the film they're speaking.  That's before you get into the actual use of Jewish things in the film.  I was constantly hitting pause and texting some Jewish friends with questions, most of the replies to which, I can't post here due to Amazon's review content standards, but can basically be summed up as, ""No, that's not how that works.""

They're also quite fond of reading in this movie, and doing entire scenes only to show people reading.  I understand reading to try to better grasp faith, but it works poorly in the medium of film.",1492819200,,679,4.663865546218488
8716401,1,B00XPKHQ04,"I know there are people who truly believe the line of thought this film espouses is helping others- that's it's literally saving their souls. I would like to express why that is disrespectful to other faiths. This line of thinking essentially claims that Christianity is the only way to be a person of faith and that every other religion on the planet - estimated at over 4,000 belief systems around the world - are at best either misguided or deficient.

Specific to this movie: Christianity and Judaism are different faiths that can and do coexist in peace. However, being a Christian (one who accepts Jesus as Savior) and also adopting traditional Jewish customs means you are a Christian who also practices Jewish customs, not Jewish. I know Messianic Christians who keep Kosher and the Sabbath because it makes them feel closer to Jesus to live as he lived. That is absolutely beautiful, and these people have found a fulfilling way to express their Christian faith. I have also heard missionaries who claim that accepting Jesus makes you ""a completed Jew"" because the New Testament grows out of the Torah. However, there are so many differences between the two, and so many differences between the Torah and the translations found in the the New Testament that accepting Christianity means accepting a completely new religious doctrine. (For example, Judaism has no concept of the Messiah being born of a virgin - which is a very important point in Christianity.) It would similar to claiming that only becoming a Mormon makes you ""a completed Christian"" because, to its followers, the Book of Mormon holds further revelations from the same source as the Torah and Gospels. Or that becoming a Muslim makes you a ""completed Christian"" because Muslims believe the Quran is also a further revelation from the same source. If those last two sentences give you pause, and you're saying to yourself that the Bible can stand on it's own and doesn't need further revelations, then you know how it feels to be told that your faith is incomplete. (It's not very nice.) I hope this review helps reframe the issue of conversions for those who have only ever thought it to be a good thing.",1485216000,,2182,4.849865951742627
8716402,1,B00XPKHQ04,"I don't know how to keep polite in this review so I'll try to keep my language clean...

 The self aggrandizing writer says ""Jewish people don't have to desert their Jewishness to accept Jesus""

That's literally what becoming Christian is because in accepting Christ you are embracing Christianity in place of ""jewishness"".  This truly is antisemetic, self-absorbed and creepy.

Also don't get me started on the warped, ill-conceived and misguided nature of having the protagonist codemn a book series (Harry Potter) just because it has the use of magic in it. You can't preach ""keep an open mind"" while telling people to burn a book series. That's literally the opposite of open mindedness!",1482710400,2,691,5.079646017699115

8716407,1,B00XPKHQ04,"Full of ugly caricatures of Jewish people, and a completely bonkers message about Christian magic and conversion based on imaginary reasons.  It's shameful and ugly and would be more harmful if it wasn't so stupid and silly.  Nice look into the twisted mind of a certain set of evangelicals, and why they think hocus-pocus = religion.  I respect Christianity.  I don't respect hateful ideas that pretend to be about teaching.",1454025600,9,425,5.0285714285714285
