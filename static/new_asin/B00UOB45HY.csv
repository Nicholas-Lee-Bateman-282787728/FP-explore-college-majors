8707757,5,B00UOB45HY,"This order was delivered on time and in an Amazon box with protective air pockets inside. It was in great condition. No scratches or anything like that. They are also both excellent movies, in my opinion (but that may just be because I think Mel Gibson was a real cutie XD). Very good purchase. I recommend it.",1475798400,,310,4.456140350877193
