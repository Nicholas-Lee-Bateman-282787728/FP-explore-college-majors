5037010,3,B006YEQ6FO,"This video is fine but the quality is that of someone who used their home camera or a VHS tape form the 80s. That being said, it's fine. I wouldn't get it for anyone as a gift though, the packaging is not that great.",1391990400,,216,3.9318181818181817
5037011,5,B006YEQ6FO,"while i understand that this video may not be for everyone (it is not exactly a follow-along / exercise video), i thought that it was very inspirational in terms of the example that it sets. it presents yoga as an opportunity to bond with your child, introduce him or her to a slower pace of life, a communion with nature, and a respect for real connection between humans, nature, and the ancient art of yoga... the video is shot with an emphasis on the natural world that yoga is supposed to help your body attune to, restoration to its most elemental defaults... in essence, this video is more of a map or blueprint to help you find your own connection to yoga with your family, as opposed to a regimented set of instructions. there are many ways to learn and be inspired, and i'm sure this will appeal to many people as much as it did to me and my family. namaste.",1365033600,3,867,4.3580246913580245
5037012,2,B006YEQ6FO,I've done yoga for more than 15 years but this was the first time I was introducing it to my five year old daughter to it and it was a disaster. It's not instruction but rather a vaguely creepy home movie with no pose explanation or preemting to give you a chance to help your child transition between moves. Frequently the camera is focused on the grass for no reason what so ever so you can't even see if you are positioned correctly.,1361750400,7,436,4.265060240963855
5037013,3,B006YEQ6FO,"My three year old and I watched this together. We love doing yoga together, but the narration of this threw her off. Because the voice is a child, not a teacher, and because the voice is not connected to the video, it is hard to follow and feel confident about what's coming next. We didn't enjoy it and I wouldn't recommend it for children my daughter's age. Perhaps children older would enjoy it.",1332547200,4,398,4.465753424657534
5037014,5,B006YEQ6FO,"I rented this on Amazon Video on Demand tonight. When I first started to watch this video I was thinking it wasn't going to be that great, because I could tell it was produced on a low budget. I am really glad I stuck with it. My 6 year old daughter, who has a hard time calming down for bed and who is very picky about other yoga videos I have tried, loved it. She enjoyed the interaction with me and I felt it was a positive bonding experience for us and really helped her to calm down before bed as well.

For my own yoga workout, I would have wanted to hold the poses longer and have more description of technique, but for a child, I think that it was perfect to keep their attention and participation going.  The workout was satisfying for myself too with some advanced poses and very nice stretches. It included poses where the mother and daughter did the pose together (leaning against one another, connecting feet and hands together) but also many more side by side poses. The entire video is narrated in a child like voice in the person of the daughter who speaks of the day of doing yoga with her mom. The interaction with the mother and daughter is very sweet and genuine and the setting is just beautiful, up in the mountains in a field of wild flowers. Occasionally shots of horses or cows or nature is shown as the narrator comments on the the sights and sounds around her and describes the poses as they go along and pleasant music plays in the background.

This is really a one on one video unless you pause the video to do the collaborative poses with more than one child. I would recommend it for ages 5 and up, though younger ones would still probably enjoy it.",1327536000,15,1680,4.326984126984127

8506443,5,B006YEQ6FO,"I thought it was pretty lame, but my 7-year old and my 5-year old love this. They wake up in the mornings and ask if they can work out before breakfast, so it seems to be effective. For that reason, I'll put my personal bias aside and rate it 5 stars on their behalf.",1434931200,3,267,3.962962962962963
