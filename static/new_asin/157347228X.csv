194664,1,157347228X,"The movie starts when these annoying yuppies go to a prison. One of the yuppies performs a ritual that's suppose to scare the other yuppies. But it was a joke. OH but the ritual actually DID did raise a whopping 3 zombies from the ground and they hunt down and kill those fools (YES! THEY ALL MUST DIE!!!!!! I ACTUALLY WISH THEY KILLED THEM IN REAL LIFE!!!!!) and turns them into zombies as well. :) So one final yuppie survives the whole thing and that's all! THE END!
OK! I HATE THIS FILM WITH SUCH BURNING HATRED!!!! The acting is so annoying, I actually punched the T.V. to try and shut them up! Especially that one yuppie who kept licking his lips (that should tell you something). Everything about this movie is stupid!!!!!!
(not many zombies)
most entertaining part: when all those yuppies DIE!!!!!!!
PEACE, and RESPECT :)",1064361600,,829,4.608108108108108
194665,3,157347228X,"I just saw this movie on the SciFi Channel. The name and description my dish network gave to describe the movie mislead me into believing it would be something I'd like. This movie is lacking in many areas.
The story has no flow to it. Things just seem to happen at random. The initial awakening of the zombies, for example, made no sense to me. Maybe I missed something, or possibly a part was cut to make the movie fit into the television timeslot, but it seemed really random. Some blood drops from a statue of a dog or a gargoyle or something like that onto the ground. The dirt then begins to move and three zombies come out from under it, with no reason given for the blood to have been there in the first place. There's plenty of other things that are odd and don't quite fit in well, but I won't mention them because I don't want to give away the story.
The special effects in this movie are also a bit short of amazing. The zombies look terrible and the scenes in which humans are possessed by the souls of witches are quite bad as well. Various other small things, like the glowing red eyes of the undead look horribly fake.
This movie is not completely terrible, considering the fact I actually watched the whole thing. The initial idea for the story seems to be pretty good, but the final script is definitely flawed. I thought the sets used in the film were really cool, and the death scenes were pretty neat as well. I've seen plenty of horror movies that are much better than this, but I've also seen a ton of them that are much, much worse. As a movie in general, The Prison of the Dead is sub-par at best. But when compared to other horror movies, especially recent ones, this movie isn't too bad.",1058313600,2,1714,4.326086956521739
194666,2,157347228X,"First of all, this movie is not scary at all.  The characters walk around the prison until they are frozen in place at random and then killed.  You do not feel for any of the characters, and you can't even cheer them on since they just get stuck where they are before you even know they are in danger and then it is over for them.  This film is a great example of horror writers who have no education on the basic elements of horror.
Why should you even check this film out?  This film is quite progressive on the issue of sexual minorities.  There are three bisexual guys in the film.  One who hits on another character, while the other two reflect upon their sexual history with each other.  It comes as quite a surprise in this film because it seemed to come out of nowhere.  It inadvertently normalizes the experience of sexual minorities and is worth viewing for that reason alone.",1034467200,17,886,4.392638036809816
194667,1,157347228X,"I was going to give this movie a harsh review, then I noticed the single review that already existed for this movie. The person loved it! So I thought that perhaps I had selected the wrong movie. There is no picture for it listed.
But just in case there is only ONE Prison Of The Dead let me just say this. No action, no killing, no prisoners! If this is the movie I remember,then the only good part about it was that at the end they interviewed eact actor.  It was sooooooo funny, because these actors were taking the interview so seriously, like they were on Johnny Carson's tonight show (the movie seems that old). Anyway, do not waste your time on this one.  I'm off to find a good movie to review now.",1012176000,2,706,4.2611940298507465

194669,3,157347228X,"Now a days its hard to find decent horror movies, however iam a big fan of the b movie genre anyways. So, i headed down to the video store and Prison of the dead caught my eye. The tagline ""Theres no parole in hell"" seemed interesting and it was a full moon so i gave it a whirl. The acting was not all that bad and the 3 prison guards looked decent. However the scares and the gore were just not there. I suppose the director elected to have the viewer use their imagination on the kill scenes (blah!). If you like some plot twists and an overall errie feel give it a chance.",981158400,,576,4.06140350877193
194670,2,157347228X,"What happens when former high school friends turned occult researchers reunite for a classmate's funeral? What happens when an outside party shows up with their own plans? What happens when corpses rise and start killing everyone in their path? I dunno but I'd like to see it. At least I thought I would till I sat through Prison of the Dead. The friends arrive at the Hawthorne funeral home, only the corpse on display isn't dead, yet. It's just a prank planned by Kristoff and the corpse, Calvin. Kristoff explains to Allie, Michelle, and Rory that only death could reunite them. He adds his father plans to offer one million dollars to the finder of the ""Talon Key"" as a publicity stunt for his newspaper. The key is believed to be somewhere on the grounds of the funeral home, the former Blood Prison, hence the film's title. They play with an Ouija board and Allie starts speaking Latin. Possession can cause that which is a sure-fire catalyst for the dead to rise. They do- three executioners ready to... what else, execute. Meanwhile, Phil, Cat and Jeff arrive to scare our game players. God knows this film could use a scare or two. It seems that Kristoff was caught exploring Phil's girlfriend's nether regions and he holds a grudge. Jeff is sent to fetch the truck and loses his head in the process. The dead are walking, slowly, but walking all the same. Rory and Michelle pair off to do some exploring of their own. The body count really starts here but nothing really memorable. It turns out the Kristoff and Phil are also partners in crime. Call it a plot twist. It left me uninspired. More people are possessed and/or die. The ""Talon key"" is found but by now you'll be echoing my sentiments. ""I paid for this?""",971222400,3,1725,4.603896103896104

7798566,2,157347228X,"No surprises. I confess that I do not know this genre very well but it seems pretty generic without much to make it stand out and make up for poor acting and predictable story and script. I did like the setting and the lighting. One reviewer says three guys were bi. Maybe, but maybe they were just ""modern"" youth -- and if that was the only unusual element in the film, then more could have been done with it to add a little more drama. So all in all I see this as a generic B college-age-students-and-somewhat-creepy monsters film in a cool setting.",1358899200,,551,4.359223300970874
7798567,1,157347228X,"I have never ordered a zombie movie from Amazon and then felt like I wanted my money back until this one. I am a huge zombie fan of novels and movies and any other medium that the genre is exploited in but I have to say this was the biggest disappointment in a zombie move ever. Those other people who gave this movie a good review must be the friends and family of the director or something, either that or we didn't watch the same movie. I mean is it me or were the only zombies we see in the movie the same clip shown over and over of some cloaked guy ""rising"" from the dead? I could go on ranting all day but suffice to say the movie stank and if you are a huge zombie movie fan like me... if you have a brain you will probably hate it.",1264550400,,740,3.9072847682119205

7798570,1,157347228X,"if you can get this movie for under $3.00 do it, otherwise leave it be. youd be better off to sit in front of your tv with it off for 80-something minutes.

not even really a zombie movie. there are i guess what you would call zombies, but they don't eat any one. everyone knows that zombies are hungry for flesh. it looks like the movie was made in about a week on one set. theres a tease of seeing some erotica, but then your let down hard.

unless your a stoner and can sit and watch bad movies, just for watching bad movies, steer clear of this one.",1105920000,2,553,4.064220183486238

7798572,1,157347228X,"Poorly done zombie flick that never scares up any scares, and has some preposterous gaps in credibility and editing.  Where in the world did the blood come from that brought the executioners back?  Why was the most despicable character in the movie the only one who survived?  What was this thing about Bill being hired to beat up Christoph?  Huh?....no one in the cast can be accused of acting; you may recognize Samuel Page from ""The Brotherhood"", but the rest of the cast is pretty unknown and will probably stay that way.
Directors should also realize by now that watching zombies move slow mo in their death walks is about as exciting as (one of the characters in this movie says:  An episode of Baywatch Nights).
Ho hum.",1080777600,2,726,4.640625
