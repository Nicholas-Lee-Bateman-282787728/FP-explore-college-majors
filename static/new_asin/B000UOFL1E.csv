8214135,5,B000UOFL1E,One of Mexico's fines films! A classic from way back!! Love this film.,1456099200,,70,4.461538461538462
8214136,3,B000UOFL1E,"In Mxico, ""Cabaret"" is a place, where people drink and dance. The show is known as ""vodevil"". That's why, when we see a movie with that name, we don't expect to see something like Liza Minelli's movie, but a place with naked drunk prostitutes.

This could be the counterpart of MUECAS DE MEDIANOCHE, because in the style of Victor Victoria, Sasha Montenegro impersonates a guy who is impersonating a woman.
But then Jorge Rivero enters the scene and falls (much to his dismay) in love WITH HER/HIM! And to make matters worse, is not only bad falling for another guy, this guy is a TRANSVESTITE! So Rivero prefers to commit suicide than being in love WITH A TRANSVESTITE...
Luckily, SHE/HE feels what's he is going through and decides to help, so she presents herself dressed as a man, confess her secret and not only saves his life, gets naked so he can breath relieved while grabbing her breasts and saying: THANK GOD YOU WERE NOT A GUY!! Then both jump to bed.

This movie could be everything you want, stupid, shallow, sexist, homophobic, have bad taste music or show ugly naked women with bad wigs and worse behinds... the attraction after all is Carmen Salinas, playing Cleopatra, doing what she started doing when she broke into show business, impersonations.
And she does Mara Victoria, Lola Beltrn, Irma Serrano and some more... good.",1316736000,2,1342,4.780172413793103
