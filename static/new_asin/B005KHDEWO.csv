4717790,4,B005KHDEWO,This is a very good educational dvd. The 3d Version has interesting special affects. This will suit all ages. Good job.,1323302400,,119,4.714285714285714
4717791,1,B005KHDEWO,"Totally disappointing!  Very little 3D appearance in this;  there are a very few nice visuals, but nothing that wouldn't look as effective in 2D.  Obviously written for much younger children(it might hold their interest), it makes you feel as if you're sitting in a third grade science class.  This should not even be an issue with this type of film, but there is some attempt at a storyline (you gotta have one to connect the scenes,or to present someone as a narrator). The ""acting"" is cringe-inducing......Ed Wood would not have hired these amateurs.  Way over-priced and boring.....my fault entirely for not reading further about this before purchasing.",1321920000,18,657,5.102803738317757
4717792,4,B005KHDEWO,Audio in spanish and english. 58 minutes longer. Good looking 3D effects. This is a movie that you have to buy for your collection. You will no have problem watching this in 3D. The effects look real and gave  me no headache..,1383004800,4,226,4.380952380952381
4717793,5,B005KHDEWO,I have all the imax 3d movies  but this is my favorite.  Educational and I think the 3d is very good.,1377734400,2,101,3.761904761904762
4717794,1,B005KHDEWO,I don't know how come this has an IMAX logo. I have seen almost all IMAX 3D's and this is rhe most boring one ever seen.,1365206400,,120,3.6538461538461537
4717795,5,B005KHDEWO,"Bought this as a gift for my husband after we saw the show in Victoria, Canada. I have to admit, it's a joke between us, and he was so surprised to know I found it here! We haven't watched it yet, but so glad Amazon has these more rare finds.",1361232000,,242,3.86
4717796,4,B005KHDEWO,Excellent 3d effect and visual quality. A must for all imax movie amateur.  narration is well done and very educative,1359244800,2,117,4.85
4717797,4,B005KHDEWO,"The movie and 3D effects are very nice with stunnig imagery of the sea reptiles and marine landscapes. I bought it for my 6 year old kid who was watching him over and over again. The information provided is interesting enough even for the adults and is presented simply, avoiding technicalities. All in all it is an worth buying product which you may watch several times with your friends or family.",1353801600,,399,4.633802816901408
4717798,5,B005KHDEWO,"Ok, I agree with the reviews which claim this was written for kids and not for adults, but not the views of the 3d picture. This is one of the BEST, you want to impress your friends with the purchase of a 3d tv, well this will do it, hands down. Right from the get-go, you have great depth, but it's the OOS shots that will blow your mind, atleast on my tv, there are atleast three shots that come out a good 50 to 70 percent ( around four feet ) toward the viewer. When you freeze frame these shots you'll get a ""wow"" out of everyone. Now I love dinosaurs and have been reading about them for years, so yes everything that's covered in this video is old news to me, but I bet most people don't know the history of dino fossils, so I'm sure the young people and many older will find this interesting, but , as I stated before it's the picture which wins all the rewards. These are great cgi graphics, very detailed and very sharp, much better then most of the other IMAXs or the 3d SEA MONSTERs by National Geographic.",1344211200,3,1018,4.146464646464646
4717799,5,B005KHDEWO,"I like 3D movies and I like documentaries. If you like them as well, then I highly recommend this DVD and know that you will not be disappointed. Amazon.com is a wonderful way to expand your 3D DVD collection. I am always impressed with the speed and accuracy of my purchases through Amazon. Try it yourself - you'll love the experience.",1329696000,2,337,4.540983606557377
4717800,1,B005KHDEWO,"I think the producers tried to make it educational,i'll give them that,but I thought it was boring and actually had a hard time staying awake. Had a store credit at a known dvd store in Hollywood so I luckily got it at a cheap price or I would've been even more disapointed. I thought the 3d was weak,the animals to passive and non threatning for a title like SEA REX.It was ok,but could've and should've been a lot better.",1323475200,3,423,4.367088607594937
4717801,3,B005KHDEWO,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 18 made it to 15%, 10 more at 25% and 2 extended to 30%.

The 3D of the computer generated animations are fairly consistent from scene to scene. I was pleasantly surprised that unlike most `originally ... IMAX' films, the 3D in this movie is NOT riddled with spurts of excessive parallax. However I did experience slight eye fatigue from this title. Not great 3D, not bad 3D.

***  3  star  ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

8476812,2,B005KHDEWO,"This movie could have been good but wasn't. Seemed to be thrown together and jumped on the ""3D bandwagon"" for profit.  I really like 3D and am lenient in rating and I will be selling this one.  Don't bother",1436400000,3,206,4.256410256410256

8476817,1,B005KHDEWO,Worst quality video I have ever purchased! The disk was dirty right out of the sealed package & wouldn't play. I carefully cleaned it but it still skipped & stalled so badly that we couldn't watch it for our planned family movie time. So disappointing. We checked Bluray player to make sure there was no problem with the equipment & it played beautifully. i can't speak t the content of this video because we were only able to see 3-4 minutes. Back it goes!,1396137600,2,457,4.4523809523809526
8476818,5,B005KHDEWO,"There are two things I really liked about this documentary. One is the outstanding 3D effects; I don't know what's wrong with other people's equipments, but it is really alive and eye-popping...gee, there is a pterosaur flying in your living room and an elasmosaur reaching into you!! There is a great sense of depth. The other thing is, while being highly educational, it does not have a single mistake concerning evolutionary interpretations, unlike most other documentaries out there. It may seem boring to some people simply because it intends that one learns something from it...so, keep away if you really don't want to learn.",1388016000,2,632,5.086538461538462
