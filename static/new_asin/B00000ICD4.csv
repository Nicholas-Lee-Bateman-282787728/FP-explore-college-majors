7910072,4,B00000ICD4,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others. In this volume Tenchi goes home to celebrate the anniversary of when he met the girls. Sakuya shows up and Ryoko causes trouble. Things get out of hand and Tenchi hits Ryoko. As you can imagine everything gets really dramatic. The 10th episode is also pretty good. Ryoko goes to Tokyo to go on a date with Tenchi. It ends up being a pretty wild fun fest, but has a very sweet ending. This DVD set is one of my favorites. It has a bit more drama than the others, and tugs at your heart strings.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1234,4.388646288209607
7910073,3,B00000ICD4,As a whole this series is not as good as Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe but is still good. Episode 10: Ryoko's Big Date is one exception. I would get this disk just for it. The series as a whole is not up to par with the rest of the other series but Ep 10 is possibly one of my favorites of all the series so I would get this just for that episode.,1176076800,,348,3.7162162162162162
7910074,4,B00000ICD4,"The first episode is just Part Two of the last episode of the last DVD.  While the girls and Tenchi's family are celebrating the two year anniversary of them coming together Sakuya pops up.  She decided to follow Tenchi home.  And when the crystal pendants that the Tenchi family made from the crystals left by Tenchi's mother disappears they all blame HER.  Who IS the real thief?
In the next episode we meet the Guardians of Old and learn a tad more about Yugi's past.  It might even make you feel a tad sorry for the girl.
The last episode is a date between Ryoko and Tenchi, which was both funny and touching.  Ryoko comes back from the date full of trust for Tenchi and even a tad less violent towards others.  She even seems to treat Ayeka a tad nicer.
Is Yugi losing or are her plans, in fact, still going forward?
While giving this DVD only four points I really enjoyed ""Ryoko's Big Date"".",1087603200,,897,4.367469879518072
7910075,1,B00000ICD4,"I'm sorry if I offend any true Tenchi in Tokyo fans, but this series really let me down.  I loved the first two Tenchi series, and was really looking forward to seeing Tenchi in Tokyo- and then, I saw it.  Here's what I thought of the whole thing overall.
1.  Horrible, horrible animation, the once cute Sasami looks like some evil, underworld demon.
2.  I don't know why, but some of the monsters remind me of something off of Sailor Moon.  Even though I do love Sailor Moon, the monsters on that show really cheese me off.
3.  The girl's personalities are strange.  They seem somehow different than in the last two series.
4.  Tenchi isn't nice to the girls most of the time.  He tries to keep all of them as far away from himself as possible- even the ones who actually act human like.
5.  Ryo-oki is Sasami's pet, which is just weird to me.
6.  Sakuya-  I really don't like that character.  Out of all of the things that let me down in this series, Sakuya let me down the most.  All of the girls-  Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Washu,& Kiyone- at least have a little thing for Tenchi.  I thought, ""Hey, they've been together for a while, he might acutally fall in love with one of them this time!""  Guess what?  I was wrong.  I wouldn't have minded another series with the girls fighting over him, but alas, it's not that way.  He meets a girl with exorsist green eyes and hair that looks incredibly like dead rats and falls in love with her instantly.  Worse, she has a personality more annoying than Sasami, Ayeka, and Mihoshi combined.  I used to not like those characters until Sakuya was introduced.  But what's even worse than that-  Sakuya isn't even really alive.... oops.
Well, that's my opinion on Tenchi in Tokyo.  Once again, sorry if I insulted any Tenchi in Tokyo or Sakuya fans, yadda yadda yadda.  I would only recomend this series if you haven't seen the previous Tenchi series, or just really like the idea of an annoying, ugly character stealing Tenchi's heart rather than one of the beloved characters from the previous series.  But I still suggest that you should just leave this series alone and not waste some of your precious, precious living time you can use watching some other anime.  Bubi!",1021593600,2,2222,4.515075376884422
7910076,4,B00000ICD4,"Tenchi in Tokyo isn't that bad, just needs some improvements. The animation should have been high quality like the OAV and the TV series. Next, the plot line needs some readjustment. However, this makes a very entertaining and funny start.
The episodes include one where Ryoko has a big date with Tenchi. It doesn't produce really any sparks but it's interesting. Also, there's one where Sakuya goes to Tenchi's house and ruins an anniversary party. The results are slightly emotional. One thing, Sakuya's dubbed voice should have been better!!!!",1000857600,,546,5.146067415730337
