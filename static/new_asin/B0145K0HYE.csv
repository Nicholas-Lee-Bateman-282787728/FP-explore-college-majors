8729681,3,B0145K0HYE,"There appears to be two versions of this product.  I also did not get the one with the movies listed in the posting; and I'm not buying the position that it could only be posted as a single title (ie. it could be version A or B).  As far as content, it's about what one could expect for the money; most of them are only worth sitting through if you have to kill time.  I would not recommend this to a friend, but, as many have pointed out, it's not much money for 12 movies.  I would like to say the shipping was the fastest I've seen.",1508198400,,535,3.97196261682243
8729682,4,B0145K0HYE,"Not all the movies in this collection actually achieve the basic B-rating seen in good monster and sci-fi movies but several of them were actually good movies.  My favorites were Stephen Baldwin's film about an asteroid cracking the moon in half, the Lance Hendrick film, Anti-Body, and the movie about the genetically altered spiders released into New York City when an old Russian Space experiment left abandoned in orbit crashes into the subway system and starts reeking havoc on commuters and the workers for the subway transit authority.  Ice Twisters was also not too bad a picture, as were a couple of the others.  However, the rest of the films were not that great.  Still, this 12-movie pack is a great way for fans of films like this to save money.  I got all of these movies for under $10.00 + shipping.  If I had tried to by them separate, the cost would be outrageous.  Ice Twisters alone is going for about $30.00 bucks last time I checked.  Getting it with this collection was a much cheaper, and more responsible investment, even if I only enjoyed half the films.",1503792000,5,1079,4.671957671957672
8729683,5,B0145K0HYE,"Out of twelve movies I did not like 3, so I got 9 good B movies for a low price. This set contains some of the best B movies in Sci-Fi around. I would get one for myself, and give as many as you can as gifts, because the movies in this set are just that good.
