3867535,2,B0027HOBMM,"In the commentary the DoP (Broms) and the director admit they ""were struggling"" with everything in this movie - and man did it show. This struggle included obvious re-shoots (ever wonder what Clifton Collins looks like with a wig?) and plot points being convoluted into confusion, forgotten or just plain eliminated (have to watch the deleted scenes), bad editing, an inability of one of the actors not speaking English well and the list goes on.

The plot has been summed up repeatedly here, but in the end, I was so bummed with how everything happened in the entire film, I actually watched it a second time to listen to the commentary to find out what went wrong. I have listened to many a discussion by the leaders of various films, so without slandering any one person, they summarized this whole thing up with the word they themselves kept using - painful.

This film is being supported heavily by these ""youth"" that participate in this suspension phenomenon happening all over the world, so expect to see lots of glowing reviews. And should you have some morbid interest in this self mutilation you can hear the director discuss all kinds of details about how to succeed at this. Did not work for me, but the only interest in seeing this waste of film would be to hear some of the songs and watching Quaid have one of his worst outings - ever. The camera work was unique at times, the storytelling was mismanaged (explained by how the crew kept comparing things to how they made music videos) and the performances were below average.

3867537,2,B0027HOBMM,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Starts well, with the theme of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
2. If only I could say the same of the middle and ending.

Dennis Quaid plays a detective who totally neglects his two sons after the death of his wife.  He doesn't seem to be doing much better in solving a series of violent murders, with apparent links to the Four Horsemen - War, Famine, Pestilence and Death.

The majority of the characters are miscast - Quaid just looks tired and out of his league, while Ziyi Zhang uncharacteristically fails to be anything short of annoying.

By the middle of the movie it's fairly obvious what's going to happen, but then at the end it just stops, leaving you hanging with a puzzled expression on your face, and a strong feeling of loss for your last 90 minutes.

This is a movie that should have been put out of its misery with a coup de grace in the cutting room.

""Who done it"" was quite obvious after a little while.  The movie is an ongoing torture (of the viewers' intelligence) with holes in the plot you could drive a Mac truck through and ghastly over acting by one of the stars.  As a vehicle for Dennis Quaid, a chance for him to show off emotionalism, it had some success, but no-one who was so intelligent in some respects, as his character was, would be so astoundingly stupid in other respects, and I cannot imagine that anyone as badly damaged as his character was would have been allowed to continue in such a responsible position.

This film is kind of a throwback -- pacing, scene cuts, settings ... I was surprised looking back that it was produced in 2009 (screams late 90s).  It's derivative of a number of movies that followed on ""Silence of the Lambs"" through the 1990s and cop dramas of the same period too.  It's not as fast paced as you'd expect, and it verges on cliche sometimes, but it's the kind of movie you can get lost in albeit that it doesn't make the hair on the back of your neck stand straight up.",1516492800,,682,4.346456692913386

3867569,4,B0027HOBMM,"Horsemen isn't nearly as bad as the reviews say, but with that in mind, it's not the most interesting murder/mystery out there either.  Dennis Quaid is a really good actor- always playing serious roles compared to his brother Randy which strikes me as strange.

Anyway Horsemen is about Dennis portraying a detective trying to figure out the clues pertaining to a horsemen Biblical prophecy.  Those prophecies are as follows- War, Famine, Conquest and Death.  Another surprisingly frequent element to the story is that Dennis is distant from his two songs after the death of his wife, and whenever he tries to make plans to be with them such as going to hockey games or restaurants, he gets a sudden phone call and has to rush to yet another murder scene which upsets his sons a lot and further distances himself from a typical father/son relationship.

I really enjoy the character of Zhang Ziyi.  She pretends to be innocent and charming only to suddenly hold up a bag of bloody guts while hugging Dennis in one segment which is the best moment of the movie, not to mention the most surprising and scariest.  Seriously the way this whole scene plays out is CRAZY!  Talk about questioning reality in a huge way, haha.  Zhang turns out to be connected to these Horsemen murders and constantly acts demonic (and sexy!) and latches onto Dennis whenever she can in the investigation rooms.  I notice Dennis wasn't exactly quick to turn away either- yeah you know Zhang's cute don't you Dennis?  You know it!

Anyway four people die in different ways.  Perhaps mentioning how each person dies is a spoiler, so warning- SPOILERS!  One person has his teeth removed and put on display (a serving tray) in the middle of a frozen lake.  Another victim is hanging in her bedroom and drowns in her own blood.  To add insult in injury, she was pregnant and someone removed the fetus.  Unfortunately the final two murders happen so nonchalantly and messily that I honestly can't explain what happened to them because I just don't know.  One happens in a tattoo parlor but some of the events immediately after aren't really clear to me.

From here the story gets really messy and confusing, so I'm not quite sure what's going on.  There's a scene showing two brothers having a discussion in a restaurant.  The one brother prefers men which the other brother takes exception to.  I must have missed this next crucial part because it happens quickly, but the man-preferring brother (amazon won't let me use the g word sorry, so I'll just call him by his name in the movie, Cory!) put a sedative in his brother's drink which explains why I got confused in the next scene showing the drugged and dazed brother stumbling around in the parking lot.

In a somewhat crazy twist, a thief approaches Cory while he's busy dealing with his drugged brother but is quickly stabbed.  In the next scene Cory has his brother stuck in a device with hooks all through his skin, and he's hanging in the air with his eyes forced open.  How sick!  Turns out Cory's incredibly ticked that his brother doesn't support his ways despite how much Cory used to look up to his brother.  Really crazy how this scene just happens out of nowhere.  Even crazier is (SPOILERS) that the brother actually survives this.

The ending's pretty good.  Without spoiling, all the detective work Dennis has done up to this point finds himself in a situation comparable to an above incident with his son trapped in a similar fashion as Cory's brother.  Really good writing throughout the movie for the most part, but it's just confusing how some of these events seemingly come out of nowhere.  Once Dennis puts the clues together and realizes every murder is connected to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, things get out of control for everybody.

This movie's surprisingly decent, even if confusing and sloppily written at times.  Dennis plays a detective well (reminding me of Thomas Gibson of Criminal Minds) and Zhang Ziyi is just absolutely *crazy!* but I mean that in a good way because she's memorable.  Solid acting all around, pretty strong atmosphere and worth recommending.  Just expect some events to occur without much of a build-up at times which might confuse you.",1464912000,,4224,4.7699724517906334

The take on the serial killer genre is done well here, so don't let all the naysayers turn you away. At no point does the film delve too deeply into anything, and thats the main failing of the story.

It has a pretty original plot, the acting is better than most of the horror movies out there, the music is solid and the cinematography is great. The bleak, winter landscapes and haunting minimalistic scores are really nice honestly and part of why I love this movie.

The first time I watched it I was a bit confused but the more you watch it the more you catch and each time I find something new to like about it. It isn't 5 star quality because it really should have been longer and it should have explained things more thoroughly and it could have used some better actors on screen. As I said before it wasn't as bad as most but there's time it could have been a lot better. I wish they would have given Ziyi Zhang more screen time because she was just delightfully creepy in every scene.

I really do enjoy this film with all its flaws. I have no idea how someone can watch this and call it a horrible movie unless they really just couldn't stomach some of the torture scenes.

The cast is fairly strong and acting is well done. I went into the film expecting a poorly shot low budget affair with a hack-job story and found a film that could have been very good if it hadn't gotten in its own way.

The issues occur in the story. A few times during the film it feels like things are missing. Like vital plot points were left out. However, the nail in the film's coffin is its predictability. Key antagonists are seen a mile away. Clues in the dialogue that allude to the persons of interest would be picked up by even the most amateur of film viewer. Ultimately, a film that could have been a 4 or 5 star affair is lost on less than clever ""plot twists"" and gaps in the narrative.

  All and all a pretty good setup and you get a good feel for the cop, his kids, the job.

  The movie becomes darker and move twisted as the investigation continues.

If you like dark suspense films and the Cop investigation drama then this is a great film for you!  I really enjoyed it.  Som will say there were a couple of places that didn't make sense... but they do.  A few of the clues like in real life are out there... and coming from a mind of a killer... that is kinda to be expected.

The message ""come and see"" is also painted on 4 different trees. It's not long before another body is found. Eventually they discover the killers are using the Biblical four horsemen of the apocalypse as the context for their murders. There are several twists at this point in the movie, one of which was a little shocking to me and another which didn't make a lot of sense. Quaid's detective finally figures out the killers' end game setting up the climax.

Dennis Quaid's performance is the best thing about Horsemen. The plot has a nice set up, but in the middle some things happen that don't make much sense and there's a potential plot point that is never mentioned again. There are also clues and lines of investigation that get mentioned once and never followed after that. The biggest problem was when they get to the full explanation of what's behind the murders, well, its stupid.

He opens the tray and... we cut to the next scene which includes a Dennis Quaid's naked butt taking a shower. It is like someone has read a book on how to make a horror film, but has never actually seen one. But then you realize this is not a horror movie at all. They never show the graphic torture or killing, just mostly naked mutilated corpses.

After 2 killings, Quaid figures out it is ritualistic and related to the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. Using forensics he makes deductions about the 4 killers and attempts to prevent 2 more murders. The movie includes Quaid's depressing home life as he alienates his two sons with his work. As the movie appears to hit its low point, Quaid gets quite an unexpected lead...from one of the killers!

  Minor spoiler *******Sometimes someone knows when someone in a film is going to take more than a minor role merely by the fact that you have seen that actor in many other or some very prominent roles before and that is the case is with Ziyi Zhang's character. Although Ziyi Zhang is a fine actress, her role may have been better played by someone else (maybe) in part because even though her character was adopted at the age of eight she still has a heavy accent but more than that I guess the role she could have played (or should I say the script could have been much better)****

More than likely you will be glad you didn't spend two hours or more on this disappointing movie. The premise of the movie, i.e. the four horsemen of the apocalypse being used as a motivation for murder, was intriguing, but ultimately it was frustrating and disappointing because the storyline was too incoherent. There was just too much of this movie that didn't make sense, and you're kind of left scratching your head. I agree with other reviewers about the graphic violence, too... it was very, very disturbing, with many scenes involving bodies suspended by large rigs using fish hooks. So this movie is not for the squeamish and certainly should not be seen by young children. Perhaps many or most modern viewers have become accustomed to seeing such graphic bloody images and it doesn't faze them. But if so, is that a good thing? It's very sad in my opinion.

The best part of the movie was the storyline involving Dennis Quaid as the emotionally distant father and the way he and his kids deal with the loss of their wife/mother.

  The movie is essentially about kiilings that have to do with bible prophecy and the 4 horsemen of the apolcalypse, war, famine, pestlience and death.  The murders are perpetrated in gruesome ways using the subculture of body mutilation as its back drop.  The premise of the movie is that the horsemen is telling the world thaat they are tired of having parents that have little to nothing to do for them or with them, and they are raising the veil to show the world what is going to be taking place, essentially mass murder across the world by children against thier parents or parent figures.  The ending is really a twist that you might not be expecting, and that may turn many people away...however i did not find it that bad and definately not worth all the 1 and 2 star reviews.

3867612,2,B0027HOBMM,"Maybe the real question should be ""DO YOU CARE if Aidan Breslin can stop the apocalyptic serial killers?""  By the end of ""Horesmen"", the answer for me was no.

I'm usually a fan of Dennis Quaid, but I kinda wish he would have skipped this role.  Similar to movies like ""Se7en"", the killers in ""Horsemen"" use the bible as a motive for their diabolical actions.  However, unlike ""Se7en"", this movie's plot isn't very coherent, the sets aren't believable and the characters don't seem to mesh as well.  Plus, come on guys (Dennis Quaid and Clifton Collins, Jr), what's up with the hair?  This is the new millenium, not the 1970's.  Get a cut, would ya?

Additionally, Ziyi Zhang's character isn't very believable.  Hannibal Lecter she ain't.  I don't necessarily think it's bad acting, just a bad script.  If you want to see Ms Zhang in a (much) better role, check out ""The Road Home""--unlike ""Horsemen"", it's a 5-star movie that you CAN'T buy used for a penny from over 100 different sellers; a lot simpler, but a lot better.

3867613,2,B0027HOBMM,"What ""Horsemen"" has going for it is a cast with some very capable actors (Dennis Quaid, Patrick Fugit, Lou Taylor Pucci) and a director (Jonas Ackerlund) who has made some of the most kickass music videos of all time, and, as far as I know, one trippy, strange film (""Spun""). Unfortunately, what ""Horsemen"" lacks is a decent script.

""Horsemen"" is a serial killer film, specifically one where the killer (or, in this case, killers) is trying to use murder as a soapbox. This has been done before, specifically in David Fincher's far, far superior film ""Seven"". In ""Horsemen"", the culprit is actually an organized group of disenfranchised youth, who have created their gang and its baroque performance art as a way to lash out against the parents and society who have wronged them.

Honestly, it's all really very silly and derivative. The film fails at being scary, creepy, or surprising (anyone can see the big ""twist"" coming from a mile away). And ultimately, the film really has little of interest to say about the consequences of abusing or neglecting children, other than that they might grow up to have an unhealthy interest in S&M, the internet, or biblical prophecy.",1283817600,,1174,4.894472361809045

He is one of those actors who does not immediately come to mind for most people, yet he has had a very busy career with many good movies.

Horsemen is NOT one of them.

This film feels like an editing chop job where the weakness and predictability of the story is trying to be disguised by the bizarre and macabre.

Also the Asian girl who constantly teases and plays with Dennis Quad is supposed to be creepy and haunting.  Instead she is simply annoying and irritating.
Everytime she was on the screen toying with Dennis Quad and refusing to answer questions, I was thinking to myself - Call Jack Bauer from 24 and let him spend a few hours with her. She will tell you what you need to know.

I don't know much about the background of this movie but something tells me they ran into problems making it or had their budget cut short and had to jam it together at the last minute.

Whatever happened, the potential of the movie was lost.

Over the top visual violence was used to make up for weak story and unfortunately you could see the ""twist"" coming only 30 minutes into the film.

Basically a train wreck of a film.

3867618,5,B0027HOBMM,"I'm into biblical scary/creepy movies and I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10.  From reading other reviews, I notice that a few plot holes are the main theme of why the movie isn't so great.  But I'm here to help explain them.  Being one that I tend to understand movies like this, the ideaology of the movie is that, within each person who were the horsemen- they felt inside.

Kristin who was war; was at war with herself, inside because here she is a beautiful young girl and her adopted father molested and probably raped her.  So, all the while thinks, okay... I was adopted and love by this family up to a certain point and then ripped apart.  I'm the same way, I've experienced this myself, it's why I know- because I'm at war with myself too at time.

Then there was Garrison Jacobs; who was Pestilence, we find out from Kristin in her jail cell that Garrison was heartbroken and a liar and that he claimed the teacher molested his son, when it wasn't true.  But you know what, that's what Pestilence is, spreading diseased excuses or lies because technically- pestilence means plague.  But because of who and what he was, it killed him from his own.

As for Corey Kuth, he was dead inside because of his brother not accepting him for who he was.  It literally destroyed what he believed in and made his dead from the world.  Therefore, he was death and as he put it when he stabbed the man who tried to rob him, ""Hell follows me"" and in a way, he was the cause of that by letting it get to him so badly.  So he put an end to it by killing himself in front of his brother- to make his brother see that hell follows with his death.

Then there is Alex Breslin, who is conquest, he's the conquering hero, the white horse, the leader of the pact.  He found these three people from his group therapy and put together a website called, ""We are the Nothing"" because to them, they feel like they are ""nothing"" and that no one understands them.  That's the plot line of the movie, no one understands them and they punish those who wronged them and video tape it so that when Alex sacrifices himself as the fourth victim, the apocolypse will happen.  The veil will be lifted, their videos will be shown and everyone will realize that these four kids were capable of killing others because those others knew how basically kill these kids inside.  The loss of Alex's mother and then his father not being apart of his life, what do parents expect?  They're kids to be happy and well-grounded, kids feel and this is why they did what they did.  They hurt and they hurt the people who hurt them.  That's all!

Dennis Quaid on the other hand, I couldn't believe his character as Aiden Breslin didn't even step into his older sons room and check on him more.  I know his career is a driving force in the movie because he's a detective but there are moments in everyone's lives where their kids are more important than work, especially when there's been a death in the family.

Good movie, I've watched it five times in two days, trying to understand it and by the 5th time, I finally understood it, even without the plot being a 100% up to par.

3867619,3,B0027HOBMM,"We have another fantastical series of murders here. This time, victims are suspended from hooks and left to ""bleed out"" as they hang, enmeshed in their rigging. These murders are linked to the destructive onslaught of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. There are a couple of things wrong with this invocation of the Book of Revelation.

First, the suspense/murder mystery genre is really showing the strain with this new entry in the field. It underscores how we are entering a sort of era of Roman decline in which ever more shocking, grisly horrors must be presented in order to keep us entertained and register any sensation at all. A tidy, tuxedoed body in the library won't do any more. As the creators of the CSI series and films such as this seem to think - murders must now be graphic, gruesome, and elaborately taunting and inventive if they are to have any hope of capturing our attention. However this escalation has lead to film murders that no human murderer could hope to accomplish - such as here and in last year's movie ""Anamorph."" Such films, congratulating themselves on their brutal realism, actually start as impossible absurdities.

To be fair though, Jonas Akerlund, the Director of ""Horsemen,"" does point out in the Director's Commentary that there is a fairly large and growing subculture of people who practice hook ""suspension"" for the altered state of consciousness such painful dangling brings. He says he explored this subculture in the process of doing research for the movie, but stopped just short of trying the procedure himself. So there is some fact behind the fiction of these murders.

The other problem with the film's premise though is that the Four Horsemen aren't really necessary to explain means or motive. The Biblical reference is just a muddying overlay. It seems a last ditch effort to ramp up the shock value. Akerlund, again in the bonus Commentary, said that some of the Asian editions of the DVD had jackets showing the lead actors on horseback. The Asian cover designers had apparently taken the title ""Horsemen"" literally rather than as a Biblical allusion. But actually, the actors might just as well have been on horseback. A Wild West backdrop for the crimes would have been just as relevant (or irrelevant) as the Biblical one lowered here.

However, behind all the gory bizarre, this movie makes some interesting points, and includes some arresting performances. Lou Taylor Pucci is very good as the detective's son, and Ziyi Zhang does a fascinating turn as the eldest daughter of the first victim. Overall, this movie will probably leave you with something to think about.",1262822400,2,2635,4.941309255079007
3867620,2,B0027HOBMM,"This movie was trying to be two movies, 'Se7en' and 'The Flock'.  Both movies deal with murders done by people of less-than-moral standings.  'Horsemen' takes the religious murders from 'Se7en' and the antagonists from a more ill-understood parts of society (such as the body-mod community) that was seen in 'The Flock' and tries to squish them together.

As you can probably read in the synopsis the main protagonist, Dennis Quad, is a police officer that gets a call about a series of grisly murders that seem to follow a pattern.  Also throughout the movie is a sorta sub-plot about his lack-luster parenting skills as he tries to connect with his sons since their mother's death.

The basic plot isn't anything we haven't seen before.  The presentation however is something else.  The murders are portrayed in a very graphic horror/torture way, with bodies being hung and drained of blood sometimes.  I thought that the balance of the whole thing was slightly off.  The story with Aidan (or really Dennis Quad cause I couldn't really distinguish him as an actor from his character) and his kids doesn't really do the job of adding a 'middle-man innocence'.  'The Flock' and 'Se7en' both had characters and scenes that were completely removed from the main plot, which added a sense of normalcy that is absent in 'Horsemen'.

My biggest gripe with the movie is that element seen from 'The Flock', where the antagonists come from a little-understood part of society.  Tattoo shops and body-suspension were put in a very very poor light.  The actual act of voluntary suspension is not about torture but a form of mediation.  I wouldn't expect the general public to understand it (actually had an argument with my dad about trying to explain how suspension and other activities from the body-mod community aren't 'just about mutilation'), but a little knowledge and open-mindedness can stop people from assuming every tattoo wearer is out to slice their throat.  However when people from these communities are used as the fall-back villain than how can the general public display any acceptance of their practices?

Anyway to finish the review: there is nothing spectacular about 'Horsemen'.  The horror comes out too gritty and too intense from the beginning with nothing to really balance it and kinda dies out towards the end which can be seen from a mile away.  I only sorta enjoyed it (I really liked Ziyi Zhang's character a lot), but it was just way too close to 'Se7en' and 'The Flock' to have any really shining qualities.  If you can look past all that, the actually pacing of the storyline isn't that bad, it's just isn't original.",1261958400,,2642,4.90990990990991

Also not believable was Zhang Ziyi's role. But it was a pretty good acting job by Dennis Quaid, and altogether not that bad, just could have been a lot better.

I should add, there is one moment that is absolutely chilling and had me on the edge of my seat, and that doesn't happen too often. This might work better if called a horror flick instead of a cop movie, which was I think what the cover copy said. Different expectations.

3867623,1,B0027HOBMM,"Sometimes the production history behind a film is more interesting than the film itself (like, say, ""Town and Country""). Even if you don't know ""Horsemen,"" directed by Jonas kerlund, (""Spun"") went through re-shoots and re-edits, you will know something is wrong with the thriller that has only 90 minutes. Several parts are never explained (and not in the way that will make the film intriguing). The film opens promisingly, but soon loses its way and the wrap-up is terribly rushed. In short, the story of ""Horsemen"" doesn't make much sense.

Dennis Quaid plays a Detroit police detective Aidan Breslin, whose beloved wife died recently. The hardened detective has to investigate a string of grisly ritualistic serial murders, and he discovers Kristin (Ziyi Zhang), a beautiful daughter of one victim, knows the truths behind the cases.

The film's effective photography captures the cold, chilling atmosphere that perfectly matches the story, and Ziyi Zhang's rather campy acting is kind of attractive, but the storyline remains weak and unfocused throughout, not strong enough to attract the viewers. Cryptic messages left at the crime scenes are not really interesting, neither are the film's biblical references. Dennis Quaid's police detective actually has little to do while investigating. Reliable and talented actors like Clifton Collins Jr. are wasted, or just forgotten.

There are some moments in ""Horsemen,"" where the incredible story shows a sign of improvement as a thriller or a drama. That never happens, however. At the end of the film, you will be left wondering ""Did I miss something?"" Sadly, no, you didn't.",1258070400,,1628,5.277992277992278

3867626,3,B0027HOBMM,"I mildly watchable, mildly grotesque whodunnit so full of clich&eacute;s that vital twists are predictable. I watched it intently, however, for 3 reasons: Zhang Ziyi (in an English language role), Dennis Quaid and the visuals by two Swedes, Jonas kerlund (director) and Eric Broms (DP). If it weren't for them, this film would have gotten 2 stars from me.

Dennis has gotten beefier and more eccentric -- and also more effortlessly magnetic. He was in every scene as the relentless detective with family issues -- and, as an actor, he never flagged. So it was quite an accomplishment for Zhang Ziyi, in a much smaller role, to share a few scenes with him and still be memorable.

The rewriting to accommodate her casting was sloppy (primarily, she's too old for the role as written). But that was the fault of the writers. She did wonders with what was given her. And she's sexier in this role than in any other role I've seen her in -- and she spends most of her time heavily covered up.

Ultimately, a disappointing story -- but much of the journey kept promising something better. And, unlike most Hollywood films today, this was a visually pleasing movie (except for the gore, that is).",1256428800,,1190,4.711538461538462
3867627,2,B0027HOBMM,"I picked this up because it looked interesting, Dennis Quaid is a really good actor, and Zhang Ziyi was in it.  The movie seemed pretty interesting and enjoyable for the first half, even though it was obviously something of a ""Se7en"" copycat.  I was surprised by the turn involving Zhang Ziyi's character, which was good, since a suspense movie is usually improved when the story has some surprises in store for you.  Alas, from that turn, the movie started to go downhill.  It was painfully predictable from that point on.  (Read no further if don't want spoilers.)  I knew just as soon as they set Detective Breslin's (Dennis Quaid's) oldest son Alex up as a very bright, but unmotivated student, and made a point (over and over again) of the fact that Breslin's work keeps him from spending much time with his boys, that the oldest kid was going to be the ringleader of the four murderers who call themselves ""The Four Horsemen.""  At the end, we're obviously supposed to be torn up at the heart-wrenching conclusion, when Breslin discover's what his son has done, and his son suicides in front of him to confront him with his failure as a father.  I had almost the opposite reaction.  My first thought was ""have we really become so self-indulgent as culture, that we are supposed to feel sympathy with someone who commits multiple, horrific torture-murders because his daddy didn't pay him enough attention?!?  Are you kidding me!?""

Another problem is that this whole thing just doesn't feel true.  Breslin's son really isn't all that believable as a serial killer, given his character background.  Perhaps it's just because, thanks to my work, I know too much about them and their usual characteristics.  John Doe, in ""Se7en"" was a believable serial killer, because he was given several characteristics of a psychopath -- which almost all serial killers are, and which is defined as someone who lacks empathy and guilt, who is egocentric and impulsive, who can often convincingly fake the human emotions he lacks, and who does not conform to social norms, conventional morality and society's laws.  John Doe was also a classic ""mission-oriented"" serial killer (as opposed to a lust killer whose crimes sexually gratify him; a hedonistic serial killer, who derives pleasure from killing; or a ""visionary"" serial killer, who suffers psychotic breaks with reality, and acts out of his delusions).  Breslin's son is obviously meant to be a mission oriented serial killer like John Doe was, but again, his history doesn't fit, and his obvious care for his younger brother isn't consistent with a real serial killer's psychopathic personality.  Also, almost all serial killers underwent some form of actual abuse, whether physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional as a children, which doesn't apply to Alex either.  In fact, nothing in this kid's past is really characteristic of a serial killer.  The only character in the film who does have typical serial killer factors in her past is Zhang Ziyi's, but her behavior is more characteristic of male serial killers than the female ones (who almost always have a different MO).

Anyway, this is a movie that started out well, but once it became clear where they were going with it, it quickly lost steam and became just another mediocre copycat picture.",1255564800,,3304,4.983606557377049

The resulting single-father status and responsibility of two growing boys and weight of the loss of his wife seems too much for him to take.  His attention to work helps him discover the truth (wow, who would think that would happen in a movie [sarcasm and so predictable]) but not really in time and his character never really seems to develop (although he tells his son things are going to be different).

3867639,1,B0027HOBMM,"The Horsemen (Jonas kerlund, 2009)

I saw an ad online for this movie a couple of days ago, as it had just come out on DVD, and I marveled that I'd never heard of this before. How could I have missed a mystery/horror flick starring two very big names (Dennis Quaid and Ziyi Zhang) and directed by a respected guy like kerlund? I've never been a big kerlund fan, but I know he's gotten a lot of critical respect for Spun, a drug comedy/action flick he made a few years back. And yet this, produced by Michael Bay no less, as far as I can tell went to a few festivals, played for a couple of weeks in five American cities, and then got dumped straight to DVD. What? And the premise was pretty darned cool, a kind of Seven ripoff based on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rather than the seven deadly sins. I'm all for Seven ripoffs if they're quality, so I knew I had to go rent a copy and check it out. And now I understand completely why it achieved instant obscurity. The Horsemen is, of the 25-30 I've seen so far, the worst movie of 2009.

Quaid plays Aidan Breslin, a detective with a background in orthodontics who gets assigned to a case after a cache of extracted, bloody teeth is found in the woods. The first body is found soon after, the wife of a prominent businessman (Peter Stormare) who has a number of adopted children. One of those, Kirsten (Zhang), has just turned eighteen and seems attracted to the recently-widowed Breslin. He, however, has his own problems dealing with both the death of his wife and the resentment of his older son (Southland Tales' Lou Taylor Pucci). Breslin is convinced that the murderers (for there must be four) have taken the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their motif, and the case becomes a race against time--can they find the killers before they find themselves with more victims? Things get weird when one of the murders chooses to step into the light--and it's the last person Breslin would have suspected...

There was a great deal of potential here, but every time it reared its ugly head, it was soundly beaten down either by the pedestrian direction, the woeful miscasting (Ziyi Zhang's performance has been talked to death, no reason for me to do more than mention it here), or the script, which managed to get the big plot twists right, but lacks everything else. Breslin's actions are in many ways affected by the death of his wife, but other than being pulled out for a row with the kid and mentioned in order to set it up, we don't get any real sense of the thing. For that matter, we don't get much of that about anyone; we get told about the affectations of certain characters, but we never get a sense of those as actual pieces of their personalities. They're nothing but plot points.

3867642,2,B0027HOBMM,"The premise of the movie was intriguing, which is why I rented it in the first place. The idea of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse being brought back to ""life"" by some sadistic killers, held some appeal as I wanted to see how this premise was going to play out. The result was utterly disappointing, and what really annoyed me was the last 10-15 minutes of the movie which just seemed altogether preachy and predictable.

The movie centers around a police detective who is also a specialist, a forensic odontologist [did i get that right?], Aidan Breslin, played by Dennis Quaid. He is a widower who is so overcome by grief over the loss of his wife, that he neglects his two sons, the older one Alex played by Lou Taylor Pucci. He gets embroiled in a series of murder investigations, accompanied by his partner Stingray [Clifton Collins Jr, in a totally insignificant role] which has the victims strung up in suspension devices [their limbs supported or rather suspended from said device with large fish hooks], and with the cryptic words ""Come and See"" written on the walls, on the trees etc. One such case, where a suburban mother is killed, has Breslin coming into contact with the victim's adopted Asian daughter, Kristen [Chinese import Zhang Ziyi of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""] who smiles in a sinister fashion at the initially clueless Breslin.

As time goes by, Breslin figures out that the phrase ""Come and See"" is in the Book of Revelation, and references the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, i.e. Conquest, War, Famine, and Death. Intriguing premise right? Unfortunately, this interesting plot premise never gets fully explained. The plot takes strange twists and turns, sinking viewers into a quicksand of incoherency and abominable acting - especially by Zhang Ziyi, who never convinces for one moment that she is actually capable of the things she claims to have done, in fact her acting is atrocious, not only because of her poor command of the English language and the resulting inappropriate enunciations and facial expressions, but also her whole demeanor is just plain annoying. Dennis Quaid's performance is average, and I couldn't help but wonder why he took this role. The supporting cast is also quite ho-hum, and there was not one single stand out performance to salvage this mess of a movie. I'd rather watch reruns of the series ""Milennium"".

3867644,2,B0027HOBMM,"I have a definite fondness for psychological thrillers; they have the terrific potential to engage its audience, to serve up suspense and send the audience into one mind-boggling ride. In the tradition of ""Seven"" and ""Resurrection"", ""HORSEMEN"" is another suspense thriller that captures themes of religious and Biblical significance that mixes in some mild elements from ""Saw"" and ""Antibodies"". Directed by Jonas Akerlund and co-produced by Michael Bay, the film is a composition of a very grim narrative that gets its strength from probable misery.

Aidan Breslin (Dennis Quaid) is a cop reeling from the death of his wife some years ago; trying to keep everything together with his two sons, Sean and Alex (Liam James and Lou Taylor Pucci respectively). Life isn't already easy for a single dad who happens to be assigned to a new serial killer case that targets the city with the promise of Biblical apocalypse. When a demented killer gives herself up, (played by Ziyi Zhang) a young woman  named Kristin who is supposedly a victim of sexual abuse. She apparently holds the codes to further acts of murder that somehow involves the fetish action of suspension. Aidan relentlessly works to make sense of the clues, as Kristin is not the only psychopath on the loose, but three others who have the ambition to name themselves after the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.

The film has tremendous potential and the direction definitely knows that it does have an ambitious theme. Akerlund does manage to engage me in the film's first 40 minutes as it generates an eerie atmosphere, some freaky images and a feeling of dread that captures a strong sensation of despair that something bad is going to happen and that it is only going to get worse. The script combines certain CSI-like aesthetics and good cinematography that manipulates the senses to expect something truly shocking and unnerving. The film's promise is there, and quite frankly it left me anticipating what would come next. After all, a prophetic killer holds such a large promise that it may at least be twisted as ""Resurrection"".

Well, after we become privy to a dead fetus, the film goes downhill. The film just loses its momentum, it started to lack any feeling of suspense and doesn't even give a decent scare. The plot becomes a bit convoluted as the film's central plot slowly begins to unveil. The Biblical theme begins to get lost in its narrative, that the ambition becomes a muddled and quite frankly too predictable. Instead we begin to see a father-son relationship take center stage, and whatever creepiness it may have attained become muddied by too much teenage angst. Alright, I can forgive a bit of a subtle subplot here and there, as long as it helps its theme come full circle, which becomes the main issue with the script--it stops short.

The writing does seem to be in the right spot, but writer David Callaham takes the biblical tone to acts of sadism, that creeps around to pack some gross-out spots to attain some shock value. The killings are intense, the self-mutilation scenes can be a bit gory (thank goodness there's no CGI) but it does nothing to advance its biblical tone. Unlike ""Seven"" the way the gore and blood are set up doesn't fit its religious overtone that it becomes very insignificant. After awhile, it all becomes like a cheap way to surprise its audience; the writing felt a little confused, and it loses focus on everything else. The film also tries to generate a similar ""Clarice and Lecter"" feel to the Aidan and Kristin relationship but it never becomes compelling. ""Horsemen"" reaches a cinematic digression that it never recovers from, as the script becomes more and more unfocused.

The acting is decent for the most part. Quaid had his moments, and I do know that the man can act. Well, I guess he did nicely in his portrayal as a cop-father who is trying to keep things together. Ziyi Zhang may be a little miscast but she made do with what she had. Zhang is one very charismatic lady and it was quite refreshing to see her broaden her horizons in acting. She is sexy, seductive, and maybe even a bit creepy in her portrayal as the adopted daughter who gets sexually abused. (Sorry, the sex scenes are only hinted at, but there is Polaroid shot of a possible sighting of a nude Ziyi Zhang)

I suppose ""Horsemen"" had the ambition to try to depart the usual serial killer mechanics but unfortunately, it misses its mark. Experienced movie fans will undoubtedly see the twist coming from a mile away. I do not want to spoil the film, but suffice it to say, the film blends elements from ""Seven"" and ""Resurrection"" with some ""Silence of the Lambs"" together with some ""Antibodies""-like twist and turns. It feels like parts of other successful psychological thrillers that make up its whole; with the message of an angry generation making up its focal point. The climax is just too underwhelming and quite ridiculous. While the heart may be in the right place, the film's execution is just a whole lot of uneven misfires.

After Tom Hanks, now Dennis Quaid demonstrates how awfully he can act if he wants to.
He is a forensic odontologist (did I get that right?), and this fact is almost entirely irrelevant for the story. He is an incredibly bad single father to his two sons, and it is very hard to believe that a father wouldn't have tried just a litte bit harder.
