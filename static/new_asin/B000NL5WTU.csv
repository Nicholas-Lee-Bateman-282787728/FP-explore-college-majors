2772221,5,B000NL5WTU,"I love this video. There is a video for everyone and for all strengths and levels.  I was doing Tae Bo before my third pregnancy but had purchased this after the birth of my 2nd child when I was 192 pounds AFTER delivery and had postnatal depression.  This is a very approachable nonintimidating workout.  It will make you sweat and it is all about control and focus.  Now after a slow recovery from the third child and having to have a re-episiotomy after the first one not working, I am so grateful! I can't do much as far as physical activity until I heal but I can walk (low impact).  I feel so empowered to be doing...something to help my weight and it is great for releasing stress...with my doctors approval.  This video is well made and I listen to my MP3 player while doing it because I already learned the moves and flow from having used it with my second child.",1291075200,5,872,4.351851851851852
2772222,5,B000NL5WTU,"I really love this walking workout.  The cueing is great, the pacing is good, and the movements are easy to follow.  I am not very well coordinated, and had no difficulty following the movements.  There is no annoying chit chat, and the workout made me sweat.  The workout, from start to finish (warm up to cool down) is about 50 minutes.  This is truly a good low-impact workout that I think anyone can do.",1219363200,5,407,4.445945945945946
2772223,4,B000NL5WTU,"I really like the woman who leads the workout, she doesn't seem like as much of a ding dong as a lot of girls on workout videos.  I like the routine becase it is easy to get the hang of, you don't need a lot of coordination and it is low impact (it doesn't bother my fibromyaligia at all), but I feel like I am pretty out of shape and this doesn't quite get my heart going as much as I would like.  I wish it was a little more challenging",1216944000,4,438,3.802197802197802
8179158,3,B000NL5WTU,"Its ok. But its booooring. No count markers which usually help. And she does the same thing over and over. On mile three she does some squats. Good stuff. But thats it.

I did sweat though !
Leslie Sansone and Jessica smith are lot less boring - in my opinion.
And Richard Simmons is fun !",1510099200,,289,4.160714285714286
8179159,4,B000NL5WTU,"I own several walking DVD's - when you live in a cold weather city (4 months of winter) you need something you can easily do inside.  I did like this DVD - it is easy to follow and I like the instruction (and the instructor) - I actually felt like I used all of my muscle groups including my stomach (this is a good thing).  This is a really good DVD.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is pretty long and I felt it beginners should not use it.  If you are no stranger to in house walking routines, then this is a great one for you!",1456876800,,551,3.849557522123894
8179160,5,B000NL5WTU,"The instructor PJ O'Clair  is incredible.  The tips she provides on good form are fantastic.  I've learned so much about what should be going on when I do various common exercises.  This is a 3.5 mile walking work out that takes 50 minutes.  She says you will burn 350 - 400 calories per workout.

I think this is a good video for new or experienced  exerciser.  It is all very low impact.  Involves arms and legs.",1450828800,,414,4.342105263157895

8179164,5,B000NL5WTU,"Best queing I've ever heard on any exercise video and I've done many!!! This is a tough workout!! I've been doing the Leslie Sansone videos for almost two years regularly and this still made me sweat and muscles were a tad bit sore. I needed this break and variety from Leslie and its a welcome one that will be added to my rotation. There are no really hard movements here but all the muscles in your legs and arms will definitely get a workout. She rotates from plain walking, to knee lifts, to heels down, to a few squats, side steps and that's about as complicated as it gets but she keeps it moving at a very fast brisk pace from the minute the warm up is over. Its about a good 52 mins of solid workout. And her stretch is awesome. And once again, her queing is beyond awesome!!!!",1423612800,,786,4.246666666666667

8179167,3,B000NL5WTU,"I don't know why I even bother to get it from the library....it disappoints every time. Don't buy it. You'll be bored after 10 minutes. I can never do the whole thing (50 min, I think).

The music is the same the whole time- barely loud and changes minimalle. The instructor is boring, jokes lamely from time to time ( she sure is no Leslie Sansone). The pace is the same. Heart rate doesn't really jump up much....boring.

I get it to diversity my walks but get mad with it cause its just so ridiculously BLAND.",1373155200,,512,4.322916666666667
