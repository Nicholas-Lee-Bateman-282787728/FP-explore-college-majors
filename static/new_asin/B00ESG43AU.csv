5940044,5,B00ESG43AU,"Hated the idea of two parts for season 6, steel not crazy about it. Now for what you're getting. One of the best season ever. The price is just right, again I don't know why it had to come in two parts. With the tow parts togeather you get 21 shows for just over $40. Owen all six seasons this is a great season, don't miss out on it !!! I give it 5 stars. Have a good day and my the Lord be with you.",1387152000,3,401,3.6744186046511627

5940050,5,B00ESG43AU,"For any fans of the now defunct TV series, this is a must have.  The episodes included are among the best.  They feature Barry Van Dyke more prominently than some previous seasons and show the iconic Dick Van Dyke at his versatile best.  It was worth the wait, but I hope it is not as long before the final episodes become available.",1390521600,2,333,4.338709677419355

8608910,5,B00ESG43AU,If you have season 5 YOU'D BETTER GET THIS SEASON TOO!  The end of season 5 is an intense and amazing program in multiple parts that continues into season 6!  It will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat!  I feel sorry for the people who aired these programs on live TV and had to wait an entire summer for the next season to conclude the story.  The other episodes we've viewed so far from this season are also very imaginative and mind blowing.  Very entertaining!  Characters are great and the production value very high!  DVD's play flawlessly.,1528156800,,554,4.48
8608911,4,B00ESG43AU,"They updated the series intro and tried to add occasional themes of a more serious nature.  The Last Resort in particular is a bit grim.  They also recycled one of their old plots, stranding Dr. Travis and his girlfriend in a small town (Trapped in Paradise) filled with larcenous people willing to kill to keep their secret.  Other than that, its pretty much business as usual.  There are no surprises, they didn't stray that far from lighthearted subject matter.  Whats not to like?",1515628800,,484,4.783132530120482
