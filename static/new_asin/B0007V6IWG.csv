2245617,3,B0007V6IWG,"As with other MG there is no this is how it's done,but more like guys screwing around in a garage,and doing what no one would ever do to a vehicle.and have no real use other than that one thing.which would be ok if they showed you how they build something.",1378771200,,256,4.14

2245622,5,B0007V6IWG,"I got this as a birthday gift for my two year old nephew. He and his three year old brother LOVE this show. Over the holidays, both would bug me constantly to watch this show, and I even caught the two of them playing ""monster garage"" on one of their own toy vehicles. I personally find the narration a bit overdramatic, and most of the time the races seem very staged...but my nephews do love it and that is what counts most. I will be getting the second season for my other nephew when he turns four.",1167523200,,502,4.185567010309279

8052200,1,B0007V6IWG,"The TV Show's OK, but trying to Watch it using Amazons Video Service, is mind-numbingly Horrific.

The PS3 version of the Software annoys the hell out of me, because the Controls are un-responsive.
I can't get rid of the On-Screen Overlay, telling me how long the Video is, and what video is coming up next.

The XBOX360 version of the Software works pretty well, but you still have to deal with the Low-Quality Picture.
Granted, I knew that when I bought it, so THAT part, atleast, is no surprise.

Personally, my ISP is crap, and it only loads 3mbps...

I wish Amazon would make my Purchased Video Titles Available to Download, so I can watch the videos without all the Buffering every 30 seconds...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playback Issues:

Episode 1 ""Mustang Mower"" - You can Blatantly get the Impression, that this is NOT the 1st episode, because the Narrator ""SHWAG"" states that Jesse James is Returning for ANOTHER episode of Monster Garage.

Episode 5 ""Freezer Burn"" - Shortly after the 41 minute mark, the Video has a Video Corruption issue.
You can tell this episode was on a VHS tape, because the Images is warped, and the Audio cuts in & out.

Episode 6 ""Grim Ripper"" - They CLEARLY explain to you that this is the 9th Episode, not the 6th. So CLEARLY, Amazon dropped the ball somewhere.
This means that I was short-changed 3 full episodes on my Purchase.",1449705600,,1430,4.953974895397489
