Most of this is other people giving their opinions of Bruce. - Some actually met and knew him.
It is a treat to see Bruce's widow Linda Lee - and daughter Shannon Lee.
There are clips of Bruce and trivia I never knew - but nothing can compare to interviewing a 'Living' person. -
And - with Bruce - I get the impression they pieced together what they could.
Actor Ed O'Neil is in this, I wondered why - but it turns out - he is some sort of Black-belt.
It's a good movie - but I reserve my 5-Start ratings - for the Best! Scott M.",1438387200,3,716,3.8120805369127515

This film did shed some light on the over dramatized film about Bruce's life and it was nice to hear from actors, MMA stars and his family.  Chuck Norris was not there which I found confusing.  Much of the information was stuff I already knew and sometimes I I was kinda bored by some of the commentary.  It was educational, I was happy to see new fighters and movie stars that are inspired by Bruce.  So it was a really good documentary but could have been better and would have been with Chuck Norris.",1410220800,,640,4.072

Its of course a lot of praising which is well justified for the legend but it doesn't shy away from showing people giving their opinion that maybe he wasn't the greatest or the father of mixed martial arts, which is a refreshing approach.  One point given by Ed O'Neil saying he believed in modern day a guy like Brock Lesner would destroy Bruce is an example.  Although lets face Bruce is the man and Brock would be crying for his momma within in no time.",1374710400,3,523,4.427083333333333

5132265,5,B00858MY5S,"Allison, I will be purchasing is blu-ray, because under the product detail language. It says english not contonese, I wasn't being nasty I didn't curse at all. In my comments reguarding the Bruce Lee, 7 blu-ray and dvd box set. I wrote in respose to a dissatisfied customer, because I was gonna buy this box set. So when I read his review, I decided that I wasn't gonna purchase this. If a lot of english speaking customers, bought this box set. And play it and the actors were speaking contonese, how angry do you think they would be. And I'm not taking about, the track settings you can set. For the subtitles that will appear, at the bottom of the screen. That you would have to read threw out the whole movie, would you want to sit. Threw out a movie and read subtitles when you can hear,the subtiltes are for ppl who can't hear. My comments are so customer won't waste their money, because I won't be one of them. I've purchase lots electronic's dvd's and blu-ray movies and been totally satisfed. I would never ever blame Amazon for, purchasing a box set that wasn't in english speaking language. But were in canonese speaking language, because I know Allison that some or most of their shipment comes from overseas. That's why! when I checked on Amazon's UK site first, in 20ll they had it in four different. Foregin lanuages and english was not one of them, but it had engish subtitles. If I had decided to purchase it from the UK Amazon, I would have regretted it. That why! I read the product details, and it didn't say engish only the 5.1. Subtitle reading words you would have to read, at the bottom of the screen threw out the movie. So Allison I thank myself for reading a customers review, for being the reason I did puschase this off the USA Amazon site this year. I feel Amazon should make customers aware, before they purchase this Bruce Lee 7 box collection set. That it is not in english speaking language, that it's only has english subtiltes setting tracks. So when you play tha dvd, you can read subtitles threw out. Each and every dvd or blu-ray, but I don't think they will do it. Because they are trying to make money, not lose money so if the customer's don't know it wouldn't matter. But me typing this review, for the engish speaking Bruce Lee fans like me who! watched all his movies, back in the early 70's. Bruce Lee was speaking in english on american movie screen, threw out the USA. And differnt languages in other countries, customer's please! when you purchase any type of asian movie or box set. Read the product detail below the picture, and read other customer reviews. Because it can be very helpful, that way you won't be wasting your money. I don't this my long review is being nasty in anykind of way, as Allison was teling the customer's that I was. People value other customer's reviews, when it comes down to a product. That you purchased or will be purchasing, it's a very helpful feedback.",1374451200,,2938,4.514071294559099
5132266,4,B00858MY5S,"The video furnished fine examples of Master Lee moves and part biography.
Although in my opinion some of these celebrities giving there feed back should have said less than more.
It is a fine example of saying to much and listening very little.

So in conclusion the video goes 50-50 part shining light on Master Lee and part Celebrity oriented to sell it, which i don't think its necessary because Bruce Lee products sell by themselves.
Get it to see the Master in action but thats it.
The only people that I cared to listen to who  Bruce was to them was his Wife and Daughter.",1372550400,,578,4.443396226415095

5132271,3,B00858MY5S,"I was very excited about this doc for two reasons, I love Bruce Lee and the director Pete McCormack who  made an amazingly fresh and insightful documentary ""Facing Ali""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Facing-Ali/dp/B002T9H2KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Facing Ali</a>&nbsp;so it had that going for it. Unfortunately .... its just another version of the already available&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-Bruce-Lee-Changed-the-World/dp/B001OLY1YU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How Bruce Lee Changed the World</a>&nbsp;and the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee-A-Warrior-s-Journey/dp/B00005UF83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey</a>.  I am happy to own them all and am glad I own this but I can't honestly say that anything in it created an ""ah ha"" moment for me. Lots of current day ""talking heads"" with the same clips from his very iconic films scattered throughout. Most of the bonus content is also available as bonus content on the spectacular 2 DVD set or BR set of Enter The Dragon....as well as the documentary previously mentioned ""A Warriors Journey""

Bottom line...
If you don't know about Bruce Lee but are interested ...get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0001US8FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;or the Blu Ray version... its a terrific film with hours of bonus content.  IF ... you have everything (as I am guilty of) complete your collection with this but expect the same content arranged slightly differently.

Other reviewers have commented on the content... basically his story told through people who knew him or are inspired by him with his voice and clips interjected. There isn't any new film to discover of Mr Lee so at this point all we can expect and what this delivers is moving the existing furniture to create a different vibe.",1368489600,13,2066,6.870229007633588
5132272,5,B00858MY5S,This documentary is the best so far. The take on his life from the mouths of his friends and family is the best. Also the people he has influenced over time. I am a fan. Bruce was that comet that passes our way once in a century.,1368057600,,229,3.893617021276596

There are other good documentaries out there on Bruce Lee, but it's that this one is different from the others and very well made with all the interviews and stories.  It goes with a time line on his life from his youth to his end. I really enjoyed the bonus features. Including his Hollywood audition in full, backyard training from his personal films, inspiration-global impact, a short summary of his action films and theatrical trailer. This dvd is like you were hanging out at a Bruce Lee remembrance get together and everyone was telling their own stories on how he impacted their lives while watching footage on him at the same time.  There was a bunch of new footage that I have never seen before and a little that I have on other dvd's.  It's motivating and inspirational.

It's thoughtful, without the overreliance on sensational theories about his death, and explains the lasting value of his philosophical approach to martial arts, and life.  The interviews with some of today's celebrities and athletes provides us with a sense of how much influence he really had over the years.  Definitely worth buying!

all time .Watching Bruce do his tryout for the part of Kato inthe Green Hornet
to some of  his moments on film. Bruce had lightning quick movements to his
great balance of a cat. Having his fomer wife Linda and his daughter give their input was very helpful also. Ther were other people who also gave their opinion and insight to Bruce Lee.

5132285,5,B00858MY5S,"I have to confess, right away, that I am a fan of Bruce Lee, and have been one since the seventies, when he conquered the world with ""Enter the Dragon,"" the film that made him a megastar - a short-lived one, since he unbelievably died early at the age of 32. And, as a fan that I am of Bruce, I have seen almost every documentary available about his life (and death). With that said, I can affirm that ""I am Bruce Lee"" is the best and most complete documentary about him ever made. This is the real thing.

Approved by Bruce Lee Enterprises, the documentary has lots of participation from Linda Lee Cadwell -- Lee's widow -, as well as daughter Shannon. It also has interviews with Lee's closest, known friends and disciples, such as Dan Inosanto, Richard Bustillo, and Bob Wall. There are interviews with some celebrities that were influenced by Lee, including Ed O'Neill, Mickey Rourke, Manny Pacquiao, Reginald Hudlin, Ray Mancini, Kobe Bryant, Diana Lee Inosanto, Gina Carano, Jon Jones, and others.

The film really covers almost every aspect of Lee's life by way of interviews or archival footage, including the classic interview at the Pierre Berton show in 1971; his early movies as a child actor; his first martial arts school in Seattle - Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute; Ed Parker's International World Karate Championships in Long Beach, California; his troubles with the Chinese community for teaching to non-Chinese people in Seattle; the birth of Jeet Kune do; the effect of the Manson murders on his life; his death in Hong Kong; and much more. Of course, there is plenty of information about his TV and film career, including the ""Green Hornet;"" being teacher of such Hollywood luminaries as James Coburn, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Steve McQueen, etc.; his films ""The Big Boss,"" ""Fist of Fury,"" ""The Way of the Dragon,"" ""Game of Death,"" and ""Enter the Dragon;"" and, of course, his project ""The Silent Flute,"" which was never done, as well as ""The Warrior,"" later was renamed ""Kung Fu,"" a role that went instead to David Carradine.

""I am Bruce Lee"" is it, believe me. This is the documentary on the master that we were waiting for, authorized by his family, and with never-before-seen material. The Blu-ray also includes Bruce Lee personal videos training and teaching the movie stars at his patio, his global impact, his Hollywood audition, and more. (USA, 2012, color and B&W, 94 min plus additional material).

5132288,4,B00858MY5S,"This latest video documentary about Bruce lee aired on spike channel only a couple of times. It has various people and celebrities from all walks of life talking about the influence and insparation of bruce lee and how he affected them personally like kobe bryant, mickey rourke, dana white, & jon jones just to name a few. The documentary does go into some depth about bruce lee's philosophys and views of martial arts and life in general. It was kind of an eye opener for me because I never really understood why bruce was so legendary, but this is one of the many documentary's that answered why. Bruce's wife before he died also appears to talk and discuss his life and legacy.",1351728000,12,681,4.590163934426229
