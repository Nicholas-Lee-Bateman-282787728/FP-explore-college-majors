8763826,1,B01GWBPB9A,I thought I was ordering the dvd of Silence of the Lambs.  I received a dvd of several unwanted films but Silence of the Lambs was among them.  I had/have no interest in the other films and don't have the exclusive cover art I expected of The Silence of the Lambs.  Rather disappointing.,1518393600,,287,4.377358490566038
8763827,5,B01GWBPB9A,"Awesome DVD.  I have watched this movie many, many times.  She shows her braveness going to talk with Dr. Lector.  She is just a rookie in the FBI (actually still in training)  and takes on an adventure that proves she will be a good FBI Agent.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is an excellent movie.  zsarsorrenson@gmail.com",1498176000,,336,4.409836065573771
