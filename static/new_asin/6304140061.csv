8158873,4,6304140061,"""The Visitor"" is an enjoyable 70s flick and somewhat of an Omen ripoff. It is a true piece of camp, and quite entertaining. One highlight is the delicious performance of Shelly Winters as a housekeeper with an attitude. The soundtrack is fittingly bizzare. The ""evil"" child in this case enjoys gymnastics and iceskating (!) and of course, excells at both. You'll laugh at the murderous iceskating montage. Some pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo and a weird ending make this a must for your collection.",982281600,,496,5.060975609756097
