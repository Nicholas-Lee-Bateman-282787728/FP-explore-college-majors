8467183,1,B005DL6J5G,"I ordered this movie mainly for the Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon because I was going to buy the single DVD but this was for $1 less and had two extra movies but what a waste of money.

The company that made these discs are great though because they are single disc instead of double sided and because they retained all there special features.

The movies are awful. Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon is a waste of time and when the monster attacks it is off screen, Sands of Oblivion is the best out of the three but is still not good just average at best, and Cyclops is the worst by far.

I would not waste my money on this pack knowing that these movies are bad.",1345939200,4,670,4.138461538461539
