7999665,5,B0000D0YTU,"I hope this comes back in stock sometime, because these episodes are great. Its the Odyssey ported to the 31st century, with space ships, time travel, trippy visuals, re-imagined characters and adventures from the original, and even some laughs. In the meantime, look for low-quality episodes on YouTube from user kitty9584.",1340323200,2,324,5.372549019607843
7999666,4,B0000D0YTU,An excellent selection from this great series.  Only slight thing that mars this release is the non-original score at the start.,1260057600,3,128,5.095238095238095
7999667,5,B0000D0YTU,Bought this DVD since I had a long time of wanting to watch Ulysses since it was one of my favorites cartoons when I was a child,1246147200,,128,3.7777777777777777
7999668,1,B0000D0YTU,"My one star is not for the cartoon but the DVD itself.

Over here in rainy old England, you can get the complete set of Ulysees cartoons (Yes, every episode ever made) for around 20 pounds. So for you, that would be about $40.

Hunt it down!!!!!

See ya.",1096761600,14,254,4.142857142857143
7999669,5,B0000D0YTU,"This is a series I have been hunting for. I rate it highly although it may be to do with childhood nostalgia. I agree, I'm sick of lazy DVD releases, how hard can it be to release the whole series. Surely it can't be for reasons of profit. Yes is is available in french as an entire series.",1093651200,3,290,4.017241379310345
7999670,5,B0000D0YTU,"Well I don't really know what to think. Ulysees is an amazing cartoon and should be bought by everyone who's ever seen it, but the formats is what's bothering me. For the past few years since DVD first started I have been waiting for all the 80's cartoons that I loved so much to be released.
Well, now they are all starting to come out, but they are coming out poorly. Transformers is a perfect set as far as I'm concerned and all the other 80's cartoons should be released in the same way. But it's not the case, the first one that bothered me was Batman the animated tales. It should definitely  be in a box set. Next was the Super Mario bros show, released badly by Animation Station.
This company ""Animation Station"" are releasing all the DIC cartoons such as Heathcliff, The Legend of Zelda, Jayce and the wheeled warriors, Mario, Sonic (I think), Cops etc.
Personally I don't think we should stand for it. They have these cartoons and they are waiting until they have sold all that they can in these rubbish random DVD sets before they release box sets.
Think about it, Zelda is only 13 episodes, would it have really been so hard to release that season in one. I don't think so.
Anyway, until I am certain that sets will not be released I refuse to buy any of them. Except TMNT (Original) of course.
Where's the rest of the cartoons?
We want Inspector Gadget, Captain N, Galaxy high, The Real Ghostbusters, Thundercats etc.
Don't stop now.",1082851200,13,1447,4.481060606060606
