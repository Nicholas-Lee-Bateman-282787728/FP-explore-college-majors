In 1999 or 2000 we came upon the Black Sheep Bistro this little restaurant in Tustin California recommended to us by some friends for Chef Rick's Spanish paella. He cooked it outdoors on the restaurants patio just like we had experienced at restaurants in Spain and it was fantastic, best paella we have ever had in the States to what we had in Spain. I really enjoy this DVD, I haven't made everything that Chef Rick demonstrates but I'm a pretty big fan of ""How It's Made"" on the Discovery Channel and enjoy watching food being prepared.",1471564800,,607,4.527272727272727
