8192149,5,B000PKG96Y,Looks like a new series for our adventuring angels. Watching to see if there is more to come.,1420329600,,93,4.222222222222222
8192150,1,B000PKG96Y,"Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.

I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.

Anyway on to the facts

- DVD contains 1 episode
- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs
- No English dub
- Is worthless

And lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.

Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows.",1309392000,,699,4.56
8192151,4,B000PKG96Y,"The series opening song is so catchy.

Being the Galaxy Angel fan that I am, I had to get Galaxy Angel Rune in order to become closer to completing my collection.  I knew what I was getting when I ordered this.  One Episode.  Sure it is a bit of a steep price for one episode, but just wait until the other DVD's of the series is released at an SRP of 49.99!

The thing I really liked about this is that they released it as it was released in Japan keeping it authentic.  I do not watch dubs unless I am desperate to see anime on TV or something, so having just a subtitled DVD is great.  The extras are pretty good too.  Clean opening is always a plus for me.  I liked the concert footage as well.  I was only disappointed by the sound quality.  It was less than enjoyable but still ok to listen to.  My favorite performed song on the concert was Satomi Akesaka's performance of ""Oyasumi...""  I have always loved the duet from Mika Kanai and Satomi Akesaka, and the performance was just as good.  I recommend this if you are a Galaxy Angel Fan.  I have never got series from Bandai Visual so I do not know if there will ever be a box set of this series or not so I would grab the separate volumes.  Not to mention, with the extras they are giving you, it's well worth the money spent!",1191628800,,1285,4.120967741935484
8192152,2,B000PKG96Y,"I have all of the previous seasons of Galaxy Angel and enjoyed them. When I purchased this one I sadly did not pay attention to the running time.

It has one 30 minute episode. For the current Amazon price 17.99 this is way overpriced.

The episode itself is very good but sadly the company making this decided to cash in on the fans. I will wait for a season box set to come out.",1185926400,4,380,4.121621621621622
8192153,3,B000PKG96Y,"The sequel to the popular moe comedy Galaxy Angel is finally here and as a fan of the original I'll say that this new series delivers the same good times of its predecessor.

The main characters are related in some way with the original cast of Galaxy Angel for example Apricot Sakuraba is Milfeulle's younger sister, Anise Azeat is in the Angel Troupe thanks to Mint Blancmanche, Nano-Nano Pudding has the resemblance of Vanilla H is not that she's like her is because she is the weird of the group also is the youngest and has green hair, and unlike Vanilla she's all smiles and talks a lot.  One character that captured my attention was this ""villain"" that doesn't look like one, in fact he's friendly looking but as always looks are always deceptive, he's masochist, manipulative and if he wants he can even conquer the galaxy .

This is a five stars series but the reason why I gave it three was because of not enough content, this DVD has only one episode of 24 minutes, the rest are the concerts of the seiyu cast and there is no dubbing.

Cons:
- Only one episode.
- No dubbing.

Pros:
- Vivid colors, fluent animation.
- It's a BLACK COMEDY ( Unlike its predecessor ).

If you're a fan of the original show buy it, but remember it's only one episode in the DVD, so you better think that twice before the purchase.",1184112000,3,1322,4.419753086419753
