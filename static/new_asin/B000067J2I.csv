SYNOPSIS--
Juan Obreon (Wilde) discovers he's impregnated one of twin sisters (De Carlo  2). The girl becomes an unfortunate casualty of a range war her grandfather (Qualen) who's also killed, is waging against a local Don. Oberon's newborn son and high-spirited sister-in-law (De Carlo  1)  both barely survive. The story devolves into one of relentless, near-obsessive revenge on Obreon's part, and features a quite good Sierra Mountain climax.

Has an excellent supporting cast. Watch for Frank DeKova (Chief Wild Eagle on the 60's sitcom, F TROOP) as Martinez, also Stuart Whitman as a vaquero and TV Lone Ranger Clayton Moore as a lieutenant.

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and an honest price make it a worthwhile purchase.

I used to like it better when I used to go to the movies. We both have grown a little bit older. Stangely Yvonne de Carlo hasn't. At least in this movie.",1220400000,4,228,4.204545454545454

7963408,3,B000067J2I,"On a whole, I am not usually a fan of western films. However, I gave this a try because of the role played by Yvonne De Carlo. She does a good job here of playing the role of twin sisters-one demure one fiery. The name of the film relates less romance and more revenge as De Carlo and Wilde set off to avenge the death of De Carlo's demure sister. Its good for a western!",1372723200,,371,3.96
