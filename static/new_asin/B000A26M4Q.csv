8185992,5,B000A26M4Q,"This is one of the more compelling war DVD I've purchased recently. While most of the documentaries you see focus on one war or period of time, this one, filmed during World War II, decides to look at the overall history of war in America and how it related to the war that the country was fighting at the time. As such it successfully makes the case that there was not much difference between fighting against the British in 1776 and fighting against Hitler in the 1940s. It also shows that while America may have felt like the war was ""over there"" there were comepelling historical reasons for America to be fighting in Europe. It does so with soem great footage of the German enemy.",1147910400,,685,4.488
