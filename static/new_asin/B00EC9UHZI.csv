5901575,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I wish they would colorize the whole series of ""I Love Lucy"".  They would certainly sell a great deal of copies.....in fact....they could show it on network TV and it would probably do very well and be much more entertaining than what is presently on TV these days. They would probably get a great deal more fans. Can't wait to get my copy.",1377302400,14,340,4.396825396825397
5901576,4,B00EC9UHZI,"I really cannot fully review this I LOVE LUCY CHRISTMAS dvd, for the simple reason that I've yet to see it.  Colorization, for the most part, looks dreadful.  Had a Laurel & Hardy film, WAY OUT WEST, that had been colorized, with purple walls, and green tints everywhere.  Horrible.  However I purchased an I LOVE LUCY dvd a few years ago, ""Lucy Goes to Scotland,"" that looked particularly good.  To say that this process has come a long way is an understatement.  So on that basis, I would recommend this new dvd out in Nov.  I only gave this review 4 stars, for obvious reasons.  So I don't think anyone will be too disappointed.  It also features, ""Lucy's Italian Movie,"" in which Lucille Ball gets into a grape-aquashing battle with another worker.  Heard she nearly drowned doing this scene, but it is still fun  to watch.  It features THREE episodes in original black and white, and the same shows in color.  I think the price is right.",1376524800,6,942,4.568862275449102

5901583,4,B00EC9UHZI,"All in all the DVD was a great purchase, but I'm pretty pissed at CBS for making the flashbacks in black-and-white. This is just my opinion, but I think it's a really messed up way for CBS to get ratings. CBS doesn't air this Christmas special as often as they should; that's the main reason why I bought it. I hope there will be an option in the future to purchase the complete colorized version in the future.",1481932800,,411,4.282051282051282

5901585,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I have seen every episode of I Love Lucy & love all of the episodes. I'm so used to seeing them in black & white that it looks kinda funny in color (in a good way, of course). But I enjoyed watching it & seeing it in color for the very first time. Now I see how RED Lucy's hair really is as well as the normal everyday settings, clothes etc... in color.

5901589,4,B00EC9UHZI,"I purchased 2015 version of I Love Lucy which it does not include the full episode of the christmas in color on the bonus so I decide to purchase this. I wish in the future that they have more color episodes in dvd, even complete series in color. However, I still preferred black & white because somehow the color makes people older but color version can let you see what their clothing and furniture color",1455926400,,406,4.426666666666667

One has to wonder why the Xmas episode was never in syndication. Colorization process used for these could have been better. Too many shades of blue were used for the Xmas episode.

5901626,5,B00EC9UHZI,Oh this was wonderfully changed to color. I read other reviews before buying and they were right on the money when they described how good the colorization was. We all sat down as a family with two in the crowd real Lucy fans. Everyone enjoyed the Christmas show seeing the old vintage toys under the tree. It was especially great to see one of the old fashioned decorated trees with tinsel and we did in the 50's! I will be buying the second DVD that goes with this soon.,1421107200,2,472,4.314606741573034

5901634,3,B00EC9UHZI,"I just saw the colorized ""job-switching"" episode. The colorizing is so good (apart from the artificial look of Lucy's and Ethel's hair), one might think the episode was originally filmed in color. Nevertheless, it looks wrong to me. I grew up on ""I Love Lucy"" during the '50s and have seen reruns countless times, but always in black and white until tonight. As good as the color is, I wish I hadn't seen it. Black and white is a major part of the charm of the show, and it seems disrespectful to mess with it. I'm now going to try to forget I ever saw the colorized episode. It's a shame that young people are growing up thinking that everything must be in color.",1417910400,4,664,4.362903225806452

5901685,5,B00EC9UHZI,I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.I RECENTLY ORDERED COLORIZED CHRISTMAS I LOVE LUCY.I AM HAPPY TO ADD THIS DVD TO MY I LOVE LUCY COLLECTION.,1389225600,,138,4.346153846153846
5901686,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I have always loved I Love Lucy. I thought I had seen every episode, but have never seen this particular episode. It was neat to see Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel in color for the first time. As many reviews have mentioned, the color quality is less than true to life. However, I found it fun as a novelty. Good news is the DVD also contains the episode in B&W, so those that hate the colorization can still enjoy the episode in it's original form.",1389052800,,446,4.258823529411765
5901687,5,B00EC9UHZI,We enjoyed the I Love Lucy colorized Christmas special.  The color is realistic and Lucy's hair is the perfect red.  I would recommend it for anyone who is a Lucy fan.,1389052800,,167,4.354838709677419
5901688,5,B00EC9UHZI,"Great quality, great picture and well worth the purchase.. To those that complain about the color, you're crazy! The quality is great... Definitely an awesome gift for I Love Lucy fans!!",1388880000,,186,5.032258064516129
5901689,5,B00EC9UHZI,"Following on the heels of ""Bewitched"" which colorized their first two black and white seasons CBS has decided ( and wisely so) to colorize the entire ""I Love Lucy"" library of episodes. This is a smart move by the company as it gives them the chance to re release the entire series again and it is geared at a youthful audience who detests anything in Black and White.

 This little gem is a prelude to what we will get in the upcoming year as ""I Love Lucy-Season 1"" will be released on Blu Ray in full colorized format. If this DVD is any indication at all we will  be treated to a great new version of ""I Love Lucy"" never seen before. I for one am very happy.

 Two of the episodes in this collection (the Christmas episode and the Lucy Stomping the Grapes episode) aired on CBS on December 20th, 2013 and was the highest-rated show of the night! It is obvious people still love Lucy after all these years!",1388707200,2,907,4.280701754385965
5901690,5,B00EC9UHZI,Love the colorized episodes on this disk! Arrived promptly and in good packaging. Going to make watching this a Christmas tradition.,1388620800,,132,5.333333333333333
5901691,5,B00EC9UHZI,Classic funny- we just wanted to have it to add to our Christmas Holiday Viewing DVD 's. i love that it is in color or Black and White so you can chose how you want to watch it.,1388620800,,177,3.6842105263157894
5901692,1,B00EC9UHZI,prefer b&w - a real disappointment...at least their could have been added commentary...save your money and watch the full length originals...,1388188800,6,141,5.761904761904762
5901693,5,B00EC9UHZI,"Great vintage coloring set on clear filmed negatives by the old Technicolor process. The late Lucille Ball was asked if she would mind having her most famous black & white TV sitcom colorized. ""No, not at all. Just make sure my hair color is right"". (Quote from Entertainment Tonight circa 1985)
CBS owns the I Love Lucy TV series. Their recent TV network  broadcast of that show colorized was $hameless shrewd test marketing. An ad for the Christmas episode DVD was even aired during the broadcast!
It is obvious that all the other episodes have been colorized. More is on the way.",1388188800,,582,4.705882352941177
5901694,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I always thought colorization was pretty bad, with the exception of ""Holiday Inn"" which is decent and some scenes very good.
These newly colorized episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" are unbelievable (they even got the reds right) and if you didn't know they were colorized, you'd think they were in Technicolor.
Let's hope the company that did these get a chance to do some musicals, that because of budget restraints or other reasons were shot in black and white.",1388016000,4,455,4.772151898734177

5901697,5,B00EC9UHZI,Who doesn't love Lucy be it in color or black and white. The color was very sharp and bright. LOVED IT. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Lucy...,1387670400,2,154,4.166666666666667
5901698,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I really enjoy seeing this show in color, a whole new dimension, and previous to it's release a few years back, an episode not seen since the 50's.",1387238400,5,147,4.285714285714286
5901699,5,B00EC9UHZI,"The videos arrived ahead of schedule in excellent condition.
The price is near what its selling for in stores.
These are Christmas gifts, I'm sure they will love Lucy!",1386720000,2,167,4.793103448275862
5901700,1,B00EC9UHZI,"Don't buy this DVD. Colorization looks as bad as ever. Colorization should never be used. It always looks phony and it destroys the original film which should not be allowed whether you consider it art or not. There is nothing wrong with Black and White and on todays HD sets and DVDs it looks better than ever, much more detailed than the awful colorized versions. I hope we have seen the last of these terrible DVD's. I Love Lucy is a classic so please leave it alone. No more Blasphemous Colorized versions.",1386028800,8,510,4.554347826086956
5901701,2,B00EC9UHZI,"Just an FY is on the colored Christmas special is on the I Love Lucy DVD for season 6 and the colored Scotland ep is on the ""I LOve Lucy The Movie"" dvd. I believe the boxed set of the complete series has all three as well, that's what a friend told me, but I bought each season as they came out so I can only attest to the other two. So if you have those, may not be worth getting this.",1385424000,3,386,3.7195121951219514
5901702,5,B00EC9UHZI,These are some of the funniest TV shows that were ever made. Great classic Television perfect for the whole family. Wish they still made TV shows like these.,1384992000,2,157,4.642857142857143
5901703,5,B00EC9UHZI,"This I love Lucy disc is sure to please those who love colorization.............and those who hate it, as well. The folks at CBS have given Lucy fans a chance to see three episodes in color, and I think it looks very nice. But those who absolutely hate colorizing can enjoy the shows in good 'ol black-and-white as well. The ""grape stomping"" episode is the classic one here, but the other two are entertaining as well. If you love Lucy, and don't already have these on one of the other many Lucy DVDs, this is a nice way to get a small sampling. There are no extras, just the three episodes, and with the choice here, if you like the episodes, you will enjoy them, whether you are of the ""colorizing"" or ""classic black-and-white"" persuasions! It should be noted that the Christmas show is a newly-colorized version, improved over the older, 1990 colorized release, so all three shows reflect the later, better colorizing techniques. Update 12/22/13: The CBS telecast of the Christmas show and the grape-stomping episodes caught 8.9 million viewers to win it's timeslot. Just goes to show that people still ""Love Lucy!""",1384819200,16,1118,4.7979274611398965
5901704,5,B00EC9UHZI,Lucille Ball is so funny. I just love watching any shows that she is in. The colorized version is a plus for me.,1384560000,2,112,3.9130434782608696
5901705,5,B00EC9UHZI,"All 3 of the episodes on this disc look sensational in color, but the grape stomping episode (with the famous grape fight sequence) looks absolutely stunning in color. All 3 episodes look like they were actually shot in color.

I already have the complete series in b&w, but I would gladly buy every season again if they were all re-released in color.",1384214400,23,351,4.661290322580645
5901706,5,B00EC9UHZI,This DVD includes the Christmas episode and two other episodes (grape stomping and Lucy goes to Scotland) in BOTH color AND black and white versions (so there are a total of 6 episodes).  The Christmas episode flashbacks are in black and white even in the colorized version.,1383696000,9,274,4.829787234042553
5901707,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I went to Target this morning and I saw 3 of these dvd's left! I was shocked because I thought they were coming out Tuesday nov, 5th! Anyways, I give this dvd a 6 if I could! Picture quality is crisp!!! I heard that these 3 colorized versions were a test pilot for the blu ray boxed set in 2014, where you may choose to watch all of them in B&W or color.",1383436800,48,354,3.863013698630137
5901708,4,B00EC9UHZI,"This is a classic episode of a legendary show and the color looks much better than it did on the original release on the 2007 DVD series, but only the current at the time segments were colorized.  The flashbacks are still in black-and-white.  I understand it to a degree, but if it's ""Colorized for Kids of All Ages"" I took it as the entire episode should be in color. I posted some comparisons for people to see the difference.  The changes from the previous colorization are a much sharper, a little more picture, and some drastic changes like the stockings went from red to green, and their apartment changed colors.

Final verdict is I definitely recommend.  The colorized portion is now shown with the flashbacks, and even with the misled front cover (it does say flashbacks in B&W on the back) it is definitely worth having.

See the 5 pictures below.",1383264000,62,857,4.642384105960265
5901709,5,B00EC9UHZI,"I'm looking forward to this. I have the Christmas ""flashback"" that I recorded on VHS probably close to 20 years ago. I watch it every Christmas. The credits and ""in the present"" moments are colorized, and it looks pretty gaudy. But all of the flashbacks are B&W.",1383004800,,262,4.595744680851064
5901710,5,B00EC9UHZI,"Not sure how it will come out in color but if its anything like Lucy goes to scotland it should be great. I was lucky to get that with the complete series. I have also recently bought her other two series, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy, both are fantastic and are just as great as I love lucy. This is saying something as I am a die hard fan of hers. She was and always will be the funniest person on tv or in life. She had a true gift and no one can ever match her in my opinion.",1383004800,,480,3.762376237623762
5901711,2,B00EC9UHZI,"I was sad to realize that I love lucy was completely in Black & White on dvd.
The episodes I thought were in color such as Lucy in scotland were in black & white only.
I was hoping the colorized versions would be bonus material.
My favorite episode was not mentioned for colorization Lucy meets Superman.
There should be two versions of this classic series available on dvd. The complete series in black & white to keep the vintage original look, and one in color for the more modern look.
THE COMPLETE SERIES SHOULD BE IN COLOR AND INCLUDE THE LONG LONG TRAILER AS A BONUS MOVIE.
This series should be on tv in a colorized version, and for those who prefer black & white should watch it on dvd.
I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way about this great vintage tv show.",1382400000,5,776,4.285714285714286
5901712,5,B00EC9UHZI,I already ordered my copy of colorized I Love Lucy Christmas.  Not only is the 1956 clip episode in color but two others Lucy stomping grapes and Lucy In Scotland dream.  This is a delightful treat especially since CBS will be airing the clip show and the grape stomping episode on TV in December.  I can't wait.,1380758400,31,312,4.43859649122807
5901713,5,B00EC9UHZI,"Fantastic news, finally all 3 of the colorized I Love Lucy's are being released in one grand package.  Colorizing, the way it's done today, (& please can we stop judging the newest wonderful process of colorization based on primitive attempts from the 1980's like the old '80's color version of Way Out West?) the newest colorizing looks perfect, take a look at the wonderful colorizing of Bewitched Seasons 1 & 2 and the colorized I Dream of Jeanie season 1 for the best examples.  I have seen these colorized episodes of I Love Lucy including the Italian Movie color episode and they look great (though Bewitched looks more colorful, the Italian movie color job here is a bit faded looking, but if you turn the color dial up all the way on your TV you'll get a nice color version.)  Please future colorizers out there, stop being afraid of turning the color intensity dial up, what's the purpose in colorizing if the color is only lightly there?

Now the next mandatory step is to release the entire I Love Lucy series in beautiful bright intense living color (enough with the faded color jobs, take a cue from Bewitched's color versions and do it right, with intensity), and by the way, while they're at it, PLEASE colorize the classic 39 of The Honeymooners series too!!  I'd buy both of these series in beautiful color in a NY minute.

And to the oh so vocal haters out there, as opposed to the silent majority of color lovers, your juvenile vicious comments are no longer read or paid any attention to here.  We love color and always will no matter how ugly you get.  As I've said in countless kindheartedly ways before, if you don't like color, keep your b/w versions and watch till your eyeballs see b/w fulltime, don't ruin the fun and enjoyment of beautiful color versions for the majority of the rest of us color lovers.  Life and TV is so much better in color, just like life, it's a color world, live it, love it!  If you only want b/w, buy it and be happy, and keep quiet.  Stop trying to tell the rest of us what we should and should not like, I know what I like and I like COLOR.

Colorizing, I love love love it, you will too!",1380067200,9,2143,4.438775510204081
