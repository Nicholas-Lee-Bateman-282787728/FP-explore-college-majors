The songs are amazing and this drama has it all. I actually cheered out loud while watching this because it was so fun to watch. It does have some slow bits, but they are few and far outweighed by the beauty of the actors. I cant say anything about the dvd set though. I watch Korean dramas through Drama Fever app.",1513987200,,460,4.179775280898877

8466254,4,B005D24KE2,"It kept my interest. Most of the actors did well. I thought that the actor who played Mary's dad, was a ridiculous character. Some of the dialogue for his part seemed retarded. It is hard to understand Mary's lack of backbone. The ending left unanswered questions.",1412035200,,264,4.760869565217392
