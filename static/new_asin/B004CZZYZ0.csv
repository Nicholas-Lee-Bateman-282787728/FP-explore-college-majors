8424422,5,B004CZZYZ0,"The Italian ""Octopus"" series gets better with each release.  Filmed in Italy, the slight datedness of this classic actually enhances the presentation.  Main characters well acted, and are sustained through several episodes, though eventually others take over the fight against Mafia & Friends.  I actually do love it!",1526428800,,317,5.5625
