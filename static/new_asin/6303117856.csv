567371,4,6303117856,"If you like the attitude and pace of classic movies and you like baseball, you're likely to enjoy this family friendly film.  It's a lot less hokey than you might expect, mostly due to Paul Douglas' performance as the crusty manager, who'd just as soon stay crusty -- until he gets hit upside the head by an angel with an attitude.  Janet Leigh does her usual excellent job -- she's a cute and feisty ""Hints from Heloise"" type reporter who wanders into the all-male world of 1950s baseball reporting.  The little girl who sees the angels is somehow really endearing without being over the top (maybe because Disney didn't make this version - the old MGM did).  It's an enjoyable little story with more than a few laughs -- and probably a must see for true lovers of baseball.",1176163200,5,775,4.553956834532374

567374,4,6303117856,"This movie is a lot of fun. It is great to see baseball of that era portrayed. Look for the scene where the Pirate Pitcher returns to the mound without his glove. In this era, players would leave their gloves on the fielld after the inning was completed.

  The baseball scenes are fairly well done and Paul Douglas is very believable as  manager. Janet Leigh is very good as the columnist and eventaul love interest as the manager.",1171065600,,432,4.5
567375,1,6303117856,"This great baseball movie was supposed to be released on January 30th, however, after I ordered the movie (two weeks before and being a member of Amazon Prime), I was informed the movie would not be available for another four to six weeks.  Then after speaking to one of Amazon's friendly salespersons (a great new service), I was told the movie is not available at all.  So I would advise anyone trying to order this movie to wait, and see if it's going to be sold at all.  Too bad.  Much better than the remake.",1170374400,7,513,4.368421052631579
567376,5,6303117856,"You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this very well written, directed and acted movie that just happens to be about baseball.  The script is intelligent, funny and thoughtful all at the same time.  Paul Douglas, Keenan Wynn and Janet Leigh are all at the top of their game for this one.  What I liked most is the complete lack of ""special effects"" - you never see the angels helping the Pittsburgh Pirates, which makes it so much more preferable to the weak gimmick-laden Danny Glover remake of a few years ago.

A plus is all of the location shooting in Pittsburgh in its heyday in the early 50's, including Forbes Field, one of the great old ballparks that was replaced by the god-awful Three Rivers Stadium, since replaced by one of the ""new-old"" ballparks that tries to recapture the feel of places like Forbes Field.

This is a great movie for the whole family, and has one of those feel-good foundations that charges movies like ""Miracle on 34th Street"", only this time it's angels instead of Santa Claus.  You'll love it.",1151884800,22,1036,4.572972972972973
567377,5,6303117856,"I loved this movie. It's cliche to say, but they don't make 'em like this anymore. A decent, but also very funny movie that doesn't get too soppy about the kid-melting-the-heart-of-a-tough-guy thing. Made when Hollywood was not afraid of people who believed in the power of prayer, and were able to cheer when a man recognized his need for redemption. Listen for the ingenious use of garbled voice-over to cover the colorful language of the ""hero."" I especially enjoyed the court-room debate over the existence of angels. This movie is family friendly, but has an intelligent, mature script. I'd give it 5 popcorns, two hankies, and a resounding, ""Praise the Lord."" Just smile, and enjoy it.",1149984000,19,691,4.9655172413793105
567378,4,6303117856,"Looking for a movie with good baseball, good for family and representative of the world of the 50's this is it.

This is a real family movie and worth your time and money, I find it more interesting in terms of the way things are different now and then.

As a history buff one of the things I've noticed about this movie is the acceptance of religion.  In one of the climatic scenes of the movie this is assumed that of COURSE the baseball comish believes in Angels, and to say no to that possibility is to say no to scripture.  The positive portrayal of religion is another change.

It is interesting to see that the idea that scripture was able to be questioned as unthinkable.

Look for Mrs. Cleaver (Barbara Billingsley) in a bit role that is rather cute.",1130803200,6,759,4.385714285714286
567379,5,6303117856,"Tired of all those sappy, mystical, messianic- driven ""baseball"" movies? Heard enough phrases like ""build it and they will come?"" Just for the heck of it, watch this one and get a taste of a little grit, a lot of laughs, and a dose of realism. It puts the story of baseball within the context of people's lives- their struggles and their triumphs- through the use of good character development and believable relationships.  While angels become part of the plot(I know- how realistic can that be? -you ask), this is nonetheless an honest perspective on the challenges that face us all; it makes the statement that, whether in baseball or in life, we can control our own actions. It just so happens that the film's depiction of ballplayers is also more authentic than what you'll see in more recent ""sport"" films. This is a great movie from a time when a good story was the starting point for a script. It's got drama, pathos and humor- with excellent performances, especially from the main star, Paul Douglas. Do yourself a favor and enjoy it.",1120780800,34,1043,4.699453551912568

Didn't matter---loved the Pirates and still do.

567488,4,6303117856,"This is a fun baseball movie from the early 1950s.  It is a vintage ""time capsule"" type movie that one needs to be in the mood to watch.  It is quaint by today's standards.  I have seen it more than once and completely enjoy it every time.  The special effects, such as they are, are quite dated.  Essentially the movie requires viewer to simply suspend their sense of reality and just enjoy the movie for what it is.

Paul Douglas shares a staring role with the more iconic Janet Leigh.  In this movie, Paul Douglas plays a baseball team manager.  A few years before, Paul Douglas had played a player in another run baseball movie, ""It Happens Every Spring"" with Ray Milland.  I like them both a lot, but I think I like this one a little bit more as it is a bit of faith based morality story that really appeals to me.  Thank You...",1485043200,,833,4.282051282051282

567559,5,6303117856,"While the '94 version of this film shines in the final game sequence, overall this adaptation is by far the superior. Great acting, nice character development. I felt like I was watching a Baseball version of ""Miracle on 34th Street"" but with loads of originality. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1473984000,,287,5.0
567560,5,6303117856,"Sure, the 1994 remake was pretty good - after all, it had Danny Glover and a really solid Tony Danza - but if you're having druthers, go with the original 1951 Angels in the Outfield. Special effects being what they were back in those days, it opted to not show any celestial figures, and I think that added to its charm, allowed you to further exert your imagination. The fabling up of our national pastime is a timeworn plot device in cinema, a sample size of which ranges from It Happens Every Spring (1949) to Damn! Yankees (1958) to The Natural (1984) to Field of Dreams (1989) to Rookie of the Year (1993).

Angels in the Outfield works because of the fantasy gimmick and because of Paul Douglas. He plays Guffy McGovern, the huff-and-puff manager of the reeling Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates dwell near the cellar of the National League. They're the laughing stock of the sporting world. They're clowns on the field. For cripes sake, what other team has three runners ending up on the same base? It doesn't help their rep that Guffy McGovern is this foul-mouthed lout who often times wades in, fists swinging.

Enter newswoman Jennifer Paige (Janet Leigh) who writes household hints for the Messenger's ladies' page. She doesn't know thing one about baseball, except she's just been assigned to present a woman's perspective as to what the heck's wrong with the Pirates. Jennifer is horrified at Guffy's show of crudity and pens a scathing article blaming him for the Pirates' woes. Throw in the grudge-holding radio broadcaster (Keenan Wynn) whom Guffy got fired from his announcing gig with the Pirates, and it's a further stretch of bad road for our poor sap.

But, then, the archangel Gabriel takes an interest in the Pirates' fortunes, courtesy of nightly prayers from an 8-year-old orphan girl (Donna Corcoran) who happens to be a devout Pirates fanatic. So, here's Guffy suddenly hearing a voice of celestial persuasion. The disembodied voice makes a deal with Guffy. If Guffy curbs his cursin' and fightin', the team may just win a few more games, may even take the pennant. The Heavenly Choir Nine, composed of dead former baseball greats, will have his back. So, here's Guffy getting into a heated exchange with the ump, only this time he forgoes his, uh, colorful epithets in favor of Shakespearean quotes. The scene amuses.

""Guffy claims seraphs pals,"" maybe the newsrag headline screams. Because what are the odds that Guffy can keep his trap shut, can temper his temper? Paul Douglas, bear of a guy, gives his character big heart. In his hands, Guffy is a temperamental, boisterous loudmouth who, nevertheless, reluctantly melts in the presence of a sincere little girl, the same orphan who espies angels on the field. It's cute. Meanwhile, Janet Leigh holds it down as the level-headed adult in the room, and she's easy on the eyes, as well. It's a thankless role, but she's solid, too.

The film serves up an ample dose of verisimilitude in that scenes were shot on location - this is unusual in its time - at Forbes Field, the Pittsburgh ball park. It even makes use of actual Pirates game footage. There's even a sequence that features mock interviews with baseball greats Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb, songwriter Harry Ruby (who doesn't at all look like Red Skelton), and Bing Crosby who possessed 15% of the real-life Pittsburgh Pirates).

Since this was back in the 1950s, one simply couldn't have a movie in which the potty-mouth manager actually utters obscenities. Reportedly, the MGM sound crew arrived at the notion of having Douglas mouth the swear words and then recorded them backwards on the soundtrack so that they sounded like so much gobbledygook.

Guffy's big mouth lands him in hot water, anyway. With his team on the cusp of a pennant game against the New York Giants, he's got a smear campaign to overcome. I'm glad of how the story resolved itself. The softie in me was content. The chagrin of the rugged, do-it-myself individual in me was abated. And I loved how Guffy gives honor to his old pitcher. While mostly playing for chuckles, this movie offers up dramatic moments in spots in which a contemplative Douglas deftly demonstrates his acting chops. Listen, I liked the 1994 remake well enough. But there's something about this 1951 version, absent of modern-day CG razzle-dazzle, packed with playful bluster and old timey nostalgia and a certain wide-eyed innocence. It's an affectionate, whimsical take on our national pastime, made in an era in which baseball was practically a second religion, and a baseball park was as unto a cathedral. Angels in the Outfield isn't so solemn as all that. It's a goofball movie that's just looking to entertain you for ninety minutes or so. I say let it.",1473552000,,4742,4.846913580246913

I was a bit reluctant to order a manufactured on demand DVD (my first one), but was pleasantly surprised with problem free playback, nice sound and image quality..  You'll surely notice that several of Paul Douglas'  verbal tirades were intentionally 'scrambled' or 'muffled'  over, to mask his language, lol...  I was also pleasantly surprised to see Barbara Billingsley make a very, very brief cameo appearance (perhaps six seconds), as a coat or hat check lady.  And you'll surely recognize a few other memorable figures.

But also, the feeling for the orphans in the movie is neat.  Overall, this is a clean, fun, romantic comedy that you could watch with your kids and not have to worry about them seeing/hearing something bad (the bad language Paul Douglas' charachter uses at the beginning isn't actually heard, just implied through certain sound effects).

567987,4,6303117856,"Angels in the Outfield(released Oct/51)is a thoroughly charming movie directed by famed Clarence Brown,whose career went all the way back to 1920. He was said to be Garbo's favourite director(six times he worked with her)and he is tied with Altman and Hitchcock as the most Academy nominated director without a win(38!).The film stars a 21 year old Janet Leigh as one Janet Paige,a newspaper columnist and Paul Douglas as the irascible Guffy McGovern,the manager of the national league Pittsburgh Pirates. Douglas started out in the mids 30s on the Broadway stage but soon turned to radio to make his living,becoming very popular during the bigband era as the regular announcer for many bigband artists like Glenn Miller. Veteran actor Lewis Stone,whose career goes back to the teens in film(well known as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy series),is on hand as the baseball commissioner. Stone had worked with director Brown back in 1930 on a film called Romance. Also in the film are cameos by baseball legends Ty Cobb & Joe Dimaggio,along with the then real current co-owner of the Pirates,Bing Crosby and songwriter and baseball fan Harry Ruby. And watch for a young Barbara Billingsly(mom in Leave it to Beaver)as a hat check girl.
The story centers around the rough and tumble,no holds barred and gruff manager of the Pirates,Gruffy McGovern. Needless to say,his style of managing is to swear and punch first,then ask the pertinent questions later. Everytime he confronts,say an umpire,with words that make the air turn every colour of the rainbow,his voice is heard by us in a garbled manner(actually the dialogue played in reverse).Well it seems the boys from Heaven have been watching McGovern's antics for a long time and they are fed up. One day while out on the empty field,post game,looking for his lucky charm,a voice booms out of the darkness. He tells McGovern in no uncertain terms that he has to straighten up and fly right or else. McGovern is at first not convinced of the voices origin(an angel who says he sits at the right side of the archangel Gabriel,no less).The voice/angel tells McGovern to expect a miracle during the third inning of the next game. That very third inning arrives and his players are making plays which defy logic,and is especially a 180 from their lack of enthusiasm and sloppy play of recent games. McGovern is convinced and the angels are here to stay. McGovern,and we the viewers of course,are given a tantalizing clue as to the angels identities when it is hinted that they could be former baseball players of years gone by. From that time on the Pirates are on a winning streak and eventually rise from the bottom of the league to the top.
Everything would have copacetic if a certain little orphan girl named Bridget White(Donna Corcoran),from a certain Catholic orphanage hadn't suddenly started seeing the angels in the outfield...and in the infield! At first the Mother(played by Spring Byington)thinks it's too much sun and asks the accompanying sister(Ellen Corby,recalled as Mom on Little House on the Prairie) to take her under the stands briefly. When they return the girl is still sticking by her story that not only does she see angels behind all the players,but one on the scoreboard and one behind McGovern! Her tale gets passed around the stands and comes to a security guard whom columnist Paige knows. She writes about what the girl saw and McGovern goes to the orphanage to talk with the girl himself. Reporters following up the story and corner him at the orphanage,and then it starts to take on a life of its own in the media. Meanwhile McGovern and Paige have become very good friends and McGovern has fallen for little Bridget,and even plans on adopting her.
The team has come down to the final couple of games which will determine who will win the pennant. However the angels story has become so twisted and out of proportion that the baseball commissioner is called in to investigate. All goes well until a sports announcer,and McGoverns nemesis throughout the film Fred Bayles(Keenan Wynn),suggests that Bridget is there to testify because she is just trying to protect her future daddy. McGovern loses it and slugs Bayles for the umpteenth time. It is this action that severely upsets the angel/voice the most and the tie is severed between the two. The Pirates will have to play the final games on their own;win or lose.
The final game comes and McGovern against all opinion and his own instincts,puts in Hellman(Bruce Bennett).There is a method to the madness here. In one of McGoverns previous convos with the angel/voice it is said that they are going to be signing Hellman up for the next spring training. It is Hellmans last chance to make good and McGovern,now a changed man,is going to give him his chance,no matter what. And what pressure McGovern comes under,as it gets to the final inning,two men out and Hellman has loaded the bases. The film ends as McGovern,Paige and little Bridget stand in the bleachers looking on to an empty field speculating on just who those angels/players might have been with such names as Gehrig and Ruth thrown out as suspects(both just recently passed away).
A perfect ending to this little charmer. Brown directs with subtlety and his actors really have no fillers in lines or acting. Each actor slightly under acts so what you see you feel is more geared to what one might expect in the ""real"" world. Douglas' personality change from bad to good is wonderfully portrayed and Leighs' turn as the reporter,going from her naivety about the game in general to falling in love with McGovern,is the best example of this""naturalness"" I refer to as one could get. Little eight year old Donna Corcoran's performance is also manged deftly by director Brown who extracts a subtle and well played turn from her. We never ever actually see the angels,as Brown builds their inference and ""reality"" to such a point that there is no need;another aspect that I love about this film.
And oh yes,the voice of the angel that speaks to Gruffy from time to time. I listened and listened until I finally figured it out. It can't be anyone but famed actor James Whitmore(Them and SO much more).
Technically speaking the film is in full frame mode and the picture is clear and crisp(b&w).Extras include a wonderful Pete Smith short called Donkey Baseball,a Tom and Jerry cartoon,the radio show adaption of the film and the trailer.
All in all a highly recommended film and a beautiful charmer that will give you that feel good feeling for a while after watching it. The film is so engrossing that I found myself rooting for the Pirates more than once,especially during the final games! A must for your film library. 4-4 1/2 stars!",1325289600,5,6721,4.8605056669572795
567988,5,6303117856,"Great movie, now that my daughter  is in college in Pittsburgh, the movie makes more sense. Pittsburgh Pirates losing streak was  somewhat based on this movie story line.",1313280000,,170,5.035714285714286
567989,2,6303117856,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I like to compare 'It Happens Every Spring' with 'Angels in the Outfield' as they were filmed within two years of each other (1949 and 1951), are both about baseball and feature Paul Douglas in key roles. 'Spring' is a vastly superior film in almost every way. The protagonist, Vernon K. Simpson, played by Ray Milland, is a chemistry professor who, as a result of an accident, gains access to a wood repellent formula which he uses to become a star pitcher. It's a great fish out of water story where the introverted professor is thrust into the gruff baseball world, and must prove his mettle amongst street smart ballplayers. Douglas plays ally Monk Lanigan, a catcher who looks after Vernon, but is constantly at odds with him since the star pitcher is determined to keep his identity a secret so that his girlfriend and her father (the dean of the school), don't find out what he is up to.

In contrast, Douglas' role in 'Angels' is virtually a passive one. Here he's 'Guffy' McGovern, manager of the last place Pittsburgh Pirates, who has a chip on his shoulder. Throughout the first third of the movie, he's as mean as the film's antagonist, sports announcer Fred Bayles (Keenan Wynn) who's bitter after being canned as the Pirates' radio announcer at the behest of Guffy. Nothing is endearing or interesting about the Guffy character and one wonders why any club owner would keep such a surly person in charge of a baseball team (he's constantly berating his players after each game due to their poor play). Why is he so mean-spirited? The answer is simplistic: we find out much later on that apparently he was ditched by a woman for another ballplayer in his younger days!

Unlike Ray Milland's pitcher, who must actively overcome personal demons through self-actualized behavior, all Guffy has to do is to listen to an (unseen) angel in the outfield at the old Forbes Field Pirate ballpark advise him to keep his foul language in check and act a bit more graciously toward his fellow man; in exchange, through heavenly intervention, a few of the Pirate miscues in each game are reversed, resulting in the team's sudden improvement in the standings. All it takes is a Pirate winning streak and good old Guffy is no longer playing the part of the team misanthrope. Since Guffy is transformed into a good guy so early on in the film, the internal arc (self-conflict) is resolved.

Now with Guffy 'defanged', the rest of 'Angels' mainly features a polemic in favor of religion, pitted against scientific rationalism. Little Bridget White, a nine year old clairvoyant, is soon trotted out and she's the only one who can actually see the angels in the outfield. Also in the mix is the Mother Superior who's looking after little Bridget at the orphanage (the 'tough as nails' sister, is reminiscent of the nuns in 'The Sound of Music' who spunkily remove a spark plug from a car and prevent the Nazis from going after the fleeing Von Trapp family). Guffy is accused of being flat out crazy and the Commissioner of baseball is called in to determine whether he's acting toward the 'detriment' of the game. A creepy psychiatrist is cross-examined by the ever-belligerent broadcaster Bayles but both are made to look by fools when a Protestant Minister, a Rabbi and Catholic Priest testify in Guffy's defense--they argue that angels are certifiably real since they are referred to numerous times in both the Old and New Testaments.

After Guffy gets into a fistfight with Bayles, the angel concludes that he hasn't quite learned the lesson of 'turning the other cheek'. They'll be no more 'miracles' for the Pirates and they're now forced to win one last game for the pennant without heavenly intervention. Guffy must now put his 'faith' in a veteran pitcher whose performance of late has not been up to snuff. Of course the veteran bears down and ends up winning the game for his fellow Pirates. One additional happy-ending: Guffy will marry newspaper columnist Jennifer Paige (Janet Leigh) and they'll end up adopting little Bridget.

Speaking of Ms. Leigh, in her younger days, she certainly was most pleasing to the eyes--except here has little to do in this film; except perhaps cook dinner for Guffy and hug little Bridget, as the two cheer on the Pirates from the stands.

'Angels' has only one thing up on 'It Happens Every Spring': Many of the scenes were shot at the actual Forbes Field ballpark, effecting a visual verisimilitude the latter film lacks. In addition, 'Angels' sports cameos from both the sports and entertainment worlds including brief interviews with such 'luminaries' as Joe DiMaggio and Bing Crosby.

It's revealed at the end of the film that the angels actually are famous deceased ballplayers such as Babe Ruth and Christy Matthewson. It would have been nice if we could have actually seen the angels and the story would have been enhanced if they were given some kind of personality. Somehow, when we do hear the angel's off screen voice, those scenes don't work precisely because there's nothing happening that's visually interesting.

A good film needs to have both a strong internal and external arc. Unfortunately, there are no twists and turns once Guffy 'sees the light'. Couple that with an antagonist who has no charm, a protagonist who early on is just as surly and a storyline that rather makes an unconvincing case for the ascendancy of religion (i.e. spirituality) in modern life, Angels in the Outfield ends up failing on both counts.

Baseball is hardly the type of arena which should be equated with the world of the spirit. Despite also being a fantasy, 'It Happens Every Spring' has no illusions about the rough and tumble world of our national pastime. Why not catch it instead of the sentimental 'Angels in the Outfield'?",1288396800,,5814,4.834170854271357

Why don't they do that in all those FOX TV shows? The film is also filled with cameos, and the performances seem unforced and effortless.

The only reason I gave this film a chance was because of Leonard Maltin's three star review in his movie guide, in which he remarks, ""Amusing cameos from the worlds of baseball and show business."" The 1994 remake he calls ""a satisfactory entertainment for kids,"" but notes, ""the original was better"".

Paul Douglas is the short-tempered and foul-mouth manager of a downhill baseball team that hits bottom.  The movie has an interesting audio effect to show the manager firing a volley of hot words.  It was a tactfully humorous censorship used in the day!

The angel, head of the Heavenly Choir 9 baseball team, strikes a bargain with the manager.  Angelic help to win some games for the team if the manager cleans up his act.

This 1951 version is superior, however.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are the losingest team in American sports history. As of late 2009, they've finished under .500 for 17 straight seasons. In 1951 (the year this film was released) their won-lost record was a dismal 64-90. No wonder then that this tale of angelic intervention was so popular, especially in the Steel City!

Here, Miss Leigh plays a girl reporter who blames the Pirates' dismal luck on their caustic manager Paul Douglas. When foul-mouthed Douglas starts hearing a divine voice (Whitmore) he vows to change his nasty ways if it will help the team. Sure enough, Pittsburgh goes on a winning streak! An orphan girl (and diehard Pirates fan) claims she can see angels on the field actively helping her team out. In fact, these spirits are deceased all-star players whose assistance may abruptly end if Douglas can't live up to his word.

Fans of baseball history will love this picture for several reasons: it's filmed at old Forbes Field, there's game footage plus cameos of Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner (who slugs a homer) and Ty Cobb (considered by many the greatest baseballer of all time). Also here is Bing Crosby (he owned 15% of the team), songwriter Harry Ruby, Barbara Billingsley (as a hatcheck girl) and Peter Graves (radio announcer). Ed Wood fave Tor Johnson is seen as a wrestler on TV.

He's a feral cat that through inheritance becomes team owner/mascot of the Brooklyn franchise. Rhubarb's presence at games proves a lucky charm for the Brooklyns.

Old one was available from Amazon market place for a good price and I'm so happy to have bought it. It was just as touching as I remembered. Had a tear at the scene about the pitcher. I won't say more. Rated G, you can watch this with your kids, especially your Little League'ers. Touching and well done, on a par with Miracle on 34th Street.

568047,4,6303117856,"This movie was nothing special, but it was a nice film, and certainly better than the terrible Disney re-make in 1994.

The baseball scenes were pretty good and they should have stayed with more of them. They had footage from real-life Pittsburgh Pirates games and that helped make it look more genuine than most sports films that Hollywood made back in the 1940s. Paul Douglas was pretty funny, especially when he started ""swearing,"" mixing his sentences together so you couldn't understand anything he said.

The little girl in the movie, ""Bridget White,"" (Donna Corcoran) was a cute, sweet little thing. She lives in an orphanage run by nuns (Spring Byington and Ellen Corby are featured). It's interesting to note that all the pro-religious scenes in here were deleted in the 1994 Disney version.

The villain of this movie turns out to be the baseball announcer, of all things. Keenan Wynn plays the role so effectively you want to reach through the television and punch this guy out!

I'm glad this finally made it to DVD (in 2007) and it's recommended for those who like an old-fashioned, nice story.",1232236800,,1107,4.872340425531915
568048,5,6303117856,"'Guffy' McGovern's the roughest guy in baseball and he manages the worst team in baseball, the Pittsburgh Pirates (many actual scenes from the old Forbes Field). When the local paper assigns the Home Economics reporter (Janet Leigh) to cover the Pirates to try and find a different angle since they're losing all the time and nobody is following the team, she confronts McGovern about his attitude and he replies, 'Dogs have fleas, managers have sportswriters'. After being thrown out of a game for the umpteenth time, 'Guffy' can't find his pin and goes to look for it on the field after the game. It is there sitting on 2nd base under the stars he encounters an angel and his life is changed. No more bad guy. Amazingly the team's fortunes start to change, also. It becomes even more mysterious when Janet Leigh writes an article about a young, orphan girl who has been praying for the team. 'Guffy' wants to find this girl but Leigh won't reveal who she is. He tracks her to the orphanage and in one of the most poignant scenes in the film tells the Sister in charge that he's 'looking for a little girl'. The Sister rushes into the classroom and announces to the classroom full of 8 year old girls that a man is here who is 'looking for a little girl'. One little girl wearing thick glasses quickly takes them off and hides them, telling her friend, 'people looking to adopt don't like children with glasses'. Your heart goes out as you wonder how many times she has had her hopes up that the next person 'looking for a little girl' would pick her. It's wonderful family film with enough baseball for real fans. It has cameo appearances by Ty Cobb, Joe Dimaggio and Bing Cosby, who was part owner of the Pirates at that time. Conspicuous by their absence, there are no African-American players in the Major Leagues at that time. Dwight Eisenhower called it his favorite movie. Enjoy!!

568050,5,6303117856,"Angels In The Outfield is one of the more under-rated baseball films, and most people think of the later remake rather than this gem from 1950. Gruff character actor Paul Douglas plays the manager of the hapless Pittsburgh Pirates(not far off the mark), with a young Janet Leigh as a journalist covering the team.

568052,4,6303117856,"To someone not in the least bit sports minded and with no idea at all of the rules of baseball, this was a super lighthearted and entertaining film with plenty of the ""feel good"" factor.  Sentimental yes, but never dissolving into ""mush"".  The faultless portrayal by the wonderful Paul Douglas of Guffie McGovern, the foul mouthed and permanently frustrated coach of the hapless Pittsburgh Pirates, who suddenly hears angel voices, apparently despatched to him on the prayers of a small orphan girl, is a joy.  Janet Leigh is excellently cast as the household hints columnist  on the local newspaper, who finds herself catapulted into reporting on the luckless games of the Pirates and gradually becoming more and more involved in the team and, of course, McGovern.  The story moves forward apace, and as the fortunes of the Pirates, with angelic help are turned around, the three characters of Douglas, Leigh and the little orphan girl also begin to be brought together, .  Excellent support from Keenan Wynn and Spring Byington, with a personal appearance by the great Joe Di Maggio.

Good all round entertainment!",1176163200,5,1116,5.032608695652174

Paul Douglas didn't get to have many big roles sadly, so it is great to see him in this. He is like a live action version of Fred Flintstone.

Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. A burnable M-Disc will last 100s of years.
