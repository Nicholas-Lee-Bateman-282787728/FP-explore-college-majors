8409330,5,B003YIN4DU,"For those who don't know, these ""Feature"" packs are DVD sets that WWE released to Wal-Mart stores at a very low price.  However the reason the price is so low is because your not getting the complete DVD sets that you would have gotten on their normal release but only getting the first disc which contains the documentry & a small amount of bonus features so take that into concideration that you aren't getting the entire 2-3 disc sets as they were originally released but only the first disc containing the documenty & a small amount of extras.

Shawn Michaels: Heartbreak & Triumph
The documentry kicks off talking about Shawn growing up on an air force base & becoming a wrestling fan at age 12 to the point where he started doing Ric Flair promos & wrestling in his pool.

Who's idea it was for the WrestleMania 12 Ironman match along with how Shawn trained for it is talked about next before they go into detail about how Shawn was very bitter & heavily opinionated despite being the champion at the time. A very interesting part was Shawn, Triple H, and Vince giving their sides of the story behind the infamous ""curtain call"" in Madison Square Garden.

Matches Include:
Tables Match: Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz - This was the first tables match in WWF history. Man, did these two put on a show here as both teams did a great showing & with the way these teams were put through those tables...it was something to see at the time. Look out for Jeff Hardy, as usual, being a daredevil at the end.
Royal Rumble '00

Jeff Hardy vs. Intercontinental Champion Triple H - The match went non-stop as Hardy was just using his quick ""daredevil"" offense in the opening minutes while Triple H was real intense throughout the match as well with the suprize being that Jeff Hardy winning the Intercontinental Title.
SmackDown! Apr. 01
(Also available on the ""WWF Action"", ""History Of Intercontinental Championship"", ""SmackDown: 10 Year Anniversary"")

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro - This cage match was similar to the Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart match in which they didn't turn it into a bloody massacre but did good wrestling inside the cage. If you've seen their previous matches, you know this will not disappoint but the ending was something unique for a cage match.
New Years Revolution '07

World Tag Team Champions The Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch - A rematch from the previous month at Backlash with J.B.L. & Michael Cole calling the match for some reason (since Matt's the only one on SmackDown). This tag match & storyline itself was very similar ot the Eddie Guerrero/Batista one from back in 2005 where the heels were trying to play by the rules & not cheat. It was a good tag team match but to me, was a step down from their Backlash match the previous month. Besides seeing Trevor Murdock pull off the Canadian Destroyer, there really wasn't anything memorable here eventhough it was a solid contest. This was the match of the night for that PPV.
Judgment Day '07

Winner gets WWE Championship Title Shot At Royal Rumble: Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H - This was all about Triple H making Jeff Hardy step his game up as the beginning had Hardy hold back a punch before Triple H slapped him & yelled for Hardy to ""FIGHT ME!"" before Hardy returned the slap to Triple H. From here, they went back & forth with each other with Triple H getting more aggressive every time it looked like Hardy would make a comeback. Great match that served it's purpose in elevating Hardy to the main event.
Armageddon '07
(Also available on ""Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules"")

Other matches include two matches with Jeff Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin & a steel cage match vs. Umaga. Other DVD Extras include the Hardy's talking about their pet dogs and a music video to Jeff Hardy's own song ""Old Grow."" Hidden extras include Jeff's ultimate goal for his alumnimummy creations & a story behind how Jeff wrecked his studio.

In the end, Shawn's documentry on his career & life is worth the money alone while I felt Jeff's documentry (which was under an hour) was just there & didn't really do anything for me as it focused more on his life outside of wrestling than anything else but what Jeff's lacked in the documentry was made up for by the matches on his disc.  Now there are two different ways to look at this set in that if your just looking for the documentries than I suggest you get this however if your want more than just the documentries (like how Jeff's set comes with Matt's documentry & more bonus matches while Shawn's is 2 extra disc full of matches & hidden extras) then I would pass on this & get the complete sets.",1284336000,2,10595,4.632783395423098
