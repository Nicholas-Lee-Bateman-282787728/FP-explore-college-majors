5723706,5,B00CJ5DEP2,This movie kept the whole family captivated as we watched.  My 3 year old twin niece and nephew loved it.,1387756800,2,105,4.25
5723707,5,B00CJ5DEP2,Great movie that you don't have to worry about bad laugh and violence! My son watches this at least 2 x a week and picture and sound quality is as new as when we first got it over a year ago!,1386460800,,191,3.682926829268293
5723708,5,B00CJ5DEP2,Always keeps the kids happy. Very much like the quality of the old MGM shorts of the 40's/50's which in those days cost a fair bit to do.,1379462400,,137,3.9285714285714284
5723709,4,B00CJ5DEP2,"I thought I knew what this movie would be about. I mean, what person doesn't know who Tom and Jerry and their story are? Lady owns a mouse and a cat, and these two adorable creatures fight nonstop with each other, until they get in a big problem, right? Wrong! ""Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure original movie"" is a fun and adorable adventure for the whole family!

The moment I turned on my TV to watch this move, I could see this would be a unique Tom and Jerry film. It has, of course - comedy, adventure, thrilling action and many more things all in one film! This movie surprises you with a story of a mouse and a cat who at the end are best friends despite their differences!

The fun story begins when a young man wants to open an amusement park. The day it opens he meets a girl and falls in love with her. Years later the park gets run down and there's only a cat, a mouse and a cow left. The man passed away and left behind his son and wife. A man is going to destroy the park but instead, something very surprising happens when Jack, the son, goes to sell the cow.

The movie is very entertaining and funny. The voice actors do a fantastic job of making you relate to their characters. If there is one thing to criticize is the fact that this animated movie feels a little rushed. This story is very different from the usual Tom and Jerry movies and definitely brings fresh air into this unique relationship between a mouse and a cat.

My favorite scene is when the animals realize that they are losing their home and Jack sings a song to make them feel better. It's very catchy, and fun!

Since this film is very child friendly and educational, I recommend it for ages 3 to 18. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because it is a tiny bit rushed and may be a bit confusing for younger kids because of that.

5723711,5,B00CJ5DEP2,"I love watching Tom and Jerry. We know cats hate mice, and the same about mice. But Tom and Jerry make it very come to life and silly. You can't help but laugh.",1376524800,,160,3.878787878787879
5723712,5,B00CJ5DEP2,"I just recently introduced my kids to the original Tom and Jerry show and they were really looking forward to watching their new movie Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure!

They were hooked from their first watch and asked to see it over and over again! I was curious to see what a modern day Tom and Jerry would be like and basically, they are exactly the same! I was worried they could change them to bring them up to date but while the picture is better, the sound effects, antics and appearance of the beloved cat and mouse remain unchanged.

I loved the homage to classic fairy tales that I grew up on such as Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, Jack and the Beanstalk and The Cow Jumped Over the Moon. My kids actually haven't heard a lot of these stories so they didn't necessarily get all of the history of the movie but they still loved it nonetheless.

I think what made this movie more relatable for them than the original show was the little boy Jack that starred in it as well as all the other human characters that talked and interacted with each other more than Tom and Jerry. They were as quiet as usual but as love able and silly as ever.

Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure is a fun movie that parents will enjoy because of all the original fairy tale references and kids will love for it's magic and comedy.",1375660800,6,1310,4.33469387755102

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, Tom and Jerry have remained one of the most popular cartoon duos for over seventy years. Warner Bros. has done a good job of keeping this franchise alive and fresh with new original movies, even now and then. Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie is a new animated adaptation of classic story Jack and the Beanstalk. It features some great voice talents including Tom Wilson, Garrison Keillor, Paul Reubens, Grey Delisle and Jacob Bertran. If you are a fan of Tom and Jerry, this is a definite must purchase. It is very clever, funny and great for the whole family!

The Tom and Jerry brand continues to be a lucrative franchise for Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Whether made up of new or repackaged material, the titles keep on coming. Falling into the former category is the all-new Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie which is available in the combination of Blu-ray + DVD + ULTRAVIOLET, in other words a Combo Pack for your viewing delight. Lately there seems to be a glut of updated retellings of fairy tales, including Jack and the Beanstalk and also in Warner Home Video recent feature Jack the Giant Slayer. Now, the classic cat-and-mouse adversaries have been grafted on to a new version of the tale.

Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie will undoubtedly appeal most strongly to the very youngest of viewers. The surprisingly melancholic opening features the dulcet tones of narrator Garrison Keillor explaining the downfall of the Storybook Town theme park. Following its creators untimely passing, the park fell into disrepair. Widow Violet and her son Jack do their best to keep it operational, but the customers aren't there. Their main attraction, in fact, is the trio of animals still residing on the grounds: Tom, Jerry, and a cow named Hermione. Mr. Bigley shows up to announce hes acquired the parks mortgage and plans to demolish it the next morning. Unless Violet and Jack can come up with enough cash to buy the park back or otherwise it is history for everyone.

As a Tom and Jerry vehicle, Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie falls slightly short on gags. Aside from some typically cartoonish antagonism early on, they are both a little too friendly and comfortable around each other. I like Tom much better when hes mean and snarling. After Jack trades Hermione to Farmer ODell (also voiced by Garrison Keillor) for some magic beans, Tom and Jerry essentially become supporting characters. The duo accompanies Jack to a real version of Storybook Town after the beans sprout sky-high vines overnight. Cameos by classic cartoon characters pepper the land of Ginormous the giant, including Spike and Tyke, Tuffy the Mouse, Droopy Dog, and Screwy Squirrel (the latter voiced by Paul Reubens, aka Pee-wee Herman). As Jack takes on Ginormous, Tom and Jerry are mainly along for the ride. It is not only a very much family friendly entertainment, but is fun for all ages.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video delivered this animated feature in a nice combo pack including a Blu-ray + DVD + ULTRAVIOLET digital copy. A truly excellent 1080p encoded image transfer with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 it looks totally fantastic, as it has with past Tom and Jerry feature film releases. Black levels are not quite as deep as they could be either, but such things appear to trace back to the original source and animation, nothing more. Line art is also sharp and refined, with only a hint of intermittent aliasing, and banding is the only thing that undermines the integrity of the otherwise pristine image. So while Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie isn't the most striking original animated film the studio has released, but still enjoyable to watch.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video solidly mixed 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track is included. A lush amount of ambience is mixed into the surround channels while directional panning through the sound field is judiciously handled. Dynamic range is natural, with a lot of breathing room offered and also a solid low end for the numerous sound effects. Effects sound very good and the rear speaks get involved when necessary.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie sadly doesn't include any special features.

Finally, Tom and Jerrys Giant Adventure: Original Movie is a glorious hour of fun filled comedy frolics that should ably hold the attention of its target audiences. However, long-time Tom and Jerry fans may wonder why theres not more the fighting, chasing, and general struggle between the title characters. Parents and kids alike will be pleased with this feel-good, fun adventure. There are lots of classic Tom and Jerry moments early on, but truth be told, Warner Bros. has eased up a lot on much of the violence that once was a big part of the Tom and Jerry cartoons. So overall I really enjoyed this wonderful cartoon, as it has a lot going for it and lots of typical Tom and Jerry action to keep you enjoying this cartoon, as I thought I might not like it like very much compared to the original Tom Jerry M-G-M Cartoons, but I loved it so much and is well worth purchasing, plus I am now keen to get the other Warner Bros. Tom and Jerry Animation Blu-ray discs on offer and so pleased I have now added this to my Warner Home Video Blu-ray Collection and will enjoy viewing this brilliant cartoon, with many viewings. Highly Recommended!

This ""newer"" version of the classic cartoon Tom and Jerry conveys blatant sexuality to our children through scantily clad characters.  To included ""cartoon"" sexuality like this in the 1950s would have been scandalous...now it's common place.  We were shocked that our small children would be exposed to ""ferries"" so scantily clad that all but the most private parts of their bodies were left exposed.  Disgusting.
