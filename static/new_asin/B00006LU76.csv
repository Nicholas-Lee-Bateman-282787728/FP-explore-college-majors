7972207,5,B00006LU76,I have been searching for an informative Dvd on Wing Chun basics and now I have found it.  This is some of the best footage that I have seen of this style.,1089763200,,155,3.84375
7972208,5,B00006LU76,"If all the martial arts DVDs I buy were as informative as this one, It would
be a perfect world. The footage is historic, so for overall quality, I give
it a 4.",1089158400,2,160,3.878787878787879
7972209,1,B00006LU76,"The DVD cover looked good online but it is nothing more than a inkjet printed cover.  Poor audio.  No structure on topics covered.  Nothing more than a home video with the Master and his students demonstrating some aspects of wing chun. Could be better but for now really poor show.  For the price I paid for it, simply not worth the money.",1055376000,13,340,4.435483870967742
7972210,1,B00006LU76,"First off. This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD, so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players.
That being said, this is DVD rip of a VHS master. It's ok, it's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun. Not very good in the details. No chapter stops. I believe it's only 30 minutes long.
I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD.",1049068800,10,361,4.246376811594203
