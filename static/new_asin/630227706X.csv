Its definately Dry Humor, and does a comedy exploration of the Church, how they pick the pope (all the political menuvering), the rumored corruption within the church, and how a mistake can be heavanly ordained.",1229385600,2,278,4.673469387755102

7824194,4,630227706X,"Here's a fun little sleeper. A sly black comedy for those who aren't too impressed with Catholicism. I'm pretty darn impressed with the screenwriting and the excellent timing of the director. The movie is so well cast that instead praising the great performances of the actors, I should simply praise the casting director.

Its satirical jabs at the Vatican are goofy without being too much so or too heavy handed. The movie examines the old predictable theme of how the nice innocent original concept of Christianity has fallen prey to so much corruption through the centuries by Catholicism. But this tired old theme still succeeds in the capable hands of Richardson and his production crew.

This forgotten movie that never made it to DVD can still give you plenty of knowing snickers and chuckles. At the price it's being sold here at Amazon, it's well worth it. If you ever stumble upon it when browsing at your local video store, don't pass it up!",1156032000,5,953,4.804878048780488
7824195,5,630227706X,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT, JUST WONDERFUL, I JUST WISH THOSE BOZOS IN CHARGE WOULD TRANSFER IT TO DVD AND STOP KEEPING FILM HISTORY IN THE VIDEO SECTION OR THE 8 TRACK SECTION.

GUITAR DIETY JEFF BECK PLAYS THE GUITAR FOR THE PICKIN PADRE AND EVEN HAS A CAMIO AS A LETTER CARRYIER ON A BYCICLE DELIVERING A LETTER TO PALO FROM THE NEW POPE.

VERY FUNNY, ONLY BAD PART IS THE CHEEP WIG HIS SON IN THE MOVIE WEARS.

VIDEO TO DVD, VIDEO TO DVD, VIDEO TO DVD NOW NOW SIS BOOM BAH!",1095724800,9,470,4.032258064516129
7824196,4,630227706X,This movie is not for the average american it is british dry humor.  Being a huge monty python and faulty towers fan I found this movie a riot. Others find this movie dull I think they just didn't get the hummor.,945907200,9,212,4.170731707317073
