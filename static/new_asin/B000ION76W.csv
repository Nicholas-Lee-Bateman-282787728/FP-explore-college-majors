It is for the dedicated enthusiast who has patience to read the subtitles or for the hard of hearing who needs to.  we prefer colorized.  otherwise, it is a great collection.",1361836800,,247,4.568181818181818

For those who aren't familiar with Hideshi Hino, He's a cult hit favorite in the Japanese horror manga scene. He's famous for drawing manga with strange and horrific themes, while keeping a cute, and somewhat comical, child-like appearance.

These movies are very low budget films, each done by a different director, and taking place in a different Hino Horror based world. The stories don't always go along with the manga, but I think that it works out well enough.

These are nice movies as a set, Ranging from the serious and sad zoruko's disease, and Living dead girl, to the over the top Boy from hell, and confusing death train. I was sad to see that in my version (it was probably just a glitch) the audio cuts out half way through Doll cemetery.
Other than that Defenately worth it, as long as you know these aren't oscar winning performances, and you don't expect much of a coherent story-line.  Don't pay $50 for it though, I'd recommend it  anywhere from $25 and lower. that's about worth it. ^_^",1273708800,2,1095,4.51010101010101
8147062,4,B000ION76W,"Hideshi Hino's Theater of Horror (Various directors, 2004)

Those who are familiar with Hideshi Hino's groundbreaking films in the Guinea Pig series-- Flower of Flesh and Blood is one of those few releases that can truly be said to have forever changed the face of film as we know it today-- are going to be somewhat surprised, and probably let down, by the six short movies in the Hideshi Hino's Theater of Horror box. Hino steps out from behind the cameras and lets other directors work with his world-famous manga, and the result looks more like a low-budget TV series than the ultra-gory Guinea Pig films.

The ultimate result of this, however, is to point out even more starkly the differences between the American and Japanese cultures of film. The six films here are almost alarmingly low-budget, the kind of thing that in America would be relegated to independent channels at 2:30 on Saturday morning, and would have the appropriate quality. In these six films, however, the bargain-basement quality of the filming, and the microbudget special effects, couch rich, complex scripts with interesting characters and interesting situations in which they can perform. Some of the films are straightforward morality plays of the type one expects from Hino manga (assuming, of course, one has read Hino manga), while others are labyrinthine pieces of ambiguity (Death Train stands out here, as diffuse as any four-hour Soviet epic, but concentrated and horrific). None of them requires a great amount of time or attention, stretching from forty-three to sixty-one minutes each, but while each is on the screen, it will demand both from you.

All in all, a fine little box, both less and more than I was expecting. I'll be watching these almost as much as I watch Hino's contributions to the Guinea Pig series. *** ",1169683200,6,1815,4.98019801980198
