2473626,5,B000CSTKIS,"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from this film, but it really won me over. The characters might have been a little over-stated, but all in all an all too real look into the goings-on behind the scenes of what is supposed to be a Kid's Activity. I looked at some of the cars that were raced in the finals and it reminded me of some of the cars I saw at my own Pine Wood Derby as a kid and I know now, as I and the Scout Leaders did then, that the kid never lifted a finger in the construction process. But, oh well, que so-what, so-what. I still enjoyed this little film emensely, although I wish that Pat Morita had been in it more, he's one of my favorite character actors, and losing him last year was a real loss to entertainment as a whole. And the films exterior scenes were all filmed in my home town of St. George, Utah, so of coarse I'm going to like it for that reason alone, but the rest of the film is more than worth while too. Recommended!",1155254400,10,965,4.03125
2473627,5,B000CSTKIS,A must see for boy scouts and their fathers.  Very funny for the whole family.,1141948800,14,78,4.2
2473628,4,B000CSTKIS,"Since I'm familiar with the Boy Scout subculture of adult volunteers being more enthusiastic than their own boys in scouting, I found many of the jokes right on target. It is a strange subculture too for anyone who is not a part of it or is new to scouting.

While it played on only three screens in metro Atlanta during its run, and didn't even gross a million dollars nationally, I knew it was a direct-to-DVD type of film and didn't expect it to amount to much. However, I found the film to be much funnier than expected. It is essentially a situational comedy that you find in 30 minute installments on network television, but in a movie length 90 minutes. The actors and plot are sitcom-esque, which isn't bad and actually quite entertaining. I laughed more than I expected to and the story went in a direction I didn't expect.

Basically, the plot is that one man feels inadequate ever since childhood when a newcomer displaced him from winning all childhood contests. The competition continues into adulthood when inexplicably, the three friends and the interloper all live on the same cul-de-sac. When their sons receive pinewood derby kits, the dads all have plans of their own to win once and for all. Comedic farce ensues. If you can stand sitcom-type humor, this movie will delightfully entertain you and it is the kind of film parents can watch with their children without embarrassing profanity or sex scenes. The only misadvertisement I saw in this film is that Pat ""Miyagi"" Morita is given a bigger billing than his cameo role. That's a shame. He should have had a bigger part for his final film.

Anyone who has ever competed in the pinewood derby as a cub scout will probably enjoy this film as a nostalgic and funny tribute to the male competitive gene. I remember my own experience in how serious other boys took this race. For me, it was just fun to design my own car and see how it raced...but for others, winning is the only thing. This movie resolves itself in a very good way, making this film much better than I expected it to be.",1141776000,25,2056,4.581521739130435
2473629,5,B000CSTKIS,"Fun for the whole family, especially if there's a scouter on board! I thought it was going to be cheesy/second rate...but it's not! This is a quality built movie with a great cast and could easily have been a theater hit. All kids will enjoy this, not just for scouters! Zoom this baby right in to your cart, it's worth it!

2473632,5,B000CSTKIS,As a mom with a son in scouts and a husband with a need for speed this movie hit close to home.  It is a must see for anyone who has ever had to build a pinewood derby car for or with their cub scout.  I laughed my way through the entire movie.,1139270400,2,244,3.5849056603773586
2473633,4,B000CSTKIS,"It was much better than I thought it would be.  It is about 3 dads who go overboard  trying to develop the winning pinewood derby car.  There aim is two fold, to win and especially to beat Ace Montana (""the best name in the world"")

2473728,3,B000CSTKIS,"Okay, I guess. It was a very predictable story, reasonably funny, but not side-splitting. I mainly watched it to start with because I've been involved in Scout Leading for some years now, so I thought I'd see how it was being represented. Believe it or not, I've seen parents behave in similar manners as the ones in this movie for ""their son's race"". Maybe that's what made it not as funny to me.",1441929600,,397,4.4520547945205475

2473776,5,B000CSTKIS,"One of those movies the kids watch over and over.  It helps if you have seen a Pinewood Derby race so you recognize how much work they put into building their own tracks and cars.

Surprisingly well acted and the dialog is excellent.  I thought the soundtrack and editing were great, too. We  have seen Greg Germann in many other movies, as well as Lauren Holly. I'm surprised I haven't seen more of these other actors.

I could go on and on and dissect the plot, theme, etc., but there is no need. It is what it is, a non-serious take on the Pinewood Derby. I laughed out loud which doesn't happen often in movies.",1429315200,,615,4.3130434782608695

I had my 8th graders make a pinewood car for science enrichment class and I wish I would of had this to show them how intense some parents are. Good clean movie that can be shown to children.

This movie entertains that idea with high levels of laughter,  showing us that kids can be creative if we'll just give them the chance. The Disney movie ""The Snowball Express"" assimilates this same idea. Give a kid a chance and watch the grown-up in them be unleashed.",1402272000,,442,4.5125

We watch it several times a year, but especially right before our Pack's Pinewood Derby race; it gets them race ready, so to speak!  If you want a movie that has a great cast, family friendly action, clean jokes, and lots of fun, then this is your movie!  This is also a great main movie feature for a Cub Scout overnighter the month before Pinewood Derby (in December) and give out to the boys their Pinewood Derby kits from Santa who then makes a special trip to your overnighter event so the boys can start getting ready for the next month's race day event early!

2473846,3,B000CSTKIS,"I watched this on Netflix with my 9.5 yo son a few weeks ago, before his third derby, and I thought he got the point quite well, though he thought it was WAY over the top.  Our joke to each other while building our derby cars this year was, ""Are you ready to get 'Down and Derby'? - No, let's NOT get Down and Derby."".  And that was my key issue with the movie - where ""Follow me, boys!"" painted with subtle strokes, this one drove home the point with a 9 pound hammer.  It lost the plot in the sheer ridiculousness of the antics of the fathers, and then the sons, and then the mothers and on and on until it became comedy for comedy's sake.  Don't get me wrong, there were some painfully funny moments, especially if you've ever dealt with an overly competitive dad or two as a Cub Scout volunteer, but it was just too much to really appeal to Cub Scouts or their parent's better natures when teaching lessons about competition, which I genuinely think it was trying to do.  Too bad, it had the right ingredients.",1395619200,,1014,4.260416666666667

I have a son who is a Wolf Cub now.  I was able to relate how parents (Dads) work on the Pinewood Derby, rather than let their sons do the work.

2473858,5,B000CSTKIS,"I didn't think my boys aged 2 and 5 would like this show, but they did.  It starts out with 2 boys running, so maybe that's why.  My other children love it too.  7, 11, 13.  The show had very funny adult humor (but not dirty humor)---humor usually surrounding competition.

CONS:  One of the Mom's does dress mildly suggestively, but not so revealing that I would complain that we need to shut the show off.

I think there is a use of the word ""D...""  So very mild.

It's been a while and that's all I can remember that could be offensive.

I just love the obsession of the men and the over the top competition.",1376870400,,611,4.189655172413793
2473859,4,B000CSTKIS,"Watched this film it was OK the boys who watched with me seemed to be OK with it but as soon as the film was over they were done with it. There was not much additional conversation over it like they had with other movies we have watched but works for a filler at a lock-in event or an ourdoor movie for camping the rating level is sufficient. It does work with a pinwood derby event if you have a party after the races, and the boys need an extra time filler.

The desciption of the movie itself on it's packaging is incorrect.  This is NO FAULT of this company and their service, price and shipping was good.  The movie says that the boys come together in the end and find the true meaning of Scouting and Derbies.  This is NOT true.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!  The Dad's are out of control, the kids come together to swindle them and get money out of them and use it to their advantage.  In the end one kid makes a great car and I guess learns the true meaning but really none of that journey is shown.  My kids (4.5 & 6.5) did find parts of this hilarious but I don't know that I'd show it to them again.  I would NOT feel comfortable showing this to my den.  I don't think it really shows what's great about scouting as much as how out of line grown ups can be.

For the rest of you, who might not be young boy scouts, you can get a kick out this movie as well.  My husband, my tween daughter, my preschooler, my scout, and myself --- we all laugh every time we see the show.  You pick up some new hilarity every time.

On the back of the movie there's a parent guide with questions to ask the family about the movie. Our family goes through them after the movie it's always a nice way to wrap up our family time.

Now about the movie...if your boys old and young have ever been in Scouts than this will be really familiar and bring back loads of good memories.

The actors are great the story keeps on track. My kids really liked it! In fact the day after we watched it they wanted to watch it again!

It's not just the type of movie kids would enjoy it's a wholesome comedy that adults will enjoy as well.

Another nice thing is it's about 89 minutes long so it's just the right length to fit in on a weeknight after dinner so the kids can still get to bed on time!",1263340800,3,859,4.150602409638554

2473905,3,B000CSTKIS,"This was obviously a low-budget movie and it seemed almost as if the story was written with budgetary limitations in mind. That is, it's almost as if the director and writers worked hard to come up with a plot and set of circumstances that would allow the filming of the movie to be convenient and inexpensive. If this was the case, then they did a reasonably good job of working within their budgetary constraints because the movie is somewhat entertaining and reasonably well produced. However, a major flaw of the movie is that the fathers become unrealistically involved in a Pinewood Derby competition and pretty much squeeze their kids out of the contest and out of the movie. This plot twist was probably included mostly as a way to expedite the filming of the movie. That is, it is quicker and easier to film scenes with adults than with children and so it seems that the director took a bit of a short cut here. In many ways this movie is similar to ""Kicking and Screaming"" in this way. The key difference is that while the adult actors in ""Kicking and Screaming"" were able to compensate for this deficiency, the actors in ""Down and Derby"" would have been better suited to the role of supporting a plot that emphasized the kids a bit more! That's not to say that the adults lacked talent, but their performances (and the script they were supplied with) weren't enough to make up for the awkward nature of the story. All that being said, I still rate this movie at three stars!",1228780800,,1485,4.5655430711610485

My son, who is a Webelo Scout this year, though it was awesome, especially as we just had our own Pinewood Derby race last week!

the plot

Back when they were just kids, Phil Davis was the best athlete in town - that is until Ace Montana moves into the neighborhood.  Ace wins every 1st place trophy ever since, and this has Phil and his two best buds Brady and Big Jimmy green with envy for most of their lives.  Skip ahead to today, and Phil, Brady and Big Jimmy are still best buds, and they still harbor the same resentment towards Ace who completes the cul-de-sac where they all now live.

This summer, the Pinewood Derby rolls into town and now the old competitive rivalry is rearing its ugly head.  Their children were given the tools to make their own small racing car that would compete in the derby, but these over-eager dads take over and their kids end up spending their summer vacation at the Mall and the movies instead of fashioning their own cars.

The competition grows fierce, grown men are cheating by trying to get around the regulations, and others are resorting to breaking into their neighbors houses to try and be aware of what exactly they're up against.  Phil Davis has turned his house upside down racing the cars through the bedroom, and he is in danger of losing his job as he continues to shirk his duties.  His wife Kim even takes their son and leaves him until the night of the derby.

Will all of this cheating pay off?  Does Ace have something sneaky up his sleeve in order to win the derby?  Will Kim divorce Phil because of his recent behavior?  Probably not in the family-friendly film, but if you need to know, rent the video.

the breakdown

I really didn't enjoy this movie at all.  This DVD found its way into my house through my wife who ordered a couple of sackfulls of ""family-friendly"" movies that we could watch together.  I had just asked my 7 year old son, and he told me that he did like it, and would even want to watch it with his friends.  So maybe the kids would like this.  He told me that he liked the ending, and he thought some parts were funny like when Phil and Brady broke into Ace's house, and when Brady used the bathroom, the toilet overflowed.  This scene actually made me roll my eyes at how clich and predictable it seemed to me.  I can see how the kids would find the humor in it, but it kind of turned me off.

Also, I'm not too sure I appreciate the message the movie gives where the so-called good guys are doing despicable things to Ace, all in the name of how life isn't fair when it comes to this guy.  The bad behavior here is carried out without consequence, and what kind of message is that?  Plus, I suppose this is just not my kind of humor.

Every dad living in this cul-de-sac had totally and literally lost their minds.  This comes across unrealistic and annoying at best.  On the other hand, Lauren Holly who plays Kim, wife to Phil, looks stunning every time she's on the screen.  Actually, if it wasn't for the beautiful actress, this dud would have been a total waste of time.

Chances are you probably have never seen this and that's a good thing.  The DVD is however regarded highly by the PTC and the Feature Films for Families websites primarily for its non-offensive content, but the quality of this film is quite meager.  There are scarcely any laughs, it's unrealistic and it sends a poor message to the young uns.  If you are however still interested, I suggest rent it instead of purchasing.  Yet at the price it's going at now. It may be cheaper to buy the DVD and then toss it.
