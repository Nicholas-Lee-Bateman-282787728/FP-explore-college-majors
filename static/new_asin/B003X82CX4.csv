4216007,5,B003X82CX4,"HAND IN HAND is a charming, moving little British drama from 1960 that enjoyed it's greatest popularity in America several years later for it's multiple runs on THE CBS CHILDREN'S FILM FESTIVAL during the late 60's and 70's.  Few kids who saw it during this era ever forgot the movie even if they forgot the film's name, it's one of the most involving dramas ever made for children.

This movie is about Michael, a young Catholic boy, and Rachel, a young Jewish girl, who become the best of friends but whose closeness is threatened by the intolerence of some of the people in their world.  A major breach comes when Michael hears that the Jewish people ""killed Christ"" and both come to believe God Himself is against their friendship but their bond is strong and ultimately each of them dares to visit the other's house of worship.  The duo's adventures include a comic road trip in pursuit of Queen Elizabeth and a harrowing rubber raft ride.

The child stars Loretta Parry and Philip Needs are excellent and there's a wonderful cameo by Dame Sybil Thorndyke as a wealthy matron who befriends them.  This lovely little film is highly recommended for all ages.",1285545600,34,1161,4.7227722772277225

It made such an impression on me that I and two of my siblings sought it out at separate times without consulting each other first.  There is nothing not to like.  The characters are all good, warm people, particularly the dear children about whom the story is told.  In today's world, with all its cynicism, prejudice and intolerance, it is refreshing to watch a simple movie that attacks all of these heady topics in a way that makes you realize how children are free of these vices until someone points them out.  In this story, once the children realize they are different it makes no difference to them.  They love each other unconditionally.  Even better, their feelings about each other are supported by the important adults in their lives.  If you are a parent, please, please, please buy this movie and have your child watch it.

4216068,5,B003X82CX4,"Back in 1961, (long before cable television was something then of an future mainstream) CBS released for the first time on The Children's Film Festival Hour (hosted by Kukla Fran & Ollie) the award winning film Hand In Hand. I was fortunate to watch it when it was rereleased again back in 1965 on the same channel. TV memories (especially early television) are especially magical moments in every child's life and Hand In Hand allows me today to sincerely reminisce after 49 years the true meaning of a bonded and inseparable friendship of two british children:Rachel and Michael. In the film, Michael is a spirited well mannered adventurous lad while Rachel is a darling sweet ""from her bangs to her lady jane shoes"" girl who reside in a suburban town in post war England. After a row of mischevious schoolboys clan together to ""bully"" Rachel, Sir Galahad Michael witnesses her uncertain fate and rescues her from her schoolyard tormentors. A bonding begins at that very moment. Like peas & carrots, (remember Forrest Gump?) Michael and Rachel together as one would share playful activities and do anything possible to keep their friendship intact from personal distractions. An example of this are the religious intolerances between the children's mothers. Because Rachel is jewish, her mum has misgivings about Rachel's bonding with Michael for he is of the Catholic faith. Michael's mum has similar misconceptions regarding Rachel for she is of the jewish faith. After Michael is lectured about the death of Christ from an antisemetic kid, their friendship is threatened. He wrongly accusses Rachel of being a Christ killer. Sadly Rachel is hurt from this accusation. But together they decided to challenge their doubts and fears by attending their houses of worship just to prove themselves regardless of their religious differences that God is one and love is what matters and important. In the end (the climax of the film) as Michael and Rachel decide to go water exploring, he brings along a rubber raft and the two go off on a boating adventure to Africa. From a lake to a unsettling waterfall, the raft capsizes and they land up fighting for their lives in the water. Rachel manages to hold on to a tree limb but is saved by Michael but then soon discovers she has drowned. Again Michael discovers their friendship is again threatened and fears she's dead. Thankfully, inform from the parish priest, she has survived :) and they're the best of pals all over again. This is perhaps a rare and insightful film that showcases and educates the magtitude of human friendship and religious disharmony. A dated but a wonderful and classic film for all ages. I wonder what ever happen to Rachel (Loretta Parry) and Michael (Philip Needs) today. Could it be possible they are married to each other?",1406332800,,2800,4.934322033898305

4216070,3,B003X82CX4,"Excellent storyline, however due to the age of the film, some thinking is outdated..such as it is a ""sin to go into a synagogue"" and the Jews killed Christ""",1393545600,,156,4.413793103448276

4216072,5,B003X82CX4,"I love this movie. Of course it reminds me of my childhood, as my Parochial School showed it at least once a year during my early school years, so I never forgot it. I'm so happy I was able to find it online. This is a story of love, friendship, trust between two young British children growing up in two different religious cultures. One Catholic, one Jewish.

I recommend this as a wonderful family film, to sit down and watch something wholesome and sweet.  This movie keeps your interest throughout. I mean if I remember it from my early childhood, it obviously made an impression on me. Check it out, you won't be sorry.",1383955200,2,625,4.473684210526316

4216074,5,B003X82CX4,"Isn't it nice to see this little gem released to home video after 50-plus years?  Like most reviewers here I saw ""Hand in Hand"" long ago as part of the children's film festival series on TV (thank you, Kukla, Fran, and Ollie!)  and the memories have never left. It's a charmer, telling a poignant tale sweetly and without pretense, a small masterpiece of British cinema from a simpler age.  The two children carry the film like seasoned pros without any pretension or preaching and the values and message imparted are timeless ones of love, loyalty, and tolerance.  Quality stories like this ought to have a wider distribution and profile (what an ideal school movie), but at least this DVD might rescue it from obscurity for an audience that needs it now more than ever.  The DVD quality is very high despite a lack of bonus features (I'm sorry the grown-up actors weren't given a chance to add a commentary track), glorious sharp black and white photography and a snapshot of a departed time of pre-decimal currency, Latin mass,  and leafy English suburbia.  ""Hand in Hand"" deserves every award it ever received and I advise viewers to buy the DVD  while they can, it looks to be going out of print again very soon.

Note: the Amazon editorial review is wrong in implying this is an American movie or an American setting. It is English.

Now if only the equally well-remembered and beloved ""Skinny and Fatty"" from the same series would finally see a home video release!  Anyone out there listening?",1377475200,8,1500,4.730769230769231
4216075,5,B003X82CX4,"This was a movie that impacted my life at a very young age. My husband and I watched it together when it came, and I realized that there was more to it than  I received as a child. In black and white, but still sends the same message.  There is one God, and he loves all of us - Gentiles, Jews, Greeks, etc., and Salvation is available to all.",1373673600,,343,3.9565217391304346
4216076,5,B003X82CX4,"During my own childhood, I can remember seeing this movie.  It resurfaced after my kids were born, showing on after-school and weekend children's film festivals.  It's a sweet tale of religious bigotry and, yes, toleration.

Set in England, two kids decide to buck their upbringing and join forces to build their own little world free of adult interference.  Final scene is a lovely touch.",1370217600,,389,5.03125

4216079,5,B003X82CX4,"Okay, it is SO dated. Early 1960's social issues and film techniques. That said, I love this film. I saw it with my sister and my favorite aunt when it was first released here in the States, and it stayed with me all my life. When I saw it had been released on DVD, I couldn't wait to order it. I was not disappointed. From the great musical theme (again, very '60s), the wonderful way the two children are depicted, the celebration of imagination, and the positive family and social values, it was just a delight for me to watch it again all these years later. Yes, you will have to let yourself travel back in time to a less frenetic, cynical and cinematically sophisticated time, but if you do, you will come away from this film with a truly warm and happy heart.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hand-in-Hand/dp/B003X82CX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hand in Hand</a>",1352505600,,912,5.12751677852349
4216080,5,B003X82CX4,"I vividly remember this movie from the late 1960's, on the CBS Children's International Film Festival with Kuklaa Fran and Ollie.  For decades, the memory of this movie stayed with me, but I could not remember the title or even how it ended.  I even had a strong memory of the voice and accent of the child actress who played Rachel.

In the mid 1990's, I went to my local Public Library, to try to find out the name of this movie.  When I described the movie to the Reference Librarian, she also remembered the movie and many of the scenes but could not come up with title.  She asked two other librarians both of whom also remembered this movie but also could not come up with the name.  All said they found the movie to be very powerful while watching the movie on television, and that it stayed with them for a long time.  Anyway, the librarian posted a question on some listserv, trying to find out the title and she got the answer of ""Hand in Hand"" within 5 minutes.  Unfortunately, at that time it was not released in any format.

This is less than a review, but how I believe this is a gem of a movie that no one knows about.  I watched it for the first time in over 40 years the other day, and found it to be just as memorable and powerful as it was for the first time I watched on television being around 10 years old. Obviously, it is a movie of a certain time and place, but the lessons of prejudice, intolerance, and tolerance are all there and more importantly just as relevant today.

Highly recommended for everyone.",1340668800,9,1532,4.284722222222222

The children are delightful, and the story takes both their imagination and their troubles seriously, without condescension or melodrama. (Plus the kids are clearly loved and cared for, but they have the full run of town & countryside for their adventures, without any expectation of constant adult supervision - unthinkable for seven-year-olds today!

I remember the impact it had on me when I first viewed it as a child in the mid 60's and so I immediately purchased it on AMAZON as soon as it became available.  It was a surreal experience to watch it again, deja vu if you will, as I found myself recalling what the actors were going to say before the lines were actually uttered.  Looking back, it was probably one of the first indications of where my life's journey would take me.  For even as a child, I could appreciate the beauty of a loving relationship where differences in religion could serve as an added dimension of understanding and an opportunity to expand one's horizons.  Now some 50 years later, I look forward in May to my twin son and daughter graduating from college.

4216086,5,B003X82CX4,"""Hand in Hand"" will never be forgotten for those who were fortunate enough to see it during the 1960's and 1970's when it was played often on CBS in several of their children's series. Like others, I've been looking for it for years. Superbly written, beautifully played, most especially by the two children, this story of religous doctrines - and prejudice - separting and dividing people from their true and loving natures has seldom been better rendered in book or film. The only false notes, and they are minor, are struck by the adult actors, who are ""acting,"" while the two lead children are simply ""being."" And the ending, while touching, would have been stronger if the final shot was of the two children, not the adults, but these are minor distractions from a classic story of innocence confronting the harsh, adult world, and trying to make sense of it.  What comes across most strongly is the honestly played love between this boy and girl - both of them talented in singing, in their use of imagination, and in their tender understanding of the world and their willingness to make their love endure, despite the obstacles. Their adventures together, from building a house, hitchhiking to see the Queen (when children could roam free without fear), to sailing to Africa, much of it in thier imagination, are poignantly and honestly rendered. ""Fancy fearing that man,"" the girl says to the boy, remarking on an older man, who they had supposed was nasty, but turns out to be a kind, wise soul. ""Fancy fearing anyone,"" the boy replies.  The lessons of this small masterpiece could not be plainer, but what is ultimately the greatest part of this beautiful film is the tender and strong love of these two special childen.

I plan to play it for my grandchildren and share with others as just one way to demonstrate that we CAN AND SHOULD get along and that the world is made up of so many beautiful and wonderfully diverse people, religions and cultures, which is especially pertinent now during the hopefully short, hate-baiting ""reign"" of the ignorant and repugnant presidick drumpf.",1506902400,,625,4.396551724137931

I knew the story involved bigotry and was worried it would upset my kids or enrage me, but it was presented very well.  I don't know of any other movie that deals with this and the other subtopics quite like this.  I wish there were more.  It is an old movie, 1962, so the fact it addressed the bigotry issue made it ahead of its time.  I admire the writer's choice to show that the Rabbi and Priest had always gotten along.  I like that the kids decided to check for themselves if the rumors were true and went to the ""other"" place of worship.  I can't help but say ""Well Done!""",1505779200,,725,4.240875912408759
8407867,5,B003X82CX4,"Via screenplay writer Diana Morgan,  writer Sidney Harmon, Director Philip Leacock, and the adaptation of Leopold Atlas, a 1961 presentation of a children's tale of tolerance comes to life.
  It begins when one distraught Michael O' Malley (Philip Needs), young lad of Irish Catholic descent who resides in an English village, lamenting about a disastrous incident involving his pretty young best friend, Rachel Mathias(Loretta Parry).
  The children's relationship is initially antagonistic, but it develops over time. They spend time at each other's houses, where we see the amiable Mr. and Mrs. O'Malley (Barry Keegan and Kathleen Byron), and Mr. and Mrs. Mathias(Arnold Diamond and Miriam Karlin) leading their lives amid the company of each their children's friendship.
 One day, while watching a television program featuring Native Americans, they agree to adopt the native American ritual of becoming ""blood siblings"", and as their adventures together continue, they become inseparable. A hitchhiking excursion leads them to tea with one Lady Caroline(Dame Sybil Thorndike), who takes the seven-year-olds to tea at her home.
  Rachel discloses around this time that her family is slated to move soon, much to Michael's dismay.
  A turning point in their relationship takes place when one of Michael's friends reveals his father's resentment towards Jews such as Rachel and her family ""because they killed Christ"", leading Michael to have a hostile confrontation with Rachel that knocks  the young girl for a loop.
  They attend each other's worship services. Rabbi Benjamin(Derek Sydney) presides over the Synagogue service attended by the Matthias Family. Michael joins them, quietly , although somewhat confusedly as he sits in another pew, listening to the Cantor (Martin Lawrence). He touches the sacred scrolls along with those of the congregation, and the worshipper next to him hands him the text of worship, enabling Michael to see the service printed in both Hebrew and English.
  Rachel subsequently accompanies Michael to Mass at his church, celebrated by Father Timothy(John Gregson). She is overwhelmed and curious about the religious statues she sees, but ultimately confides to Michael,""I think your Lady likes me!""
 And why shouldn't She? She, after all, was a nice Jewish Girl Herself!
 Their last adventure has treacherous consequences. But it ends with reassurance, and two religious leaders reinstating common ground of their own, and a hopeful and tranquil note.
  At a time when religious intolerance is again on the upswing, a sweet tale like this one is timely and as priceless as ever!",1498608000,,2617,5.401477832512315
