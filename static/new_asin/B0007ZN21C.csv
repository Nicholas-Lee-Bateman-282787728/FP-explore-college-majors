8054862,5,B0007ZN21C,Bee girls not so great. Incredible 2 headed transplant excellent. recommend that highly but if it comes as a multiple video I would buy it just for having the better movie.,1427932800,,172,4.580645161290323
8054863,3,B0007ZN21C,"Here's a DVD double feature from a minor outfit called CATCOM Home Video that's designed to play like an old TV broadcast or drive-in show. There's two Fleischer cartoons (Superman and Betty Boop) plus vintage TV commercials along with a pair of the silliest pictures that ever escaped from Hollywood's reject warehouse.

Director of THE INCREDIBLE 2-HEADED TRANSPLANT (1971), Anthony M. Lanza was primarily an editor on such classics as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Guitar/dp/B0000ZMH7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Guitar</a>"" (1962) and ""What's Up Front"" (1964). His directorial efforts consist of two other bombs, an Arch Hall scripted thing called ""The Irv Carlson Show"" (1968) and a motorcycle flick, ""The Glory Stompers"" featuring Dennis Hopper, Joel McCrea's kid, Jock Mahoney and Casey Kasem.

But in ""2-Headed Transplant"" we have Bruce Dern's most inglorious screen fiasco. Along for the disaster are Pat Priest (Marilyn on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MUNSTERS/dp/B001DZOCZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MUNSTERS</a>), Kasem again and Berry Kroeger (evil fort commander in Lon Chaney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BATTLES-OF-CHIEF-PONTIAC/dp/B0000AGWN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BATTLES OF CHIEF PONTIAC</a>&nbsp;from 1952).

""Transplant"" is a solid 2.5 stars (out of a possible 10) at imdb and falling fast! Poster blurbs capsulize this cheeser perfectly:
""Two heads crafted on the body of a giant... The most fearsome living force ever created by man.""
""One Wants to Love, One Wants to Kill! Two heads grafted to the body of a giant!""

The second half of this turgid twin-bill, INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS (1973) is only marginally better. Its star, muscle-bound William Smith had a choppered career in biker flicks. He was Adonis in the very last episode of TV's BATMAN, brawled with Clint Eastwood in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ANY-WHICH-WAY-YOU-CAN/dp/B000060MWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN</a>&nbsp;(1980) and was Count Sodom in campy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HELL-COMES-TO-FROGTOWN/dp/B000059PP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HELL COMES TO FROGTOWN</a>&nbsp;(1988).

Smith's co-star, former model Anitra Ford was a showpiece on Bob Barker's original THE PRICE IS RIGHT and had a small but meaty role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LONGEST-YARD/dp/B0007TKHI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LONGEST YARD</a>&nbsp;(1973), with Burt Reynolds.

As for ""Bee Girls,"" Nicholas Meyer's script is every frustrated male teen's wet dream. Here, guys are dropping dead all over Peckham (ahem), CA. from getting worn-out by insatiable women, products of a nearby lab run by Miss Ford.

Can you stand the excitement, fellas?",1268179200,3,2947,7.146814404432133
8054864,3,B0007ZN21C,"Whoever said two-heads were better than one must have written the script for this movie. An interesting contrast of insanity and timidity as our two-headed star provides some of the best (translation: hammy and humorous) B-movie acting this side of ""Urban Menace."" Vegetarians would be offended being exposed to this much pork.

Good thing Casey Kasem had a back-up gig. Boy would I love to see the Farrelly brothers remake this.",1260835200,,429,5.042253521126761
8054865,5,B0007ZN21C,"This motion picture hit theaters on June 1, 1973 starring the gorgeous Former Price is Right Model Anitra Ford as Doctor Susan Harris, William Smith as Agent Neil Agar and Victoria Vetri as Julie Zorn. It's a nice sunny day in a small town called Peckham in Southern California where the cleaning lady is going around cleaning rooms at a local motel. When she opens a motel room door lying on the floor dead is a local scientist from the Brandt Research Laboratory. Enters Agent Neil Agar who was sent to California and this small town to find out what's going on. The deeper Agent Agar investigation goes the more murders he uncovers. Enters Doctor Susan Harris who's another doctor that works at the place Brandt Research Laboratory and she's doing a study on bees. Now Agar has to find out why all the man in this little is dieing and he needs to find out now. Now some thoughts on this picture. I have mixed emotions on grading this picture because theme and the plot was dumb and this picture at the beginning was very slow to develop. William smith was bad in his role as Agent Neil Agar, but he didn't seem to be real interested in shooting this film. I can't even remember Victoria Vetri role as Julie Zorn, that's how bad her acting was. However, the star of this picture and the reason why I bought was Anitra Ford. She was excellent in this movie and her talents were wasted. The scene where she starts ********* in the living room was simply gorgeous. Anitra knew she had a gorgeous body and she knows how to show it off and more. Therefore, even though this movie was a dumb science fiction I give this picture 10 weasel stars and not on the movie but on Anitra Ford.",1218499200,,1680,4.422580645161291
