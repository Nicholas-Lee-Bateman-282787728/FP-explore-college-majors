8088618,2,B000BKVLAC,"I must say that when I ordered this while I did not expect to see a completely alternate take on the Bible and History as it is known, I did very much expect to see a lot more information and less speculation than was on the DVD.

The video was not very entertaining at all; a lot of speculation and guessing and perhaps some of the history of biblical times are subjective anyways.  Whatever you may think, most people can at least agree that at one time there was a man who is known today as Jesus.

So who was Jesus?  What did he do?  He was known as the King of the Jews, though not a Jew himself in faith?  Too many unanswered questions.  I was looking to find out more about Jesus as a Teen, did Jesus ever drink and so on.  What did Jesus actually do and where did he go during that part of the bible that was conveniently left out?  In the video it is explored that perhaps Jesus used that time to travel the world to learn about other Religions and cultures.

However in the DVD there is no solid scientific, theoretical or even Biblical Hard Evidence to support any of the speculative ideas of the travels of Jesus.  Personally I would say it is yes very likely that Jesus did in fact not only travel the Known world but what might have been considered the unknown world at the time.  Why though?  Was Jesus simply traveling to travel?  Did Jesus want to learn as many languages as possible so in turn he could relate to as many people as possible in their own language?
HOWEVER, these ideas and obvious possibilities are simply ignored or vaguely touched and hinted upon in the DVD.

We all know the story of the crucifixion to a certain extent, I guess it depends on your beliefs - but at least most would agree that Jesus did in fact die as a result of being crucified on a cross.

However, since this was the unknown Jesus did perhaps Jesus plan to carry on longer than he did and the will of God contradicted the will of Jesus?

Far too many questions are just ignored.  While I have no regrets about buying the DVD, I can say it was just not done well at all.  Also, this documentary is dated - something I did not take into account when I bought it.  While it may have been released on DVD in 2005, the program is from 1987!  Jesus was far too important to history for such a program to have been done so poorly, even in 1987.  A&E should do a NEW The Unknown Jesus documentary and also release it not just on DVD - but Bluray as well.  Look at the things that were so poorly done in this first attempt and get it right in a new Documentary.

I would say this DVD is a good for those perhaps of different faiths wanting basic information about who Jesus was - but not for anyone who wants more than surface information as the title incorrectly implies.",1359849600,,2769,4.2106261859582546
8088619,2,B000BKVLAC,"This is a polished but run-of-the-mill documentary that slightly titillates by touching on the Jesus-in-India hypothesis and the Jesus-was-married hypothesis. It's decent, and includes John Dominic Crossan and a few other big-name scholars.

But despite the marketing text, this documentary does not discuss the issue, at all, of the hypothesis that Jesus didn't exist, that there was no single historical individual who was the kernel of the Jesus figure. A key to reviewing a work is the question ""Does it achieve its stated goals?"" On that basis, this documentary is poor, because it shirks its own question; it does not address its prominent stated objective of discussing ""Is his existence indisputable?""

If you want a pleasant, intelligent mainstream presentation of Christian origins, this will satisfy, but given the many radical hypotheses that have become popular, this documentary is very tame, by anyone's standards; it's only pseudo-daring. It's designed to make people feel like they're watching coverage of bold and daring hypotheses, while actually just presenting now-routine and domesticated ""alternative"" hypotheses. It's not bad, but it's certainly not daring, as the marketing text promises. For a supposedly ""bold"" treatment, this documentary instead delivers sterling mediocrity.

The back of the DVD box states in bold text, near the top, that the DVD covers: ""What is known about the historicity of Jesus?  Is his existence indisputable?""  The DVD in fact provides no coverage of that question whatsoever.  Blatant false advertising is a serious matter, and this is brazen false advertising in the first degree.  The least that should be done to remedy this false advertising is to comment on the question which the DVD text claims to cover but does not cover, as follows.

All during the DVD, I was looking for the entry of the promised topic of ""What is known about the historicity of Jesus?  Is his existence indisputable?""  The documentary explains that many of the traditions about Jesus, including his visit to England and his youth in India, are likely tradition and metaphor rather than historical fact.  The DVD could have then carried this logic all the way to ask whether all traditions about Jesus are tradition and metaphor rather than historical fact.

In the section of the documentary about the Jesus-in-India hypothesis , the argumentation sets up a vector that points from the status-quo view (Jesus as genius who was the necessary cause starting the Christian movement) to no-historical-Jesus (Jesus as orienting-figure who was invented by the Christian movement).

The argumentation begins by asking where was Jesus during his youth?  And where did he get his unique, unprecedented ideas which no one else had?  The scenario is then considered, of Jesus in India, where he did sitting meditation and learned from the teachings of Buddha.  But then the argument proposes instead that Jesus got his ideas from the Essenes -- the community of the Dead Sea scrolls.  The documentary concludes that Jesus got his ideas natively and locally from within Judaism.

However, if you follow this trajectory of reasoning, from the status-quo scenario (Jesus as genius causing the Christian movement) to the ""native Judaism origins"" scenario (Jesus as representative of counter-imperial ideas already present in Judaism), and then beyond, continuing to move in that same direction of thought, this argumentation ultimately points to the 3rd scenario, that no single individual genius was needed as the origin of these ideas (or the idea-combination that was the Christian movement).  The DVD promised to touch on that third scenario, but did not.

In this scenario that is ultimately pointed to by the documentary's direction of argumentation, Jesus was merely one of many people participating in developing the ideas that were already in the culture and in the air during the era.  In that case, it becomes a plausible and satisfying explanation for various problems and variances in traditions about Jesus, to hypothesize that Jesus was a fabricated orienting-figure who was invented and created by the Christian movement, by the counter-imperial drive that was already in the Jewish culture and in the air during the era, throughout not only the Jewish culture in the Levant (including Palestine), but throughout the general culture across the Roman Empire.

Summarizing the positions implied by the DVD, after adding the position which the DVD's marketing text promises to cover:

Scenario 1: Jesus as unprecedented causal genius -- Jesus was a unique genius who was the necessary cause starting the Christian movement.  The ideas of the Christian movement were entirely new to everyone around Jesus.  Other people in Jesus' culture were not particularly bright or imaginative -- even dullards, compared to Jesus; they had to wait for him with his brand new ideas that no one else had ever thought of before, such as ""be good to your neighbor"".  Jesus had unique, unprecedented ideas which no one else had.  The DVD criticizes this idea.

Scenario 2: Native Judaism origins -- Jesus got his ideas natively and locally from within Judaism.  Jesus was merely one of many people participating in developing the ideas that were already in the culture and in the air during the era.  Jesus was representative of counter-imperial ideas already present in Judaism.  Jesus got his ideas from the Essenes, which was the community of the Dead Sea scrolls.  The DVD advocates this idea.

Scenario 3: No-historical-Jesus -- The Jesus figure was a product of counter-imperial ideas throughout the Roman Empire.  Jesus was an allegorical orienting-figure who was invented by the Christian movement.  Jesus was a fabricated orienting-figure who was invented and created by the Christian movement, by the counter-imperial drive that was already in the Jewish culture and in the air during the era, throughout not only the Jewish culture in the Levant (including Palestine), but throughout the general culture across the Roman Empire.  No single individual genius was needed as the origin of these ideas, or the idea-combination that was the Christian movement.  The DVD is silent about this idea, despite the marketing text ""What is known about the historicity of Jesus?  Is his existence indisputable?""

This documentary DVD (along with the Social Gospel, the Context Group, Liberation Theology, Richard Horsley, Brian McLaren, Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and N.T. Wright's Fresh Perspective) asks us to graduate from position 1 (Jesus as unprecedented causal genius) to position 2 (native Judaism origins) and to portions of position 3 (the Jesus figure was a product of counter-imperial ideas throughout the Roman Empire).  But despite the DVD's marketing text, this DVD does not follow its own arguments through to consider the full question of whether Jesus was strictly an allegorical product created by popular counter-imperial ideas.",1194739200,8,6969,5.305732484076433
8088620,5,B000BKVLAC,"I recently purchased the DVD and in contrast to D.B.K's review I found both volumes on the single DVD.  Playing time for each volume is approx. 50 min.  I was ""glued"" to the screen for the entire 100 min.  It definitely holds your attention.  It is excellent as most A&E Biography programs are. Jack Perkins is a very good narrator. The photography is stunning.  The choice of paintings and actual locations are definitely appropiate to the subject.  A few guest experts give their opinions which are well-balanced.  A major stong point is both sides of each question are given with a balanced, unbiased presentation.  The viewer can evaluate the evidence on both sides of a question and make up his own mind. Highly recommended!",1155340800,12,729,4.82258064516129
8088621,2,B000BKVLAC,"The assertion that Jesus Christ never existed is beyond ridiculous. Whether you accept Him as your savior or not, his existence is thoroughly documented in many sources, including from those who were hostile to him and would have preferred he didn't exist - the Romans and the Jews. We have many reliable ancient Roman and Jewish texts from the time period of Jesus that corroborate his life and the message of the Gospels.

Only the most rabid, fanatical atheists deny the existence of Jesus. For factual information corroborating the existence of Jesus, I recommend ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel.",1135468800,4,605,4.99009900990099
8088622,4,B000BKVLAC,"As the title states, this video focuses on the Jesus of history, not the Jesus of faith.  And it does an excellent job of it.  Many topics are covered, including Jesus' family life...  was Jesus an only child, or not?  Did he travel abroad in his youth, to India perhaps, or even Britain?  Did he spend any time with the religious community at Qumran, who wrote the Dead Sea scrolls?  Was he a disciple of John the Baptist?  And was he married?  If so, to whom?

These topics, and others, are tackled by historians and theologians, though the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions.  There are not many concrete answers here, but there is a lot to contemplate.

Four stars!",1100563200,7,684,4.435483870967742
