8339388,5,B001S2Q5WQ,"This is a great indie film with a lot of depth. Writer/ actress Laura Lee Bahr explores the soul of a lonely, lost, self-destructive girl in search of herself in a world where she doesn't fit in. At times it is quirky and cute, at times it's desperate and vulnerable, the end is heartrending. Definitely recommend!",1272931200,,314,4.625
