Professor James Nestingen is a powerful speaker, and inspiration to all, and he adds humor to his poignant instructions on how to pray the Lord's Prayer, the greatest prayer Christians can pray.  This is an excellent video, one that I would highly recommend to anyone.",1021420800,,362,4.73015873015873
8411479,5,B00006785D,"Dr. James Nestingen Has made an excellent resource for both people who are seeking personal spirituality in prayer or for those who are seeking to teach prayer and meditation in a group setting. Dr. Nestingen's years of experience as a pastor and a professor have led to this very high quality work on prayer that is simple and understandable to all people, even those who are not keeping up on church vocabulary and literature. The basic prayer used is the Lord's Prayer. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to go deeper into their prayer life.",1021420800,,559,4.714285714285714
