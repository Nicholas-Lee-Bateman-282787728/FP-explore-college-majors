I previously had Blood at Sundown on a Sartana 10 pack with very poor vhs quaility. The picture for BAS is top notch here. Flawless in fact. A Coffin For The Sheriff has never looked better either. I got that one on one of my 10, 20, 25, 44 packs somewhere. Spaghetti westerns are sooooo addictive. They are way better than American westerns. Just watch out for the comedy ones like Little Rita. How godawful. There are a few more comedy spaghetti westerns but not many thank Satan! Anyway, got to gush over this being the definitive release of one of the baddest boys ever with Sartana's first outing. He is just toooo bad. lol. Weird that he became a good guy in the sequels - or anti-hero if you will. Ciao!",1417996800,5,814,4.469798657718121
