6019639,4,B00FPUN4BM,"I hadn't seen this movie since 1957 and wondered if it was still as good as I remembered.  It is!  Thanks to Fox Cinema Archives for bringing another fun movie out on dvd.  Peggy Cummins was hired to play the lead in FOREVER AMBER but got the ax.  But she is a delight in this one along with Victor Mature, Patricia Medina and Ethel Barrymore.  Cummins is very likeable and believable thought the film. The only other movie I have ever  seen her in is THE LATE GEORGE APLEY.  For anyone who enjoys watching black and white
mysteries on a Saturday night this is one to get.",1400284800,,572,4.289719626168225
6019640,4,B00FPUN4BM,"Peggy Cummins of Gun Crazy-fame stars in a Victorian film noir. I'm fond of these Gaslight- or Spiral Staircase-kind of gothic crime movies, so of course I like this one. The only drawback is that Victor Mature gets no chance of doing much with his part.",1398384000,,254,4.543478260869565
6019641,5,B00FPUN4BM,"Excellent movie, Peggy Cummins and Victor Mature give an excellent performance in ""Moss
rose"". Its the kind of movie you can watch again and again...  Great family entertainment!",1395100800,,178,5.357142857142857
6019642,4,B00FPUN4BM,"Any noir fan would enjoy this film, although ""purists"" would resist the turn-of-the-century setting. The excitement builds up throughout the film. The cast is great - including Ethel Barrymore, Vincent Price, and George Zucco. Mature and Cummins are good together. This will satisfy you taste to see stars in early roles.",1394841600,,321,5.313725490196078
6019643,1,B00FPUN4BM,"DVD was returned, because it was way to dark in picture quality. I would never order it again for any reason.",1390694400,2,109,4.238095238095238
6019644,4,B00FPUN4BM,I didn't know what to expect from this film but found myself really enjoying it.  I mean how can you go wrong with Vincent Price and Ethel Barrymore!  Enjoyable film...not too out of the box for this era but still kept you wondering.,1388448000,2,233,4.395348837209302
6019645,4,B00FPUN4BM,"Moss Rose (1947) is a very good ""who done it?"" that should keep you
guessing until the last 10 minutes. The cast includes Peggy Cummins, Victor Mature
and Ethel Barrymore. Vincent Price and Patricia Medina have featured roles.

A woman is found murdered in her room, which sets off a series of events
that ultimately puts the lives of two other women in eminent danger.
Once the attempt to murder the final victim is thwarted, things are wrapped
up quickly, so you may have a few lingering questions, but that's typical
of so many mystery thrillers in order to keep you guessing for as long as possible.
If you like Gaslight, The Spiral Staircase, The Lodger and Hangover Square,
I am sure you will enjoy Moss Rose.

The picture and sound quality are far above Fox Cinema Archives usual standards,
which is a relief since I have been waiting a long time to see this film again.
If I could, I'd give this film 4 1/2 stars!",1382227200,18,921,4.508982035928144

8617791,5,B00FPUN4BM,"This review is for the movie not the DVD. As a Vincent Price fan and collector and fan of Victor Mature and film noir type movies I was
surprised to find this movie. It also has Peggy Cummins who is great as she was in Curse of the Demon with Dana Andrews. As a Price
fan he's great as always and here plays a detective! a good detective. so it's no horror movie. My favorite film of his is Laura with him
and Andrews and it's not a horror film either. Price has a small role but he's so good it's worth getting the movie if your a fan but the
movie itself is a film noir mystery classic that has just been forgotten and over looked compared to some that are more popular like
Maltese Falcon which to me is so over rated and not even close to the best. This movie has a great murder mystery story and the
ending is very good and if you've seen enough you can figure out who the killer is like I did! Mature is as good as always but his best
movie is KISS of Death which is more of a crime gangster film. But this is one of the best mystery film noir movie with or without Price.",1452643200,,1078,3.94954128440367

8617793,5,B00FPUN4BM,A classic. Great character actors. This is really for true movie lovers.,1426377600,,72,5.083333333333333
8617794,4,B00FPUN4BM,Peggy Cummins is really cute and likeable in this mystery and everyone else looks guilty.  Of course Victor Mature is your prime suspect as the rich son of a wealthy family that was seperated from his mother (Ethel Barrymore) when he was young and grew up in Canada with his father.  He is getting ready to get married and a dancer that he was seeing on the side has been murdered.  Peggy thinks he did it and blackmails him to take him to his rich country family home for two weeks so she can be treated like a lady.  Did he do it to keep from getting bad publicity or did he do it because he is a murderer?  Enjoyable little who-dun-it?  Worth a watch.,1425859200,,654,4.192

8617797,5,B00FPUN4BM,"This is a good movie and I enjoy it.  Always have.  It has many fine actors - Victor Mature, Peggy Cummins, Ethel Barrymore, Vincent Price, Rhys Williams, Patricia Medina, and George Zucco.  Miss Barrymore's performance is especially good as always.  All these wonderful people have passed on but thank God we can still enjoy their work.  If you like older films and former eras you might like this one.  .",1403568000,,406,4.728571428571429
8617798,4,B00FPUN4BM,"I really enjoyed it.  Had seen it as a little girl; and only remembered one scene.  Although it is an old movie and much simpler than what the current films are, it is still a good mystery.  Fun to watch.",1403308800,,204,4.05
8617799,4,B00FPUN4BM,"This was a real treat. I didn't know anything about this movie and it was a lot of fun trying to figure out where it was headed. I won't say anymore. Why spoil it? Give it a chance. If you don't like it, you've seen worse.",1402358400,,222,3.847826086956522
