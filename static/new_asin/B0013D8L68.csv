3103102,4,B0013D8L68,"Background music is so loud it ruins the film at first; however, watched it until the end and justice was served in some small measure.  The problem of illegal immigration and the human suffering that is endured by the people just trying to make a life, is ever so sad.  They should be blaming their own country through for their poverty and using the energy they spend coming here to clean up the legal white collar crime that is robbing their citizens, who want to work for a living, of their chance to support their families.  Human greed always promotes human suffering.  Shame on a government who oppresses their people to the point that they would risk death for a better life.  For a low-budget film, this was not bad.  Too many of the world's elite turning their backs on the laborers who sweat to create their luxurious lifestyles.  Double shame on the lot of them.",1427587200,3,874,4.564102564102564

Timeless due to the incessant rule of the seven deadly sins. Those who didn't get this are detined to repeat history because they are incapable of learning from it. The film was done well, the acting credible (most ordinary folks don't behave ""over-the-top"" like most of the ""A-Listers"" portray the common man!), and the situations probably understated but dead on the money whern it comes to our ""order"" to the south. This should be required watching for all of those in power in WDC and, if they don't get it, kick 'em out but don't wait for an election. A powerful picture!",1417219200,3,785,4.779411764705882

3103122,3,B0013D8L68,"This testosterone laden production sheds a little light on a different side of the illegal immigrant issue.  It shows us that these poor people are often sold out by their paid guides and robbed by bandits of their few meager possessions.  That piece of info is the only revelation in this mundane production.  The tale is of a group of Border Patrol agents that are assigned to control the escalating violence resulting from the immigrant robberies.  The agents have a few successes until the well organized bandits begin killing agents.  Of course politicians step in to save the agents by pulling the plug on everything and shutting the operation down. Surprise, surprise these guys made a promise and we wouldn't have a movie unless they tried to keep it.  The director gives you the ""we're bad asses"" shot so many times that it becomes almost comical....O.K.! We get it.  They flex and pose their way through ""The gang that couldn't shoot straight"" culminating with the obvious showdown with the bad guys at the end.  The story was fair, the acting and writing was passable, and the overall production was decent.  If you're home on a Saturday afternoon this ones isn't bad to watch between phone calls and loads of laundry.",1416355200,4,1229,4.814285714285714

Special effects were bad and timing was worse. Actors unable to convince anyone of anything. Everything was predictable, Etc...

I really tried to watch to the end but could not take it anymore after half the movie. I was hoping that some action would help save me from boredom but it was not meant to be.",1426896000,,439,4.353658536585366

Timeless due to the incessant rule of the seven deadly sins. Those who didn't get this are detined to repeat history because they are incapable of learning from it. The film was done well, the acting credible (most ordinary folks don't behave ""over-the-top"" like most of the ""A-Listers"" portray the common man!), and the situations probably understated but dead on the money whern it comes to our ""order"" to the south. This should be required watching for all of those in power in WDC and, if they don't get it, kick 'em out but don't wait for an election. A powerful picture!",1417219200,3,785,4.779411764705882

3337619,3,B0013D8L68,"This testosterone laden production sheds a little light on a different side of the illegal immigrant issue.  It shows us that these poor people are often sold out by their paid guides and robbed by bandits of their few meager possessions.  That piece of info is the only revelation in this mundane production.  The tale is of a group of Border Patrol agents that are assigned to control the escalating violence resulting from the immigrant robberies.  The agents have a few successes until the well organized bandits begin killing agents.  Of course politicians step in to save the agents by pulling the plug on everything and shutting the operation down. Surprise, surprise these guys made a promise and we wouldn't have a movie unless they tried to keep it.  The director gives you the ""we're bad asses"" shot so many times that it becomes almost comical....O.K.! We get it.  They flex and pose their way through ""The gang that couldn't shoot straight"" culminating with the obvious showdown with the bad guys at the end.  The story was fair, the acting and writing was passable, and the overall production was decent.  If you're home on a Saturday afternoon this ones isn't bad to watch between phone calls and loads of laundry.",1416355200,4,1229,4.814285714285714
