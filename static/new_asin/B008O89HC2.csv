8529295,2,B008O89HC2,"I love the concept of fractal art combined with meditation.  Some suggestions:  I didn't fully understand the alpha, theta, delta, and gamma concept.  I was disappointed that the different frequencies had the same exact video, repeated 4 times.  The images were interesting, but a bit dark and outer spacey.  I have had this video since Christmas 2014.  Based on results, I am not motivated to use this DVD repeatedly.  I can appreciate the time associated with making animation.  Thank you for your hard work and passion to heal others.",1425686400,3,537,4.955056179775281
8529296,5,B008O89HC2,I like the idea of the binarual beats and being able to focus on the fractals at the same time. The fractals are stunning to watch especially set to music. I am enjoying experimenting with the different frequencies.,1377216000,8,215,4.684210526315789
