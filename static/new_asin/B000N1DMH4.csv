8468674,4,B000N1DMH4,"This is a hard-to-find movie in the US as it was only released in PAL.  I did
have a DVD which was 'hacked' to decode PAL as well as NTSB.  The movie is
mostly a coming-of-age film for a young teenage boy in a small village in 70's, Spain.

There are many things going on and many things for him to learn about growing
up while being hassled by the local toughs.  Things happen rather quickly but
the director moves things right along without lingering to hammer-out any
political statements or whatever.  You have to find out for yourself what
went on in the 70's, as well as some of the more mature subject matter which
is dealt with in the screenplay.  It is mature, but not above what the teens
deal with everyday in the USA as well as Europe or any other county.  It's
a nice story, sad in parts, but things work out in the end.  The village goes
back to being mostly the same simple town it was before we intruded on the
scene.  The actors, especially all the young ones, are excellent and a sound
track came with the DVD.  A good deal if you have PAL capabilites on your DVD
or if you have a foreign film collection.  The CD Soundtrack is standard and
the movie does play on a computer if you change the region code.  Rich Holst,
