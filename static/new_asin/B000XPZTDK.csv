8335343,4,B000XPZTDK,"This DVD was interesting and informative.  It could not possibly cover every single popular and well-known spot, however, made a very good attempt.  The DVD material was not new and was, therefore, somewhat dated and a bit fuzzy, not sharp.  It was worthwhile watching though, especially for anyone either homesick for Scotland, or is a Scotophile.  Beautiful scenery throughout.",1300320000,,379,5.372881355932203
