1975399,3,B00016XOB0,"While I loved this show when it aired, the WB is really screwing things up.  This DVD includes four episodes, however, if you bought Batman: The Legend Begins, you'll have bought the same episode twice (Christmas with the Joker)
Here are the episodes:
Christmas with the Joker
The Laughing Fish
Fire from Olympus
Deepr Freeze",1079136000,18,325,4.909090909090909
1975400,3,B00016XOB0,"I have loved the Animated Series of Batman, and I greatly anticipated getting more of the series on DVD. The only problem is that on this disc they have repeated a ""Christmas with Joker"" episode that was on ""Batman the Legend Begins"" DVD. If you are planning on ordering this DVD, I do recommend it for the other three episodes that are on the disc, but thought consumers should be forwarned of the episode duplication.
I also would like to add that it would be nice if the episodes were listed in the product descirption so there aren't surprises.",1078272000,16,548,4.545454545454546
8007448,1,B00016XOB0,"All these episodes ""Christmas with the Joker""
""The Laughing Fish""
""Deep Freeze""
""Fire from Olympus"" are in the volumes of the batman animated series ! So it's more worth it to buy the series than this!",1503187200,,201,4.611111111111111
8007449,5,B00016XOB0,It reminds me one of the great cartoons in the 90's Batman animated series you can not beat that any where i enjoyed it very much,1501113600,,129,4.0

8007452,4,B00016XOB0,"These little DVD packages of select episodes are only worth it if A) You are getting it as a gift for a kid or someone who has a casual and budding interest in the greatest hero of all time or B) You want to own every single thing Batman has ever appeared in. Otherwise, save the money and invest it into the actual volumes of the Animated series that contain the same episodes. It's one of the best cartoons of all time.",1365984000,3,421,4.146341463414634
8007453,2,B00016XOB0,"Great for the casual fan, or older kids.  The DVD actually collects 4 episodes of Batman The Animated Series, and is not 2 features as described.  If you already have the season sets this offers nothing new.",1336176000,2,207,4.5675675675675675
8007454,1,B00016XOB0,"Instead of settling for four episodes, including a retread of what's already been released, go for the recently-released volumes.  Each volume (as of this writing, two are on the market and the third is being released next month) contains 23 episodes.  Every episode, I believe.  All in order.  You don't miss out.  You get every story you remember as a kid (or a younger adult ... you geeks know who you are).  More for your money, folks.  You won't be disappointed.",1114473600,7,467,4.691358024691358
8007455,2,B00016XOB0,Buying this would not make sense if you A. Bought Batman The Animated Series: Volume One or B. Batman TAS The Legend Begins. If you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by Warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought BOTH A. and B. then you would have 3 Christmas' with Joker. Now I would urge you to buy Volume One and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both DVD's. Be safe and read before you buy.,1105920000,7,533,3.8990825688073394
8007456,5,B00016XOB0,"Look...Batman-The Animated Series is, by far, the best interpretation of the Dark Knight outside of the comic books themselves. That's why I rate this DVD 5 stars.
I have good news for all those who complain about the bare bones, 4 episodes per disc DVDs that the WB have been issuing so far.
It turns out that this summer, Warner Bros is finally gonna start releasing Batman- THe animated Series in complete season box sets. With special features galore. Rejoice.",1080172800,15,464,4.8125
8007457,2,B00016XOB0,"I am really getting miffed.  I LOVE this show.  It is exactly why I keep buying up these DVDs.  I am basically wanting to collect every episode of these great series on DVD.
BUT, the repeat of the episode ""Christmas with the Joker"" really has me miffed.  There are only a limited amount of these episodes on DVD and they are repeating episodes?
I am really frustrated because I want these episodes on DVD, but I truly am wasting my money on these [...] products Warner Bros. is producing.  Why is every other television series released in the correct manner?",1079481600,16,558,4.54
