8541463,5,B009H3LO74,"Most eras of The Damned are touched on throughout this set. A bit of Strawberries, Phantasmagoria, the usual Damned Damned Damned stuff and Machine Gun Etiquette stuff, all with some of the newer material (circa 2002) presented.

Dave 'N' Captain lead this new group, consisting of Pinch on drums, Monty Oxymoron on keyboards, Patricia Morrison on bass, and a guest monkey.

No washed up ""rock stars"" here, they keep at it just as involved as any previous decade, only perhaps a little more relaxed.

The extras loved me, and I loved the extras. Patricia and Monty give wonderful interviews, and Pinch gives wonderful frolicking. Snippet of a tour, home recording footage, pleasant stuff, you peoples yous.

Audio and video presentation never scared me, you may be able to rest easy with the lights off.

Thank you, good night, buy it.",1383696000,2,835,4.935714285714286
8541464,5,B009H3LO74,"This isn't just a ten year old concert only now making its DVD debut, it's been out for several years in Europe in the PAL format.  Got to see the band a few months before this was recorded and had to have this so I purchased the PAL version and re-configured my DVD drive.  PAL DVDs get played on the PC and NTSC DVDs get played on the television.  Great arrangement, give it a try!  The only difference in content is...well, none actually.  The only difference is the layout of the cover art and the changeover of all the specs from European to American.  The performance is spot-on, if you saw the tour then this DVD will bring back happy memories for you.  Always loved 'Would You Be So Hot?', good subject and there's a lot of truth in those lyrics.  Good motto really, 'Gimme Some Truth' (ha ha).  Don't really know where the Carlos Santana solo spot came from but am damned glad it's there.  Reminds me a bit of 'Under The Floor Again', a really monstrous emotive solo coming from way out in left field.  All the tunes from 'Grave Disorder' are performed brilliantly.  Here's hoping the MGE:25 set gets an American release very soon, although once again I bought the PAL version years ago.  This is just an incredible release, both audio and video were captured impeccably.  The fun factor is very strong as with all indispensible Damned releases.  The price is unbeatable, the value-for-money factor is well in favor of the consumer on this one.  Just get it...immediately!",1380067200,3,1481,4.595419847328245
8541465,5,B009H3LO74,"This dvd is so good, I'm finally not mad anymore about the unnecessary narrator talking OVER SONGS in The Damned ""Final Damnation"" dvd. This performance shows The Damned can still rock harder than anyone, EVER.
Captain Sensible even does ""Happy Talk,"" for some reason, and it's great.
If you ever listened to The Damned, you probably like them, so buy this. Excellent concert and interviews with the band in bonus features. A good deal.",1370563200,,436,4.905405405405405
8541466,5,B009H3LO74,"The Damned. What do you expect me to say about The Damned? Original members Dave Vanian (vocals) and Captain Sensible (guitar) are joined here by the amazing Patricia Morrison (The Gun Club, Sisters Of Mercy) on bass, Monty Oxy Moron on keyboards, and Pinch on drums, for a killer performance at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire on July 31, 2002. Why it's just now getting a DVD release is a bit of a mystery, but let's not look a gift horse in the mouth... it's The Damned! The band is in fine form here, and both the audio (with a 5.1 digital mix) and video (with a widescreen option) are top-notch. The setlist is a nice mix of must-hear classics (`I Just Can't Be Happy Today', `Neat Neat Neat', `New Rose', `Smash It Up', `It's A Love Song') and newer material, particularly from their at-the-time just-released `Grave Disorder' (including `She', `Song. Com', and `Democracy?'). There's even a bit of fun to be had when Captain Sensible takes center stage - complete with his own backup Tiki dancers! - for a run through the show tune `Happy Talk', which the good Captain took to Number 1 on the UK Pop Charts back in 1982. As if this wasn't enough, `Tiki Nightmare' also contains some cool bonus features in the form of an extensive photo gallery, a discography, and some well-worth-watching interviews. At the end of the day, there's only one thing to consider here and when you say it out loud you'll understand: it's The Damned.",1368144000,2,1436,4.65748031496063
8541467,5,B009H3LO74,"This is an amazing performance DVD, professionally shot with great sound & editing. Patricia Morrison on bass, Captain Sensible on Guitar, Pinch on drums, Monty Oxymoron on keys & the inimitable Dave Vanian on vocals, this is perhaps the best lineup the Damned have ever had. Most of the classic live setlist is here (plus a few surprises from Phantasmagoria & Strawberries) and songs from the great Nitro LP GRAVE DISORDER. If you are a fan of Captain Sensible (Damned AND solo) he's featured in some nice bonus materials (along with each individual member). The Damned are a great live act & if you've seen them within the past decade this show is a great souvenir-if you've not seen them in person this is a decent substitute. If you're even just a casual fan you should buy this!",1360022400,3,783,4.681159420289855
