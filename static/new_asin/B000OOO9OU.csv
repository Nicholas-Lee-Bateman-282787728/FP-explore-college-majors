2798327,5,B000OOO9OU,"This is a great instructional comedy for breakdancing.  It kicked me off the edge of my seat and got me attempting many of the moves.  As bad of a dancer that I am, its a miracle that I was able to pick up some of these moves.  Ace really breaks it down to the basic elements so even a horrible dancer like me can pick up the moves.

The great thing about this film is that it is funny and a very effective instructional video.  Most instructional videos are boring and its difficult to stay motivated to keep up with the instructions, but you won't have a problem with this video.  My props go off to Ace and his co-producers.  They really came up with a great product here.

2798328,5,B000OOO9OU,"Rare combination of excellent instruction and entertainment. Ace is a true talent: he is not only uniquely funny, but a master at teaching this dance. He owns this dance, and he IS the Moonwalk!",1178409600,,194,4.735294117647059
2798329,5,B000OOO9OU,"I just recently picked up this DVD and thought it was really cool. Besides the teacher having a sense of humor, it actually is really easy to pick up the moves he teaches. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the basics. I don't believe in white man disease that they cant dance so get this if you want to learn by an easy to understand and funny teacher.",1177632000,2,371,4.166666666666667

2798331,5,B000OOO9OU,"Top 20 Breakdance Moves is a refreshing how-to-dance video that demonstrates some of the most popular and well-known hip-hop / breakdancing moves. The reason why this video is refreshing and unlike other how-to-dance videos is that the instructor ""Ace"" really spends a great deal of time breaking down each movement so one can really get an understanding. There's a lot of emphasis on the fundamental movements needed to perform the moves which makes it stand out from other dance videos.

HOWEVER, the best thing about this video is the entertainment aspect. I guarantee will you not stop laughing while you're trying to learn the moves. Ace presents each lesson with different characterizations that keeps things from ever getting boring. This video is so entertaining you could simply watch it straight through.

Seriously though, for the price, I don't think there's a better video that breaks down the fundamentals needed to learn the moves. And, what is already a comprehensive video (over 2 hours long!) is made better by the fact that it's entertaining as well. Highly recommended!",1177459200,8,1089,5.146892655367232
2798392,5,B000OOO9OU,"The instructor ""Ace"" is very, very funny.  I can watch this video over and over and still laugh.  He also breaks down the moves very slowly so you can actually learn the moves.  Most ""learn dance"" videos require one to watch the moves over and over so I can't over emphasize how great it is to laugh while learning the moves.

As for some reviews the criticize this DVD as not being ""true breakdance"" moves. I'm a Bboy and I would would agree that most would consider only about 5 of the moves taught as ""breakdance moves"" and the other 15 as ""party dances."" But so what? Many breakers can use a few more ""dancey"" moves to mix in with their ""power moves.""

This is a great DVD and emphasizes one of the most important aspects of dance. That it should be fun.

The only criticism I have of this video is that it would have been useful to be able to loop the same move over and over without rewinding.",1208217600,2,899,4.228070175438597
2798393,5,B000OOO9OU,Basically the best how to video ever. Very informative and funny! The guys are way more entertaining than your average instructional video. And their HOT!,1208131200,,154,5.2
2798394,5,B000OOO9OU,"""Top 20 Breakdance Moves"" is fantastic!  The video is both incredibly instructive and exceptionally entertaining.  ""Ace"", employing several hilarious characters, dissects each dance move into easy to follow steps.  Even the biggest dancing maladroit will learn how to become a BBoy (or BGirl) with the help of Ace's breakin expertise!",1199491200,,334,5.64
2798395,5,B000OOO9OU,"""Top 20 Breakdance Moves"" was a holiday gift for a friend. I had so much fun when she invited me over to learn some moves that I couldn't help but buy the DVD for myself! Not only is Ace hilarious, his steps helped me to be the bgirl I've always wanted to be...with confidence!!! And I haven't stopped doing the Harlem Shake since!! I also checked out Ace's website. I've become a HUGE fan...Can't wait for the next video!",1198800000,,422,4.3544303797468356
2798396,2,B000OOO9OU,"Ok well i watched previews of the dvd and it has moves such as
THE MOONWALK
THE WOP
THE BUTTERFLY
THE HERLEM SHAKE
THE James Brown
the mc hammer dance

.... I am a real breakdancer and as far as im aware this isn't breakdancing (bboying) at all, This should dvd shud be renamed

It is meant to be a breakdance instructional, And it doesnt even teach you simple moves like the toprock,uprock, or floats

If your looking for a good breakdance dvd buy breakdance step by step

you want to know the truth, ??
This guy is not a real bboy, and he doesnt know more than 3 breakdance moves , and 4 of his moves are actually hip hop moves and the rest are all made up by him to fill in the gaps, He made up atleast 13 of the moves, AND IT SAYS BREAKDANCE, I don't even use three quarters of his moves he teaches THIS DVD IS ""STUPID"" , Im telling the truth",1193356800,15,846,4.017857142857143
2798397,5,B000OOO9OU,"The best thing about this video is that it's not boring.  You learn so much and ACE really keeps you interested.  Most instructional videos put you to sleep or you lose attention but the way this video was cut keeps you watching it over and over.  It's refreshing to see a new approach to dance instruction.  Best part is, you really learn!  And ACE is an amazing teacher!",1182816000,2,372,4.411764705882353
2798398,5,B000OOO9OU,"Ace will teach you to moonwalk, six step, wave, body wave, worm, james brown and laugh till it hurts.  Not only is he a great dancer and instructor that will break down each move into it's most basic parts, he also has a great sense of humor.  The video is basic enough for those with little dance experience to learn from and the funny parts will keep everyone entertained throughout - I can see people having fun by learning from this DVD in a group.

I especially liked the moonwalk section taught by ""Ace Jackson"" - I seriously had to rewind the video because I missed parts b/c I was laughing too hard.  Get the video, you will learn some moves and laugh - real hard.",1182556800,2,672,4.309523809523809
2798399,5,B000OOO9OU,"The guys of Elastic Illusion are massively talented! This video took me back to a very happy place, a simpler time, where dancing was everything. I enjoyed the ride. Funny, smart and well executed, I'd recommend Top 20 Breakdance Moves to anyone with a sense of humor and a love for urban dance. LOVED IT!!!",1181692800,2,307,4.6
2798400,5,B000OOO9OU,He is 7 and loves this DVD! My sister is forever grateful. The best is when i try to do the moves with him... that really gets him laughing. That is worth the price of DVD 2000 times over. Thanks guys for creating something that crosses the ages and abilities!!!,1181520000,4,262,4.26
2798401,5,B000OOO9OU,"Ace is fantastic.  If you master these moves, you will entertain the people around you as well as yourself, as that is what he does in the dvd.  Not only did I learn some sweet moves, but I laughed my ayss off.  Buy the movie because you will be happy you did, and you will probably also wish the creators were your homies.  Hottt.",1181001600,2,331,4.125
2798442,5,B000OOO9OU,"My son showed me these Elastic Illusion guys from a site called youtube. What can I say, I had so much fun watching their videos with my son, that I bought him both of their dvds. One teaches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/robot/dp/B000MR9JA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">robot</a>&nbsp;and one teaches breakdance. Now he watches the Top 20 Breakdance DVD with his friends and they always practice. I can almost say that my son's Playstation is collecting dust, well not quite, but this is the first interest in physical activity my son has had since he stopped playing competitive sports. I am so happy that he has found a healthier activity. I think the instructor ACE is a very inspirational teacher for males who are worried that dance is just for girls. Two thumbs up from a happy DAD! Just the opening menu screen alone is quite hysterical.",1180828800,8,888,5.35
2798443,4,B000OOO9OU,"I'd recommend this video for anyone wishing they could do more on the dance floor than sip rum and coke. The instructor is pretty damn good and quirky as heck. You may still come out of it looking like Carlton from Fresh Prince but  it's definitely a lot of fun. I'm still working on the Windmill, but I have the Cabbage Patch down pat!!",1180742400,,337,4.265625
2798444,5,B000OOO9OU,"Level 1:  Probably one of the best dance instructional videos I've ever seen.

Level 2:  Highly entertaining.  Comedy worthy of SNL

Level 3:  A chance to watch brilliant artists do what they do best!

There's actually no reason NOT to buy this DVD...so you probably should buy it.  You can't argue with that kind of logic!",1180569600,,323,4.642857142857143
2798445,5,B000OOO9OU,"Man, where to begin. The super random style of cuts (you have to see the video to understand), the 20+ dance moves included, the fact that every lesson is done in character, the music, the cool lesson selector that shows you every video, the TYPEWRITER! (inside joke). I have NEVER seen a video like this, dance or otherwise. This guy should be in movies, he is so funny and versatile and wow, I've never seen a white guy dance like that. 5 stars.",1180483200,,447,4.397590361445783
2798446,5,B000OOO9OU,"I am an Irish dancer. After seeing How To Do The Robot and loving that, I decided to check out their other video, Top 20 Breakdance Moves. This one is just as good and I've learned so many dances. C-walking, Harlem Shake, the Roger Rabbit, the Running Man, even the breakdance moves like the Windmill. He makes these moves which look so hard seem easy. It's great",1180483200,,363,4.432835820895522
2798447,5,B000OOO9OU,"I've been having a lot of fun with this DVD!!!!!!!!!!

It's funny and gets you up and out of your seat.  The instruction shows you the moves in a way that makes you think ""I can do that!""

This would make a great gift for anyone that's energetic or like to dance!!!!!!!!!!",1179878400,,272,4.1923076923076925
2798448,5,B000OOO9OU,"Well all i can say is WOW, YES, FINALLY!  I had a feeling this was going to be an entertaining DVD, but i had no idea it was going to have me laughing out loud on just about every lesson. I wouldn't consider all the moves Ace teaches breakdancing, but i still found them to be valuable and of course very entertaining. I highly recommend this DVD just for the laughs alone. The guys at Elastic Illusion are clearly having fun and i have also ordered ""How To Do The Robot"".  Again y'all, highly recommended!",1179705600,,506,4.315789473684211
2798449,4,B000OOO9OU,I love this one.  Super fun and easy to follow.  Puts a smile on your face and a skip in your step...what better mood for doing a little breakdancing?  Great instruction on many different levels.,1179446400,,195,4.514285714285714
2798450,5,B000OOO9OU,"You'll learn the fine points of tons of moves off this video. The attitude is hilarious, the characters reveal Ace has an impressively sharp eye for the nuances that provide the flavor missing from moves on other dvds.

Ace spends some focussed time on one or two more technical moves which i wasn't as interested in committing to. I usually just skip those segments, except to simply watch the *gold* Ace (Michael) Jackson material. But when i want to master those specialist moves this is definitely the dvd i would use.

You can feel these guys love what they're doing! I've now got the elastic illusion robot dvd (after initially saying robot's not my thing) on its way, and hanging out for the pop-locking dvd to be released.",1179360000,,730,4.6953125
2798451,3,B000OOO9OU,"Apparently, my gross motor skills are far worse than I anticipated.  I found myself freeze-framing, rewinding and slow-forwarding through most of the dance segments.  Yes, the instructor is entertaining (cheesy/campy/silly), but if you're one of those people who needs to see something repeated several times and shown from multiple camera angles, then look elsewhere.  I liked the Kelly Peters ""Make It Happen Hip Hop"" DVDs -- slower paced, useful split screen feature, etc.",1178928000,6,475,5.47945205479452
8185946,4,B000OOO9OU,Would be nice to have seen more examples of how to build up conditioning to do the moves.  The main guy has a good vibe overall and is a good place to learn the basics.,1393718400,,168,3.8
8185947,5,B000OOO9OU,"Really funny yet effective teaching of great moves. In the Youtube clips, you can see Elastic illusion in action and laugh your head off, yet you need to DVD to see him break down the moves.  As it is only available from American Amazon, I had an 11  extra Royal Mail charge to receive this overseas package, despite paying postage at the time of ordering. Ouch!
Consequently, an expensive piece of fun!",1386374400,,403,4.583333333333333
8185948,5,B000OOO9OU,This DVD actually was pretty cool.  I bought it as a gift and we both checked it out.  Goes a little fast but not bad.  Lots of cool moves.,1354579200,,139,3.7241379310344827
8185949,4,B000OOO9OU,"Funny video, good instruction, but why spend 25$ when you can watch it on Amazon Prime for 7 days for $2.00?",1324512000,,108,4.190476190476191
8185950,1,B000OOO9OU,"The majority of moves on this dvd are not bboy moves.  I know these guys and they are ripping you off.  Do not purchase this dvd.  The Elastic Illusion company made up all these reviews (except the negative ones!).  In fact, I suspect if Amazon checked the IP addresses of the reviews, they would find them mostly done from just a couple computers.",1254528000,5,348,4.476190476190476
8185951,3,B000OOO9OU,"This is an OK video series. The quality is very bad, and the instruction method is rather confusing. You also can find them on youtube. Its well organized, however, and will teach you if you put the time into it.",1253664000,,212,4.325
8185952,5,B000OOO9OU,"Nonostante sia in inglese il tutto  capibilissimo. Comunque si pu provarne un assaggio su youtube con la key breakdance dvd. In pratica come ho fatto io. Ho visto che funzionava ed ho preso il dvd perch merita. Amazon  molto affidabile, a me il dvd  arrivato nel giro di 15 gg con la spedizione standard, ma io sono di Milano, magari per Palermo ci vuole qualche giorno in pi.
Comunque ve lo consiglio caldamente. Buy the DVD. Hare Shilvio. Hare, hare papi. Buy the DVD.",1249862400,,470,4.571428571428571
8185953,2,B000OOO9OU,"I have to wonder if many of the other reviews were written by friends of the dance group which made this video.  The instruction is decent, and the dancers talented.  However, most of the time is spent on inane, unscripted chatter and incredibly repetitive pitches for another video produced by the same group.  Makes watching the video so annoying I mute it. Might have given it 3 stars, but am trying to counterbalance the apparent over-rating.",1247788800,5,446,4.842105263157895
8185954,5,B000OOO9OU,"I bought this DVD after watching a few of the clips on youtube. I am very happy with it. I am a beginner at breakdancing, and I learnt a lot of the moves from the DVD after repeated viewing and practise. The instructor Ace is not only talented, but extremely hilarious. He demonstrates 20 different types of Break dance moves from Hammer, Michael Jackson (Moon walk, Side Glide), Heel Toe, Snake, Arm Wave, Body Wave, Chicken Head etc. I agree with some of the reviewers, some parts are so funny that I had rewind the clip to watch the moves again; because I would be laughing so hard, that I would miss the instruction the first time. He first starts out each move with a demonstration, then he follows it up with breaking it down and then doing a final demo in slow motion. There are a few moves which seem kinda outdated, but for the most part, I loved the DVD.",1229299200,2,864,4.339506172839506
8185955,5,B000OOO9OU,"I do not own this DVD, but if you go to [...] you can watch the lessons on there and follow along. I absolutely love it! Ace is SO funny and makes learning a BLAST! I've learned SO much! But like I said, you can go to their YouTube page and watch the lessons there for free!",1219795200,2,274,3.824561403508772
