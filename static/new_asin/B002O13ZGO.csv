It provides the Arabic etymology for the word cotton.  It said cotton has four places of origin, but is now grown in more than 100 countries.

I'm an African American and I am aware of how cotton production played a role in aggravating US slavery.  I approached this topic delicately.  However, I am glad the show did not gloss over the matter.  Then again, it said cotton sparked the US Civil War more than it says it influenced this awful institution.  But the show goes even deeper than American slavery.  It said cotton played a role in the UK's imperialism against India.  It said British cotton mills were places of child exploitation.  It added that originally wool producers didn't want cotton to spread in England.  Thus, just like today, some industries actively try to kill off or suppress other ones.

This also spoke about the environmental downside of cotton.  It says cotton sucks lots of nutrients out of the ground.  It took about a century to find a pesticide to defeat the boll weevil.  The large amount of pesticides needed plays a role in hurting the environment.  However, it says we use all parts of cotton now.  It makes an oil that can be useful.  You can feed the seeds to livestock.  The show says cotton plays a role in the production of potato chips too.

Like the episode about potatoes, this was quite an informative installment.",1369526400,,1533,4.70566037735849
