8218161,3,B000VD5HWC,"I bought this DVD to show my ""B"" level World History students.  They were totally lost.  The music was a bit loud and the audio was a bit too soft.  It moved rather quickly which made it even harder for them to follow.  This series is good for the teacher to watch, but it is a bit too thick for freshmen.  I also recommend it for European AP students and college students taking European History.",1331683200,2,397,4.24
8218162,2,B000VD5HWC,"I didn't like this video.  Their experts are uninteresting to listen to and the music is terrible! I had hoped to be able to use it in class, but my students would fall asleep.",1305590400,4,176,4.176470588235294
8218163,5,B000VD5HWC,"Fortunately for me, this program and it's companion video were relatively easy to create. I had a lot of great cutaways and animations that came from a stock footage library we have. Professor Margret Jacob had called to thank us for her complimentary copy of the program and to say that she liked it very much. I took the opportunity to ask her a question about something that had me confused. I noticed that the moon doesn't always pass by the same area of the sky each night. Initally I thought, 'Well it must be bobbing and dipping like ocean swells would make a light weight ball react' but no. It's more extreme than that. One night it would be just above Orions belt and the next night it is high in the sky around Pleiades. As I explained my confusion to her over the phone, I could hear her nodding her head yes and then she says, ""Yes, the Moon definately is not on a straight path. In fact, the path is shaped a lot more like Santa Monica Boulevard."" I know most people won't get that immediately but then when you're done shopping you can find a website that will show you the street which is of course located in the Los Angeles area. Just another fact for you from one of the creators of the Just The Facts series. Enjoy the program!
