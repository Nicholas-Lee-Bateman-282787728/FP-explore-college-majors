8657165,5,B00KB01N8M,"This is the review of UFC 174.

There are 2 excellent fights in UFC 174. They make it worth 5 stars

Rory Macdonald vs Tyron Woodley
Its the second best fight of this show. Rorys boxing and kicking skills were excellent. He landed a lot of them. Round 1 was very exciting. Tyron attacked many times with his knees, kicks and fists. He tried to take down Rory but he failed.
In  the latter half of round 2, Roy was clearly dominant.
In round 3, Rory took down Tyron. That rarely happened.

Demetrious Johnson vs Ali Bagautinov
Its the best fight of this show. Demetrious was very strong, fast and skillful. Ali took down Demetrious near the end of round 2 but he could not take advantage of it.
Round 2 clearly demonstrated Demetrious was stronger. Ali tried to take him down many times but he failed.
In round 3, Demetrious was taken down 2 times but he recovered right away. He also countered attacked by landing some kicks on Al with  amazing speed.
Near the end of round 4, , Demetrious took down Ali but lucky for him, the bell rang.
It ended in round 5. Theres no surprise here.

Ryan Jimmo vs Ovince Saint Preux
Ovince was stronger. Ryan could not take him down. Instead, Ryan was taken down by Ovince. He broke Ryans arm in round 2. Its a lopsided fight.

Andrei Arlovski vs Brendan Schaub
Round 1 and 2 were balanced. Both landed some strikes. Nobody was dominant. Round 3 was bloody. The winner was a big surprise to me. I still don't understand why Andrei was declared a  winner. I think it should have been Shawn.

Rafael Feijao vs Ryan Bader
Its boring because its a lopsided fight. Ryan was too strong for Rafael.

This is the review of UFC 173.

Theres only 1 excellent fight in this show but it makes the show worth 5 stars.

Renan Barao vs TJ Dillashaw
Its the one of the best fight Ive ever seen. It makes this show worth 5 stars.
There was a big surprise near the end of round 1. TJ knocked down Renan with a fist.  Both fighters landed many fists and kicks. Its fast paced, exciting and intense. TJ attacked from the beginning till the end. Its exciting and very intense.
Its one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET

Jamie Varner vs James Krause
Its a lopsided fight. One guy left ankle was badly hurt right in the first minute but he continued to fight. Of course he lost.

Francisco Rivera vs Takeya Mizugaki
In my opinion, even at the end of round 3, Takeya still could not finish off Francisco.

Robbie Lawler vs Jake Ellenberger
Its boring. Robbie was dominant the whole fight. Jake could do nothing.

Dan Handerson vs Daniel Cormier
Its boring. Daniel was always dominant. Most of the time, Daniel was on the floor with Daniel on top of him.",1432684800,2,2664,4.371196754563894
8657166,5,B00KB01N8M,"I'm giving this five stars because quite frankly two full events for six bucks was a damn good buy.  Now, apart from that These two events were similar in a way.  One was a masterful challenger, the other was a masterful champ.  Not telling you which was which if you hadn't seen them. lol but  the two events were very entertaining and I'm a UFC/MMA fan through and through and this shows why MMA is the BEST SPORT in the Entire World, simply because how hard it is and how difference EVERY SINGLE FIGHT is.  One round itself is like exploring an entire world of combative struggles.  Just awesome.",1428796800,,599,4.4495412844036695

8657170,4,B00KB01N8M,"Going into UFC 173 Renan Barao was being hyped up as the clear cut pound for pound best fighter in the world and with a 30+ win streak that was very possible. His opponent TJ Dillashaw set as a massive 10-1 underdog and given virtually no chance of coming away victorious. Could Dillashaw unthrone the pound for pound king? The co main event featured undefeated Daniel Cormier fighting against fellow olympian Dan Henderson. This bout was likely to determine the next title challenger for UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones. And finally the 3rd fight garnering most interest was the 3rd fight on the main card featuring Robbie Lawler coming off a quick turn around from his Johny Hendricks fight to face top ten welterweight Jake Ellenberger. This fight seemed to guarantee Lawler another shot at the title and would certainly put Ellenberger in the talks for a title shot with possibly one more win.

Note: In the editorial review it says Junior Dos Santos vs Stipe Miocic is the co main event. That is false because Dos Santos was injured and Miocic was set to headline another card.

WARNING: Fight RESULTS and SPOILERS below for anyone who hasn't seen the event yet.

Robbie Lawler (winner by round 3 tko) vs Jake Elllenberger

Main Event for the bantamweight championship:
Renan Barao vs TJ Dillashaw (winner by round 5 tko)

As far as the main card fights go Jamie Varner ended up tearing a few ligaments and breaking his ankle in the first round. Although all of that happened very early in the round, he managed to finish all five minutes of the round and ended up quitting before the second round giving James Krause the victory. Takeya Mizugaki grinded out a decision against Francisco Rivera which will now have him closing in on a bantamweight title shot. Robbie Lawler proved to be too much all around for Jake Ellenberger, he outclassed him at all aspects of the fight and finished him with a flurry of punches in the third round. Daniel Cormier used his size, speed and wrestling to literally man handle Dan Henderson for every round. There was moments where Cormier actually picked Hendo up off the ground slamming him. He got control of his back in the third round after tripping him and submitted him with a rear naked choke. Finally for the main event Renan Barao vs TJ Dillashaw. Leading into this Renan Barao was hyped up to be the best pound for pound fighter in the world or at least top 3 along with Jose Aldo and Jon Jones. TJ Dillashaw came out with his A game as his footwork, timing, speed, angles, and ability to mix up strikes were too much for the champion to handle. Dillashaw dropped him with an overhand right in the first round and Barao never seemed to recover. For the next 3 and a half rounds Dillashaw dominated Barao on the feet, finally finishing him in the fifth and final round. When he finished him it was one of those ""holy s***!!"" yell out loud sports moments. I'm not sure whether or not it's because it was most recent or because Barao was dominated for all five rounds of the fight but this outweighs Chris Weidman beating Anderson Silva in my opinion. This has to be one of the biggest upsets in mma and/ or the UFC of all time.

The championship fight is definitely a 5/5 star fight but the rest of the results of the card were to be expected which is why I give this a 4/5 star review. Not the overall best card of the year but certainly one of the best title fights of the year and possibly the biggest upset ever.",1401580800,4,4067,4.624653739612189
