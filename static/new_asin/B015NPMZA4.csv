7445368,5,B015NPMZA4,"A magnificient movie, including the script , the acting, the dances, songs, lyrics, and the MESSAGE of brotherhood and humanity above all.  There is nothing to fault and everything to praise.  Salman Khan is truly exceptional, but the child-actor Malhotra eclipses the superstar.  A star is born!",1445385600,2,296,5.25531914893617
7445369,3,B015NPMZA4,"Salman Khan is one of the rarest of all stars who truly has the hand of God working for him. He could sit in a chair and let the film roll for two hours and have millions of people watching it.
Bajrangi Bhaijaan is about a village simpleton played By Salman Khan who decides to take back a lost child back to her home in Pakistan.
The film is about the journey to Pakistan and incidents on the road where they meet strangers and have strange thing happen to them.
Strictly for fans of Salman Khan, which happens to be the entire universe.",1445299200,,538,4.233009708737864
7445370,2,B015NPMZA4,The copy is not good. Halfway to  the movie it stopped and won't play anymore..saying my TV setting needs to be 4:3 letterbox. Y do I have to change the setting for my TV when I was watching the movie from the beginning with no problem. Amazon needs to look into this or send me another copy..this his is ridiculous that I paid $60 for 3 movies  and shipping.,1444608000,2,359,4.188405797101449
7445371,4,B015NPMZA4,"Let me first go on record to state that Salman is perhaps one of the least talented actors to become so popular in my memory. Having said that (and deeply offended hordes of Sallu fans out there), full credit to him (and our eternally-ready-to-compromise movie-going public) for scaling the popularity heights that he has.

In this movie, a competent film maker, a clever script, the right doses of popular and human sentiments, and, yes Sallu, come together to create a throughly entertaining movie. There is no lecturing and overt drilling of messages into the audience. When unexpected twists do take place, the straightforward attitude, humor and humanity with which the central characters handle the twists is what makes this movie a simple pleasure to watch for all ages. And, believe it or not, Sallu does not take his shirt off even once...actually, I lied...but it somehow doesn't stand out!",1444435200,,900,5.040268456375839

Thank you Salman for a beautiful heartwarming story filled with purity and love.",1444348800,,375,4.0675675675675675

7445380,5,B015NPMZA4,"An amazing movie that takes place during the war between the Indians and the Muslims, I believe. The main character is a bit naive and extremely optimistic, and comes across a young Muslim girl separated by her family and doesn't speak.

Upon finding out her heritage, he has conflicting feelings about her and what to do but keeps his promise to return her home, even putting his life in dangerojs and always choosing an honest and righteous path to bring her home. An extremely beautiful movie",1477440000,,495,4.755813953488372

We should all learn the lesson of love portrayed for someone else, when we have no vested interested and we just want to do the right thing!  Harshali Malhotra made an excellent portrayal a child struggling to communicate without speech.  If you only buy one movie from 2015, this is the one I recommend.

The plot is unlike anything I have ever seen.  The script is magnificent, direction, dialogues, editing, background score are flawless.  Cinematography is breathtaking, locations are out of this world.  Casting was on the dot, acting was superb, what a magnificent, talented cast. The little girl's performance is jaw dropping. Every supporting cast gave an excellent performance.  The main lead character has given possibly the best performance of his career, every emotion of his on screen felt real and touches the heart.  Movies with such high production quality are very rare. Hands down one movie that everyone regardless of religion, language and nationality must watch.  Without a doubt it's a work of art that is jaw dropping.",1460851200,,869,5.1571428571428575

In one scene, that lil' girl is seen comforting a kid goat, in another, she is chomping down on animal carcass with gusto.  And this movie claims to have a moral message...?  There is none, but it is replete with strong hints (both implicit and explicit) patronizing and encouraging the normalization of animal abuse.",1455321600,,443,4.88

7445427,3,B015NPMZA4,"I thought it was OK, but its over-the-top sentimentality detracts from the performances and plot.  It was hard to accept Salman Kahn as being so nave.  After all, he is nearing 50.  So it's hard to accept his wide eyed ""aha"" moments.  The little girl is charming, and it's worth the price of admission to see her.",1447372800,,313,4.43859649122807
7445428,5,B015NPMZA4,"This was my first Salman Khan movie and I found it to be a superb piece of cinema. Highly emotional without being overly sentimental or maudlin, and with universally human story -- showcasing the best characteristics of humanity. The great visuals and sound track just added to the punch packed by the screenplay. Oh, and bring your crying towel, you won't be leaving here dry eyed. Even if you predict all that will happen, the unfolding story will still pull at your heart strings.

7445432,4,B015NPMZA4,"First, I am not a HUGE Salman fan, but I do like his movies. Although I liked this movie, I found myself at times feeling so frustrated with all the roadblocks (some literally!) he was encountering trying to take this girl back to Pakistan to her mother. I do know how risky that would be, but I tend to get too involved in watching the movies, lol! I also agree with the other reviewer that the little girl was the star of the show. And for all you romance fans, as for any romance between Salman's and Kareena's characters, that was minimal, but that's to be expected with the focus of the movie somewhere else. For those asking about English subtitles, I bought the DVD which does have English subs, but also under the ""Product Description"" for the movie it says it has English subtitles.",1446336000,7,791,4.462068965517242

8734113,5,B015NPMZA4,"Cant even figure out what to share about this movie. It hits so many issues with grace and humor, be it India/Pak relations, caste bigotry, religious bigotry, human trafficking, border issues, police brutality, politics vs. justice, heavy handed corporal punishment (parent to child), learning disabilities (Shahidas lack of speech), failure of educational system (Parwan was obviously trying his best. One doesnt fail 10 times unless theres some type of learning disability. They should have caught that.) and so many other items.

But the movie makes its point without getting preachy or bogged down, losing the main plot. This is thanks to a fantastic script, wonderful cast and great directing/editing.

Though its sentimental, it isn't cheesy. Knowing what I know of the India & Pakistan police, the beatings are not exaggerated, either. When you see Salman all bloodied and beaten at the end, its believable. Its one of Khans best movies, if not THE best.

AWESOME to see Adnan Sami leading the Qawwali group in Pakistan. So happy they used a Pakistani singer for that part. Just made it an extra sweet touch.

I have watched this movie several times now and I still tear up at given places. And full on weep when Shahidas mum sees her running towards her.

Khan plays his gentle character perfectly, but Malhotra--even silent--steals the show.  Both actors relate well to each other, and their camaraderie feels genuine.  The plot is touching, serious, and heartwarming.  Overall, it's a fantastic movie.",1500249600,,498,5.1625
