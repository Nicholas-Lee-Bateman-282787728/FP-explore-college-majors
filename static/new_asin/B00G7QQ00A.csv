6067650,5,B00G7QQ00A,"Loved the camera work, enjoyed the story line. Wonderful to watch and the story draws you in.  Well written!  You can watch it alone or with a room full of friends and laugh your ass off together!  Just watch and see for yourself.",1392768000,2,230,4.3023255813953485
6067651,5,B00G7QQ00A,"The actors are spectacularly funny. The difficult situations in finding and admitting that you love a person that my not be viewed as ""normal"" by ""society"" are beautifully portrayed in this jewel of a movie.",1392768000,2,207,4.942857142857143
6067652,3,B00G7QQ00A,"There is more than plenty written about the story,so I won't bother adding to that,and spoil the movie for you. I don't watch Asian films,for the simple reason that I don't relate to much of the goings on. Then there's the ""music"" and out of control action,that continues without end. So,my 3* Rating is about how much I enjoyed the movie ,rather than how much people who like this kind of stuff would enjoy it. The never stopping action,for seemingly little purpose;reminds me of the saying,""it's like watching a Chinese fire drill"".
 Throughout the movie,I was reminded of a Korean friend of mine. He knocked himself out laughing at any joke I told him. I often wondered if he got it or not. So,sometimes I'd purposely mess up the punch line,and he'd still laugh. I once asked him,how come he never tells me any Korean jokes,and his answer was,""When you live in Korea,nothing's funny. Guess what? I'm going to pass this on to my friend,I'm sure he'll laugh very hard,and later I'll ask him what was funny;if nothing else,I'm sure his answer will be.",1390176000,,1051,4.711956521739131

Advertising executive Jason's first generation Korean-American parents are convinced that Jason will die if he isn't married by age 30, so when his fiance Jenni abandons him at the altar panic ensues.  Jason's parents move heaven and earth to find him a bride in the few short months that remain before his 30th birthday, resorting to blind dates and even TV game shows.  They even arrange an utter disaster of a blind date for him while he is on a business trip to Korea, where he meets the woman of his dreams.  Their courtship continues online, Jason proposes over videochat and the lovely Na Young flies to Los Angeles . . . . . .

As it turns out, Na Young is not quite what Jason pictured.  Jenni wants Jason back.  Jason's family is frantic for a wedding - any wedding.  Who will win the day?  You'll have to watch the movie.

Grandma's $0.02 - 98 minutes of rollicking good fun.  Highly recommended!",1390089600,,1117,5.284090909090909
6067654,5,B00G7QQ00A,First full length release from indie filmaker Christine Yoo.  The film takes a hilarious ride through romance and a family curse.  It's got all your crazy family members in to keep you laughing.,1389657600,,194,4.848484848484849
6067655,4,B00G7QQ00A,"""Wedding Palace"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Jason, a Korean-American living in California with his extended family, including parents and uncles and aunts who are all 1st generation immigrants from (South) Korea. As the movie opens, we get to know Jason and the background behind a family curse that goes all the way back to the 1700s in Korea. As it turns out, Jason simply MUST marry by age 30, or he'll die. When Jason is stood up by his bride-to-be Jinnie on their wedding day (in a scene strongly reminiscent of ""The Graduate""), he must renew his search for a suitable bride, with an assist from his parents. Then one day Jason travels to Seoul on a work project, and he gets to know Na Young, a beautiful and funny co-worker. Separately we see how Jinnie realizes her mistake and she wants Jason back. At this point we are about 35 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one whacky and zany rom-com, and I mean that as a compliment. The pace of the movie, in particular the first 20 min. or so, is at breakneck pace where you barely get time to absorb what is going before the film shifts to the next scene. Second, the movie contains a number of observations on the Korean-American community that are obvious without ever being mean or rude. Check out the overbearing parents (I love the ""Pick Your Bride Show"" scene), but also the multiple references to karaoke, materialism, etc. I'm sure that there are many others that likely went over my head (I am not Korean-American). At one point, someone makes a comment about how all Korean-Americans are stuck in the 1970 and someone else responds: ""Of course, that's when they all left Korea!"", ha!

Kudos to writer-director Christine Yoo, in her full-length feature debut, as she brings us a thoroughly enjoyable rom-com and family comedy set in the Korean-American community. However, let me be clear that you do not have to be of Korean descent to enjoy this. I know I had a smile on my face for much of the time while watching this. ""Wedding Palace"" is definitely worth checking out!",1389052800,17,2205,4.608142493638677

6067680,3,B00G7QQ00A,"I liked the Na Young character -smart, charming, independent.  At one point she calls Jason a coward.  He was, yet his conflict with himself and his family felt very human and real.  I think that's why I continued watching despite the flaws in the movie.  The movie's pace was slow overall, with frenetic interruptions.  About 15 minutes should have been cut.  The writing was flawed in several areas. Most of the women are portrayed as infantile and hysterical, as if manipulation is the only way for them to have a voice in the conversation.  Most of the men seemed less than grown up. The cartoon was odd and distracting, as was the women in the large hat, at the hospital, going on about the curse.",1475366400,,702,4.568
6067681,2,B00G7QQ00A,Too stereotypical.  The girl's singing is terrible.  Believe she is lip syncing. Parts of it are not realistic. The main character is non reactive most of the time. Over the top bad acting.,1474934400,,189,4.696969696969697

The only reason I didn't turn this film off in the first 5 minutes or less was that I became preoccupied doing things around the house and frankly forgot about it. I did give it a quick run through with the fast forward and stop button and found it very painful to watch.

6067927,3,B00G7QQ00A,"In this Korean-American crossover film, we see the aspects of cultural asymmetry  expressed by not so subtle discrimination based only upon the opinions of others. It's the old standby: ""WHAT WILL people say?"".  This film pushes the envelope a bit, holding back until the last 10 minutes or so, when some additional information is detailed, by one of the family members.  The comic moments weren't particularly alarming, but there was a great deal of screaming, sighing, hand-wringing and pseudo tears,  all part of the entire film. It seemed some woman or man-maybe several at one time, were pushing the panic button repeatedly, to emphasize their general hysteria.  Not exactly laugh out loud stuff, but not stilted or boring.  Actually, once I got past the initial tension-filled moments, I really enjoyed this film's premise and segues.  Good stuff.  The soundtrack is killer, music I had never before paid any attention to, but I found the toes tapping and the fingers drumming in synch to the tunes.
One issue alone drops this otherwise charming film from 4 stars to 3.  That was the sound track of the actors voices, when the most meaning needed to be crystal clear:  their mouths were moving with supposed dialogue, but the overall quality sounded to me as if there was just a tiny glitch in the post production taping and voicework. Rather like they were speaking through some sort of filtered sound processes with dubbing.  It wasn't distracting, but it sounded strange enough that to me, it became tedious.  IF this was dubbed in post, it's fine, but I did notice that one odd quality.

Otherwise, a delightful, charming and quite enjoyable cross over from an unexpected source.  I totally recommend this film. No profanity, no F bombs, just good clean fun. A rarity in any film, these days.",1432857600,2,1802,4.904290429042904

I will say this is not a move to watch in a loud, boisterous crowd, or with company.  The dialogue is what makes this film and is worth hearing, but it can be hard to hear with background noises.

The beginning is interesting and funny, with the celebration of a baby boys first anniversary. It was funny until a family member decides that the boy is cursed, according to Korean tradition because he chose to grab a feminine pad instead of a bowl with rice, money, or something to write with, as part of a traditional birthday ritual. The next scene shows a sort of Korean ""exorcism"" that took all the fun away from the movie. It did not make me laugh, it scared me. So, I turned it off.

When a business trip to Korea finds Jason meeting and having one date with a girl he met at work, after returning home the two end up growing closer and more in love, via phone and internet, to the point where Brian proposes and she agrees to relocate to Los Angeles for the wedding.  But a very surprising twist may throw the entire marriage - and Jason's life - into turmoil, in a funny, sweet and endearing romantic comedy exploring culture and family ... and firmly anchored by the charm of its male lead in Tee (along with a brilliant cast), who proves he can handle romantic comedy as deftly as the more dramatic - even sinister - characters he normally plays.",1416873600,5,1086,4.42

It uses multiple media, lighting, sound and sometimes over the top humor mixed in with tender moments.  Even the wacky ""tongue in cheek"" cultural jabs well suit this gem.  Just waiting for Grandma's LA swagger is well worth it... brilliant.

My hat's off to the folks that came up with it... and the actors that brought it all home.

Silly, bordering on the ridiculous, Korean, Asian, PG for a few words, feel-good ending, peppy, not so off-the-mark hyperbolic humor for how many (immigrant AND Other) families are thinking... and you don't have to worry about what's going to happen to the characters!

I normally give Five Stars to anything I like and One to that I think shouldn't be made to begin with; Chick Flicks are best when there a Four Stars; otherwise, it means you have to THINK!  And that's NOT why we watch Chick Flicks!

I was a little leary about the idea of the family freaking out because the bride is not what they expected her to look like - but the script doesn't justify what some may see as predjudice.  A few scences are slow.  But overall, it is an original storyline with some smiles, some chuckles and some laugh out loud moments.

The film is NR but would likely be PG or PG-13 if it were rated.  There is one scene in the animation and another scene at the wedding (both occur in the first 10 minutes) that parents may not find suitable for children because of the crude/suggestive humor in these two scenes.",1397260800,13,681,4.2890625

If the man was that swayed by such a thing, I wouldn't want him for my husband anyways. I can't say any more without making my comments a ""spoiler"".
