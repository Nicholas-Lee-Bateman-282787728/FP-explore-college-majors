8625222,5,B00GNZSUFS,"Shahid  is a great tribute to Shahid Azmi, the activist lawyer who paid the price for defending a man accused of terrorism.
A simple and beautiful film about a remarkable man, all the reviews and the prizes that the film has received are justified. However it may not be an easy film to watch. It mainly targets the Indian judicial system and supposedly trades a jibe by accusing it of making assumptions without any evidence against terror suspects.
At times, one is tempted to assume that the movie has a bias but I differ because this is simply an attack on the weakness of the justice system. A justice system that places the accused in custody for an indefinite amount of time without the lack of evidence.
This remarkable film is about Shahid Azmi, who himself flirted with radicalism in his youth but was disillusioned by it,  he runs way from a terrorist training camps in his youth and decides to become a lawyer and help fight for people who have been failed by the justice system repeatedly. He spends a few years in Tihar Jail on charges of plotting against the state but the court releases him due to a lack of evidence. Azmi realizes that there are many such people in Indian jails that have  been jailed due to a lack of evidence and they have no one to fight on their behalf. He works for a law degree and gains as many as 17 acquittals which is astonishing because the Indian justice system is known for taking its own sweet time resolving cases. There are so many reasons to like this movie....
Hansal Mehta deserves a standing ovation for making  a movie that is not only thought but absorbing. The tight editing and performances are worth mentioning. While Mehta deserves an applause, the actor Raj Kumar Rao deserves a bow..for a performance that will blow your mind away. This young man is blessed with the gene for acting and while he may not have the physical presence, Rao more than makes up for it with his gestures and facial expressions. I loved him in Kai Po Che and Queen but this role will be one of his best ones. Shahid is a film that would have been flat out boring had it not been for the direction and the acting.
Realism can be depicted and Shahid is proof of that. It needs and deserves approval. If you are a fan of intelligent heartfelt passionate cinema then you absolutely must watch this film.

8625224,5,B00GNZSUFS,"Every so rarely often Indian studios create a film that takes a hard look at any one of the many issues that that country faces. The other 95% of Bollywood is debilitating junk being sold to a poorly educated audience. This film follows the life of Shahid Azmi, a Muslim who after a brief experience with a militant training camp, becomes a lawyer who advocates for Indians railroaded by a corrupt police/legal system. Well acted, directed and scripted story of his life and the cases he counsels.",1396656000,,497,4.724137931034483
