7948607,5,B00005OCJR,"As an avid movie collector (at the tune of over 700+ unique titles), this set jumped out at me as these are modern classics. I won't comment on the content of the movies, as others have already done this, and their reputations speak volumes. All being great movies and getting them in a superbit collection for such a low cost (around $10 i believe) is reason enough to pick up this set. Recommended to anyone working on a high quality movie collection.",1375747200,,453,4.536585365853658
7948608,5,B00005OCJR,"Odds are you're reading this and wondering about Superbit and not about the movies themselves. If you just wanted the movie you'd just get the normal movie and save a few bucks, so I'll address the Superbit stuff here.  Can you tell a difference? Yes. Is it dramatic? Sometimes. Sound quality is remarkable but only if your home theatre can render sound extremely well. On  normal TV speakers you won't hear a difference. Picture quality is notably better *sometimes*. For example, in the Fifth Element during the taxi scenes or when LeeLoo is being reconstructed, or in Crouching Tiger in many of the outdoor scenes. Since Superbit by definition uses the entire disk for enhanced picture and sound, there are NO DVD extras included. For Fifth Element this is no different than from the regular DVD because it has no extras. Crouching Tiger is a different story. You may want to own both as the standard DVD is chock full of extras. If your DVD player is a computer, you'll need PLENTY of speed and memory to play these at full quality.",1019260800,38,1036,4.686813186813187
7948609,5,B00005OCJR,"Two of the movies included are fabulous, one is reasonably entertaining.  But, you can read a review of these movies anywhere. I am giving my recommendation for this particular DVD set and the format.  The picture and sound quality literally blew me off my chair.  Above and beyond the quality of even the best DVD's I have seen, including Criterion collection discs of other movies.  You won't get a lot of ""extras"" (scenes, bios, etc.) on these discs, but you do get the best experience watching the movie bar none, period, with these discs.  If you spent the money on a surround sound receiver and large, flat screen TV, spend the money on these discs to justify the other, larger investments in your Home theatre you have made.",1006732800,36,731,4.6796875
