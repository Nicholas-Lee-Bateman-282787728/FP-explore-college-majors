5344700,5,B009KOR30C,This was an excellent continuation to the series. I only wish they would get into the errors made in the King James also; yet that would start pointing to how the harlot to the whore was started and grew.,1363219200,2,204,4.256410256410256
5344701,5,B009KOR30C,"So, far I've viewed approximately 2/3 of the dvd since it runs close to 3 hours and is a documentary - giving many resources and interviews with many professionals in their theological and related fields. I would definitely recommend this movie especially to those who are more studious.",1362355200,3,287,5.0
5344702,5,B009KOR30C,"I watched the first DVD in the series called The Untold History of the Bible, I could not believe what I was seeing & hearing so I went to my local library, checked it out & found it all to be true.  Tares Among the Wheat was the next episode so I just had to have it & wow, just as good, Everyone should watch these videos. Now for the bad news, I have to wait 2 years for the next episode.",1362096000,3,391,3.768292682926829

5344705,5,B009KOR30C,"Outstanding! More history on the bible and the people that were killed for their love of God and His word. Much more on who and how certain people tried to stop God's word altogether. Excellent second part to A Lamp in the Dark - The Untold History of the Bible, the full version is actually on you tube.

5344706,5,B009KOR30C,"This DVD documents the battle between true Christianity and false religion.  It details the dilemma, throughout the centuries, for Bible believers and the desire of Bible deniers.  This DVD labors to comprehensively present the battle over the Bible.  This DVD is well produced and thoroughly researched.  It contains quotes from men directly involved in the issues as well as interviews by men who are experts in this field of research.  If you have not seen the first two then you must see this one.  If you already own the first two, then you need this DVD for you collection.  I am glad to own these and will communicate to friends and acquaintances the value held in this series.

It answers these questions;

How did the Catholic church start?

Where did the Pope come from?

How much power does the Pope have?

Does the Bible support the role of the Pope?

Does the Pope support the Bible?

Is Catholicism based on the Bible?

Who are the Jesuits?

Where did the English Bible come from?

What is textual criticism?

Where did textual criticism come from?

What role did the Catholic church play historically?

Where did Sinaticus come from?

This DVD deals with history that is largely overlooked by a populace that is misinformed.  It would do the curious reader well to investigate their curiosity.  You will be amazed at what you will uncover.",1351641600,107,1354,4.766233766233766
5344707,1,B009KOR30C,"Protestant arguments that deny that the Apostle Peter was the first Bishop of Rome (the Pope), completely denies Christ's mandate to Peter, ""Upon this Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail"".  The fact that Jesus took Peter outside of Judea and into the Roman outpost to have this discussion is also completely missing so as to make their case.  They instead say, falsely, that the first Pope sprang up in 606 AD...which is ludicrous.  The first church council of Nicea was held in 325AD in which Horsius of Corduba was acted as the Popal Legat (representative of the Pope - aka the Bishop of Rome).  There were five other church councils, documented in history that give proof of the unbroken line of Popes from St. Peter.  Furthermore, the Roman Catholic church is the only church with an unbroken line of Popes to our current Pope Francis.  So to call the church the Whore of Babylon that rises up in the end of days is not only ludicrous, it's probably more like the pot calling the kettle black since the Roman Catholic church can document it's existence with actual archeological facts back to 70AD, a good nearly one thousand, five hundred years prior to the Protestant reformation",1518134400,,1216,4.685446009389671
5344708,1,B009KOR30C,"There are one billion Catholics in the world today and this so-called documentary goes out of its way to offend them with outright lies and half-truths. This film is anything but objective.  Religion is not composed of perfect organizations because it is controlled by the egos of men.  The early Christians spread their Faith from Palestine to Antioch to Rome. It eventually became the faith of the Roman Empire.  Henry VIII wanted a male heir so badly that he gave up his Catholic faith and started the Church of England. He ignored his marriage vows and was consumed with the lust of women and power. Henry killed his wives in the Tower of London.  The Pope would not annul his various marriages so he ordered his men to take possession of all the churches in the English Empire.  Priests who refused to swear allegiance to the Crown and the authority of Henry were beheaded. The producers of the ""Tares among the Wheat"" conveniently ignored that.  They quoted Winthrop's ""City on the Hill"" but they neglected to say that his Pilgrim possie slaughtered all the Indians that helped the Pilgrims survive that first winter in America.  The Pilgrims killed the Indians and stole their land.

The Protestant Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland and attacked the city of Drogheda.  The English slaughtered the Catholic defenders and many of the inhabitants. Much evil is done in the name of religion.  Calling the Catholic Church the Whore of Babylon is disingenuous to all the evil done in the name of the Protestant Religions.  You say that your faith is based on the Bible but who actually wrote the Bible, God or men?",1518134400,2,1613,4.787003610108303
5344709,1,B009KOR30C,"Why does this ancient compulsion to call for the destruction of Roman Catholicism carry on in the 21st century? One reason is the love of conspiracy theories. Another is the righteousness of evangelical and other Christians. A third is hatred, that this stuff allows hateful people to openly hate and feel good about it. A fourth is a need for victimhood that many true believers feel they must carry and curry. There is also the success that all of these bring to people who believe this stuff in groups. It sells though I myself am not sold.

5344712,5,B009KOR30C,"Ultimately, there is one thing that no man can make a forgery of; the spirit of God. It changes you, gives you love to spare and to share; not fear(2Timothy1:7). You must search and pray, and be willing to submit to God's will(James1:5-8). I believe the Bible is full of truth, but regardless of how carefully it was maintained or craftily it may have been altered, God is the source of all truth, and The Word is written in our hearts, not in a book. *Scroll down to ""JUMP TO HERE"" for useful insights into The Holy Bible and Jesus Christ's Church.*
The narrator has a hard time going more than 3 words without halting; it's very distracting, since most of the 3 HOURS is narrated.
It is VERY LONG, and it seems like many of the topics and people that they discuss are interesting but not really important to the focus. Long quotes, from books, newspapers, or personal letters are taken as gospel for some and not for others.
SPOILERS!!!
If you want me to save you some time, The Papacy was created for accruing and sustaining power; they have gradually taken greater and more desperate steps to discredit and mislead(forgery, torture, persecution, murder, subversion, spying) those who believe the Bible alone is the Word of God and to lead people back to the church universal(apparently) because the Pope was the vicar of Christ, literal mouth piece of God on earth. People found out, say they found out, or say they forged manuscripts; and of course the Church universal and allies suppressed and attacked those people.
Basically, it's a very long conspiracy theory. If you are Catholic, you won't like it. If you are a protestant, you might like it. Basically- Revelation 17:1 The ""woman of loose morals"" of the earth is the roman Catholic Church is the moral of this movie.
It seems like the bulk of the 1:30-2:30 is spent on information, that may be more palatable watching the  BBC documentary ""Codex Sinaiticas"", which they actually use some of the film of to try and punctuate their point that it is THE most altered and the oldest complete manuscript(discovered in an Egyptian monastery in 1859, some fragments were acquired in 1844, by Von Tischendorf), but most similar to the Codex Vaticanus ie the master Bible in the Vatican{which they also assert is supposed to be 4-5th century but appears to have been written over and decorated in the 15th century when it was introduced into the Vatican library, making it's age hard to verify}) ); meaning that the Bible couldn't be the immutable word of God... Which is the protestant doctrine of Sola Scriptura. Jesuits are the main group insinuated to be the driving force on the cloak and dagger operations(Think NSA, CIA, KGB, Stassi... all rolled into one but from like, 7th century until now).
I really wanted to get something out of this movie. I feel like it had some potential, but it wastes a lot of time on conjecture and speculation with references from a time period that slander and liable were really not a stoppable thing, and it seemed like all the sources were sourcing off each other.
*JUMP TO HERE*- There is one faith, baptism, and Lord. If not the Catholic Church, then which one has authority to baptize with water like John, and Fire like Peter, James, and John? If it exists, we can find it. These are some of the things I've found in The Holy Bible to indicate His Authority may be present:  (In no particular order)

5344713,1,B009KOR30C,"I watched the entire piece.  I gave it a chance.  No one can criticize me for having failed to do so.

This piece, like its prequel A Lamp in the Dark, may well be the most offensive, malicious, bigoted, hateful, biased, insulting, slanderous piece of anti-Catholic drivel I have ever had the misfortune of encountering.  I could go into great detail, but I am writing a review, not a critique.

Those involved in creating this appalling tripe owe the Roman Catholic Church, Roman Catholics, and any and all viewers and potential viewers a profound, public apology.  Indeed, if they possess even a shred of honesty and integrity, they will at the very least publicly acknowledge how one-sided their propaganda is.  I will, of course, hold my breath.

I recognize that other reviewers feel differently, and I support their right, with all respect, to do so.  I hope they will extend to me the same courtesy, but will not be surprised if they dont.

ADDENDUM

I am amused.  My review was listed among the Top Reviews.  For about 12 hours.  Then it was removed and buried amidst the other reviews.  I would wonder why, but I already know the answer.

SECOND ADDENDUM

5344729,1,B009KOR30C,"Anti-Catholic propaganda- what century is this?  Full of hatred and prejudice, the likes of which characterized the world of the Crusades, granted, but no longer does.  Equating the Pope with the anti-Christ, referring to the Catholic Church as the whore of Babylon, heretical, etc. is preposterous.  I speak not as a Catholic (I'm not) but as someone who's been researching differences in faiths, Protestantism vs Catholicism, Judaism, etc.  I'm HIGHLY suspicious of any approach that fosters hatred and suspicion of others- psychologically, why would they do that, if not out of hunger for power and money, er, greed?  ""Don't join THEM, join US.""  The Catholic church doesn't do this (I know, I've watched EWTN extensively, read the Pope's papers, etc.).  Sure, there has been corruption in the Catholic Church in the past, just like the majority of other churches, human beings being as flawed as they are.  But the Pope is going to very great lengths to eliminate it entirely (he was a tireless fighter of corruption in Argentina), precisely why he was elected.  Jesus implored ""Love thy neighbor"", and this is the central message of the Catholic Church today, it seems to me.

The filmmakers and supposed scholars are committing the very same offenses they accuse Catholics of.  Take this with a rather large grain of salt- full of utter baloney, like declaring that the Catholic Church hates the Bible and seeks to eliminate it.  And BTW, it was protestants who removed whole sections of the Bible (seven books), not Catholics.  Martin Luther was not entirely successful at convincing others to remove everything that contradicted his beliefs, however, for example, the earliest book of the Bible, containing the testimony of Jesus's half-brother James:

""It is a well known fact that Martin Luther detested the New Testament letter of St. James, principally because the contents of this work contradicts the extreme position that he and certain other Protestant leaders took in insisting that a person is saved by ""faith alone.""  Luther went so far as to add the word ""alone"" in his German translation to the text of Romans 3:28 in order to substantiate this claim. However, the letter of St. James insists that faith without [good] works is dead, that is, it is not authentic faith. Since Luther was unable to convince others to remove the letter of St. James from the New Testament corpus of writings, his solution was to relegate it to an inferior position of authority by claiming that the author of this letter was not an apostle and therefore not binding upon Christians as was the case of Pauline writings. This is nonsense.""  (from Fr. John Echert, on EWTN dot com).

Bible history is fascinating stuff (to me, anyway), but instead of partaking of material that breeds discord and malice, I'd rather watch something enriching, uplifting, which demonstrates cooperation and areas of agreement, as well as CONSTRUCTIVE dialogue between Catholics and Protestants, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Common-Ground/dp/B01L37E8BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Common Ground</a>.  It's wonderful- in it, a Catholic priest and a Protestant minister discuss salvation, grace, good works, etc.  Or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Convinced/dp/B013SLNRV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Convinced</a>, which features conversion stories and details reasons why people became Catholic.  Both are illuminating.  And there's nary an ill word to be said of others.  As an aside, I've also seen/read a number of things that detail former Catholics' conversion to Protestantism.  What I've noticed is that when people cross over, in either direction, they inevitably say that what had become stale for them came alive in a new context (for example, their love of Jesus).  Catholics and Protestants have much in common, but worship in different ways, different strokes for different folks.

In a nutshell, this production is too biased, disingenuous, negative and nasty- the antithesis of Jesus's ministry.  It won't fill anyone with light and love.  Why bother?",1489449600,11,4138,5.496050552922591

5344799,1,B009KOR30C,"Right from the beginning the major flaw is exposed when the narrator raises the false dichotomy of Bible as ""merely"" a collection of myths and stories, vs the ""sacred word of God"".
MYTH  IS  SACRED!!
It is the fundamental basis of all scripture.
Those who attempt to make the Bible the ""inerrant"" word of a white English speaking bearded sky God atrociously degrade and reduce the scripture to a simplistic superstitious literary fallacy. The depth of meaning within scripture is tossed in the trash by childish Christians of this ilk.

Although production value is fairly high, the CONTENT of this film borders on atrociously ignorant and fallacious, anachronistic foolishness; a colossal failure in critical thinking coupled with fear of the unknown. It shows how far an argument can descend into irrelevance when one begins with a faulty conclusion, and then backfills the argument only with evidence that supports that conclusion.

Backwards.

That faulty conclusion is of course the idea of an ""inerrant"" scripture. Somehow the producers (and all fundies like them) never seem to comprehend that a search for literary inerrancy must always end with placing their faith in men, not God.

The content of this film can be dangerous to untrained minds because it completely mis-identifies and mis-characterizes what Protestantism really was (and still is), thoroughly distorting 500 years of western history, in addition to cynically pitting Catholics against Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Evangelicals, etc, etc, etc; not to mention promulgating the ridiculous notion that all faiths other than Christian must be ""wrong"".

Rome would love this development

Protestantism was not a movement to challenge the theology of Rome. It was rather a movement to challenge the PRETENDED temporal power of Rome over every conceivable government and people and individual. Pinto (thus Buchanan) conveniently ignores this 3000 pound GORILLA in the room because it would take the wind out of his hopeful sails, as the ardent desire for many modern ""protestants"" (and thus apparently his desire) is to once again replace the hated Roman theocracy with a new Christian theocracy.

Jealousy is so ugly.

Thankfully, we live with a people-owned government that guarantees freedom of religion, not a tyranny based on majority; we enjoy freedom of religious expression of any (non-harmful) kind, and do NOT entertain or support a government whose principles can be influenced by ""only one faith"". This relegates any religious ideas to opinion, which is where they belong. It is no longer necessary to expose theological forgeries or to ""prove"" which scriptures are ""accurate"". Biblical literalism is already an anachronistic irrelevancy.

These irrelevant anachronisms escape the minds of the producers due to their entrapment in the false dichotomy they establish.

Such arguments lead them to the further conclusion that the Papacy and Holy See must be filled with ""evil Luciferians"", which of course is another tiresome, veiled and scurrilous attempt at conflating Freemasonry with error, instead of realizing that Freemasonry actually protects the faiths of all (including Christians!!) and tirelessly promotes political and religious freedom for all; for the first time IN HISTORY removing the influence of ecclesiastical ""authority"" from civil authority. Government is NOT ALLOWED freedom of religion!

Again, Rome would indeed be proud. The idea that she is ""infected"" with diabolical ideas of ""freedom"" and evil religious equivalency is exactly the excuse they need in attempting to forcibly remove freedom from the rest of the world. Citizens must never allow this.

Today's modern (theocracy bent) Protestants are only too eager to follow lock-step with this movement, sending us back to the Dark Ages",1458950400,4,3837,5.470389170896785

I am an atheist so I don't take sides but there is no evidence to support any of ideas and opinions being presented here. If statements are made then their should be impartial representatives from both sides of the arguments to defend each side of the  issue. Statements are made by individuals as if they were facts but they are just dogmatic opinions. Most Christians are Christians because they were born in the west, most Muslims are Muslims because they were born in the east. Few people every have the courage to challenge their beliefs and demand the truth whatever the consequences. Just repeating what you have been indoctrinated with and then looking for evidence to support your beliefs is not seeking the truth. The only way to find some sort of truth, is through the null hypothesis. That is all assertions are false until proven by multiple independent sources to be true. Question authority don't be brain washed by the propaganda that is fed to you by a particular culture. Nietzsche said that believers are happy but doubters are wise.  Do you want to be comforted by fables or would you rather try and understand what we can or can't know. The Bible is  a questionable document that should be assumed a spiritual allegory not a factual historical document. The old testament is a Jewish document that was included to bring the Jews into the 1st century developing faith that was to become what we call Christianity. The new testament has no actual documents that date beforre the 4th Century AD and so 300 years of shenanigans were taking place and nobody knows what the original life of Jesus was really like. He surely wasn't anything like the figure described as that is a mythological figure that share many of the characteristics of Apollo and Mithras.

My complaint is that the narration was very annoying to listen to. The narrator can hardly say more than a handful of words before pausing. Pausing can be very effectively used to make something clear, to emphasis or create anticipation. But when every few words are followed by a slight pause, without any modulation in ones tone, pitch, pace or power throughout an entire 3 hour documentary, then it becomes a mannerism that is very distracting. I just had a difficult time listening to the message given. The interviewers and other spoken words are fine.

If you go into this thing with the idea that the Catholic church is an evil organization that has perverted Christianity, you'll come away with plenty of reinforcement to your ideas and will likely think this is a great film (if you can tolerate the length and the rather laborious pacing). On the other hand, if you're looking for a balanced look at the history of the development of the Bible, the Catholic church's role in shaping the evolution of the Christian faith, and the like, this entire thing will come across very much like a very long political campaign ad, full of vaguely unsettling music and unsavory appearing Catholic figures, replete with conjectures beginning with ""could it be possible"" that are normally reserved for ancient alien pieces, and in general a completely biased hit piece against the Catholic church and the Jesuits in particular.

This also reveals God's Truth on a coming ecumenical movement spearheaded by the Pope. This unholy unity goes against God's word and teaching as we draw closer toward the end times.  I love how they discussed the history and then offer biblical scriptures on the truth of God's word. Roger Oakland is very much a Godly man who loves the Lord, and gives clear biblical clarity.
A must see if you want to know the truth about organized religion of the Catholic faith and how they have killed, cheated, lied and have done anything to maintain their self deceived high ranking status among the world today.  They can be saved if they repent and trust only 100% upon Jesus Christ who offers salvation by His blood He shed on the cross.  They are so deceived to think they can be god and change God's true word to fit their religious schemes and not promote the Bible which means ""Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth,"" and they are doing all that they can to deceive the masses and their end will be in hell for their false teachings!
I'm so grateful that the DVD exposes the evil that is behind it all!

I am not Catholic - I don't want to comment on that aspect of the contents.  What I do want to say is that what is said in the film about the origin of the modern Greek New Testament is a complete fiction.  Because that portion is untrue, the remaining contents of the film are rendered suspect as well.  It is so bad that I was unable to finish it.

If you want to learn the truth, may I suggest:

Harold Greenlee's, The Text of the New Testament (http://www.amazon.com/Text-New-Testament-Manuscript-Modern-ebook/dp/B009M6TD1A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422546002&sr=8-1&keywords=greenlee+the+text+of+the+new+testament);

James R. White's, The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust Modern Translations? (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=james+r.+white+kjv).

If you have some knowledge of Koine Greek, read Greenlee's, Introduction to New Testament Textual Criticism (http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-New-Testament-Textual-Criticism/dp/0801046440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422547205&sr=8-1&keywords=harold+greenlee+textual+criticism).

Also, watch instead [...].

It is high time for Christians to educate themselves on the topic of textual studies.  I am a very conservative Protestant.  I agree with the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy [...].  See the signatories [...] - these are Bible-believing, Scripture-loving people, not heretics.

There is an excellent lecture series on iTunes U by Dr. Daniel Wallace (do a search for CSNTM or go to [...]).

Learn the difference between an original language manuscript and an original language text (printed and eclectic - this includes the Textus Receptus in all its differing editions, the Majority Text, and the United Bible Societies Greek New Testament).  Learn the difference between an original language manuscript and a version (not in the original Hebrew, Greek & Aramaic).

Would you be able to offer any help to someone who had been disturbed by the writings (or lectures) of Bart Ehrman or somebody like him?  Study and learn the facts for your own benefit and so that you will be able to help others.

Another Chris Pinto classic! Conspiracy abounds along with the usual denigration of all other Christian denominations than his own, which by his definition makes them demon worshippers. Not content with condemning those followers of Jesus who do not take the Bible literally, he practically calls Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Shintoists pagans. There seems to be no limit to the hate this evil bigot has in his heart for humanity at large.

Pinto holds back from directly stating (although in this 3-hour dirge I may have missed it) that the universe is around 6,000 years old, though his derision of the evidence that bones can be millions of years old or that there is any credence to Darwinian theory is a good indicator of the way that he leans on the matter.

I strongly recommend that concerned citizens watch this video  or as much of it as your stomach can take.

I will provide the summery of the debate by TurretinFan which you can find on Alpha and Omega ministries website.

Chris Pinto vs. James White  Debate Summarized

The Chris Pinto vs. James White debate on whether Codex Sinaiticus is a modern forgery can be boiled down to a few considerations.

1) Constantine Simonides claimed that he wrote the document based on collating pre-existing manuscripts, and that his uncle corrected the document.

Both sides agree that he so claimed. Dr. White demonstrated that these claims are essentially impossible, as explained below.

2) The most sympathetic source for Simonides says that Simonides was not a truthful person.

Dr. White raised this point, and Pinto did not dispute it except to say that this source was not the only supportive source and that the source himself says Simonides did not always lie.

3) There are no known examplars that could have been the source for Codex Sinaiticus.

Dr. White raised this point, Pintos response was to point out that the source(s) could be as-yet-unknown manuscripts on Mt. Athos.

4) Codex Sinaiticus was written by several different, distinguishable scribes (as evidenced by different handwriting, different style of abbreviations, and different accuracy of work).

Dr. White raised this point, Pinto did not respond to it.

5) Codex Sinaiticus has corrections by multiple different correctors.

Dr. White raised this point, Pinto did not respond to it except to say that two other men (a monk and a scribe) may have been involved in the corrections.

6) The amount of time necessary for collating multiple manuscripts of the entire Bible (plus some apocrypha) would have been prohibitive in the timeline proposed by Simonides.

Dr. White raised this point, and Pinto responded that possibly his uncle started on the project years before Simonides began.

Additional notes:

1. Regarding the Mt. Athos manuscripts, there is an on-going digitization project (link). At one point, Mr. Pinto alleges that the one way to resolve the mystery was to explore the Mt. Athos library for manuscripts corresponding to Simonides claims. He won't be able to stand behind that argument from ignorance forever.

2. Simonides himself states that the collation began after Simonides himself joined the project, as demonstrated by Dr. White. So, although the uncle allegedly had corrected the other manuscripts in advance, the collation project had not been done in advance, according to the primary source for Mr. Pintos theory.

Conclusion

The fact that the manuscript was written by several different scribes and was corrected by numerous additional hands makes it impossible for Simonides story to be true. The necessary hypothesis would be that Simonides deliberately altered his handwriting several different times during the writing of the manuscript to give the impression of different scribes. Such a hypothesis is simply implausible  there is no reason for Simonides to do this for the purpose of creating a text for the Czar (as he claimed).

The fact that collation of documents takes an enormous amount of time, especially when one of the documents is not in the base language (allegedly one of the manuscripts was a Syriac manuscript), also weighs against Simonides claim. While it might be conceivable that such a collation could take place, the necessary time and training for such a collation to be undertaken are simply not there.

The fact that the supposed exemplars of Sinaiticus do not produce the unique readings of Sinaiticus and the fact that some of these unique readings are found in later discovered papyri also weighs against Simonides claim.

In view of these facts, its hard to see how anyone could come to any other conclusion than that Simonides was not the scribe of Sinaiticus, whether or not Simonides actually did create a manuscript intended for the Czar.

-TurretinFan

P.S. I hesitated to post this, because I felt like the debate was unusually one-sided  it did not seem that Mr. Pinto had really any reasonable response for any of the questions posed to him or that he made any notable points that were difficult for Dr. White to address. Thus, I was afraid that my comments would look like piling on or kicking Mr. Pinto when he is down. However, since Mr. Pinto has apparently been misunderstanding silence from Dr. Whites friends as a lack of support, I thought it prudent to briefly summarize why the debate was so clearly a victory for my friend.",1389657600,10,4529,5.067385444743936

For nearly 2 thousand years...the world has been turned upside down....over what can only be called...the most controversial book...of all time.  To its critics...The Bible...is merely a combination... of myth...and legend...mingled with history.

I think anyone that watches this documentary has to walk away feeling concerned that many if not most of the evangelical churches today are studying using bibles (modern versions like NIV, NASB, NET etc) whose foundations (the Westcott and Hort Greek ""Critical Text"" based on Sinaiticus and Vaticanus) have been compromised by Rome. The exposure of the faulty logic, deception and omissions of the BBC documentary about the Codex Sinaiticus alone is worth the price of this documentary. I also thought it interesting how leading scholars admitted to dating manuscripts based on ""instinct"" rather than scientifically which in my opinion is no different than a guess. I don't think it is a question about if Rome was involved but rather to what extent and I'm puzzled as to why many modern day scholars are reluctant or derelict in connecting the dots.

Another interesting section in this documentary is the detailed discussion about all of the forgeries that Rome has foisted upon the world and how Codex Vaticanus which was earlier rejected by  Erasmus, ""suddenly"" became relevant thanks to the ""efforts"" of the Jesuit Cardinal Angelo Mai.

I cannot overstate the importance of this documentary if you are interested in bible history.",1366848000,75,1327,5.050228310502283
5344966,5,B009KOR30C,"This is the sequel to 'A Lamp in the Dark'. This video was definitely more than I expected. Why? Because it gave the history of the two manuscripts that are often used in Biblical Scholarship circles today: the Vaticanus and the Sinaitiucs. The history of these two manuscipts are explored in this video, and I doubt you will find this information in many seminaries. Another character is discussed in this video: Constantine Simonides. Who was he? You will have to watch the video to find out! Various articles on the internet have him as a forger, but the scribes lied about Jesus too! When it is all said and done, is the Bible that you use Wheat or a Tare? I can tell you this, if your bible is based on the Vaticanus or Sinaiticus manuscripts, your bibles are tares. If you sincerely look for the truth, God will show you.",1365465600,31,827,4.483443708609271
8542578,5,B009KOR30C,"All sides, in any controversy, will always have a bias. The question is not whether or not a bias exists. The question is; #1 is the references legitimate and #2 is the evidence real. If both #1 and #2 are verifiable, then are the conclusions both logical and reasonable. It is important not to skip steps #1 and #2, and go straight to answering the question of the conclusions are logical and reasonable, since a person will be basing that solely on their preconceived notions of things.

Truth should always be more important than satisfying ones own bias, and so with this in mind, I tried to spot check references cited in the film, and so doing I chose the three below sources at random.

* The World Parliament of Religions of 1893
* The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order by Jacopo Leone 1846
* The Secret History of the Oxford Movement by Walter Walsh 1899

I was able to use an online resource to verify the above books and read their content; and found that the quotes and excerpts used in the film are indeed accurate.

Not everyone will agree with the conclusions found at the end of this film, since some of the conclusions include some calculated speculation on their part, but I think that the film makers did a fantastic job presenting verifiable source information to try and support their conclusions.

Hopefully this review was helpful to some.",1529625600,,1376,4.622950819672131

8542582,1,B009KOR30C,"Wow, very wrong history of the early Christian Church from the perspective of Protestants who claim the Church starts in the Reformation.
The first ""court"" or Council of Bishops was Biblical, when the Apostles (bishops) prayed to the Holy Spirit for guidance to replace the chair of Judas.  They eventually voted to cast lots between two disciples.  Under the head of the Chair of Peter, the ""Rock"" that Jesus placed at the leadership position of his New Covenant Church to spread the Gospel.

Also, The Chair of Peter is in communion with other Chairs (popes of other Cathoclic Rites) under Apostolic Succession.  It is the bishops' authority handed down through apostolic succession that Catholics of all Rites recognize, not the city of Rome.  Haters, lol.  Just proves that Jesus' teaching of how to spot a wolf by their ""fruits"" is the best way to discover His shepards.

Protestants, please get your history right before you start bashing Christianity!",1526428800,,958,5.025316455696203
