5274172,4,B0096QO3LG,"I bought this as a Christmas present for a fan of the series.
And unfortunately, it isn't a ""box set"" (I know that's not explicitly stated in the item description, but one assumes).

It's basically four Bluray boxes shrink-wrapped together.

The price is unbeatable mind you. Still much cheaper than actually buying all four Blurays separately.

But the collector in me is a bit disappointed that it isn't in a unique box set.",1353283200,3,426,4.808219178082192

8536908,2,B0096QO3LG,"THE HOSPITAL MASSACRES

Directly in the path of the invading Japanese hordes lay the Princess Alexandria Hospital in Singapore. Guarded by a detachment of Ghurka troops they were ordered by a Japanese officer to lay down their arms. The Ghurka NCO replied that this was not a military target but a civilian hospital. Angered by their refusal to disarm, the Japanese officer ordered his men to seize and kill two dozen of the Ghurkha guards. This order was promptly carried out and the Nippon soldiers then entered the hospital. The wholesale slaughter which followed defies description, sick and dying patients being butchered in their beds. Some were just shot, others clubbed and bayoneted and not a few were beheaded by the sword. A number of the victims were survivors from the Prince of Wales and Repulse. The scene of carnage resembled an abattoir, disembowelled patients sprawled everywhere. Doctors and medical orderlies were then killed as were the nurses who were first raped in a most brutal fashion. A similar atrocity occurred in Manila when the Headquarters of the Filipino Red Cross in General Luna street was captured. Some seventy civilians, sick patients and a number of children were put to death in the same brutal and sadistic way. In Burma, on the afternoon of February 7, 1944 an Advance Field Hospital was overrun by the Japanese who first wiped out the protective guard of West Yorkshires then killed every doctor and medical orderly they could find. The sick and wounded were massacred where they lay after their personal possessions were stolen. In all, thirty-one patients, nine orderlies and four doctors were brutally put to death. After the Japanese takeover the city was renamed 'Shonan'.",1409616000,,1720,5.056338028169014
8536909,5,B0096QO3LG,"Purchased these as an addition to my growing movie collection. They arrived quickly, well packaged, un-damaged & exactly as described. The movies that I received were brand new & sealed.
I enjoyed 1 & 2 more so than 3,4 & 5 (separate purchase). The latter movies were rather redundant & some\\\what predictable.",1404777600,,311,5.0
