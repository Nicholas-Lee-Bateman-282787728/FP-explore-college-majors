1736585,4,B00006ADDG,"Many of us die-hard slasher fans have been waiting very patiently for this set! The Sleepaway Camp series is notorious for its unforgiving cruelty and off-kilter humor, and for good reason. This series is essentially what the other famous series of the time wanted desperately to be. It knows it's bad, and it takes a slap on the hand proudly. Unlike many other slashers, All of the teens who bite it deserve whatever they get, and the surviving heroine always indeed deserves to survive. Angela can and will always be viewed as a sadistic & endearing femme fatale anti-hero. I love these movies and gladly accept them into my collection with a sigh of relief. Finally, the wait is over!",1029801600,,687,4.733333333333333
1736586,5,B00006ADDG,"This is the one to get!  By far, one of the all-time BEST box sets around.  Not only do you get all 3 of the SLEEPAWAY CAMP classicks, but if you hurry and pre-order from BEST BUY (US), or FUTURE SHOP (CANADA), then you get a DELUXE-LIMITED EDITION box set with a 4th disc!!  It contains all of the production footage from the never-completed SLEEPAWAY CAMP 4: THE SURVIVOR!!!  Part 4 was started and abandoned back in '96, and for the first time you can see what could have been!  A true collector's item!!  You can tell if the box has the 4th disc by a large glob of blood on the front stating that the extra disc is contained inside.  Plus (for all you Canadians out there), if you order from FUTURE SHOP's pre-release, you'll get it before it's released!!

Sleepaway Camp Trilogy has been one of the funniest productions in my life. It has a lot of humor, fun and imagination (great make-up effects) that cannot be found in another camp slashers. With this price, this trilogy is a must for all campers. Don't forget, when you go camping, just take the essentials...",1029456000,,413,4.914285714285715
1736588,4,B00006ADDG,"The ""Sleepaway Camp"" series has long been known as a ""Friday the 13th"" knockoff by many mainstream critics.  But to fans, this series is so much more.  From its shocking and haunting finale of the original, to the pre-""Scream"" self-mocking style of part 2 (""Unhappy Campers"") to the full-circle feeling of part 3 (""Teenage Wasteland"")... the ""Sleepaway Camp"" series has grown quite a devoted cult following.
Anchor Bay Entertainment (aka the Horror Fan's Best Friend) has issued a boxed set of all three ""Sleepaway"" films.  Featuring new cover art and a collectible booklet, this set is a must have for any fan.  Here's a breakdown of what all three movies include:
Sleepaway Camp -- Feature-length commentary by director Robert Hiltzik, star Felissa Rose and moderator Jeff Hayes; theatrical trailer.
Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers -- Commentary with director Michael A. Simpson; behind-the-scenes footage; video trailer; still galleries.
Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland -- Commentary; behind-the-scenes footage; deleted gore scenes; video trailer; still galleries.
The only complaint would be that the original movie is the same disc that was released in 2000... a non-anamophic transfer with no additional extras.  But the extra footage on the next two films is a real treat for any fan, providing a rare inside look on the making of these classic films.

2 Not a horrible sequel. Maybe you can consider this an improvement over the first but it is still rather boring and uncreative.
3 This is my favorite one of the series. It is actually pretty funny. The same killer, Angela, attacks people for no apparent reason with a log. It is so bad its good.",1027987200,,433,4.228915662650603

With three films all enjoyed in their own ways, the Sleepaway Camp trilogy has acquired a pretty massive following. And it deserves it.

This box set, with it's eye catching cover, nifty sliding out box, humorous sleepaway camp ""diary"", and even the horrid unfinished production footage of sleepaway camp 4 - is definitely something worth looking into.

The first Sleepaway Camp actually makes an attempt at being a serious horror movie, and does a decent job. The following two movies don't even try. They know what they are and they flaunt it: Entertaining but not scary, needs gratuitous topless scenes, typical early 90's horror. And there's nothing wrong with that!",1220486400,,391,5.030769230769231
1736639,4,B00006ADDG,"The first movie ""Sleepaway Camp"" deals with two relatives Angela Baker(Fellisa Rose) and cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) are spending time at camp Arawak. It may seem like paradise for fun and sex for the other kids, as strange accidents and murders occur as a maniac is on the loose for everyone especially the owner (Mike Kellin) including a few campers must find out who is this killer. Next ""Sleepaway II and III"" deals with the mysterious maniac from the first movie has been released from an institute to be counselor of Camp Rolling Hills and the killer doesn't like it when they get into trouble as the killer uses anything like firecrackers, lawnmowers, guns etc.

Three fun and entertaining horror flicks for any horror and slasher fanatic! the first movie is a disturbing and shocking slasher pic that was considered a ""Friday The 13th"" and ""Halloween"" rip-0ff became a box-office sleeper in november of 1983 because of it's shocking scenes of violence like a memorable scene where a pedophile chef gets boiled by hot water literally and the movie packed one hell of an ending that haunts people to this day. The sequels on the other hand are meant to be dark comedies with a little bit of satire like the second one for example makes fun of other horror movies of that time like ""Scream"" did in the 90's and the third one was weak but good especially for that sexy Asian babe with some good death sequences with Pamela Springstein in both 2 and 3.

This DVD boxset contains all three movies all nicely transfered with good picture and nice sound even though the first movie isn't completely uncut, but you can find that in a cheap 4 buck DVD to see the uncut version of the original. The extras are terrific like trailers, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage and outtakes, a booklet with info on the movies, and a 4th disc which contains 45 minutes of unreleaed bootleg footage of the 4th ""Sleepaway Camp"" which was never made but luckily for fans of the series, the REAL 4th movie comes out later this year.",1214611200,12,2047,4.683333333333334
1736640,4,B00006ADDG,"1. Sleepaway Camp - Not your everyday camp slasher film. Homosexual undertones, the issue of teen sexual confusion, and pedophilia are all running through this film, with a hella shocker ending. However, this isn't the uncut version.

Here are what is NOT present in this version.

1. Several frames of Meg's corpse have been removed.
2. Judy flipping the bird back to Ricky during the game of Capture the Flag.
3. A lot of frames of the watersnake slithering out of Kenny's mouth are missing.
4. A shot of the boys skinny dipping is also missing and is overdubbed with a weird howl.

This disk has a commentary by director Robert Hiltzik, moderator Jeff Hayes (of sleepawaycampmovies.com), and actress Felissa Rose. This disk also features the theatrical trailer.

2. Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers - A spoofy, self-aware parody of 80's slasher films has our favourite transsexual psychopath Angela (a few woman now,) working as a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills and ""sending campers home for bad behavior.""

This disk features the trailer, a small teaser trailer for Sleepaway Camp 3, a making of featurette, and a commentary by director Michael A. Simpson, moderator John Klyza (of sleepawaycampfilms.com), and writer Fritz Gordon.

3. Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland - Features Angela making mincemeat of more immoral campers.

This one is a real treat. You get a making of featurette, the trailer, the deleted scenes with the original uncut deaths, and a commentary by director Michael A. Simpson, moderator John Klyza (of sleepawaycampfilms.com), and writer Fritz Gordon.",1206057600,11,1589,5.159533073929961
1736641,5,B00006ADDG,"The Sleepaway Camp trilogy is one of the most overlooked horror franchises in the history of cinema. The first film stars Felissa Rose as a troubled young girl with a mysterious past named Angela Baker, who arrives at summer camp with her cousin. However, things strange things begin to happen at camp and it becomes clear that Angela could be responsible. The truly shocking ending will have you gawping for hours afterwards. The second and third installments in the trilogy are much more tongue-in-cheek and star Pamela Springsteen - you guessed it, Bruce's sister - as the older Angela, freshly released from the mental hosptial where she has been incarcerated for years. Soon Angela is up to her old tricks again, this time directing her anger towards teenagers that she thinks deserve to be ""punished"". Springsteen plays the role for laughs and the effects are tremendous.

1736642,5,B00006ADDG,"The Sleepaway Camp series changed the slasher genre for good. Out of all the great slasher flicks that were produced in the 80's this series really holds up, Even compared to today's slasher movies. Yes, it was inspired by ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"". But i think the original movie surprised audiences with it's infamous shock ending that they never forget and has some creative kills, the sequels are more comical at times compared to the semi-serious first movie. But they are enjoyable sequels in a silly way with some slight gags to other horror movies and good splatter effects, if your into slasher movies with a comical twist then i suggest you buy this boxset and have some fun.

The set includes a bonus disc of production footage from the never completed ""Sleepaway Camp: Surviver"".

Coming later this year will be two more ""Sleepaway Camp"" movies, can't hardly wait!",1200096000,,884,4.886666666666667
1736643,3,B00006ADDG,"Well, I've already reviewed each Sleepaway Camp Individually. So this review will pretty much deal with the packaging of this ""Survival Kit"" as its called. First off, like my title indicates, this set does NOT include the fourth disc. But believe me, I have the four-disc set, and promise you, its not worth it anyway!! And I am really puzzled that the set that contains 4 discs in actually cheaper than this set. This set is way overpriced!! Anyway, as far as the movie quality you're getting here, eh...not that great. This first Sleepaway Camp is pretty good, but the other two sequels get increasing worse, as they go into a entirely different direction as far as horror movies go. Now each movie has Director's Commentary. The first one, again, being the best, since it also has the original Angela, played by Felissa Rose. The other two commentaries for Sleepaway 2 and 3, I couldn't bare to sit through cause the moderator, some guy from a fan website, (God only knows why the hell they would put him on the DVD), sounds like a complete moron, and there is no commentary by Pamela Springsteen on either sequel. The fourth disc, which is nothing more than production footage from an abandoned Sleepaway Camp 4, makes me thankful that this project was abandoned!! All it contains is take after take of boring crap, nothing important what so ever. The disc also has a ""trailer"" to the fourth film, which is one of the worst things I've ever seen! Horribly stupid!!! So, like I've said before, if you're wanting the Survival Kit with this fourth disc, believe me, you're not missing a thing!!! Now as far as packaging, this set is actually pretty cool. It comes with a little Sleepaway Camp diary, yeah, kinda cheesy, but still, pretty cool. All the films fit into a sturdy holder that slides into the case. For mainly this reason, I'm giving this set 3 stars. If you're a die hard horror fan, like myself, this set is worth having. But I wouldn't pay as much as they are asking for it on here. You can find it cheaper elsewhere!!",1189987200,2,2033,4.603305785123967

like how the survival kit was set up. There are also commentaries

1736656,3,B00006ADDG,The biggest plus of buying the boxed set is the box itself! It looks really cool in the shelf and the red ink that simulates blood is even sticky. The first movie is a good slasher with preteen actors (this means no nudity). the last 10 seconds of the movie will stick with you for a long time. Second and third parts SUCK!,1161043200,,323,4.142857142857143
1736657,5,B00006ADDG,"When I first saw the Sleepaway Camp boxset  on Amazon.com I was a little skeptical.  The only Sleepaway Camp film I had seen prior to that day was ""Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers"" .  I enjoyed the second Sleepaway Camp but would the others be as good?  After seeing the price I decided it was worth the $23.00 and ordered it.

  Four days later I got the boxset in the mail and my wife and I sat down to review all three movies.  We decided to watch all three from the beginning, starting with the original.  I had no idea what I was in for.

  The first Sleepaway Camp film starts off with a boating accident that made me laugh so hard my testicles ached!  It just gets funnier from there.  As the movie progresses we are introduced to other characters: a child molesting camp cook, a camp owner named Mel (who bares a striking resemblance to a fish/monkey crossbred offspring), a rambling, psychotic, overbearing mother, a strange, wide-eyed, mute girl...and the list just goes on.

  In my opinion, what makes this movie so funny is the actor Mike Kellin (the Fish-Monkey).  His face and physique alone make me want to laugh out loud!  He literally looks like a Fish-Monkey!  On top of that he's got quite a temper.  There is a scene where Fish-Monkey is interrogating his ""murder suspect"" (a boy named Ricky).  After a slight barrage of questions (and an ever increasing suspicion) he decides to grab the child and scream the following lines of dialogue in his face:

  "".....you killed them to destroy me, didn't you!  DIDN'T YOOOOOUUUUU?!""

  That's when I almost went unconscious from laughter.  I was in hysterics for about five minutes.  If you have seen the movie you know what I'm talking about, if you haven't...trust me, it was funny as hell.  The way Fish-Monkey draws in his breath to scream that final ""DIDN'T YOOOOOUUUUU?!"" is so comedic.  You can see his lungs fill with air, he looks like he's going to fall over and have a heart attack.

  Later in the movie (after discovering more bodies around the camp ground) Fish-Monkey decides to put an end to his suspect's murderous escapades by casually sneaking up on the boy and then beating him to death with his bare hands.  Again, I just about fainted from laughter.  This poor boy is just trying to enjoy a candy bar when this insane old man bitch slaps him to the ground and proceeds to pummel him to death with his monkey fists, all the while screaming at the top of his lungs, ""LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAAAAR!""

  The second Sleepaway Camp film is very funny as well, along with enough female nudity & gore to keep viewers interested .  Very funny film.

  The third installment ""Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland"" is decent but doesn't compare to the it's two predecessors .  It's obvious scenes with a lot of gore were cut short, it really takes away from the film.  Still it makes for fair entertainment.

  This boxset is a must for any fan of the slasher film genre!",1142899200,2,2946,4.603481624758221
1736658,5,B00006ADDG,"The first SLEEPAWAY CAMP film begins with two young children, Angela and Peter, out on a lake with their dad, John. There is a horrible boating accident, and John and one of the kids is killed. Eight years later, the surviving child, Angela, is now 14 and living with her cousin Ricky and aunt Martha. Angela is painfully shy and hardly speaks at all. The two kids are headed off to the summer camp Arawak. When they get there they meet some people who don't take well to Angela: Judy, a pretty and stuck-up bitch, and Meg, a councler who is creeped out by Angela's tendancy to stare at others and not say anything, and annoyed by the way she doesn't participate in any activities. Then Angela is assaulted by Arty, the dirty, perverted cook. Ricky comes in the nick of time, and Arty chases them out. Later while Arty is cooking ears of corn over a big steaming pot, someone sneaks up behind and pulls the chair out from under him and making him fall in. Arty is horribly burned and taken to the hospidal. But then other members of the camp who were mean to Angela start getting knocked off. Is the killer Ricky, who always wittnesses when someone is cruel to her and acts out in her defense, or is the killer Angela herself? (If you've read the other reviews or description of the sequels, you probably already know the answer, as well as the film's final shock twist.)

In SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2: UNHAPPY CAMPERS, it's four years later. Angela (O.K., yeah, she's the killer in all the films,) has been rehabilitated (or so they think,) and is now working as a camp councler at camp Rolling Hills, where the campers consist of about two middle-school boys and 37 high school students. Angela wants to be friends with the campers, but there are some-particularly the eight girls who she's directly responsible for-who have bad attitudes and nasty habits, like doing drugs and having promiscuous sex. So Angela starts bumping off the people she deems bad campers.

In SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3: TEENAGE WASTELAND, Angela kills and takes the identity of another girl so she can go back to summer camp once again. There are eleven other teenagers there, both rich and poor, and three counclers. Of course, Angela meets people there who rub her the wrong way, and the killing begins once again...

Stuff in particular I liked: the trailer in part 1, the rock music in parts 2 and 3. Both Felissa Rose and Pamela Springsteen are wonderful as Angela. You have to feel sorry for the killer here, actually, since if only she'd had a better life growing up or could once come to a camp where everyone was well-behaved she could have gotten along fine. Certian scenes in particular in part 2 shows Angela really just wants a friend. And of course there are a number of good kill scenes as well. Also the characters are better fleshed-out, at least as far as slasher films go. The commentairies are fun to listen to, and Felissa Rose is one of the people who does commentary for the first film

Now for a few complaints: Angela is supposed to kill only those who are really mean. Yet there are some murders that seem unmotivated, at least later on in parts 2 and 3. Why did she kill Anthony and Jud, the two guys who dress up as Freddy and Jason? I mean sure they had that unwelcome party in the middle of the night with the girls that Angela wasn't happy with, but Molly, the girl who Angela really liked, was involved too, so that doesn't seem good enough. If it's because the boys wanted to scare the girls, well Angela scares them right afterwards dressed as Leatherface (she doesn't actually kill anyone right then, though) so that would seem to make her a hipocrate. Then at the end of part 3 she sets up a booby trap that kills two teens that weren't bad either, Angela just decided they were boring. My other complaint is that Pam Springsteen, who plays Angela in the sequels, doesn't do the commentaries for them. (She doesn't act anymore either, which is a shame.)",1141862400,3,3949,4.534361851332398

I mean...transvestites, mullets, bad acting, low budget, Camp, gore, funny kills, morals...I mean this is craptacular entertainment right here folks! Although the first one takes itself a LITTLE too seriously, the sequels are made to be a little cheesier. I tend to like the cheese, but the first one is just is funny because your supposed to watch it with a straight face. All I can say is that these are the ""sister"" movies. They star Melanie Griffith's sister in the third one, Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen's sister in the second one, and Bruce Springstein's sister plays the killer in both two and three. These are just good B movie fun. So gather your friends around and have a fun time just laughing away at them!

1736677,2,B00006ADDG,"The first movie:  A bunch of teenagers go to camp an the killing begins.  This one is just really boring and features some PAINFULLY bad acting.  Think of an R-rated version of The Bad News Bears and you'd come pretty close to what you've got here.  This movie uses actual teenagers, which immediately reminds you of why most movies use people in their 20's to portray teenagers - these kids look like they're about 9 years old.  The murders are only a slight diversion from the dullness.  I'll say this though - the last 10 seconds are the freakieast thing thing I've seen in a long time.

Part II - Unhappy Campers.  REALLY BORING.  This would be a typical teen slasher at summer camp movie (at least they use 20-somethings for the teens this time), but there's a twist:  the killer is the main character.  This is certainly no spoiler since you'll learn it right at the start of the movie.  The trouble is, this might sound like an interesting twist - in theory - but it just doesn't work in execution.  Slashers work because there's suspense - danger lurking around every corner.  But in this movie, you're around the corner, you see everything coming before it happens.  And it just doesn't work.  Pam Springsteen does a great job as the ethical, psychotic, and witty killer, and the movie has a great atmosphere, but the concept was too flawed.  There are also way too many killings, it's basically like watching corpses run off an assembly line.  With virtually no character development on the part of anyone except the killer, this gets tedius real fast.  After watching for an hour I was checking the display on my DVD player, and was thankful to learn that there were only 10 minutes left to sit through.

Part III - Teenage Wasteland.  Probably the best of the bunch.  Same exact plot as the second one, same flawed concept, same great atmosphere, but at least this time there are some interesting characters.  No character development at all (again), and the characters are killed off in order from most to least interesting.  But still better than the other two.  The dark humor actually kind of works in this installment.

Fourth disk - this is just endless takes and re-takes of a few scenes in a movie that was never made.  Very beautiful Fall scenery, but otherwise completely unwatchable.

All the movies have a commentary track, which unfortunately are dominated by some guy who apparently runs the Sleepaway Camp website.  I guess he's the biggest fan (in the whole world) of these movies, and he prattles on endlessly trying to impress someone (himself?) with his encyclopedic knowledge of banal trivia related to the movies.  It sounds as if the people who were actually  involved with the films - the writer and producer - are getting pretty sick of listening to him by the end of each commentary track.

Overall, these are decidedly below average films for the camp slasher genre.  There's no suspense and no menace, and they just don't work.  Pamela Springsteen does a good job as the killer, but she's just killing people we never got a chance to know, so we don't care.",1097366400,2,3096,4.682745825602969
1736678,4,B00006ADDG,"Every entry in to the Sleepaway Camp series is entertaining, campy, and bloody. What more could you ask for? Angela Baker, the male/female killer has some pretty imaginative tricks up her sleeves when it comes to slaughtering kids who come anywhere near Camp Arowak. And behind most of the killings is some sort of message (reminds me of South Park in a way); do not smoke marijuana, or Angela will soak you in gasoline and light you with your joint; do not have sex at camp, or you will be beaten with whatever Angela can find ie. a big stick. With a lot of the slasher movies of the 1980s we were treated to some very trite acting and poor plots. And with Sleepaway Camp, we get the same treatment, only with more gore and gratuitous nudity than most others in the genre (Slumber Party Massacre trilogy aside). Sleepaway Camp is obviously in the vain of the Friday the 13th franchise, which is not a bad thing. When all you want is to watch some decent kills, not have think too hard about what is going on, or maybe you are just tired of seeing a masked killer with not much screen time, well throw on Sleepaway Camp and just veg to classic 80s mayhem. It's too bad that Best Buy had the best deal for this box set which isn't as widely available anymore as it was ($29.99 plus free shipping with the scrapped Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor included as a bonus 4th disc). But don't worry, you didn't miss much if your box set doesn't have the fourth SC entry, the original three are where the fun is.

Also, keep an eye out for the new Sleepaway Camp due sometime in the near future featuring music by CKY (Camp Kill Yourself. Ha...ha)",1091059200,3,1639,4.3737704918032785
1736679,5,B00006ADDG,"Well... Anchor Bay has done it again!  This very cool box set of the cult classics - The Sleepaway Camp Trilogy has a cute ""first aid"" motif with bloody handprints on the slipcover.  The red paint used on the slipcover for the blood actually FEELS STICKY, like real blood! Open the slipcover up and you have pictures of first aid items like band-aids, first aid cream, gauze, antiseptic wipes and the like with the DVD's right inside. Utter PACKAGING GENIUS!
Also included is a ""Sleepaway Camp Diary"" that gives the history of all three films and includes addresses for cool Sleepaway Camp fan websites.
All three of the features are presented in widescreen with audio commentaries, still galleries, theatrical trailers, outtakes, behind the scenes, deleted scenes and MUCH, MUCH GORE!!!
You won't believe the odd cast list in these fun movies!  The first installment has a group of total unknowns with Felissa Rose as the shy, teenaged Angela. In the second and third installments Pam Springsteen (Bruce ""The Boss"" Springsteen's little sis) takes over the challenging, over the top role of Angela.  Also in the cast are Tracy Griffith (Melanie Griffith's sister)who plays ""Marcia"", Renee Estevez (sister of Emilio Estevez & Charlie Sheen)as ""Molly"" and even an Academy Award Nominee in Michael J. Pollard (Bonnie & Clyde, 1967)as a lusty ""Herman""!!!
The names of the characters are references to the pop culture for the times, with names purposefully taken from ""The Brady Bunch"", ""The Munsters"" and ""West Side Story"".
The real star in these three pics, however, is the special effects!  Great stuff, even compared to present day F/X.  The soundtrack to Sleepaway Camp II, ""Unhappy Campers"" has the likes of Anvil, Obsession, and even the Dead Milkmen!
Sleepaway Camp III, ""Teenage Wasteland"" is a very bold and different teen slasher movie as most of the ""slashing, hacking, stabbing and the like"" is done in the middle of the afternoon with the bright sunshine of Camp Sleepaway making the blood run ""redder than ever""!
If you enjoy The Friday The 13th series, ""Slumber Party Massacre"" films, ""Halloween"" movies, or other slasher movies in this genre, you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE Sleepaway Camp as it is really in a genre of it's OWN (don't wanna give away Angela's REALLY BIG SECRET, you know)!

In the case of this latest box set from Anchor Bay, you really can't ask for more. All three movies with bonus commentary and tons of added features not to mention a ""survival guide"" and bonus DVD in a deluxe package edition. How can you ask for more?
To be honest, I had only seen bits & pieces of the first ""Sleepaway"" when I purchased this boxed set but when I was done watching all three, I felt more than pleased with my purchase. All three movies are cheesy B-horror flicks similiar to that of FRIDAY THE 13TH.

1736684,4,B00006ADDG,"If you want to get all 3 films and a bonus dvd on making SC4, I recommend this because it'll save you lots of dough. I will briefly review all 3 films below
Sleepaway Camp: A GREAT slasher film, this one starts it all (it should've ended it all too) with a young girl named Angela who goes to a camp for the summer along with her cousin. She is painfully shy and everyone who messes w/ her or her cousin ends up dying in some creative way. Although it is never evident who REALLY is the killer in this one, you won't truly find out until the end and I must say the last scene in this film will make your jaw drop, it is just so unexpected and extreme! A great 80's slasher that may rip off Jason, but involves characters that can actually act and have personalities, ones you hate, ones you like. The dvd offers little extras but it's still ok, the movie makes up for it.
Sleepaway Camp 2; Unhappy Campers: Now this one's just silly. The film introduces The cute Pamela Springsteen as Angela from the first film who returns to become a counsler of a camp years later. This didn't even seem like a sequal but more of a spoof on the first film, which highly disappointed me. The music is silly, and the characters can't act and are only there to get chopped up by Angela, and the movie as a whole doesnt take itself seriously as the original did. The only good thing about this one is the very attractive female cast, including Renee Estevez (Charlie and Emelio's sister) as one of the campers, there's also some good nudity and a pretty dirty sex scene.
Sleepaway Camp 3; Teenage Wasteland: This is worse then the 2nd. The even cuter Pamela Springsteen again returns in this one as Angela who joins a camp of rich and poor kids set up by a couple of old people. This one takes itself more seriously then the 2nd but isn't as good, or shall I just say, it's worse. It still has cheesy actors, a predictable bland story, and bad special effects. What I also hated was the fact that the one hot slutty camp girl in it was killed off FIRST! Sure she got naked w/ some old guy (pretty unlikely) but it didn't even show anything past that, she was gorgeous, and it's a crying shame. The dvd does have a few features including a deleted scenes feature where it shows each death in the film but with the extra gore put in, it's like ""why didn't they just leave that in the movie in the first place??"" There really isn't anything redeeming in this movie except that in this one Angela has some pretty creative ways of killing off the characters.
If you've never seen this films before, I would only recommend buying the first film, it's the only one worth owning and the only one worth your money, the other 2 don't even belong in the $10 section of the store, they should be given out for free, but even then it's not worth it.",1044921600,2,2818,4.2790262172284645

7966201,5,B00006ADDG,"I fondly remember renting the first ""Sleepaway Camp"" with my cousin back in the day of Mom & Pop video stores. The movie was good, but the memory of watching it with my cousin is priceless. I purchased this box set when it was first released, but it's been sitting on my shelf unopened for at least a decade, and finally decided to pop it open and share these films with my son over the past rainy weekend.

""Sleepaway Camp"" strives to be a legit, standard 80's slasher, and even tosses in a mystery as to who the killer may be. The movie isn't very scary, but it's enjoyable as hell. The kills are pretty tame, and there is a lot of unintentional humor sprinkled throughout the movie. I really like the concept of this film, and the infamous twist when the killer is revealed. Lots of fun.

""Sleepaway Camp II"" takes off about a decade after the first film, and while the first film feels rooted in the 1970's, this entry plants it right into the middle of the hair metal 80's. Pamela Springsteen is on hand as a camp counselor that is determined to keep camping fun and wholesome even if it means killing off most of the campers. This movie is lots of fun, and full of inventive kills and laughs. Pamela Springsteen is really underrated, and her comedic timing is spot on. Chock full of blood and boobs, and featuring The Dead Milkmen on the soundtrack, this is the highlight of the series.

""Sleepaway Camp III"" takes place a year after the events of the second film, and once again Pamela Springsteen stars as the killer doing her best to share her love of camping. This year it seems that an older couple is hoping to use camp to help troubled youth. It's not long before the bodies begin piling up and the one-liners go flying. While not as good as the second entry, this third entry is packed with more of the same over-the-top fun you come to expect with this series.

If you are looking for scares, and thrills, keep looking. There are so many camp based slashers from the 80's that you're bound to find something more frightening than this series. But if you want some over-the-top fun and a movie to watch with a bunch of drinks and friends, you can't go wrong with this set.",1465171200,2,2186,4.403465346534653
