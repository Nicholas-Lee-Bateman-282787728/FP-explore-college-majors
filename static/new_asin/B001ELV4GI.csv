3555972,5,B001ELV4GI,"We LOVE this new video. My boys are 4 & 6 and I thought they might be a little too old for it. I decided to try it out anyways since they still enjoy the Baby Einstein videos so much, and they flipped for it! They sing and dance all over the house to it. It's perfect for both my kids because one is all ready starting to read, and the other one needs the practice learning reading words. It's filled with so much fun and entertainment, great pictures and story line. I would recommend this video to anyone, if fact I want to get one for every one I know. It will make the perfect Christmas gift. I even watched it the first time around with my boyfriend before the kids watched it. It was adorable and the theme song is extremely catchy. Can't wait until this company brings out more videos. We're so excited!!!",1221004800,10,812,4.211538461538462
3555973,5,B001ELV4GI,"This is an awesome dvd for babies! My daughter is a year and a half and had absolutely no interest in anything I put on for her to watch on tv. A friend recommended Monki See Monki Do and she was immediately hooked. She learned all her body parts and sings along to the catchy songs. She can already read the word ""baby"". It's a must have for any parent with young children!!",1220140800,4,375,4.1506849315068495
8298746,4,B001ELV4GI,The DVD is kind of old school & seems to be outdated BUT my son does enjoy the movie. So I can't complain too much.,1442275200,,115,3.64
8298747,2,B001ELV4GI,It took forever to load and was of poor quality.,1434326400,,48,3.9
8298748,2,B001ELV4GI,My kids (3 & 4) were bored stiff. I thought it would capture their attention because they love the Signing Times series and have the entire huge box set but nothing doing.,1408233600,,171,4.375
8298749,5,B001ELV4GI,"My daughter loves this video. She knows most of her body parts and many of the other words in the video. She is 16 months old. My pediatrician says she has the vocabulary of an advanced 2-year-old. I credited these videos with much of that. We have purchased her the whole series because she has learned so much and loves to watch them. The videos are simple but they are aimed at young children so it is appropriate that they are simple. Multiple techniques are used to teach each word, including pictures, live action, music, etc. We couldn't be happier with these videos. This video is the perfect start. And then build your video library with the other Monkisee videos. I recommend Around the House as the next one to get. The Action Words video is great when the child is old enough to start doing the actions with the characters on the screen. All the videos are good but if you're only going to buy a few, get those 3.",1387497600,,925,4.415204678362573
8298750,5,B001ELV4GI,I've tried exposing her to other fun videos but this one she absolutely loves!  I sing the theme song and she goes crazy.  We've been teaching her sign language as well since most people have told us that they can sign before they are verbal BUT my daughter is now verbal before she's signing.  She likes to try to say the words in the video as they say them (though she can't way them correctly yet but she's close).  Can't say enough good things about these videos!,1297209600,3,467,4.333333333333333
8298751,5,B001ELV4GI,I got the program for my gran daughter and as far as what I saw she says and repeats all the words. It maintains her interest and personally I found it entertaining. My gran daughter is just over two. I also purchased the other two Monki See programs and they also work very well. I would recommend it. But everyone is different.,1295308800,2,329,4.32258064516129
8298752,5,B001ELV4GI,"Wow, I am so happy that I got these DVDs!! MY baby LOVES them! I love that the DVDs have original poetry and music, and I also like the cute puppets! My son sits enthralled for the 30 minutes the DVD lasts and will dance and sing along when the theme song plays! He is learning so much from the videos. He now knows all his body parts and his colors!! I am really enjoying the fact that he can watch TV and be learning something!  This is a really awesome way to keep the baby entertained while learning!",1291334400,2,504,4.090909090909091
8298753,4,B001ELV4GI,"Although the quality of the video is not as good as baby einstein dvd, my 14 months old daughter still loves it and learn all of the names of the body parts... but still cannot recognize the words",1283731200,2,196,4.184210526315789
8298754,1,B001ELV4GI,"The idea for the video is a good one, but the production of the video is just bad.
You can make the same thing at home for a lot less money. The dvd has poor quality, sometimes it just skips for no good reason.
Do not buy it, save your money.",1271203200,3,242,3.764705882352941
8298755,1,B001ELV4GI,"I personally found this video to be quite useless. It cannot even keep my 22mo son's attention, and all he wants to do is watch videos.",1234224000,3,135,4.230769230769231
