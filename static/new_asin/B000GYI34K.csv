2622054,4,B000GYI34K,I loved re-watching the great history of the Baltimore Colts.  I used Disc 2 when I went out skeet-shooting.,1168128000,4,108,4.684210526315789
2622055,4,B000GYI34K,"I just purchased this and thought Disc one was fantastic.  Here is what you get on Disc 1:  A one hour documentary on the Baltimore Colts, the NFL Greatest Games Prsentation of the 1958 NFL Championship, and a series of small featurettes on Raymond Berry, John Mackey, the 1967 Colts etc.  In total, Disc one is about 3 hours long.

Disc 2 is about the Indianpolis Colts and I have no idea what is on it and I never intend to find out.  Shame on Steve Sabol and the NFL for forcing Baltimore fans to puchase this disc as well.  The Colts departure from Baltimore left a hole in my gut that never healed, but the folks at NFL Films don't seem to care.  Why they could not issue Disc 2 as a seperate presentation is beyond me.  By the way, because NFL Films decided to waste the second disc on the Indy Irsays, they left out the following:  highlight films of the 1959 & 1968 NFL Championships, the highlight film of the 1970 AFC Championship, the Super Bowl V film, and the season highlight films from 1958, 1959, 1964, 1968, & 1970.  They all exist and should be made available to Baltimore Colt fans.",1164240000,11,1101,4.326829268292683
2622056,5,B000GYI34K,"The first dvd is fantastic. It covers the history of the BALTIMORE Colts (1953-1983) and should be seen by every football fan. This dvd really shows what the Colts meant to that city, and what a great team they were. By the way, don't miss the extras: they alone are worth the cost of the dvds. In these extras there are excellent bios of the great Colts: Unitas, Berry, Curtis, Mackey, etc., plus a very well done story of the 1967 Colts, who were one of the greatest teams not to make the playoffs, and the 1958 NFL Championship in its entirety, which I think is the best NFL Films presentation of all time, and that's saying something.

The second dvd is very good too, covering the history of the INDIANAPOLIS Colts. Its extras are good too: including the Monday Night Miracle comeback and bios of Manning, Mora and others. I liked it very much, but Baltimore fans can be forgiven for using this second dvd as a drink coaster.",1163548800,32,930,4.470588235294118
2622057,5,B000GYI34K,"Just ordered. The first disk (Baltimore Colts) will be great, as any Baltimore fan knows. The second disk will never see the light of a DVD player. I have not followed pro football since the 1983 season, after which Robert Irsay took the Baltimore Colts to another city, whose name, when combined with Colts, still makes me shudder. I look forward to a stroll down memory lane with Johnny, Raymond, Lenny, Bubba, Gino, Alan, Tom, Bobby, Earl, Gary, Jerry, Jimmy, John, Art, Don, Ted, Weeb, Don, Mike et al.

Baltimore would get a grade of A and Indianapolis a grade of C+. But, if you're a Colt fan you'll probably love it from start to finish.",1428192000,,281,3.9473684210526314

2622131,3,B000GYI34K,"Harbaugh and the Colts of the mid '90s are dismissed as a one-year Cinderella story primarly. That's a shame because he wasn't Tim Tebow.  Instead of a feature on Harbaugh, we get Jim Mora? He's more a Saints guy. I'm also wondering why they didn't cover WHY the Colts moved to Indy. At least one sentence or two. We get nothing, only that we had a stadium for them and a rabid fan base. The unwillingness of Baltimore to build a new stadium was not mentioned in the Baltimore disc at all.",1404864000,,489,4.315217391304348

I PLAYED IT ON THREE DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND STILL NO PLAY. I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS HAPPENED TO. I WOULD HAVE PAID THE MONEY JUST FOR THE BALTIMORE COLT DVD BY ITSELF, IF IT WOULD HAVE WORKED. WHY THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THIS ITEM, I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I GIVE THIS A ONE STAR RATING AND THAT IS FOR THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS DVD. BUYER BE WARE. ONE UNHAPPY BALTIMORE COLTS FAN. I WANT TO THANK AMAZON.COM FOR ALLOWING ME A CHANCE TO GIVE MY REVIEW ON THIS ITEM AND MAYBE THE DEALERS THAT CONTINUE TO SELL DEFECTIVE ITEMS GET A BAD RATING SO CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BUY ANY OF THE PRODUCTS.

2622133,5,B000GYI34K,"Let me start by saying that I've been a Colts fan since the 1960's when I first became aware of pro football. I'll also add another interesting point. I'm from Indiana. Yep, that's right, and I was a huge Colts / Johnny U fan, and still am for that matter. Now, I think you know where this is headed. I thoroughly enjoyed the Baltimore Colts history. I love the perspective of the players from those great Colts teams. So I recommend this package for that disc alone, if you don't care for the Indy teams.

But, as offensive as this will sound to some old Baltimore Colts fans, I'm going to say it anyway. I also enjoyed the history of the Indianapolis Colts, and would also recommend this package based on that disc too. I still love the Colts and the Peyton Manning era. Those Colts teams also accomplished some great things. I'm also pleased that the Colts picked up Andrew Luck and look forward to amazing things from him.

So the bottom line is this: While I enjoyed the history of the Baltimore Colts more, I still recommend this package for the Baltimore, as well as the Indianapolis Colts. Get the package, sit back and enjoy it. You'll love the history of these two eras of Colts history. And you can't beat the price!",1398729600,,1227,4.448888888888889

2622139,4,B000GYI34K,"I enjoyed this 2-disk set a lot.  It's a very thorough and accurate history of the Colts, beginning with the origins of the team and taking us right up through the Peyton Manning era and the move to Indianapolis.  I was a little disappointed that this history was compiled before the Colts won their superbowl a few years ago, but I'm sure that will be included in future histories.

If you're a fan of the Colts then you'll definitely want to watch this video.",1371600000,,461,4.464285714285714
2622140,4,B000GYI34K,"For those who are old enough to remember the BALTIMORE Colts.....the SAME BALTIMORE Colts that put the NFL on the map.....you will LOVE Disk-1.  I cannot rate Disk -2 (Indianapolis) because I have not and will not watch it.  Having grown up with the Baltimore Colts.....and saw Unitas, Mackey, Curtis, etc......Disk-1 brings back GREAT memories.  I can also say, that having lived through 1984....I can TOTALLY understand how the people of Brooklyn felt when their beloved Dodgers were taken from them.....name....colors....the WHOLE shabang!!!  NFL Films should REALLY break this into two separate sets (one for Baltimore Colts and one for Indy).  Perhaps fans in Indy want to see pre-1984 footage....but I can guarantee that folks in Baltimore have no interest in watching footage post-1984.  If this was simply a Baltimore Colts DVD, I would have rated it 5-Stars!!!  Seeing pictures of Peyton on the back of the case, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  That is why I only gave it 4-Stars.  The BALTIMORE Colts DVD truly is EXCELLENT!!!",1368921600,,1037,5.052941176470588
2622141,5,B000GYI34K,"Whether you like the Baltimore Colts or the Indianapolis Colts, you'll love this 2 disc set. It includes the 1958 NFL Championship game and many of the great players of the 1960s era of the Colts. (Johnny Unitas, Jimmy Orr, Lenny Moore, Raymond Berry) The Colts are on the rise again thanks to Jim Irsay (Robert  Irsay's son). Robert Irsay who moved the team from Baltimore on March 29, 1984 is not well liked in Baltimore for his actions but Maryland should have built a state of the art stadium to replace the aging Memorial Stadium. The newly relocated Cleveland Browns tried in 1995 to get the Colts name etc. back to Baltimore for the new team. But the name Ravens was chosen instead. The new era of the Colts took shape with Peyton Manning, Reggie Wayne, Marvin Harrison and Dallas Clark. The Colts name and history should have stayed in Baltimore due to Pimlico but that's life!

2622146,5,B000GYI34K,This is an NFL films DVD. It is excellent. It is a wonderful source of history for those of us that loved the Baltimore Colts. Thanks to NFL films for making this a 2 DVD set. The Baltimore Colts DVD is cherished. The Indianapolis Irsay DVD was buried in the landfill where it belongs. Go Ravens.,1321920000,3,296,4.303571428571429
2622147,5,B000GYI34K,this dvd is super great even tho i thought they should have shown more highlights in the manning era and more special features on disc2. but other than that this dvd is great. if they had waited one more year to release this dvd would have had our 06 superbowl highlights but its all good. i luv the highlights of johnny unitas raymond berry lenny moore and other greats.

2622158,4,B000GYI34K,"The Colts are not my team, but as a fan of NFL history in general, I really enjoyed this.  The 1958 game, the 1995 season led by Jim ""Comeback Kid"" Harbaugh, and so much more span both of these discs.  For a Colts fan it is a must have, but even for a fan of the NFL one will find a lot of great footage, and a lot of stories that bring back memories of past games no matter what your age is.  The only downer to this set is that it was produced right before they won the Superbowl, so it is kind of bittersweet in the final few minutes of the 2nd disc how they speak of ""trying to get back there"" when in fact, they were just months away from reaching that very pinnacle.  Excellently produced, this is one of the better NFL team documentaries I have seen.",1236038400,,757,3.993377483443709
2622159,5,B000GYI34K,"Disk #1 is great!  Worth the price even though the second disk comes as a bonus.  If you were ever a true Baltimore Colts fan, you really need to own this DVD Set.  It took 15 years to become a Colts fan again as I really enjoy watching Manning.  Reminds me of the the days I spent biting my nails over what Johnny U was going to do next.  The second disk was OK until they gave a hero's recognition to Irsay, honoring that fat drunken lush in their ring of fame.  The best thing that man ever did was die and to honor him as some sort of savior was ludicrous.  Disk #2 is a true bike reflector!",1227916800,6,595,3.9495798319327733

2622161,4,B000GYI34K,"I really enojoyed the history DVD, it was brief in some era's but still gave a pretty good draft of important events throughout the franchise.

I was a little gunshy getting this DVD because I was afraid it would be too Indy based. But NFL Films did a wonderful job of separating the Colt eras. The 65 minute profile of the Baltimore Colts is fantastic. But what makes it even better are the special features, including the OUTSTANDING NFL Films profile on the '58 Championship Game. I will cherish the Baltimore DVD for the rest of my life. The Indy DVD is in the hands of a co-worker who likes the Irsay Colts (that still hurts), so we are both winners.",1171411200,12,668,4.528925619834711

I grew up with the mighty Indianapolis Colts and fell in love with the team during the Harbaugh era and of course am a huge fan today. Admit it, you can't help but enjoy the Colts of today.

2622189,3,B000GYI34K,"I finally gave in and ordered this DVD. I too was a big Baltimore Colts fan during the mid 1970's and was reluctant to order it. Reckon the curiosity was too much for me.

I get the feeling that disk 1 is mostly a compilation of clips from other NFL film productions, as i recognized a good chunk of the content. Were the interviews with the Baltimore players conducted for this DVD, or pulled from other productions?

Agree with another reviewer that by going with the two eras in one collection made disk 1 a bit skimpier than it should have been.

Some things I believe that they left out on purpose include how Robert Irsay came to own this team, and his general demeanor and actions prior to 1983.. in fact, I'm willing to bet there's no mention of him at all on disk 1!

Maybe they just were trying to keep the mood of the DVD as upbeat as possible. But why call the thing the complete history if you're not going to include some pretty major stuff?

I did however really enjoy some of the material from the very early years. There's some color footage of Don Shula running a practice session that looked like it was shot 10 years ago instead of 40!

I would have rated this 3.5 stars had i could of, but the proximity of Disk 2 made me go with 3 stars instead of 4. :)",1168387200,6,1275,4.204918032786885
