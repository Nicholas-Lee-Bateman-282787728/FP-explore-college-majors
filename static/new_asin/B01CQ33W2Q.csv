7688422,1,B01CQ33W2Q,"A curiosity, but hardly an interesting movie. Elmo Lincoln was no John Barrymore. Indeed, I'd rate him a couple of notches below Johnny Weissmuller. But given the times, the shoestring budget, the primitive technology, and the racial assumptions of the 20s, my low expectations were adequately fulfilled. Insofar as the movie is a peephole into another time I think it's worth the 80 minutes of my time.",1467417600,,403,5.029850746268656

7688425,3,B01CQ33W2Q,"WE turned it on as a matter of curiosity and ended up watching the entire movie. Not that it was real good, but we found it quite interesting, while comparing it to modern day movies. We've come a long way.",1466640000,,206,4.175
7688426,4,B01CQ33W2Q,Fun to watch but it is absolutely silent. Some movie music would help make it that much more interesting.,1464393600,2,105,4.578947368421052

Actual running time of this DVD is only 60 minutes. If this is truly a ""restored"" version, the running time should be at least 73 minutes.",1520640000,,293,4.745098039215686

8753709,5,B01CQ33W2Q,"I ordered this as a library item. I enjoyed Tarzan films when I was a small boy, and this disc evokes nostalgia. I especially love it as it depicts the environment and mannerism of those in the early 20th Century, and Tarzan as I believe he should be like  a, for want of a better phrase, half-savage.",1475712000,,301,4.280701754385965

8753711,3,B01CQ33W2Q,"Unless you are a rabid fan of Tarzan, you should skip this silent picture from 1919 with very poor picture quality, stock pictures of wildlife, and weak story. If you are a fan, like I am, there is a lot to like. Elmo Lincoln is the first screen Tarzan. He makes limited use of the famous grape fines, but walks and jumps on tree limbs like the Tarzan in the novels. Young Tarzan discovers clothing after years of nudity. The Amazon Prime presentation doesn't even have a musical score. If you are interested in movie history or just someone who wants to know a little more about the Tarzan phenomenon, this is worth your time. Otherwise, skip it.",1474156800,,647,4.491525423728813
