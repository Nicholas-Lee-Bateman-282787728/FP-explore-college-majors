While I only gave the first season a meagre 4 stars, season 2 were both 5 stars with each season surpassing its predecessor in laughs and clever script writing.  I have found season 4 to be following the trend of surpassing yet again the excellence of the previous season, and there's no doubt season 3 was excellent as well.  This show just brightens my mood every time I watch it. There are so many good episodes here.",1411948800,,525,4.371134020618556

3088292,5,B0012EM5E2,"If you liked Laverne & Shirley, you'll like this.  I loved the show when I was young, but it's a little silly to me now.  However, I still enjoy their antics.",1378944000,,158,4.064516129032258
3088293,4,B0012EM5E2,"I've loved Laverne and Shirley ever since I was watching them on TV Land when I was 12.  Now at 25, I love them even more.  As an underpaid working girl on the hunt for a good man, I find them that much more relatable.",1377216000,,218,3.8222222222222224
3088294,5,B0012EM5E2,"None of the previous seasons of Laverne & Shirley had any extras, so it was nice surprise to see a few included on this release. They really aren't plentiful, but it's good to see the effort made.",1370390400,,196,4.324324324324325

3088299,5,B0012EM5E2,I  think I was about eleven or twelve when the season originally ran.  Watching them again after all these years makes me feel like a kid again.  They are hilarious and have tremendous chemistry together.  They just don't make them like this any more :(,1361836800,,253,4.555555555555555
3088300,5,B0012EM5E2,"I have been collecting the seasons of Laverne and Shirley for over a year now, and each one is as hilarious as the next. I never grow tired of the slapstick mingled with the heart that the show inspires. The two girlfriends and cast members that interact with them...and sometimes STEAL the show...are a real mixture of the innocence and curiosity that WAS the late 50's and early 60's.",1343606400,,386,4.608695652173913
3088301,5,B0012EM5E2,Laverne & Shirley still the best.  Laughed as much now as then.  Throughly enjoyed this dvd.  Looking foward to purchasing the other seasons.,1330128000,,141,5.043478260869565
3088302,5,B0012EM5E2,"I bought this for my (down syndrome) daughter who has all the other L & S, DVD's available for purchase. She's really enjoying it, keeping her portable DVD player in the kitchen so I can hear her laughing while she's watching it. Anyone who is a fan of good clean humor would like this set.",1322179200,2,290,4.290909090909091
3088313,4,B0012EM5E2,"I remember sitting through Happy Days as a kid just to see these two girls. What great chemistry the leads had. Too bad ABC moved it to Thursday nights while the show was number 1. Whose ""brilliant"" idea was that? The show went down in the ratings and never recovered...even when it was moved back to Tuesdays. This season was full of great laughs. I believe the Night School episode and the Spy in my Beer are the best. HOWEVER, the classic Laverne and Shirley episodes can only be found in Season 5! The iconic episodes are Mosejaw Express Murder Mystery ""Beware of the bald man!"", Frank and Edna's Wedding (was moved to a Baptist church where L & S sing with the African American Choir, and of course Dead Laslo's Place ""Betty please pick up your hash blacks!"" . I truly hope sales of seasons 1-4 will lead to the release of Season 5 which is the difinitive season of Laverne and Shirley just before they moved to California (another ""brilliant"" idea...what were they thinking?).",1315180800,2,982,4.5852272727272725
3088314,5,B0012EM5E2,"I love Laverne n Shirley season 4. Where are the rest of the seasons. We want more, why do they stop bringing out the rest. These are great shows, Happy days is another they stopped at season four. Now the new crappy shows that are not worth a dime like Jersey shore come out so quick. It's such a shame.",1307923200,3,304,4.083333333333333
3088315,5,B0012EM5E2,Well sent,1304553600,,9,4.0
3088316,4,B0012EM5E2,Its great to watch all those old shows. Without these dvd collections for sale people would not be able to enjoy them when ever they want. I reccomend to anybody who liked this show to purchase all the seasons on dvd.,1299974400,,217,4.317073170731708
3088317,2,B0012EM5E2,"I would have really liked the DVD collection of their 4th season but even though this was a brand new DVD, the third disc was scratched so that it was not viewable.  Upon trying to return it, the third party seller had a 7 day return policy.",1277596800,,241,4.127659574468085

3088320,2,B0012EM5E2,"You have to be a fan of Shirley and Laverne to appreciate this not so funny video. Too much performing (dancing, singing, etc.) and not enough well-written humor as in the prior seasons. I actually found a few of the segments boring. Perhaps Cindy William's disputes and dissatisfaction with her acting parts affected the performance of this particular video. Would probably not be interested in purchasing any further produced seasons.",1229558400,2,436,5.242857142857143
3088321,5,B0012EM5E2,What's not to love about Laverne and Shirley!!  I could watch them over and over again.  Good clean comedy!!,1225238400,2,108,4.631578947368421
3088322,5,B0012EM5E2,"Laverne & Shirley is one of the best buddy-buddy shows of all-time. Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams had wonderful chemistry, too bad these women didn't get along off-set.

3322766,5,B0012EM5E2,"Season 4 is the best so far.  It is excellent.  Each season prior to this only continued to get better.  While I only gave the first season a meagre 4 stars, season 2 were both 5 stars with each season surpassing its predecessor in laughs and clever script writing.  I have found season 4 to be following the trend of surpassing yet again the excellence of the previous season, and there's no doubt season 3 was excellent as well.  This show just brightens my mood every time I watch it. There are so many good episodes here.",1411948800,,525,4.371134020618556

3322781,5,B0012EM5E2,Always love my classic TV shows better than any garbage today!  Laverne and Shirley were a great memory of my childhood.  I remember they were already on reruns when I would come home after school and watch them.  I love them even more now than I did then! :-)  I look forward to getting the rest of the series.,1404950400,,311,4.220338983050848

3322796,5,B0012EM5E2,I  think I was about eleven or twelve when the season originally ran.  Watching them again after all these years makes me feel like a kid again.  They are hilarious and have tremendous chemistry together.  They just don't make them like this any more :(,1361836800,,253,4.555555555555555
3322797,5,B0012EM5E2,"I have been collecting the seasons of Laverne and Shirley for over a year now, and each one is as hilarious as the next. I never grow tired of the slapstick mingled with the heart that the show inspires. The two girlfriends and cast members that interact with them...and sometimes STEAL the show...are a real mixture of the innocence and curiosity that WAS the late 50's and early 60's.",1343606400,,386,4.608695652173913

She's really enjoying it, keeping her portable DVD player in the kitchen so I can hear her laughing while she's watching it. Anyone who is a fan of good clean humor would like this set.",1322179200,2,290,4.290909090909091
3322810,4,B0012EM5E2,"I remember sitting through Happy Days as a kid just to see these two girls. What great chemistry the leads had. Too bad ABC moved it to Thursday nights while the show was number 1. Whose ""brilliant"" idea was that? The show went down in the ratings and never recovered...even when it was moved back to Tuesdays. This season was full of great laughs. I believe the Night School episode and the Spy in my Beer are the best. HOWEVER, the classic Laverne and Shirley episodes can only be found in Season 5! The iconic episodes are Mosejaw Express Murder Mystery ""Beware of the bald man!"", Frank and Edna's Wedding (was moved to a Baptist church where L & S sing with the African American Choir, and of course Dead Laslo's Place ""Betty please pick up your hash blacks!"" . I truly hope sales of seasons 1-4 will lead to the release of Season 5 which is the difinitive season of Laverne and Shirley just before they moved to California (another ""brilliant"" idea...what were they thinking?).",1315180800,2,982,4.5852272727272725

3322817,2,B0012EM5E2,"You have to be a fan of Shirley and Laverne to appreciate this not so funny video. Too much performing (dancing, singing, etc.) and not enough well-written humor as in the prior seasons. I actually found a few of the segments boring. Perhaps Cindy William's disputes and dissatisfaction with her acting parts affected the performance of this particular video. Would probably not be interested in purchasing any further produced seasons.",1229558400,2,436,5.242857142857143
