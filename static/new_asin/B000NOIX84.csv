2775473,5,B000NOIX84,"John Candy and Joe Flaherty of Second City TV said it very well...""it blowed up real good"". There have always been explosions in this series, but it seems that they increased exponentially by the Third Season. The first episode starts it off with an explosive expert blowing lots of stuff up.

As I took out the last disc I felt melancholy just knowing eventually I'll get to the end of the entire series. I don't want to. I am enjoying the series so much I plan to slow down my watching so I can enjoy them for a longer period of time,

Thank God for TV Land. I will be able to watch reruns once I've watched all my discs up to and including the Final Season. But for now I will savor each ""New"" episode.

The only off note is what happened to Uncle Ray?",1421366400,,755,4.157534246575342

What's really great is this is a show safe for most kids. Walker is a hero. Kids need solid heroes to show them the difference between right and wrong.",1405209600,,370,4.4411764705882355

2775528,3,B000NOIX84,"Three seasons of this police drama that ran on CBS from 1993-01, dispensing his own brand of roundhouse-kicking justice have not slowed Texas Ranger Cordell Walker (Chuck Norris). As an appreciative observer remarks at one point during season 3, ""You still have all the moves, Walker."" Whether going undercover as a cocaine dealer in Miami or ""delivering a little pain"" against white supremacists, Russian mobsters, street gangs, IRA terrorists, heroin smugglers, or vengeful ex-convicts,

Walker is ""a damn one-man army"" who ""walks the walk and talks the talk."" No one delivers Chuck-isms such as, ""The bigger they are, the harder they hit"" like Norris. Walker,

This 1994-95 Season is a bit edgier than its first 2 seasons with cruder language and more graphic action.

For instance, the episode ""The Juggernaut,"" about a wife beater terrorizing a woman's support group, is particularly rough stuff. In the explosive 3rd Season opener, ""Blown Apart,"" a Bible-quoting mad bomber unleashes a holocaust of fiery destruction that even Walker cannot defuse in time.

Among this 1994-1995 Season's most memorable episodes is ""Final Justice,"" in which Walker discovers that the man who killed his parents when he was a kid is still alive, leading to a most dangerous game in which Walker becomes the prey of this hunt-happy racist (John Vernon).

In the ""Deep Cover,"" episode, Walker partners up with a female cop(Kathy Long), who, as an actress, makes a great world champion kickboxer. ""Blackout"" opens intriguingly with an amnesiac Walker waking up in a casino office clad in a tuxedo, holding a gun and lying next to a dead body. Chuck Norris commentary would have been a real kick, but then again, he is a man of action, and this season does deliver for Walker fans.

It's also nice to see WALKER TEXAS RANGER complete, uncut, and commercial-free without all those you get on this show on TV Land, WGN, Hallmark, and USA.",1402531200,,1920,5.022012578616352

This tv show had some great morals in it and talked about a lot of the tough issues that the world is dealing with. It has the morals about right and wrong. I have seen every episode of the show and just about memorized. I recorded them on vhs tapes but have about worn them all out. That is why I have purchased all the seasons on dvd. The picture quality is a lot better than the vhs tapes which made it even more rewarding to get this series on dvd. I have a list of the episodes of this season. The episodes are:
Disc One
1.) Blown Apart

2.) Deep Cover

3.) The Guardians

4.) Collision Course

Disc Two
1.)Point After

2.) Evil In The Night

3.) Final Justice

4.) The Lynching

Disc Three
1.) Whitewater Parts 1&2

2.) The Covenant

3.)Rodeo

Disc Four
1.) Flashpoint

2.)Break In

3.)The Return Of Larue

4.) The Juggernaut

Disc Five
1.) El Coyote Part One

2.) El Coyote Part Two

3.) The Avenger

4.) Behind The Badge

Disc Six
1.) Blackout

2.) Deadline

3.) The Siege

4.) The Moscow Connection

Disc Seven
1.) Miracle At Middle Creek

2.) Hall Of Fame

This is all of the episodes that are on season three. I enjoyed them all and have no least favorites. I would highly recommend anyone watching this series and getting it on dvd. I have not regretted a minute purchasing this series on dvd. I am really happy that they finally released all of the seasons on dvd. It is a must buy for any Walker Texas Ranger fans or Chuck Norris Fans. I am also a Chuck Norris fan I also have a lot of his movies on dvd as well.

Watching it on DVD is great, because you see some scenes in the episodes that were cut out because of commercials. The quality of the DVD's are real clear and sharp. I recommend this set and all the other ones too.",1184544000,7,357,4.042253521126761

2775613,5,B000NOIX84,"To say I'm a Walker fan would be an incredible understatement.  I watched every episode when they came out, and now I am enjoying them all again on DVD.  How can anyone get enough of seeing Chuck Norris bring justice to criminals, even if only on TV.  There is such a feeling of satisfaction when you see justice served.  Speaking of which, if you've ever had a ""What Would Chuck Norris Do?"" moment, Chuck now writes weekly on the very issues affecting the day!  What a huge bonus for Chuck Norris fans.  It is obvious that a very large budget was spent on many episodes in Season 3, as the action takes Walker to many remote, hard to film locations.  Now I just have to restrain myself from watching the rest of Walker Season 3 on TV until I can watch the rest on DVD.",1180569600,14,769,4.2620689655172415
