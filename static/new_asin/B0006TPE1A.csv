2194938,5,B0006TPE1A,"Excellent Film about the ""Resurrection"" of The Prince that renunciation of material goods and an amoral society life and comfortable to recover a lost love and ruined by himself. Some people can not believe in changing life of the protagonist thinking it wouldn't happen in real life but this only ever happen when the life of someone who had done what he did REALLY try to repair the damage done. People do not believe because society teaches us to be selfish and inhumane and that to succeed you have to be dishonest, cruel, indifferent, free and irresponsible in sex and have money at the expense of others for happines. The doctrine of Christ is that which never fails and the prince ask for help REALLY in his change of life. Once again, great direction and great Rouben Mamoulian and stars Fredric March and Anna Sten play their parts as true that I was moved to tears. Beautiful and refined at the same time hard and strong film. For me, a must!.",1327190400,,953,4.578947368421052

2194940,4,B0006TPE1A,"Beautiful film made by Samuel Goldwyn, the second in his attempts to make Anna Sten into a major star.  She is breathtakingly beautiful.  Fredric March as Prince Dmitiri is perfectly paired with her to make their chemistry undeniable.

Aside from the propaganda aspects which have already been mentioned, take this film for what it is:  a tale of forbidden love exacted by professionals from an era long past.  Much Recommended.",1278979200,3,428,5.057142857142857
2194941,5,B0006TPE1A,"This remarkable film directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring the vastly underrated Anna Sten and the stellar Frederick March, is based upon Leo Tolstoy's unforgettable novel, Resurrection. The themes in this story revolve around the struggles that have plagued but ultimately elevated humanity since the beginning of time: how we may self-justify our own errors, blind spots and prejudices; the ability to self-reflect, modify our behavior, and hold ourselves accountable for our actions; to experience the transformative effects of remorse, apology and redemption; and the conditions under which we forgive. Of special note are the scenes illustrating the Russian Orthodox Easter liturgy, which are aesthetically, culturally, and spritually transporting.

2194942,1,B0006TPE1A,"This was the classic prototype of past socialist propaganda which adored Communistic Russia, was an apologist for the excesses of the communist regime, and could easily sway the idealists of that time or this time that matter. The KGB subsequently learned that a consistent subtle propaganda is more effective and believable than this movie's approach. This movie is not subtle in its message.
The story line is obscured by the obvious propaganda. The story line is unrealistic and hard to believe. The photography and editing, especially considering it was made in 1934 are excellent.",1134777600,12,585,5.23404255319149

8043117,4,B0006TPE1A,"I recently bought this movie and saw it again after many years.  Based on one of Tolstoy's great novels, ""Resurrection"", it tells the story of an aristocrat serving jury duty who realizes that the woman on trial for prostitution and murder was one of the servants in his house whom he had seduced and who was consequently thrown out.  She turned to prostitution to survive.  To pay penance he decides to follow her in her banishment in a trek to Siberia.  Tolstoy had similarly seduced a servant in like manner who was also banished.  The movie ends with hope and leaves out the perhaps most interesting pages where Tolstoy describes all the political parties that were were surfacing in the crumbling czarist regime.  Of course communism appealed as one solution; why wouldn't it?  There were also anarchists seeking a solution. Tolstoy at this point in his life, in his eighties, renounced all his most famous books like Anna Karenina and War and Peace as lacking spiritual values.  For him, great art had to have a social mission or it was worthless; he denounced opera in particular.  (Horrors!  Hadn't he hear of Verdi whose works wept for the suffering of the world and whose compassion transcended mere entertainment.)  Nevertheless. a great book with soul.  The movie is beautifully and convincingly played by the leads and the direction.  I'll be looking at it and sharing it with friends from time to time.",1453680000,2,1416,4.85

8043120,3,B0006TPE1A,"""We Live Again"" is based on Tolstoy's final novel, ""Resurrection.""  While not now considered as being on the same level as Tolstoy's ""War & Peace"" or ""Anna Karenina,"" the book actually sold better than either of those stories at the time of its release.  Tolstoy had become obsessed with  (and nearly immobilized by) thoughts of death at the time of writing Anna Karenina and the following ""Death of Ivan Illyich."" However, by the time he wrote Resurrection, he had become focused upon social reform in Russia and a very naturalized version of Christianity that did not match Russian orthodoxy (the book would in fact lead to him being kicked out of the church), topics that are dealt with in the story.

The book begins with Prince N being called for jury duty and being shocked to see the case before him involves a former peasant woman he had taken advantage of as a young woman (based upon a true story Tolstoy had learned of from his lawyer, and Tolstoy's own earlier dalliance with a peasant woman on his family's estate that had turned out badly for the woman).  To make matters worse, an obvious error by the jury (which the Russian courts will not reverse)  results in the woman being sentenced to hard labor in Siberia.  The book uses flashbacks to tell the  story of their prior relationship, and then goes on to tell the story of Prince N's efforts to help the woman, even to the point of offering to marry her.  One of the most famous passages of the book is an extended and detailed description of the horrible forced march of the prisoners to Siberia, calling to mind the disastrous marching retreat of Napoleon's ruined army depicted in War and Peace.  Like most Tolstoy stories, there is not really a happy ending to Resurrection, although it is certainly not as tragic as Anna Karenina and some of Tolstoy's other stories.

The movie follows a more chronological version of the story, beginning with the the young Prince N's relationship with the peasant woman, then a girl.  It's hard to criticize a movie that is now 80 years old and was made not long after silent movies, but even as a Tolstoy fan I found the first 30 minutes or so practically unwatchable.  It was later on that directors began using younger actors to play characters when they were young, and older actors for the characters as adults, and it really shows here as the leads in the movie seem very unrealistic in the early sections and even aware of that, as their acting at the start seems to be way over the top.

However, once the movie moves to the main event of the trial about  30 minutes in, it becomes much better from there on and the actors settle into more comfortable performances as the adult characters, especially Frederic March.  The forced march to Siberia is unfortunately given only a cursory showing and a happy ending makeover, unlike the ambiguous ending of the book, but I guess one can only expect so much from an early Hollywood treatment of a fairly involved Russian novel.

Finally, several reviewers have commented on the Communist style ""propaganda"" in the movie, but if anything, there is less of that in the movie than in the book, so I don't think that is a fair criticism of the movie.  If one ever wonders what the conditions were like in Russia shortly before the revolution, the books shows in great detail the terrible lives of the Russian peasantry at the time and the corruption of the Russian judicial system.  However, unlike the Bolsheviks, who advocated and used violence to seek their ends, Tolstoy was one of the earliest proponents of peaceful civil disobedience and reform, and his views would later influence leaders such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

So, all in all, there is a more going on in this story than might first meet the eye, even if the movie does not fully reflect it all....",1416009600,,3831,4.647407407407408

8043123,5,B0006TPE1A,"Wonderful movie with a classic morality theme of repentance set in a Russian Orthodox context. Unexpected gem of a movie. As an Eastern Orthodox Christian myself, this open display of religiosity  (prayers before icons and such) would never be tolerated in a modern movie and was pretty surprising to see.",1383782400,4,305,5.1
8043124,5,B0006TPE1A,"There is obviously socialist propaganda in this movie but one should understand the film in light of the times and story setting. Propaganda aside, this movie is wonderful. Fredric March is perfect (as usual) and Anna Sten is convincing as the beautiful, innocent farm girl. Her change from a sweet girl to bitter prostitute is excellent as is March's performance as a nave boy changed by military life. The chemistry between March and Sten is spectacular and the manner in which the seduction scene is lead up to and shot, is brilliant. When you start to feel like you are the characters in the film, you know the actors are doing their job. This is an emotional film that leads us from innocence to iniquity and then towards redemption.",1344816000,4,738,4.728682170542636
