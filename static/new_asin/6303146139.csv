7839386,5,6303146139,"This is a very difficult to find video detailing the journey of MLK from Montgomery until his death.  Be wary of ""shorter"" videos/dvd's which do not contain the complete story.",1283472000,,176,4.866666666666666
7839387,2,6303146139,"I have seen the film numerous times and wanted to order another copy for an event. The copy I received was so grainy it was hard to view. Too bad, since I was looking forward to showing it during the 45th Anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march.",1269043200,,250,4.229166666666667
7839388,5,6303146139,"You're right. The film is held by the King Family, who want very big bucks for it to be shown anywhere. The same is said for King's I Have a Dream Speech. when was the last time you saw that on television. Remember that the King family sued CBS some years ago because CBs used a portion of the speech in their cable series, ""Tjhe 20th Century with Mike Wallace."" In the end, CBS lost. When Peter Jennings produced a special about the speech in 2003, his production company paid a fortune and a half for the rights to telecast it just once...and never to sell it on home video. I understand a need to protect Dr. King's legacy, but this is pure greed, through and through. Shame on them.",1253750400,3,686,4.2846153846153845
7839389,5,6303146139,This is simply the best documentary on the life of King. Very raw and moving. The reason this documentary is not available on DVD and not being shown on TV is due to the King children. They own the rights to the film and have not release them. It is a money issue on their part.,1201132800,4,278,3.982142857142857
7839390,5,6303146139,"It's a shame that here we are in the year of 2008, and like the previous writer pointed out I can't believe that this great documentary hasn't been transfered to DVD.  I can remember that for years on Dr. King's birthday PBS would at least show the entire film of ""Montgomery to Memphis"".  And now in the age of digitalization and sattelite tv, with more than your share of high definition telecasts you can't find Dr. Martin Luther King on any Tivo search engine.  It appears now that one of the greatest orators of our time has finally been censored by the television and movie establishment.  Maybe there are those in the majority whom do not want there children to see what it was really like for African Americans in the fiftys and sixtys.  Dr. King was one of our greatest Americans who spoke so eloquently of a diverse America, that would surge ahead together, rather than separate.  It's just amazing that on his birthday, for one day, we can not at least honor him by showing his documentary.",1200873600,3,1001,4.564245810055866
7839391,5,6303146139,"It is remarkable that this film, the most notable and succinct documentary film about the civil rights struggle and the life and death of Martin Luther King has not been transferred to dvd and made available to the public again. They don't even show it anymore on PBS or any other station. They don't even show it on King's Birthday. I often wonder why.",1168819200,9,353,4.53125
