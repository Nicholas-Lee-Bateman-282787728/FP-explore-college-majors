8284904,5,B0001J2KIU,"The Edgar Bergen and Charlie Mccarthy VHS on his ventriloquism act is a delight.  It is worth having for your library and even more so if you are learning ventriloquism yourself.  There are a number of excellent sources today to teach this skill, and it is a skill, especially pronouncing the labial letters: B,F, M, P, and V.  Try making these now without moving your lips!  It's tough.  So it was with curiosity that I ordered this VHS and I am delighted to watch an expert at work.  You need not be familiar with Edgar Bergen's work, or to have watched him on television as I did to receive a treasury of 'skill-sets' of delivery, dummy movement and timing of his material to the audience.  You'll love this VHS!",1203292800,,715,4.496124031007752
