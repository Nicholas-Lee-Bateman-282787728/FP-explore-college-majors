2404912,5,B000B7MXIO,"This is a delightful, funny tv show. Too bad there were not more seasons. It is wonderful to watch a show with no cursing, sex & the usual crap that is on most tv shows today.  Beau Bridges & his father are hilarious. I love Harley Jane Kozak & their son chasing the older woman is so funny without being crude.  I think this show would have run for years but it was up against such great competition then.",1269648000,,406,4.1265822784810124
2404913,4,B000B7MXIO,"This was a favorite back when, but I never saw all the episodes before.  Now I can, and it's still as funny as it was in 1993/1994.  The disk is reasonably arranged in a set of 3, and quality is OK, except for a few hick-ups, mostly in the audio tracks.  My only peeve is that DVD makers nowadays seem to insist on adding 30 minutes of advertising material at the front of the disk that cannot be skipped over.",1188172800,2,410,4.1
2404914,3,B000B7MXIO,"This is no Bonanza!

I bought this box set of the limited adventure show, Hart of the West. It started both Beau and Lloyd Bridges.

The one joke idea of a man  buying a ranch after a mid life crisis is not fleshed out in these  fifteen episodes, The towns people seem this side of Northern Exposure and they don't work

8082880,4,B000B7MXIO,I liked this series because the stories were different. A family from Chicago buys a dilapidated (which they did know about until they got there) Dude ranch in Arizona. Different slant on the city slickers. I love Sean Murray and this was the reason I bought it!,1413072000,,262,4.595744680851064

8082882,5,B000B7MXIO,"Television programs have moved on to edgier topics these days, some of which are quite well done and worth watching, but Harts of the West exemplifies what is lacking. If you're tired of grimacing at shock-value and would rather find yourself smiling, here are 15 evenings sure to lift your spirit. Beau Bridges plays Dave Hart, who after suffering a mild heart attack decides he's had enough grimacing and wishes to lighten up by moving his reluctant family to the present day western frontier. The stories are lighthearted and simple, and the tone is laid back. It is a testimony to the strength and importance of family.

The transfer to DVD is excellent, both visually and audibly, and a steal at this price.",1403827200,,712,4.788617886178862
8082883,4,B000B7MXIO,"I bought this set because I like Sean Murray (again with the NCIS connection).
I don't remember if I actually had access to this series when it aired.

Anyway, the second episode was a delightful surprise when Mark Harmon shows up as the guest star (a red-headed rodeo clown!). So much of M.H. in his characters - and so much not!  Builds a table out of an old barn door -- scene fixing the roof reminiscent of Mexico (for NCIS fans).

Other episodes are also enjoyable (haven't finished watching all of them).
Fun to watch Lloyd and Beau Bridges together.  Dale Robertson is also great to watch.
A nice combination of serious subjects and fun.

Oh, yeah, and Sean is good!  Fun to watch him as a teen and in a character more like DiNozzio than McGee!",1388275200,,751,4.445255474452555
