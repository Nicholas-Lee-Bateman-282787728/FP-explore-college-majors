4842040,1,B005N1E8A4,I tried to play the 3D disc on PS3 connected to a Samsung 3D TV but there's simply no 3D effect. I've tried both disc 1 & 2. Is it a compatability issue?,1322956800,2,153,3.6666666666666665
4842041,5,B005N1E8A4,"AWESOME! JUST AWESOME!

Water effects at a concert??!!! How is Kylie so under appreciated in America?

GET IT ... NOW!",1322870400,,118,4.85
4842042,5,B005N1E8A4,"Finally, a Kylie disc with picture and sound to match the caliber of her shows!  This bluray is superb!  As stated in another review, much better than ""X"".  The picture is pristine and crystal clear.  The colors are rich and vibrant.  They really shows off the fantastic costumes.  The blacks are deep and inky.  The sound is big, dynamic with good bass kick and the rear channels get good use.  Everything you want from a concert on bluray. Make sure you select the option for the DTS-Master audio as it defaults to PCM Stereo.  They included a Dolby Digital track as well.  Why anyone would want to listen to a compressed version on bluray is curios.  I highly recommend this concert to everyone.  She does not dance as much as she did in her ""X"" tour but the production is top notch and the screen shots are excellent.  BUY THIS ON BLURAY!  You won't regret it.  LOVE IT!!!",1322870400,5,876,4.455696202531645
4842043,4,B005N1E8A4,"ALERT!  While this 2-disc set DOES offer Kylie's concert in Blu-Ray 3D, the discs themselves are mislabeled.  Although everything indicates that Disc 1 contains 3D playback (right down to the Blu-Ray 3D logo), it's actually Disc 2 that contains the 3D concert.  Boy, was I surprised by this mistake.

The 3D (once you get the right disc in your player) is surprisingly effective.  You wouldn't think that a concert would lend itself to 3D, but thanks to the stage design and the use of dancers, there's a nice level of depth throughout.  And (of course) Kylie herself is great.",1322524800,23,577,4.777777777777778
4842044,5,B005N1E8A4,"Having attended 3 of Kylie Minogue's tours, I had an idea of what I could expect, especially since creative partner William Baker was to produce the show: High production staging, incredible costume changes, and great live vocals. As any uber fan, I followed the tour, via Youtube, on every single one of the 77 stops.

Given her latest work, Aphrodite, I knew that there had to be some sort of element of water involved. I was in awe of the way water was incorporated into the show; there were at least 3 pools of water in which dancers and aerialists were dipped by harnesses. Water jets were applied throughout the extended stage which would be queued to shoot during choreographed numbers. Prior to the tour launch, it was announced that The Fountain People, a company known for their water shows in several Disney resorts and the Bellagio fountain shows would be working on the tour.

The Greek theme was used throughout the show in costumes, staging, and props. Although the show was slow at times, the overall feel gave every Kylie fan their money's worth.

The show itself was directed wonderfully, as aired on Sky 3D overseas and in theatres. Also, in Kylie DVD tradition, a behind-the-scenes tour documentary entitled ""Just Add Water"" will be a special features addition.

This is a brilliant show whether you like this artist or not. The use of visuals is stunning and the choreography costuming and sound are just right. This is a must see.

4842063,5,B005N1E8A4,"Les Folies is only out-shadowed by The Showgirl Tour.  It ranks as one of Kylie's best productions in my book.  The sets and the theme carry the entire show - not to mention Kylie's flawless voice.

The 3D is impeccable!

The only issue that I found was that the 3D disc was labeled as the regular Blu-Ray and the Blu-Ray was labeled as the 3D disc.",1375401600,,349,4.242424242424242

4842065,2,B005N1E8A4,"I bought the blu ray version of this tour about a month ago, and as we all know its not a cheap blu ray. When it arrived I was super excite and popped it in the blu ray player. The concert itself was amazing an the picture was perfect, but when it got to the maybe the last 5 or 6 songs it started skipping horribly. Thinking that the skipping was caused by my player I took it out and put it back in but unfoutunately it started skipping at the same spots and on the same songs. I don't know if it was just the copy I bought or if its on all blu ray copy's but I would be a little cautious when buying the blu ray copy.",1374105600,,620,3.776923076923077
4842066,5,B005N1E8A4,"WOW. That is probably the word that kept coming up constantly during the concert. It's really that good! From start to finish,  this is a masterpiece of a show that is a must watch. Prior to this concert I wasn't really into Kylie, but after watching this I  believed in her. The whole production value that went into this concert is one to be admired and appreciated. The end result is phenomenal. Definitely watch this!",1364774400,,421,4.6
4842067,3,B005N1E8A4,"Like her music was looking forward to seeing her live via BluRay. Video = 10 Audio = 10 lots of pre-recorded bits but if she was lip syncing I could not tell. Sets were incredible some with water features. Some themes were already done by Destiny's Child but who's counting. What ruined the show was the presence of male anatomy, guys touching guys, butch women, very odd costumes. Some have posted she really knows her audience well and judging from the show her target audience is gay males. Not family or straight friendly.",1362009600,4,526,4.666666666666667
4842068,5,B005N1E8A4,"I had never heard of Kylie Minogue before purchasing this combo CD/DVD.  I watched the DVD first and remained glued to my couch, mouth open, eyes like saucers, heart pounding, and breathless.  Can I say more?!  From the moment that ""Aphrodite"" (Kylie Minogue) arose onto the stage, the songs, the music, the dancing, just flowed one into another without pause, non-stop, breathtakingly.  Kylie was much to look at and follow and listen to just all by herself, but the accompanying dancers, coreography, costumes, acrobatics (at moments I did think of Cirque de Soleil, to be honest) added on just blew the lid off the pot!! Oh, just a minute...I haven't even mentioned the backdrops, the sets, the special effects, the atmosphere ultra-charged with erotica,... and the finale(s) with spurting fountains, lasers, strobes, (seen it all before? I don't think so!) I was emotionally exhausted when it was finally all over. I've watched the DVD several times and each time I go through the same beautiful punishment!  Having said all that, I don't think that those that were physically present at the concert could possibly get what I did sitting at home and letting the camerawork do it's wonders.",1351900800,2,1193,5.005050505050505

4842070,5,B005N1E8A4,"excellent show - great production.  excellent set list.  saw her show in south africa (cape town) which was the last stop on this tour and she actually sang additional (older) songs that night. fans went wild - don't think she knew that she was so popular over here in south africa - the show was excellent.
highly recommend this dvd - value for money - anytime.",1340755200,,362,4.46969696969697
4842071,5,B005N1E8A4,"I have to say, the show was amazing and I was pulled in from the beginning and became a tried and true fan.  I recommend to anyone! However, I discovered that the Blu-ray discs are labeled wrong.  If you watch the one that says it's the regular Blu-ray, the sound doesn't match her lip movement. That's because it's actually the 3D Blu-ray.  Switch 'em and it's solved.",1338595200,,369,4.477611940298507

4842074,5,B005N1E8A4,"Superb state of the art show.
once more Kylie surprised us with an incredible concert !
the songs selection were great based on her last album ""Aphrodite"" which is the same name as the show.
picture quality & sound is great.
Love it !",1330560000,,234,4.340909090909091
4842075,5,B005N1E8A4,"Being primarily a rocker and nowadays a blues enthusiast, it is hard to believe that this is my 7th title from Kylie. Yes, what a contradiction it is. Just look for all my reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. To make my explanation short, the reason is this: I only have space in my heart for ONE ""Pop Princess"". Kylie Minogue, with her beautiful smile (and everything else, from all the ""happy and loveable"" lyrics to her incredible ""sweet and hot"" personna), caught me quite easily with the ""Live In Sidney"" DVD. Since then, I ""couldn't get her out of my head"". About the DVD, the image quality (both 2D and 3D versions) is far better than the last one, in fact, it is close to perfection. Brazilian fans will be excited by some shots of our nation's flag, showed many times during the whole concert. Great collection of hits and amazing performances, not to mention the extravagant but wonderful stage. Nothing to be added concerning the 3D version, simply because I don't have this kind of equipment at home. Maybe I never will, because nothing compares to the excitement and joy you feel in a live show. Real music lovers go to concert halls and arenas, they pay tickets (in Brazil tickets are ridiculously expensive!) to see the artists they love. DVD's are a good way to relive an experience, but they can never replace them!",1327017600,,1340,4.610878661087866
4842076,5,B005N1E8A4,"Just watched this 3D concert from Kylie Minogue and words cannot describe the AWESOME and REAL experience on 3D this concert has. You can feel like you can touch her. So real visual 3D effect, the details, the sharpness and depth on the screen makes you feel like you are there by the stage watching this concert live. This concert was recorded on 3D and it definitely shows the incredible quality on 3D. I can say that after Avatar, this is the BEST 3D experience I had on a 3D TV, cause I had the same feel like ""being there"" or transported via the 3D experience. This 3D Blu Ray is a MUST HAVE to any person who likes 3D TV regardless if you are a Kylie fan or not. This concert has a lot of visual effects, great dancers, choreography and the stage is incredibly beautiful with greek columns and light effects that come out of your screen like you are there live. 10 stars to this 3D Blu Ray.

Her vocals are amazing-and she actually sings every song!! The dancers are incredible! Above all the sets are phenominal-unlike anything I have ever seen. I purchased this 3d version in hopes of owning a 3d TV sometime in the near future, so for now the 2d will have to do, however I have to tell you...I just might break down and buy the 3d TV just to see this concert in all its glory!!! That is how GREAT it is!! I am a fan of Kylie and a huge fan of her last CD Aphrodite!! I didn't know she was such a great live performer. WOW Kylie!!",1325376000,3,673,4.106060606060606
4842078,5,B005N1E8A4,"WOW!!  I witnessed first hand the power of Kylie when she toured the states in 2009 and was gobbsmacked then.  2011 saw Aprodite Live come to the USA.  You will enter to a greek themed concert, Kylie herself entering the stage standing on a golden clam shell - costumes by Dolce & Gabbana - her dancers are HOT - more muscular than other dancers.

I cannot begin to say enough about Kylie, I've been a fan since Light Years and my love has grown and grown. Like others, I have noted the discs are mislabeled, but BluRay is the best way to watch this concert.

4842081,1,B005N1E8A4,"As R.Perez 's review says, yes it is subpar to her previous concert videos.

I keep skipping tracks. The Grecian and Middle Eastern ethnic posing makes the whole going-on's half dead, lifeless, and yawnsome. Very dull. A huge disconnect with the audience and spectator.
I was expecting better going by her superb and spectacular X 2008 video, and all the youtube video's of appearances on TV shows.

I guess the plan was to reinvent and re-interpret what she did before, however it has come out the worser.

It only comes alive at 1:23 minute mark when she did the Mashup bit and then goes limp again.

Time to go watch Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, now that is timeless and has endured countless and multiple viewings.",1324166400,3,723,4.714285714285714
4842082,5,B005N1E8A4,"I saw this concert live in Fort Lauderdale and was truly blown away, it was THE BEST concert I have ever seen, thats coming from a Madonna fan. So energetic, everything live, she went on for almost 2 and a half hours (The edits make it 2 hours on the 3D disc, but nothing was missed).

Then I get the Blu Ray 3D, God I wish I could have seen it in Europe! The water effects are truly brilliant and make it a truly breathtaking concert! It's definately worth purchasing! Kylie is a performer that truly cares for her fans and you can see that in this amazing show!!",1323993600,5,564,4.174311926605505
4842083,5,B005N1E8A4,"I've seen many pop acts including Britney and Madonna. I have Kylie Minogue three times. The first being on her For You, For Me Tour and Aphrodite Live twice Stateside. I was not fortunate enough to see Les Folies (the bigger Aphrodite Live set with the huge catwalks and water show, which only toured in Europe and Asia) but this 3D experience is the closest thing I'll get to it!

As a few other reviewers mentioned, the two discs are mislabeled! The disc that does not say 3D is in fact the 3D disc. I'm not sure what went wrong there. But the concert in 3D is spectacular! ""Spectacular"" might be a under statement because I can't put into words how incredible this show is, especially in 3D. You should know that I am not a big fan of 3D things but watching this on my 3D TV and my 3D glasses makes it one hell of an experience. Kylie Minogue proves herself as an ultimate pop icon and goddess! She doesn't need the huge success in North America to prove this.
