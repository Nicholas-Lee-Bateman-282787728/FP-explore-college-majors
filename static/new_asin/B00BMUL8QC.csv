Anyone who survives also turns into A werewolf fast,and then the military gets into it and for know good reason.

5653369,4,B00BMUL8QC,"While BATTLEDOGS isn't a great film, it's one of SyFy/The Asylum's better offerings.  It has a cast of more reputable actors and the effects are better than usual.  Plotwise, it's typical government misbehavior vs. moral assignation, but I found it interesting and involving.  Dennis Haysbert from 24, THE UNIT and All State commercials is a convincingly pompous villain, nicely supported by Kate Vernon, Craig Sheffer, Ariana Richards, Wes Studi and Ernie Hudson.  I viewed BATTLEDOGS on the SyFy Channel so its upcoming DVD release may be more enjoyable to watch without commercial interruption.",1365292800,9,597,5.387096774193548

5653387,3,B00BMUL8QC,"I'm not an expert on Asylum films, but I have been watching B movies for over fifty-five years.  We all know there is a large portion of SciFi out there that we don't want to waste our time on once let alone buy.  Fortunately this B movie falls in the category of worth watching and even buying.  I am considering adding this to my SciFi library because I could see watching it a few times.  Good production values, writing, casting, acting, F/X, and music.  A virus is spread from a little girl that arrives in New York airport.  A Colonel wants it to create super soldiers even though they become large mutant bloodthirsty wolves.  A lone major and a scientist must fight even the military to keep them from stopping treatment for the virus to help the infected.  I hope this comes out in Amazon Prime Digital.

5653389,4,B00BMUL8QC,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! For a B flick it kept my attention through out the film. Not only was it funny but they were able to bust out some decent special effects. I love the Asylum Flims. They have hit or miss movies and that's fine with me. Battledogs,however, is a different concept. I mean, werewolves that are being used as weapons by the US Government!! Who would've ever thought about something like that!! Haha! This movie also has a pretty good supporting cast. Now that took me by surprise!! Anyway, it's a great junk food movie. I'm actually going to watch it again tonight. Is it worth your money?? If you're a fan of cheesy B flicks then yes, get it. You'll get a good laugh out of it at least.",1393372800,,703,4.333333333333333
5653390,5,B00BMUL8QC,"In this movie, being a werewolf is a disease that can be transmitted through a bite. The bite being the key isn't unusual for werewolf movies, except that this movie has the change happen in minutes instead of days. Werewolves can transform even if it is not the full moon. For a B-movie, this had a lot of interesting concepts, and it was interesting to see Ariana Richards (Lex from Jurassic Park) in an adult role. The copy I bought was perfectly packaged in a bubble mailer envelope, and in great condition.",1387584000,2,511,4.565217391304348

I love The Asylum and for the most part have loved the films. Of course there is the occasional one that even I can't find a silver lining in. luckily this is one of the better Asylum movies and it is a werewolf flick on top of that, who doesn't like a werewolf flick. This was a film they made with the SyFy channel like they do most of the time. It actually is a cool little flick that while not perfect is still fun.

A woman named Donna has just arrived in New York and is not feeling very well after her flight. Unfortunately for her she was bitten by a wolf elsewhere and has brought the virus back with her. She turns at starts to attack others at the airport creating pandemic of werewolf proportions. This naturally brings in the authorities who lock the infected and everyone that was there down. Major Brian Hoffman wants to find a cure for these poor people but his superiors have other things in mind.

I have to say that I was kinda surprised by how they played this out. They took this flick a little more serious than they normally do. The first half of this movie is straight up more serious than most things they have done lately while the second half turns into a more fun ride.  Shane Van Dyke [a writer on ""Chernobyl Diaries""] came up with a cool little idea here treating werewolves like a virus outbreak. Debuting Director Alexander Yellen did a good enough job here that I will be looking for more films from this person in the future.

Craig Sheffer, Dennis Haysbert, Ernie Hudson, Kate Vernon, Ariana Richards and more all do a good job here bringing the characters to life. Speaking of characters something that you normally don't get in these types of flicks is character development. I am glad to say that you get a bit of that here.

Now it is an asylum flick so it isn't perfect like the effects and such but over all I liked the look of the werewolves in this. The action is good but like any good Asylum flick things can get crazy. Still I think this is a fun flick that more people would enjoy then one would think. Give it a chance if you come across it.",1383091200,2,2101,4.3063291139240505
5653393,5,B00BMUL8QC,"This movie is awesome the design of the werewolves are fantastic and really monstrous, the plot is excellent and gives a real picture when werewolves fight each other and humans fight them and there are a lot of werewolves which makes the movie very well done!!",1379808000,,261,4.695652173913044
5653394,4,B00BMUL8QC,"The story is actually pretty good and that is might be what kept me watching.  The cgi is bad.  The blood is horrible, the weapons are a mix of really bad modified nerf guns, the american gas masks are actually russian surplus.  The main actor could try to act his way out of a bag and would die, the main actress looked like a deer in headlights the whole movie and the other main actress reminded me of Raymond Burr in Godzilla where he would show up every so often and say something important.  However, even with all those negatives I loved the movie.  I sat enthralled for the complete 90 minutes watching this thing.  It was as if the hypnotoad from Futurerama was there forcing me to watch it.  It was the most amazing trainwreck of a movie I have ever seen and would actually sit and watch it again just to see what else I could find with the movie that could make me laugh.  I will say one thing though.  I do not understand what was used at the end of the movie and that is what was disturbing to me.

All that being said, you need to watch this movie and prepare for the eventual takeover of the werewolves.  Learn from the governments mistakes and create your own bugout bag for when these creatures eventually make it to your town.  On a good note, any bullet will kill them so you won't have to melt down your grandfathers silver coins to be effective.",1378425600,,1366,4.272373540856031
5653395,1,B00BMUL8QC,Long uninteresting and not that good when it comes to special effects.  Can find better movies at the 5 dollar window at big lots,1377129600,,129,4.375
5653396,3,B00BMUL8QC,"Donna (Ariana Richards) is your average wildlife photographer who was bitten by a wolf. While at the JFK airport she finds the end stall in the ladies room unoccupied and rolls around on a spotlessly clean floor, perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of the film. Turning into a CG wolf she goes into a frenzy at the airport. The military steps in and quarantines the werewolves who return to normal.

There are two schools of thought. One group wants to find a cure, lead by Major Hoffman (Craig Sheffer) and the CDC (Kate Vernon). Then there is the idea, hmmm, maybe werewolves will be good on the battlefield. This is lead by General Monning (Dennis Haysbert) who doesn't put them in ""good hands."" This creates additional friction because simply fighting werewolves has become old hat.

I found the film a touch on the boring side. A soft 3 stars.

5653397,5,B00BMUL8QC,"All of Manhattan is quarantined when the Lupine virus spreads like wildfire, turning its' innocent civilians into violent wolves..but that's the least of its' worries as a rogue General uses the virus to create an army for other means.

I was really surprised upon watching Battledogs. To be honest, I was expecting The Asylum's usual fare(thin plot, decent CGI, fair amount of action). Yet, I was really surprised to see that Battledogs stepped up things a notch. Course, lately--I've been seeing that The Asylum have been putting alot more effort in the films they've been making for the SyFy Channel. While I don't know what's spurred them to do that, I am thankful that they're going in a more positive direction with their films. I can't wait to see their future endeavors. I've told everyone that, at some point, people are going to start looking at The Asylum as a more legitimate filmmaking company than the mockbuster maker that everyone complains that they are. If people were to look at their catalogue of films, they have a great deal of originals that are great films. Battle Dogs is a film that takes hold of its' plot and uses its' limited budget to create something original and fun for everyone to watch. I was so impressed with Battledogs that I hope The Asylum & SyFy Channel continue the story with Battledogs 2.

The only gripe that I had with Battledogs seems to be the same gripe that reviewers on the internet have been harping about...the design of the Battledogs themselves. How, you say? Well- even though the overall design of the creatures are fine for this type of film- other than different colors for the fur, they use basically the same CGI model for every one that you see on camera. I don't really mind it too much as low-budget films tend to do that.

Battledogs is one of The Asylum's upper tier of films and it shows. I highly recommend you give Battledogs a good looksee. It's a great film for lovers of the genre and then some.",1375056000,9,1967,4.646551724137931
5653398,2,B00BMUL8QC,"In this film we have a wildlife photographer bitten by a wolf in Canada, who returns to the US and turns into a rather LARGE werewolf, even when the moon isn't full, in broad daylight, at JFK.  In the ladies' room, no less.  Of course she/it rampages through the airport and either shreds or bites & infects a bunch of other people, and then suddenly NYC is under military quarantine, of sorts.  I don't know about you, but I think I've seen enough rogue miltary types that exploit (insert your crisis here) for their own evil ends, to last me a lifetime, maybe more.  And this film is packed full of grim-faced military types, bound & determined to exploit lycanthropy to create the ultimate soldiers.  Yawn.  A good guy major tries to work with the CDC to find a cure but ah, this evil general type and his evil minions aren't having any of that.  I got through an hour of this before I decided it was too cliched & stupid to finish, and I think I'll still sleep fine tonight not knowing how it ended.
