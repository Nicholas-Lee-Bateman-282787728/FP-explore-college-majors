I bought it with trepidation because of its date (1955). I adore film noir from the '40s and this date is a little late for those....however, it did contain some wonderful dark night scenes and didn't have that '50's TV-look to it that some of the pictures in the '50s began to have.
Overall, a  nice surprise!",1377129600,23,506,4.56043956043956
5538915,4,B00B04KUQE,"Well worth seeing for the legion of Ulmer admirer's. Barbara Payton is more than a curiosity. A beautiful and talented actress whose off screen life was worse than the hard and brutalized women she played on screen. Payton did make a film with James Cagney called Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye. This isn't it.

Murder Is My Beat no longer has the Cagney name attached on its Amazon page.",1359504000,20,379,4.656716417910448

I believe this was her final film before become totally unemployable due to lifestyle issues. ""Murder is My Beat"" demonstrates once again that you don't need a budget to make a watchable noir.",1489104000,,366,5.116666666666666
