7333069,5,B011ID1JLG,"Finally, SyFy got another batch of good icky bug! Lavalantula is a higher quality event than some of them. With Steve Gutenberg as the star, it was a real riot. The special effects were very well done, just cheesy enough to know they were fake but realistic enough to almost look good. The acting was very tongue in cheek, semi-serious.

The plot holes were big enough to drive a truck though, clich intended, but who cares? Its to be expected for this kind of movie.

Theres even a very pointed cameo about halfway through thats a real riot.

Of course, another volcano destroys Ellay, as if thats never happened before! Who cares? Given the budget they probably had, its best to stay close to home. Besides, its always fun to see those familiar landmarks destroyed once again. It could easily have been New Yawk.

Some of the actors looked very familiar, and I had their names just off the tip of my tongue. Ill have to look them up later on IMDB.

Lavalantua was a great escape and I had a great time in icky bug heaven. Highly recommended for b-movie fans!",1438992000,15,1060,4.5

7333073,5,B011ID1JLG,"I really enjoyed this strongly tongue-in-cheek comedy. The plot, dialog, acting, special effects, etc. are all intentionally corny and over-the-top for humor.

I enjoy serious movies, sci-fi and other, as well as anyone. But I also enjoy the occasional corny, over-the top, tongue-in-cheek humorous movie like this one. If you do too, you should enjoy Lavalantula, and probably its sequel, 2 Lava 2 Lantula, also starring Steve Guttenberg. The best such movie I have ever seen is Big Ass Spider.",1484956800,,495,5.1875

7333088,3,B011ID1JLG,"This was a fun if somewhat uneven film and an ok way to spend some time on the couch. The CGI on the spiders is actually pretty decent, but all the rest of the CGI effects were poorly realized. Fun to see Guttenberg and Winslow together again. The rest of the acting was sad, especially the the young people playing the son and his friends, although the parts as scripted were pretty bad too.",1468108800,,392,4.3108108108108105
7333089,3,B011ID1JLG,"B-movie director Mike Mendez makes his second giant spider movie after Big Ass Spider!, which for my money was a much better film.  Both are monster movie comedies that might seem very similar on the surface but the former comes by its laughs more honestly while Lavalantula seems to be aiming squarely for the Sharknado crowd with a decidedly more campy brand of humor.

Steve Guttenberg plays Colton West, a washed up 90's movie star who walks off the set of a monster bug movie only to find himself at the center of a real one when volcanic eruptions spew the gigantic, fire-breathing creatures of the title.  Colton runs around Los Angeles trying to find his son and inadvertently becomes a real action star along the way as he saves people and makes the news repeatedly for his real-life heroics.

I'm not honestly a fan of camp comedy, which I think is generally lazy, but Lavalantula did make me laugh more than a few times.  There's even occasionally a clever throwaway gag, like one that references the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Steve Guttenberg is game but a real life washed up action star like Dolph Lundgren or Bruce Willis might have been able to take the material up another notch--Guttenberg was never actually known for being an action star and is likely not the actor the screenwriters had in mind when imagining this.  The cast is peppered with other familiar faces from the 80's and 90's that you might not be able to quite place including Patrick Renna (Son in Law; The X-Files), Michael Winslow (Police Academy films) and Marion Ramsey (also Police Academy films).

I wanted to like Lavalantula a lot more than I did but it's good-natured and occasionally funny, and if you are a fan of stuff like Sharknado and Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus and other campy Sci-Fi channel films of that genre then Lavalantula should be right up your alley and is certainly one of the better-made movies of its type.  But given a choice, I would much rather watch Big Ass Spider! again because that film took itself seriously enough to generate some actual suspense and make you care about its characters.  Lavalantula, on the other hand, is all about silly laughs, so even when characters die it hardly seems to matter--you never feel like you're watching anything real or that the characters are actual human beings.  That's the reason I'm not really a fan of camp--but people who are should find much to their liking with this one.",1467936000,,2457,4.703962703962704
7333100,4,B011ID1JLG,I really think this movie was good. It certainly wasn't dumb. Just some silly humor. Better than some mainstream Hollywood movies ive seen in recent years. The story was unique as big weird monsters go. And Guttenberg to me looks good for his age. I think the only reason he ended up in B movies is bc he may have taken too much time off from acting. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was bc I was unhappy about the scene involving the kids on the run from the spiders. If you see you will understand what I mean.,1466380800,2,513,4.089108910891089

7333107,4,B011ID1JLG,"Entertaining piece of humorous 'fluff''.  Obvious low budget opened an opportunity for an 'over-the-hill' Police Academy gang to have 'one more day in the sun'.  They didn't disappoint.  And, Nia (Peeples), nice 'boob job'!  (See Blues Brothers 2000 for a 'pre-boob job' look at Ms. Peeples).  Maybe the Beverly Hills surgeon who greatly reduced Rhona Mitra's lips (See Underworld: Rise of the Lycans for another 'pre-'  comparison) used some of that material for Nia's enhancement.  And, hopefully, she was able to get a 'package deal' with the surgeon for this operation and her 'face-lift' (believe it or not, she was 52 or 53 years old when this movie was made). Also, if you ever get a chance, watch Blues Brothers 2000 - Nia has a wonderful singing voice!.  All in all, no regrets for buying this film - fun to watch!!",1459036800,2,824,4.794326241134752

7333119,5,B011ID1JLG,"If you like monster movies you'll probably like Lavalantula. It's not a big budget production but it's better than most and knows exactly what it is. It plays for laughs, special effects and plenty of interaction with the monsters - in this case, lava breathing spiders. Of course the idea is ludicrous, but that's not the point of the film. You need to accept the premise and just proceed to enjoy the ride. Where monster movies sometimes fall foul is when they take themselves too seriously, but everyone involved seems to get it. The main actors have plenty of experience and there really aren't any cringeworthy acting moments. They're actually quite likable. There's plenty of smart one-liners which are delivered pretty well. And lots of hat-tipping to other films from the past and picking these up is fun in itself. You're probably wondering what the special effects are like and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the CGI spiders - they move well and have plenty of detail. Some effects (like fire and explosions) don't fare so well but there are many films out there with worse effects than what you will find here. There's a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack which I thought was a bit restrained and even quiet in places - I was expecting a lot more from the music and rear channel effects but it mainly uses the front channels. But all up this film is great fun and one I will definitely be watching again.",1454025600,,1425,4.681274900398407

Since I first saw this movie on TV, I knew exactly what I was getting.  I bought it on purpose!  I thought Steve Guttenberg was a hoot as a desperate actor still cashing in on an old-old movie he once made (and remains the only thing he's famous for).

Of course Lavalantula is cheesy and silly, and well, yes, stupid too, I still found it highly amusing.  I love killer bug flicks, especially when they are BIG killer bugs and these particularly CGI bugs spit lava!  Thats insane and totally cool!

7333150,5,B011ID1JLG,"This is a made for TV movie done in the style of SHARKNADO. A sequel is in development. The plot is silly and not critical to the enjoyment of the feature. Giant fire breathing spiders are spewed out of a volcano and threaten LA. Colton West, a has-been actor (Steve Guttenberg type cast) tries to unite his family while the world is coming to an end. Nia Peeples plays his wife and supplies the eye candy.

What makes this film entertaining is the cast. There are at least two cast members from the POLICE ACADEMY series that are in the film with him. Michael Winslow (the sound effects  guy) is in this and hopefully will have an expanded role in the next one. Marion Ramsey, who played Hooks in the PA series is also in this film. There is a cameo by SHARKNADO guy Ian Ziering, who doesn't have time to help, he has a shark problem he must attend to. One hand Pirate Jack is played by Ralph Garman who was Captain Jack in SHARKTOPUS. There also looked like an unaccredited cameo by Samuel L. Jackson.

8724241,3,B011ID1JLG,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2015 and directed by Mike Mendez, ""Lavalantula chronicles events in Los Angeles when volcanic activity releases fire-breathing arachnids the size of people. Steve Guttenberg plays a B-movie actor who rises to the challenge of annihilating the creatures. Nia Peebles plays his wife, Noah Hunt his son and Michael Winslow his pardner. There are a lot of familiar faces.

This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek non-horror flick with great Los Angeles locations and the expected cartoony CGI, but it never becomes more than that. Peebles looks great, but the movie never really takes advantage of her presence. The Hollywood strip sequence is arguably the best part. The movie is entertaining to a point, but at the end of the day its a forgettable throwaway flick.

8724244,1,B011ID1JLG,"It's during movies such as this one that you just cannot help wondering just how desperate actors get when those roles start drying up?

Okay so maybe Steve Guttenberg's career never really set the world on fire, but he did do all those chick-flicks and Police Academy, ...yes?
Frankly I cannot imagine what depth of pecuniary desperation forced him to commit to being in this dross, but you do have to admire his ability to keep a straight face....if nothing else!
The premise here has a series of earthquakes opening huge holes under L.A. out of which crawl huge lava encrusted fire spitting spiders....I kid you not!
Guttenberg's wife played by a WAY-past-use-by-date Nia Peeples and his son played by some fence post that happened to be standing on the corner of Hollywood and Vine at the time become caught up in the situation, and Guttenberg becomes the leader of the population's fight against the steroided arachnids.
From then on it's very predictable fare, .....and almost tolerable for this mindless sort of genre until we get to Guttenberg's delivery of a motivational speech to fellow film workers before their final assault on those hotted up eight legged lava-lantulas...great name for a drag queen eh?
I defy anyone to be able to contain their absolute hysteria at this piece of overblown hype, complete with lone bugle playing sentimentally in the background!
Then the movie REALLY starts to go downhill.
The scriptwriters seem to have somehow managed to get spiders mixed up with bees or ants. Spiders do NOT have a ""queen"", but they do here and if she is killed than all the other free-roaming spiders will somehow miraculously just die?
This is achieved by throwing nitrogen cylinders with explosives attached into various lava filled holes and then detonated in sequence later to drive the queen out of a designated hole.
 Now just how the explosives and the cylinders are not almost immediately set off by the immense heat of the lava is never explained, but they remain intact to be remotely set off later, and the sequence apparently works. The Mother of All Monsters is driven above ground and then....oh well you know the drill from here on.
 Of course the extraneous characters are shown getting killed, but do wait  to see Mr. Guttenberg don some sort of Iron Man suit complete with double jet pack on his shoulders so he can fly around and deliver his nitrogen cylinder right down the spider's mouth.
Due to his inability to ""fly"" with any sort of control at all he is repeatedly smashed at a very fast speed into the sides of several concrete skyscrapers, but emerges completely unscathed...like you would!
Any way, mission accomplished, family reunited and he's a national hero, complete with the whole damned Mormon Tabernacle Choir belting out more Rah-Rah-America music in the background.
Now some of these movies can actually make it into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category, and be quite enjoyable in a campy sort of way, but this one is just SO bad it's truly terrible.
And I believe they even had the hide to make a sequel?
(This dumb idea is actually foreshadowed just before the closing credits)
