8600869,2,B00E450F7U,"I knew that the video quality might be poor from the blurb about this product on the website. However, the second episode also had an audio problem - it sounded like another, completely different program, had been recorded over the Soupy Sales episode. This detracted from enjoying the episode.",1430352000,7,294,5.020408163265306

..Soupy led the way for this type of comedy shows in the 60's...It shows how TV has progressed to this day...Anyone who likes early television will enjoy this show...MM",1424908800,,265,4.782608695652174
8600871,2,B00E450F7U,The episodes are short and it is not as funny as I remember it. But I remember looking at the show right after school back in the sixties. On episode two it appears a foreign audio track was mistakenly recorded by someone making the disk. At first I thought it was part of the story but it is clearly and editing mistake. I won't be making any future purchase of any Soupy Sales DVD's.,1386892800,9,385,4.216216216216216
8600872,2,B00E450F7U,"I loved this DVD but the second episode has a voice-over audio track of a Russian Radio station.  It drowns out the Soupy Sales Show.  I thought it was something in my sound system, but it happened on another player. I didn't ask for a refund or replacement because I loved the other 5 episodes...THE ORIGINAL Soupy.  Be prepared if you buy it.  Other than that, this is a gem!",1377648000,11,377,4.3428571428571425
