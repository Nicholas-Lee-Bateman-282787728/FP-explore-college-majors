4467604,5,B004ULEEZM,"Well cast and a very funny film, which pokes fun at the classic Dracula!  David Niven provides much levity in the role of the count.",1364601600,5,132,4.28
4467605,4,B004ULEEZM,"Great service! Silly old movie was not as funny as I remember it. The premice is good & it would be fabulous if they remade it & made it so much better, like they do these days. But it still tickles me. David Niven as Dracula! LOL!!!",1363564800,2,233,3.978723404255319
4467606,3,B004ULEEZM,"Movie was so-so. I saw the movie in the theater in Germany, 1977.  Teresa Graves looks great in this film.  Movie is kind of a spoof about Dracula's wife's blood being mixed with a black centerfold beauty contestant.  After the tranfusion, Dracula's wife awakens black (played by Teresa Graves from GET CHRISTI LOVE fame).  Typical 1970s/disco era movie, but Teresa is worth the gander.",1357689600,3,386,4.984375
4467607,3,B004ULEEZM,"I must admit I got this film chiefly for the wonderful actresses they assembled in it: Luan Peters, Linda Hayden, Veronika Carlson, Teresa Graves, and Jennie Linden.  Unfortunately you only see Linda Hayden and Teresa Graves at any length, and Ms. Graves makes the most of her part as the ""black vampire"" produced when Dracula's ailing mate gets a blood transfusion from a black woman. I don't think any other actress could have pulled this off as well, or so glamorously. David Niven is suprisingly game in the role, which just shows what a consumate actor he was. The very concept of changing Vampira into basically an African American makes one wonder what they were thinking, but it does afford a few jokes in this film which could use a lot more. This DVD-R copy (from the ""MGM Limited edition collection"" supposedly) is well done, being both widescreen and colorful, with good sound quality.  I would say it's one of the better films in a long line of unfunny vampire movie spoofs, but it's easily topped by, say, The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Love At First Bite.  For completists only, pretty much, but if you love Linda Hayden she has a great minor role here, and the party scene in the movie is worth seeing for its imaginative costumes.",1317513600,15,1249,4.69406392694064
4467608,2,B004ULEEZM,"I saw this one in the theater way back when. It's got a good cast (of British actors) but otherwise it's not so great. AIP released it in the U.S. but the print here says....""Columbia Pictures Presents..."" Go figure!",1308873600,5,216,4.564102564102564
4467659,3,B004ULEEZM,"This movie is a spoof on the vampire movies, but I'm afraid that this movie has not withstood the test of time. It should be kept in mind, though, that it came out (1974) before Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Once Bitten, and Love at First Bite, so it was a trailblazer.

Anyway, Dracula's wife, played by Niven, has been in a coma and will be revived with the right kind of rare blood. So he has been looking around for that blood. At this point, the Playboy magazine has decided to do a spread on vampires and bunnies and they go to Castle Dracula, which has become a bed and breakfast establishment (the money helps with the upkeep). While the bunnies sleep, their blood is taken and tested; one of them is the one they seek and Dracula gives his wife and transfusion. The problem is: she turns black. They decided that the way to reverse the process is to identify the girl whose blood it came from, but the bunnies have gone back to America, so Mr. & Mrs. Dracula go to New York City to track them down.",1464912000,,1003,4.278947368421052

4467662,1,B004ULEEZM,"Casting is quite solid, and for this kind of movie, they didn't seem to skimp on the budget. But the story is very weak, and you wind up just not caring how it turns out or what happens to the characters. I found this movie to be a little racist, but that is up to the individual perception - and I can't describe it without revealing too much about the plot.",1457827200,,359,4.070422535211268

comedy; he might have been good as a serious blood sucker. No comparison to Leslie Nielson's send off of ""Dracule"". Niven was a fine actor and
it was a shame he was put in this mashup.",1441065600,,325,3.9393939393939394

I seldom stop a movie once I start it - I just have to know how it ends.  With this movie, I got less than 1/3 through it and said, ""no more"".  What a dumb movie.

4467704,3,B004ULEEZM,"Yes, another Dracula movie! Nothing new here. what is new. Debonair English actor of the 50's David Niven as the count. Comedy unfolds when bringing his comatose wife back to life, she comes back as a black women due to a blood mix up. Theresa Graves as the Countess is a hoot! David Niven playing this character serious is a comedy within itself, and Theresa is charming and good to look at. This is a good movie for a couple of laughs on a rainy Saturday afternoon with nothing to do. Lite entertainment, no brain twister here.",1413244800,2,529,4.463917525773196

4467706,4,B004ULEEZM,"This movie was very contemporary considering the period it was released. The pairing of David Niven and the beautiful Teresa Graves, was inspired. The dialogue was crisply comedic and timely.",1404259200,2,191,5.4
4467707,2,B004ULEEZM,"This toothless British horror spoof was originally entitled Vampira, then re-titled Old Dracula to cash in on the then-recent success of Young Frankenstein.  Unfortunately, the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder is sorely missing here, as is the genuine affection for the genre they brought to that masterpiece.  What we're left with is a silly (and borderline offensive) plot in which Dracula's late soulmate is revived using the blood of Playboy Playmates.  Because one of them is black, it causes Drac's beloved to turn black herself.  Don't ask.  It says a lot for Niven's undying (or is that undead?) charm, and the beauty and charisma of co-star Teresa Graves, that this is at least somewhat watchable.  Lower your expectations and you may find yourself occasionally smiling at this goofy trip back to the '70s.",1398384000,3,827,5.044117647058823

8441753,4,B004ULEEZM,"Dracula is looking for the right blood to revive his wife. He finds it but the unwitting donor is black and the wife turns black. The search is on for the cure to correct the condition.

If you love the old Dracula movies from the 30's and 40's you will probably enjoy this comedy, I did. David Niven is great as a dignified non-demonic Dracula just doing what a vampire does. Beautiful Teresa Graves is pert and perfect in the role of Vampira, a 20's woman transformed into a 70's woman although I would have liked to see the transformation fleshed out a little, it was too quick and could have been played out a little. Peter Bayless was funny as Dracula's man servant. And Carol Cleveland from Monty Python has a short role in the movie.

The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is the race issue. When the film was made in the 70's we could laugh at the race issue in the film. In today's PC world we are more ""sensitive"" and some people may not see it as comic.",1484352000,,965,4.210810810810811
