208652,3,630014996X,"I have an old copy of this film on VHS but it was taped off of German TV so no subtitles and while I understood the basic story, I felt getting the DVD with subtitles was the way to go.  Generally it's a good copy of the film but it is not a restored version by any means.  I don't know whether it was a time thing or what but I did notice that some of the footage I have on the VHS copy is not on the DVD.  Specifically the scene where the Lt goes mad in the trench shouting hurrah! over and over as well as a couple of seconds here and there at the tail end or beginning of a couple of scenes.  The film is very similar to All Quiet in many respects and I like them both.  So if you've never seen this it's not a bad buy.  If you have you might be slightly disappointed with this copy but the subtitles and consequent understanding of exactly whats being said makes it worthwhile.",1331596800,10,882,3.9269662921348316
208653,4,630014996X,"If you're tired of watching ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" over and over, here's a movie that will entertain you and still be familiar. The uniforms are perfect because...they're real! The movie was filmed at a time and place where it was cheap just to use the real thing and real uniforms and equipment were in generous supply.
Don't be put off by the German dialogue. You will forget the subtitles pretty quickly and just enjoy the story.",1319068800,14,442,4.6075949367088604
208654,4,630014996X,"G. W. Pabst is one of the few cinematic geniuses... The range and diversity of his films are enormous, from studies in war to psycho-analytical case histories...

'Westfront' is a stark, impressive film, with a plot somewhat similar to Lewis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'...

The film follows the existence of four ordinary soldiers fighting on the French front during the last months of the war... Between them, they experience love, infidelity, insanity, and, ultimately, death... They are the innocent and helpless victims of a grotesque stupidity, and the poignancy of their predicament is emphasized rather than diminished by Pabst's austere approach and the film's pervading atmosphere of pessimism...

Pabst's intention is to remove all hints of glory and romance from war... Again and again certain motifs reappear in the film: the trenches, the barren stretch of land in front of the German lines, torn and removed, decorated with barbed wire, and shrouded in smoke and fog... By the process of repetition of the same scene (dialog is kept to a minimum and there is effective use of natural sounds) Pabst conveys the muddy chaos and monotony, but, above all, the isolation and deadliness... In one impressive scene the fog slowly dissolves, and in direct proportion to its rate of dissolution, hope rises of breaking out of the claustrophobic fear that the men (and now the audience) feel, until the spiritual elation caused by that prospect is shattered as we see that they are confronted by row upon row of tanks, steel monsters bearing fire and destruction...

'Westfront' is, as the French film historians, Maurice Bardche et Robert Brasillach have described it, a 'sombre and hopeless picture of war.'",1234310400,2,1730,5.145907473309609

208656,5,630014996X,"""Westfront 1918"" will immediately remind most viewers of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".  They both tell the story of the German soldier in WWI, the movies both excel in showing the destruction and futility of warfare, and they both were even released in the same year.  Everyone familiar with the films of the 1930's knows of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" yet how many are aware of ""Westfront 1918""?  I certainly wasn't yet, surprizingly, I believe that ""Westfront 1918"" is the better picture.  I don't mean to take anything away from ""AQOTWF""; it is a cinematic classic.  However, the graphics of war are far more impressive in ""Westfront"" and the impact of war on the homefront is equally superior.  There is a scene fairly early in ""Westfront"" in which soldiers are trapped in their underground dugout during a bombardment.  Their desperation as the ceiling begins to collapse above them is impressively staged.  Likewise, there is an impressive scene where the main character (Karl) goes home on leave.  There is a very poignant and instructive scene with Karl's young wife that tells of the privations and challenges of the homefront.  Her pleas at their somber parting say a lot more that the scene with the misguided college professor in ""AQOTWF"".  The camaraderie of the soldiers, their bravery in action, and the apparent pointlessness of the young men's sacrifice all create a powerful film.

If there is a fault to ""Westfront 1918"", it is the limited cast.  Rather than a cast of thousands, ""Westfront"" gives us a cast of dozens.  We're used to the massive numbers of soldiers in the WWI suicidal scenes of ""over the top"".  Rather than seeing divisions attacking, we see squads stealthily sneaking across ""No Man's Land"".  However, maybe the fault lies in me because the director Pabst did so much with so little.  ""Westfront 1918"" is far less Cecil B DeMille and far more Orson Welles.",1162944000,14,1903,4.878504672897196
208657,5,630014996X,"This classic WW1 film portrays the Germans at war from the German perspective.  It acts as an interesting counterpoint to its contemporary, All Quiet on the Western Front, which portrays the Germans from the point of view of Hollywood.
As many of the participants in the film were veterans of the real war, wearing the original uniforms and showing the original tactics, this film is fascinating from the point of view of a student of the period.
While this is a difficult title to track down, it is well worth the effort if you are interested in seeing a cinematic representation of World War 1 through the eyes of those who actually participated.",1060646400,15,648,4.734513274336283
7802961,3,630014996X,"This silent film gives a realistic portrayal of warfare in the trenches and hardship on the home front during The Great Warfrom the German perspective.

7802964,4,630014996X,"I am not going to write a full review of this film since there is adequate information about it from various sources. I did find it to be a sincere
depiction of WW1, more low key than most war films. The characters are well-defined and one gets to know them as individuals. Since it
is spoken in German (with sub-titles) it seemed more authentic than ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.  Highly recommended.
The quality of this particular DVD is quite satisfactory.",1443139200,,461,4.621951219512195
7802965,3,630014996X,"WESTFRONT 1918 is a well-crafted German antiwar film produced just two years before Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and thus is probably the last of the last antiwar movies made in that country until after WW2. In some ways it represents the essence of Weimar-era film-making, in that it is technically very advanced, very ""earthy,"" and acted at a very high level, but has a ""fractured narrative,"" following many characters, and employs very little character development. It is a bleak, bitter and brutal film whose occasional jabs of humor only serve to heighten the mood of despair, and manages to convey not only what WW1 was like for the German soldier, but also for those they left at home.

The film follows four infantrymen through a brief period during the last months of the war: Bayer the Bavarian, Karl, The Lieutenant, and The Student, all of whom serve as front-line soldiers in the trenches of the Western Front. Each man his his own particular cross to bear (the Student, for example, is desperate to sleep with this French peasant girl but the war keeps interfering), but the really important character is Karl, a tough old veteran of the trenches trying to survive long enough to get leave. Karl manages to return home and push through the bread lines full of grumbling, hungry citizenry to discover his wife in bed with someone else. After humiliating the lover at gunpoint he throws the man into the street and proceeds to cold-shoulder his wife, who begs for forgiveness and tries to explain what drove her to seek comfort in the arms of a stranger. Karl can't forgive his wife, however, and returns to the front deeply embittered, just in time to face -- with his friends -- a huge enemy attack on the trenches, complete with tanks, which threatens to overwhelm the outnumbered and exhausted German soldiers.

As you can see from this brief description of just one of the four story arcs, WESTFRONT 1918 has nothing that could properly be called a plot. It is simply ""a week in the life"" of four ordinary men trying to cope with circumstances no human being should be expected to cope with. Stuck in the trenches, constantly being shelled (in many cases by their own artillery), homesick and frightened, these soldiers express no political opinions, no understanding of the causes or motivations of the war, not even any hatred of the enemy. They are past all that. The goal is simply to cover for each other and endure -- not until the war ends (nobody talks about that, possibly because nobody believes it will ever end), but until the next opportunity comes along to experience something unwarlike -- be it a bottle, a woman or a comedy show. And yet the shadow of the war, like the shadow of death, looms over even these simple pleasures. As for the civilians, Karl's wife seems to be meant to epitomize a ""home front"" that has long ago forgotten all its slogans and passions and is waging its own battle -- against hunger (the endless bread lines), boredom and loneliness.

Technically the movie is extremely sophisticated for 1930, with remarkably smooth tracking shots and excellent sound -- an achievement, considering that this was (I believe) director G.W. Pabst's first ""talkie,"" and the writing, by Ladislaus Vajda and Peter Martin Lampel (adapted from the novel ""Four of the Infantry"" by Ernst Johannsen), is sophisticated as well, albeit in a different meaning of the word. Germans permitted more sexuality and outright swearing in their movies than Americans or British of the same era could dream of, and Pabst makes modest use of this license to heighten the atmosphere of reality. The problems I had with the film, and the reason I gave it the modest rank of three stars, were due mainly to its structure. The fractured, documentary- style of storytelling common to German cinema in the 30s makes it difficult to engage with the characters, and there were times when I felt as if Pabst were trying a bit too hard to grind the ""war is all hell"" message into the audience's brain instead of letting the horror simply speak for itself. Ultimately WESTFRONT has more of a documentary feeling than that of a feature film, and I feel as if it lessened the impact of the movie's final, pathetic scenes in a field hospital at the height of the battle.

Having said that, WESTFRONT 1918 is not an easy film to shake. It highlights the terribly impersonal way war crushes human beings -- first spiritually, then psychologically and finally physically, and perhaps ought to be ought to be mandatory viewing for those weaned on one-sided American war movies that to this very day depict ""the Krauts"" as faceless, unfeeling fodder for Brad Pitt's machine gun. Turns out they bleed, sweat, and scare just the same as us.

7802967,4,630014996X,"In this film we see four soldiers in the infantry manning the Western Front in 1918. Bayer, Karl, the Student and the Lieutenant, who is the company commander. Each one has their own experience of war due to their role in it and their nature. The subject matter of the film is like that of All Quiet on the Western Front, written by a soldier of the trenches, but instead of following a group of men from the moment they all join up together at the opening of the war to the bitter end of the fight this movie looks at a unit that is representative of Germany as a whole, fighting during the final phase of the war. It has much of the bitterness and futility of All Quiet but also seeks to portray the kameradschaft which existed among front-line soldiers. An excellent movie, although I question the accuracy of the translation of some of the subtitles. Definitely worth watching if you are interested in WWI.",1405209600,9,910,4.455089820359281

7802970,5,630014996X,"Westfront 1918 is a stunning piece of art that depicts the horrors of war including the senseless killing of people that happens in wartime. Of course, the number of people killed in World War One was greater than in practically any European war before it; for the first time mass slaughter was possible with modern inventions like airplanes, poisonous gas and tanks used to annihilate enemy forces. The film doesn't have a true plot; instead it offers a documentary-like feel to it especially because the sets, the acting and other things like the soldier's uniforms look so real. In fact--the uniforms were real--they had been salvaged from World War One and used again as costumes for the actors some of whom were soldiers in World War One! Moreover, we see the actors portraying their characters so believably as if the camera were focusing on their lives as everything and all their real life issues unfolded. Everything moves along well--indeed, I was often on the edge of my seat when watching this film! We also learn what World War One must have looked like and of course the image isn't pretty with battlefields of barbed wire, German forces shooting too short so that they accidentally bomb their front line trenches and more.

There will be comparisons and contrasts between Westfront 1918 and All's Quiet on the Western Front and for good reason--the stories and issues are somewhat similar. Both movies are especially poignant, too. All's Quiet on the Western Front has many more extras and a more elaborate plot while Westfront 1918 focuses on just a few men and the terrible war from the trenches. Moreover, Westfront 1918 shows German soldiers from a German point of view and not a Hollywood point of view. In any event, both films offer great acting and a message that war is inherently wrong and evil, something to be avoided at all costs.

In Westfront 1918, there are a few main characters worth mentioning. Karl (Gustav Diessl), a brave soldier who gets leave from the front only to discover that back at home his wife has become a prostitute, is shattered by the loss of his comrades and the infidelity of his wife. A Bavarian (Fritz Kampers) fights alongside the other soldiers and tries valiantly to kill off as many enemy soldiers as he can. A young German solider/student (Hans-Joachim Moebis) falls in love with a French girl named Yvette (Jackie Monnier) and their romance is touching; and there's a German Lieutenant (Claus Clausen) who reacts in his own way to the stress of war.

Look also for solid performances by Hanna Hoessrich as Karl's wife; Else Heller as Karl's mother and Carl Balhaus has a small cameo as a butcher.

Westfront 1918 is an excellent film for fans of the actors in it. Anyone who appreciates great film with an antiwar message would do well to add this to their collections.",1365984000,13,2830,4.804928131416838
