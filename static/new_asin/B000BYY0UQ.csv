2449412,2,B000BYY0UQ,"Mysterious Island was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Patrick Stewart and the fact that it is based on a classic by Jules Vern.
The movie brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people binding together and making their way to a South Pacific island on a balloon where they encounter a ""Jurassic Park""-like situation only instead of dinosaurs it's giant bugs.
The acting and the plot are about average, the dialogues are way below average, while the setting is not bad at all.
On the positive side:
1) The Civil War was a nice setting.
2) The South Pacific isle and its Jurassic Park feel were very interesting.
3) Tying in Captain Nemo and learning about his past in India was cool.
4) Having the pirates be sailing on an Asian ship as opposed to a European or American one was both accurate and realistic, and so was having a predominantly Asian crew.
...and that's about it.
On the negative side:
1) Weak/Unrealistic escape from the prison camp.
2) Traveling from Virginia to the South Pacific on a balloon during the US Civil War, with next to no supplies was ridiculous to say the least.
3) The woman and her daughter from Richmond had no southern accents taking away from the realism.
4) The slave had too much of an attitude for that period in history.
5) Captain Smith was way too politically correct for that period in history, or any period for that matter.
6) The most likable character is killed almost the moment he sets foot on the island.
7) The terrible special effects throughout the movie.
8) Vinnie Jones carries out a terrible performance unlike in Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo where he was great.
The film would be more suited to youngsters, as opposed to adults, who are not that difficult to please.
Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.",1151107200,6,1883,4.634730538922156
2449413,3,B000BYY0UQ,"This is a really fun movie, though a bit long.  While there are serious moments, the movie also leans heavily on satire... especially when it comes to the graphics.  Some people knock the movie for that, but I think it ads realism...  afterall this is a remake of a 50's(?) grade B scifi movie.

Good action, decent dialog... not scary at all.",1146528000,,343,4.483870967741935
2449414,4,B000BYY0UQ,"I very much enjoyed this film due primarily to the appearances of Kyle Maclachlan and Patrick Stewart. Most of the main actors were very good in this. The photography was beautiful, especially the long shots of the island, and the balloon shots at the beginning. The bugs and other CGI effects were a bit chintzy.  The DVD has a little bit more on it than was seen on Hallmark Channel. On TV it was presented as a single 3-hour event including commercials.  Without even a thorough viewing of the DVD, I was able to spot additional sequences, many of them being additional beautiful photography.  Of course, additional beginning and end credits for the 2-part miniseries lengthens it somewhat, but clearly there must be at least 20 minutes additional footage here. Plus the interviews and featurette on the set were very interesting.  While some of the pirate ship antics were predictable and not well-acted, people who enjoy this sort of thing will like this film.  I'm not crazy about the big bugs in general, so I skim through them to get onto the dialogue of the real people. Enjoy.",1142812800,26,1086,4.75531914893617
2449415,1,B000BYY0UQ,"This must have been a made-for-TV movie. I struggle to remember when I've seen anything so badly put together.

The animation is even worse than that of some movies in the 60's and 70's. The casting, acting, and directing are a complete shambles. I wish that instead of selecting one star for the rating I could have selected no star at all.

I made the mistake of thinking that because Patrick Stewart was in it playing the role of Captain Nemo, and that because the movie is 170 minutes long, that it was perhaps an artfully-produced, in-depth production of the original story. But from the way the scenes are cut apart, obviously to make room for insertion of TV commercials, this thoroughly awful treatment of Verne's classic masterpiece has ""made for TV"" all through it.

They got the whole thing with the pirate ship wrong, and butchered the plot so that you can't even recognize main points of the story.  No, the makers of this farce focus instead on the badly-acted performances of a bunch of people we've rarely, if ever, seen before, and hopefully won't see again. There wasn't even a grand finale with the volcano. The horribly animated lava just kind of slops along the landscape and intercut with that are the survivors rowing out into the open ocean. We don't even get to see the death of Nemo and destruction of the Nautilus. All in all, without doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in years. You have been warned.",1139011200,11,1434,4.633858267716535
2449416,5,B000BYY0UQ,"Firstly, it was a fun film enjoyed by all of my friends and family who saw it. I was particularly impressed with a supporting character, Pirate Capain Lee who was both very funny and meanacing at the same time. A perfect foil for the grim Vinnie Jones. In watching the credits I was shocked to discover Lee was played by author Geoffrey Giuliano! I have many of Giuliano's books and spoken word Cds and had no idea he was such an accomplished actor as well. Also swell were Jones, Stewart and Gooding. Not at all convincing was the makish, over acting, constantly mugging, Jason Durr. Lousy American accent as well! Leave it out next time Jason! Might consider sticking to your low budget British TV fare. Another bright newcomer was the suave Tom Mison. All the ladies in the film were downright bad, especially the young girl whose name escapes me and hopefully will continue to do so. Camera work great, effects so so, direction seemingly unconcerned. Still, powerful supporting actors like Mison and Giuliano went a long way in pulling this potential cluncker out of the Hallmark Channel fire! Why not buy the DVD and have a good ole family time!",1137801600,2,1150,4.698019801980198
2449417,4,B000BYY0UQ,"The original film of this Jules Verne classic featured the wondrous stop motion animation of Ray Harryhausen and the brilliant music of Bernard Hermmann.  While this made for TV miniseries doesn't match the genius of the original, it's still an entertaining, if a little overblown, adaptation.  The creatures for the most part are above average, with the exception of a few shots of the giant rat and ant.  But the others are pretty effective.  The story's pretty much the same, with some modifications of course.  Kyle MacLachlan stars as the stalwart Union captain who arranges an escape from Rebel prison via a hot air balloon.  He takes along the lovely nurse and her daughter (Gabrielle Anwar and Rosanne Calvet), his loyal slave (Omar Gooding, Cuba's son), a fellow prisoner (Jason Burr) and a confederate pirate, who meets an early doom.  This island is the home for a notorious anti-war protester, the brilliant Captain Nemo.  Nemo is played with usual flair and relish by Patrick Stewart, looking like an Indian swami in his various turbans.  Added treachery comes in Vinnie Jones, the bloodthirty pirate who wants the Isabella's gold which is hidden on the island, and protected by some very big spiders.  It's popcorn entertainment and should please fans of this type of film.",1137024000,5,1287,5.0

The effects were so so but I would expect that with a budget that was given for this movie anyways. The acting varied greatly. Patrick Stewart was probably the only recognizable actor for most people and the best one. Kyle MacLachlan was decent enough as well with Omar Gooding. The worst acting was from the pirates that played it as if it were a ""Pirates of the Caribbean meets the Goonies"" spoof. I describe it like this because the pirates in this movie tried to hard to be goofy (in my opinion) and labeled themselves too obviously as pirates such as putting skull 'n cross bones on every part of their ship.

2449477,1,B000BYY0UQ,"It's always a bad sign when a movie adaptation includes the name of the original author -- it usually means that it has nothing to do with the original story.

So I had a feeling of dark foreboding before watching ""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island,"" an alleged adaptation of Jules Verne's classic sci-fi/adventure novel. Technically it was made by the Hallmark Channel, but it's more the sort of fare that the Asylum churns out for the SyFy Chanel -- plotless and weak, horrendous special effects, and a couple of good actors clearly just there for the paycheck.

A bunch of escapees from a Confederate prison camp manage to escape in a conveniently-placed, unguarded hot-air balloon, and are quickly blown out to sea. When it crashes on a mysterious island (title check!), Captain Cyrus Smith (Kyle MacLachlan) is picked up and brought to the house of Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart with a dishtowel on his head), an eccentric steampunk genius who wants the rest of the world kept at a distance.

While looking for food and water, Cyrus' companions quickly find that the island is overrun with giant, poorly-rendered CGI animals. But Cyrus immediately distrusts Nemo because of his obvious lies and his checkered past. And at the same time, a mysterious medallion that shows the location of ""Isabella's Treasure"" on the island have attracted Captain Bob Harvey (Vinnie Jones) -- which sounds like a folk singer's name -- and his crew of cutthroats.

""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island"" could be forgiven for being a terrible adaptation of a Jules Verne novel, but it can't be forgiven for being a terrible movie. This entire trainwreck REEKS of casual ineptitude, and pretty much every part of it is embarrassingly halfhearted -- it genuinely feels like nobody cared, so they simply slapped together elements of Verne, ""Treasure Island"" and SyFy monster movies.

There isn't really a plot here -- people run around and things happen, but rarely with logical progression. Giant CGI animals (whose origins are never sufficiently explained) occasionally attack when things get too dull. The dialogue is too predictable and mediocre to even bother remembering, and there are a number of gaping plot holes that they never even try to address. It's hard to tell if laziness or lack of enthusiasm were responsible.

And the characters are as thin as paper, and can be summed up in two or three words -- Stalwart Hero, Generic Love Interest, Cowardly Confederate Soldier, Teen Girl, Faithful Manservant and so on. None of them develop beyond that, and it's a chore to even remember their names other than Nemo.

Most of the actors are either terrible or sleepwalking through their roles. Kyle McLachlan is particularly wooden, Gabrielle Anwar seems confused about where she is, and Vinnie Jones is just PAINFULLY bad, talking in a silly gravelly voice like a Monty Python parody of a pirate. Patrick Stewart is one of the few bright spots -- while he clearly doesn't care, he still gives a pretty decent depiction of Nemo. And you can spot the debut of Tom Mison (of ""Sleepy Hollow"") playing a smart, subtle young pirate who manages to make Jones look even worse, just because he's really good.

""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island"" is too inept to be cheesy fun, too dull to be so-bad-it's-good. Aside from aficionados of Stewart and Mison, it's not worth seeing for anyone.",1390348800,,3361,4.967971530249111
2449478,4,B000BYY0UQ,Interesting but strange movie. Special effects are not that great but it was interesting and Patrick Stewart is not what you expect.,1379635200,,132,5.045454545454546
2449479,2,B000BYY0UQ,"All in all, not a bad film. But to refer to it as ""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island"" is far off the mark. There is lots of Hollywood in it and very little Verne. I had hoped for something that wasn't so ridiculously fanciful as the 1961 movie of it, but this is even farther away. Nemo's crew turning into cannibals? Really! Sea monsters, plane crashes, people from the future??? If you read the book, one thing you will find so remarkable about it is that everything that happens really could happen. There is nothing very far from reality at all. That these men were able through there own ingenuity and invention to not only survive, but thrive on a remote island is what makes the story so magnificent and enduring. Jules Verne did not create such ridiculous fantasy. Let's not be convinced (via these films) that he did.",1365120000,,824,4.574324324324325
2449480,3,B000BYY0UQ,"I enjoyed this movie. A lot of people say it's bad compared to the book, but I've never read the book so I could care less about that.

It's a decent movie and something fun to watch on a relaxing Sunday afternoon. It's not something that's completely overboard with action and violence, and yet not something that I would fall asleep watching. I rented this movie from the library and I'm watching today and enjoying my Sunday just relaxing. I plan to buy this movie and possibly the book (to see how they match up) from Amazon as soon as I can afford it.

Overall, it's something different and fun to watch. It gets away from the typical Hollywood style movies you see now days. Like it or not, they are all the same. It's nice to have a movie like this once in a while.",1321747200,,772,4.280821917808219
2449481,2,B000BYY0UQ,"The best part of this movie is Captain Nemo (well portrayed by Patrick Stewart) and his cool steampunk house. Unfortunately, that's not quite enough to balance out the ridiculous scripting, the barely passable special effects, and one highly annoying Southerner. Kyle MacLachlan makes a great protagonist. He reminds me of Dale Midkiff in the Love Comes Softly series. Too bad they messed this up.",1316131200,,397,5.21875
2449482,2,B000BYY0UQ,"I don't recall Captain Nemo (as played by Patrick Stewart) being this pouty, petulant, or quite as childish.  I also don't recall his being relegated to a special guest star role.  And while I'm at it, that bandana was a bit off-putting.  Even his man servant Joseph (Roy Marsden) was more sinister.  This was more like the absentminded professor living in Jurassic Park.
Even more unsettling was the jokey approach used throughout, even while a praying mantis was biting the head off the confederate soldier.
Daffy pirates in never ending supply, an island that looked tiny from the air but boundless on the ground, humongous monsters roaming freely (and their food supply was?); this was the Classics Illustrated version of the novel (for those who don't recall or aren't of a certain era, Classics Illustrated were comic book versions of great novels published in the 40s through the early 60s.  Think of them as Cliff Notes with pictures).
I won't say this was the worst version ever made of Jules Verne's work but it certainly wasn't the greatest either.  To say a great deal of license was taken is putting it mildly (under the circumstances, maybe their license should be revoked?).  It was watchable, I'll give them that.  I don't believe, however, that should be one's goal when making entertainment.  No one involved seemed inclined to aspire to anything higher.  Hallmark aside, this looked like something the SyFy channel routinely showcases.
Not a keeper but I'm not sorry I watched it this one time.",1308268800,,1513,4.921259842519685

2449484,5,B000BYY0UQ,"This was not that bad of a movie at all.  Sure you do not see much of Captain Nemo (Played by Patrick Stewart), but the effects were great (for a television movie), and the plot was excellent.

I am not sure why so many people gave this movie bad reviews that it did not deserve.  It may not have close captioning or any bonus features but the movie itself is great, and definitely worth the low price.  Of course I have not seen that many echo Bridge produced DVDs that were not good (Unlike many of the Mill creek products.)  And to those who complain about the special effects of these type of movies, why are you complaining?  I have seen special effects shots in Buffy The Vampire Slayer that was much worser than anything that these films contain.  In the end I would take a chance on any of the films sold by echo Bridge (That is unless they raise the price to $10.00 or more.)  Sure they are cheaply made, but in the end many are actually good movies.",1295740800,,959,4.259668508287293

2449496,1,B000BYY0UQ,"There have been many very, very  bad versions of the works of Jules Verne--especially ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""--but none of them stink as badly as this piece of junk.  Yes it does have Patrick Stewart and Mr. Maclachan, but these actors cannot save this version of one of Verne's novels which has troubles of its own--how do these people know of Nemo when ""20,000 Leagues"" began after the civil war?--but is still a good, solid book.
  Here, however, the thing doesn't work at all.  By placing Nemo's appearance at the film's start gives away the plot of the whole story.  The pirates are a strange mixture of Chinese junks and pirates dressed from an earlier age--senseless--and they are the most annoying people I have ever seen.  As for the taking of the pirate ship, well, where's Errol Flynn when you need him!  In short, this film shows all the reasons why Hallmark films stink--bad plotting, so-so acting, and cheap special effects.  If anyone visits the grave of Verne, see if this one is making him turn over in the grave!

2449497,4,B000BYY0UQ,"Some viewers may get the mistaken impression that the movie just ends half way with a ""to Be Continued"" screen, and you get ripped off on the rest of the story. NOT TRUE. It was a miniseries, and it was produced in two parts. To see part two, wait for the credits to complete rolling by at the end of the movie, and part two will start.  Also, once you are watching part one, return to the menu, and you will find the link to part two. So the menu system is weird, but the film is complete.
For a television miniseries it was not too bad at all. The computer animated monsters were very impressive, and the actors were not bad, an it has Patrick Stewart.

I realize that this is a remake of the 1961 version of the story. However, I am amazed that Hallmark could ruin one of the  best adventure stories ever written.  Why feel they need to start adding enormous insects, snakes and rats? Why completely change the characters - one of the charms of the book is that the characters learn to work together and create a harmonious existence.

Things that I hated
- The computer graphics are at a high school level. One that comes to mind is of a burning ant butt... it is comically done...circa 1942
- Is not even remotely similar to the book
- Captain Nemo appears in the first 15 minutes. In the book he appears at the end showing that he is the reason for the survival of the characters.
- What is with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" appearance?
- The characters are not faithful to the book.
- There is ""treasure"" on the island
- Giant bugs and animals are everywhere.

Final Verdict -

  Unwatchable as a movie but putting ""Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island"" in the title borders on fraud. Absolutely, one of the worst renditions of a book that I have ever seen. I couldn't make it more than halfway through this so called-movie.

Filmed in Thailand, the film itself is based loosely on the novel of the same name by Jules Verne. It tells the story of escapees from a civil war camp that hijack a balloon and set sail to the skies only to have their balloon fly to a 'mysterious island' in the Pacific. There, they try to find refuge but end up facing all manner of giant animals and insects. Deep in the island lives Captain Nemo who is a recluse that is working on a bomb that could destroy an entire city. He offers aid to them all providing they help him with his cause. Sadly, they refuse and are sent out into the island. Yet, once they arrive, other dangers await them as there are pirates there in search of treasure. Nemo dislikes the pirates being there but refuses to help the escapees. In the finale, though, he ends up helping them and things work out but there is one last danger. Without giving that away, all I can say is watch this movie. For it to be what is, it is a decent movie. I liked it myself. Honestly, I watched it for Patrick Stewart's performance alone and, lol, the fact that it came in a bargain bin two-movie pack.

As pointed out, Nemo works best as a background character, but here he's front and center. He's set up nice (from a stranded on an island POV) digs. The characters seem to be just running around in the jungle, once Nemo abandons them to their fate. They encounter one cheesy special effect after another. Things are so bad that in the end, Nemo is scrambling on the deck of the Nautilus when he bumps one of the appendages on the sub, and it just topples over!

I received ""Mysterious Island"" for X-mas when I was 11, and it is one of my favorite reads after Michael Strogoff.
The Harryhausen movie was a television staple at the time, and I saw it and was disappointed at the changes.  This time, I expected the changes and was less disappointed.
Patrick Stewart, Kyle McLachlan and Gabrielle Anwar put in solid performances, as I expected.  The cast was part of the reason I bought the DVD.  The story was revised in an interesting way, with Stewart appearing almost immediately.  My major disappointments were: 1) the occasional poor integration between live shots and scenery CGI, especially in the flying scenes; and 2) the cookie-cutter pirates taken right out the Caribbean, despite the movies South Pacific location and Southeast Asian scenery.  The soundtrack is definitely a flashback to the 60's/70's B-movie tracks and it occasionally illiceted a laugh, detracting from the movie itself.
Accept the movie for what it is and enjoy, but keep in mind that it might be a little scary for the younger kids.",1205193600,,1108,4.935483870967742
2449525,3,B000BYY0UQ,"Being a fan of the 1961 version of ""Mysterious Island,"" I HAD to see this 2005 TV remake. Despite the somewhat lackluster reviews, a few things perked my interest: Patrick Stewart (aka Star Trek's Captain Picard) as Captain Nemo, Gabrielle Anwar and the long runtime of 170 minutes, just ten minutes shy of 3 hours (!). What compelled me to seek out this rendition more than anything is the simple fact that I favor stuck-on-a-deserted-island type adventures.

BASIC PLOT: A handful of people, including a nurse and her daughter, escape in a balloon from a Confederate prison in Virginia. Storm winds ludicrously take them West into the South Pacific where they land on an uncharted island. There they discover numerous huge animals and two men living as recluses, the master being the mad genius Captain Nemo, who hates war so much he's trying to invent the atomic bomb in order to stop it altogether. Add to this mix a ship of pirates seeking hidden treasure hidden somewhere on the island.

Despite the film's full title ""Jules Verne's Mysterious Island,"" the story is based on the 1961 movie rather than Verne's book. All the elements of the 1961 version are here with a few notable changes: The story is switched around so that Captain Nemo is revealed right away rather than in the final act and the castaways don't search the island and make their home in the cliff until the second half of the story. Also, there are way more gigantic creatures -- a mantis, rat, scorpion, ant, eagle, spiders, squid (or octopus), etc.

WHAT WORKS: The Thailand locations are magnificent, and far superior to the Spanish coast with fake backdrop of the '61 version; the cast is decent - characters you don't like at the beginning you'll probably start liking by the end; the score is decent, although not as good as the '61 version; the story maintains a vibe of realism despite the absurdities (for instance, it doesn't go overboard with camp like, say, ""Pirates of the Caribbean""; the CGI special effects for the various creatures are pretty good; the pirates look & act like what you'd think real pirates would act like, with a good mix of races and an accurate Eastern-styled ship (with a dubious backdoor, lol); and the second half of the story is more captivating than the first half (so if you're bored with the first half, stick around - it gets better).

During the first half you'll note a growing attraction between the castaway leader (Kyle MacLachlan) and Gabrielle Anwar's character. In the second half, this culminates in a seriously passionate kiss. This is one smoking hot kiss! It ranks with cinema's best kiss scenes, like ""Jerry McGuire"" or ""The Whole Wide World.""

After hearing the criticism leveled at the black castaway Neb (Omar Gooding), I was prepared for the worst. Upon seeing the film, however, I don't get the beef. Not one bit. Neb, as portrayed, is far from an ""1860's gansta rapper with an attitude,"" as one reviewer over-criticized. When they first land on the island he shows a bit of angst toward an unlikable character in response to the criticism, ""You're just a slave anyway."" Neb rightly responds that they're far from the Confederacy and slavery doesn't exist on deserted islands. Isn't it realistic that Neb would revel in a new-found sense of freedom now that he's far from the social constrictions of the Confederacy and America in general? Besides, his ""attitude"" is short-lived. He's actually a likable character as the rest of the film bears out. Also, even though the unlikable character is a questionable weasel throughout most of the story stick around for the last act.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Captain Nemo isn't remotely likable here - he's basically just a grumpy recluse who happens to be brilliant; there are probably TOO MANY monsters - sometimes less is more; the explanation for the numerous large creatures is lame (why didn't they just chalk it up to Nemo's experiments like the original film?); I found it hard to believe that the handful of male castaways could prevail against an entire ship of pirates during the on-board battle in the second half (but this is larger-than-life fantasy, right? And the fight is thrilling); and the CGI effects at the very end depicting lava and an erupting volcano aren't very good (although they get the job done).

One of the highlights of the original film was cutie Beth Rogan and her skimpy cavegirl outfit. Unfortunately neither female cast member in this remake dons such an outfit. I suppose it's more realistic, of course. Anyway, Danielle Calvert certainly possesses a undeniable cuteness as Helen, but Beth Rogan is all around superior.

FINAL WORD: The critics are a bit too hard on this 2005 remake. It's a respectable TV updating of the story. If you love awe-inspiring island locations, island adventure, gigantic creatures, convincing pirates, lost treasure, Captain Nemo and insightful moralizing about the evils of war, you'll want to catch this remake. The original 1961 version is a nigh-masterpiece and I admit that I can't say that about this version. It's limited by its TV budget and doesn't have the mystery build-up of the original, but it has numerous positive aspects the first one lacks, as noted above.

""Mysterious Island"" is worthwhile if you appreciate adventure/fantasy films like the original 1961 version, Sinbad, Conan, Jurassic Park and Pirates of the Caribbean (not that I'm a big fan of the latter two franchises), as long as you don't mind TV productions and the limitations thereof.

2449528,1,B000BYY0UQ,"Yessir, there is a real mystery in Jules Verne's Mysterious Island.  The mystery is why people don't read the books they ""adapt"" into films.  How very appropriate that they saw fit to put Verne's name in front of the title.  This does distinguish it from every other mysterious island.

Ostensibly this one is a remake of the Ray Harryhausen film version of 1961, although no credit is given to that film or the Columbia Pictures serial of 1951 from whence plot elements were borrowed.

Patrick Stewart portrays the grumpiest Captain Nemo ever.  Within the first half hour of this three hour opus, all the mysteries are explained.  Then the story drifts into the territory of the teleseries ""Lost.""  Having read the book, I was already lost.

It is nice that producers continue to keep the name of Jules Verne alive.  Some life in this lackluster script would have been nice.  If one is going to abandon plot ideas from the original, at least the ideas replacing them might be chosen from somewhere other than the bottom of the barrel.

A faithful rendering of the novel may be too much to ask, but if the name Hallmark is going to adorn the credits, then maybe the Hallmark tradition of the 1950's should be remembered.  Back then plays were presented in sterling silver productions.  This stainless steel one shows too much tarnish.",1181260800,6,1334,4.743478260869566
2449529,1,B000BYY0UQ,"As a kid, I was always a big fan of the Ray Harryhausen effects in movies, and ""Mysterious Island"" was my favorite.  When I saw this remake at the video store, I was really anxious to see an updated version with today's advanced special effects.

I was sorely disappointed.  Not only are the visual effects a poor effort in comparison to the 1961 version, but the modified story line is amateurishly written and the acting is as if the cast is all in on the same joke to be deliberately bad. I realized watching this that it's a made-for-TV effort, but still they don't need to make it seem so low budget.  I'm really surprised an actor like Patrick Stewart would have taken on this project after reading the script.

I'd highly recommend that you pass on this one and try the original instead.  And while you're at it, try some of Harryhausen's other films, such as ""First Men in the Moon"" (1964) and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963).",1170547200,6,935,4.502958579881657
2449530,3,B000BYY0UQ,"Escapees from a Civil War prison camp have their balloon blown to the Pacific where they find refuge on an island.  But it is a dangerous island where giant animals run free and man is on the dinner list.  But safely hidden away is a recluse and his manservant.  The recluse is Captain Nemo.  He offers aid to the refugees if they help him with his work.  Nemo is creating a bomb that can destroy an entire city.  The idea being that when men see how destructive war can be they will stop practicing war altogether because the consequences are to high.  Needles to say the refugees refuse to help and they are sent out into the dangerous jungle.

But once in the jungle there are other dangers waiting.  A legendary pirate treasure lures deadly pirates to the island.  Nemo does not like the pirates but he refuses to help though the manservant does not agree.  Finally the forces of good unite to repel the pirates and things pretty much work out.

This is not true to the book or even other film versions and many reviewers will point it out and complain that the story should be true to the original.  Of course the original was a sequel to 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and it was not true to that so even Verne is at fault.  But there are worse things wrong that not being true to the book.  The balloon is blown over 6,000 miles against the trade winds.  The characters survive with a single canteen and no food (that must have been a super-fast balloon).  Arial shots show the volcano on the back side of the island but it is usually down the beach in ground shots.  It is said the island is uncharted by any man.  I am sure Nemo knows where it is.  Plus, the pirates have no problems finding it and other survivors have brought out tales of monsters.  The end has a moment that implies the survivors will not survive past the credits 9unintentional I am sure but there just the same).  The thing in the cave has tentacles according to the shadows but turns out to be spiders later on.  Nemo gets stuck for no reason.  No mention of the seaworthiness of his vessel is ever made so one has to wonder why he doesn't just drive it away (ho obviously plans to leave and use his weapon).  There are too many monsters to be supported on the island.  Many of them pass through vegetation due to bad coordination between the sets and the CGI.

It is a fun story but it could have made more sense by just changing a few lines.  There was no need to keep brining in new monsters.  Just a couple that kept showing up would have done the same job and seemed less ridiculous.  But it is fun and full of action which is probably what was trying to be done.  If you want entertainment then this qualifies.  If you want true Jules Verne, then this does not.  Check it out.",1168905600,12,2762,4.290697674418604
2449531,4,B000BYY0UQ,"Though some reviews of this adventure miniseries have been unfavorable, the movie successfully recreates the feeling of Saturday matinee serials, as well as the Harryhausen film of 1961 which clearly inspired it. Purists seem to have been disappointed with changes from Verne's original novel, but this Hallmark production owes more to the Cy Endfield version, and in that respect, it's entertaining, colorful, delightfully improbable, and (for a TV film) sumptuous. Enough monsters, swordfights, pirates, treasure, action, scenery, and humor for five films, and the pacing is brisk. Performances manage to engage, with Patrick Stewart's Captain Nemo a standout. Set design is very elaborate, and the film has great visual beauty. Perfect for eight and ten year olds, this fanciful and endearingly childlike ""lost world"" adventure is priced right to buy, for fans.",1161648000,8,864,5.553030303030303
2449532,1,B000BYY0UQ,"Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around.

In the book, the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate home on the island.

And what about those stupid giant animals? I don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home looks like it came right from Jurassic Park.

The whole story was about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there.

On another note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy.

As one reviewer well said, it is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is nothing like the book.

Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for only $6.99?",1156377600,6,1133,4.3971291866028706
