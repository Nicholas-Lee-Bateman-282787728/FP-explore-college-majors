151124,4,0792844718,"This 1983 comedy is a real gem. No matter what the one star reviews below so ignorantly say. It's definitley one of the best jobs Michael Keaton has ever done. The movie has funny written all over it. It's too bad the people down below have no sense of humor. Keaton stars as Jack Butler, a man who is laid off from his job. As soon as he is, his wife(Teri Garr)decides to go back to work and gets a great job. Poor Jack is now home dealing with all of the normal,everyday things that you usually do. He is raising the kids, doing the dishes, laundry, making dinner. He has even started to watch soaps and hang out the neighborhood ladies. Grocery shopping is a nightmare for him. The review on this page stated that the movie is sexist. Please. People make arguments over something that's not even there. Sigh. This movie has many classic scenes as well as dialogue that you can repeat over and over. The supporting cast includes a number of familiar faces : Martin Mull, Jeffrey Tambor, and Christopher Lloyd. This is a wonderful family comedy that deserves a lot more attention than it got. Don't let the negative reviews sway you from seeing a sweet,charming comedy. Good and funny.",1015977600,25,1186,4.52093023255814
151125,5,0792844718,"After he burst off the screen in Night Shift, Michael Keaton was given his first leading role in this film.  He plays Jack Butler who designs and builds cars for a big Detroit auto maker.  Due to cutbacks, he is laid off from his job.  His wife, played by Teri Garr, has been a housewife to their three kids and hasn't worked in years.  Jack and her make a bet as to who will get a job first.  Of she does and Jack is forced to stay at home and watch the kids.  He obviously has no idea how tough the job is and the film goes through his transformation from an inept house dad to a growing into the role.  Some hilarious scenes include a trip to the supermarket gone awry, Jack's addiction to soap operas and his confrontations with his wife's smug boss played with oily charm by Martin Mull.  Teri Garr is very funny as is Ann Jillian as her best friend.  The real star is of course Mr. Keaton, who shows he cannot only be funny, but touching and caring.  a first rate performance.",979603200,22,982,4.175531914893617
151126,1,0792844718,"This movie is about a guy named Jack that loses his job at a car factory.  Jack thinks he will be able to get a job easy and he bets his wife a hundred dollars that he can get a job before her.  She ends up getting a job at an advertising place.  Which makes it so he has to stay home with the kids.  Jack has no clue about anything that he has to do like grocery shopping, taking the kids to school, and doing laundry.  Jack's wife's boss tries getting her to marry him. The movie was most likely extremely funny during the time it was made, but to watch it now it is very boring and definitely not funny.  But this is also just my opinion.  The stuff that is suppose to be funny is actually just plain stupid, like Jack cooking a cheese sandwich with a iron or having the TV repair person come see what's wrong with his TV after he kicked his foot through the screen.",978998400,6,869,4.017441860465116

it's now been reissued on blu-ray by shout factory with new 1:85:1 HD transfer
which does look amazing quality No Grain no Dirt, much better picture than the old dvd version
plus new 2.0 master stereo mix
EXTRAS for first time ever new extras for this film
a new retrospective featurette with new interviews with only few of the cast & crew from the film-goes for 35min
tragically no interviews with Michael keaton, Terri Garr or Director stan Dragoti who is age 85 now anyway
for some reason Michael and Terri must've declined to be interviewed
plus the original Trailer in new HD quality
considering the old DVD had no extras anyway, i think it's a miracle that a new featurette has been added to this new blu-ray.
so cause i take my extras seriously with old classics it's going to be a criticized rating for me,
so i give 2-3 stars for the new blu-ray, about 4 stars for the film",1505088000,,984,4.412087912087912

Producer Lauren Shuler Donner

Original Theatrical Trailer
Optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature

Some background of the film per Wikipedia:

While working at Motown Productions, story editor and struggling producer Lauren Shuler read an article in National Lampoon written by John Hughes, and decided to keep in touch with him. One day Hughes told Shuler about a disastrous experience he had looking after his two children in the absence of his wife, which Shuler found hilarious. After asking if that could make a good movie, she replied that ""it sure sounds funny to me"". Hughes wrote the film, and flew to Los Angeles to rewrite the script with Shuler. As Hughes had a TV deal with Aaron Spelling, he brought him in as an executive producer. Then the studio executives at Universal Studios were upset that Hughes was working in Chicago instead of Los Angeles, fired him and brought a group of TV writers to remake his script. Then the studio decided to turn it into a feature film instead of a television movie. Shuler, who remained as a producer, declared that while she liked the final product she thought Hughes' original script was better. While Shuler talked to her agent friend Laurie Perlman, Perlman told about ""this guy who is really funny"" who she represented, Michael Keaton. After meeting Keaton and seeing his screen debut, Night Shift (1982), Shuler decided to send the actor the script of Mr. Mom. Other actors considered for the lead role included Chevy Chase, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, and John Travolta. In turn Karen Allen, Jane Curtin, Farrah Fawcett, and Sally Field were considered for the role of Caroline before it ultimately went to Terri Garr.

It went on to receive generally positive reviews and is currently regarded by many to be one of the best films of 1983. At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the comedy has an overall rating of 85%. Despite the overall critical acclaim, there were a handful of critics who felt the film's ending was misogynistic. In recent years, with stay at home dads becoming more common, the film has come under fire for its alleged sexism.

The film opened to limited release on July 22, 1983, with $947,197, earning the number 13 spot that weekend. Upon its wide release on August 19, 1983, a month later, it opened at number 3 with $4,279,384 behind Easy Money's opening weekend and Risky Business' third. Mr. Mom ended up earning $64 million domestically. Its success led Universal to sign a three-picture deal with Hughes for $30 million(Those 3 films he would later release for the studio were Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Weird Science).",1502323200,,3180,4.9031657355679705

151171,4,0792844718,"An 80s social satire, Mr. Mom tickles the funny bone.

This comedy holds court for two big Hollywood stars of the time: Terri Garr, known for playing Inga in Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein, and Michael Keaton, who played Batman in the self-titled movie, Tim Burton's Batman. The combination of Garr and Keaton proves to be a good formula for making a snazzy, poignant, bizarre  rib-splitting comedy. As far as a movie, Mr. Mom works. Beside the acting, another reason this comedy has all of the trappings of a hit comedy, the writing. Written by John Hughes, who a couple of years after, wrote one of the most popular movies of the 80s: The Breakfast Club.

This movie well depicts the era, when women wore shoulder-pad blouses and masculine attires.

This movie begins when Jack Butler works as an engineer for an automobile corporation, but him, and his two friends, get downsized, axed from their well-paying jobs. Little money to pay the bills, Jack's wife Caroline opts to use her education and applies for a job in the advertisement field. She lands the job while Jack stays home and babysits the three kids. As it turns out, Caroline is a potent, creative, successful worker. And her husband is doing his best he can staying home with the kids.

This movie is not only funny, it also makes a social comment on women in the workforce. It shows women could succeed at work, if they leave the household, and child care tasks to the other half of the marriage. During the 80s, that was a popular social belief, and many women lelt the household to work at high profile, high status, important jobs. Women were entering the well-paying profession workforce.

This movie shows that. Yet in a funny way, there's a belly-laugh at  every corner. This movie is a sign of the time: 1980s. This movie is both funny, and profound. It really happened, women lelt the household chores. They  found those chores boring, unchallenging in the 70s, and for extra money in the household, set out to work in fields once dominated by men. Back then,  to take advantage of their education, women entered the white-collar workforce. In my neighborhood, I've seen househusbands walking the kids to bus stops. And wait there for the school buses, sometimes driven by woman bus drivers.

 Mr. Mom accurately shows that our society was changing. Women began being the breadwinner, and  sometimes, the husband, the babysitter.

Nevertheless, Mr. Mom brings the change to our culture to a funny point of view. Both Garr and Keaton elicit chuckles. They are hysterical.

In the 80s, they were different times. Those, different times, made those who adapted to the change succeed. And those who didn't, fall flat on their faces with failure: very much like Charles Darwin's theories. In Mr. Mom, Caroline and Jack adapt to the change. As a result, they strive and succeed. They survive because they adapt.",1497139200,2,2880,4.8272357723577235
151172,4,0792844718,"Impressive how much the 80's had such a deep seated and distinctive look and feel so early into the decade.  Aaron Spelling's such a master of capturing the essence of different American decades.  Look at all those references to pop culture like Rocky, Jaws, E.T. and The Young and the Restless.  Look at all the recognizable household consumer items conveniently product placed within and how many are still brand names familiar today.  Given the dozen, conservative assessment, references to extra-marital affairs plus bonus scene of male strippers in mere speedos flexing and gyrating, it's odd that this didn't get a PG-13 rating.

Good time capsule film with few to none truly cringe worthy aspects that would be better forgotten of that time period.",1497139200,4,755,5.105691056910569

Michael Keaton showcased not just his comedic skills but also the star potential and acting chops we would expect from someone who achieved such later success with Beetlejuice, Batman and Birdman.  I initially wasn't sure how he and Teri Garr would work as a believable couple, but they won me over right away. And it's still got so many memorable elements (Jaws the vacuum, the steamed grilled cheese, the Woobie), along with quotable ""water cooler"" lines:  ""You're doing it wrong,"" ""Let me tell you about flannel,"" ""May I have a moment to myself, please?""

The panning adaptations to make this film full screen when it was originally shot in Wide Screen causes motion sickness for me, so naturally I don't enjoy watching it, even though this has been a favorite of mine for years.  I am donating it to the library, as I will never watch it again.

WHY, oh WHY can't Amazon specify clearly and blatantly when one is considering a film/dvd for purchase, WHY can't they be upfront and clear if dvd/film is ""wide-screen"" or ""full-screen""?  This is a subject critical to many people, yet Amazon chooses to HIDE this important detail, resulting in a lot of disappointed purchases, and FEAR of future purchases because you have no idea what you are getting.

151399,4,0792844718,"In 1989 my wife went out to work and I stayed home with our two young children. So when we came across this movie we decided to give it a shot. After all, we had lived this story of reversed roles.

Well, not exactly. Michael Keaton's character is a successful automobile engineer who has been unceremoniously fired. Finding another job proves to be very tough. Incredibly, his wife, who loves being at home with the kids, finds a high-paying job in an advertising agency and her down-to-earth approach wins praise from the most important client.

Interestingly enough, neither the husband nor wife like their new roles. The husband bumbles along failing at the most routine household activities. The wife succeeds at work but pays too high a price at home--she misses the children and the security of her suburban enclave.

The movie is lighthearted and enjoyable . . . a relaxing way to spend an evening. We laughed and saw ourselves reflected in the various situations. But overall, this is just a routine, role reversal comedy. It is well-acted and directed. The protagonists have enough depth to make them more than just cartoon characters. And the fact that we could relate to this movie 33 years after it was made testifies to its classic status.

I recommend this as a nice way to pass the evening.",1441929600,,1306,4.765486725663717

Yes, this movie is from the 80's -- but a great movie stays great forever -- and this movie is one of them. My husband and I had this movie on VHS, years ago -- and then just recently decided to repurchase the movie on DVD. We watched the movie again (after seeing it about half a dozen times), and enjoyed it just as much as we did in 1983, when we saw the movie for the very first time. We laughed and enjoyed seeing once again, the great acting of Michael Keaton, Teri Garr, and Martin Mull. The acting and storyline is just fantastic!  If you are looking to smile and laugh, and just feel good for a couple of hours -- then I recommend buying and watching this movie! (By the way, you can never go wrong with a John Hughs movie!

151760,2,0792844718,"This is an easy and unchallenging film to watch.  Michael Keaton is made redundant from his job and becomes a stay at home father whilst his wife, played by Teri Garr, goes back to work.  Quiet predictably he realizes the stress of being a stay at home parent and there are some amusing scenes based on this.  Garr is successful in her work and works late nights and travels a lot. She is subject to the unwanted attentions of her boss which leads to a misunderstanding with Keaton.  Garr quits her job and travels home.  Keaton is being actively pursued by one of the neighborhood women and her plans are foiled when Garr returns to the family home.  Keaton and Garr realize the misunderstandings and make up.  In the meantime Keaton's old boss has been desperate for Keaton to come back to work.  Keaton decides to return to work whilst Garr gives up her job.  Overall the film is quite silly as it suggests that men and women have set roles to play in terms of careers and family, but there are some amusing moments nonetheless.",1417478400,,1031,4.5

The chemistry between Keaton and Garr is tremendous, you really feel they could be a married couple.  And the child actors playing their children, while small roles, they are very good.  Jeffrey Tambor has a small role, but he plays slimey bosses with the best of them.  Speaking of slimey bosses, Martin Mull has a supporting role as Garr's boss, and he too is terrific.

This is one of those movies that has what I like to say is the big 3; great writing, great direction and terrific on-screen chemistry with all the actors.

You need to watch the movie to get the title of this review!  Oh, and watch Mull's reaction when Keaton says this.  Like I said, terrific writing and direction!",1400198400,,870,4.484076433121019

He  a  car  plant  employee  in  Detroit  who  about  to  have  a  great  day  at  work  and  ends  up  getting  layed  off  and  come  home  late  for  dinner. During  dinner, Jack  come  up  with  up  with  this  bet  that  he  make  with  his  wife  Carol  on  who  can  get  a job  first, Carol  win  the  bet, so  Carol get  the  job  at  a  company  that  make  and  sells  tuna  and  Jack  had  to  stay  home  and  do  all  the  house  work  and  take  care  of  the  kids. This  movie  feather  a  great  cast  like  Terri Garr, Martin  Mull, Christopher  Loyde  and  Jeffery  Tambor  who  later  went  on  to  star  in  Arrested  Development. And  it  star  an  angry  washing  machine  and  an  angry  vacuum cleaner  and  a  young  and  restless  perode.. This  a  must  comedy  for  dads  of  all  type. Why  get  them  Caddy  Shack  when  you  can  get  them  this",1399161600,,1320,3.898678414096916

152072,5,0792844718,"I watched this movie with my kids back in the 90's and they still love it today.  Michael Keaton is at his comedic best, playing a stay at home dad that has to learn that working at the office was a lot easier than the day to day care of three small kids!  The supporting cast is perfect as well.",1398384000,,296,3.9166666666666665
152073,5,0792844718,"I love any movie with Michael Keaton! He has always been one of my favorite actors for years! Especially back in those days! They all made this the perfect movie, He and Teri Garr just take the cake! And Martin Mull, Loved him in my all time favorite movie, Clue and of course all of those Roseanne episodes, which is also my favorite TV Series. I remember Michael Keaton in Multiplicity. All of those different characters that he played but were all him. You really believe they are each a different person! But still him! It just goes to show how well of actor he is!! The 80's were the best time for Movie's and Music! There will never be a generation like it! So many great movie's came out of that decade and the best actor's were at there peak during that decade as well! My favorite Michael Keaton movies are The Dream Team, Beetlejuice, Gung Ho, Multiplicity, Johnny Dangerously and of course Night Shift and he was my favorite Batman ever!",1398384000,,948,4.485549132947977

152106,5,0792844718,"I know it's not high art.. But it is a well paced funny and touching movie that has distinct characters that play off each other very well. Yes it is dated but that period in time is quite enjoyable to relive (without the financial woes of the time)

Each of the actors were at the top of their game Michael Keaton shows the comedic and likable characteristics that you also saw in Multiplicity, and later his masterpiece (and Tim Burton's) Beetlejuice also made him the best Batman. Terri Garr was so great.

Martin Mull was 1983. He was really in the spotlight back then and no actor plays the smug smiler as well as he did.. Anne Jillian... Again 1983 - top of her gorgeous game. She is a favorite of mine. Just a classy lady. See her in the dream sequence...Or dancing towards the make strippers....
But that Dream Sequence makes for a great plot device that causes a neat turn in Michael's character as he suddenly gets motivated again..
Heck even the ""Gals"" are well cast and are likable actors

I love this movie not so much for the plot or the story it tells (which is amusing in and of itself) but for the fact that it takes me back to warm and loving family memories of my own.  In any case it's a fun movie that should not be taken too seriously.  It's a movie of the era and should be treated as such.,1394582400,2,387,3.63855421686747

Michael Keaton is mugging at the camera a lot, and it's annoying after a while. The 'jokes' are tired slapstick set ups that are as old as the Three Stooges and I Love Lucy, although not nearly as funny.  The kids leave no real impression.

The always great Teri Garr makes the only real sustained impression here, as the career woman struggling to keep her family together as she struggles to move up in her career and to fend off advances from her boss, the oily Martin Mull.

Add to the poor quality of the script a bunch of bad sequences with vacuums that have a mind of their own, a whole town of service techs that show up at exactly the right moment (i.e. unrealistically), and a slutty 'friend of the family' who is after the husband, and it just feels like a waste of time after 10 minutes.",1364774400,3,949,4.308988764044944

Through physical humor and an overdose of energy he's able to wring as much life as possible from several one-note scenes, but can't completely revive such a narrow concept. John Hughes gets the writing credit, but this effort is missing both the sharp wit of National Lampoon's Vacation and the warm, beating heart of his brat pack classics.

152395,4,0792844718,"This movie is just another classic that represents how wonderful movies were back in the 1980's.  A good simple family comedy without getting too tasteless with sexual innuendos and exploiting our common vices and weaknesses.  Jack's a good family man and he loves his wife, and she loves and respects him too.  Michael Keaton was great for this role because he does exhume a behavior of a loving family man who wants the best for his family.  Of course, I've always enjoyed movies with Teri Garr as either a supportive wife or a great caring mother. Teri Garr was great in ""The Black Stallion"" and in ""Oh God!"" as John Denver's wife.

It's interesting how accurate it is about how the auto industry was going through changes and that job lay-offs are eminent even back in the eighties before mass global industry started to kill off American jobs.

Anyway, as a comedy, I can relate to how difficult it is for a man to enter the commonly recognized 'woman's world' of daytime television and running a household of various chores. It is so easy for a man to take for granted of what a homemaker goes through while we men are busting our butts out in the cold working world of sales and industry.  Imagine how hard it is for a woman to take care of the house, AND have a job too.  Guys! Our wives need our help!  It's not so easy these days.

And, of course, you'll even see a little sexism in how some corporate giant can think he can persuade an attractive married woman to give up her family just for more money and status.  Martin Mull played a perfect slime ball in this film.  He thought that his high corporate status would be more influential to persuade and charm a woman than that of his own natural character.

I'd give this movie a five star rating if they ever re-release it in widescreen (not simulated widescreen by cutting off the top and bottom of the already chopped up fullscreen version like some re-releases have done).

Movies like ""Mr. Mom"" are great Saturday afternoon entertainment that you can watch with your kids.  I miss good family entertainment like this.  Another great 80's comedy that I'd like to recommend with Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously.""

And the stay at home mom is rarer & rarer.  But the jokes are still funny.  And while some have called this an insult to both sexes, it also showcases in the end that the power of love conqers all!

152418,4,0792844718,"I just saw this movie after not seeing it in many years.  Hard to believe it's been 25 years since it was released.  Times certainly have changed, but so many things have stayed the same.

Michael Keaton is Jack, a working, everyday white collar employee in Detroit working for the auto industry who finds himself out of a job.  In a somewhat odd twist of fate for the early 80s, his wife Caroline (Teri Garr) finds a job and goes to work, leaving him to care for the house and kids.  Jack is now a house husband, caring for the kids and giving into the hilarity of being a stay at home Mom.  This goes on for months on end and Jack gives into the tedium of being a stay at homer.  He gives into the endless hours of daytime television, letting the house go, letting the kids overtake him, not knowing or caring enough to learn the ropes of running a house, and having the tension mount between him and Caroline.

There are a series of screwball comedy antics between him, the kids, the household chores, and trying to keep it all under control, and the classic battle of the sexes theme is always there (a man trying to keep things under control in a woman's world).  He adopts a clique of women friends, even being chased by a shark of a divorcee, Joan.

Funny how things have changed since then.  With the poor economy and the changing gender roles in society today, it's not so uncommon to find a man staying at home with the kids.  More women are working than ever before, and more than half of the married women are the breadwinners of their families.  It might have been a little strange back then, but it's become more commonplace now.  Who knows?  Maybe someday we'll go back to these simplier times.  I see a world of slightly more courtesy in their working worlds, well behaved kids, and little to no dysfunction.",1218499200,2,1824,4.4
152419,5,0792844718,"The storyline to this 1983 comedy is quite formulaic and predictable if you've seen enough movies.  It's a role reversal comedy that has Michael Keaton playing the stay at home dad and Teri Garr playing the bread winning mom.  As perhaps unoriginal as the story may be, I challenge other viewers to find a better and more wholesome comedy that touches on the subjects of role reversal, unemployment, and child raising without crossing the zany line.  For the most part ""Mr. Mom"" is able to touch on some real critical every day issues with a winning and light touch, keeping us giggling and smiling along the way.  This isn't a comedy that has you belly laughing, it's a chuckling movie with memorable parts.

I've always felt Michael Keaton always brought a sincere character to the screen whether he played Beetlejuice, Batman, or Jack Butler.  Jack is Mr. Mom, who gets laid off work and cannot find a job before his wife does.  Teri Garr plays Carol Butler who has  instant success as a marketing assistant.  While Jack is trying to learn how to hold down a household with three kids, crazy appliances, and personal hygiene woes, Carol finds herself climbing the corporate ladder but disappearing in her role as mom on the home front.  I think the movie works because it doesn't try to introduce us to a wacky household like most other comedies try to do in order to garner some unearned laughs.  All the characters are quite believable and a lot of the events are things that every household can relate to or find humorous.

My warnings for this film is that as much as this is an easy family film, it does deal with adult issues and situations.  I always thought that Jack being shanghaied to a male strip club was in bad taste given the kind of audience it will attract; and the tempting Joan trying to seduce Jack may be inappropriate for a family audience.  There's also some mild language to watch out for.  I grew up watching Mr. Mom and I had no issues resulting from watching this movie as a kid.

The few one star reviews you will read are either incoherent or those folks confused this film with a Will Ferrell like comedy.  If you want a relaxing comedy that's good hearted and contains some funny, memorable parts then look no further.  You should enjoy this one.",1216771200,,2280,4.587654320987654

Keaton plays an out of work dad who has to take over the household duties while his wife brings home the bacon. The subplots have Keaton's wife, Teri Garr, being pursued by her boss and Keaton being pursued by a woman in the neighborhood.

The funniest part is when Keaton is dreaming his wife has caught him with another woman and has shot him. The scene plays out to the theme from The Young and the Restless as Garr's boss shows up to ask her what kind of gun she used. Garr: ""A .38, a .39, whatever it took.""

152450,4,0792844718,"Although it has still been almost 20 years since I first watched this film, it remains one of my favorite comedies.  It was perhaps the first major film of its kind in which the mom/dad and husband/wife roles were reversed.  The movie is tactful - for the most part - in dealing with the circumstances regarding these role reversals.  Though moral and marital blunders always remain close at hand, this husband/wife team remain devoted to each other, and that's a rare thing in movies today.

My personal favorite parts of the movie are the ROCKY references, espceially when Jack (Michael Keaton, the title character) gets off the beer and soaps, and starts working out, shaving, and basically redeeming himself once again - all to the tune of the upbeat ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme from ROCKY.  The very best parts of the movie - and almost everyone will agree on this - is simply watching the initial encounters and finally the rise of Jack Butler the homemaker.  These range from watching soap operas (namely THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS), adventures with the kids at the supermarket, and changing dirty diapers (after the baby finds an open can of chili!).

My complaints (and the reason for four stars instead of five) include times when the film gets a little too close to extra-marital affairs.  As I insinuated before, this does not happen, but it may still get too close for certain viewers' comfort.  Also, as one reviewer has already stated, the male stripper scene was totally out of place in a film of this kind.  (MR. MOM was released one year before the implementation of the PG-13 rating.)  And also I am very disappoined that this DVD is not available in widescreen format.  I like being able to see the whole picture.",1125360000,8,1727,4.72

152452,5,0792844718,"I think, more often than not, that I get caught up in these deeply rooted dramas that are more disturbing than entertaining.  I love films that break the mold of the modern movie and go beyond what Hollywood 2000 is currently releasing.  It seems to be the same old recycled material that has been in place for the past four years.  Maybe we are experiencing Hollywood's ""rut"", or maybe there is something more, but films today just don't seem as personal as they once were.  This is especially true in the comedies where bathroom humor comes first and plot development is somewhere in third or forth.  What ever happened to films like Mr. Mom?  Did we become too good or to technologically advanced to ever create films like this again?  If this is the case, it is very frightening to see this change in events.  Mr. Mom represents one of Hollywood's early chapters.  This was the chapter of comedy that placed genuine human settings in very humorous situations.  It was when ideas sold the film instead of sex or violence.  It was a time in Hollywood when writers were paid to use intelligence instead of just whatever the kids will laugh at.  Sadly, this chapter no longer exists, thus we are forced (willingly!) to watch films like Mr. Mom over and over again without any disappointment in our eyes.  In a way, I hope that Hollywood doesn't revert back to this style of filmmaking so that it doesn't ruin my perception of 80s comedies.

If you couldn't already tell, I really enjoyed this film.  There was just something about it that stood out for me.  I think it had something to do with the simplistic nature of this film.  There wasn't any convoluted plots, any dark sinister tumbles, any overplayed characters, or even any wildly confusing settings.  This was a very simple film and it worked at every level.  With the simplistic nature of the film, you could easily fall in love or feel a connection with Keaton's Jack.  The family, although fabricated by Hollywood, seemed like one of your own or at least one that is not too far away from your own.  There was a sense of ownership with this film that is missed in today's cinema.  The chemistry between Garr and Keaton only helped add more enjoyment to this film.  The continual ""motherly"" things that Garr did while not at home were not just funny, but somehow poignant.  It reminded me of my childhood and those days when my father had to stay at home while my mother went to work.  It was real life, or at least felt closer than what we see in the theaters today.  There were money issues, dirty homes, and small televisions ... everything the American family needs to see.

Where the real humor occurs is in the home during the day.  Keaton has the best ability to take simple chores and create disastrous, yet completely laughable, moments.  His interactions with the kids are impeccable.  You can see from the quote above the type of language he uses around one of his youngest children.  This is a scene where it is time for the kid to give up his ""security"" blanket and move forward in life.  Simply put, Keaton does fantastic as the stay at home mom.  He combines moments of Uncle Buck with the pensive nature of Steve Martin.  He is a comic, while Hollywood seems to dub him for other roles.

Perhaps that is why this film grabbed me as tight as it did.  Mr. Mom reminded me of the classic family structure and also how our world has changed so much since this film.  The ""Mr. Mom"" idea is very relevant in today's society.  Men are staying at home with the children while mothers are the sole providers.  It isn't embarrassing or uncommon to see this anymore.  Also, this was one of those films where ""nothing"" happened outside the house.  We are never taken outside the house into the real world for any extended period of time.  We never see any newspaper articles or any television news, only soap operas and radio shows.  While we can assume that there is a bad economy going on out there, we are never given a hint on how bad it is.  This again allows us to stay focused on the family.  It allows us to fall in love with them without worrying that anything bad will happen to them.  We believe, throughout this film, that they are the best representation of family possible.  They forge through any adversity and yet still come out on top.  This would be a perfect film for families to watch together that may have some struggles in their lives.  It would help them to see a family that works together for the common good.

Have I strayed off this film too much?  I don't think so.  This movie was more than just the story of a man accepting the role of the mother, but also a quick glimpse into the future.  It was an American family story that would be perfect to watch at any point in your life.  While the humor is enticing, what is most enjoyable to watch is the family and its reactions to adversity.  It fills you with hope for all of us as we enter into any unknown times in our lives.

Too philosophical?  I don't know, all I know is that I loved this film and cannot wait to watch it again.  Keaton steals the show and proves that he is more than just a regular ""Joe"" in Hollywood!

152453,4,0792844718,"I remember seeing ""Mr. Mom"" in the movie theaters twenty years ago. It was a cute, harmless comedy. Whenever I think of Michael Keaton, I think of this movie. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Butler who falls victim to layoffs at the company he works for. His wife Caroline played by Terri Garr makes a bet with him over who gets a job first. Caroline manages to get a job at an advertising agency headed by Ron Richardson (Martin Mull). The only drawback is that Caroline hasn't worked in awhile so she is like a fish out of water at the company until she comes up with a snazzy ad campaign for tuna fish. In the meantime, Jack has to take over the role of housewife and learn to clean the house, take care of the children, fix dinner, do laundry, and go grocery shopping. It takes Jack awhile to adapt to the role of Mr. Mom but he has the help of Caroline's friends. The results is hilarious especially when Jack goes to the grocery store and loses one of his children. Another favorite moments is when the women and Jack are playing poker with grocery coupons or when they end up going to a Chippendale's nightclub. ""Mr. Mom"" is good, clean fun. Nothing offensive so it is perfect for children to watch. I still enjoy watching it after all these years.",1095811200,29,1252,4.377682403433476
152454,5,0792844718,"If you don't own this movie, get it. It is a classic. The characters are believable and real and the comedy is perfectly blended between real-life/palusible situations and that intanglible movie quality that makes movies like this great. Kenny and Alex remind me...of me...when I was their age. Jack Butler, Carolyn Butler, Ron Richardson, Joan...all fantanstic characters. In my opinion, movies of the 1980's (character/plot driven movies) don't get any better than this. My one critique is that the male stripper scense seem a little out of place.

Unfortunately, the movie comedies of today are trash humor like that no talent, ""Amy Shumer"", and her ridiculous movies.  The screenwriters of today can take a lesson from those back in the early 80's and maybe someday Hollywood will produce movies like they use too.  This movie has a great cast and everyone in the family can watch it.  I really miss this time in film history.  Great to relive the moments when writing was a real art form.
