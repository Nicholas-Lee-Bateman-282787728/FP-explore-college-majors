7952132,4,B00005RDS7,Product came in good condition as described by the seller and I have actually seen this movie in the past as I thought it could have been better then (could have been much more haunting). You get what you pay for!,1388793600,,213,4.219512195121951

7952134,3,B00005RDS7,"first of the camera work was just fine!!for what they had to work with.as amatter of fact some of the camera work was awsome!!some very BAD!acting,and the storyline never quite stays in line.thats what is bad about the movie.this is whats good about the movie,the killer is spooky looking(with his silver mask)the direction & the camera work at times could be very good(like i said for what they had to work with)but most of all, and what all horror fans care about is the murder scenes. well there were some pretty cool one's in this low budget slasher flick!!!!!anyway i liked it,could have been much better and it could have been much worse,BUT DOESN'T THAT DEFINE B HORROR?!!! I THOUGHT SO!!!",1079740800,3,696,4.760330578512397
7952135,5,B00005RDS7,Frightmare (AKA Paranoid) is very good horror movie with a good plot and good acting. The camera use was not that great 2/5. But overall it was scary.,1077408000,2,150,4.392857142857143
7952136,2,B00005RDS7,"This movie caught my eye in the video store. There was just something about it. The cover looked interesting, and the story looked scary! But, when I popped in the movie I got a whole different thought, then I expected! First of all, the camera work totally [stunk]!!! The directing [stunk]!!! And the make-up for the murders looked so fake!!! The only good part of the movie was the story! Thats the only thing!! Also, the movie was annoying!! But in other words, I'd say its pretty scary.",1056844800,,490,4.579545454545454
7952137,4,B00005RDS7,"Frightmare is a great film. Well, it is great for what it is... a straight to video slasher movie. The story follows a teenage girl and her friends as they are mercilessly slaughtered by a psychopath known as the ""Concionse Killer"" who leaves some kind of twisted letter with each victim.  It overall is a great movie with actual scenes that scare you so go and rent ""Frightmare"" today!",1054080000,3,386,4.594202898550725
