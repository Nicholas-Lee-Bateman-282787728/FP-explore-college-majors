3883421,4,B002A5KY1I,"[BRAINSTORM - (1965) - Directed by William Conrad - B+W Widescreen presentation]  After watching 'My Blood Runs Cold' from the same year, also directed by William Conrad (later the star of  TV's 'Cannon'), I jumped on this film immediately, also being a fan of Anne Francis (star of 'Honey West' and numerous appearances on 'Burke's Law', 'Route 66', etc.). Though I did enjoy it for what it was, what it wasn't didn't leave me feeling similarly to 'My Blood Runs Cold', which I considered to be a better overall viewing experience (read my review). But in the William Conrad canon (no pun intended), it fares considerably better than 'Two On a Guillotine'.

Personally, I found Jeff Hunter's portrayal of the moody scientist a trite overdone; there's nothing subtle about his acting here, it borders on over-the-top once he gets romantically involved with Anne Francis' character. And the scheme he cooked up to get away with murder was rife with probable outcome nightmares from the get-go, so when things don't go as planned there's no surprise to be had, weakening the film's conclusion considerably. Forget about playing nuts, he had to have a good head start to believe this scheme was even remotely feasible. And Anne Francis suddenly disappears mid-point through the movie, returning for two minutes near the end to say what you knew she would say fifteen minutes into the proceedings. Though the film was released in 1965, it looks, feels and plays out like a film noir from the mid 50's - it has absolutely nothing to do with the 60's in any way, so it comes off somewhat dated all around. It's reminiscent of Sam Fuller's 'Shock Corridor' with a bigger budget, but not as good or as forward thinking. Again, I did enjoy it to a point, but its predictability left me flat. A 3 star flick some might consider worthy of a fourth, but never a fifth. A bit campy and certainly a guilty pleasure for me, but it should have been better, or at least had a twist somewhere to keep things interesting - it's not exactly a 'Brainstorm'.",1310688000,4,2036,4.729577464788733
3883422,5,B002A5KY1I,"Watching this stylish and nightmarish black and white movie was a great delight. I am really glad someone brings these hidden treasures to the light. The main subject of the story is the question whether the main character - a truly great performance by Jeffrey Hunter - is insane or not. The cinematography and the set design pull the viewer down into the same state of confusion as the main character. We share his insecurity as life seems to play tricks on him and everybody seems to be opposed to his view of events. Very interesting is the stark contrast between the ultra modern industrial complex in which the main character works and the Gothic interior of the residence of the owner of that corporation (small part but convincing under acting by film noir veteran Dana Andrews). Also great performance by Anne Francis as a kind of femme fatale - isn't she a vastly underrated actress who could have had a career like Ellen Burstyn? Anyway, after watching this I felt compelled to purchase the Honey West TV series in which Francis stars - another great delight in black and white.",1271116800,8,1089,4.706806282722513
3883423,5,B002A5KY1I,"This is a film noir type movie with Ann Francis the pure poison femme fatale.  Hunter is so attractive in his naivete I felt desperate to protect him from the dangerous woman.  I had seen him in other movies and as the first captain of the Enterprise, but always the nice young man....boring.  So seeing him in this movie was a total shock where I discovered what an incredible actor he is.  He first plans madness by studying everything about it.  But at some point I began to wonder if he studied too well.  His performance is so good he will keep you wondering.  All this is done with an incredible level of tension as Andrews, his boss and the lady's husband starts actually setting him up as a mad man, pulling many diabolical tricks on him.  I needn't mention the other actors......they are incidental.",1256601600,3,808,4.524137931034483

8358977,5,B002A5KY1I,"This is a fascinating film noir, full of twists and interesting characters.  Well directed by William Conrad, the actor who used to play the PI Cannon on the eponymous TV series, ""Brainstorm"" is an intriguing crime thriller about a computer wizard and the femme fatale that is his undoing.  Jeffrey Hunter and Anne Francis play the starring roles.  This is one of Hunter's best films, a film that for some reason is pretty much overlooked these days.  It's great fun to watch how it all plays out.  Jeffrey Hunter knows he shouldn't become involved with Anne Francis, but he can't help it.  He's drawn to her like a moth to a flame--and he knows what he's getting into all the while.  Still he can't stop himself.  The film doesn't have a lot of action in it.  What's enthralling is the duel between Hunter and his lover's husband, Dana Andrews, a millionaire businessman twice her age.  When Andrews learns of his wife's infidelity with Hunter, he tries to destroy Hunter's career by convincing everybody Hunter is mentally unstable.  In a neat gimmick, Hunter then uses Andrews's frame-up to get back at Andrews and get away with it.  Or does he?  Hollywood rarely makes well-plotted movies like this anymore.  More's the pity.",1465257600,2,1229,4.79047619047619
8358978,3,B002A5KY1I,"This is a good noir style movie (done in the tradition of Double Indemnity meets Kiss Me Deadly) that unfortunately came out a bit too late (like a full decade too late). If this movie had been released during the noir craze of the 1940's and 50's, it might have been a classic. Still, if you have not seen this one, do so. It's worth it.",1457827200,2,338,4.136363636363637

Jeff comes up with a plan to kill Dana in public and get away with it by pretending he's crazy. The plan is, after the murder, he'll be sent to a mental institution and after a year or so he'll act sane and they'll let him out. Then he and Anne can live happily ever after while enjoying Dana's money.",1390953600,,415,4.265822784810126
8358983,4,B002A5KY1I,"Just when Jeffrey Hunter thought he had the perfect plan, his Brainstorm quickly reverts to quicksand- this very good film show the pitfalls of using extreme measures to acquire true love- it was shot well and had some excellent characters sprinkled throughout-",1360886400,,261,5.238095238095238
8358984,5,B002A5KY1I,"Actor William Conrad directed a trilogy of films in the mid sixties which this 'BRAINSTORM' emerges as his most accomplished work.  Actor Jeffrey Hunter is involved in a nightmare when he unwittingly saves actress Anne Francis in one of her best roles from suicide. She turns out to be the wife of his employer Dana Andrews who puts a game of cat and mouse in motion utilizing Hunter's passed mental problems as the macguffin.  When Hunter and Francis become lovers, Hunter realizes he is another one of the past knights in shining armor trying to save Francis but this time Andrews pulls out all stops in a relentless deadly mind game.  Conrad directs a flawless nightmare with crisp photography by Sam Leavitt to give it a sixties film-noirish look that trancends the James Bond/Hitchcockian films around at that time.  Warner Archive releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen DVD-R transfer making it an important find in this modern day mundane film world of sequels and remakes.  The great George Dunning gives us a beautiful jazzy music score and you'll see blink or you'll miss performances by great character actors such as Michael Pate, Steve Ihnat, Strother Martin, Richard Kiel, and an important cameo by actress Viveca Linfors.  A film worthy of rediscovery, 'BRAINSTORM' is actor/director William Conrad's masterpiece and should be seen by every lover of mystery/psych puzzle films.  Jeffrey Hunter and Anne Francis alone are worth the price of the purchase. Highly recommended.",1321660800,12,1492,5.090163934426229
8358985,1,B002A5KY1I,"I can't believe anyone could enjoy this film. To refer to it as film noir is an insult to such films as ""From Out Of The Past"" and ""The Big Sleep"". Everything that happens can be seen from a long way away,and you don't want to see it when it gets here. The acting from Jeffery Hunter,sometimes an enjoyable performer,is by turns wooden,and wildly frantic. Dana Andrews mumbles his way along as the evil husband. Anne Francis as the suffering wife seems to be the only one who is even close to understanding her character,and even she seems to be looking forward to her next film. From a technical point of view the camera work is intrusive, and there is so much dialog voiced over or looped in it seems like a foreign film that is dubbed. The ending has many points that are impossible to understand,let alone believe. It seems like and ending was needed so it just ended. It does have some of the same plot elements of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"",but there are some big differences. Mainly quality and competence. A truly unenjoyable mixture of bad elements. What a mess!",1314662400,,1077,4.556701030927835
