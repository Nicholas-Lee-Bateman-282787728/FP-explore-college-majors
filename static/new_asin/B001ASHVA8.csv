3466904,5,B001ASHVA8,"This dvd is very helpful for someone that struggles with math like I do.  The guy on the video works out all the problems on a white board, step-by-step and his manner in which he explains the process of working out the math problems is very clear and basic, easy to understand.",1314921600,,278,4.346153846153846
3466905,5,B001ASHVA8,"I never thought I could understand math until I brought these DVD's. I raised my Accuplacer test from 30 to 70 with minimal effort. I recommend all of the products from Math Tutor DVD's. If you go to their website they are adding new DVD's often: HP50G calculator tutor, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering Circuits, (even Toddler Counting!) etc. They also have worksheet DVDs you can order. Can't say enough about this company. Your money will be well spent and you can always watch it again for a refresher.",1312675200,4,505,4.816091954022989
3466906,5,B001ASHVA8,"The Companion Worksheets are a must. They are the perfect companion to Jason Gibson's Algebra DVD's.  It is a great way to check your proficiency in each section of this course giving you the confidence that you own the material. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of problems spelled out for you in a step by step pattern on how to arrive to the answer, giving you yet another tool to master this subject.  Parents can easily and confidently use this to be proactive on their children's education to make sure they are progressing and mastering each section before moving on. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a real edge in understanding Algebra.",1299196800,3,662,4.798245614035087
3466907,2,B001ASHVA8,"I give it (worksheet CD) two star because of 1. if you want more exercises, this is not for you, 2. if you have high school text books, example(S) in the text book are clear enough (steps by steps) and you don't need this CD, 3. maybe, I can use it for other child when she is in 6th grade.",1294444800,2,290,3.85
3466908,5,B001ASHVA8,"I finally passed College Algebra, after running from it for years! I never took it in high school, so it was no shocker when I took the remedial classes in college & still did poorly. I saved this class for last. I invested in this dvd as well as a couple of others from Jason Gibson. I ended up taking College Algebra online & supplementing classroom time with these instructional dvds. Algebra did not come easy for me. I had to work my tail off-but Mr. Gibson's instructions really helped. He's thorough without being monotonous or boring. I highly recommend this to anyone needing clear instructions in Algebra.",1265414400,3,615,4.703703703703703
3466909,3,B001ASHVA8,"While not the most flashy of productions, this video will help kids understand math better. Lots of examples, few special FX.",1236124800,,125,5.0
3466910,4,B001ASHVA8,"The algebra and geometry DVDs have been a big help. My son attends a technical high school for carpentry, but plans to go to college as well.  He needs to keep ahead in math in order to compensate for the lost classroom time of a technical program.  This has been the perfect solution.  The worksheets were especially helpful.  If there were worksheets for geometry I would say 5 stars.

This is a straight-forward, relatively low-tech program.  There are no distractions - the units are presented in understandable chunks.  I tried 'game' type teaching tools and my son learned the game, not the math.  Math Tutor has been great.",1218412800,5,630,4.768518518518518
3466911,3,B001ASHVA8,"I purchased this Worksheet CD along with the DVD.  There are a few minor errors in the DVD which I could overlook (such as when the instructor said that 1 is a prime number.  That does not match anything else I've read on the subject of prime numbers.  Other material states that prime numbers begin at 2.)  The accompanying worksheet CD is a problem, though, because there are numerous errors and those were frustrating.  It was a helpful program overall and the price is fair but for me to recommend it, it would need to be carefully revised so that all of the mistakes within the worksheets are fully corrected.",1215907200,11,614,4.545454545454546

8279500,5,B001ASHVA8,"The worksheets were a big help in my quest to relearn Algebra.  The answers are included with explanation of each
problem.  They are in a PDF file.  There are 21 different set of worksheets.  Each set contains at least 8 pages of worksheets.  Mr. Gibson put a lot of work into these worksheets.",1420502400,,294,4.471698113207547

8279504,5,B001ASHVA8,"Math is my worst subject but with these DVD's I have been able to increase my proficiency. At times they are a little too remedial but they have helped me a great deal. Terms and procedures are explained simply and then practical demonstrations are shown. You cant go wrong here, they are well worth the expense.",1336348800,,312,4.589285714285714
