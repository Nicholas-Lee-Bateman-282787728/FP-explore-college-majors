1424725,5,B00005BJCB,"I had a chance to see this movie when I was in Australia over Christmas and would highly recommend it to anybody who likes well-crafted movies.  The Dish is fact-based account of the events surrounding Neil Armstrong's historic moonwalk from the perspective of the scientists at the Parkes Radio Telescope (used to relay  much of the first moonwalk to the rest of the Earth) and the town of Parkes itself.  While some dramatic license was taken with the truth, the movie tells a lovely story that is at once touching, funny, quirky (in a good way) and suspenseful.  Although US audiences will likely only recognize Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton, first-rate performances appear throughout the movie.  It is apparently being marketed in the US as a comedy, but I don't know if that's an accurate portrayal; the characters were kind of quirky but they also had multiple dimensions, unlike a lot of US comedies - the movie could be seen as a drama as well (the movie poster at the theater in Sydney was much more understated than the US version - I personally think that the promotion in the US doesn't do the film justice).  The soundtrack is first rate as well.  I was told by a couple of Aussies that those who like ""The Castle"" (another movie by Rob Sitch) will definitely like ""The Dish"".  In short, I paid to see the movie in a theater twice in Oz, and recommend it highly.  At any rate, I'll definitely be buying the DVD when it comes out.",988243200,35,1444,4.565891472868217
1424726,5,B00005BJCB,"This is a film that will definitely appeal to Australian tastes, the humor is very subtle so it's certainly a film that will go over the heads of most American audiences. Essentially the film traces the events of the 1969 moon landing from the point of view of the Parkes Radar dish.
It follows the experiences of the four main characters, one of which American audiences will recognise as Puddy from Sienfeld (Patrick Warburton), and the other being Sam Neill (from Jurassic Park).
Don't go into this film expecting anything as tense or exciting as Apollo 13. Essentially it's a light comedy, with most of the laughs coming from the characters experiences. If you can accept that, it's an enjoyable film. NOTE: Since I live in Australia, this film has already been released on both video and DVD (as a Region 4 release).",988156800,,821,4.748251748251748
1424746,5,B00005BJCB,This is a hidden gem of a movie. I love quirky characters and this movie was loaded with them. Extremely well acted. Oh yes and Lenka Kripac who I roasted in my review of that slasher movie she had a big part in. Her part was small here but she did a great job as Marie. Sam Neill never fails to impress with his acting ability.  This one I'll watch again and again and send a copy to my Grandson who must have watched The Martian a dozen times.,1517529600,,445,4.0

It also has a great late-60's soundtrack. If you were around for the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing, you will love this film.

1424792,5,B00005BJCB,"This lovely,sweet movie invokes the soft and sometimes faded memories of an amazing event, and offers the uplifting message of how each man can be part of a larger vision by the good works he dedicates himself to deliver.  All this  without a villain, and with some great music from the 70's.  I watch it not less than once per year, and I never fail to get a little misty-eyed when the clips of men like Walter Cronkite are shown marveling at the news of the landing.  Much nicer than the memory of Walter telling us the news of President Kennedy on November 22nd, 1963, but also the completing of a circle, the pledge of JFK to place a man on the moon, and bring him back safely.
One of the great independent movies that remind you why so many independent moves are so great!

1424798,4,B00005BJCB,"This historical fiction captures the year of Apollo in its own agreeable, whimsical way, and develops characters that are believable and easy to relate to while also being quirky and unique. The Australian setting and humor may go over some American heads, but this movie is a refreshing tale set in a historical event and is based on an actual historical place and time. While the characters and much of the town's story is fictional, the Dish itself actually existed (and still exists) and was in fact, along with the Honeysuckle Creek Station in New South Wales,  responsible for bringing the first television signals from the moon back to earth. The facts at the end are also true - the fiction is in the characters themselves, some of whom are amalgamations of several actual people. The mission and success of the Parkes Dish in adverse conditions is a matter of history - this film gives that history and warm and wonderful setting.",1477180800,3,939,4.796296296296297

1424802,4,B00005BJCB,This was a fun movie with lots of historical significance about the first moon landing. It's a bit campy but they pull it off well. Starts out a tad slow.

1424812,4,B00005BJCB,"Nice little movie about a remote Australian radio telescope station's involvement in broadcasting the first moon landing. Similar feel to ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"", with a little bit of ""October Sky"" or ""Apollo 13"" thrown in. Based on true events, it is nonetheless filled with quirky characters and the amusing culture clashes when a small town finds itself the focus of attention from Australian and American officials. Like any movie based on true events, you know what is going to happen, yet it doesn't detract from the tension of getting there when problems arise.",1467849600,,605,4.9411764705882355

1424832,4,B00005BJCB,"Having witnessed this historic event, I was amazed to learn of all the events involved getting video of the first moonwalk to us. I had always been puzzled why the first images of Neil Armstrong descending the ladder were upside-down. Could NASA have packed the camera upside-down in the ALSEP bay (where it was stored in the LM)? Actually a simpler, but surprising answer is revealed.  It's equally fascinating to find out how close we came to missing the event altogether!

What I like about this movie is that it is built around a true story;  and yes, there has been some  theatrical embellishment.  But the main facts and events are true;  the background music is truly nostalgic, and the rest is just sheer enjoyable  entertainment.

Also. Sam Neill is the only actor I recognized at the time  (I saw the American ambassador later in a different role), and all the Australian actors actually became the believable characters they  were portraying because I've never seen them before.  And that's cool.  I especially like the mayor's daughter, who reminds me of my sister back in 1969.  (Ha!)

The performances were excellent; labeled (mislabeled?) a comedy, I was delighted to find complex characters, a subtle plot, and a gripping storyline.  If you lived through the Apollo years, it'll bring back all kinds of memories and leave you with that proud glow we all used to feel when we had a successful space program.
One technical note: many reviewers (and even the movie itself) poke fun at the fact that the Parkes dish is in a remote location.  In fact, radio telescopes are purposefully placed as far from civilization as possible in order that the swarm of radio interference from cars, refrigerators, microwave ovens, garage door openers, computers, etc., etc., etc. don't interfere with the remarkably faint astronomical signals being studied.  If you're anywhere on the east coast of the U.S., go visit the radio astronomy campus at Green Bank, West Virginia, to see what I mean.

1424858,4,B00005BJCB,"I recently attended a star-gazing event/conference at one of the best dark sky locations in the Eastern half of the United States. Unfortunately, as can happen with ground-based astronomy; we had almost 100% cloud cover for the entire four-day event. On Thursday evening of the event when even the most optimistic of us had given up on doing any observing; we decided to watch this movie and what an thoroughly entertaining and moving movie it was!

For those of us old enough to remember the Apollo moon missions and most especially, the Apollo 11 mission; it was a trip down memory lane and a reminder of just how truly special and important this era was; not just for the United States but for the entire world.  Our species very first step on a world not our own. It also reminded just how many, many people were part of this event and the 10,000 things that could have gone wrong but DID go right.  I was transported back in time and once again I was a young boy who dreamed of what it would be like to be an astronaut; my face pressed up against our big color counsel TV to watch the grainy, black and white TV signal being received from the MOON as Neil Armstrong made his historic first step off the lunar lander.

For those not old enough to remember; it will help you understand and appreciate one of this countrys greatest achievements and how much the rest of the world was involved and benefited from our race to the Moon.  One dayone day soon I hope; well do it again and again and move out into our solar system and perhaps, one day, out to the stars.  Until then, this movie will perhaps give you a taste of those early days.",1429488000,,1641,4.381578947368421
1424859,5,B00005BJCB,"This is a touching true story of the people who were selected to monitor the Apollo moon landing in 1969 from a remote location in Australia. Real news clips are interspersed among the scenes in the movie, giving it a touch of realism that is poignant and exciting. The characters were well-developed and interesting, and their interaction was realistic and entertaining. There was just the right amount of humor. Having lived through the moon landing, this movie brought back many memories of that event. Although a ""small"" movie, it is one of my favorites of all time.",1428019200,,570,4.88659793814433
1424860,5,B00005BJCB,"Brilliant. A superb combination of humor and suspense. Australian films seem to have a down-to-earth, realistic feel, which increases the effect of the humor; this film is no exception. The acting is excellent. I'd recommend this to anyone who would like a break from gore, raunch, special effects and overdone attempts at humor which too often characterize contemporary Hollywood offerings.",1428019200,,391,5.533333333333333

1424862,5,B00005BJCB,"One of my favourite movies of all time. This is a true story and it is just very little known. The scenery is very correct for the period. There is plenty of humor among the very witty cast including one of my idols Sam Neil (Cliff Buckston). The story is very accurate as well. In real life I have a person connection to the Apollo 11 mission. My uncle (llyod Reeder) was the training coordinator for both Apollo 11 and 13. I know a lot about this mission. The movie highlights what could have been a history altering event. an event in which we don't have video of Armstrong and Aldrin on the surface of Luna (earth's moon) If the Parkes radio telescope didn't pull through. However, they did. This is a wonderful movie that indicates how teamwork can make history, and how great risks can have great rewards. i RECOMMEND THIS MOVE VERY HIGHLY AND WOULD GIVE IT 100 (20X OF MAXIMUM) STARS IF I COULD.",1426464000,,902,4.407185628742515
1424863,5,B00005BJCB,"I love this movie. Quirky in the very best sense of the word. A little known story at a time of a grand, worldwide story. It illustrates just how much the rest of the world was caught up in the moon landing just as much as we. With iconic music from the 60's you'll have to go a long way to find a better evening's entertainment. 5 enthusiastic stars!",1425427200,,351,4.101449275362318

1424873,5,B00005BJCB,"This is a heart-warming movie, and the events described are true.  The American scientist (from NASA) is played by the guy who now does Rules of Engagement, but he plays this one without sarcasm or cynicism.

1424885,5,B00005BJCB,"A sweet, charming, heart-warming story with roots in history. My family loves this movie, and we watch it from time to time.

The producers of this film took a potentially dull story and added real life to it. I understand that it's based in truth, which makes it even nicer to watch.

It features wonderful acting by a cast of very talented people who put humanity into a story about a radio-telescope.

Great for all ages! Delightful.",1404864000,,436,4.636363636363637
1424886,5,B00005BJCB,"This is a movie based on a true story about a famous radio antenna in Australia that was involved in communications with Apollo 11 and the first moon landing. Some liberties were taken with the facts of the actual story but not to the point of ruining it. This is a nice low-key movie about the event. There isn't a ton of action, drama or romance, but the movie makes you like the characters and want to know more about the real event. There are a few points where there is just enough drama to keep things interesting but overall, it's just a nice feel-good movie.",1403308800,,566,4.349056603773585
1424887,5,B00005BJCB,"When Australia observed in 1999 the thirtieth anniversary of its involvement in America's Apollo program ""The Dish"" was one of the occasion's off springs. The movie's approach was a creative one: take the situations the team at the Parkes radio telescope site actually faced and have them handled by a completely imaginary cast of characters. The one weak spot is that they treat it as a reminiscence piece with the site director (Sam Neill with a bad gray dye job) thinking back thirty years (Neill's hair was natural in that instance) and then returning to the then present at the movie's conclusion. Skip those parts, begin with the clip of JFK's speech before Congress that started the race to the moon and you have a great video package. The soundtrack is first rate with such Sixties standards as ""Good Morning Starshine,"" ""Get Together"" and ""Classical Gas"" providing a good backdrop. I much prefer Patrick Warburton playing NASA point man Al Burnett than as the clueless boyfriend David Puddy on ""Seinfeld."" The ""hayride"" Neill and Warburton take is by far the best scene in ""The Dish."" Also outstanding is little Carl Snell playing Billy, the mayor's son and dad's chief scientific advisor on Apollo 11. He is a nice contrast to Broadway star John McMartin playing American ambassador Howard Huddfield, also a space enthusiast. Hey, any good enthusiasm is welcome in Parkes, Australia!",1400716800,2,1393,5.008620689655173
1424888,5,B00005BJCB,"This movie was under my radar until someone recommended it to me and I'm so glad he did.  It is funny, charming and well acted.  It also gives you the opportunity to learn something you never knew before about the moon landing in 1969.",1399593600,,235,4.318181818181818
1424889,5,B00005BJCB,"This is a lovely film focusing on a seminal event for the world: the 1969 moon landing.

1424891,5,B00005BJCB,"I found this reminiscent story of one satellite station in Australia during NASA's Wonder Years to be witty, cleaver and entertaining.  In an age of punch lines every 30 seconds or bullets raging and unrealistic super heroes all out to win the girl, some where the art of intelligent story telling has become too formula.  Then came The Dish.  The characters draw you in because you can truly relate to them; their hopes, their losses, their accomplishments.  The humor is more genuine and lasting.

I've seen this movie probably 30 or more times. It makes me want to fly to Australia to Parkes, NSW. I'm dead serious. Everything from the live footage of JFK & Apollo/Eagle space scenes to the happy true story ending & everything in between makes this a 5+ star movie.",1383696000,,572,4.563106796116505

Unique perspective on an often overlooked, but critical component of the early efforts of man to put a man on the moon. Humerous portrayal with many of the facts accurately portrayed, but there were some significant license taken with the actual details. Some critical tracking stations and Australian participants that were not mentioned.

It's about a real story: the essential role that a small Aussie town played in the transmission of the video of the first moon walk in 1969. Without the location of their satellite, people around the world would not have seen Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon because the Apollo 11 spacecraft would have been outside the range of the American satellite.

The movie relates the humorous events of this little-known history. One of the most humorous scenes is when the Aussies accidentally play a Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass song for the supposed American national anthem. Whether or not all the events are accurate doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the movie. It's sweet, funny, patriotic and touching!",1367366400,,837,4.853146853146853

The story is BASED on the true events and very accurately portrays the times, the people and the culture. One of my favorite movies.  Comparing the 60's technology with today's technology makes it even more amazing. Comparing the culture to today makes me a bit sad for things lost and not understood today.

And it IS a comedy. A very pleasant and funny comedy. No potty humor for those who like that sort of thing.  Nothing crass (or not much). No ""belly laughs"".  Great characters and dialog. And very nicely scored music, direction and photography.

The year is now 2012, and the world is in greater turmoil, pain, discord, than ever before. If I were an astronaut on the Space Station, I'd hijack that bird and fly off to another realm, so far removed from this woebegone planet. The most compelling moment of The Dish, is the far shot of Planet Earth from the surface of the moon: a portrait of blue and white; oxygenated, so alone and alienated, most precious, floating in the vast and dark universe.

The plot centers around a remote town in Australia that is providing a communication link with Apollo 11, the first manned trip to the moon.

This wonderful little film and its period soundtrack brought back vivid memories of that night (well, it was night where we were) in July of 1969 when we all sat and watched those pictures from the moon.  I only wish I'd known then about the crucial role played by that dish in Australia.  Great script, fine acting and endearing characters.  I liked the film so much I bought an extra DVD copy to have in case the first one wore out!",1318204800,2,516,4.288659793814433
1424926,5,B00005BJCB,"I can't believe that when I wanted to buy this movie, I had to settle for a used copy (unless I wanted to pay $35 or more for a hoarded new copy).  This wonderful Australian film really deserves a DVD re-issue.  As a note, it is available on amazon streaming for $2.99, but I wanted a DVD.

This is based on a true story, so you know how it's going to end. But like ""Apollo 13"", knowing how it's going to end doesn't stop it from being a great story.

The tag line on the DVD is ""The First Step on the Moon Nearly Stumbled on Earth"". It's July 1969, and Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are going to be the first humans ever to step on the lunar surface. NASA is prepared.  A camera is going to film those first steps and everybody on earth will be able to watch it on their televisions. Two Australian satellite dishes are prepared to accept and relay the moonshot-video when the NASA satellite dishes in the U.S. are on the wrong side of earth to receive them. The Dish outside the town of Parkes, Australia, set up in the middle of a sheep paddock, is really just a back-up to the other Australian dish, and besides, the moonwalk isn't scheduled to take place until the U.S. dish will be in line to accept the transmissions.

But then the astronauts decide to move up the walk  -  they're too excited to sleep, for pete's sake  -  wouldn't you be?!  So the walk will take place when the Australian dishes are in line for the transmissions.  Then, oh boy, the primary Australian dish has a problem and goes off-line.  That leaves The Dish in Parkes responsible for relaying this world-altering incredible video to NASA, then to be broadcast to everyone's TV set worldwide.  No pressure - HAH!

With hours to go before the walk, the power in Parkes goes out due to a gale wind. Then their back-up generator doesn't work due to a maintenance mistake. What the sam hill are they going to do?  Or to be specific, what is Sam Neill going to do, because he plays The Dish's lead scientist/mathematician, Cliff Buxton.

I am a Sam Neill fan, and he doesn't disappoint in his portrayal of this understated leader. I also love Patrick Warburton, and here he plays it straight, a NASA scientist who arrives at Parkes as an advisor/NASA representative during the Apollo mission. The whole cast is fabulous, and there's wonderful characterizations, including the irrepressible Mayor of Parkes, played by Roy Billing.

A highly recommended family movie that is smart and witty, has comedy and tension and does a great job of documenting how important this was.

I live in a country neighborhood where no broadband or cable service is available.  We have a covenant related to satellite dish visibility, but since it is a densely wooded neighborhood, residents may have limited options for dish placement, which can make tempers flair.  The opening scene of this movie is pure delight as an aged Sam Neill walks down a tree lined country lane not unlike ours to revisit the spot of his past achievement and we are greeted with the most shockingly huge satellite dish most of us will ever see.  It was a sensational opening and it immediately made our local dish concern seem small by comparison.

The story of the film is a fictionalized true story about a quiet little Australian town, completely unused to the limelight, finding themselves a critical part of the Apollo 11 moon landing event because of their dish, and thanks to them we all saw the 'small step for man'.  What a charming way to remind us of all the regular people that make up these larger than life events.  They do their best, they make mistakes, they hold their collective breath hoping things work out and they learn to take themselves a little less seriously.  What a great lesson.

And it wasn't done without a hitch.

in The Dish, you learn the story of the small crew of Aussie engineers and the representative from NASA as they first lose contact with Apollo 11 and hide that fact long enough to recover, and then have to deal with tolerance exceeding winds for the dish.  In the meantime, the local residents and politicians slowly recognize their contribution to this historic event.

The local mayor has no idea what to call the American Ambassador and in a moment of complete hilarity, the satellite glitches just in time for the dignitary to arrive there as well.

""The Dish"" is one of those films you can watch when you need a good laugh and smile on your face when it's over.  It reminds you of the good in people, their willingness to work worldwide for a common goal, and their willingness to overcome cultural and technical obstacles.

1424942,5,B00005BJCB,"I cannot tell you how much I love this movie.  There have been so many other wonderful reviews that give the synopsis of the movie that I will not add more in this one.  I am from another Australian county town called Mudgee, about 2 hours drive from Parkes and the people, the area and the attitudes as shown in the movie were just the same in my home town in 1969, as I am sure they were in country towns in the US, Canada and Great Britain.  I was 5 when men first walked on the moon and was as avid a space nut as Billy is in the movie, glued to the TV and remembering all the details from the newspapers of the day and further days of the space program.  What I don't actually remember from the day, I remember from reruns but my partner was 12 at the time and remembers that day like it was yesterday.  A group of us sat down last night to watch The Dish again to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the moon landing and were struck, yet again, by what a brilliant movie it is.  I am so proud of it as an Australian, and pleased to see that it is appreciated all around the world.  Parkes is now a larger country city (in fact so much so that the filmmakers had to use the smaller nearby town of Forbes for some of the scenes in the towns streets during the film) and no where near ""the Outback"".  I noticed a few of the US reviews mentioning Parkes as being in the Outback but I'm afraid you would have to travel another 5 or so hours from Parkes to get close.  To drive from Sydney to Parkes would take about 4 hours.  Australia is a BIG country.  Have a look at Google Maps for a bit of an idea.  But I digress..If you want to see a great movie do yourself a favour and watch The Dish.  If you love it and enjoy the dry Australian sense of humour try some other projects from the same team that bought you The Dish. There is The Castle (movie), Hollowmen (Comedy TV Series set in a fictional Australian Prime Ministers department), Kath & Kim (Satirical TV Series featuring the lives of an Australian domestic goddess and her gaudy daughter) and Thank God You're Here (improvised comedy TV Series - similar to Whose Line is it Anyway?).",1248048000,,2143,4.147342995169082

In my lifetime so far it is the Kennedy Assasination and the Landing on the Moon. I remember exactly where and when those moments touched me. The significance of this movie is it shows the part that the Australians at the Parkes radio dish played in the Apollo 11 flight and landing on the moon.

Many people including myself didn't realize how significant that role was before this movie because NASA didn't really advertise the fact that Parkes was so instrumental in sending the TV signal received from the moon. Sam Neill and the rest the cast really make you feel you were there. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. Great story, cast, sets, and music make it well worth seeing.

1424946,5,B00005BJCB,"Easily my favourite Aussie movie.

The original score, soundtrack and cast performances are all outstanding, and the final scenes, where the Dish finally picks up the TV signal from the moon and starts transmitting, brings a tear my eye every time.

The humour is very Australian. Having read a few other reviews on this site, I see that our American cousins have a bit of trouble with it, but that is understandable - Aussie humour is very subtle and understated.

""Halt, who goes there..."" shouts the security guard... a few seconds pause and ""Bhaaaaaa..."" replies the sheep - it cracks me up every time I see that.

And another...

""How do you think they go to the toilet up there?"" asks one bloke. ""Don't know, maybe they hold on to it..."" says a second bloke. A third bloke looks at the rock-cake he is eating and says ""Maybe they should try eatin' one of these... it'll block 'em up for a week..."" - classic!

One minor disappointment is that, having bought a copy of The Dish from Amazon, I see that the US DVD release is slightly different from the Australian release. The US release doesn't have many special features - the Aussie version is packed with extra actual footage and documentaries - but most upsetting was that the US version has two scenes removed, both involving the mayor's daughter.

In the ""party"" scene, the radical daughter is talking to another guest (an old man with a grey beard) and she is criticising the US for waisting money on the space program. Both scenes are actually very funny, but I suppose the US distributors didn't like the idea of having any scenes where Americans are criticised... a pity realy, as removing those scenes does detract from the whole experience.

1424951,5,B00005BJCB,"This film, although critically aclaimed, does not (yet?) have the following it deserves!  Based on actual events, and very suitable for family viewing (even educational!), THE DISH is a warmhearted look at how a small town in Australia deals with having a world-wide spotlight focused on it while dealing with technical upheavals.

The event is America's first lunar landing.  The satellite dish of the title is located in the middle of a sheep paddock in rural Australia, and is the only one of a handful of facilities capable of relaying video footage from the moon.  Admittedly, this sounds pretty small now, but in 1969, this was heady stuff.  The DISH personnel, the townspeople, the VIPs who flooded in for the occasion are all wonderfully represented.

Sam Neill heads a cast of character actors all of whom turn in perfect performances.  Patrick Warburton, known as Agent T in Men in Black II - among other roles, is terrific as the NASA 'expert' regarded by the locals as a stuffed shirt.  And the scenes of the crew playing cricket are priceless.

I rented THE DISH for two reasons:  I well remember the moon landing, and I enjoy watching Sam Neill work.  I was very pleased on both counts.  It may remain a 'best kept secret' in an age when films seem to be bent on outdoing each other with action, gore, and special effects.  I sincerely hope not - this is worth watching more than once.

Overall, the film - which does have a few tense moments - is a gem that depicts ordinary people reacting to some very extraordinary circumstances.  It's gentle comedy makes its point.  Low key?  Yes.  Boring?  NO!  It's nice to see the good guys finish FIRST!",1214870400,,1660,4.678200692041522

1424954,5,B00005BJCB,"I recently saw this movie on cable and didn't expect much from it.  The caption listed the movie as a comedy and I found this unusual especially since Sam Neill was playing the lead role.  So I took it with a grain of salt and plopped myself down one evening to watch it.

While I was expecting a slap-stick cheesy comedy, I found instead a light hearted drama based on a different side of a famous historical event that I and perhaps many don't know about.

In a nutshell, the movie centers around the going on events at the Parkes Observatory in Australia during the events of the July 1969 moon walk.  The movie gives and excellent perspective of those events, seen from the people that actually captured the transmission via Parkes' enormous 200' diameter radio receiver.  What more is what effect this world riveting event had on the small town of Parkes.

The movie does take a light hearted side to this roll and it does remind us that these people who ran the Parkes installation were human and capable of error.  While the events may not be all factual, it does heighten the interest in the movie.

While the movie is less of a comedy than stated, there are instances that did get a chuckle out of me.  The movie did start out by showing that the Parkes installation is in the midst of a sheep paddock and that did give me a good laugh because of the irony that Parkes is located in South Wales and back in England's Wales, there is a roller coaster (Megaphobia) also built in a farm animal paddock where there is no amusement park in sight.  So as they said in the movie as well as in real life, it makes one wonder...why build such a large radio antenna in that location.

There are other humorous moments as well but I will not delve into details here as to give away spoilers.  But I will say that the movie is more drama than comedy.

The movie did go to great lengths to feature its main attraction in glorious detail, which is the Parkes Observatory Dish itself.  The camera angles do justice in exemplifying the shear size of the antenna dish.

Finally is the coverage of the moon landing and moon walk itself, which is excellently put together towards the end of the movie.

After seeing the movie, I was amazed to find out that much of it is very true.  There are several levels of poetic license thrown in for good measure as the story IS fiction but centers around true events.  There are some historical inaccuracies in minor events (which again I will not give away due to the fact that it may be considered a spoiler).  But those inaccuracies would only be given away by those that really know their history.

The soundtrack for the movie is also excellent.  They picked out a good selection of songs that you don't hear often today, but were popular back then. So kudos to the producer for that move instead of hammering out songs that are constantly played on the radio (from that era).

All in all, the movie is a must see and is an enjoyable experience.",1205712000,,2981,4.429357798165138

Central characters include a quiet, professorial dreamer, a working-class technician, a love-struck mathematician, and a NASA representative who cooperates in a bit of deception. Townsfolk consist of well-drawn characters, who were they not Australian, could have been drawn by Norman Rockwell.

Set in the runup to the first landing on the Moon, it centers on the various characters in the small Australian town of Parkes which houses the huge dish that will - power cuts and miscalculations notwithstanding - beam the live TV pictures to Earth. Or at least that's the plan. It starts off well with a number of scenes that manage to mix cleverly exposition with character-defining humor, but it's not long before you notice that the film is spending so much of its running time setting up the situation and filling in all the background details needed for the jokes to pay off that you begin to get impatient for them to just start the story. Yet second time round it's much easier to see the film's appeal and take it to your heart as it celebrates the best in its characters without belittling them, with Edmond Choi's score managing to beautifully underline the aspiration of the era.

Anyone with experience at Arecibo in Puerto Rico or the VLA (very large array) in New Mexico or any of the other big dish locations will want to see this movie about the big dish (radio telescope) in Parkes, Australia and how it was used to receive the moon landing images.

It is a great example of how good a movie can be that has no sex, no violence, no car chases, no profanity (well, a few minor cusswords from upset scientists - but hardly the stream of F words littering many other scripts these days), and no drugs beyond a little pipe smoking and booze. It's funny, it's intense, it's emotional, it's suspenseful. It's everything a movie should be.

Sam Neill is wonderful in this movie. All the characters sparkle, even the smallest roles are really well acted and well thought out.

What many of us don't realise however, is how close the world came to not actually seeing that historic event, and this delightful movie is the story of how it was that we did and can remember it to this day.

The dish in question is a very large satellite dish, in the middle of a sheep field, in country Australia (and where incidentally, it still stands today). It is the story of the people who operated it - a collection of intelligent and dare we say, nerdy men who tracked Apollo 11 with less computing power than most of us have in our personal organisers.

This has the potential to be a phenomenally boring film; however it is completely the opposite.  It is charming, witty, and even manages to generate a little suspense as the big event looms.  It is an absolute gem.

While untold millions watched the tube from around the world with unprecedent anticipation of Neil Armstrongs walk on the moom.

Two things:

- The film is an education on the often subtle but important differences between Australian and US cultures (I instantly noticed there are strong similarities to Anglo-Canadian life). This is a nostalgia-drenched trip down Aussie memory lane. Particularly interesting is how Australia of 1969 seems more like the US of around 1950 or even earlier. It's a bit disorienting and if you watch this with younger people you might want to give them a little background. This hardly seems like the same world also inhabited by the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Jimmy Hendrix.

- The film is a good kick in the hinder about what that moon landing meant to all of us and how tragic it is that a generation plus has not seen its equivalent. The Apollo landings marked the end of an age of exploration that had begun 500 years earlier; none of us back then could have anticipated how disinterested and unambitious humanity would have become in only 40 years.",1185062400,2,1059,4.682795698924731

1424976,4,B00005BJCB,"I orginally discovered ""The Dish"" when a neighbor brought this unknown movie over to watch with us one evening. I was interested in the subject matter having taught Astronomy at the college level and also spent considerable time in Australia. So, we put it in the DVD player, and an amazing thing happened: We really were taken back to 1969, and our surroundings, and the people we were with, were as real as life.

This movie title provides no evidence just how much you will take away from it. As an American, it gave me a taste of the pride and sense of accomplishment we all felt as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon. (Before ""America Bashing"" became popular, mostly among the members of our own media.) As a human being, it brought back that amazing day in July 1969 when we all broke the bonds of gravity and watched one of us walk on another planet (well, moon, actually...) for the first time in history.

The movie brings out all the small events, triumphs, and errors, that combine to make any great achievement possible. It tells the stories of the 'regular' people of Parkes, a small town in New South Wales, who, by doing their jobs, helped bring the images of the first steps on the moon to eyes all over the world.

It examined the most intriguing questions that needed be answered before we took the steps away from our Earthly home; like: ""How do they go wizzz up there?"" (Evidently remains unknown to this day!) Or, "" Without the co-ordinates, how do we find the Moon?"" (Answer; Look out the window!) And, ""Is this mission really funded by the CIA?"" (Answer: Not completely.)

From the NASA project manager who is terrified that he'll screw up his big opportunity, and the engineer who forgot to prime the fuel pump on the back-up generator, to the love struck mathematician who tries to ask the love of his life for a date and the mayor's 'radical' daughter who is convinced that everything is a CIA/imperialist plot, the cast brings the characters to life and leaves the viewer with a real feeling of having been there sharing it all with them.

The sound track makes us feel like it really is 1969. The choice of music is perfect. You will really laugh, and there may be a few tears of pride and happiness as you watch the very believable cast bring 1969 small town Australia to life. One of the best movies I have ever seen. You'll watch it over and over.",1172966400,,2391,4.5

It has touches of romance as the awkward Glenn Latham (Tom Long) asks the local beauty, Janine (Eliza Szonert) on a first date; comedy when the Dish looses track of Apollo 11 and they fake a transmission for U.S. Ambassador Howard (John McMartin); drama in the way ""we stuck to it"" and caught Armstrong stepping onto the Moon, despite the winds that could have blown the 1000 tons of antenna down and killed the crew.
The use of actual locations helped to make the film more credible and it  was fun to see the Australian idiom translated for the bemused American, Al (Patrick Warburton).

The Dish a nice feel good family film, by no means great cinema, but a joyous postcard of history.

A slice of Australia, dotted with pertinent language and cultural quirks.  Plenty of beautiful rural scenery.

Much light comedy, but an undertone of the gravity and urgency of that great undertaking.  Some sub-plots in play -- a little romance, politics, etc.  Nice combination.

What most of them didn't know, however, was that the images on their TV screens were being transmitted through a giant satellite dish that was sitting in the middle of an Australian sheep farm.  The 2000 comedy ""The Dish"" tells the story of the less-than-brilliant men who operated the crucial piece of equipment and the NASA official who nervously supervised them.  Sam Neill (""Jurassic Park"") plays the Australian in charge of the dish, while Patrick Warburton (the voice of wheelchair-bound Joe on ""Family Guy"") is the uptight NASA official.  ""The Dish"" mixes fiction with fact, giving the story both light, funny moments involving the characters, and exhilarating, inspirational scenes of the moon landing that many of us, having been born well after 1969, are too young to have experienced firsthand.",1147046400,,958,5.044303797468355

1424984,4,B00005BJCB,"Only having been four years old when the first lunar landing took place, I have no recollection about the excitement that surrounded this monumental achievement. So many men and women had dedicated their very lives to this one moment in time that it stopped the world (not just one nation) and allowed all of us the chance to see just how far human beings could go in their quest to reach that next horizon. And although THE DISH is about one backward country radio telescope in Parkes, Australia that beamed those first Armstrong-on-the-moon images to billions of people ...it is much more than that.

Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill, JURASSIC PARK) is the director of the Parkes telescope, a sensitive piece of hardware surrounded by sheep paddocks. Seeing such a large array (this telescope could actually deliver telemetry, track the lunar module, AND send back television images) in an austere landscape made me pause several times during the film and marvel at the sheer beauty of this monstrosity against the setting of Australia's back country.

Initially the film takes on the feel of something homey; a gentle side-trip down a path we all know too well (the first manned mission to the moon.) These hick-like folk are in charge of something as important as the lunar landing?! But the viewer gets pulled into the film in a very intimate way. We see that these ARE simple people, but ones who take their jobs very seriously ...but not overly so. The comedy, like the movie itself, is light and sprinkled throughout the relationships (even when they lose Apollo 11 as they approach the moon and lie to NASA about it!)

I found myself getting choked-up as the world - and this little microcosm of people in Parkes - held their breath as those first pictures of man's footprint on the moon took place (during hurricane force winds that threatened to blow over the telescope and kill the men inside operating it; they realized the importance of that moment and were willing to risk everything.)

If you'd like to take a trip down memory lane (ala 1969) but want a different road, THE DISH is a nice film to try out. Highly recommended.",1137715200,2,2132,4.754054054054054
1424985,4,B00005BJCB,"When I was a kid, I inherited my uncle's collection of newspaper clippings about space exploration.  I found it both interesting and inspiring to carry on a tradition of tracking the Space Race from the 50s and 60s through modern times.  Unfortunately, it rapidly became time consuming as more and more articles were written about the space shuttle and space exploration in general.

Then the rest of real life distracted me. It was too hard to keep investing in something that just wasn't as exciting.  Where were the manned space stations the size of cities?  The helpful flying robots?  The visitation to strange alien planets?

Eventually, I gave up.  And that pretty much sums up the state of space exploration today.

It's easy to forget the magic and wonder of the moon landing.  600 million people watched the event around the globe.  SIX HUNDRED MILLION. There isn't any televised event in my experience to date that I can compare to that.

Of course, the moon landing was about much more than just flying to the moon.  It represented democracy as a viable product of superior technology over communism.  It represented the triumph of the human spirit over the daunting physical barriers of the void. And it represented the arrival of science as a force to be reckoned with, achieving something thought impossible.  In essence, it was the biggest PR moment in the history of science, and the whole world was watching.

The reason the whole world saw anything besides static is because of a little town known as Parkes, Australia.  Located opposite the U.S. on the globe, Parkes is ideally positioned to pick up signals from the moon landing. Surrounded by a sheep paddock, three scientists find themselves tasked with the awesome job of acting as backup to the U.S. broadcasting system.

Thus we have an ideal character study, with four personalities in very cramped conditions under extreme pressure. There's Cliff Buxton (Sam Neil), the sad professor and patriarch of his little group.  Cliff lost his wife a year before and is finally learning to let go.  We have the fiery-tempered Ross ""Mitch"" Mitchell (Kevin Harrington), who bristles at American arrogance.  Then there's the shy but brilliant Glenn Latham (Tom Long), who has a crush on Janine Kellerman (Eliza Szonert) but doesn't have the courage to ask her out.  Finally, there's Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton), the NASA representative and American icon--always in a black suit, with the trademark black-rimmed glasses and disapproving glare.

You wouldn't expect much excitement or action from a huge piece of equipment that moves at a few feet a minute, but The Dish manages to convey just that.  It starts out slow, but there's a master plan: the contrast between the titanic machinery of the dish with the rolling countryside, the flat colors with the bright palette of the small town, the sophisticated scientists with the lovable country folk.  Throughout, we're reminded that this is science at its best and worst.  It's a miracle that anybody really does make it to the moon...and yet we can barely keep one broadcasting station running.

And that's the message of The Dish: When you think about it, the world is a very tiny place in this great big cosmos. If everyone kept that perspective, they might try getting along better.

In these turbulent times, we could all learn something from The Dish.",1134950400,3,3376,4.948490230905861

It was the perfect choice. Light, but not shallow, the film covers a few days in 1969 when a radio telescope observatory in a small, remote Australian town became a pivotal link in the Apollo 11 mission.

1425001,4,B00005BJCB,"These days, many fine films have a more 'regional' style, as some say.  For example there's ""Waking Ned Divine"", ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" and many other similar films that tend to be comedies and centered in one specific region.  The Dish is no different, as it takes a mostly comedic look at the true story of Parkes, Australia's help with the Apollo moon-landing mission.

See, in Parkes there is this satellite dish, and at the time it was one of few dishes that could beam TV, due to its large size.  Thus, this is no one simple event, as the whole, little town gets involved and excited for every up and down preperation and so on, because their dish is going to be part of something big.

For Americans, the most notable, or familiar, actor in the bunch is Sam Neill (Jurassic Park 1&3).  His character is the head of the dish station, and is kind of like the center of it all.

Yet, this story is based on many characters, they're all pretty funny, and those who aren't are odd enough, or homely enough, to where you just have to laugh.

The moon landing is to be broadcast on television, but the only satellite dish in the southern hemisphere that's poweful enough to transmit and recieve the signals happens to be in the tiny town of Parkes, Australia.

It's the characters, however, and not so much the story, that make up the richness and humor of the movie.  From the self-important mayor of Parkes, to the calm and collected American sent by NASA, to the bumbling security guard, everyone is hilarious.  All of the actors were very gifted, as well.

It's humble, and it's triumphant.

Loosely based on the goings on at The Parkes Radio Telescope in NSW's Central West during the days leading up to the launch of Apollo 11, and man's first steps on the moon.

It stars Sam Neill (Jurassic Park, Dirty Deeds) as the director of operations at the telescope, and Patrick Warburton (TV's Seinfeld & The Tick, Men in Black II) as the last guy from NASA left to overview Australia's part of the radio transmissions.

There are a bunch of other characters in key roles played by actors familiar to Australians, but no one really as notable as the previous two mentioned.

This is directed by Rob Sitch who also directed ""The Castle"" which is another classic Australian movie, but nowhere near as classy as this one.

If you are looking for other great Australian titles, check out THE CASTLE (recommended by Rob Schneider & Adam Sandler! - Michael Caton was in ""The Animal), LANTANA & DIRTY DEEDS.

Anyway, back to this one.

The actors do an excellent job making each character believable, the story is well written and well paced, and the photography is beautiful.

The soundtrack by Edmund Choi, and performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is wonderfully in synch with the images, as well as a collection of 60's rock music that puts you right in the ""time frame"" of mind, including 2 songs by 60's Australian artist Russell Morris featured in the opening montage (""The Real Thing"") and in the closing credits (""On the Wings of an Eagle"").

I think the soundtrack is available on Amazon.com too, so if you enjoy the movie, you might want to have a look at that as well.

The Parkes Radio Telescope is located in the middle of some beautiful scenery, and it just looks fantastic on the screen.

I've been out to ""The Dish"" several times as I have family that now live in Parkes, and it is as beautiful out there in real life, as it looks on screen.

There is just enough humor in the movie to make it a pure pleasure to watch, and Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton are excellent, as are the rest of the actors. A definite must for anyone who wants to know more about Apollo 11 or just enjoys a good drama-comedy.",1077667200,,692,4.323076923076923

Cue lots of little things like wrong equations because Oz is upside down, or is it Houston that is upside down?, and you got yourself a thriller.

Despite near fatal glitches and other mishaps, the small Aussie team does not fail to deliver the hometown its moment of glory.  Nor does the movie fail to charm despite its lack of either heavy drama or boisterous comedy.

In terms of the movie itself, Sam Neill carries it on his quite capable back.  It depicts the far-flung and often unexpected way in which the 1969 Moon landing brought the world together, united in fellowship and good spirit, for a brief moment in time.

By the end I was both smiling and a little teary with pride for everyone who participated in the lunar landing, and for humankind.
Second, I loved the portrait of small town Australia. The characters were very realistic. I love the Aussie sense of humor and this film had me giggling quite often. I also loved the various quirky townspeople.
Third, it resonated with me as a scientist. The rush to get something done properly and on time, the frantic scribbling on a blackboard...these are all parts of life for me, and it's comforting in a way to know that even the people in charge of the big stuff go through the same frustrations and triumphs.

1425028,5,B00005BJCB,"A very good film.  Sam Neill stars as the head man at an Australian tracking station responsible for transmitting the first live television images from the lunar surface in July 1969.
In this writer's estimation, Mr. Neill gives a very solid, understated performance here.  The perfect touch given Neill by the filmmakers was the addition of his ever-present pipe.  He's rarely without his trusty companion.  IMO, that pipe gives his character more ""character"", if you will.  It seems the perfect prop for this characterization.
An assortment of adept supporting players are on hand here as well, providing genuine moments of humor, and tenderness, throughout.  The neighborhood ""boy soldier"" (who's dying to get into some sort of military duty) is a howling treat!
This film offers a near-perfect blend of laughs and drama.  Plus a very nice 60s musical score to boot!
I thoroughly enjoyed this 101-minute ride to the moon on ""The Dish""!
Although offering little in the way of extra features (save the trailer and some cast notes), I would also give the DVD performance a thumbs-up as well.  Nice full 5.1 surround sound, and an excellent anamorphic widescreen picture are on tap here.

1425030,5,B00005BJCB,"On July 20, 1969, one of the most impressive achievements in human history occurred when the entire world witnessed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first two human beings to ever walk upon an extraterrestrial world: Earth's moon.  Television images were transmitted from Tranquility Base, the landing point for the Apollo 11 Lunar Module ""Eagle"", using a small, low-powered television transmitter to send live pictures of the historic event back to Earth.  Because the signal was so low-powered, only the largest radio-telescopes on the Earth had the necessary gain to amplify and receive the transmissions.  Since the Earth rotates, multiple radio-telescope stations were used on different continents to receive the signals when they were in a position to observe the moon. (This is commonly called ""line of sight"".)
Films such as ""Apollo 13"" (1995) and ""The Right Stuff"" (1983), as well as the TV mini-series ""From the Earth to the Moon"" (1998), all focused primarily upon the exploits of the astronauts during the early years of NASA, whose primary mission was, as spoken by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961, ""before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""  Of course, the astronauts were not the only people responsible for the achievements of the Apollo program; there were engineers, technicians and many other people, including a handful of people working at the  radio-telescope station located in a sheep paddock in the small farming community of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia.
Many people are unaware that Australia played a pivotal role with the Apollo 11 moon landing back in July, 1969; but in 2000, director Rob Stitch created a wonderful and entertaining film called ""The Dish"" capturing the critical contribution that Australia made with its radio-telescope in Parkes.  Revisiting the Parkes radio-telescope decades after the historic moon landing is the retired Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill).  He thinks back to those critical days in July, 1969 when he managed the radio-telescope and was assisted by technicians Ross 'Mitch' Mitchell (Kevin Harrington), who was responsible for maneuvering the large dish antenna, and the shy Glenn Lathom (Tom Lang), who worked the receiving equipment.  NASA also sent a representative, Al Bartnett (Patrick Warburton), to both coordinate the radio-telescope with NASA personnel and supervise the station during the Apollo 11 mission.  At NASA's request, a local man is hired to be a security guard, Rudi (Tayler Kane), to protect the station during the mission.
Prior to the Apollo 11 mission, activities at the Parkes radio-telescope are very relaxed. Cliff often climbs onto the dish to relax and smoke his favorite pipe, while Mitch and Glenn practice playing cricket on the dish.  In one humorous scene during the Apollo mission, when the U.S. Ambassador (John McMartin) is leaving the station after a visit and the dish antenna is being lowered to point towards the horizon, a cricket ball rolls off the dish antenna in front of Cliff Buxton.  Other fun aspects of the film involve the townspeople of Parkes, its mayor & his wife, the U.S. Ambassador and the Australian Prime Minister.
Things heat up considerably at the radio-telescope one night while they are tracking and receiving signals from the Apollo 11 spacecraft en route to the moon: a power outage across the Parkes area causes all of the equipment within at the radio-telescope to shut down because a backup generator fails to come on.  After power is restored, all of the eqipment comes back on, but the settings and computer program being used to determine the location of the Apollo 11 spacecraft are lost.  Frantic, Glenn and Cliff try for hours to recalculate where the Apollo 11 should be so that they will know where to point the antenna when Parkes has clear line of sight again.  Unable to perform their calculations fast enough using slide rules, Al looks out a window and tells them to simply try pointing the dish at the moon, which they can see with their eyes. With no other options, Mitch points the huge antenna towards the moon, then slowly moves the antenna around until they reacquire the signal from Apollo 11.
Things heat up again the next day, July 20, just prior to Parkes again coming into view of the moon in time to receive the all-important moonwalk TV signals.  Can the crew of the Parkes radio-telescope keep things together to receive the most important transmission of all?  Watch this fun and exciting Australian film and find out!
I highly recommend ""The Dish"" to anyone that loves the history NASA, astronomy and the Apollo moon landings, but I'm sure that most people will enjoy this film regardless.  Many thanks go to the director, producer, actors and crew that brought this film to life showing the often overlooked and less glamorous people involved with the manned exploration of space.",1040083200,4,4917,5.035714285714286

The build-up to the Apollo 11's successful mission, as delivered by this script, is warmly personalized and made remarkably new. This is accomplished by some fine ensemble acting intercut with stock footage from around the world that is almost seamlessly blended into the narrative. Instead of looking very out of place, as most stock footage does, in this case the era is so nicely established by the costumes, the characters, the settings and especially the soundtrack, scenes shot back in July of 1969 seem very timely and appropriate. It's a credit to director Sitch that there's nothing maudlin about the film; it's low-key and sweetly amusing and yet surprisingly gripping. And it's particularly gratifying to see Sam Neill turn in an effectively low-key performance, after appearances in some pretty ghastly American films.
Recommended.",1030492800,35,992,5.20625
1425034,5,B00005BJCB,"""Charming"" is the word that describes best this little-seen film.  ""The Dish"" is about a small town Parkes, of which greatest pride, a big parabola (= ""The Dish""), actually biggest in the southern hemisphere, was selected in 1969 by NASA as the place to receive the signal from Apollo 11, the first spaceship that reaches the moon, and to transmit this epoch-making moment all over the world!  ""The Dish"" follows the behaviors of the people of the town (population about 7,000) where this honourable (but very responsible) task is allotted, and the scientists who work at the anntena station that (still now) stands in the middle of a sheep paddock.
What makes this film very heart-warming and pleasing is the characters it gives; Sam Neil plays the chief of the institute, Cliff, always with a pipe in hand, providing much better and amusing turn than in ""Jurassic Park"" and other Hollywood films, and beside him, Patrick Warburton, as an American scientist sent from NASA, plays Al (who looks like Dan Ackroyd with Buddy Holly glasses), whose presence at first is disliked by the original stuff, but gradually turns out a good guy.  The town's major is busy; his wife (in lemon-colored dress) chatting; and his son always watching TV.  An US Ambasssador comes (at the most awkward moment); and then Prime Minister is also coming!  The film gives each of these colorful characters a good, funny line or two to speak, and even love interest.
Besides this great merit, to me, the film are interesting in two respects; one is the slight cultural difference between Down Under and America, which is most vividly expressed in some foul words hurled at poor Al.  And more interesting is perhaps the reference to culture of the late 1960s, which is twisted with Australian humor (so I thought).  One certain guitarist is introduced as ""James Hendrix,"" and one famous TV theme song is mistaken for natinal anthem.
It is almost certain that many of the events in the script are made for the dramatic purpose by the creating team behind the film (though Rob Sitch takes the credit of director, it is rather those five members of popular ""Working Dog"" team which include Michael Hirsh, Jane Kennedy, Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauto, and Stich  that really should be regarded as the real genius behind the film).  Still, they manage the whole drama with a pace, not too fast, not too slow, always engaging.
Probably, the reality of the event was not as dramatic as the way the film shows.  But ""The Dish"" is so delightful that no one would complain of that.  And really, it is hard not to love this film, and the charming town and its people in Parkes.",1028937600,6,2637,4.760964912280702
1425035,5,B00005BJCB,This is a all time favorite movie of mine. Sam did a WONDERFUL job with this.

1425036,5,B00005BJCB,"If the Right Stuff was the epic story of the Space Program on a grand scale, then The Dish is the reduction of the story of the Apollo 11 landing to a very human scale. It centers around the role that a radio telescope in Australia played in receiving and relaying the actual television pictures from Apollo 11 to the Earth, and on the few people who actually struggled to get it done.
In a very quiet but moving way, it portrays how Apollo 11 did 'come in peace for all mankind', unifying humanity in a positive way as no other event in my lifetime. Sam Neil is absolutely at the peak of his fine acting abilities as the telescope's director, combining his dedication to the mission with a bittersweet sadness at the loss of his wife, and is supported by excellent performances by the cast. The directing and editing are so subtle as to make one forget it is a dramatization, and involve us in all these frail heroes. There is the initial misunderstanding and distrust between the NASA controller and the telescopes three primary Australian crew, and the artful way that Sam Neil's character overcomes it could serve as a leadership and crisis managment primer in any college curriculum.
Inevitable political grandstanding of the event and the small city of Parkes' role in it are sent up in gentle humor. One of the most elegant aspect's of this lovely ""small"" movie is that all of the characters are so deftly made real, and there are no shoddy charicatures.
This is a great tribute to Australian film making. If you are looking for a movie that will rejuvinate your faith in humans' ability to work together, this is it.
The visual and sound quality of the DVD are very fine, with a trailer and limited cast information as the only special features.",1023580800,,1753,4.603833865814696
1425037,5,B00005BJCB,"When this movie came to Houston, I didn't even know it existed. Then, two Aussie friends convinced me to see it with them. I think I was the only American in an audience of perhaps twenty Aussies, in the only theater in Houston showing the movie.
The movie begins with news footage from the 60s and the days of the Apollo moon missions, and as an Apollo buff, I was hooked immediately. The fundamental, factual story line concerns the use of the Parkes Radiotelescope in New South Wales, Australia, as the primary receiving station for Apollo 11's broadcast of Armstrong and Aldrin walking on the moon.
There's much more to this movie than a sidebar on Apollo 11, however. The primary characters are the people who run the telescope, and they're a very human, if not subtly quirky lot. The movie has several story angles including Aussie pride, Aussie politics, Aussie humor, and a little bit of innocent romance. Throughout the movie, the team manning Parkes grapples with technical problems, both self-inflicted and from Mother Nature, leaving you wondering if they'll actually pull off their small but not insignificant contribution to history. More importantly, the movie brings back memories of the awe the world felt as we watched two brave men become the first to set foot on another world.
Sam Neill is just right as Cliff, the fatherly radioastronomer who is the Parkes director. Since I saw the movie with Aussies, I learned that many of the bit parts are played by classic Aussie character actors. Everytime one of them appeared in a cameo role, the audience cooed with delight.
The cinematography is great and shows the rural New South Wales countryside at its best. The soundtrack contains numerous hits from the 60s and fits into the story well.
The movie is great for children, though I think it does contain a small amount of strong language (generally uttered in a classic, low-key, Aussie fashion).
Recently, I watched the movie again in high definition on HBO and was just as enthralled the second time as I was the first. I strongly recommend it.",1022284800,5,2066,4.838983050847458

Support of the NASA missions was given by many groups and companies, and this is an excellent view of the communications portion of it all. Very funny! I mean, I laughed a whole lot during this movie! It gives you great characters acted out superbly and with that Aussie laid-back nature.

For anyone who grew up in the 1960's with there eyes glued to the TV for every space shot this movie will certainly bring back the memories. Great music used in the background to set the mood. Maybe not 100% historically accurate, but it does get accross the riskiness of the entire chain of technology devoted to the lunar landings. The scenes and dialog in the dish control room during signal acquisition and tracking got the technological details right, which is always an area that most movies either screw up or blow way out of proportion. An example of this is when they try to acquire the video feed as early as possible as the moon is coming above the horizon. The moon is shown exactly where is should be, not at the horizon but considerably above it, and then the comment is made that the dish would be hitting concrete if it is positioned any lower, showing that the dish cannot physically point its axis at the horizon. A mention is then made to use the offset feed horn to skew the beam slighly lower. I just love it when they actually get this stuff right! As an aerospace engineer who devoted my life to this type of work due in a large part to the space program, I can highly recommend this movie!",1017878400,5,1403,4.338403041825095

1425041,4,B00005BJCB,"...then, hooo-boy did you pick the wrong movie.
This is a quiet, charming little character piece with no sex, no explosion, and real people doing real things.
For anyone born after 1962, it will be a revelation of how important the world thought it was to land on the moon. A history lesson, of a time out of memory or before you were born.
For those born earlier, this movie fulfills a dual function. It is a delightfully funny movie with dozens of interesting offbeat characters, and an intelligent plot. It is also the only film I've ever seen that accurately captures the often miserable broadcast quality of the moon landings. Most documentaries and films use footage that the astronauts themselves took on either film or better quality video. The actual broadcast we baby boomers saw live was a shadowy, grainy, nearly indecipherable mess.
Filmed on location on the 200-ft wide dish where the events took place, this movie scores big on the little touches: the security guard who is convinced that's Neil Armstrong on his walkie-talkie, the rather unusual selection for the American National Anthem, the cadet hopelessly infatuated with the mayor's rebel daughter, the father who has to keep asking his 8-year old son about the technical details of the moon launch. (Anyone who lived through the time knows how spot on that situation was.) The music choices, ranging from the Australian classic ""The Real Thing"" by Russel Morris to ""Good Morning Starshine"" by Oliver, are accurate for the era and appropriate.

This monumentally emotional moment for mankind, albeit thoroughly superfluous scientific achievement, is the background for this beautifully constructed film.
The thing that makes this film so special is the fact that there isn't a character that appears on screen that you don't care about, regardless how small the role. That takes true writing and directing talent!
The entire small town of Parks, New South Wales, Australia is all atwitter, because their radio observatory dish has been chosen to be NASA's official link to the Apollo 11 mission in the southern hemisphere. The mayor's wife comments, while serving her joint of lamb, that man being moments away from landing on the moon makes their problems seem mundane... That's the beauty of the film, you care so much about these people; their problems are anything but mundane - you cheer-on the techno-nerd asking the town beauty to go out with him; you ache inside because the head of the observatory lost his wife a year ago and she can't be there to revel in his glory; you love the fact that the out-of-place NASA official is the only one who realizes that all the mayor's rebellious teenage daughter really needs to chill-out is an ounce of respect.

This movie, in short, tells the story of the Apollo 13 moon landing from the point of view of the men that ran a giant radio telescope, known as 'The Dish', in Australia. This massive dish exists in a small town, and is situated in the middle of a sheep paddock. As this group of ragtag scientists begins to deal with the faraway NASA and the newfound publicity, much hillarity insues.
Sam Neill plays the leader of this group of scientists. As always, he's brilliant, his quiet yet intense style of acting very enjoyable and dryly humorous at times. He's backed up by a fantastic cast: Hevin Harrington, Tom Long, and Patrick Warburton. There's not a weak one in the bunch, and the strength of this ensemble film is one of the movie's high points.
I suggest giving this movie a shot - you'll certainly be in for a charming surprise. It's a well-written, witty film that will certainly please space movie and Australian film fans alike.",1008028800,7,1370,4.506024096385542

The old man bit left me cold, although by the end I saw why it was set up that way (among other things I hated the old man makeup--should memorize the person who did it's name so as to avoid her in the future). Didn't much care for the first bits with cutesy overplayed and overbearing small town yokels.  A good many of whom turn out to be neither cutesy nor yokels in the later parts.

1425046,3,B00005BJCB,"***1/2  ... I finally broke down and rented ""The Dish,"" a true story about the small group of men working at a satellite dish in a remote section of Australia who, in July 1969, played a major part in helping to transmit the first live images of a man walking on the moon.
I'm happy to report that ""The Dish"" turns out to be a world-class charmer, a delightful film that captures the high-spirited innocence and optimism of the space race era and vividly recreates a time when people from all over the world could do little but stare in spellbound amazement at the achievements of which mankind proved itself capable - and feel the mutual pride and camaraderie that such events occasioned.  The makers of ""The Dish"" dramatize this feeling of universal connectedness by showing how even the most remote, seemingly ""insignificant"" people could be made to feel a part of an event happening half a world away and commanding the attention of most of the planet's inhabitants.  Here near the small town of Parkes, Australia, nestled in what is little more than a sheep pasture, looms the 1,000-ton satellite dish that will serve as the eye of the world for this event of monumental historic importance.  The makers of the film have chosen to take a charming, low-key approach to the material, focusing on the likable, decidedly offbeat people who make up both the team at the dish as well as the citizenry of the nearby town.  With the subtle quirkiness common to most Australian comedies, ""The Dish"" displays a real affection for its characters, showing them as flawed human beings who, nevertheless, learn to accept and cope with the differences that might otherwise separate them.  Thus, even the simmering conflict between the American hotshot from NASA assigned to the dish and one of the more sensitive Aussie specialists plays itself out in a believable and touching way.  Other characters defy the stereotypes that less gifted filmmakers might have enforced upon them.  The mayor of the town, for instance, rather than being a self-congratulatory blowhard (as we fear he will become in the early parts of the film) turns out to be a sweet, gentle, family-loving man who is as overwhelmed by the world's spotlight being shone on his community as are the common folk who make up his constituents.  Lending his star quality to the proceedings, Sam Neil gives a beautifully understated performance as Cliff Buxton, a recently widowed technician at the dish who manages to take all this hubbub in stride but who conveys, in gentle ways, the sheer awesomeness of the event in which he finds himself taking part.  In fact, it is this sense of ordinary people suddenly finding themselves a part of history that makes ""The Dish"" more than simply a clever, likable comedy.  We find ourselves genuinely touched and moved by much of what we see on screen.
Perhaps, after the tragedy of the World Trade Center attacks - during which people all over the world sat riveted in morbid fascination to their television sets watching that horrifying event unfold - the film attains an added poignancy.  It reminds us a bit of our lost innocence as we see the people in this film staring spellbound at their television sets 32 years earlier for a far different purpose - to witness, as a united, worldwide community, the GOOD things mankind can do when he puts his mind to it rather than the evil.  By dealing so warmly and gently with the people who make up this little corner of the world, ""The Dish"" lifts the spirits and renews the faith.  ...",1002931200,51,3528,4.7717569786535305

However, it it was still fun to watch and had some serious ideas and a bit of the truth about real science and space missions.  It's hard to find movies like that which are suitable for kids.  I'd like to read the real story; a site which was critical of the movie recommends the following book: Tracking Apollo to the Moon by Hamish Lindsay.",1001894400,,506,4.195876288659794
1425048,5,B00005BJCB,"At times, we as Americans forget about some of our greatest heritage. We forget that at times the world has looked in awe and shared in our successes. ""The Dish"" is a story about one of those times. A family oriented - Australian placed- dromedy (drama-comedy) that reminds us of a time when people around the world were proud as human beings. That pride was given to the world from the United States.
Placed in Parkes Australia, in the middle of a sheep paddock, stands a 240 foot in diameter radio telescope. It was through this antenna alone that you and I were able to watch mans first steps on the moon. ""The Dish"" will renew your spirit and feelings of exhilaration experienced while watching mans first steps on the moon. The movie reaches into that hard to get, lost place in your heart by allowing us to see the moon landing from another perspective; The Pride of Parkes Australia.
For one priceless moment, all the people of this planet were truly one......Wouldn't it be nice to feel that way again today?
Do yourself a favor, watch ""The Dish"" and find that deep rooted American - Human Pride.

The dialouge clever and witty, but I couldn't expect less from Rob stich. I have alot of respect for Sam Neill. He has a tendency to go back and do these smaller films which is a good thing. Which is more than can be said for Mel Gibson. The only one who thinks he is Australias favourite son is him. The Croc hunter is closer to that title and that in itself says alot.

1425053,3,B00005BJCB,"While the movie is billed as based on ""a true story,"" the producers totally fabricated their accounts of the Parkes radio telescope support of Apollo 11. After viewing ""The Dish"" one might think that Parkes was critical to the Moon landing mission. It was NOT!
The Parkes 210-foot antenna DID provide the best TV coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. However, Parkes was not the only station in Australia to track Apollo 11. The primary support was provided by the Honeysuckle Creek Manned Space Flight station located in Canberra. Honeysuckle Creek handled the telemetry, command and voice communications with all Apollo spacecraft. Parkes was only used to provide slightly better TV coverage than obtainable with HSK's smaller 85-foot antenna.
Later, during Apollo 13, Parkes did play a very important role in recovering voice and telemetry data while the astronauts were stretching their battery life to safely return to Earth.
If one does not take this film for more than Aussie entertainment, it makes for a good 101 minutes of DVD enjoyment. Just keep in mind that it is FICTION.

1425054,4,B00005BJCB,"I was looking over the schedule at the Sundance Film Festival for 2000.  Among the offerings was a little noted movie featuring Sam Neill, one of my personal favorites.  I was delighted by the sense of the '60's and the gentle humor of the characters involved.  Perhaps it was strong language by Australian standards, but I found the language interplay between the Australians and the NASA rep really funny.  The musicians interpertation of the American National Anthem struck me as hysterical and somehow appropriate for the times.  All together it's a humorous and, for me a very nostalgic movie.  Well worth adding to my theater library.",998265600,,640,4.990566037735849
1425055,4,B00005BJCB,"""The Dish"" is a square-jawed, by the numbers, small-budget but Hollywood-styled look at a small town making good.  However, there are several elements that elevate it above its more pedestrian brethren.
The film focuses on a very global (or, more appropriately, universal) story from an odd angle.  Its Australian sheep paddock and surrounding small town is, both literally and figuratively, a half a world away from the scientists at NASA.  And yet they manage to be right there in the middle of a historic moment.  Now, I don't know the veracity of the narrative's claims, but frankly that doesn't matter.  It all seemed real (helped by substantial additions to the famous moonwalk footage, prior to the ""One small step for man"" line).
I'll refrain from using the clich that the dish itself was a character.  It's enough to say that it *has* character, stemming from the people who operate it.  There's a delicious scene near the beginning where two of the engineers have set up a cricket pitch at its hub.  This scene also does wonders in illustrating the enormous size of the thing, for the ball never comes close to going over the side, but rather rolls languidly back to the centre for another whack.  Director Rob Sitch has a wonderful time giving us odd angle views of the dish, whether it is shining in the afternoon sun against a backdrop of sheep, or lit up majestically in the night.  It is a wonderful visual centrepiece for the film.
There is a remarkable subtleness in the way the characters are revealed here.  One shining example is the revelation that Sam Neill's character makes about his past.  It is hinted at in several different moments, before he corroborates the evidence well into the movie.  The audience gets to know the character, intimately, before it can be trusted with his secret.  Not that the secret is by any means sordid.  It is just the kind of thing that another movie would use to manipulate the audience.  Here, you get none of that manipulation.  You just get another way of understanding the character better.
In speaking of character, I am reminded of my preconceptions regarding the movie.  It was marketed as a wacky and kooky Aussie romp.  Don't be fooled; it is none of that.  Rather, it is a simple comedy where much of the humour comes from character. There's Janine, the pretty girl whose daily sojourns to the dish to bring lunch are nearly halted by her complete inability to drive.  There's the mayor, who does his best to reign in his passion even while the eyes of the world are on his little burg.  There's the next door neighbour, a young man with military dreams, who goes through single-man formations in the backyard.  There's the security guard at the dish, who is equal parts determination and awkwardness.  And then there are the dish keepers themselves.  Four men who are different in demeanor (and in one case citizenship) but share an intimate dedication to the dish.  Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton are the faces you'll recognize here.  The other actors are unfamiliar to me, but all do bang-up jobs, especially Kevin Harrington as the possessive dish operator, and Tom Long as a terminally shy engineer with a crush on the comely Janine.
""The Dish"" will not stay with you for long after it's over.  But while you're watching, you won't be able keep the grin off your face.",997920000,3,3342,4.745233968804159

The actual moon landing is seen via grainy,often black and white news footage, which only enhances the nostalgia of the film. There is hilarity in the portrayal of some of the characters and there is also drama to underscore the importance of the event.

But, as the characters develop and the story neatly unfolds, The Dish becomes a light and enjoyable experience. The film gives us comedy without being too in-your-face.

1425066,5,B00005BJCB,"In this case, THE DISH is neither (in pass&eacute; slang) a gorgeous girl nor a plate for something edible. Rather, it's the radio astronomy dish in Parkes, New South Wales, Australia. It's also in a sheep pasture. (Watch where you step!)
It's July 1969, and Apollo 11 is on its way to the moon. THE DISH has been selected by NASA to receive the live pictures beamed back from the Sea of Tranquility as the astronauts step onto the lunar surface. It's to be a big day for the proud residents of Parkes, 364 km west of Sydney - out in the sticks, so to speak. The whole world will be watching, and ""their"" dish will bring the pictures home.
THE DISH is manned by Cliff, the facility's Director, and Glenn, Mitch and Rudi. Also present is Al, the NASA honcho sent as liaison to the locals. Blowing into town for the Big Event are the American Ambassador and the Australian Prime Minister. Mayor Bob and wife Maisie, hosts for the VIPs, are as proud as new parents - and not just a little nervous. I mean, your dish screws-up, and who on the globe isn't going to know?
This gentle Australian comedy is a reminder that a film can be funny and entertaining without the gross-out bathroom humor that seems de rigueur in Hollywood productions nowadays. It resembles delightful gems from the UK, e.g. LOCAL HERO, WAKING NED DEVINE and SAVING GRACE, notable for the quirkiness of their characters, though THE DISH is a little more understated in that regard (probably because it's based on fact). Sam Neill is sweatered Mr. Laid Back as Director Cliff, and Roy Billing is especially good as the enthusiastic Mayor Bob. Amidst both man-made and nature-made problems that crop up for THE DISH as Apollo 11's touchdown approaches, Patrick Warburton, as NASA's Mr. Expert, must weather the resentment pouring off local talents Glenn and Mitch, who see him as a Know-It-All Stuffed Shirt. Can they function as a team and win the day for the home crowd?
The film works because the storyline focuses more on THE DISH and the people of Parkes than on the moon landing itself. After all, we already know how the latter story came out. However, that said, the movie does effectively remind the viewer - especially if he/she is over 40 - of that singularly extraordinary day in July 1969 when, for the first time in history, the entire human species stopped, stood as a single entity, and held its collective breath to watch one of its own accomplish something quite wondrous. I know that I shall never see the likes of that again in my lifetime.

1425068,5,B00005BJCB,"It's a delightful film about teamwork and all the tensions and secrets not worth mentioning once you achieve success. It's not simply a comedy.  You'll find yourself getting caught up in the enthusiasm of the characters as the time for the moonwalk approaches.  The old footage and audio from the era and the 60's soundtrack add to the spirit of the movie. It's very touching to think that so many of us on the planet were united in common interest, hope and amazement in that historic event.  The Dish made you realize (or remember) what a remarkable scientific achievement was unfolding right before your eyes.  The quirky characters will make you laugh and the sense of comedic timing is masterful. The movie is very well put together.  Not a scene is wasted.  You'll enjoy yourself.

7937824,5,B00005BJCB,"I loved this movie.  While it got a lot of the details wrong, it was quite entertaining.

I'll start with the bad.  The main error in the movie was that it claims the tracking station at Parkes was the one that received the best pictures of Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon.  The truth is that it was the disk at Honeysuckle Creek, near Perth, that captured the images, including video that was much better than that seen on TV.  The second main error was the presence of NASA personnel, such as the fictional Al Burnett.  The only people manning the station were Australians.

Chalk it up to dramatic license.

Now for the good.  Sam Neill is BRILLIANT in this movie, showing he's just as good at comedy as he is at drama and action.  Patrick Warburton, as the aforementioned Al Burnett, makes an amazing foil for him.  While it was apparently a hit in Australia, it didn't get much play in the US until Netflix picked it up.
