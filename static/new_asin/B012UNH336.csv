you really know how to impress me

those guitar licks of yours

7358466,5,B012UNH336,Great video of Jimi Hendrix and lots of interviews with people about that 4th of July in 1970!!! Definitely a must-have for any fan of Jimi!!!,1446854400,4,142,4.5
7358467,5,B012UNH336,"This is the definitive release of Jimi from that era.  Excellent sound, excellent picture and excellent performance from Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox. I've had earlier versions from the show on ""Stages"" and ""Johnny B Goode"" and this version is outstanding.",1446768000,30,270,5.27906976744186
7358468,5,B012UNH336,"Electric Church music by James Marshall Hendrix:  The performance is good for Jimi, not great like his July 30, 1970 Hawaii concert or his Jan 1, 1970 Band of Gypsys concert but not bad either. He gives a set list of old classics like Foxy Lady, Purple Haze, Hey Joe and Fire and also incorporates ""All along the watchtower"" that was new to his shows in 1970, Jimi also welcomes new at the time, unreleased songs like Freedom, Room full of Mirrors, Straight Ahead and Hear my train a comin (though he had performed that song for many years at the time but never officially released). Where the Showtime feature and the DVD have their differences ONLY lies in the addition of 3 more songs to the video. Red House, a great blues standard by Jimi should have been in the Showtime feature, to have no blues on the set for Showtime was a disgrace as Jimi is not only one the best guitar players of all time he is also one of the best BLUES players of all time! This track was previously released on the short lived 1990 Japan only VHS version of the same show. This myth that this concert has never been released before and its all brand new is just a marketing ploy by Janie Hendrix and its so dishonest it makes me sick! There were 3 songs released in 1986 on the American VHS called ""johnny B. Goode"" so to suggest this is all ""NEW"" is just so bogus! Anyhow....the DVD also features 2 NEW video numbers never released before, that being ""Freedom"" and Room fill of mirrors"". Room full of mirrors is only partial video, the rest of the song uses ""filler"" images from the show. The audio is a excellent 5.1 mix done by the master himself, Mr Eddie Kramer! All his DVD mixes by Jimi are superb! You can also experience a great mix on the already released CD version of the show, it is far superior to the 1990 ""Stages"" box set show that was produced by Alan Douglas on Reprise records. This DVD is very well filmed and edited, in my opinion it ranks No. 2 in Jimi DVD's behind ""Wild Blue Angel"" as far as the film quality and show performance, though Woodstock is right up there as well but I feel the expanded ""band"" Jimi had put together wasn't very tight and muddled some of the show, this is Jimi in July 1970 just months before his un-timely murder in September 1970 (yes he was murdered incase you didn't know). This show has a relaxed Jimi, he said in interviews he loved playing in the south the best. Great concert, I just wish they had video footage of the whole show, ""Hear my Train"" and ""New Rising Sun"" are left out.
Enjoy!!",1444780800,58,2531,4.328421052631579

7358474,5,B012UNH336,Another episode in Jimi's life. A tantalising look at a soul who was obviously not really enjoying his role as he used to. Same as the Isle of White festival a month later.

7358477,5,B012UNH336,"A must have for Hendrix fans. I can't agree about it being the best . The Isle of Wight festival seems recorded better -audio and video so I recommend it first. A band of gypsies New Years concert is the best jam but bad audio/video qualty. Jimmi plays Berkeley has the earlier feel of small Venue the whole behind the back, playing with the teeth  and some cool 60's backtound stuff.
That being said this is still a great video and the whole story of how it happend is interesting.
I almost forgot .I'd buy the jimmi at Monterey pop before this also.

But as a guitar player myself I know how much work it takes to make it look so easy. Anyway  I highly recommend this dvd.",1466640000,,376,4.0

7358501,5,B012UNH336,"Amazing show, one of the best Hendrix films out there. The sound and video are excellent, fairly interesting documentary precedes the concert footage. The band is super tight, with Jimi really on top of his game here, pulling off lots of cool tricks and embellishments and sliding in some very sly riffs into old favourites. Spanish Castle Magic is absolutely stunning, as are his solos in Hey Joe, and there are some rarer numbers like Freedom and Straight Ahead. One thing I noticed is that Hendrix seemed a bit less than his usual jovial self- maybe the tuning problems caused by the extreme heat were getting to him; you can notice him tuning a lot while he is playing, more than usual. Very cool shots with fireworks going off behind him- really great stuff here all around and any fan will love it. Mitch and Billy are great- particularly Mitchell who is just on fire this show. Great mix by Eddie Kramer too.",1464480000,2,915,4.619631901840491

7358510,5,B012UNH336,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this DVD.  I was worried that there would be a lot of ""filler"" (i.e. overlong segments with people carrying on about how ""great"" Jimi was) but it's kept to a minimum.  The video of the concert is great (for 1970) and it's essential viewing for Hendrix fans.  I'll be watching this DVD again and again..it's that good.",1460678400,,354,4.587301587301587
7358511,5,B012UNH336,I was at Byron for Jimi's performance.  This video is an accurate portrayal of the event.  My only regret is that I remember the entire thing.  Probably could have had more fun...,1457827200,,179,4.53125

7358517,5,B012UNH336,"Hendrix definitely did not just phone it in for this show; there are moments that will literally take your breath away. And when I say literally, I say it knowing full well the definition.
Great long-hidden documentary on one of the last big festivals. Jimi focuses less on the showmanship and more on playing some incredibly inventive licks. My favorite live Hendrix, and I'm wicked old.",1455408000,5,388,4.893939393939394

7358519,5,B012UNH336,"Nice documentary about Jimi's performance at the Atlanta pop festival,and all the preperation that went into having one of his last Great festival appearances before his untimely death. Besides the documentary,it has plenty of footage of his performance,including the Star Spangled Banner (while fireworks go off in the background),and great renditions of many of his hits (Hey Joe,Purple haze,Stone free,etc..) and is presented in the best quality Ive seen of this footage so far.

7358524,3,B012UNH336,"Two of the best songs from this show were omitted. What is presented here is no different in substance from the bootlegged Alan Douglas version that has been out there for over 20 years. The editing of the footage became slightly irritating to me as the concert went along, as there were many extended periods when the music and picture were not synced.
To me this was not one of Jimi's better shows, which perplexes me because less than two days later was maybe the most productive day he ever had in his new studio.",1454112000,5,517,4.4526315789473685

I was at this show, lost consciousness before the end of the set, woke up the next day having slept on someone's gravesite, or maybe it was a septic tank cover.

7358531,5,B012UNH336,The best Hendrix footage I have ever seen. Finally  A photographer did the right thing and shot Jimi's hands at work. It makes you feel as if you were standing right there with him and you also get a feeling for what he was really like.  I highly highly recommend this film,1452816000,3,273,4.230769230769231
7358532,3,B012UNH336,"I love Jimi, and had the pleasure to meet him a long time ago.  By 1970, Jimi had finally mainstreamed and he wasn't the curiosity that he was in the US three years before, unless he hadn't played in your town yet.  So that's pretty much what this is.  A rote recital of his setlist with a few songs he'd been working on at Electric Lady.  He began the year with the Band Of Gypsys, and within that format he played with incredible freedom, with mostly new songs that he wanted to play.  This struck me as just another gig, and a badly lit one at that.  It's okay, but if I were to explain Hendrix to my 10-year old nephew, this wouldn't be an example I'd show him.  Not bad, but not for everyone.",1452729600,7,697,4.118518518518519
7358533,5,B012UNH336,"This is an authentic, genuine Jimi Hendrix recording from the Atlanta Music Festival, July 4, 1970 two months before Jimi's untimely death.  This is Jimi at his best with Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox. There are some interviews before and afterwards which are informative and very interesting particularly if you are interested in the music scene of the time (remember, Woodstock was the year before in 1969). Also includes some contemporary interviews with the likes of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi. A must have fro any fan of Jimi Hendrix or music of that era.",1452384000,5,564,4.936842105263158
7358534,5,B012UNH336,Hopefully the folks at Experience Hendrix decide to continue the trend they're on and release something the public hasn't seen at least once a year for some time to come. Earlier this year saw the CD release of this show from Atlanta and now finally the DVD/blu-ray has come forward. The sound of these releases is nothing short of amazing... add to that some of the best footage of Hendrix playing I've personally ever seen.

7358536,5,B012UNH336,"I was thrilled to receive this dvd.  There were performances that I had never seen before which was amazing to me. This festival took place in Byron, Georgia about 100 miles south of Atlanta on July 4. 1970.  Jimi was just amazing.  The camera work and lighting were criticized.  The little town did not generate enough electricity so Jimi could hardly see the audience which was important to him.  I loved the people of this town.  The sheriff was so intelligent in the way that he handled things which was to leave everybody alone.  The jail was so cute -- 2 cells and it looked like a museum piece.  I found the lack of electricity to be a plus because Jimi was lit so well.  I loved the camera work -- it concentrated on his face and hands and captured such an amazing experience.  I could feel Jimi's energy and the intensity of his work.  There are no gimicks to Jimi.  It is all heart and soul and who could not appreciate that.  He gave it everything that he had.  His performance of Red House was amazing, as was ""Hey Joe,"" (the song that got me interested in Jimi) ""I live today,"" ""Vodochile,"" was amazing and I want to add that ""All Along the Watchtower,"" was like riding on a speeding train.  Every song that he performed was so intense and beautiful.  How sad to know that he had only about two months left to live.  I have to mention that Jimi's philosophy was ""peace, love and happiness.""  I have never heard of any violence associated with one of Jimi's festivals.  He was an Angel and always will be.",1450396800,37,1517,4.372759856630824
7358537,4,B012UNH336,"Question: Are the DVD and blu-ray versions the same. The only thing that disappoints me about this is that it has interviews included by people that had nothing to do with the festival or Jimi himself but may have been influenced by him but are making music that is nowhere near what he was trying to convey. Kirk Hammet, really? Great guitarist but not included in genre.",1449532800,3,372,4.567164179104478

7358541,5,B012UNH336,"If you saw the special on TV, you'll want this even more since it has Freedom and Red House on it (the TV show did not). Jimi seems to be having a good time and watching fireworks go off while he's playing is fantastic.  It also makes him appear more human as he starts 'Watchtower' in the wrong key (but quickly corrects), doesn't have the words to 'Freedom' quite down yet as it was a new song at that time.  If you's a jImi Hendrix fan this is a must to own.  If you don't know who he was, but want to see a master musician get thi svideo you will not be dsiappointed.  The video quality goes from decent to great to ok. Given the age of it and the circumstances, it's understandable.  The sound is great and the backgound 'story' is good too.",1448496000,2,746,4.117241379310345

At last we have one, and I could not be happier with the results.  The picture quality blows the bootleg away.  So much so, I threw the bootleg in the trash.  The sound is equally fantastic and it now feels like you are on stage with Jimi, Billy, and Mitch.  This was a really good performance, and it is yet one more reminder of how exceptional Jimi Hendrix was.  Not just as a guitar player, but as a songwriter as well.  You can see Jimi was having a good time most of the show, although as usual there are a few times you can see he was frustrated with either the sound or his equipment, but this seems to be a fairly common situation throughout his career.  Jimi was a perfectionist in the studio and would typically do many takes before being satisfied.  He brought that same focus on stage as well and the technology in those days rarely met his exact standards.

The only special feature is a video for the song Room Full Of Mirrors which uses all the available footage of that particular song, which apparently was very little, but they did managed to make an enjoyable video non the less.  One needs to understand that the filming of this performance was set up at the last minute and film cameras could only hold so many minutes on a single reel, and although they had several cameras only so much of this show was actually captured on film.  In the parts where they missed some of the performance the editors have done a good job filling the space with shots of the crowd and the two other gentleman on stage, so the film blends these moments seamlessly.  The sound and picture are also very well matched up and Jimi's fret work is spot on for the majority of this film.  I feel the Hendrix family really hit this one out of the park.  I own all the Hendrix Blu-Ray's that have been released so far, and this one is my favorite.  I'm still hopeful that we will eventually see the Albert Hall footage one day, but until then I will be enjoying this release.  If you are a fan of Jimi's music then I highly recommend you add this Blu-Ray to your collection.",1447718400,43,2208,4.309927360774818

Clear & without a ton of junk in between this film which has sat for many years has finally come to fruition & you can get the CD separate. The interviews that are on this are worth hearing as some are from Billy & Mitch & those that put the concert on. The set shows Jimi in great form even when he makes a mistake by starting All Along the Watchtower in the wrong Key,he just lets it ride on by & switches to the correct Key & rips the daylights out of it . Even Jimi stated he was prone to forget lyrics but it never mattered to him or us. For Hendrix fans this DVD is well worth having as i said the camera work is super good as is the sound. Not in my opinion only as good as Jimi Plays Berkeley but certainly one of the best Hendrix films out there.  Not a DVD to be passed by.",1504483200,,866,3.8379888268156424
