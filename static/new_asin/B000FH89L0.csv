2565410,1,B000FH89L0,"Fanfan la Tulipe may be a favorite with the French but frankly I find it tolerable only if one views it as a spoof of swashbucklers. This film is not worthy of inclusion in the Criterion Collection, and it does nothing to justify Gerard Philipe's reputation as an actor.",1227398400,,270,4.530612244897959
2565411,5,B000FH89L0,"Indeed, a welcome release.  This 1951 French comedy by Christian-Jaque has been treasured by generations of moviegoers, and with good reason.  It is a perfectly realized swashbuckler filled with fine humor and Gallic dalliance, and interpreted by a wonderful cast headed by the greatest French actor of his generation, Gerard Philipe.  Shot on the Riviera in locations that do evoke 18th-century France, FANFAN LA TULIPE is a film to be savoured on a minute-to-minute basis, since its delightful attractions never seem to end.

Particular mention must be made to the fact that Gina Lollobrigida had the first great opportunity of her career in this film.  It amazes one to think that this exquisite actress had already been featured in 17 films since 1946, and practically had to leave Italy in order to become a star. This, notwithstanding the obvious potential she had shown in PAGLIACCI (1948), in which she is a a knockout as Leoncavallo's heroine, Nedda.

All in all, a film to be enjoyed many times, and for many reasons.",1224979200,13,1027,4.976608187134503
2565412,5,B000FH89L0,"I have been waiting for this DVD for many years - it is a nice way to complete one's collection of 17th & 18th century, French adventure related movies such as The Three Musketeers, The Man in the Iron Mask, The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Count of Monte Cristo, Scaramouche and Angelique to name but a few.
Because of its great action scenes, this movie did very well in the US back in the 50s when it was first released. It was even thought of as a ""French western"".
To use an analogy between the main star and a famous American star, Gerard Philipe was in many ways the French James Dean. Very popular in France, he had the misfortune of an early death (Philipe died one week short of his 37th birthday). On the other hand, Gerard Philipe's athletic performances may remind some of Johnny Weissmuller rather then the cool Dean ...",1221782400,8,828,4.453947368421052
2565413,5,B000FH89L0,"Fanfan la Tulipe is a wonderful story about a handsome rogue (Gerard Phillipe) who is told by a fortune teller (Gina Lollibrigida) that he will marry the daughter of the king.  He engages in one swashbuckling escapade after another in his quest for the princess.  He survives a ""hanging,"" has swordfights galore and engages in a wonderful race to save the princess from a kidnapping--as good as any race in a US western.  It is a wonderful satire about wars as fought in the time of Louis XV.  I saw this movie when it first came out in 1953 or thereabouts and has always been one of my absolute favorite movies.  But, decades passed without being able to see it, so I was delighted when it became available on DVDs, first in France and later in England.  The Russian version, the only one listed on Amazon.com is a PAL version.  I have not seen it, but the British version (also PAL) is listed on Amazon.com.uk and the cost of shipping to the US is reasonable.  One needs a DVD player which can play PAL disks, and Phillips makes one (available from Amazon.com for under $60 incl. shipping) which can easily be programmed to play PAL as well as NTSC DVDs.  (The instructions do not mention this, but various websites easily found with Google have it posted.  Open the disk tray, and while it is open, use the remote to send (i.e., press) 7 8 9 press OK and then send 0.  It will now play any DVD.)  Since there are a number of good British movies which are available only on PAL, a player which plays both NTSC and PAL disks may be useful for those interested in British films.

Gerard Phillipe, perfect in the role of Fanfan, may not be very well known to most people today, because he died not long after this movie was made.  He and Jeanne Moreau were the stars of the original ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" directed by Roger Vadim which was very successfully re-made (twice) a decade ago--as Dangerous Liaisons and as Valmont  The original (with English sub-titles) is available on VHS at Amazon.com.",1151193600,,2002,4.522222222222222
8122565,5,B000FH89L0,My 90 year old mom felt like a teenager as she was when she saw it first time. Good transfer and also dubbed to English.,1521072000,,120,3.84

8122568,3,B000FH89L0,"I ordered this because I had seen it when I was taking French at UCLA.  It was so funny then that I took my parent to see it!  They loved it.  However after rediscovering it I found it rather dated.  It is still funny, but now we have even funnier movies to compare it to.  It is not a classic, but good and a great tool for people learning French.",1383523200,,348,3.914285714285714
8122569,4,B000FH89L0,"I purchased ""Fanfan"" as a big fancier of swashbucklers, but not a foreign film buff.  I admit to an initial wariness of this French swashbuckler, but was pleasantly surprised.  The film has brio: lots of swashbuckling action, wit, and saucy romance.  If you love swashbucklers I recommend it.  The Criterion edition has a clean, bright print and the original French soundtrack, available with or without English subtitles, plus an optional dubbed English soundtrack that's not bad.",1353974400,3,481,5.2894736842105265
8122570,4,B000FH89L0,"A promiscuous peasant Fanfan (Grard Philipe) was caught in the haystack with a local girl and now must pay the ultimate price; you guessed it a forced marriage. To the rescue a fortuneteller (Gina Lollobrigida) predicts that the military will lead him to fame and glory, eventually to marry the king's daughter.

Fanfan realizing he has been flimflammed decides to make the predictions come true. Mean while the seven year war goes on as planned until fait takes its turn.

Together we watch the swashbuckling comedy. Yes production may come true but it looks more likely that Fanfan la Tulipe and his adopted father are about to swing from tree of justice. Can anybody save them?

The version I watch was criterion black and white. Once in French with English subtitles and once in English dubbed. You may find the subtitles do not exactly match the dubbed version. There is also a short history of Grard Philipe on this criterion version. And some clips from the colorized version.

I have not seen it yet but there is a 2003 version with Penlope Cruz.",1347148800,,1054,4.743169398907104
8122571,5,B000FH89L0,"Fanfan (Gerard Philipe) is a womanizer. He ecapes marrying one by subscribing to the 7 years war in 1763 or so. All his adventures are wonderful: he is told by a lady (Lollobrigida) that he will marry the daughter of the king Louis XVI; he dares to enter the king's daughter room but escapes being hung since the king has looked into the graces of Lollobrigida. When she hides at the convent of Mortelame Lebel, the valet of the king, discovers her hide-out and organizes a rescue. Fanfan understands this plot and prevents it but looses again the dame. Looked for by the soldiers of an enemy who speaks a sort of funny german, he and his 2 soldier friends win over the entire enemy force who surrender en masse to an astonished king. So Fanfan obtains by him the hand of his (adopted) daughter: Gina Lollobrigida.

My story cannot tell the great beauty of this shwashbuck movie, one of the best I ever met in my life as a moviegoer. Filmed almost 60 years ago (in 1952) the movie has not lost a single piece of shrewedness, cunning or love (never being romantic; there is never a love scene in the entire story).  I strongly recommend it to lovers of the gender.",1275177600,5,1163,4.455399061032864
8122572,4,B000FH89L0,"Fanfan la Tulipe, in its 1952 Gerard Philippe incarnation, is a highly enjoyable romp that alternates between the bawdy and the witty as it follows the adventures of its marriage-averse hero as he joins the army after Gina Lollabrigida's fake gypsy predicts he will marry the King's daughter as the seven-years Lace War rages pointlessly in the background. It's got energy to spare as it races from one action scene or comic setpiece to another, and while there's nothing particularly original on display, it's done with such enthusiasm it's hard to dislike. It's also the only film I've seen where Lollabrigida plays a genuinely likeable character, and quite charming she is too.

The UK PAL DVD comes with the original black and white version and a surprisingly good colorized version.",1241827200,,787,5.053846153846154
8122573,5,B000FH89L0,"This is a prime example of the influence Criterion asserts on film fans. Until three weeks ago I had never heard of ""Fanfan la Tulipe"" nor it's primary stars. I read the brief blurb at the Criterion site before nearly impulsively purchasing the dvd. Not surprisingly, I wasn't disappointed with either the dvd presentation or the quality of the film itself.

As I've come to expect from Criterion - the film print looks fantastic and the essay booklet is interesting and informative. The Criterion essays are always important because they not only provide a bit of background information behind the film, but also point out the lasting influence the work acheived. For instance, this essay includes an amusing quote from critic Georges Sadoul as well as a few ideas on why this film isn't as well known today despite its popularity upon release.

There are numerious distillations of the hilariously clever plot of this film, so I won't go into that. Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of period films, particularly Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn swashbucklers, you're going to have a great time with this one.

This is one Criterion film in which there simply isn't much bonus material. The brief program about lead actor Gerard Philipe is the only one of note here. The colorized clip isn't worth much, but I'm always happy for anything extra on a dvd.

Side notes: Film snobs may whine that ""popcorn"" releases such as this aren't worthy of the iconic Criterion logo, but its just this sort of celluloid elitism that Criterion is trying to dispel. No longer will the casual film buff search the world over and pay too much for a copy of films like ""Before the Rain"" or ""Mon Oncle Antoine"".

The influence, quality, and importance of a film is really all quite subjective anyway. I count ""This Sporting Life"" among the greatest character studies ever made, while you may find it a boring two hour exercise in watching a dumb brute driving the widow he lives with insane.",1228521600,9,1972,4.737609329446064
8122574,5,B000FH89L0,"Adapted from a beloved French story dating back to an 1819 song, Fanfan la Tulipe is a French swashbuckling bodice-ripper, an action-adventure film as if written by Oscar Wilde - in other words, all kinds of amusing double entrendes and bawdy language.

Fanfan la Tulipe is a fun, action-packed tale with plenty of exciting duels, beautiful women, daring escapes and rescues, and pompous bad guys - everything you'd come to expect from a rip-roaring adventure the likes of which they just don't make anymore. Largely unknown in North America, this snazzy DVD edition from the folks at the Criterion Collection will hopefully introduce this charming, irrepressible film to a brand new audience.

""Gerard Philipe: Star, Idol, Legend"" takes a look at the actor's career with new interviews from Philipe's daughter Anne-Marie and his biographer, Gerard Bonal. Philipe made Fanfan la Tulipe at the height of his career. Along with vintage family photographs, Anne-Marie and Bonal document the man's early life and how he got into acting. This is an excellent look at the actor.

""Clip from Colorized Fanfan la Tulipe"" features an excerpt from the 1997 colorized version of the film which gives it a vibrant look but still doesn't surpass the black and white original.

Finally, there is a trailer.",1228435200,3,1292,5.109004739336493
