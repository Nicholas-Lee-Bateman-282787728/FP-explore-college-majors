1668670,5,B00005UW89,This is very much a well done Hallmark movie that takes place during one of the World War's.  The love story is kept clean and the background is so authentically done that one really feels like it is taking place in Italy.  Hallmark knows how to make a pleasant movie that has light action in it.  And this is one of their best.,1200700800,12,328,4.174603174603175
1668671,5,B00005UW89,"This is a wonderful movie with no blood, gore or sex, but enough realism to give you glimpse of a (war)time and place and what war does to people (ie, ratting on their neighbors, et al). Barora Bobulova is a very good actress. She and Callum Blue are great together. I will watch this movie again and again and never tire of it. It reminds me of the 40's movie, ""Random Harvest"" with Greer Garson and Ronald Colman - a true war movie classic.",1190332800,6,442,4.273809523809524
1668672,5,B00005UW89,"This is one of my most favorite movies ever!  I brings to life a simple romance in the midst of war.  The actors are really good, and story line is clean.  I would recomend for anyone of any age.  I remember when I was 6 or 7 and my parents were watching it and I remember little bits of it.  Then about a month ago I saw it at the library and instantly recognized it, even though I hadn't seen the cover for almost a decade.  I also have a fine on it at the library for having it too long...",1178496000,5,492,3.8217821782178216
1668673,5,B00005UW89,I think this is one of the most adorable movies I have ever seen. I think as far as made for tv movies go this one is excellent! The actors were all great! Also what makes it such a good movie is that is a true story.,1085529600,10,217,3.6382978723404253
1668674,5,B00005UW89,"This movie, in my opinion, was better than Pearl Harbor. I loved it!  The ending is just.... so perfect, you'll cry. I can't say enough how much I loved this movie.  If you liked Pearl Harbor (and even if you didn't!), you can't go wrong with this one!",1017964800,18,252,4.229166666666667
1668675,5,B00005UW89,"A miraculous true story of courage, determination and love in war-torn Italy.
While leading an ill-fated commando raid behind enemy lines during World War II, British lieutenant Eric Newby (Callum Blue) is captured and imprisoned. As Italy's fascist government collapses, the prisoners escape just ahead of the advancing German troops. When an injury leaves Eric stranded and on his own, a chance meeting with a young Italian woman, Wanda (Barbara Bobulova), saves his life.
Wanda and her family help Eric to hide, and she secretly teaches him Italian to conceal his identity and avoid recapture. As the two spend more time together, Eric discovers his feelings for Wanda have grown far beyond gratitude. This newly found love is shared by his beautiful rescuer.
Every day, however, the Germans seem closer to finding him. Wanda and her friends face increasing risks to find new ways to keep him safe. When fascist sympathizers lead the Nazis directly to Eric, he faces an agonizing choice. If he tries to escape, Wanda and all the people who have helped him will likely be killed. If he surrenders and is sent to a POW camp, he will probably never see Wanda again. Fate brought them together, but now one decision could separate them forever...",1017446400,18,1245,4.961722488038277
1668686,4,B00005UW89,Enjoyable movie and especially if you've read Eric Newby's books.,1422403200,,65,5.6
1668687,5,B00005UW89,I am very happy with the product and quick delivery.  Thank you.,1417132800,,64,4.333333333333333
1668688,4,B00005UW89,"I just read the book by Eric Newby on which they based this film: ""Love and War in the Apennines."" The book was incredible and I couldn't put it down. The movie is good, it's by Hallmark so you know it will be family entertainment. It borders on but never crosses over into sappy. But it would have been much better if they had added some depth; it's pretty lightweight. And they did change the story a little--but not enough to ruin it. It's a good film so if you liked the book, you will like the movie--although I wish it had been longer and that it had included more events from Eric's life as a POW in Italy. Callum Blue is good but a little taken with himself: it seems like he is the type to look closely into every mirror he passes. Barbora Bobulova is excellent and very pretty.",1401753600,,787,4.218543046357616
1668689,5,B00005UW89,I look forward to watching this movie. I loved the other movies in this group. I received it on time and packing was great. Thank you.,1392249600,,134,4.1923076923076925
1668690,5,B00005UW89,When my sister opened it up this morning I learned that this is one of her favorites. She enjoyed watching it on T. V. and now she can watch it anytime.,1387929600,,152,3.935483870967742
1668691,3,B00005UW89,"I liked everything in this movie besides the story line which was weak and had a terrible ending. The actors were good, though a little corny and the camera work was well done. It looked professionally done, but I was just not satisfied with the story. It somehow left something wanting.",1386633600,2,287,4.647058823529412
1668692,4,B00005UW89,"This movie, though set in Italy during the second world war, was touching at times, and at times, quite humorous.  Based on a true story, Hallmark manages to draw us into the lives of one soldier and his attempt to avoid capture, and those who put themselves at risk to hide and protect him.  There's a love story in the midst of the hardship that encourages us to cheer the soldier on.  I would recommend this to others who enjoy well-written and well-acted movies based on true stories.",1376352000,3,488,4.5227272727272725
1668693,5,B00005UW89,"We very much enjoyed this movie! A choice of events of WW II are the stage for this documentary about a young British soldier, who was captivated and transported to Italy during the war, and the family who protects him from the Germans for as long as they possibly can. The communist Italians start a man hunt. The people willing to hide him in their houses are a heart warming confirmation that the people were not enemies, their governments were. The events making this story so remarkable are tumbling quickly from one scene to another, never boring and educational at the same time. The eventually happy ending brings tears of joy to your eyes for sensitive characters such as me. We've watched it so many times, this is our replacement copy, since we wore the first one out!",1374451200,3,779,4.6521739130434785
1668694,5,B00005UW89,"This is a great story about Italy in WWII.  It is based on a true story and when they made the picture, I think the actual couple celebrated their 60-something wedding anniversary.  There are great pictures of the Tuscany area or an area very much like Tuscany and the Marsh (sp?) hill country.  We just came back from Tuscany, and the friendliness and hospitality of the people are true in the picture.  It's a great movie of Italian WWII History without all the machine guns!",1373587200,3,477,4.576470588235294
1668695,5,B00005UW89,"I had to buy this dvd so that I could watch it again and again.  This is a very moving story of love, daring and courage during wwll.  It is often suspenseful, but also hopeful. One can't help but be touched by the good that does endure and overcome the awful circumstances of war.",1371427200,,281,4.185185185185185
1668696,5,B00005UW89,Ordered for my husband's birthday to replace the VHS version.  We love Eric Newby's book and this video is great.,1363910400,,113,4.65
1668697,5,B00005UW89,This was a classic Hallmark movie.  A real Italian movie made entirely in Italy.  A great story and well done.  I would recommend this movie.,1347062400,,141,4.56
1668698,4,B00005UW89,"I enjoy most films that deal with the war. Great romance film of how Italians in a small villiage protected a British solider from the Germans. Nice, clean, inspiring film.",1322352000,,172,4.766666666666667
1668699,5,B00005UW89,"In Love and War is a true story about two young people who meet during WW II and fall in love.  He was a prisoner of war, and she was a beautiful Italian girl.  It is a heart warming story that shows there were good people among ""the enemies"".  It is well worth your money and time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Love-and-War/dp/B00005UW89/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Love and War</a>",1290384000,,428,5.761904761904762
1668700,5,B00005UW89,"In Love and War is an adoreable WWII love story about a young British soldier and an Italian woman.

The only thing that I think is really important to point out about this film is the fact that there is a lot of dialogue in both Italian and German, and though subtitles are provided for the German, there aren't any for the Italian. Now, for scholars of Italian and other romance languages, it's not much of a problem, but anyone else would eb a little lost - at first it seems to be part of the atmosphere, as the British soldier is in Italy and cannot understand the language, so it's like you're seeing it through his eyes, but as the story progresses, there continues to be the bits in Italian with no translation.",1270080000,5,719,4.365671641791045
1668701,5,B00005UW89,"This story about WWII in Italy was so interesting that I bought the book on which it was based (Love and Way in the Apennines) and a subsequent book (A Little Place in Italy), both written by the main character in this movie, Eric Newby.",1268870400,,237,4.288888888888889
1668702,5,B00005UW89,"The first time I saw this movie on Hallmark I thought it was a great love story. When it was released on DVD I had to have it (my wife likes love stories). After my second veiwing I noticed more drama and action than before (which I like). The third veiwing I noticed great comedy. ' In Love and War', which is based on actual events, has all these attributes and more. I have often felt that stories based on actual events make the best movies. 'In Love and War' is proof of this. As said earlier this movie has drama, action, comedy, and a true love story. It can be veiwed by the entire family may be veiwed again and again and continue to please. I give this movie high marks!",1264982400,2,680,4.159090909090909
1668703,3,B00005UW89,"A British commando unit is captured on an Italian beach and sent
to an orphanage-mansion converted to a prisoner of war camp.
When Italy leaves the war the prison commander sets the English prisoners free.
The young officer Eric Newby has broken his leg telling everyone
the Germans were down the road.
The rest of the prisoners escape north toward Switzerland
leaving him behind ( only to be recaptured by the Germans).
He is taken to a convent hospital
where the doctor's young nurse volunteers to teach him Italian.
They fall in love and the rest of the movie is about him,
ansd it seems like half of Itality is trying to help him
and the other half to turn him  in.
It is a nice heart warming love story about a rural community
in Italy during WWII.",1257638400,3,753,4.456521739130435
1668704,5,B00005UW89,"I originally bought this dvd for my daughter's birthday, and we have found it to be one of our favorite movies.  It's a really sweet love story - clean, romantic, funny - and based on a true story, which makes it even better.  The part when the prisoners of war had to go on a ""forced march"" through the country-side always brings a giggle!  And the end, if predictable, is very satisfying!",1251849600,,390,4.388888888888889
1668705,5,B00005UW89,Great movie. Good plot; costuming very much in keeping with the era. Takes you back in time. Great for those interested in World war II events.,1245024000,,143,4.538461538461538

7955471,3,B00005UW89,"Story line was easy to follow, it didn't jump all over the place. Was not the movie I thought it was. I thought it was an earlier version of In Love and War starring Chris O'Donnell & Sandra Bullock, which was about Ernest Hemmingway. This movie was about a POW, which Hemmingway was not, and a french woman and how they fell in love. Good story line. Easy to follow. It's not a movie I desire to watch over and over, again, but it was a good movie.",1475971200,2,449,4.113636363636363
7955472,4,B00005UW89,"I know why the movie was under 20 bucks.

It was a good movie but most of it was done in the Italian language. There is some English language.  If you do not speak Italian you can turn on the captions for the hearing impaired. If you like true stories you will like this one. Well you will have to buy it I am not about to spoil the mystery.

Over all I have rated In Love and War four stars for action and mystery. Some recommendations I have is DO NOT watch when you are too tired to think. This movie is not a veg out and turn off your brain kind of movie. This video has a happy ending but if you need a pick me up after a stressful day you should watch You've Got Mail or something along that line. You ask my mother and she will recommend it for you ladies or any one that likes romance.",1473292800,2,793,3.882716049382716
7955473,5,B00005UW89,I loved seeing it again!  I saw it years ago when it first was shown on television.  The cast was perfect and the story sweet and sentimental.  I loved every minute!!,1471910400,,166,4.290322580645161

7955475,3,B00005UW89,"I have read most of Eric Newby's books (some such as THE LAST GRAIN RACE several times) and find that he was a particularly fine writer whose characters are well fleshed out and engaging.  He writes, also, with considerable charm, humor and understanding of the human condition and the places that he's visiting.

I loved LOVE AND WAR IN THE APPENINES from which this movie was made.  Unfortunately his is a sad shadow of his interesting book and there were times when it was so saccharine that I almost had to gag.  Also, the various characters are almost stereotypes and as such not believable.  Alas, I won't be watching this movie again.",1468540800,,641,4.6875
7955476,5,B00005UW89,"I wanted this on DVD (already had it on video) as this is one of my favorite Hall of Fame movies. I love that it is based on a true story and has all the requirements of a quality production--action, humor and romance--as well as a beautiful setting. The scene with the young soldier eating with the Italian family sheltering him is priceless!",1464220800,2,343,4.4603174603174605
