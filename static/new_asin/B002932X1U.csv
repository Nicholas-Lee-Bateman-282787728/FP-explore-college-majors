8357411,4,B002932X1U,"Somehow, I missed this movie upon its original theatrical release and I've always wanted to see it. I finally broke down and ordered this made on demand version. The film itself is not bad. It's an above average B-grade 70s action flick. It was released by American International Pictures, and that fact alone should tell you all you need to know. The MOD disc itself does leave a lot to be desired. There is a LOT of grain in the picture, and I'd bet it's not all inherent in the original film negative. I find it hard to believe that MGM could not find a better print to work from. Like most MGM MOD releases, it's nice to finally be able to see the film, but the price is not really justified due to the lack of quality in the product you receive.",1487808000,,750,4.251748251748252

8357413,4,B002932X1U,"This is an entertaining action film. Baker doesn't know karate. He just punches and throws his opponents through windows. It works for me. Kelly appears about half way through the movie and beats up a few henchmen. The scene in the middle of the film where Baker, Kelly and everyone is fighting should've been longer. However, there is plenty of action and broken glass to appease action fans. Baker does a good job. I wish Kelly had more scenes. Recommended for Baker and Kelly fans.",1461024000,,484,4.705882352941177
8357414,3,B002932X1U,"Good old school crossover,  but Joe Don Baker is terribly miscast in this... I wonder if George Lazenby was supposed to play the lead here, along with Bruce Lee...",1440547200,,163,4.620689655172414
8357415,3,B002932X1U,"You find out early on that the plot revolves around a golden statue with acupuncture pins placed in it where if placed on a man, results in enhanced virility and rejuvenation. I wanted to like it more, but I thought Joe Don Baker was bad casting for this part. It moves along well, and there are some interesting characters, but the plot and script could have been better developed. Elizabeth Ashley was good, but I didn't feel the chemistry between her and Baker.
The main bad guys were pretty good. There were a few loose end in the plot. The use of the Golden Needles could have been played up better. . Baker's buddy from the States was not developed much. There appears that there may have been some cuts for censors or hasty editing. Perhaps because they were filming in Hong Kong.
Altogether OK, for an exotic actioner with some humor.",1420416000,,842,4.546052631578948
8357416,4,B002932X1U,Need I say more? Stunning and talented in equal measure. Joe Don Baker and Burgess Meredith add to the fun -- something about the hunt for a golden statue. A very enjoyable movie.,1416614400,,179,4.454545454545454
