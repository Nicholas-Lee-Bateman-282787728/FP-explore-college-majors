7800583,5,1629972975,"This review is about Robert Greenberg's need to reshoot his lecture on Wagners Ring cycle  and to explain why the remake may be necessary to the reputation of The Teaching Company and to Greenberg himself.

Greenberg begins the lecture in question by saying that he has received criticisms for similar statements, perhaps from the mini-series he did on Wagners life and music.  He then doubles down on the material in question, a device that is reprehensible in any public statement in any medium.  On that fact alone TTC and Greenberg should realize the need for a revision, but there are more reasons to support this request:

1) This lecture is unlike any other lecture in the series and does not follow the promised format.  The other lectures are excellent.

2) Greenberg presents his interpretation as the only and proper way to interpret the Ring cycle, when, in fact, interpreting the Ring became a virtual industry almost from the time the four operas were presented together in an appropriately short period of time in the late 1870s.

3) There are other respectable interpretations of Wagners intentions, most importantly George Bernard Shaws book, The Perfect Wagnerite, which appeared first in print in 1898, had four editions, 1922 being the last, and is still in print today.  Please remember that Shaw was and is a respected dramatist (important to this because Wagner certainly was a concerned dramatist) and music critic (not a reviewer, but a critic, a profound difference).  One does not have to agree with Shaws meticulously detailed and nuanced interpretation, but one must attend to his methodology:  Shaw examined Wagners political and other tracts from the period during which he was working on the librettos that became the four operas of the Ring, and wrote his analysis of the Ring in view of the Wagner of those years, 1848 to 1860.  After the Paris Commune of 1871, Wagners politics changed.  Greenberg makes no mention of Shaw or his methodology  has he read Shaw?  If so, does he dismiss the importance of Shaws methodology?

A bit of information about Wagners life during the period in question, 1848 to 1860:  In 1848 there was an uprising in Dresden (elsewhere, as well, but the concern here is only with Dresden).  There were three ringleaders in this oppressed-people-against-the-government affair; two of the ringleaders were captured and put in jail; the third escaped to Switzerland.  That third man was Richard Wagner., who continued to write in support of what (according to Shaws reading of Wagners pamphlets, letters, etc. of the period) he saw at that time to be the people agains the government.

4) When analyzing the Ring, it is important to note the order in which the librettos were written:  Wagner did not set out to write four operas or a cycle of operas.  His original intention was to write an opera about the death of Siegfried  thats all.  One opera.  When he finished that opera, which became number four in the cycle, he saw the need for some backstory to explain how Siegfried and Brunhilde wound up on that mountain, so he wrote Siegfried, which became number three in the cycle.  (To make sure that Im clear on this, the opera Wagner wrote second became number three.)  Once again Wagner saw the need for more backstory so he wrote Die Walkure to explain how Brunhilde wound up on the mountain and how Siegfried happened to be raised from birth by a Nebelung.  At that point there was a need to explain the importance of the gold ring, ergo the Prologue, Das Rheingold.  In other words, the librettos of the Ring Cycle were written in reverse chronological order, making it highly unlikely that Wagner set out with any well-thought out plan, let alone the one that Greenberg proposes.

Greenbergs Ring Cycle lecture is therefore academically irresponsible.  In addition, as per his first lecture in this series, he was to have given the historical events that evoked this music.  If he chose not to do that, he could have given a lecture on the most unusual aspect of the cycle, the leitmotivs.  He had excellent material from which to choose; his decision to double-down on an unlikely analysis is very disappointing; very bad policy.",1485648000,3,4197,4.882768361581921
