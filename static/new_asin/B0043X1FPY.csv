8415441,5,B0043X1FPY,Very good. Dvd ran great. No problems. No damage noted.,1503532800,,55,4.6
8415442,4,B0043X1FPY,"Fleet wood Mac (spell check) in their prime! Great DVD.... Wo! wrote that on a purchase years before, and it was a great DVD. (my collection was stolen) so when this came up again, tho much more expensive I jumped at the chance to buy it! But this is a poor copy from VHS when the camera backs off you can't even tell who's on stage by sight. Really Poor. But I'm glad to have a copy again even at a huge price jump and poor quality. The one I first purchased was very good quality, this one not. Im appreciative to have it again tho.",1472947200,,534,4.047169811320755

8415444,2,B0043X1FPY,The Recording is not high definition and sounds muffled and the visual is muffled. The stereo is not that good. There is a slight hiss in the recording. This 1982 recording was originally out on VHS and the sound and visual were originally excellent. I bought it so that I could have a digital version of my original VHS so that I could watch it more easily. I wish I hadn't bought this one as it seems to be a fake.,1427414400,8,416,4.148148148148148

8415446,5,B0043X1FPY,"I love this dvd! I'm a huge Fleetwood Mac fan as well as a huge fan of Christine McVie's, Lindsey Buckingham's and Stevie Nicks' solo work. Mick Fleetwood's and John McVie's drums and bass rhythms are the perfect backdrop for the 3 singer/songwriter band members who also play musical instruments of their own up front: Christine McVie: keyboards, Lindsey Buckingham: guitar and Stevie Nicks:  the tambourine. They're [Fleetwood Mac] at their absolute best in this dvd concert! Their mix of diverse talents (and multitalents) all make s fantastic mix as a band! Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie all have easily recognizable unique and distinct vocals to the point that both combined and solo one can easily recognize each of them solo immediately from any and every other vocalist including themselves! Fleetwood Mac are one of the most extraordinary bands of all time and they have and always will be an important ingredient in the history book of the best rock and roller bands of all time! :) I can say in truth that this dvd is one of my many Fleetwood Mac concert dvds that I love so much and always will and will never, ever become tired of viewing for the rest of my life to the point that it might get so worn out that I'll likely have to replace it with a new copy at some point..........",1397606400,4,1317,4.676724137931035
8415447,2,B0043X1FPY,"Again, this is recorded by someone holding a camera on their TV while this concert is running. Really dumb. I have the VHS and could have captured it digitally myself doing this way. Very disappointing.",1301529600,20,202,4.8
