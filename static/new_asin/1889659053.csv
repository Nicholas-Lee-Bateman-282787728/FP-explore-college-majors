7800986,5,1889659053,Sifu Shou-Yu Liang is the Tai Chi Master to learn from. Make it down to Vancouver and meet the man and learn from the Legendary Master of Tai Chi and Gong-Fu.,1520294400,,158,4.129032258064516
7800987,5,1889659053,"I have 4 videos of Taichi sword and I highly recommend this in addition to Paul Lam's Tai Chi The 32 forms.

What differentiates this from the others is the didactic way chosen by Mr Shou Yu Liang to repeat each form 4 times showing exactly the transition movements between each form, letting the novice to follow and replicate the steps easily. And it is very comfortable to not need to rewind the tape so frequently.

 For intermediate and advanced levels I would recommend the DVD Classical Yang Style by Jwing Ming Yang. This comprehensive video goes further because it contains 54 postures , sword techniques and aplications, and most valuable of all, a Taiji Sword Qigong set.

 So buy these tree if you are really interested in learning this sophisticated routine of the Tai Chi system. Even if you have an instructor they will be the perfect complement.",1137542400,4,861,4.751677852348993
7800988,5,1889659053,"Master Shou-Yu Liang does an outstanding job of showing the Tai Chi Sword form in 4 sections with 6 to 8 parts in each.  He shows the front and back view as well as repeating each part 4 times.  This method is good if you are following video as you learn.  This way you will be able to repeat each part 4 times with the video.  I especially like the background music (soft classical paino), stage setting and lighting with Tai Chi uniforms.  You can see full body moves which helps when trying to understand the stance and arm and leg positioning.  I would recommend this video to anyone interested in learn the Tai Chi Sword form.",1036627200,24,631,4.35042735042735
7800989,5,1889659053,"This video is really good. It covers the standard 32 postures serie. I fully agree with the previous other reviewers. In addition to more highlight the video, I'd like to say that each movement is repeated 4 times but not just ""copy-paste"" the same sequence, it is really performed 4 different times so that you can notice small differences in different part of the movement that help you to better understand the movement itself. What I also really appreciate is the fact the movements are shown in both front and back view. This is great since the back view puts you in the same condition as in a class (back to the teacher) without haveing the mirror problem. The only point is that I'd have appreciated some application of the movement.
In conclusion the video really puts you as in a class. The only limitation is that it can not correct you........",999820800,20,854,4.625
7800990,5,1889659053,"I spontaneously enrolled in a Tai Chi Sword class excitedly waiting for the first instruction and when it came it was in Chinese ... ""oops"".  It was too beautiful to pass up so I stayed.  I frantically looked for instruction, written or otherwise, and when I gambled on this video I was blessed.  I was able to keep up with the class because the video was very similar to my instructors' 32 steps except for one additional move.  Although I prefer my instructors' style and grace because she looked like she was floating on air, this video helped me complete the course with confidence and most of all - joy.",996710400,13,608,4.5
7800991,5,1889659053,"Found the quality of the video and sound good.  Lighting was good and  camera angles excellent so that precise motions could be easily followed.  I liked the presentation of the lessons.  There is plenty of repitition of  each segment of each form.  One doesn't need to keep rewinding the tape to  catch something missed.  Doesn't get bogged down in detailed explanations,  but lets the action of demonstation speak to us.  There are front and back  views and each part is demonstrated at least four times before connecting  with the other segments.  I really like it and find it extremely helpful as  a great supplement to actual instruction.  In a pinch I could use it for  primary instruction if necessary.",965520000,31,709,4.831932773109243
