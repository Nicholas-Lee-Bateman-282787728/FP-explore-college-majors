2769163,5,B000NIVPA8,"I just returned from the Palm Beach premier of ""Rain.""  Being a HUGE V.C. Andrews fan I came into the event feeling both extremely excited, but also fearful...fearful of the film being dissapointing.  This film came out of no where and caught the ENTIRE audience off guard.  It is rare that I shed tears while at a movie theatre, but the execution of this film compared to the novel it is based on was both spectacular and touching.  As I looked around, I saw everyone else in the theatre was teary eyed at the exact same scene, so I didn't feel quite as bad.

I am huge on coming of age stories, and this tops off that genre as being one of the best I've seen.  I hope they make the soundtrack available for purchase!",1178668800,5,718,4.281481481481482

2769190,1,B000NIVPA8,"Anything that can be said about how horrible this film is has been stated already. It's just bad plot acting (with the exception of rains adoptive parents and Dunaway). I'm so glad that I didn't expect this to be good and had it on while i was doing other stuff, but I guess I thought it would be a little better. Also, how in the hell did her mother get buried and no one told her until afterwards. Yeah, cause that makes sense.",1391299200,,429,4.180722891566265

2769193,5,B000NIVPA8,"I love this movie.  Rain is the daughter every mother hopes for:  talented, intelligent, sweet, kindhearted, considerate and has excellent manners.  She is also a very beautiful young lady.  This is a touching story with great music.  Donna Summers' daughter, Brooklyn Sudano, is excellent as Rain Arnold, the young girl who overhears a conversation which will change her life forever.  Tragedy leads to her having to leave her D.C. ghetto home for the wealthier world of the Hudsons.  It's not easy yet Rain has what it takes to fit in very well.  Faye Dunaway is exceptional as Mrs. Hudson.  She's a tough woman who does have a heart that can be touched and who better to get to her heart than Rain who is a very special young lady.  It's a pity they haven't made movies continuing this great, touching story.  This movie is so good that I bought two more copies to give to people close to me for presents.  They loved it as much as I do.  My mother and I watch this movie at least once a week and we never get tired of it.  The bad guy is really good.  He can be rather amusing at times.  He scares me from the TV screen he's so good at being bad.  It's a good movie at a good price.",1376438400,3,1186,4.27027027027027
2769194,5,B000NIVPA8,"I did not have the disadvantage of having first read the book, and I loved this film.
The actors' heartbreaking experiences were real, and I was surprised to find myself emotionally devastated. Fay Duniway gives the performance of her career. A beautiful model of a negro girl may not be expected to act, but her role fit Booklyn Sudano like a glove, and she was inspired by it. But in many respects the restrained performance of her dignified and adoptive mother Khandi Alexander was the best of show. The story revolves around these three women who can not be beaten down.
Underlying the action is an original musical score, often featuring beautiful solos in the cello and guitar. A tour de force for David Baron. The script is terse, leaving plenty of room for the movie elements to shine through.

2769195,5,B000NIVPA8,the only way you could get the prequel was to buy the dvd. but they never had the dvd in stores. if you are a v.c. andrews fan its a must have!!!,1353801600,3,145,3.5625
2769196,5,B000NIVPA8,I saw this on Netflix and loved it so much that I got the DVD. Great story. You can learn about yourself from the must unexpected situations and people.,1353715200,,152,4.275862068965517

2769198,3,B000NIVPA8,"I ran across this when I was looking for something to watch on Netflix. I read the book when I was in middle school and I liked it so I figured I'd watch it. I thought even if it wasn't good, I could laugh at it. While there were some kind of corny laughable moments (the first 30 minutes of the movie in the hood), there were a lot of good moments also. It was obviously a little low budget but if you take it for what it is, it's a decent movie. I only wish they included some important things they left out from the book.",1341619200,,524,3.9065420560747666
2769199,5,B000NIVPA8,"I truly enjoyed the movie it shows that no matter a dirty little secret always have a way of coming out I really enjoyed that fact that no matter what Rain didn't let anyone rain on her parade including her grandmother it's a shame that she didn't get to know her own father also I loved it in the movie that Rain told her aunt it was a pleasure meeting you right then and there her grandmother knew that even though she was raised in the hood she was not ghetto fabulous,Also she knew that she was already a refined young lady who had poise and grace AC Andrews keep up the good work we need more pictures of this caliber",1340236800,,622,4.148760330578512

2769202,4,B000NIVPA8,I got this movie because I had read the books series by V.C. Andrews and I wanted to watch the movie. It was a good movie but they changed a lot from the book. I'm still glad that I bought it but I wish they had stuck more to the storyline of the novel. If you read the book than I think you should watch the movie.,1298505600,,315,3.716417910447761

2769204,4,B000NIVPA8,"While the movie was good. As a movie alone it was powerful and moving and had just the right touch of Hope and Fantasy  that every Girl dreams of. However, In Comparison to the book I was rather disapointed, there was much left out of the story and many loose ends that those not following the Books will be left to wonder about.  Watch the movie before you read the books or Vice versa its up to you but In my Opinion the power of V.C. Andrews' Books Set the Stage for your Imagination Better than hollywood ever could.",1277251200,,520,4.242424242424242
2769205,3,B000NIVPA8,"I thought it was OK thats it.  The book was way better than the movie.  The movie left out so many parts but overall its ok.  I agree with the person who said earlier that her singing wasn't all that great, at least not for a standing ovation.  But I'm so glad I only paid $2.00 bucks for it.  It should have been a lifetime movie.",1274313600,,331,3.9545454545454546

2769207,3,B000NIVPA8,"This was an unexpected treat. I enjoyed the performance by Brooklyn Sudano as the main character Rain. Personally I never heard of the film, but when I'd seen previews of it on another dvd I was watching I went online to order it. It was good to see actor Robert Loggia who'd always been one of my favorites. Faye Dunaway's performance as the grandmother was grand! And another actress I admire is Khandi Alexander from CSI:Miami fame. If you want to see a good drama with lots to offer, this is it. After seeing Rain go thru all the heartache, pain, and terror she did and come out on top was inspiring!",1252540800,,604,4.401785714285714
2769208,2,B000NIVPA8,"The movie was really good, but compared with the book I was a bit disappointed.. I feel they didn't portray some aspects of the characters, especially Rain.. Anyway, there wasn't even a Novella of the new book, Gathering Clouds.. that was the main reason I wanted the movie. Because I read from a V.C. Andrews fan site that they are sold with the DVD and got the link to buy the movie from that website. So that really irritated me. And now I can't even find the novella with a DVD. So if anyone knows how I can get that Novella, let me know because I wanted to read it. :)

Thanks.",1251763200,2,582,4.196428571428571
2769209,2,B000NIVPA8,"They seriously need to stop dragging VC Andrews's name through the mud. If you have read the Hudson series and ended up watching this movie, then I think you'd expect it to be at least halfway decent. If you have not read the series and are watching this from a completely unbaised view, then I guess the movie would be ok.
I could name a few hundred things that are so wrong with this movie but that would take me all day. So I'll just stick with a couple. In the book, her sister was the mean one and always ripping on her with the other girls. But in the movie, she was protrayed as the pathetic, weak one and her death wasn't even played out right. She was murdered inside the warehouse, not outside. The lead gang member was hardly believable as a hardened and evil criminal. His facial expressions actually cracked me up, they were so funny.
Victoria should've played more of a role and Brody and Allison weren't even mentioned. The love Roy had for Rain wasn't even touched upon. I think Rain was an actor in the book, not a singer. And she wasn't even that good of a singer. In the book, the Hudsons lived on a second floor apartment building. In the movie, they lived in a house. I think if you're going to make a movie from a book, then you should at least attempt to get some of the details from it right. Otherwise, what's the point?? The only decent actor was Rain's adoptive mother.
Another big disappointment for such a huge fan of VC Andrews (not Andrew Niederman!) *sigh*",1249171200,,1488,4.356115107913669
2769210,1,B000NIVPA8,"I was so pissed off!! I read the whole series. Great cast, but terrible!! Man, it wasn't even half way like the book. They left important parts out of the movie. Like, when Rain's brother having feeling for her and when she got in those fights with those girls and etc.... It was very disappointing. Don't waste your time.",1245542400,,322,4.47457627118644

2769212,4,B000NIVPA8,"If you've ever read the book, you can immediately pick out the differences between the two. After I got the book out of my head and stopped comparing the two could I enjoy this movie. When I heard this movie came with a novella that goes with the Hudson series of V.C. Andrews novels I just had to get it. I have yet to read the 48 page book, but as soon as I'm done with End of the Rainbow I will read it.",1238457600,,406,3.8452380952380953
2769213,4,B000NIVPA8,I am a huge VC Andrews fan and am pretty skeptical of the movies but this one was very good. I liked it almost as much as the book. I especially enjoyed recieving the bonus book with it. I would recommend this movie whether they liked the book or not.,1236816000,,251,4.04
2769214,5,B000NIVPA8,I watched this movie last night & I must say it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. There are a few unanswered questions in the movie. It did also seem like the movie was moving too fast. Like the directors & producers where trying to fit everything into 2 hours. I wished the movie would have been longer. Overall I did enjoy this movie. I think it is worth a watch.,1234396800,,384,4.0

2769216,3,B000NIVPA8,"The movie was okay. But the book is so much better. They left out so much.
If you ever seen Flowers in the Attic by the same Author that was very good.",1228694400,,151,3.75
2769217,4,B000NIVPA8,"By the end of this movie, to be quite honest, I found myself feeling rather disappointed. The plot and storyline were interesting and had great potential but the movie was done badly, often overacted and somewhat cliched. In spite of this, I liked the way the main character Rain was portrayed and I casually thought the actress did a good job. Until she sang that last song at the end of the movie and I was blown away. It seems that the actress Brooklyn Sudano both wrote and preformed that song herself.. I wonder why doesn't she have an album out?! And so, as that performance made watching this movie worthwhile, I give it 4 stars.",1225065600,,636,4.491379310344827
2769218,4,B000NIVPA8,"I watched the movie ""Rain"" for the first time last night. It was quite enjoyable. It was also inspirational. I enjoy movies that show persurverance. People had a tendancy to give up too easily and lose hope. These types of movies are always a breath of fresh air. I always look for the lessons in them.",1214784000,,302,4.410714285714286
2769219,3,B000NIVPA8,"I've read VC Andrews since I was a child.  Personally I think they should have made a movie about the Casteel Series before the Hudson Series.  I still purchased the DVD b/c I am a loyal reader.  It didn't follow the story of the book which is normal for most movies.  It's just that certain things were so off, like in the book Rain was into theater, in the movie she was a singer.  I can understand changing some things to make it flow better as a movie but changing things about the character just seemed unnecessary and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  If you are a VC Andrews fan I would buy this dvd just to add it to your collection but I'd recommend you DO NOT read Rain before watching it.",1187136000,7,699,4.102941176470588
2769220,5,B000NIVPA8,"I am not a fan of V.C. Andrews work - or the ghostwriter. I approached this for the first time as a movie that an old acquaintance, Brooklyn Sudano, was in.  That having been said, I definitely enjoyed the movie - I thought the plot was creative - even though tried and true - had enough nuances to keep my attention.

I thought the book was a neat extra - but I would have loved to have seen more, a featurette, and some interviews.",1186531200,3,433,4.142857142857143
2769221,5,B000NIVPA8,I loved it! I sincerely hope they will make more V.C. Andrews movies and mini-series! The movie was excellently done; wonderful music score; and perfect casting. And it makes you want to read the entire series.,1184716800,8,210,4.861111111111111
2769222,5,B000NIVPA8,"I enjoyed watching VC Andrews' RAIN on DVD. I am a long time fan of VC Andrews and Andrew Neiderman's work, but being an adoptive mom made me need to see this story come to life, and I was not disappointed.
I read the four book series that inspired the DVD and feel that the story was written the way it should be written. When a person who has been adopted is suddenly plunked down amongst her birth roots, it must be a scary as well as beautiful thing to deal with.
I have been through this with my bi-racial adopted daughter and I was satisfied with how this delicate subject was handled in fictional form. Bravo! And thanks a million! I am going to share this with my daughter, Star. Star, Rain...the universe is a wonderful place when and only when you find out who you really are.",1183420800,8,786,4.281879194630872

Her mother played by Khandi Alexander strives to provide for her and her two siblings although their dad, played by Giancarlo Esposito, lives with them. Rain is determined not to fall victim to the streets; however her younger sister is rebellious. While trying to protect her younger sister, Rain witnesses a murder and has to be sent away to live with her biological grandmother played by Faye Dunaway.

The insert of a booklet with the DVD as a bonus was great. I enjoyed reading the backstory to the movie.

Rain is a movie that will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. ~ Shelia M. Goss, entertainment writer and National Bestselling author of Paige's Web and My Invisible Husband",1182729600,3,748,4.746153846153846

2769226,5,B000NIVPA8,"Rain.  Also the name of the 4 book series from V. C. Andrews.  This was a very enjoyable movie.  Brooklyn Sudano (Donna Summer's daughter) really captured the heart, soul, and essence of this amazing young woman.  All of V.C. Andrews women are amazing, be they young naive women who grow into astounding adults or the evil grandmothers who always, deep down, have a heart, even if they hide it well.

Faye Dunaway was brilliant.  I can't imagine a better choice for this movie.  Robert Loggia was incredible.  I have to admit I really came to hate the villian who blackmailed and then tried to kill Rain.  A different twist from the book, but superbly worked into the movie.  You always have to hate someone in a V.C. Andrews novel / movie!

Why this was not released in theatres is beyond me.  There's a lot of crap that gets released and then fades away to DVD.  This movie was not given the star quality it deserved.  Yes, the ""sequel"" inside the movie answered some questions but really left me wanting more, more!  Shame on Pocket Books for not publishing this as a full length VCA novel.  Megan was really fascinating!

The screen play was by Andrew Neiderman who is also the VCA ghostwriter.  You've seen Mr. Neiderman's work before in The Devil's Advocate, an adaption of his own fine novel.  Now, we all have to keep our fingers crossed for a remake of the disappointing Flowers in the Attic movie!  LONG LIVE VCA STORIES AND MOVIES!",1181174400,4,1442,4.580392156862745
2769227,1,B000NIVPA8,"The Rain series is probably one of my favorites.  I was extremely excited when I heard a movie was coming out.  However, the movie was a huge disappointment.  They tried to attempt to be true to the book but I was not impressed with the gang member angle.  He really had no purpose because in the book who dies from a drug overdose.  I really would have liked to see Brody and Allison in the movie.  One positive thing is that Faye Dunaway did a wonderful job portraying Isabel Hudson.  Brooklyn Sudano performance was okay.  I agreed with others who said they skipped around to much and it did remind me of a made for TV movie.  Overall, it was just ok and it could have been a whole lot better.  I suggest they don't attempt to make any more movies based on VC Andrews books.  It simple disappoints many of her fans.",1181001600,,818,4.281045751633987
2769228,1,B000NIVPA8,"As many V.C. Andrews fans know, this is based on the book of the same name.  The book wasn't all that great, in my opinion.  It was written by Andrew Neiderman, the ghost writer for V.C. Andrews (V.C.A. has been dead now for 20 years).  Neiderman also wrote the screenplay for this movie.  I feel he butchered his own story, and the story wasn't all that wonderful to begin with.  Many fans will know that even the book was a retread of previous series he wrote under V.C. Andrews name, only with a black lead character.  I say this so everybody knows the history behind this movie.  I do not recommend the book if you haven't read it.

This movie was of poor quality. It didn't have much of a point. The point was pretty much how Rain rises to the top and pleases the rich grandma she never knew she had until recently. This is supposed to be emotionally affecting because Rain's of mixed race and comes from a poor background. Her grandmother's white and wealthy.  I found the message simplistic, actually. There have been movies that have carried off such a message well.  This one doesn't.  It just doesn't try hard enough at all to get you invested in the characters.  This movie could have been a whole lot better. A movie can be cliche and still have a twist or enough heart to keep you hooked. This movie doesn't even manage that. Here's the basic plot:

Rain finds out she's adopted, then her sister is murdered by gang members and her life is in danger so she has to live with her real grandmother. Her grandmother looks down on her at first, but then she starts to warm to her when she sees what great posture she has and how nicely she dresses. She's also polite and well-behaved.  Rain is musically inclined so Grandma enrolls her in a music school.  Meanwhile, the gang members  are trying to hunt Rain down.

Then there's Corbette; he's the big man on campus, so we're told, and he's interested in Rain.  They do a duet together but beyond that, nothing happens between them.  His character has the charm of a piece of cardboard.  Like most of the characters, he was only in the movie because he was in the book.  His character was completely altered.  What little personality he possessed on the page, gone.  As for Rain, I think we could have been made to care about her more.

I found the scene where Rain proves her knowledge of Hamlet to her snobby classmates to be incredibly obnoxious. But I think it was in the book too. It was a classic triumph of the underdog moment. And not very emotionally affecting. Her teacher says how the play is about more than a murder and looks to her to back the statement up. And she goes on to say how the story deals with ""life and love"". She could have at least said something a little more profound if they were going to make a big thing about how smart she is. Seriously.  Teacher:  ""What did you think about The Great Gatsby?""  Student:  Wonderful book about life and love. Teacher:  ""What did you think about Anna Karenina?""  Student:  Oh, it made me question what I'd always believed about life and love."" Come on.  The audience deserves a better answer than that.

Now for the acting. Some of the actors did poorly, some were passable. Most of this is the fault of what they were given to work with.

And now for those who read the book:

Brody and Alison were completely taken out.  Victoria comes and goes, basically to show her disapproval of Rain and that's all. She was literally in the movie just to be in the movie. She was only in the movie for a total of about five or so minutes, divided up between two or three scenes. She could have easily been cut out of the movie and it wouldn't have affected the plot at all.  There's no real depth given to any of the characters. They just show up, play their little role and that's it.
 All traces of incest were taken out, which is not a bad thing at all. The incest didn't really serve any purpose in the book, after all.  It was only in the book because that's what people have come to expect of anything under the V.C. Andrews logo.

Edit: As for the prequel that comes with the movie, I hear it's in booklet form, and only 48 pages long (though the type is allegedly small.)  I'm not sure if it still comes with the movie or not, since it is now a year or so later.  Maybe.  I don't know.

Edit II:  I will say this.  I think Neiderman did the best he possibly could with his own material.  I imagine it's hard to fill the shoes of another writer, and just as hard to adapt your own book for the screen.  So I feel like I should give him a break.  That said, my sympathy does not make this a good movie.",1180742400,2,4622,4.306264501160093
2769229,5,B000NIVPA8,"This movie was outstanding!  It held my attention and kept me wanting more.  This was one of those movies that I found disappointing when it ended.  I wanted to see more!  The movie was well done in every way.  I was in tears at times and felt the pain of the actors.  I will watch this one many times and share with my friends and family members.

It was refreshing to find a movie that wasn't full of continual elicit sex scenes and vulgarities.  Well done!!!!

2769230,1,B000NIVPA8,"I have been a fan of VC Andrew's book since my freshman year  in college. I really enjoyed reading Rain when I found out it had been made into a movie I was little slow in wanting to see( I saw Flowers in the Attic and I did not enjoy the movie at all) I was going to buy it but decided to rent it instead. I am so glad I saved myself some money, the movie was a big disappointment. I agree with the person that stated that movie did stick somewhat to the book, the only problem was so many parts where missing and I also thought this was a made for televison movie. If another book is turned into a movie I hope the persons that are responible for the movie do a better job. So far that two attempts at turning VC Andrew's books into movies have not been sucessful. The books are great. May be I will just stick to reading the books and forget about watching the movies.",1180569600,,871,4.005747126436781
2769231,4,B000NIVPA8,"Like most V. C. Andrews' fans, I was skeptical of a Rain movie.  Well, I have to say this movie surprised me.  Brooklyn Sudano is wonderful as Rain Arnold.  I was wary of the changing of acting to singing would be a problem but I was wrong.  Sudano sings amazingly (and she should, she's Donna Summer's daughter) and the singing talent works better on film than acting.  The movie follows pretty closely to the book, leaving out things here and there.  A new twist in the movie of the gang that kills Benny tries to steal from Mrs. Hudson was good.  Faye Dunaway does a wonderful job of capturing the character of Isabel Hudson.  Robert Loggia is great as Jake and Khandi Alexander is good as Latisha Arnold.  One complaint is that the movie seems to jump around a lot and also plays like a T.V. movie.  All in all it certainly a better adaptation than the Flowers in the Attic movie.",1180483200,2,884,4.401234567901234
2769232,1,B000NIVPA8,"You know, I'm not even sure where to begin in expressing my extreme disappointment with this film.  I absolutely loved the book, and while I know that no movie can convey all of the feelings and emotions of the written word, this movie sadly didn't even attempt it.

The movie was loosely based on the book at best.  Key parts were left out and replaced with a pathetic subplot about the gangbangers who murdered Rain's sister.  Relationships were altered to the point of being unrecognizable.  I believe any fan of the novel will share in my disappointment.

In addition to the horrible adaptation, the acting was pathetic.  Sudano wasn't terrible, but she definitely wasn't good (she does have a wonderful voice, however).  The only acting that didn't make me want to swear off movies forever was that of Dunaway and Loggia.  Don't even get me started on the tin-foil grilled idiot who MUST be related to one of the filmmakers to warrant such a large role - and one that wasn't even a part of the book.

I have looked forward to seeing this movie since I first heard it was in production.  Now I see why it didn't make it to theaters...I only wish I could rate it lower than one star.",1178928000,3,1186,4.52112676056338
