7897890,1,6305898871,"This DVD (and it's second volume) are absolutely unacceptable as anything other than complete trash. What a disappointment! For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible! It honestly looks worse than a VHS video. (No joke here.) There are noticeable glitches, it looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a VCR as this was being transferred to DVD! Most of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and most (95%) of the songs have the beginnings cut-off (mid-lyric) and the ends just chopped. I don't believe one video is complete. Some videos are so washed-out it's ridiculous. There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed. Please don't waste your time on this thing. Unbelievable!",989193600,16,765,4.937984496124031
7897891,1,6305898871,"Being a fan of music videos from the early 80's, I was looking forward to this DVD.  What a disappointment.  I honestly suspect that this disc is a bootleg production that has somehow managed to sneak by the record labels.  For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible.  It looks worse than a VHS video.  There are noticeable glitches throughout.  It looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a video cassette player as this was being transferred to DVD! A couple of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and ""Breaking Us in Two"" by Joe Jackson is missing about the final 1/3 of the song!  There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed, furthering the notion that this is a bootleg. How many compilations have you seen or heard where the original source is not credited? Please don't waste your time on this thing.",984614400,7,900,4.5875
7897892,1,6305898871,"This DVD is the worst i've ever seen. I can't imagine how they put it on  the market. The video and audio qualities are absolutely poor. It seems that  the guys that produced it, took the videos from an old VHS and record them  on the DVD. Most of them are cuted, are incomplete. I think that someone  should have cheked the quality first before launching this product to the  market. I would not recomend this DVD to anyone.",965952000,11,425,4.329113924050633
7897893,1,6305898871,"At 48 mins,with grainy picture and mono sound - even though several of these tracks were originally in stereo - this DVD is a waste of time, unless you are a fanatical collector... This volume plus #2 together on one  DVD might just be worth $.  The idea is a good one though, as there  currently seem to be no pop/rock music omnibus collections in the vein of  ""Now That's What I Call Music"" on DVD.",965260800,6,400,4.223684210526316
