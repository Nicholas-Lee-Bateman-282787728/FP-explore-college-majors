8133347,5,B000GL18FY,"I was turned on to this band in my youth and have always loved them. This video is a wonderful story of a band that I thought I knew a lot about. I've read many article and stories on Alex and the boys through out the years, but this DVD told me quite a bit more than I thought I knew. I have already watched it several times (whenever a friend who hasn't seen it comes over) and find more detail each time.",1387238400,2,407,3.9156626506024095
8133348,5,B000GL18FY,Great to learn how much this group influenced later groups. DVD arrived in good time and was well packaged. The Sensational Alex harvey Band is a much under-rated group.,1350432000,,169,4.862068965517241

Factory or Reelin' In The Years Productions???  Someone better put a call in to VAMBO AND BIG LOUIE......",1283904000,,282,5.108695652173913
8133350,5,B000GL18FY,"I was slow at ordering this because I didn't know what to expect.  I gave in and boy am I glad!  There are only 3 full videos of music, Delilah, Runaway and Gamblin' Bar Room Blues..BUT the interviews by with the band - intersped between live concert cuts are VERY INTERESTING.  After watching this it made me pull out all my SAHB CD's (which are out of print - go figure) and give them a listen.

  I only wish that they put together a DVD of all the complete live footage on this DVD. Their official web site tells of a Sept 2008 release of the original mix of the Impossible Dream CD.  I hope that more stuff see's the light of day, such as the complete LIVE CD recordings.

 Perhaps one day the SAHB CD's will be back in print...let's hope so.

 VAMBO ROOLS!",1217376000,6,762,4.186206896551724
