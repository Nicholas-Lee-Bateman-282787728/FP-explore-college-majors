629269,4,6303359574,"In the early 19th century, a woman in foreign garb is found walking the English countryside. Her language is a mystery. Is she the lost princess of South Pacific island, a lunatic, or someone else entirely? This is the central question of Princess Caraboo, whose title character is wonderfully played by the alternatively child-like and proud Phoebe Cates. Kevin Kline and John Lithgow deliver very funny performances as, respectively, the suspicious Greek butler of the family that ""adopts"" Caraboo and a professor called in to determine whether she's a fraud. Through it all, Stephen Rea provides a quiet, consistent presence as a journalist fascinated by Caraboo's story, whatever it may really be (though Rea's hair is disturbingly similar to Richard Simmons' here). This is a good rental film, filled both with these performances and gorgeous scenes of the English countryside. And it is not without a relevant message: do we not hope that those around us may turn out to be more than they seem, so that we may either profit by our association with them or, if they turn out to be infamous, come out looking superior? A pleasant 4-star diversion.",998956800,3,1151,5.0
629270,3,6303359574,This is an excellent film beautifully acted surprisingly by Phoebe Cates as well as a wonderful supporting cast. Jim Broadbent as the drunken Mr Worell is hilarious and pitiful at the same time.(He is currently in Moulin Rouge as Mr. Ziedler and was in Topsy Turvy as well.) Stephen Rea is marvelous as the intelligent reporter and Kevin Kline (Phoebe's husband in real life the last time I heard.) Has a great role as Frixos the head butler. What a charming and delightful tale. Unfortunately you would think studios would have figured out by now that DVD's need more features to sell as well as a choice of Widescreen or Standard. This one is ONLY in Standard and very little in the way of specila features...,994291200,9,711,4.650793650793651
629271,4,6303359574,"Princess Caraboo is simultaneously a wonderful fairy tale of a lost princess who survives harrowing adventures in a foreign land, and also a  light treatment of a period of social unrest and class struggle in historic  England.
The fairy tale is the more compelling of the two aspects,  which makes this movie a wonderful film for adults and children alike.  Cates' unswerving imperial manner juxtaposed with her childlike wonder are  engrossing not only to us, the audience, but to the people swept up in her  adventure, especially the wonderful Stephen Rea as a cynical journalist  transformed by her strength and beauty.
The social commentary is touched  upon only lightly and occasionally, making the resolution to the question  of the princess somewhat of a letdown; we aren't really given anough  information to understand how she got to where she did. (Sorry for the  vagueness -- I'm avoiding spoilers, here.)  However, the concurrent  resolution of the problems of Mrs. Warren, the kind lady who took in the  princess, is worth whatever confusion or incompleteness there might  be.
Overall, this is a delightful story for all ages, which sparks the  imagination and holds your interest until the very last moment.",961891200,11,1222,5.126903553299492

Can't remember seeing Phoebe Cates in anything other than FAST TIMES (and many issues of 17 magazine) but she is perfectly cast and convincing here.  You can look to the jacket copy for plot, etc.-- but what stands out about this movie is its originality, gentle humor, social/historical message.

629460,5,6303359574,"I had a bit of a wait to get this on DVD, having once owned it on VHS, but it's all I remembered it to be - a charming Brit Flick with humor and a twist. Phoebe Cates was astounding, as was the entire cast, especially Kevin Kline as a Greek butler. But Jim Broadbent and Wendy Hughes as the ""star-struck"" couple of means who take in the ""exotic"" Cates were splendid for opposite reasons: he, because he changed his mind about her when he though she'd make him rich; she, because she was gracious from the beginning, but later got to be almost subservient when she thought Cates was a ""princess."" Even Stephen Rhea, who discovers the truth of the story, finds love in the end, and John Lithgow is wonderful as the Oxford professor who can't discover the language Cates is speaking, but is so enchanted (and in love) with her that he offers a hypothesis for her origins to Broadbent, a crooked banker, and his partner, a spice merchant. When the Prince Regent of England gets involved, all manner of mischief is afoot. At one point, in the middle of the film, the ""princess"" attends a recital of a piece by Schubert that brings tears to her eyes. It's rather moving, especially since she obviously is not acquainted with music of this type, and it piques your curiosity even more about her origins.
I don't know how I was introduced to this film in the first place, but I suspect it was on a ""Manager's Picks"" shelf at a local video store. Very, very worthwhile and engaging film.",1342915200,3,1478,4.4575645756457565

629465,4,6303359574,"If you're anywhere close to my generation, then teen films like THE BREAKFAST CLUB and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH will resonate more for you. Phoebe Cates remains an icon to folks like me, and what dude didn't have a crush on her, a crush brought about mostly from that one oh-so-memorable image of her from FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (yeah, you know the one). But, as it turns out, with mad respect to FAST TIMES, my favorite Phoebe Cates movie is PRINCESS CARABOO.

The summer of 1817 finds the peace of an English village shattered by the arrival of a fetching, oddly-garbed vagabond. Arrested for vagrancy, the young woman's imperious bearing and indecipherable tongue impress the aristocratic Mrs. Worrall, who takes her in. It doesn't take too long for word to get around that the Worralls are housing East Indian royalty and that her name is ""Princess Caraboo,"" so-called for that oft-repeated word of hers. As well, it dawns on the Worralls, who rank somewhere near the bottom of high society, that sponsoring the exotic princess bears potential for advancing their status and wealth. In time Caraboo's story trickles out, of her abduction from her palace by pirates and her escape from captivity by jumping off a merchant ship and into the Bristol Channel. She becomes a sensation amongst the elite social circles, and soon quite a few of the priveleged are sporting a turban.

Others aren't convinced, including the Worrall's household servants who from the start speculate about the girl's true origins. Kevin Kline (Cates' real life hubby) is equally droll and annoying and very over-the-top as the skeptical, insolent Greek butler who strives so hard to disprove Caraboo's pedigree - but even he is won over. John Lithgow appears as an Oxford linguist whose efforts are stymied by Caraboo until he at last slumps away in defeat. Caraboo's biggest detractor may well be the journalist Mr. John Gutch, played with a jaded air by Stephen Rea. In Gutch, one may detect a carefully hidden bump of wistfulness, but that's not near enough to keep him from doggedly pursuing the truth. But it makes him more likeable.

If only Merchant Ivory pictures were more like PRINCESS CARABOO, I'd be a lot more high class and snooty by now, brother. PRINCESS CARABOO unfolds as a charming 19th century fable and a satire of the English social classes. Thanks to the actors, and mostly to Cates' winning performance, the skimpy premise doesn't wear itself out. The story is based on actual events, with, of course, a bit of the embellished here and there. It actually saddens me a bit to learn that the romance between Caraboo and Mr. Gutch, unconvincing though it is, is a thing of fiction, because these two are appealing characters. But the film barely develops this romance. I don't know that Mr. Gutch warning the princess that perjury is a hanging offense or Caraboo wishing him goodbye (""Kola feni foo"") are enough to merit courtship. Cates and Rea barely share scenes together.

As Mr. Gutch states, people believe two things: what they read in the paper and what they want to believe. Princess Caraboo may or may not be an actual princess - we don't find out until near the very end  in one affecting moment - but gullibility is demonstrated front and center when the Prince Regent hosts a ball in Princess Caraboo's honor and the princess leads the besotted highborn into a silly conga line dance.

Cates has the challenging gig of ingratiating herself to the audience even as she's restricted to eccentric gestures and to dialogue consisting of jibber jabber. Yet her expressiveness wins out. And, of course, it helps that Phoebe Cates looks like Phoebe Cates, a sexy waif. Here's a toast from the film (and I'll leave it up to you to guess who airs this sentiment): ""To Her Royal Highness. She not Greek. She not French. She not Indian. She not African. She not Russian. She our own princess. Long live the Princess Caraboo."" In the end, irregardless of Caraboo's true nature, regal or not, I guess we can take away two things from this movie: that you may be surprised by how far you'd get, with composure and with creativity given free reign. The other thing is, damn, is Phoebe Cates fine or what?

629520,4,6303359574,"Based upon a true story, this is a charming film with wonderful performances by a stellar cast. It tells the tale of a mysterious young woman (Phoebe Cates) in nineteenth century England, who is found wandering the countryside dressed in outlandish clothing and supposedly speaking no English. She is taken in by a kindly aristocratic family, and she gulls them into believing that she is some sort of exotic, foreign royal, Princess Caraboo.

Princess Caraboo charms all who meet her. Everyone is intrigued by her. Just who is she and where is she from? The Greek butler (Kevin Kline) thinks that she is an imposter. The aristocratic couple ( Jim Broadbent and Wendy Hughes), who virtually adopt her, believe her to be the real deal. The skeptical academic (John Lithgow), who specializes in Southeastern Asian languages and dialects and was brought in to try and determine her origin, is not immune to the charm of Princess Caraboo. Even the intrepid reporter, Mr. Gutch (Stephen Rea), who is onto something that may reveal the mystery of Princess Caraboo, falls under her spell.

Phoebe Cates outdid herself, giving a wonderful performance in an inherently difficult role that calls for speaking very little, and when she does speak it is, for the most part, to utter what sounds like gibberish. She is very expressive and totally charms the viewer. Jim Broadbent and Wendy Hughes are terrific as the aristocratic couple. Kevin Kline gives an over the top performance as the wily Greek butler. John Lithgow is outstanding as the academic and drolly funny. Stephen Rea is wonderful as the conflicted reporter, giving a well nuanced and sensitive performance.

629523,5,6303359574,"This is such a wonderful movie -- engaging, humorous, delightful, romantic, and based on a real event.  Beautifully acted and produced, with wonderful costumes, it also provides good fodder for a family discussion of human values.

629524,5,6303359574,"This is a thoroughly charming story.  Phoebe Cates is a marvel, and puts in a terrifically nuanced performance.  Stephen Rea is a perfect Gutch, a subdued rabbit of a reporter who has the journalistic sense to sniff out and test a story, and yet may not have the nerve to shake up his life in order to claim the woman he loves.  Yeesh, that sounds like something out of Danielle Steele, but trust me, the story is ravishing, but not the least gushy or ""rouged"".  Reminds me, though, that the other thing we've seen Cates in, was a Steele-ish series, and ... well, Cates is a perfectly beguiling Caraboo/Baker (so beguiling a Caraboo, it is really a shock to find that she is actually Mary Baker), which you may not expect from the sort of ""potboiler"" casting of this other, Steele-ish thing.  Lithgow as a skeptic-don-turned-true-believer ... I am not a huge Lithgow fan, but he is perfect is this supporting role;  he carries off both ends of the transition admirably.  I am astonished to read that a reviewer finds fault with Kline.  Both Lithgow and Kline perform with expertly-gauged restraint;  in comparison, Jim Broadbent's Mr Worrall is buffoonish, but this too is in perfect service to the story.  Indeed, there is a (distant) comparison to be made between Broadbent/Kline and Bertie Wooster/Jeeves ... the light-of-intellect master, and the shrewd-but-always-decorous servant.  Even Kline's zealous ""testing"" of Caraboo in the Worralls' absence, is brilliantly measured.
The whole cast perform wonderfully;  the camera-work is a delight;  the story is enchanting.  If you haven't seen it, why, remedy this appalling oversight immediately!",1047600000,5,1648,5.078066914498141

We popped this movie in the VCR after Thanksgiving dinner and soon had three generations of our family happily involved in discovering whether the title character was truly royalty or perpetrating an elaborate hoax.  The English accents and the bumbling adults may be too much for the very youngest viewers, but from pre-teen on up, this was a crowd-pleaser.
I don't think it was made with children in mind, but without sex, strong language, or violence, it is perfect for anyone with a decent attention span.
