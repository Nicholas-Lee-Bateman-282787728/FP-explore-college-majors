1) The Basham Brothers vs. Rikishi/Scotty 2 Hotty - Ok match.  Good opener.  I would've liked to see the bashams win, but still it was an ok match - *** 1/2 stars
2) Nidia vs. Jamie Noble - Stupid match.  Waste of time - ** stars
3) The APA vs. Haas/Benjamin - Good match.  Good tag team action.  I really like Haas/Benjamin and I'm glad they won this one - **** stars
4) Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr - Great match.  Rey hit a dazzling array of moves and the match was made better by Chavo Sr. and Jorge Paez @ ringside - **** stars
5) John Cena vs. Kurt Angle vs. The Big Show - What a match.  The three men exchanged their finishers throughout the match.  The right man won - **** 1/2 stars
6) Eddy Guerrero vs. Brock Lesnar - WWE championship match - The perfect finish to a great show.  Brock had Guerrero beat at many points during the match, but Eddy wouldn't quit!! In the end Eddy won with an amazing 5 star frog splash to become the champ!!!!! - ***** stars
- Overall I thought it was a great show.  If you like pure nonstop action this is the show for you.  It stareted slow, but the last three matches were brethtaking.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Eddy guerrero as this was truly his night to shine.",1076803200,,1324,4.165354330708661

2004465,4,B0001IN076,"For some reason, Torrie Wilson and Sable opened the show, standing in the ring and welcoming everyone to the show. I don't know what reason that was for. But okay.

1.) 3 on 2 Tag Team Championship Handicap Match: The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua vs Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi (c)

This was a good opener to start off the night. It was a common thing back then to see the women and men mix it up in the ring and Shaniqua really stood well in the ring with Scotty and Rikishi. Shaniqua tended to work over Scotty at many times throughout the match even manhandling him at times. Rikishi gets the tag and attempts a Stinkface on Shaniqua but the Bashams stop him. Eventually Rikishi and Scotty take out the Bashams and Rikishi flattens Shaniqua with a Banzai Drop to get the win

__________________________________________________________________

2.) Blindfold Match: Jamie Noble vs Nidia

This is where the PPV begins to decline. Basically Nidia went blind after Tajiri sprayed black poisonous mist into her eyes. While she was blind, Jamie took advantage of her and once her vision was restored, she turned on him. So it lead to this match with Noble being blindfolded, while Nidia messed with him and humiliated him. Semi-comical match to say the least. Noble peeks under the blindfold behind the refs back and gets the win with a choke hold on Nidia. This marked the permanent split of Jamie Noble and Nidia. Noble remained an underutilized Cruiserweight, while Nidia went to Raw as a babyface

__________________________________________________________________

3.) The Worlds Greatest Tag Team vs APA

An okay Tag Team match that's nothing special. WGGT get the win, following a superkick from Shelton Benjamin
__________________________________________________________________

There was a nice segment where newly Smackdown General Manager Paul Heyman confronted Goldberg, who was sitting ringside. Heyman taunts Goldberg continuously, which brings out Brock Lesnar. The segment ends with Goldberg jumping the barricade and attacking Lesnar before getting arrested and escorted out of the arena by security. More great build-up to their horrible Wrestlemania match

__________________________________________________________________

4.) Hardcore Holly vs Rhyno

A complete snoozefest of a filler match. Either skip this match or nap through it. Holly wins with the Alabama Slam

__________________________________________________________________

5.) Cruiserweight Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero w/Chavo Guerrero Sr. vs Rey Mysterio (c) w/Jorge Paez

After 2 rather lackluster matches, the PPV begins to pick up with this amazing Cruiserweight match. The Cruiserweights back then used to put on some show stealing matches . Rey and Chavo really brought down the house in this match and was probably their best match in WWE (as well as their Great American Bash match). Chavo gets the win with assistance from Guerrero Sr. Awesome match, no doubt! Makes me wish the Cruiserweight Division was back in WWE

__________________________________________________________________

6.) #1 Contender Triple Threat Match: Kurt Angle vs Big Show vs John Cena

Great solid Triple Threat match from all 3 men! Very entertaining with non-stop back and forth action. The story surrounding this match was that on the previous Smackdown, Kurt Angle was found knocked unconscious backstage. Angle had a feeling that it was either Big Show or John Cena (it never was discovered who attacked Angle). Angle was pretty much the favorite going into this match but all 3 competitors looked to have a fair shot of winning. Angle wins by making Cena tap to the Ankle Lock. Very good match!

__________________________________________________________________

7.) WWE Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero vs Brock Lesnar (c)

A David vs Goliath type of brawl was our main event. Eddie Guerrero was fighting not only for the WWE Championship but also for everything he worked for, including his reputation. The odds were really stacked against Eddie leading up to the match so there was no question he was the underdog going into this match. Lesnar dominated Guerrero most of the match, but that shouldn't be a surprise, considering just how physical Brock is in the ring. Goldberg interfered mid-way through the match and speared Brock but Brock still managed to kick out. After an F5 reversal into a DDT on the championship belt, while the ref was knocked out; Eddie capitalized with a Frog Splash to win his first WWE Championship. The post-victory celebration was an emotional one for Eddie and a memorable one for fans as he dove into the crowd and hugged his mother before standing atop the announcer's table with the title to close the PPV.

Overall: An okay first Smackdown PPV of 2004. Most matches were great but there were those few that were just a bore. This marked the beginning of Eddie Guerrero's WWE Championship reign, the last PPV Kurt Angle would fight at as a babyface until the 2006 Royal Rumble and the true beginning to the Goldberg/Brock Lesnar feud at Wrestlemania XX",1397347200,,5074,5.300498753117207
2004466,3,B0001IN076,Interesting in that it highlights someone who in just a few short years would no longer be around. It's also interesting to see some of John Cena's early PPV appearances and compare the wrestler he was then with what he is now. What I also like is that it had decent tag team matches by teams that belonged together and were not just thrown together like they are now.,1367020800,,368,4.3478260869565215

2004468,4,B0001IN076,"Before I begin, I have a review of ""WWE Tagged Classics: No Way Out 2004 / Backlash 2004"" that will be pretty much the same thing that I type on this review.  Because this was one of my favorite events from 2004, I felt it was worth posting something.

So, with that little caveat, I hope this review influences your purchase, or at least gives you a fun little read.  Rock On!

*****NO WAY OUT 2004*****
Our show begins rather strangely, as Torrie Wilson and Sable to welcome us to the show.  I don't know what the point of this was, but we soon get the traditional video package and pyro before the first match.

1) 3-on-2 Handicap Match - WWE Tag Team Championships
The Basham Brothers & Shaniqua v. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (champions)
---Ironically, none of these five superstars work with the WWE anymore.  I actually really like this opener, mostly because it's WAY better than anybody could've guessed.  Shaniqua hangs in there with the men well enough, the Rikishi ""butt comedy"" is kept to a minimum, The Bashams use good teamwork, and Scotty actually got some believable offense in.  The match was a nice crowd energizer, in my opinion.
""7.5 / 10""
___________________________________________________

2) Blindfold Match
Jamie Noble v. Nidia
---This is actually misleading, as Noble is the only person who has to wear the blindfold.  Anyway, I think people forget just how successful this duo was for the year-and-a-half leading up to this encounter.  Keep in mind, the Cruiserweight division was awesome at this point, and fans loved to hate this lustful couple of vile rednecks.  As for the Blindfold Match, you either enjoy these silly events, or you don't.  Because the choreography was more skillful than usual, I was entertained enough.
""6.0 / 10"" (perhaps an inflated score)
___________________________________________________

3) The World's Greatest Tag Team v. The APA
---Well, one of my all-time favorite tag teams takes on one of the most overrated tag teams (in my opinion).  Regardless of which is which, this match is very boring, mostly because the two styles don't mix.  Seeing Bradshaw and Faarooq in rest holds is dull TV, especially when you want Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjmain to explode with their creative offense.  You have two older, slower veterans taking on two incredible athletes with a lot less experience.  I guess you now know which team I prefer.  Bottom line, skip this one.
""4.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

Next up is an interesting segment where Goldberg takes his seat in the front row, which prompts WWE champion Brock Lesnar and ""SmackDown"" GM Paul Heyman to taunt and yell at the ""RAW"" superstar. The whole thing ends when Goldberg jumps the barricade and attacks Lesnar, which gets Goldberg arrested.
___________________________________________________

4) Hardcore Holly v. Rhyno
---In a neat booking segue, Hardcore Holly comes out to punch Lesnar (his opponent from last month), which inspires to Rhyno slug it out with Holly to start their schedule match for NO WAY OUT. Too bad that the following match is a lifeless sleep-inducer. Other than a few counters involving the Alabama Slam, I couldn't tell you what else happens.  Look, both guys of these guys were never my favorites, but I've seen both of them enough to know they're capable of decent in-ring action.  Other than the creative beginning, this one sucks.
""3.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

5) Cruiserweight Championship
Chavo Guerrero (w/ Chavo Sr.) v.
Rey Mysterio (champion - w/ Jorge Paes)
---From this moment on, ""No Way Out 2004"" is a rousing success!  We go from one of the worst PPV matches of the year to my favorite match of 2004, if not of of my all-time faves from the WWE.  With respect to their impressive match at GREAT AMERICAN BASH a few months later, THIS one should've been on Mysterio's 3-disc set. Frankly, it's a shame that the WWE shelved the Cruiserweight division a few years ago, because matches like this can be show stealers. At this PPV, Chavo & Mysterio delivered a crisp near-perfect match with plenty of high-risk spots, flips & twirls, and smart submission wrestling. One of my criteria questions for Cruiserweight matches is, ""Do the high risks make sense?"" In this Chavo/Mysterio classic, they do, and they're practically flawless.  There's also a bit of fun involving Chavo Sr. and boxer Jorge Paes.  Honestly, I don't know why exactly they got involved in thie contest leading up to it, but they're only a small part of the big picturem, anyway.  Will you call this one your Match-of-2004? Probably not, but I promise you'll like it a lot.
""9.5 / 10""
___________________________________________________

6) #1 Contender Match - Winner Goes To ""WrestleMania XX""
Kurt Angle v. Big Show (United States champion) v. John Cena
---Because Chris Benoit defected to ""RAW"" after winning the 30-Man Royal Rumble, ""SmackDown"" needed a WWE Championship challenger.  This is actually an interesting point in time, because Cena was increasingly popular, the giant Big Show was the U.S. champ, and Kurt Angle was already respected as one of the best in pro wrestling history.  Any one of these men would've made good opponents for Brock Lesnar or Eddie Guerrero at the next PPV.  The match starts off pretty funny when Cena and Angle keep daring each other to go one-on-one with Big Show. Eventually, the match becomes a very entertaining 3-way competition, in which any of the three wrestlers could've won. I think the key to a good triple threat match is when you can't predict the winner; from bell to bell, I can still remember how Kurt Angle almost didn't win his #1 Contender spot.
""7.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

7) WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar (champion) v. Eddie Guerrero
---Our main event needs no introduction. Eddie Guerrero was always a hot commodity for ""SmackDown"", but this night instantly epitomized everything he worked so hard for, including his own life. Brock Lesnar was among the most physical of WWE champions, and really tossed & beat Guerrero's body for most of the match. I think people forget just how dominant Lesnar was in this match, with Guerrero barely hanging in there. It's actually a very good example of how a dominant villain & a beaten hero can create a very compelling underdog story.  I personally don't like that Goldberg set up Lesnar's demise, especially since their ""WrestleMania"" sendoff is one of pro wrestling's most embarassing catastrophes.  But then again, Guerrero's opportunism fits the character.  With his Lie-Cheat-Steal motto, we can't help but love as our Latino Heat takes his decisive Frog Splash to victory.  After all, why wouldn't that character take the WWE Championship for the very first time?  Besides, even if you throw out all the backstory, this is one heck of a good main event!
""8.0 / 10""
___________________________________________________

In the end, ""No Way Out 2004"" was probably the only good PPV to ever come from ""SmackDown"" that year. But more than that, it's a good show that any wrestling company would be proud of. It has a really slow patch in the middle, but the last three matches are among the year's best.",1259712000,,7227,5.04457527333894
2004469,3,B0001IN076,"overall ppv was about an6/10  8/10 apa vs. the worlds's greatest tag team: I was very suprised at how good this match was. Shelton Benjamin in particular was very good. He showed some very good athleticsm. Of course Bradshaw showed how powerful he was by powerbombing the hell out of Charlie Haas. But the turning point was when Shelton superkicked Bradshaw to pick up the win.

match 2. APA vs worlds greatest tag team
I""m not a fan of back to back tag team matches but this one was pretty good. This was true brutal wrestling and both teams deserve credit. the ending I thought was not good and really took away from this match. 2.5/5

If this match was a hardcore match it would've been a classic. Even though it wasn't these two put on a pretty good match. the ending was good and sealed the deal for the match. overall a good bout. 3/5

skip this match its horrible. 0/5

match 6. cruiserweight title rey mysterio(c) vs chavo guerrero
this match was great all the way to the end. Both these men are great wrestlers and their chemistry is perfect in the ring. These two make it look so easy like their not even trying. The match itself is matbased for a crusier weight match, the only thing keeping this from a classic is the ending was terrible. The wrong man won. 4/5

This match was terriffic. alot of high impact moves,good technical wrestling and just a good match. some people say that john cena is a horrible wrestler but he shows them wrong in this match. The ending is predictable but doesn't take anything awy from the match, solid performance. 4/5

match 8.wwe title brock lesnar(C) vs eddie Guerrero
One of the best matches ever. The dominant lesnar vs the underdog guerrero. This match was a good technical match for about the first 20 minutes were lesnar dominated. then guerrero started to take out lesnars legs. The last 15 minutes are classic wich included ref getting knocked out, interferance by goldberg, and a frog splash for the ages.

2004471,3,B0001IN076,"From his beginnings wrestling during the intermission with his nephew Chavo in Mexico at age 9 to being Tiger Mask in Japan to wrestling infront of a sold out crowd in a bingo hall to being held down in a promotion because of politics to dealing & overcoming demons to becoming WWE Champion...this was Eddie Guerrero's biggest night in his career.

WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Basham Brothers & Shanquia - This match was entertaining for me as it served it's purpose & get the crowd warmed up for the rest of the show.  There really isn't much in the forms of great tag team wrestling but it's a match that served it's purpose.

Jamie Knoble (who's wrestling blindfolded) vs. Nidia - This match had some comedic spots but for the most part was just a boring filler match to get the onscreen breakup of them over with so Nidia can move to RAW the next month.  This should have been on a PPV.

Hardcore Holly vs. Rhyno - This was another boring filler here as the match was really slow paced instead of it being a brawl which both men are best at.

APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team - This was one of APA's better tag team matches as they did some good storytelling with Hass & Benjamin working on Bradshaw's arm & him actually selling it.  Average match but it looks better than it was being in the position of the card that it was.

Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - Out of all their series of matches this year...this was the best one they had.  The crusierweight title was getting heavily pushed at this time so they were given plenty of time to go out there & tell a story in the match which worked out great & picked up the PPV with the live crowd.

Kurt Angle vs. John Cena vs. Big Show - All three men here put forth a good effort here to make this match worth wild.  Show once again came off like a dominate monster instead of ""Big Slow"" as Cena & Angle worked on his at various times showing that he was THE THREAT in the match.  Good storytelling by Cena as well as he was selling his bad knee that he got at the Rumble while Angle was in his prime during this match.  Awesome triple threat.

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Eddie Guerrero - Match of the night right here as both men clicked & put on a great mat-based wrestling match with Brock just not being able to beat Eddie no matter what he throws at him.  It's too bad Brock leaves a month later because I wanted to see a rematch between these two later on.  Eddie didn't look inferior of the Lesnar & Goldberg did interfear very quickly but it doesn't take away from the end result of Eddie winning the championship & going straight into the people to celebrate.  Eddie Guerrero finally won the big one.

(Also available on Eddie Guerrero's ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life"")

Overall, the best matches on here were the main events & the crusierweight title match as the rest of the card was either average to just plain boring.  You can pick up the Eddie/Brock match on a DVD that has more quality matches so if your interested in the triple threat & crusierweight title match...I recommend for a rental or at a cheap price.  Otherwise, I'd pass.",1181001600,,3158,4.364102564102564
2004472,5,B0001IN076,"Truly, I wasn't expecting much save for warm-up for the PPV before the legendary Wrestlemania XX, but this one on its own was spectacular when compared to the likes of Armageddon 2003 or Insurrextion 2003.  I've never been a fan of Smackdown, but this one really impressed me.

Individually, most of the matches were good, but there were some exceptions.

WWE Tag Team Championship Handicap Match
Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua
All in all, this wasn't a great match, but somehow these five managed to make it a good one.  Shaniqua involved in the match was also interesting, as WWE treats its Women's division like it wasn't there, and she actually did some wrestling and got attacked by Rikishi.  (6/10)

Jamie Noble vs Nidia
Seeing Nidia in Tough Enough really makes it hard for us to get into this gimmick of hers without a proper suspension of disbelief, but still, this match wasn't so much a match.  Jamie Noble is blindfolded, and Nidia childishly kicks his butt from behind and taunts him.  The ending was dissatisfying, but at least it was over quickly.  (1/10)

A.P.A. vs World's Greatest Tag Team
Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin are great technical wrestlers, and Faarooq and Bradshaw are just brawlers.  The way these two teams worked with one another was really impressive.  (7/10)

Hardcore Holly vs Rhyno
Virtually nothing of this match was memorable.  I can't remember anything good about this match except that it was short.  This is the sort of forgettable match you don't want to see on a pay per view, like Goldust vs Rico at Insurrextion 2003.  (0/10)

WWE Cruiserweight Championship
Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero
I read some other reviews saying this was a great match.  I think Rey Mysterio in the WWE is like a bird with his wings clipped, if not cut off altogether.  You need only to watch some of his legendary matches in ECW or AAA or WCW, versus such people as Psicosis, Dean Malenko, and Eddie Guerrero to understand his immense talent.  With WWE's watered-down booking, he's literally like a bird without wings.  Chavo isn't very good on his own either, and in the middle of the match, I literally nodded off, almost fell asleep, and came to some time later without remembering what had happened before.  A boring match.  (3/10)

#1 Contender's Match
Kurt Angle vs John Cena vs The Big Show
John Cena is a joke.  Whoever on the writing staff decided this guy was worthy of WWE championship and holding it for months on end without losing should be fired, at the very least.  Kurt Angle is an amazing athlete, and he works well with the flat dud Cena.  Even The Big Show is impressive in his own right, and seeing Angle barely pull off Olympic Slams on him is a shocking sight.  Cena was a useless addition, in my opinion, as the stars of this match were clearly Angle and Big Show.  (8/10)

WWE Championship Match
Brock Lesnar vs Eddie Guerrero
This was the highlight of the night without a doubt.  Brock Lesnar I had always thought to be a big, dumb, blank-faced thug so thickly muscled that he could barely move.  Aside from the fact that I'm totally wrong about that, he and Eddie Guerrero put on a great match that lasted over half an hour.  At first I was worried (since I knew Guerrero would win) that Lesnar was dominating Guerrero too much early on in the match, but there was another 20 minutes to go, and Guerrero really played the underdog great, and did enough damage to Lesnar to justify a victory.  The only flaw in this was that Goldberg came out and gave Lesnar a spear, potentially cheapening the victory for Guerrero, but they went on for a while longer.  Best match I've seen between these two so far.  (10/10)

I have to add the Sunday Night Heat bonus match in the extras

Tajiri, Akio, and Sakoda vs Ultimo Dragon, Paul London, and Billy Kidman
A ten out of ten match.  I can't believe this one was regulated to Sunday Night Heat and not included into the pay per view.  I haven't seen this sort of teamwork between Tajiri and his gang than in any tag team since the Hardy Boyz.  It was also the first time I've seen a triple dropkick before.  Everyone here is a cruiserweight, technical wrestler or high flyer, and it works like freaking poetry.  (10/10)

Absolutely one of the best pay per views I've seen from WWE in a while (not including WWF events).  Solid performances all around, save for a few weak links.",1179446400,,4401,4.593068035943517

1. Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua

(Tag Team Championship Handicap Match)

This was a great way to start the pay-per-view. The fact that it was a Handicap match for the tag titles made me want to watch it but the match was very solid. It was funny when Rikishi Banzai dropped Shaniqua. 8 out of 10.

2. Jamie Noble vs. Nidia (Noble must wrestle blindfolded)

This match really wasn't even a match, but you should watch it anyway because its kinda funny and it lasted about 5 minutes.

6 out of 10.

3. A.P.A. vs. The Worlds Greatest Tag Team (Tag Team Match)

This was a pretty weak match that could have definitely been better because of the two teams involved. 5 out of 10.

4. Hardcore Holly vs. Rhyno (Single Match)

What would have been better would be a hardcore match between these two but this is still a watchable match. 6 out of 10.

5. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero (WWE Cruiserweight Championship)

Now this is definitely one of the best Cruiserweight matches ever! This match had everything going for it-High-flying moves, Length,Chavo's dad getting knocked out,everything! 10 out of 10.

6. Kurt Angle vs. John Cena vs. Big Show (Triple Threat Match-Winner gets title shot at Wrestlemania 20)

This was definitely one of the best matches on the card but it had two problems that kept it from being the best. One:No Weapons and Two:Too Short. Still, its definitely a great match. 9 out of 10.

7. Brock Lesnar vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Championship Match)

This match was the best match on the card and one of the best matches I have seen at a Smackdown pay-per-view.(I'm not hating on Smackdown its just that their title matches aren't usually show-stealers). The match was kinda long(30 minutes) but that just made the match better. Everything in this match was spectacular except for the fact that Brock did have control for a lot of the match. 10 out of 10.

Match One-Handicap Match-Tag Team Championship-Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty(C) Vs The Bashams & Shaniqua-This was a nice opener except with the addition of Shaniqua it lost a little of its impact. A good length, not to long, not to short. Keep this feud going into Wrestlemania but maybe with a gimmick match to end this feud. My rating 7.9/10.

Match Two-Jamie Noble Blindfolded-Jamie Noble Vs Nidia-This feud only just got interesting after the Royal Rumble but it has been building for a few months. The time has come to put a lid and close this feud once and for all. This match wasn't as bad as most people have rated it but it wasn't the best. Then they can put Noble back in the cruiserweight division heading into Wrestlemania and hopefully give Nidia some wrestling capacities maybe on Raw. My rating 7/10.

Match Three-Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin Vs Bradshaw & Farooq- This was a nice match, they didn't announce this but it may well be the number one contenders match for Wrestlemania but i'm not sure as they have Bashams as well. Anyway this was a good match, a little to short for my liking but I still enjoyed the work shown by these men. My rating 7.70/10.

Match Four-Hardcore Holly Vs Rhyno-This match was announced on Sunday night Heat and it was basically just a straight up brawl with both men showing there brawling skills. A nice addition but nothing special. My rating 6.3/10.

Match Five-Cruiserweight Championship-Rey Mysterio(C)Vs Chavo Guerrero-Finally what most of us want to see, a long high action battle between two of the best cruiserweights. Great match, good length and good booking on the match. Hopefully something between these two at Wrestlemania and a long feud starts. My rating 8.90/10.

Match Six-Kurt Angle Vs John Cena Vs Big Show-This was a match for the number one contender spot for Wrestlemania and it wasn't the best triple threat match. It had a average ending but it was certainly what was needed for this match. Hopefully this leads to Show Vs Cena at Wrestlemania and Kurt Vs the winner of the main event. My rating 8.80/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-WWE Championship-Brock Lesnar(C)Vs Eddie Guerrero-This was an awesome match, it had high flying action,chain wrestling and strength tests. Interference by Goldberg did what it needed to. Good solid ending for this good show and match. My rating 9.54

SCOTTY 2 HOTTY & RIKISHI defeated THE BASHAM BROTHERS & SHANIQUA to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Good 8 minute opener which was better than what I was expecting. It was a decent mix of entertainment & wrestling actually. Nothing too fancy or technical, but The Bashams are coming along nicely, while the champs will suffice for at least another month or so. Match Rating...6

JAMIE NOBLE defeated NIDIA while blind-folded: Terrible... absolutely terrible. Nothing was especially funny & not too much really happened. The only positive was the result & the fact that Nidia could still actually wrestle with her... ummm, how shall I put this... extra size!!! A waste of 5 minutes & good promotional video. Match Rating...3

CHARLIE HAAS & SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated BRADSHAW & FAAROOQ: Awkward mix of styles, where there was just way too much psychology attempted for a 7 minute match. I don't think I will be the only one stating that Bradshaw & selling an injury, just don't go together in the same sentence. The worst thing about all the submission holds (which weren't actually terrible themselves), was that they resulted in nothing, and the abrupt ending could have occurred without either of the arm injuries. The WGTT still look top-notch in spurts, but this match was pretty bad. Match Rating...4

GOLDBERG / HEYMAN / LESNAR Segment: At 8 minutes in length, this was long enough to earn a segment rating in the overall 'PPV Rating'. The initial talking from Heyman was way too repetitive & pretty much rehashed what had already been said on previous television shows. But the confrontation between Goldberg & Lesnar afterwards was good, as was Heyman's carry-on during it. Segment Rating...5

HARDCORE HOLLY defeated RHYNO: Ten minute match which didn't get the crowd excited at all. I can't say I was too enthralled either. Hell, the WWE even crossed over for almost a minute of Spanish commentary during the bout!!! I still say that Holly plays the worst face character I have ever seen!!! While the bout almost defined average, there were actually a few decent moments of wrestling. But all that was undone by the terribly booked ending. After Rhyno gave Holly a huge spinebuster & then a gore, Holly crawled back in the ring & almost immediately hit his Alabama Slam for the victory. Match Rating...4

CHAVO GUERRERO JR defeated REY MYSTERIO to Win the Cruiserweight Title: Holy cow... 17 minutes given to a cruiserweight match!!! And was it worth it? Hell yeah!!! These 2 guys have to be given huge props, for not only having a great match, but also for the intensity they brought to what has only been a 3 week feud. The match was really good, and proof that when given time, even the censored WWE version of the cruiserweight division is vital to the company's success. I really liked the mix of mat & high-flying wrestling shown here. But a memo to Chavo; Leave the top-rope gutbuster to Dean Malenko, as yours looked awkward & messy. Match Rating...8

KURT ANGLE defeated JOHN CENA & THE BIG SHOW in a Triple Threat Match, to Become the #1 Contender for the WWE Championship: Really tough match to rate because it looked like it was more there for fun, rather than the importance placed on becoming #1 contender. That was partially due to the lack of unpredictability, as Angle was going to win, no matter what the result of the main event. It was actually a strangely booked & paced match (possibly due to Cena's & Show's injuries), and I struggled to get into the first 5 or 6 minutes. Following that, it was just a cavalcade of finishing moves one after the other. It almost got too ridiculous, but like I said, it was also quite fun to watch. I thought it would settle down afterwards, but then came the rather abrupt ending at the 12 minute mark. Match Rating...6

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated BROCK LESNAR to Win the WWE Championship: Superb 30 minute match. Lesnar was super impressive & really rose to the occasion, especially with his agility. While Eddie was his usual excellent self, as well as not showing any signs of discomfort against a much larger opponent. Some may not have liked the numerous submission moves used by each wrestler, but I thought they were definitely necessary, and did not slow the bout down too much. I was very much involved in the match from start to finish. Furthermore, the Goldberg interference was kept short & sweet, without effecting the outcome entirely. I also loved the terrific ending, where Eddie countered Brock's F-5 into a huge DDT & then followed it up with a frog splash. Match Rating...9

PPV RATING (45/80) = 56

Looking at the key, I have basically given the 2004 version of 'No Way Out' a 'C' grade & said that it was 'average'. Overall, I have to go along with that comment, because the undercard was just too ordinary & mediocre. But it's one of those pay-per-views that you come away from & don't mind that you have paid your money to see. While the opener & triple threat matches will be forgotten in a few months time, they were fun to watch. On top of that, the cruiserweight title match & the main event were both very good. The rest was horrendous, and should not be ignored when the WWE think about how to make a SmackDown a better overall product.",1114732800,,5768,4.7006937561942514
2004506,3,B0001IN076,"Here are my predictions for No Way Out and they are based on what has been happening on SmackDown! over the last couple of weeks.

Rey Mysterio vs. Akio in a #1 contender match for the Cruiserweight Championship.  Decent opener and Mysterio was about to hit the 619 when Kidman came in and gave him the Enzaguree followed by an Akio 450 splash for the 3.

Booker T vs. Rob Van Dam/Eddie Guerrero.  Booker got to choose who he would face he picked Van Dam because he's hurt and can't wrestle but Eddie comes down and starts taunting Booker and Booker caves in.

The Match: Eddie goes for the Frog Splash and hits it for the 3.

Cena comes to the ring and tells JBL after he beats Angle he'll beat him at WrestleMania 21.  Then the Big show comes down and tells Cena he's gonna face him and they brawl.  Angle and JBL come down and take out Show & Cena.

Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak in a 2-on-1 handicap match.  Great match back and forth.  Taker fights off Suzuki & Dupree because Dupree wanted to move on and he took Kenzo with him.  Then as Taker hits a Chokeslam on Reigns, the gongs hit.  The lights go out and then you see Taker lying in the ring.  Reigns gets the 1,2,3.  They find out who dimmed the lights later in the night.

Charlie Haas tells anybody who wants to face him, face him in the ring right away.

Charlie Haas vs. Daniel Puder.  Horrible match.  Hardcore comes out with a trash can and accidently hits Haas with it ad Puder rolls him up for the win.

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. A return of a wrestler(Dean Malenko).  Great Cruiserweight battle.  Scotty goes for the Worm misses and Dean puts him in the Texas Cloverleaf and Scotty tapped.

Basham Brothers vs. Dudley Boyz in a Tables match.  Bloody match.  Bubba gets busted open with a chair.  Danny got a reverse DDT onto a Ladder.  The Bashams retain after a Powerbomb to D-Von through a Table by JBL.

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle in a #1 contender's match for the WWE Title at WrestleMania 21.  Best Match so far.  Angle has the Anke Lock on Cena but Cena won't tap.  Cena hits an FU but angle kicks out.  Angle puts the Ankle Lock back on.  Angle turns and walks into Sweet Chin Music from HBK and Cena covers for 3.

It was Gene Snitsky who took out the Undertaker.

JBL vs. Big Show in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship.  Booo not Main Event worthy.  Show goes for a Chokeslam but JBl reverses into a Clothesline From A Hell for the 3.

The card leading up to Eddie's historic match, however, was far from exceptional.

1. WWE Tag Team Championships: Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua: A handi cap match for the tag team championships, given how slow Rikishi is with his weight problems, and the fact that Scotty's only credible trait is doing the ""Worm"", this didn't lead to anything great...or good, a mediocre match which devolves into a comedy, Shaniqua is pinned of all people rather than one of the Tag Team challengers... *

2. Blindfold Match: Jamie Noble vs Nidia: A worthless addition to the card that wraps up Nidia and Nobles' relationship, too bad this comedy match was so unintentionally crap DUD

3. Hardcore Holly vs Rhyno: Complete filler to bore the crowd after witnessing Lesnar and Goldbergs' first confrontation *

4. The Worlds' Greatest Tag Team vs The A.P.A: An early sneek peek of J.B.L's pre-championship career ""reaches new heights of excitment"" as he and Farooq battle Shelton Benjamen and Charlie Hass in a match that is purly carried by thier opponents **1/2

5. WWE Cruserweight Championship: Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero: Coming off a successful heel turn, Chavo turned his attentions towards Rey's cruserwight championship, and the results, unlike the poor cruserweight match at the Royal Rumble, was given enough time and pace to find a direction and draw in the crowd, resulting in one of the more finer cruserweight matches you will see on SMACKDOWN, PPV or otherwise, Chavo's father plays a key role in the beggining and end of this scientefic cruserweight classic which takes the belt from Mysterio ****

6. Triple Threat Number One Contenders' Match: Kurt Angle vs The Big Show vs John Cena: As short as this match is, it's pretty good, Cena's finest match of 2004 (he had a ton of mediocre and decent matches after this) Angle shines for one of the last remaining times as he makes the most of the match and carries his opponents to credible, worthwhile efforts which sets up Wrestlemania 20's main event for SMACKDOWN logically ***

7. Eddie Guerrero vs Brock Lesnar: This match lived up to every expectation, Eddie and Brock's match went a full twenty seven minutes, filled with incredible wrestling, counter moves, strategies, and slight interference from RAW'S Bill Goldberg, which leads to Guerrero capitilising on the attack in his own manner by reversing an F-5 and then frog splashing Lesnar for the win, Eddie's championship victory is a wonderful thing to behold...as his family are even at ringside to wintess the moment of Eddie's exorcism, this was also Lesnar's final great match before he humiliated himself in a pitiful match with Goldberg at Wrestlemania 20 *****",1104969600,,2941,4.95131845841785

2004524,5,B0001IN076,"Great PPV.  No Way Out 2004 has been one of the better PPV's of 2004.  Very entertaining.  Good effort by the Smackdown brand.

1. Basham Brothers & Shaniqua vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (WWE Tag Titles)

These two teams, minus Shaniqua, wrestled some pretty good matches on Smackdown.  This was not the best match.  Somewhat entertaining.  (7/10)

2. Jamie Noble vs. Nidia (Blinfold Match)

They finally brought and end to the Nidia being blind saga.  Kind of funny.  (6.5/10)

3. APA vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team

This was at a point when Haas and Benjamin were never on the show, but they deserved to be.  Nothing really happens.  (6.5/10)

4. Brock Lesnar/Goldberg Confrontation

Lesnar comes out and talks trash about Goldberg.  Goldberg comes out and Jackhammers Lesnar.  Sick Jackhammer and good confrontation.  (8/10)

5. Hardcore Holly vs. Rhyno

This match was thrown together at the last second.  They developed good beef on Smackdown, but this match wasn't that great.  Why not make it a Hardcore match?  (7/10)

6. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero (Cruiserweight Title)

Great match.  I think it was the best match on the PPV and one of the best so far this year.  Great match.  Everything was mixed into one in this match.  Technical, high-flying, close falls.  Great match.  (9/10)

7. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show (#1 Contender Match WWE Title at Wrestlemania 20)

Good match.  Very mixed styles, but these three worked well together and put on a pretty good match.  Kind of slow paced, but very entertaing.  Good match.  (8.5/10)

8. Brock Lesnar vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title)

Great match.  Again, kind of slow, but very entertaining match.  It was a classic technical match, with many near falls.  Goldberg makes an appearance.  Great match.  One of the better one's of the year.  (9/10)

Good PPV.  Very entertaing.  Definately pick it up.  It is well worth it, especially for the Cruiserweight Title, WWE Title, and #1 Contender's Match)

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
Brock Lesnar  VS.  Eddie Guerrero
TRIPLE-THREAT MATCH
Winner is the #1 Contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XX!
Kurt Angle  VS.  John Cena  VS.  Big Show
WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
Rey Mysterio with Jorge Paez  VS.  Chavo Guerrero with Chavo Guerrero Sr.

WWE TAG TEAM TITLE HANDICAP MATCH
Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty  VS.  Basham Brothers & Shaniqua
Hardcore Holly  VS.  Rhyno
APA  VS.  The World's Greatest Tag Team
SIX MAN TAG TEAM MATCH (from Sunday Night Heat)
Ultimo Dragon, Paul London & Billy Kidman  VS.  Tajiri, Akio & Sakoda
The best matches of the night have to be the WWE Championship match between the WWE Champion, Brock Lesnar, and Latino Heat, Eddie Guerrero... the Triple-Threat match to determine the No. 1 Contender for the WWE Championship... and the APA going up against ""The World's Greatest Tag-Team"" - The WWE Cruiserweight Championship match is great too come to think of it. There were a few rather pointless card-fillers such as Hardcore Holly VS. Rhyno & Nidia against Jamie Noble in the blindfold match, but the other matches do make up for this.
When Eddie wins the WWE Championship, it's a very special & emotional moment.
All in all a great event and a brilliant DVD! Extra's include; Action & interviews from Sunday Night Heat, Rey Mysterio's music video, ""Crossing Borders""... and MORE!
I would highly recommend this great event to any avid WWE fan to add to their collection. 5/5 stars, get it!!",1086652800,,1675,4.858657243816254
2004557,3,B0001IN076,"First of all let me say this ppv should have been Raw and Smackdown because it was the last one before WM 20 but the show was still okay.
Rikishi/Scotty 2 Hotty vs Basham bros and Shaniqua-Pretty good opener. It was entertaining watching what Shaniqua did when she had to fight and it was just like I thought RUN!!!!. Having her was a disadvantage for the Bashams seem she got pinned after the Bonanza Drop. 7/10 10 minutes
Jamie Noble (Blindfolded) vs Nidia-Was very funny but wasn't really a match. It was too short and it would have helped the match if Nidia had won. Jamie Noble cheats to win by lifting his blindfold up and using his submission move. 5/10 3 minutes
APA vs WGTT-BORING!!!!!. I am a big fan of Benjamin and Haas but the APA are old brawlers that are boring to watch. It wasn't WGTT fault this was a bad match. The match had no build up and was absoulute donkey crap. 2/10 8 minutes
Rhyno vs Hardcore Holly-This match was alot better than I thought. These two under rated wrestlers put on a great show and a very physically intense battle. Hardcore Holly won so suddenly with the Alabama slam but Rhyno deserved to win. If the match was 5 minutes longer it would have been better. 8/10 9 minutes
Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero-Best cruiserweight match on a ppv so far. Very rarely do you see cruiserweights get 15 minutes in the ring. It wasn't the most high flying match but it still had outstanding action. I can't beleive Mysterio lost his title he deserves to wear it all year. 9/10 14 minutes
Angle vs Big Show vs John Cena-I thought this match would be great but it wasn't very good. Most of the action was slow and boring and it was predictable who would win. I would expect better from Kurt and Cena but Big Show is always a boring wrestler to watch. Was also too short. 6/10 12 minutes
Eddie Guerrero vs Brock Lesnar-Absoulutly brilliant match. I never expected this match to be great but it turned out to be a long, tough, bruising match for both men. It was 32 minutes long but never got boring. I loved the end when Guerrero ddt'd Lesnar on the belt and finished him off with a frog splash. The crowd errupted when Eddie covered Brock and the celebration was great. 10/10 32 minutes
Overall no way out is a must buy for the following matches
  Rhyno vs Hardcore Holly
  Too cool vs Bashams
  Mysterio vs Chavo
  Eddie vs Lesnar",1086220800,,2354,4.407834101382488

A waste of time, but entertaining some what though. 3/10
APA Vs TSPWGTT
Haas & Benjamin the talent they very are couldn't really pull a great match out of the APA, Bradshaw and Faarooq are just so stale they need to retirean ok match though by any means.
5/10
Hardcore Holly VS Ryhno.
Hardcore ass shouldn't be wrestling at a PPV he sucks, a match that should of been on heat. 3/10
Rey Mysterio Vs Chavo Guerreo (W Chavo. Sr)
What A match!!, this is why the cruiserwieghts are my favorite, we have a high flyer in REY and a mat based style wrestle in Chavito these two put on a great match up, one of the best on the card, fast paced action all through the match.
But the ending spoiled it, even though i was rooting for Chavo one of the top heels on smackdown.
9/10.
Kurt Angle Vs The Big Show Vs John Cena.
Very good match, Big Show dominated most of the match up here.
The Doctor of Thuganomics Cena got little offensive in.
But Kurt Angle Grapped the win to be the #1 contender for the WWE title at WMXX.
What can i say the best man one. 8/10.
Latino Heat ''Eddie Guerrero'' Vs Brock Lesnar..
What a main event this turned out to be a great contest with both wrestlers having there moments in the match back and forth action.
But with a little help from Goldberg, Eddie managed to win the BIG one that being the WWE championship which he deserved after years of working his ass off. 9/10",1085011200,,1936,4.235135135135135
2004559,5,B0001IN076,"What began as an average WWE PPV ended as a magical evening! The extras aren't much other than promos for the main matches and Eddie Gurrerro's after-party.
Now to the card:
Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi Vs. The Basham Bros. & Shaniqua (WWE Tag Team Championship) - Not much of a match though the ending made me squirm, seeing Rikishi do the Banzi drop on Shaniqua! 3/10 for the match.
The World's Greatest Tag Team Vs. APA - This match was surprisingly dominated by TWGTT. Not a great match but at least the right team won. 4/10 for the match up.
Nidia Vs. Jamie Noble (Noble is blindfolded) - This one wasn't much. Noble ends up cheating to win. 1/10 for the match but 7/10 for the comedy of it!
The Goldberg/Brock Lesner face off! Frankly speaking, this face off was better than their match at WrestleMania! The emotional energy to this face off is what their match should've been!
Rey Mysterio Vs. Chavo Gurrerro, Jr. (with Chavo, Sr.) - Actually a great match. Both Gurrerro's are really becoming stars in the WWE. Chavo makes a great heel along with his father.
8/10 for the match!
Kurt Angle Vs. John Cena Vs. The Big Show (#1 contenders bout for the WWE title at WrestleMania) - Great contest. The best I've seen The Big Show in years! Even though he lost to Kurt Angle when Angle slapped the anklelock on Cena, he pretty much dominated most of this match! Great efforts by Angle and Cena too!
Eddie Gurrerro Vs. Brock Lesner (WWE Championship) - This was a great contest all the way through! The power of Brock Vs. the speed and experience of Gurrerro with a little Goldberg thrown in at the end (paying back Brock for costing him The Rumble match back in January). Watching Guerrero celebrate at the end was very emotional. More emotional in my view than the celebration with Chris Benoit at WrestleMania!

2004581,4,B0001IN076,"a good effort for smackdown to kick off 2004. no way out has its ups & downs. dvd extras are good. great idea to have goldberg as a front row spectator. another great spot was the sound of the gong & footage of the undertaker as the dead man. he returns in 28 days at wrestlemania 20. their is a great spot between brock lesnar, paul heyman & goldberg. the strangest part was at the beginning when sable & torrie wilson came out together. it seemed to be a time killer to give fans a chance to arrive. the arena was half empty during sunday night heat. weird.
TAJIRI, AKIO, & SAKODA VS BILLY KIDMAN, PAUL LONDON & ULTIMO DRAGON 8/10- excellent match on sunday night heat. best heat match ever! should have been on the ppv. these guys are exciting.

JAMIE NOBLE VS NIDIA(NOBLE MUST WRESTLE BLINDFOLDED) 5/10- not a great match but was entertaining. usually blindfold matches are horrible but this one was a little interesting.
THE WORLD'S GREATEST TAG TEAM VS APA 7/10- good concept. the wrestlers vs the brawlers. was too short. should have been longer. glad to see faroque return. action filled.
RHYNO VS HARDCORE HOLLY 3/10- not a gorefest but a BOREfest! worst match of the night. crowd was dead & almost put me to sleep. dumb idea to put the 2 worst guys on smackdown together. should have been on heat.

NO WAY OUT 2004

Man I miss Eddie so much and watching this night brings back so many great memories. This event was a good one and after re-watching it I liked it even more. This was also a time when Smackdown really had the best talent they may have ever had.

1.[TAG TITLES]RIKISHI & SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS BASHAM BROTHERS & SHANQUIA-this was a good opening match with good fun action. The crowd was into this one which helped it out with both teams doing well here. The champs retain here as the team of the Basham Brothers and Shanquia just couldn't handle the Too Cool teammates.

2.[BLINDFOLD MATCH]JAMIE NOBLE VS NIDIA-this was the match that ended their relationship as they had been together for a while storyline wise. In this match Jamie had a hood on his head and could not see. This was basically an entertainment match not a wrestling one. For what it was it was good, funny and such. Noble wins this one.

3. APA VS WORLDS GREATEST TAG TEAM-I really enjoyed this match I miss all four of these guys being active wrestlers in the WWE. Great action right here with the mix of styles with some near falls. The WGTT end up wining this one in a close contest that was back and forth.

Right here Goldberg enters the arena and takes his seat at ringside. This prompts Paul Heyman to come out followed by Brock Lesnar. Naturally a fight breaks out and Goldberg is arrested.

4. HARDCORE HOLLY VS RHYNO-another match that I really enjoyed more so than most. I am a big fan of both of these guys and their styles. Good hard hitting action in this one with both guys going at it. Holly ends up winning this one but this was better than most give it credit for.

5.[CRUSIERWEIGHT TITLE]REY MYSTERIO VS CHAVO GUERRERO-this was an excellent match right here as these two always delivered. The action is back and forth and fast paced with Chavo coming out on top and winning the title. This is one of the best matches on the card and probably the best.

6. KURT ANGLE VS JOHN CENA VS THE BIG SHOW-excellent match right here with three guys that go all out. Big Show is the unstoppable big man that the other two have to double team while Cena was in full swing doing his hip hop thing. Angle of course is one of the greatest of all time so this match was great. All three men have time to shine with multiple times anyone of them could have won it. In the end Kurt locks in that ankle lock and Cena taps out. Angle goes on to Wrestlemania to face the WWE champion.

7.[WWE TITLE]BROCK LESNAR VS EDDIE GUERRERO-this right here might be the best match of the night and might be my favorite as well. I have always been an Eddie fan even before he was in ECW so when this night came I was all about him winning. Eddie and Brock have a great match here and looking back it is a shame that they never got a chance for more matches and a feud. Brock of course is the beast with all the power while Eddie uses his speed and tactics to go at Lesnar. Sure Goldberg spears Brock but this match was all about Eddie. When he wins the title and goes into the crowd it is wonderful, great match.

BONUS

1. ULTIMO DRAGON, PAUL LONDON & BILLY KIDMAN VS TAJIRI, AKIO & SAKODA-this match was on Sunday Night Heat before the PPV and was full of great talent. Dragon is one of my all time favorites along with Tajiri but everyone here is great. With the talent in this match it could have easily been on the PPV. This match is full of great fast paced action with Tajiri and Dragon really shining here especially when in against each other. Plus London takes a big bump going to the outside as Tajiri gets the pin over Ultimo.

This was a much better event then I remember it being but of course Eddie winning will always be classic.

For special features we get promos for matches as well as interviews and the great exchange between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero from Smackdown when Eddie won the Smackdown mini Royal Rumble to earn his shot at Brock. Then of course Rey Mysterios music  video and the making of said video, plus Eddie's post match celebration.",1409702400,,4043,4.323645970937913
