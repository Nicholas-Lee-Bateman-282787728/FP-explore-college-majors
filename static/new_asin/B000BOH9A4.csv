8090220,3,B000BOH9A4,"In ""Mi Madre Es Culpable,"" Marga L&oacute;pez plays an Atheist who has to make a very difficult decision about a small son suffering from cancer. In ""Un Divorcio,"" she again plays a non-believer who gets a divorce from her first husband and then marries another non-believer (played by Carlos Lopez Monctezuma) who at the same time is a man of infinite patience and kindness. As the years go by, she converts to Catholism and spends the rest of the film trying to convince her husband to do the same. The enjoyment of the film will depend on your take on such issues: the character played by Monctezuma is such a ""perfect"" husband, does he really need to convert to make him acceptable to a woman who had been a non-believer herself? Like a lot of converts, she seems now intractable in her attitudes. If you are a devoted follower you will see no problem with the wife's fanaticism, but if you're aware of the Church's spotty history of power and political meddling, and the more recent issues dealing with pedophilia, and the institution's inability to deal honestly with them, you may be turned off by the Lopez part. Should you only accept love from people of your own faith, or should you accept them as they are, leave them alone and take care of your own religious beliefs? Needless to say, the husband converts at the end, those being more naive times. Nevertheless, it is still admirable that the Mexican cinema was dealing with such issues at a time when neither Hollywood nor Europe would have dared approach such controversial themes. Marga L&oacute;pez does her usual professional turn in a dicey part, and Carlos L&oacute;pez Monctezuma, usually cast in villain parts, acquits himself splendidly as a very accomodating husband. The print is quite good and the film will hold your interest, particularly if you're a fan of Marga L&oacute;pez.",1309824000,2,1855,4.818181818181818
