3871326,5,B00280W8SW,Excellent quality and content. Rudy has made his commentary relevant and interesting. Truly is the Best of Europe. Product arrived promptly and as advertised. Good value for money!,1316908800,2,180,5.464285714285714
3871327,4,B00280W8SW,I VIEWED THE BEST OF EUROPE WITH A RELAXATION AND THE ONLY FLAW WAS VIEWING THE DISFUNCTIONAL MODERN ART AND ARCHITECTURE LAME AND HANDICAPPED HUMAN ENDEVOUR.  THE BACK STREETS IS A REAL AND TIGHT SOCIAL IDENTITY COMPARED TO TOURIST SCAMS OF SITE AFTER SITE: YET YES THE DVDS ARE RUSHING AROUND TOO>>WHEREAS THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO SEE WHAT WE HOPED TO SEE AND ENJOY>>THIS IS STILL ENJOYABLE.,1297468800,2,400,4.797101449275362
3871328,5,B00280W8SW,I bought this item as a birthday gift for my niece. She enjoys travel videos and really liked this. The variety of places visited is good and the segments are not so long that they get boring. I would recommend this item for anyone who enjoys travel.,1287878400,5,250,4.340425531914893
3871329,1,B00280W8SW,Rudy is a shameless drunk. He ruined all videos by showing alcohol freely flowing a thousand times. To him Europe revolves around drunk people. What a waste of money and time. I want my money back. His efforts to self promote himself and his daughter are shameless acts and at my cost. Stay away as there is more alcohol in these videos than you may have ever seen.,1276992000,3,365,4.382352941176471
3871330,5,B00280W8SW,"Amazing scenery and commentary. Makes me want to go - over and over again. Very reasonable cost and, of course, Amazon quality.",1271203200,9,127,4.818181818181818
3871331,4,B00280W8SW,"This is a great DVD Set but is missing Greece & Spain! I recommend the more complete set: ""Rudy Maxa: Europe To the Max - Return Trip"" (which has Spain & Greece but omits Italy) or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009"" which covers everything and is 13 DVD's long! When comparing Maxa to Steves, Maxa shoots better video, is less nerdy, has better music, better visuals, but Steves' is way more in depth with historical references and analysis of the region. Some people may get bored with Steves' in depth coverage though so for those, Maxa would be a better choice.
Contents of this DVD Set is exactly the same as ""Europe to the Max with Rudy Maxa"" so if you can get this one cheaper than go for this one & then see if you can get Greece & Spain Rudy Maxa footage separately off amazon!

3871332,5,B00280W8SW,I bought this series for my Mom because she has never been to Europe and wanted to travel there via DVD. I recently borrowed them for my upcoming trip to Italy. The Italy DVD's were awesome and gave me great ideas and pretty much planned my itenarary. But I kept watching the other DVD's and now looking forward to planning other trips.,1264982400,20,336,4.435483870967742
3871333,2,B00280W8SW,Got this set of DVDs as seemed to be good value. Viewed the France DVD and was disappointed. Rudy Maxa is superficial in his comments and the travelogue is short and dated (made in 2002). Rick Steves is streets ahead,1264723200,7,216,4.425

3871336,5,B00280W8SW,"I got this video on DVD.  it shows some interesting places in Europe.  one of the better current videos on Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, as well as a few other places.  get this while you can,as some of the PBS videos can get hard to find in a short time.",1403568000,6,254,4.04
3871337,4,B00280W8SW,"Rudy Maxa does a lot of research to share with his viewers about the places he visits. I also admire the photographic quality of the dvd's, better than most travel videos. Would recommend this set for its quality and value.",1402099200,5,223,4.6
3871338,5,B00280W8SW,This was a present for someone else but I did look at one of the DVDs and it had a good summary of places to see and visuals were good.,1401321600,2,135,3.533333333333333
3871339,2,B00280W8SW,"In  between restaurant advertisements, markets,  beer and wine blogs, that is.  If you can get through the paid commercial plugs with these things you do actually see some history and culture, but don't expect too much. I haven't timed it exactly but my best guess is that it runs about 60/40 in favor of winery and restaurant plugs from Rudy. Nice Guy, interesting, and could have been really good but as usual greed wins out.",1400716800,3,427,4.666666666666667
3871340,5,B00280W8SW,"Bought at son's request. Great overview of the countries .Will help in geography!  Autistic son watches over and over! Great for him. Broadens his interests, Keeps him away from the video games!",1395532800,5,194,5.0625
3871341,5,B00280W8SW,Ordered this for my brother who is battling cancer.  He and his wife absolutely love this and rewatch it frequently.,1383177600,2,116,4.8
3871342,5,B00280W8SW,"Rudy Maxa is a wonderful narrator.  His travel programs cover just the right amount of a destination's history, modern culture, wine tasting, and foods.  I first discovered his programs on the ""Create"" channel and enjoy them every time they are aired.  Starting with this set, I finally decided to start a collection of his DVDs.",1370822400,6,329,4.945454545454545
3871343,5,B00280W8SW,"The information is pretty standard from what I saw and personal as well, Rudy Maxa acting almost like a personal tour guide through Europe.

I'm really leaving this review because of Questar, the distribution company, we had problems with one of the discs and the company treated us very well. I recommend this product on that basis. And would feel pretty safe in buying Questar distributed products in the future.",1331596800,7,414,4.914285714285715
8355383,5,B00280W8SW,"although Rudy Maxa goes to the most expensive restaurants and hotels most of us cannot ever afford, he gives everyone a sneak peak on what is out there to enjoy. His series is very dated, but it's still lots of fun watching him travel, taking us all along.",1505001600,,256,4.354166666666667
8355384,5,B00280W8SW,Excellent product,1497657600,,17,8.0
8355385,5,B00280W8SW,"Rudy Maxa is always entertaining and being a history and French teacher, I find these videos a great addition to my class. I think being able to see the places we're talking about helps the kids internalize the information a little more. I can't speak for buying it just for the travel sake, but for a classroom setting, I've used several of them.",1494633600,,347,4.523809523809524
8355386,5,B00280W8SW,Rudy seems to enjoy the locale and people with less aggressive pace...I like it.,1485043200,,80,4.785714285714286
