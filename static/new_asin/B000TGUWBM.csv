8209378,3,B000TGUWBM,"""Far Out Space Nuts"" is one of the few remaining Sid and Marty Kroft shows that hasn't made it out to DVD yet.  Hopefully, in the years ahead that will be rectified by whoever currently owns the rights. Overall, FOSN is a far sillier program than its contemporary, Land of the Lost which at least tried to take the scif aspect of it, rather seriously. Not so, for this program.

The program pretty much is a set up for Bob Denver's Gilligan like antics with Chuck McCann playing the straight man as each week, the two encounter a different alien race for adventures and comedy.  When it comes to special effects, the show is a mixed bag with some fairly decent special effects (like the somewhat Apollo 11 lunar model like space ship) alternating with matte screen shots and really cheesy looking aliens.

If you like Gilligan's Island, if you like screwball comedy, than you'll probably enjoy Far Out Space Nuts, and it does deserve to be out on DVD.

8209379,5,B000TGUWBM,"My review is going to be pretty simple.  I have looked for other titles at Amazon and they don't even say ""Sign up to be notified when this becomes available"", but now seeing as how this one does...maybe they are hinting towards knowing that it's ""on the way"".

Sid & Marty Krofft have released the following (unless there are more I am not aware of):

Land of the Lost (Seasons 1 - 3)
Sigmund & The Sea Monster (Season 1 only...so far)
Lidsville (Complete Series)
The Bugaloos (Complete Series)
H.R. Pufnstuf (Complete Series, and a Movie)

So why not The Far Out Space Nuts, and I agree with the reviewer that mentioned The Lost Saucer.  Hopefully they will all be released someday.",1251158400,7,684,4.573770491803279
8209380,5,B000TGUWBM,"I too am waiting for this release. I am also waiting for ""The lost Saucer"" to be made availble. I have the complete series of Land of the lost, Sigmond and the Bugaloos. I Want Spacenuts and The Lost Saucer.. I do not care for the talking flute or the hats..(they scare me)But still glad to see they are all making a comeback!  And with all these seasons.. I have Enough to Watch. Still loved The Lost Saucer and Far Out Space Nuts. Try finding a ""Honk "" Doll.. Impossible..",1243814400,5,474,4.266666666666667
