8078783,3,B000AL8VL4,"My wife and I like the Pond videos even better than our two small boys (who still like them).  This one was cute and funny as usual, but not as good as the othe Pond videos.  The big mouth bass was really mean and obnoxious which confused my 2 and 4 yr old boys.  After she learned her lesson, they didn't seem to emphasize the lesson enough.  Also, this video has only this one story compared to other Pond videos with two stories.  We were really disappointed in that.",1408665600,,470,4.235955056179775
