3118753,5,B0013OOIU0,Wonderful movie for families to watch together. It is a older Disney movie with Walt Disney introducing the film himself. Very entertaining. Great for dog lovers of all ages!,1366156800,,174,5.0344827586206895

3118755,5,B0013OOIU0,This story is wonderfully told.  I love the perspective and understanding of the story - does anyone know any more movies like this?!,1339027200,,133,4.782608695652174
3118756,1,B0013OOIU0,"This movie is an excellent time capsule to remind yourself just how much our attitude towards pets has changed since the simpler 1950s and 60s. What passes as harmless hijinx would be considered negligence and animal abuse today.

Strike One: The family takes the dog on a road trip over the river and through the woods to Grandpa's house. En route, they pull off in the middle of the forest and let the dog run loose into the woods with no collar, no leash. Of course the dog gets lost in the woods, and when it starts to rain, THEY JUST LEAVE THE DOG, intending to come back for it later when it stops raining.

Strike Two: The little lost dog ends up wandering over to Grandpa's house on his own days later. Grandpa (unaware the dog belongs to his irresponsible family and thinking he's just a stray) takes him in, treats him nice, gives him a good life. Happy ending, right? Nope. A year later, the idiot family returns to visit Grandpa, sees that he has the pup they abandoned in the forest, AND TAKES HIM AWAY FROM GRANDPA. Are you ready to start smacking this family around yet?

Strike Three: As if robbing Grandpa of his beloved pet (and the pup of his loving home) wasn't bad enough, on the way back home from Grandpa's house, they stop for gas, and guess what---THEY LET THE DOG GET LOOSE AGAIN. Yes, after reuniting with him out of pure dumb luck a year after losing him the first time, they go and lose him again that same day.

Three strikes, yer out! All of this makes for a very frustrating movie to sit through, and though it might teach children the importance of being responsible with your pet (getting him a collar with ID tags, keeping him on a leash, etc.) the fact that the film itself never suggests the idiot family is doing anything wrong or out of the ordinary sends the wrong message.",1315267200,11,1813,4.402985074626866
3118757,5,B0013OOIU0,"Had to pay a pretty penny to get this 49 minute movie on DVD. But I'm very happy to have it in my library. I fondly remember as a child watching these mini classics and this underrated title masterfully defines everything The Wonderful World of Disney was putting out way back when.
A young little Corgi (a very special and yet somewhat comical breed of dog) who becomes seperated from his owners is forced to grow up and fend for himself in a brutal rural setting. There's danger or tragedy around every bush for this little guy, but in true WWD fashion, it all works out well in the end for this extremely endearing pup.",1299974400,3,622,4.417391304347826
3118758,5,B0013OOIU0,"OK many have not thought much of this Wonderful World of Disney episode but I think it is so cute and charming and well worth having as part of any Disney collection. At merely some 49 minutes, don't let that put you off - remember this is an episode from the TV series Wonderful World of Disney but as far as I can recall it is complete.

The DVD reproduction could have been a little better - I have remarked on this on many other Disney Movie Club releases. We must remember these releases were meant for a limited few and not general DVD release - though it staggers the imagination as to why. Honestly, I cannot understand the current Disney philosophy in regards to general DVD releases - especially with everyone eager for Disney to release more of their Disneyland & Wonderful World of Disney television series'.

I love any movie about dogs and how they find themselves in all sorts of adventures after a particular mis-adventure and only Disney has the knack of telling such tales. A delightful Disney classic!",1272672000,,1020,4.5989010989010985
3118759,5,B0013OOIU0,"It's been a long time since I watched this movie on TV.  I do remember thinking that it followed the book very closely- ""Hurry home Candy"" by DeJong.  This DVD will be a movie I treasure.",1225497600,4,187,4.166666666666667
3118760,5,B0013OOIU0,"THE STORY: This is a very enjoyable made for television live action movie. It is the story of a Welsh Corgi puppy named ""Candy"", a family adopts one day and she fast becomes friends with their two smll children, Bud and Katy. One day Candy has a run in with a broom, that leaves her with a fear of brooms that is overwhelming. Candy gets lost one day on a fmaily outing and befriends a woman when he helps her. Later he befriends a retired farmer, and sets forth some unusual but heart warming coincidences. Meanwhile his family continues to search for him.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: Winston Hibler not only produced this film for Walt Disney but he narrated the story. Hibler narrated many of the True-Life Adventures. He also worked in the animation department, and produced some Disney live action projects including the movie ""Perri"". Screenplay by Catherine Turney, based on the book, ""Hurry Home Candy"", by Meindert de Jong. Directed by Walter Perkins. The show first aired on the Wonderful World of Color on NBC on January 13, 1963 as episode number 223, and this was the shows 9th season. Ther episode was popular enough to re-air on September 1 of that same year, August 17, '69, and one last time on June 6, 1976. It was not released to VHS and this DVD is the first release to the public in 30 years. It is in full screen, and that is the way it was originally filmed, being made for television. Likewise the sound is mono. Very fun, simply made on a tight budget, great family film about a family and their Corgi dog.",1213401600,14,1532,4.491039426523297
