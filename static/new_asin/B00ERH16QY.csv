8608709,1,B00ERH16QY,"If you like Kenny Rogers you will wonder why this DVD is loaded with songs you never heard ofand is called Golden Hits Collection.  And where are the hits???  Terrible, Terrible video.  Poor audio.  Made my 80 inch 4K TV and $20,000 sound system cry.  I will never play it again.",1413417600,2,279,4.392156862745098

8608711,5,B00ERH16QY,Kenny Rogers is one of the great singers of our time. You can always depend on him to belt a great song.,1394150400,,104,3.772727272727273
8608712,4,B00ERH16QY,"Kenny Rogers is an interesting vocal stylist and here we get the chance to hear how he has evolved his unique style from the years in the First Edition. Here are interesting and good takes on covers like Bridge over troubled water and She thinks I still care to his original versions of his own There's an old man in our town and Alex Harvey's King of Oak Street. One of the best songs here is Lady play your symphony, a ballad typicallly suited for Kenny's raspy vocals.

The sound is OK, but not great.

For serious fans of Kenny or fans of the First Edition, this should be a MUST-HAVE!",1387411200,,589,4.297297297297297
