2023286,4,B0001OGV26,"MAN IN THE ATTIC (directed by Hugo Fregonese, based on a novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes). In gas-lit London at the turn of the century, the district of Whitechapel is being terrorised by a series of grisly murders involving prostitutes and actresses. Slade (Jack Palance) seems to fit the description of the murderer and lives a mysterious life as lodger in the house belonging to Mr and Mrs Harley (Rhys Williams and Frances ""Aunt Bea"" Bavier). When the Harleys' showgirl niece Lily Bonner (Constance Smith) comes to stay, Slade's behaviour grows more erratic...and the body-count in Whitechapel rises steadily.

Produced by Panoramic Productions, MAN IN THE ATTIC was a virtual scene-for-scene remake of an earlier Fox movie, ""The Lodger"" (made in 1944, starring Laird Cregar and Merle Oberon). Jack Palance is perfectly cast as the moody, mysterious stranger who may or may not be Jack The Ripper. The Whitechapel murder mystery (and the identity of the person/s who committed them) has never been completely solved. MAN IN THE ATTIC tries to answer the mystery.

This movie is also available in the MGM Midnite Movies series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blueprint-For-Murder-Man-In-the-Attic/dp/B000RXVND8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blueprint For Murder / Man In the Attic</a>); it's probably a better deal for classic movie collectors.  ""Blueprint for Murder"" is a fantastic ""mini noir"" with Jean Peters and Joseph Cotten, and really more fun than it should be.",1291680000,,1507,5.629955947136564

While a bevy of cuties gaily warbled ""You're in Love"" and sashayed their stuff on screen, cash registers at theater refreshment counters all over America probably rang with equal gaiety. And there's two more such interruptions later on.

The story opens with promise: a nicely executed foggy night scene where a reeling floozy is snuffed almost in sight of two ""crushers"" who patrol eerily vacant Whitechapel streets. Next, Mr. Slade (Jack Palance), a self-proclaimed pathologist, rents two rooms and a chazerai-cluttered attic from Helen Harley (Frances Bavier) and her husband William (Rhys Williams). Shades of previous ""Lodger"" films when Slade objects to wall art; the eyes of ladies depicted ""follow"" him, you see.

The Harleys' niece, Lily Bonner (Constance Smith) is introduced immediately after, as is a time-padding popcorn-pushing stage number.

Palance nicely underplays his role of the suspected Ripper, adding just a smidgen of neurosis.

2023291,3,B0001OGV26,"THE MAN IN THE ATTIC was the fourth film based on Marie Belloc-Lowndes' 1912 novel ""The Lodger,"" a fictionalized account of Jack the Ripper.  Alfred Hitchcock filmed it first as a silent and years later as a sound film, and English director Maurice Elvey surveyed it once in 1932.

  This 1953 version, by Argentinean director Hugo Fregonese, is pure Hollywood hokum.  The actors, who are supposed to be Victorian Londoners, sound more East St. Louis than East Side.  The murders bear only the most superficial similarities to Ripper murders.  In other words, the two that occur during film time occur in Whitechapel and the victims are women.  Worst (if you're into historical accuracy), or best (if you're into entertainment value), are the two musical production numbers, which are pure 50's-era Hollywood schmaltz. The songs, ""You're in Love"" and ""The Parisian Trot,"" were written by musical director Lionel Newman, whose score adds its weight in gold to the tense atmosphere.

  Jack Palance stars as the mysterious young man who arrives late one night to rent rooms from an eccentric older couple.  Palance plays Slade, a young pathologist who craves solitude, comes and goes at the oddest hours, and generally behaves in a manner that has everyone wondering where he was when the latest Whitechapel murder occurred.  With his high, bony cheekbones and narrow, deep set eyes underneath a brooding brow the young Palance is able to convey sinister menace without softly hissing a line of dialogue.  It's a good thing, too, considering the fluff he's surrounded with.  The prettiest fluff sticks to young Constance Smith, a transcendentally nave young woman, the daughter of Slade's landlord and a music hall star who at one point through a continental bump and grind at Prince Albert.

  THE MAN IN THE ATTIC is too silly to be much of a thriller, although it does have its moments of high tension.",1092441600,5,1903,4.987301587301587

2023294,4,B0001OGV26,"I have to thank Amazon for making these black and white classic films available via streaming as otherwise, I would probably not have viewed them. MAN IN THE ATTIC is a 1953 film that takes a unique perspective of the Ripper killings and is one of the rare films that focuses on the Ripper as a tormented, psychologically scarred being and not the brutal fiend portrayed in other films.

Jack Palance provides a credible performance as the mysterious lodger who takes up residence in the attic of his landlady, played to perfection by Frances Bavier (Aunt Bee from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW). Bavier is excellent as the suspicious landlady who thinks her lodger might be Jack the Ripper and who is not amused when her lovely niece (played by the beautiful Constance Smith) is taken with the new lodger. Then theres Rhys Williams, who plays Ms. Smiths father in the film. The strength of this film lies in the wonderful performances by the ensemble cast and the story makes sense because of the credible performances.

A side note: Constance Smith, lovely and talented as she appeared in this film, led a tragic life (I am always curious as to how some of these movie stars fared in real life). I was hoping to see if she had been in more films (1954's IMPULSE), but my research revealed she had so many problems in her personal and professional life, she eventually faded into obscurity, never realizing her full talents. This discovery somehow enhanced my appreciation of this film even more  for Ms. Smith does shine in this role and proves she is a good character actress.

2023321,5,B0001OGV26,"It's Victorian London and the public is fear stricken over the brutal murders of women by an unknown assailant, Jack the Ripper. Right when the police are asunder searching the night streets, desperate for a lead after several gruesome murders, a mysterious man named Mr. Slade appears at the home of a middle aged couple and their beautiful singer/dancer of a daughter and immediately asks to rent a room.

 He says his late inquiry is due to the nature of his occupation as a pathologist, which requires him to experiment late into night, where it is quiet. She shows him the available lodgings, but once she tells him they have an attic, he demands she rent it to him so he can work in private. Shortly after he takes residence, he arouses the family's suspicion by creeping around the house late into the night.

The first alarm is when they smell something burning from the attic, and find out he was burning a black bag. The police recently learned that the Ripper was seen carrying a black bag, for his knives. Suspicious as this is, the husband waves it off as not destroying evidence but not wanting to be confused as the ripper. In fact that day a man was harassed in the street just for having a black bag. The husband in fact hid his black bag in a chest under some blankets.

Other suspicious events serve to further alarm not only his neighbors, but also the police. In front of a public investigator, he criticizes their attempts to capture the Ripper, saying the Ripper is not a criminal, neither is anybody, but just a product of circumstance with a mission to accomplish. He also claims they will never find him.  During the night of another slaying, we see him wash his hands in the canal before entering home late upsetting the family dog, who starts to growl in his presence. They find him burning his blood stained clothes in the stove, which he claims are from an experiment with blood and disease and his highly contagious.

During his stay he becomes enamored with their beautiful daughter Lily Bonner. Unlike her parents, she believes his unusual nature is due to his being alone and just needs someone to care for. With her, Slade confides key aspects of his past like his tormented relationships with his deceased parents as well as where as where he works, the laboratory at the local university. She even lets him walk her to the theatre and later invites him to her performance.

Taking her offer, he attends her performance but becomes uncomfortable at how she uses her talent and beauty to manipulate men, much as his mother did to his father, cheating on him with several men before leaving him to drink to death. After the show, he confronts her in her dressing room, begging her to run away with him from her ""decadent"" life pleasing other men. She refuses and he pulls a knife on her. Meanwhile, while searching the attic, the police discover a picture of his mother and realize that she was the first victim of Jack the Ripper. They barge into the dressing room right when he climbs out the window. A chase on horsebuggy ensues and he escapes by swimming in the canals never to be seen again.

This take of Jack the Ripper based on the book The Lodger by Marie Lowndes reminds me of Erich from Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera. He's a lonely misfit who just wants to find pure live, the kind in which he will never be left alone. He goes after a theatre star, the symbol of desirability. His obsession with her leads him to force her to be with him and resort to violence. She refuses him due to the exclusive nature of his love, just like Bonner to Slade. Both movies (1925 silent version of the Phantom with Lon Chaney) end with a horsebuggy chase scene and him jumping into the river.

The whole plot is one of alienation. By his unusual nature he moves from place to place and always arouses suspicion. He had a miserable childhood with a broken home and a drunken father. His relationship with his Mother is what drives him to kill, he wants to destroy what he sees as the cause of his sense of abandonment, and he starts with her.
