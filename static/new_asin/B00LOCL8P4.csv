6497065,1,B00LOCL8P4,"Why, oh why, must we be subjected to inane scripts and insepid acting in so many of these holiday movies? Here is another log on the pyre of ""truly bad cinema"". We are encouraged, however, to overlook the plethora of flaws in the name of good intentions and holiday cheer. I weary of the sport. The characters are so shabbily constructed one really doesn't care if they live or die. The story itself progresses too rapidly and then reels off unexpectedly into bizarre flashbacks where the viewer is left uncertain of they're coming or going. The cliche's, corny attempts at humor, and patently UNoriginal plot, make this a tedious journey. It's sad to say it took a exercise of will just o finish a movie-but it did. Go back to your lives citizens. There is truly nothing to see here.",1498953600,,784,4.607142857142857

6497084,1,B00LOCL8P4,I would not want to have my name on this movie. I quit it when the sheriff dropped his teenage daughter and her friend in the middle of town at night so he could go see if he still had Santa locked up. Moronic plot.,1482019200,,215,3.8

6497155,1,B00LOCL8P4,The only reason for the one star rating is Dean Cain playing the sheriff.  Without DC this movie would have been a complete failure.  Watching the movie I envisioned that I was a college film professor screening a high schooler's attempt to gain entry into film school.  Thr verdict is still out if they were accepted.  There WAS a chuckle at the end with the credits.  The dog who they referred to as DEWEY has his named spelled DUI.,1481587200,,434,4.443037974683544

6497183,1,B00LOCL8P4,The movement on this movie is VERY slow.  It isn't the usual quality I expected of a movie with Dean Cain in it.  I was dissappointed.,1481241600,,134,4.115384615384615

6497216,1,B00LOCL8P4,I love Dean Cain but I think he must have made this movie for a friend because it looked like something thrown together and made with an old video camera.  Could have been a good Christmas movie with better actors and a bigger budget.,1480896000,,234,4.318181818181818

6497237,1,B00LOCL8P4,"We started watching this movie but it was a waste of time. They tried to do some play offs of ""Andy Griffith"" and ""Barney fife"" and even had an ""Otis"" type character but they were very cheesy. Slow story line. Santa Claus appeared randomly in his home.

6497241,4,B00LOCL8P4,"So bad that it's good- recommended for anyone who enjoys schadenfreude and/or Troll 2. The set and costume designers did a real doozy on this one and GOOD GRIEF is the acting bad. Whoever created this whopper could win a Christmas Razzie. I genuinely feel bad for Dean Cain here- people probably started casting him in decent roles after this out of sheer pity for his obviously spiraling acting career. Keep an eye out for how incredibly poorly the jail set was designed. It is *amazingly* bad. The jail cell looks like it's made of makeshift plastic and the actors playing sheriffs are wearing literal halloween costumes. To top it off, I'm pretty sure the ""kirkland"" dog bed is UN-intentional product placement. What in the ...?? This movie is great example of how basically any untalented-but-motivated person can make a feature film for a sub-par network.
SPOILERS: fairly early on, Dean Cain's character exclaims that he hates Christmas and also expresses that he is very single. Oh man, I wonder what that could possibly mean for his character arc??? Have I even touched on how cringe-worthy the writing is? Heres a quote to leave you with, from perhaps the creepiest, most crazy-eyed Santa ever: A job gives a man hope, and hope makes him a better man. And a better man, a better father. And a better father, a better family. And a better family, a better world. Oye vey.",1479772800,,1379,4.75

All the cast have had great performances in many other movies so I can only assume that the fault must lie with the director... and what is with the cap that Dean ends up wearing the entire movie.  Did they glue it to his head so he couldn't even take it off in the church.
I've seen some pretty bad B rated movies that were 100% better than this movie... I've even see high school productions that were better than this movie.  The best actor in the movie was the police dog.
On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the absolutely worst, this movie rates a 20!  Did I mention this movie is really badly acted?

I hadn't seen a Dean Cain movie so far this season, it was the only reason I watched the movie. I'm probably not the only one.

The good: some of the characters are pretty funny, the ""real heroes don't wear capes"" plaque and the overall story is okay.

The bad: The production quality. It's bad, really bad. REALLY bad. It's not Indie bad, it's amateur bad. Most of the acting is horrible. The Santa is creepy. The love story was forced. Character development was nil.

6497440,1,B00LOCL8P4,"I don't normally review movies but this one was so bad I had to warn you.  How can you make a bad Christmas movie you ask?  It's simple.  Write a bad story, create stupid dialogue, make sure all the teenagers are stupid, hire some lazy production people, make sure you have a director that has no idea what he is doing (oh, and make sure the director has a role in the movie where he directs himself to awkwardly kiss his wife a few times too many), hire a lot of people who couldn't act their way into a high school play, get yourself a creepy Santa, throw in a mean-spirited Methodist minister, make sure the ending is obvious to a three year old and then add some really bad postmodern theology that will make Christians look like idiots. Dean Caine needs to read the scripts before excepting these roles or get a new agent.

Does every Christmas movie have to have broken families?  Can anyone make a movie where parents love one another and get along?  It is possible and if you can't see it then go write something other then a Christmas story.  How about Halloween,  it's avaliable.

I'm not sure what your idea of a family movie is but for me this isn't it. Rent it if you must but don't buy it first.",1417737600,2,1209,4.290748898678414

You aren't going to recognize anyone else in this movie unless you attended church with or went to school with the group of friends behind the production of this low-budget Christmas movie. But if you're looking for family-friendly, you found it. Only the most puritan of minds would find fault with this well-intended film where every story in the movie gets a happy ending. In fact, the only thing offensive about it is the writing, acting, and production values, which are below the scale of a bad made-for-tv movie. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious, and yet we couldn't turn it off.  Santa plays more like a dirty old man than a kindly old elf, and the other cast of one-dimensional characters is on par with an after-school special.

Would I suggest buying it? No.

Would I suggest watching it on your favorite streaming service? Absolutely. I've already watched it twice!

6497459,2,B00LOCL8P4,This movie was painful to get through.  Nice idea but poor acting and very low budget filming.  Wonder what Dean Cain was thinking being in this movie.  Although it is a clean movie...don't waste your money.,1413244800,2,207,4.694444444444445

Even Dean Cain fans will be disappointed.",1516320000,,239,4.1063829787234045

8667364,1,B00LOCL8P4,"Oh my goodness.  Christmas stories are nornally good. (well at least the plot and story itself is good or has a good meaning, this one is no exception.) And normally the acting in most of them is bad. But, this one is even a little creepy. The sherrif (played by Dean Cain) falls asleep after making his teen daughter and a new friend get out of his patrol car, in the dark, in the snow and in the cold and tells them to go back to church. Which is weird to me. After he falls asleep he starts dreaming about all of these different santa's that phase in out of focus saying all of these things to him. The way the santa's look and what they say to him is creepy.
And who makes their kid get out of their car in the dark in the winter? who falls for someone within 2 seconds of meeting them? Just a strange show.",1511654400,,811,4.037267080745342
8667365,1,B00LOCL8P4,"I would like to start by congratulating Small Town Santa for winning the ""worst movie I've ever seen"" award. For ten years, another movie I shall not name held that spot, so props to the entire Small Town Santa crew for all their below average and outstandingly awful work, not to mention the bizarre racist character, the terrible acting, the high school level production quality, and the hat on Dean Cain's head that he never ever removes (seriously, never). Oh, and I must not forget to mention the jail cell with comically large spaces between the bars and an old school lock that one could just reach around and unlock. At one point, Cane's character, baffled that Santa has escaped again, asks ""Did I forget to lock it?"" I laughed a lot during the movie, but never at the jokes.

Some of the other reviewers have called this a sweet, family movie. I honestly don't know what they mean by this. It's full of mean caricatures, wooden relationships, and bad parenting decisions (Oh, Dean Cain, you kicked my child out of the car in below zero weather and no way to get home, but you are so cute, I'll let it go...actual scene). The only people who would be impressed by this movie are those who have literally never seen a movie before. However, it's also possible that these people would still be more impressed by the Lumiere train.

I rarely write reviews, and my husband asked me, why bother? The kids didn't love it, but they didn't hate it as much as I did. But I feel compelled to do a public service announcement and counteract the crazy 3.5 star rating this has received. This movie is bad. Very very bad. Like oh my god how did this get made bad. You can find a better family movie to watch. There, I've done my civic duty.",1511481600,,1736,4.473186119873817
