5024097,1,B006WNMHYQ,"The fact that someone felt that The Tooth Fairy needed a followup is amazing in it's own right, but then to stick Larry The Cable Guy (who's schtick got old many years ago) in the place of the charismatic Rock is just embarrassing.  Skip this one - not even the kids will laugh.",1329868800,13,278,4.245283018867925

Definitely worth a watch, different enough from the first to keep it interesting and maintain focus.
It obviously has similarities with the first in that he becomes the Tooth Fairy for putting his foot in it! From there its all new stuff!",1354924800,,477,4.370786516853933

5024228,1,B006WNMHYQ,"Loved the original with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Number 2 was so bad we stopped watching within the first 20 minutes. The budget differences ($48 million for the first one and $5 million for number 2) was oh so painfully obvious. The casting, effects, and acting of Tooth Fairy 2 was lame. Dwayne Johnson, Julie Andrews, Ashley Judd in the original vs Larry the Cable Guy (who I do like, but not in this) and a cast of unknowns. The original gets 5 Stars and number 2 gets only a single star, and I'm being generous with a single star. Pure trash! Don't waste your money!

5024239,5,B006WNMHYQ,"One of the funniest movies starring Larry the Cable Guy, just looking at him dressing up like the tooth fairy made me laugh so hard that I had to run to the bathroom. This movie was much better than Tooth Fairy starr
ing The Rock he's nowhere as funny in this role as a fat hillbilly is.",1346976000,,287,4.052631578947368
5024240,3,B006WNMHYQ,It was not ask good as the first. No kids choice award for Larry the Cable Guy. Maybe he should stick to stand up comedy only.,1346889600,,126,3.8846153846153846
5024241,3,B006WNMHYQ,"When I watched the trailer for this film I had low expectations.  It looked so cheesy and predictable.  However, I was wrong.  My kids loved it!  I have to admit I really enjoyed it too.  It is lighthearted but does have a story too.  Yes it is a liitle cheesy but you will really enjoy watching this with your family.",1346889600,,318,4.216666666666667
5024242,3,B006WNMHYQ,Not nearly as good as the first tooth fairy with the Rock.  Also a bit disappointed that they don't address the stealing of  of the presents by the boyfriend.,1346889600,,158,4.413793103448276
5024243,5,B006WNMHYQ,"the movie was very entertaining and my grandchildren loved it. I run a daycare and the ""older kids"" watch it when the babies were in for their naps. Good rainy day entertainment.",1346889600,,178,4.59375
5024244,5,B006WNMHYQ,"This movie is refreshing in a day and age where SEX is being sold even to children on the big screen.
About the only thing you will see here is a little bit of cleavage and a man/women sharing a kiss a few times.

The language does not go above the word ""Geez, Jimminy Christmas and ... Cheese and Crackers""
As for violence - this is a slapstick comedy - a few zapps with a magic wand and a few slaps here and there

Overall the graphics for the magic scenes could be better - but for a childrens movie - it is excellent.

Take the time and spend it with your children - rent this movie, pop some pop-corn and spend some time together.
It is a great family movie - that will leave your children laughing.",1344643200,,704,4.086956521739131

5024246,3,B006WNMHYQ,"I expected more out of this movie...the first movie was definitely better! The plot was somewhat good but the Larry the Cable Guy could never replace the Rock. The Rock made it funny. Larry, however, didn't. I think I laughed like 3 times throughout the whole movie. The first was definitely better!",1340841600,,299,4.769230769230769

5024248,4,B006WNMHYQ,"My kids loved it that the ""Head Fairy"" was a kid.  They know Larry the Cable Guy and his redneck ways, so the farce was complete.  Total turn-around from the Rock version.",1337040000,5,171,4.3125
5024259,4,B006WNMHYQ,"I know everyone has their own opinions on everything; here is mine:

I LOVE Larry, he is so funny.  This movie is nothing like the last one, except he is the fairy. There are all different actors, and frankly it is not as funny as you would think.  I am sorry Larry, but the Rock has you beat on the funny portion. This could be due to the fact that the Rock is a wrestler and actor of a different type, so to speak. And knowing Larry is in the movie you just expect it to be hilarious, I don't know.  I was actually disapointed in it.

As far as the person selling this, they did a fantastic job. The items was as described, a good price, and the shipping was fast, thank you.",1336953600,4,677,4.022388059701493
5024260,3,B006WNMHYQ,I liked this film because of Larry the cable guy...but the story was the same. I thought it would be funnier.,1336953600,,109,4.238095238095238
5024261,5,B006WNMHYQ,Cute story and enjoyed the actress Brady Reiter who complemented Larry the Cable Guy.  Great movie for the younger audience members.,1336435200,2,132,5.285714285714286
5024262,5,B006WNMHYQ,Funny & heart warming film. Much better than the first Tooth Fairy. Larry makes a great tooth fairy. Good fun for the entire family.,1335225600,3,132,4.541666666666667
5024263,3,B006WNMHYQ,it was a good movie but i think the first one was better i would recommend it to my friends,1334793600,,91,3.6
5024264,5,B006WNMHYQ,"I just purchased this along with another movie today. I had a coupon and it was on sale so I only paid $4 for it.

Some people disliked this movie but I thought it was a nice sweet movie. I also have the first movie and I thought this one was better than the first. I did have that fear that it wouldn't be such a good movie because it was one of those direct to video movies. I have to say it was funnier than the first as well. Our family really liked both movies.",1333843200,,466,3.8541666666666665
5024265,2,B006WNMHYQ,"It's been a while since I've seen the first Tooth Fairy starring The Rock, but from what I can remember, it was way better than the sequel that came out on DVD March 6th. I don't know if Tooth Fairy 2 was professionally considered a flop, but it definitely was in my opinion.

I used to be a fan of Larry the Cable Guy but after seeing the roles he's chosen to play, I no longer consider myself a fan. The funniest part of the movie was seeing him in the fairy getup with the tutu before he changed to the pink overalls.

Children ages 5-8 would probably find the humor in this movie, but as an adult I found it seriously lacking.",1333324800,,630,4.1138211382113825
5024266,4,B006WNMHYQ,A slightly different twist on a theme.  Some decent laughs throughout and a few lessons to learn along the way.  Although this is geared towards kids some of the humor can only be understood from an adult perspective.  Its still enjoyable for any age.,1332979200,,251,4.659090909090909
5024267,3,B006WNMHYQ,"This doesn't hold a candle, not even a spark to the original. We own and love the first Toothfairy film. This is a LOW budget knockoff. It feels lIke a HEY VERN MOVIE. Remember those? Lol!! There is obviously a smattering of Larry fans who will add this to their collection, but I'm gonna pass! The zoo is a much better use of an hour +.",1332979200,,337,4.121212121212121
5024268,5,B006WNMHYQ,"I judged this by the same standards I would judge an adult movie:

Did it keep my attention throughout the film?
Was the story-telling original?
Was the sequence of events credible (within the context of the fantasy)?
Was the humor original and did I laugh spontaneously?
Were the casting choices and acting good?

I consider myself a harsh but fair critic, judging a work by its merit within its own genre. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Tooth Fairy 2.""",1332547200,11,445,4.766233766233766
5024279,4,B006WNMHYQ,"Here's what one of our youth film critics had to say about this film: Ten teeth in ten days sounds impossible for a brand new tooth fairy helper, right?  Well Larry Guithery (Larry the Cable Guy) makes it possible.  He is on a mission, but not just any mission, a mission to restore faith in the tooth fairy and to keep his best memory.  This is an enjoyable movie.  There isn't a dull moment or a moment when I did not laugh.  The main characters in this film include Larry Guithery (Larry the Cable Guy; Cars 1 and Cars 2).  Other main characters are Beauregard ""Bo"" Billings (David Mackey), Brook (Erin Beute), the adorable tooth fairy, Nyx (Bradley Reiter).  All of the tooth fairy costumes are out of this world.  When I saw Larry in a pink tutu and tights I laughed my head off!  That is one of my favorite costumes and scenes.  I recommend this movie for ages 5-12.  If parents watch this movie with their kids, they will find it to be funny and a good story.  Kids of these ages will like this film because of the jokes and comedy.  Tooth Fairy 2 ranges from physical and exaggerated comedy to romance and love.  It has fart jokes and funny dancing that made both my mom and I laugh.  I knew from the moment I saw Larry the Cable Guy that this movie is hilarious and I was right.  Even though some of the silly jokes do not fully grab my attention and make me laugh, I give Tooth Fairy 2 , four stars.  So if you are in the mood for some comedy, or if you are a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, mark your calendar for the premiere of Tooth Fairy 2. Jennifer H, KIDS FIRST!

5024280,1,B006WNMHYQ,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen.  The little fairy girl was good, but
Larry the cable buy was horrific.  The Beeauregard guy was the worst actor ever.
Ha ha this movie sucked.  Do not buy it.",1332028800,3,201,4.102564102564102
5024281,2,B006WNMHYQ,"Well, it's a cute movie for kids who find a big, hairy guy wearing a pink tutu funny. We were fans of the Toothfairy starring Dwayne Johnson in fact the kids still watch it. While there was no original cast members for the toothfairy age kids this movie is fun.

Larry does an OK job being embarrassed. My favorite scene was when he turned into a toothfairy in front of two of his male friends while watching the game. Too funny!

While I expected more laughs from my kids, they were not bored.",1331769600,,494,4.301075268817204
5024282,2,B006WNMHYQ,"The little girl that plays the main part of the main tooth fairy was a poor choice. The movie could have been way better with just keeping Julie Andrews, Billy Crystal and the tall skinny tooth fairy from the original movie. You can change which man becomes a tooth fairy, but the original cast was awesome and I found this one to stink. In this movie the main tooth fairy lady (kid) does all the parts that the supporting cast did in the other movie ie checking in on Larry, equipping, critiquing etc. Really was disappointed that I bought the movie new instead of waiting to purchase it used.",1331769600,,594,4.458715596330276
5024283,5,B006WNMHYQ,"I thought this movie was hilarious and just as good as the original. This one may even be funnier because of Larry the Cable Guy's country-boy humor. Larry Guthrie has had his 15 minutes of fame as Bowling Champion. His girlfriend, Brooke has left him and now dating Bo, a man who is running for Mayor. When Larry accidentally tells Brooke's student not to believe in fairy tales or the Tooth Fairy, he's sent to Fairy World by Nyx. He's told to collect 10 teeth in 10 days or Nyx will take away his most cherished memory. If you love slapstick, Southern-country jokes and the original, you'll definitely love TOOTH FAIRY 2!!!",1331683200,,626,4.598214285714286

Funniest thing I've every seen!! I will definitely be recommending this movie. Clean and cute.,1331683200,,264,4.408163265306122
5024285,4,B006WNMHYQ,"This is a great movie for kids at that tooth fairy age. Larry the Cable Guy, a caricature individual commits a faux pas by inadvertently informing a child the tooth fairy is a fairy tale. As penance he must collect ten teeth in ten days. He has to do this while attempting to win back the love of his life, who is engaged to the town's car dealer, who is also running for mayor. Larry shows he has a big heart and always wants to do the right thing.

The humor was geared toward kids. There were no innuendos for adults to ponder. I would think this film is geared more for girls than boys.",1331510400,,590,4.130434782608695

5024287,4,B006WNMHYQ,Haven't seen the movie but parts of the movie was shot in my neighborhood. Larry and his crew where so cool and down to Earth Like normal folk Imagine that  My son got a photo with him just passing by where they were filming inside one of the homes Larry's a good ol' boy with a good heart. so the movie has to reflect that.

For anyone that wants to know if it's a great movie for kids, my 4 and 5 year old love it. There is nothing offensive about it. It's not going to win any Oscars but I'm pretty sure the makers didn't expect a nomination. There is no violence and it's a cute story. Nothing about it you'll have to explain to your kids later.
