5053464,3,B0073IZS3G,"There is some interesting information here. A lot of accusations that chemotherapy is poison that causes death and increases cancer after a certain point. It emphasizes that some ""alternative"" therapies have merit. But the documentary collapses in the middle when it relies on the opinions of conspiracy theorists at Fox News. *SPOILER ALERT* And in the end, the results for the patients do not seem to indicate a very good outcome no matter what.

At the heart of this documentary about cancer is an attack on the bureaucrats and policies of the Federal Government -- specifically the Food and Drug Administration. The film accuses the agency of corruption and collusion with the drug industry. It literally animates a map of the situation as showing money coming from the corporations, going over to Congress, and then part of that goes to the FDA, and finally people from the FDA go on to become professional consultants or some such for the pharmaceutical industry. No doubt some of this goes on.

However, the point of the accusers seems to be that patients and caretakers ought to have the right to choose whatever doctor and treatment they want. Cancer patients are seen discussing their dire situations and their interest in pursuing alternative, non-FDA-approved treatments. A doctor in Texas is shown as being vilified by the gov't because his allegedly effective treatment has not undergone rigorous testing via an expensive approval process. Patients are shown basically ""going underground"" to pursue their cures because the gov't is trying to thwart their efforts. The accusation is that the drug companies want to increase their profits by keeping people sick.

The worst part of this documentary proves that it has skewed political motivations as footage incorporates the worst Fox News pundits for evidence of conspiracy. Glenn Beck and Alan Keyes are presented as sound voices in the fight for freedom of medical decision making. Clearly, this was a huge mistake on the part of the filmmakers, and they need to be admonished for doing this. It makes the entire film seem illegitimate and a waste of time.

The filmmakers' point almost dies at that section, but continues on nonetheless. *SPOILER ALERT* In the end, their purpose suffers a mortal wound, because several people in the film, who pursued non-traditional treatment, passed away from their aggressive cancers. It is a terribly sad process to watch and unfortunate, but at least the filmmakers did not end the documentary prematurely without presenting the inconvenient end stories of these people's lives. All of the patients and caretakers come off as noble in their pursuit of expanded freedom, but the documentary does not convince one that the awful side effects of conventional radiation and chemotherapy are particularly more deadly than, or less successful than, alternative treatment or even no treatment at all.

""Getting cancer sucks badly"" is the take away. And only momentarily do the filmmakers concentrate on the message of prevention as being more effective than treatment. Perhaps they could do their best to investigate the ways in which people should avoid cancerous environmental factors or lifestyle choices with their next film. The food industry and chemical industry surely have plenty to answer for as much as the institutional targets of ""Cut Poison Burn"" -- FDA, the American Cancer Society, and the American Medical Association.",1336694400,19,3433,5.200723327305606
5053465,5,B0073IZS3G,"We are blessed to welcome a crop of well-made and courageous documentaries in recent years intended to
help viewers understand more about the reality of ""health' care in this country, and more importantly, about
the power of pursuing your own alternative informed choices.  This dvd focuses primarily on the heartbreaking
struggle of several families, in particular the Navarro's- to merely ""choose"" a route to health and possible
healing for their loved one.

  Many of us might not know the insidious level of power and control the FDA has on all reaches of human
experience- food and health care are central to our existence.  While naturopathic and holistic choices
have resulted in healing and health for many, this film focuses on the medical doctors and scientists who
themselves are suppressed , threatened, hauled into court, jailed and even killed (Gerson) when their remedies
heal cancer- and heal cancer with comfort and balance, rather than with the suffering and malicious side effects
of outdated chemo and radiation.
  Cancer is currently being ""treated"" by horrific medical means which kill the patient sooner or later,
and the struggle to expose and stop this practice is central to this film.  This film proposes that these methods
are actually unscientific- yet profitable for an elite few.  See for yourself.

  Enlightening and well done.",1333324800,35,1360,5.216589861751152

5053475,5,B0073IZS3G,"This is pretty sad documentary and if you are a cancer patient, think twice before you go through chemotherapy treatment. Successful therapy is documented only on lymphoma, testicular cancer and children's leukemia. And it is not one size fits all, as we can see quite often in our medical clinics. And the latest studies about chemo are, that they actually encourage cancer growth in many instances. Do your own research and do not succumb to a fear, that most physicians will inflict on you.  $41 billion is not a small change for chemo manufacturers.",1357689600,14,553,4.882978723404255

8509278,5,B0073IZS3G,"Pretty even-handed expose of the resistance to any non-conventional cancer treatment. Having seen my father be cut, poisoned and burned to death years ago, I can't help but agree that current cancer treatment is nothing short of barbaric. Rarely are the long-term effects of chemo and radiation discussed -- it's all rah-rah, conventional treatment. As mentioned in the documentary, diet and prevention are key, but rarely is that discussed either, and a whole other documentary about the control over our diets and the suppression as ""quackery"" by any doctor who tries to guide us away from the toxic Standard American Diet (SAD) by Big Food could be made. A saying I read recently comes to mind: Modern medicine has progressed to the point where there's hardly a healthy person left.",1444435200,3,785,5.046153846153846
