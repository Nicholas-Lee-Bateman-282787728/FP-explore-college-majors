1668814,5,B00005UW9U,"This is a nice little film suitable for the entire family.  And - with all the current interest in fantasy, etc. - should prove popular with the younger set.  For the rest of, there is the pleasure of seeing the great Robert Davi in a truly good film.  He plays the wizard, Merlin, both in the flashback footage and in his modern incarnation and is wonderful in both.  If you're looking for a nice evening around the tube with the family - this is the film for you.",1010707200,25,465,4.25
