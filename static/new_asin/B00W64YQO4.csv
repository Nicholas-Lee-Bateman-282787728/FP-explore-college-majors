8712261,4,B00W64YQO4,"Subtitled.

Chronicles the efforts of a group of woman as they protest different mostly political positions of government. To draw attention to their protests they partially disrobe. The authorities crack down upon them which is not pleasant to see. Engaging and insightful.",1466208000,,274,5.523809523809524

8712265,5,B00W64YQO4,"While the remarkable Citizen Four dominated the genre on account of its historical resonance and the prescience of the filmmakers in picking up on the centrality of Snowdens mission while in progress, I felt that Je Suis Femen was the superior film. Moving, finely detailed, with well drawn characterisation, the fact is that patriarchy is an even more significant problem than mass surveillance. But the film is much more than the examination of an issue.
As we watch the gritty history of the rise and decline of Femen, we are witnessing the heart rendering dynamics of youthful idealism and political activism under the heel of difficult and besetting convention and merciless cynicism. Oksana, looking like Nestor Makno , as she muses over an open fire singing traditional Ukrainian songs, is like a moth to the flame , and the punctual implications are distressing for those who actually might care, to say the least.
IMO, great , not merely  good.",1442534400,3,953,4.9937106918239
8712266,5,B00W64YQO4,"While nudity as protest is old news in the West, FEMEN made some waves in Eastern Europe (2008-2013). The Ukrainian group's &eacute;minence grise ironically was a man (Victor Svyatski) who purportedly chose attractive young women likeliest to draw attention to the issues FEMEN would go on to champion. Inna Shevchenko, among the core original members in Ukraine (now heading their Paris HQ, as FEMEN is understandably in self-exile), posits that the patriarchal system is so ingrained in Ukrainian women that FEMEN may never have come to fruition without Svyatski (not stated in this documentary, but in another titled ""Ukraine is not a Brothel"", a slogan used by FEMEN at one point). This is only one of many controversies around a protest group most controversial for its preferred mode of raising awareness.

During an interview in ""I Am FEMEN"", Anna Hutsol (the principal organizer of FEMEN in Ukraine from its inception) states:
""...we need women who look aggressive, beautiful, and sexy, because Femen addresses another paradox in our society: How can such a beautiful woman, who you normally see in a beauty salon, be a feminist? People ask: Why is this sex object protesting? I'm used to seing her in porno films, in newpapers, in my bed, or in the kitchen. I'm not used to seeing this object protesting.""

Statements like these obviously open up a can of worms for many people, including some feminists. Regardless, there is no denying that the young women of FEMEN had some guts in opposing various wrongs in a region with many wrongs to right. In one of the tenser segments of ""I Am FEMEN"", a trip to poke a stick in the eye of Alexander Lukashenko (the dictator of Belarus) in front of the Minsk KGB office predictably leads to three FEMEN members being swiftly disappeared, albeit temporarily. I won't spoil the details of this story for you, or those of their trip to Moscow to shame the tyrant Putin. Suffice it to say, you don't want to get on the wrong side of the secret police.

A shortcoming of the documentary is a failure to look beyond the insular group and evaluate if FEMEN had a positive impact in Ukraine (again, a controversial issue). Still, while many won't agree with their methods, standing against political oppression and the designation of women as 2nd class citizens is something worth taking your shirt off for, even in freezing weather. ""I Am FEMEN"" is a good watch, regardless of whether it is viewed for academic pursuits, entertainment, enlightenment, or inspiration.",1441411200,2,2509,4.912735849056604
8712267,4,B00W64YQO4,"In the 2014 documentary I AM FEMEN women take the silly double standard that allows public breast-baring only to men and turn it into a shortcut to raise awareness of patriarchy's ugliest manifestations, such as three Ukrainian men getting a slap on the wrist for the rape and murder of a girl.  The film follows mostly Oksana Shachko, one of the half-dozen or so young women demonstrating throughout Europe with the activist group FEMEN, whose web site describes the organization as an ""international womens movement of brave topless female activists painted with the slogans,"" working against ""patriarchy and humiliation.""

Would FEMEN's message reach as many people had Ms. Schachko and her fellow female colleagues, instead of demonstrating topless, created petitions to demand justice for that girl those three men killed, and would anyone have wanted to make a movie that millions will see?  I don't know, but one cannot deny FEMEN is getting attention with its chosen method of operation, although one should not expect I AM FEMEN to wrap up with what you'd call a victory for the group.  However, as the I AM FEMEN closing credits roll, it is clear this is just the beginning of the FEMEN story.

Meanwhile in the United States, I viewed I AM FEMEN in August 2015, just as women posing topless for tourist photos in New York City's  Times Square, drawing the ire of the mayor and governor even though it is legal in New York for women to bare their breasts in public, was in the news.  It takes a man to see women do something lawful and say, to quote Governor Andrew Cuomo, it needs to be stopped.",1440547200,,1606,4.755395683453237
8712268,5,B00W64YQO4,"Filmed mostly in 2012. Initial inspiration was sexual exploitation of women, then there was the rape of a young girl, Oksana Makar, by three men who later tried to cover their crime by burning her alive. She later needed amputation of an arm and both feet; subsequently dying. Two of the men initially, through a corrupt political system, were freed, but later found guilty.
At the risk of their own lives they are bringing consciousness of female rights to be free from abuse as property as mostly supported from patriarchal and religious culture.
Started and active in Eastern Europe, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and now in several other countries. Small numbers of active participants in each country, but determined. Arrested, beaten, abused, placed in inhuman isolation, threatened by police in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia (and all three places with secret Russian police participating). Consistent with what is happening in Ukraine recently.",1438128000,3,945,5.306666666666667
8712269,4,B00W64YQO4,Amazing to see the courage of these young women in standing up against an oppressive regime.  I'm glad I finally watched this after putting it off for awhile.,1437436800,,158,4.642857142857143
