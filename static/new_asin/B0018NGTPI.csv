Time Life, I suppose, has the right to censor it if they own it, but all that does is tell me that Time Life cannot be trusted with the original content of any property they acquire.  This will backfire for them in the end.  Time Life should offer a censored and uncensored version.  Also, they could have released the original under a psuedonym or something, if they are embarrassed to have ""TIME LIFE"" on the dvd cover!

Find your ren and stimpy elsewhere, if you can.",1325203200,,496,4.455555555555556
8270163,3,B0018NGTPI,"During the time that Ren and Stimpy came about, the animation industry was in complete and total disaster. All the animation was uninteresting, still, and lifeless. Stories and jokes were put to an absolute halt, and the cartoon themselves were either one of three things: boring, for kids, and poorly written. All three, in fact. I tihkn that when the first season of this show came about, it actually made me give a crap about cartoons again.

The show was a subversive, interesting cartoon collection of Ren, a mentally deranged, psychotically and emotionally confused chihuahua, and the less-sane, mentally damaged Stimpy. The gags were completly unleashed, and the artists got to run riot, creating some of the greatest, if not THE greatest, expressions ever presented in a cartoon. The characterization and story progression was excellent, creating some of the most addictively hiliarious characters ever brought up.

Whatever DID happen to Ren and Stimpy? Nickelodeon, the children's network that brought this potentially astounding show to life, had instantly become nervous of the content John Kricfalusi (animation pioneer who did a Mighty Mouse revival and president of Spumco), brought upon to the audience watching.  They had constantly given out ham-fisted, eye-rollingly annoying censors, argued with Spumco almost constantly for delays that were more than likely not even their fault, and brought R&S all the way to MTV, a channel that nobody watched after it stopped showing new music videos. So, on September 25th of 1992, the Spumco team was kicked out.

Let's start with this: Ren and Stimpy NEVER had a good history. The last three seasons of the show, taken over by Games Animation, had gone from halfway decent, to annoyingly repetitive, to almost completly unbearable, dishing out unfunny, generic, and completly random cartoons with half-assed voice acting and mangled production. The R&S revival in 2003 on Spike TV, The Lost Episodes, was totally by John K, and despite some really good improvements over the abysmal Games Animation run, it still wasn't the same.

Here's the problem with this release. Timelife released this set back in 2003, around the time when the entire series was on a digitally
restored re-run, and during the time the Lost Episodes (or Adult Party Cartoon as most know). There's two incredible problems with this Timelife set that made it less than a desirable release. One, the censors (which I will explain later), and two, the fact that the second season is vastly incomplete. In fact, the name 'One-and-a-Half Seasons' sounded a hell of a lot more appriopriate.

This release is now off the market, which nobody really cares about anymore since most can either buy the official ""Uncut"" set of Seasons One and Two, or can just find Spike TV versions on the Internet, after about three-four months of release.

Granted, there's a lot of classics here. The entire first season is uncut and presented here, though, so that fact alone could be worth the price (well, back then). Classics like Stimpy's Invention are yes, uncut.

Here's the thing, though. These episodes are presented in the censors that Nickelodeon presented. So, it feels more like a blank VHS tape recording of the original run of the show than a new, digitally mastered set. Even worse, these seem even more unbearable. Some examples are in the infamous episode 'Powdered Toastman', and 'Sven Hoek'.

Another thing: there are only 20-21 episodes included here. So, why does the set say it includes 42 cartoons? Well, this set features all the fake bumpers John Kricfalusi had put up to block out the annoying commercial time. One such example: Sven Hoek is split into 2 parts. The second part is COUNTED AS AN ACTUAL EPISODE. Timelife seems to just put up decrepit advertising just to make a couple sales. This is wrong, and makes the price even more uncomfortable. But there is an episode here that is Uncut that wasn't uncut on the hopefully ""uncut"" official box set.

Extras are three sing-alongs. Throwaway.

Overall, I'd recommend buying the official box set. This set, though, along with the 'Seasons 1 and 2' set, are THE definite releases of the show, but this one's too mangled to actually recommend a buy.",1299110400,3,4236,5.045779685264664
