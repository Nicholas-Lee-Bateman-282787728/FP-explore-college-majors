546431,5,6303042538,"Unlike ""the McCartney years, which was really good but after hearing the same song from his different bands 5 or six times, this dvd not only had terrific sound and picture quality, but it also had numerous Beatle clips during and after the concert. Unlike the cd release, it is missing a few songs from the cd but makes up for it with Paul & companys' great performance! Definately worth buying not just for the amazing performance & charisma generated, but to see the underrated Linda again! As a former musician, I can honestly say that for a girl that didn't have a music background,she learned & performed like a seasoned musician (she was Pauls perfect mate and I miss hearing her perform with Paul on tour or cd)!",1207958400,3,720,4.589147286821706
546432,3,6303042538,"Ever since his triumphant return to the stage in 1989, Sir Paul McCartney has established himself as quite possibly the finest performer in the history of live performing. His onstage energy permeates from his every move, and his conncection with his audience is, in a word, astounding. Ever major Paul tour since 1989 has either had a live album or concert film released to commemorate it (more of than not, we get both).

1993's ""Paul Is Live"" is from Sir Paul's ""Off The Ground"" tour. Like his 1989 tour, which spawned the immensely entertaining ""Get Back"" concert film as well as one of the greatest live albums ever, the two disc ""Tripping The Live Fantastic"", a cd and concert film were released in commemoration of its success. Both the cd and vhs (now dvd) were called ""Paul Is Live"". Neither the album nor vhs were well received by fans or critics. I don't understand the hate for the album, as it showcases Paul at his energetic and lively best, but I can definitey see why the visual representation of the tour is often reviled.

First of all, let me say that every performance on this tape is excellent. They are all brimming with the youthful vigor and emotion as well as fun that makes Paul a predominant force in the performing field. The setlist is mostly comprised of Beatles hits with a few solo numbers and the new materail thrown in for good measure (the then new material is not very commendable, to be honest), and they're a real thrill to hear, but a pain to watch. That's because the production values of the film are awful.

The editing is a hack job, and the film is shot in a manner that makes it feel like a hastily conceived music video than a tride and true live performance; grainy picture quality, various images being thrown together over Paul onstage, and an often annoying tendency to quickly shift focus on the audience (I don't mind seeing their reaction, but it's somewhat of a discrepancy when it distracts from the main attraction, and what a main attraction it is distracting from). The sound quality is also average at its very best (again, I only have the VHS, but judging from the dvd reviews, there isn't much of an improvement).

While I don't discourage people from buying this dvd, I also don't recommend it as a must have. It's nice to have a keepsake to watch once in awhile, but chances are you'll have a more satisfying experience from Paul's other concert movies as well as his live albums, including the one culled from this tour. Some things are better to heard and not seen, and this is a good example.",1169337600,2,2558,4.578602620087336
546433,5,6303042538,"I am biased.  I saw this show (+ some songs not on here...) back in St. Louis in '93.  Good Rockin' that night for sure.  The best is the old stuff (of course), but C'mon People is one of my favs from that era.  Yes, it is very 'of the times' editing, which is a bit annoying at times, but the music is great.  Robbie and Hamish were a treat to see in his band.  Also, I think it definitely is a testiment to how much better live this guy gets with age.  I saw the Live 8 thing from last year, and I thought 'hmmmm... he's even better yet again'.  I hope he lives forever so the music never stops.  He's the best.  Maybe this wouldn't get a 5 star review from anyone else but me... but 3 stars for this and 4 stars for Get Back just doesn't seem fair.",1159401600,,751,3.8815789473684212
546434,4,6303042538,"1) Mine is the Portuguese edition.

2) Damn Marketing: As in almost everything released, the companys always leave something out, deliberately, so they can release later a ""new expanded special edition"".

I do not know why they left out songs like Off The Ground, Another Day, My Love. They are beautiful songs, played on the tour, and shown on the TV Special.

DVD`s should be an improvement in every sense on what VHS editions were lacking.

What I have said, it applies mostly on Soundtracks, because they often leave out the songs that are the ones that people were looking for, or include different versions. Concert releases: you know they were performed, and simply not included, or poor editing, video and/ or audio. DVD`s,  movies & music: not improving video/ audio, leaving out stuff, sometimes even more than the VHS editions, for instance the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, poor or no extras, well you get my point.",1121904000,3,930,4.898089171974522
546435,3,6303042538,"Yep. Looking for changes in the way Paul makes his concert videos! Ever since Paul left the Beatles in 1970, he's been giving us one great tour after another...and one bad concert film after another. First he gave us Rock Show, which was pretty darn good. Then, Get Back, which was a good effort. Next came this film, Paul is Live. Paul cuts to different performances (and sometimes different footage altogether) within the same song. Some of the footage is in color, some in black and white. Again, it cuts between the two within the same song. The music in this video is awesome. For the casual fan of McCartney, I recommend the ""Paul is Live"" CD. It features the same great music but without the bad video. If you're a die hard fan like I am, you'll probably enjoy this DVD.",1091750400,15,777,4.47887323943662
546436,2,6303042538,"This DVD, the first time you put it in the player, will stink of bad production and really weird editing. Plus, if you know too much about this particular tour you will drive yourself nuts noticing songs out of order. But that said, it gets better after you've watched it a few times.
The live versions of Beatle hits are great - this tour featured Drive My Car's only live outing to date. It's also nice to see Magical Mystery Tour and Lady Madonna - Macca's 88-93 band gave these songs a great rendition.
The bad news starts when you get past those songs, though. Let Me Roll It is very boring with this band. The organ is way too low in the mix on the organ solo...that doesn't help. Plus nothing will ever compare to the blistering version found on Back in the U.S. / World .
The tracks from Off the Ground aren't all that bad, there are five of them on the DVD, and 3 of them are good (Lookin for Changes, Hope of Deliverance, and C'mon People). Peace in the Neighborhood and Biker Like an Icon are songs that have grown on *me*, but I don't guarantee it will do the same for you.
Oh, and as a...um...""bonus"", we get additional versions of Let it Be, Yesterday, and Hey Jude. Let it Be would be good except that the director chose to include the only time Robbie gave a bad LiB guitar solo. Bleech. Yesterday is it's usual self, good, but I've heard it so many times by this point. And Hey Jude is my pic for worst track on the disc...there's just no energy.
An alright DVD, I still watch it occaisionally, but when it's bad, it's really bad.",1081814400,4,1547,4.26530612244898
546437,4,6303042538,"This, like all of other concert films by Paul, suffers from quick editing and many crowd shots and other pieces of film thrown in that have nothing to do with the concert.  But there are a few redeeming factors that make this a better DVD than some of Paul's more recent releases (e.g., ""Back in the US"" or ""The Space Within Us."")

1.  Song selection - This DVD (and its accompanying CD release) is the only place where you will see live performances from his '93 album ""Off The Ground.""

2.  Bonus Songs - The DVD contains 3 songs, ""Let it Be,"" ""Yesterday"" and ""Hey Jude,"" that you will not find on the CD release of this tour.

3.  Unlike the above mentioned concert films (from 2002 and '05, respectively), this DVD features 21 complete songs, and the concert never breaks to show interview or backstage footage, just the music.

No this is not the best concert video I own, but it's better than some of Paul's more recent releases.",1078617600,,935,4.458823529411765
546438,2,6303042538,...the audio is EXTREMELY compressed. Not at all what you expect from DVD technology.,1075852800,,85,5.142857142857143
546439,3,6303042538,"Here's the deal.  When we buy a concert video we want to be at the concert.  That is, some close ups, some long shots, and awesome surround sound.  For the ultimate DVD, let the viewer choose what band member to watch with the ""angle"" button.
We do not want quick takes, with fast cuts, and for goodness sake, no ""artsy"" camera work.  And while you're at it, why don't you focus on the act on stage, NOT THE AUDIENCE!!
This video suffers from mtv-syndrome.  super fast cuts, that prevent you from seeing what's going on, and the oft-mentioned, documentary / archival grainy b&w footage.
Further, whoever directed this video seemed more interested in the audience reactions than what's going on onstage.",1073174400,39,702,4.768595041322314
546440,2,6303042538,"This DVD makes clear why the Talking Heads' ""Stop Making Sense"" DVD should be manditory watching for all wanna-be concert movie makers.  Stop Making Sense provides clear instructions how to make awesome concert movies.  Lessons include no stupid cut-away interviews, few crowd shots, and clear, non-jumpy shots of band members.
This is DVD is just the opposite.  Instead of supporting camera work that emphasizes the performance, we get a ""HOW TO"" on what not to do.  In this DVD we get the ""artsy"" grainy black and white shots for half the performance along with interdispersed stupid video scenery (This scenery is taken from the large screens from the stage that were played during the concert).  As someone who saw this tour live, I can testify that the video cuts of the screen material DOES NOT make one feel closer to the original performance.  Worse, the camera almost NEVER focuses on anyone for more than 2 seconds at a time.  Occaisionally you will get Paul singing, but NEVER do you get to see the finger-work on any musician including Paul (with the possible exception of the first stanza of ""Yesterday"").
This is bad, but truly annoying is the extra junk that has been added to ""spruce up"" songs that just don't need the extras.  The worst example of htis was during the Beatles classic, ""Paperback Writer.""  One might think that Paul singing this classic could stand on its own, but no, the movie makers decided during this song, see-through paperback book pages should cover the screen with ever increasing rapidity.  If you concentrate hard, you can see Paul through the pages, but if you were like me, you were too pissed to care.  Magical Mystery tour also apparently can't stand on its own, needing wierd ""acid colors"" to dominate the display.
As a final annoying aspect to this DVD, it provides a tribute to Linda at the back that shows lots of home movies of Paul's life, along with Beatles and Wings concert footage.  Unfortuately you can only get to it after the end of the credits, and there is no dividing chapters for it.
The ONLY reason I give this 2 stars is because they did not destroy ""Live and Let Die.""  When I saw this tour in DC, that song, with the fireworks and all was awesome, easily the high point of the concert.  It provided me with a fond memory of the show.",1068422400,8,2302,4.651851851851852
546521,3,6303042538,"The songs and the performances are strong, of course, but, as everyone else here notes, the direction and editing on the video seem lazy and misconceived.  Paul is Live doesn't flirt with disaster like the Get Back dvd, but probably this dvd is best for those wanting a souvenir of a concert they attended.  As a document in its own right, it's merely lukewarm.
For a full concert dvd, the Back in the US dvd is the one to get first: the band is smokin hot and the video direction is a little snappier than you'll find on Paul is Live or (lord help you) Get Back.  After Back in the US, the next concert disc to get is probably the Live at the Cavern dvd.
The best solo McCartney dvds are probably the Wingspan and the In the World Tonight documentaries, though fans of Standing Stone will definitely get a charge out of that one too.",1066176000,5,834,4.2993630573248405
546522,3,6303042538,"Well, the DVD in fact have a nice quality in video, and the audio sounds nice... i got a 5.1 sound system and it sounds nice (not as a lord of the rings or the dark side of the moon) but is nice, the video itself was very bad and is not fault of the DVD encoders, but the producer of the original movie... it was terrible... but better than Get Back... admit it!... the things that really disapoints me of this DVD (instead the production of the video) was that menus were too simple and seems like a copy of the Back in the US idea... IS THE SAME SONG!!!... and the ""bonus"" are just a bio of Macca... (nice bio, bad way to post it... 100% text) and a photo album OF THE SAME STUFF OF THE DVD... i can make a better photo album using PowerDVD or something else... xD... well, the sound was not bad... in home teather sounds nice and on the PC sounds bad, but adjust the setup to ""Dolby Headphones"" (this option is a plus and it really improves the ""hall"" stereo sound) and it will sound better.
Well, for a bad movie you can't expect the best DVD... and this is the problem with Macca... his movies are not the best of the world... maybe he need more touring stuff... and not things overproduced and cheap like this, Get Back, Back in the US in some parts (audience shots, some shots of the band and interviews sucked)... maybe he need to involve more in the production and final product... maybe he do best on Red Square production.
Well, is a nice product for collectors... admit it... VHS will not last forever... you have to upgrade or time will eat you!",1065571200,2,1558,4.231543624161074
546523,3,6303042538,"I saw the concert in Charlotte on TV some 10 years ago, and recorded it on VCR. The concert was (I believe) a part of 1993 tour. The performance was absolutely great, and there was not much operator's work - we just saw Paul on stage singing and joking with the audience.
When buyiing this cassette I wanted to get better quality version of that concert, or something similar.
The video proved to be a big disappointment. They show song after song without any chat between. They show videoclip-style kaleidoscope of recordings made at different concert stages during the show. The length of fragments is so short (I think 2 to 3 sec) that you can't even see Paul or his musicians well. So during one song Paul ""changes"" his clothes 20 times. Weird!
They apparently tried to make the video look like it was produced in 60's or early 70's, so most of the time you see Paul either in poor quality black and white on artificially worn and scratched film, or on the background of bright spotlights. They also show a lot of audience, much more than needed to my personal taste. Worse, you can't tell if this audience was shot on Pauls show or somewhere else because you never see the public and the stage in one shot - they are completely isolated.
Overall, the atmosphere is completely gone.
On the other hand, the songs selection is good, and, as I mentioned, the performance is great. If I were to write a review to the ""Paul is live"" CD, that I also own, I would give it 5 stars, but for this video - only 3.",1063065600,8,1506,4.401433691756273

If the editing was meant to be ""artful"" then the verdict has to be: Misguided, complete failure. The jumpy cutting, the switching from b&w to color, the insertions of irrelevant images make this DVD unwatchable.

The cleverly edited version of 3-4 different concerts doesn't bother me; I was impressed that they could edit it that well.  What did distract me, however, was the frequent transition from black/white to color.  Why would a 1993 concert tour even be filmed in black/white in the first place?

Good dose of Beatles classics, some Wings standards, and a few songs from his then-new album. He looks great, he sounds great, and he seems to be having a ball.  What kept me from giving it 5 stars is only the frenetic editing.  It's a composite of several shows, which in itself isn't so bad, but when the splicing is done WITHIN A SONG (or did he change shirts between verse 2 and 3!?), it's un-nerving and you lose some of the magic of live show.  Also, there are some inexplicable cuts between black-and-white and color, and sometimes I want to scream at the camera to stay focused on a shot long enough to appreciate it.  I could do without the tortured-animal footage at the end of the video (which is part of an otherwise delightful montage of Beatles footage and Paul and Linda's home movies), but that's what the fast-forward button is for.

Its the 21st century. I am sure that the video directors and producers have to know by now,
what the viewer is interested in.

If anyone is unsure of how it is done, take a look at the Eagles, Police, or a Michael Jackson concert video as an example.
