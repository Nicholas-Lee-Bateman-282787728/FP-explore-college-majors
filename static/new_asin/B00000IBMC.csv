1221473,5,B00000IBMC,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid and I never tire of watching it. The Gilbreth's are a real family and the movie  is based on the book by Ernestine and Frank, Jr. of the same name. It takes place mainly in the era of  the Roaring Twenties.

Clifton Webb is great as the Dad. He plays him perfectly, except for his girth. Mr. Gilbreth was a ""motion study"" expert. Myrna Loy is perfect as Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who,despite the chaos involved in raising 12 children and a husband, maintains her cool- most of the time.  Jeanne Crain is believable as Anne, the eldest and the other kids were good too.

There is a sequel to the original book and movie, ""Belles On Their Toes"", which is just as good.",1495152000,2,707,4.285714285714286
1221491,4,B00000IBMC,"A few minor changes from the book, but otherwise it stayed true to the original story. The only thing the 2003 movie has in common with the original story is the title. The rest of that movie is a totally different story. I preferred this movie as it keeps the spirit of the book!",1492214400,,280,4.203703703703703

1221494,5,B00000IBMC,"This colorful depiction of life in a family of 12 children stars Clifton Webb as Frank Bunker Gilbreth, an eccentric father who prides himself on some truly unorthodox child-rearing methods. Based on the bestseller by two children of the real Mr. Gilbreth, this charming film co-starring Myrna Loy. From 1950 we get a movie set even further back (Turn of the century?) to Clifton Webb as an expert on saving time. This is a very charming movie and well worth the family viewing. the performances were all fun and well worth seeing. A wonderful slice of life film that is a must-see for everyone.",1488499200,,595,4.730769230769231

1221535,5,B00000IBMC,"I LOVED this movie ever since I saw it on AMC in high school. I've read the book, but I love the movie more, which isn't something I say a lot. The family is so funny. I love frank. His kids seem to (usually) get what they want, even though he is against it. He's a joker, which I find hilarious. Basically, Lillian and Frank decide when they marry to have twelve children, an even dozen. 6 girls and 6 boys. Basically, the movie is just a string of events: the children having their tonsils removed, the kids starting at a new school, their daughter growing up and falling in (and out) of love (not in that order, of course) and there is a hilarious scene with birth control. that's all I say. The movie is funny up to the end. If you've read the book, you know how it ends, but if you haven't....well, I won't spoil it. The book, like yours, mine and ours (also about a big family) is based on a true story, but cheaper by the dozen was a lot happier. I've read a lot about how bad it was in real life and im not sure whether its true or not, but if it is, yours, mine and ours won't seem as happy or as good to me anymore.",1474329600,4,1125,4.004444444444444

1221634,5,B00000IBMC,"This is a classic DVD Movie for the whole family to view - and based on true events.  There was a business-Manager-type-Genius by the name of Frank Bunker Gilbreth who gained international recognition for his efficiency work standards.  The real comedy in this movie was how Frank B. Gilbreth actually used his efficiency work standards to raise all of his 12 children?!  One of the benefits in this comedy is exposure to true-to-life circumstances in the turn-of-the-Century environment of a family, neighborhood and society.  For the classic movie officionado, among the child stars this movie could very well have been the start of or a step in several of their acting careers.  For example, the oldest daughter Ann is the actress Jeanne Crain?  Despite the tragic death of Frank B. Gilbreth at the end of the movie, his wife Lillian (played by Myrna Loy) took the baton to carry on his efficiency work standard methods with great success and raised 12 youngsters. This movie is based on a biographical bestseller and includes great humor with an outstanding cast of Actors.",1423353600,,1077,4.955555555555556

I never saw the movie until dozen years or so ago and it was good, but by now, I didn't remember much of it...but the movie was great. I have kept it for my grand kids to watch. I still remember that line when they just got married and on the train going to their honeymoon...and they are talking about how many children to have and the mother says she'd like maybe a dozen children and it'd be nice if it was 6 girls and 6 boys.  So the father takes out his notebook and writes.. ""remember to have 12 children, 6 girls and 6 boys"". THe teacher (Mrs. Gordon) broke out laughing! Silly thing to remember, but I do!

1221835,5,B00000IBMC,"This 1950 movie (Cheaper By The Dozen)was made at least 10 years before it became politically incorrect to question the heart motivation of feminism in Planned Parenthood. In one shocking (to today's audience) scene, a Planned Parenthood representative says with a sneer ""how disgusting"" when she realizes Myrna Loy has 12 children. This was before legalized abortion changed the debate entirely from the rights of the family to the rights of the pregnant woman.  Americans routinely abort over 1 million babies a year. In New York City, more black babies are aborted than born.  ""How disgusting"" is right.",1329609600,,606,5.173469387755102

1221837,5,B00000IBMC,"This is a charming early ''50's comedy that has managed to hold up extremely well over the past half century plus. It concerns the trial and tribulations of two efficiency experts/engineers who raise a brood of 12 kids in the 1920's. Narrated by actress Jeanne Crain who tells their story in retrospect and portrays the oldest daughter in the Gilbreath family, it is composed of charming and riotous vignettes that walk the family through the normal process of growing up in a large family. Particular focus is placed on the older daughters and their frustrating attempts to mature which are often thwarted unsuccessfully by their father Frank (Clifton Webb) while their mother Lillian (Myrna Loy) provides stability and a sane presence amidst the inevitable commotion.
The script, which was based on a book by daughter Ernestine Gilbreath, is funny and fast paced. While the children share a lot of screen time, it is Webb and Loy who steal the show.
If you are a fan of the iconic and highly stylized Webb, this is a must see performance. Webb, who began his career as a professional dancer, puts on his dancing shoes and manages to do some fast paced dancing which clearly illustrates that Webb was more than a talented actor.
Loy is totally believable as the mother, though I have to admit that casting her with Webb was far more believable than I would have imagined.
This is a cool escapist comedy that is wonderfully believable and a joy to watch.",1323993600,,1454,4.773809523809524

1221868,5,B00000IBMC,"This is a great film, lovingly told about a loving father.  That in itself is not something you see everyday, at least in this day and age.  I personally love the wardrobe of the father.  Even in his P.J.s he is a manly man.  That's how everyone should remember their father.

A heart warming film about the great feeling of being part of a loving, well adjusted, large family.  There is even a great scene where Planned Parenthood, still in its infancy, comes into their home to scorn the irresponsibility to the world of two people deciding that they want a large family to love, and love this couple does.  It is really neat to see on film the genuine pride in the eye of a father as he beams at his sons and daughters and gobbles up each and every stage of their lives.  Even when he joshes his son you can see that the boy knows that it's done in love.  Call me a ham, but I dig an earnest movie about the redeeming value of striving to have a strong family.

The movie, unlike the remake, deals with the real life tragedy of losing someone that gave order to your world and how his strength can live on in those that learned from his example.  Just a great, positive film about what family life could and should be like.",1307318400,2,1226,4.241379310344827

It's fun to watch a man obsessed with efficiency and time patriarch a growing family that eventually totals 14. Also cracked me up to watch all of them pile into a car - a feat impossible today using proper car seats! The family meetings were a wonderful look into the diplomacy of a family. It was a bit sad that while family values were upheld, the end of the movie was a disappointing conversation between the narrating daughter and her recently deceased father.

Tom Baker (played by the very funny Steve Martin) decides to take his family on vacation in the wilderness.

One is pregnant and expecting soon, and the other just graduated from high school and leaving to go to college in Chiciago. But these things are going to become the least of his worries when his rival Jimmy Mertaugh who is a billionaire seems to think he is better than Tom at everything. Then this starts a funny competition that will have you laughing out of your seat. Steve Martin was ten times funnier in this one than the first one.

As a child it made me think differently about to get things done and I love his demonstration of how to bath. This is a classic family movie and touches my heart every time I watch it.

1221944,4,B00000IBMC,"The book by the same name was a best seller and for good reason.  It is touching, entertaining, funny, moving, etc.  This movie in 1950 captures that spirit.  The setting is the years before and after World War I.

The father was strict, but he never took himself too seriously, and he dearly loved his wife and each of their children.  And they loved him.

The movie is a series of some of the best vignettes in the book.  A lot of the anecdotes had to be left out, of course.  The book includes scenes from their courtship and from Gilbreth's earlier life.

He was from a poor family and started out as a bricklayer's apprentice.  Laying bricks and watching what he was doing and how he was doing it led him to develop the principles of time-and-motion study.  Soon, he started his own bricklaying business; and by applying his principles, he could get a bricklaying job done three-times faster than his competitors.  Also, his methods were such that his workmen did not get as tired.  Also, as I recall, he gave them a five-minute break every hour.  Because he could complete three jobs in the time it took his competitors to complete one, he was able to afford to underbid his competitors and still make more profit.  He paid his workers higher wages than his competitors, hence he was able to hire the best workers, which further increased his competitive advantage.  With the money he made, he finally set himself up in business as an ""efficiency expert"", an unheard-of field at the time.

There are also scenes of the courtship of these two who were from opposite sides of the track.  Her mother was opposed to the match, of course.  She didn't listen and was happy the rest of her life.

In these times, when children are raised by daycare centers and TV sets, it is difficult to comprehend a family like the Gilbreths.  It was less difficult at the time this movie came out.  Not all families were as happy but many were.  The book and the movie are less about raising a family efficiently than about raising them well.  Mrs. Gilbreth was a psychologist and understood that.  Instead of dismissing this movie and the book as make-believe, people with children would do well to get the book and try to learn from it.

Also, enjoy it.  The book and the movie are funny, thought-provoking and moving.",1155772800,7,2306,4.574572127139365
1221945,4,B00000IBMC,"CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN is a funny yet sobering looking back at a turn of the century America that had nothing to do with its historical reality. Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey were two children in a brood of a dozen, all of whom were raised by a stern, military-minded father who wished to test his ideas on industrial efficiency on his own family. The father, well-played by Clifton Webb, comes across as the prototypical Victorian father from a previous generation of such. His job was to increase the production efficiency of industry, a task that he was so good at, that he saw no reason why the same principles could not be applied to the mass raising of a very large family. Myrna Loy is the mother who has to balance the stern approach of her husband with the realization that what works on the assembly line of a factory does not carry over to the assembly line of a house.

CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN is not a plot-driven film. Indeed, it is mostly a series of vignettes whose only link is to show a view of how a huge family collectively experienced the comedy of a basically good-natured clan, all of whom slowly began to realize that the whole must be greater than the sum of the parts. As director Walter Lang presented each of the clan, he did so against a backdrop of an America that seems much like the rural-based cartoons which showed an idealized small-town nation that existed in a political and social vacuum. Nowhere in the film is there the slightest hint that outside the doors of the family house were there any economic dislocations or social inequalities. The joy of the film, then, rests in how the family members bounce off each other and off society at large. The father, Mr. Gilbreth, films his entire family having their tonsils removed so as to allow him to make suggestions to improve future tonsillectomies. He takes his children to their new school and lectures the principal on the proper pedagogy of teaching. He accompanies his eldest daughter to her high school prom as an unwelcome chaperone. And while all this is going on, his wife acts as the lubricant who reduces the stress and friction that would have ripped apart any other family. The audience laughs at this, but this laughter is not the sort that arises from slapstick and farce. Rather, it originates in the all too human understanding that life has its comic side even while potential tragedy lurks uncomfortably close.

By the film's end, the viewer has seen a sanitized version not only of an America that never was but also of a family unity that may have been, but its essential cohesiveness of love and support lingers in the imagination long enough to make that viewer feel a sense of kinship and loss. CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN is a rare treat of how one family prospered against the odds of numbers.",1153872000,3,2813,4.601593625498008

From a strict father who only wants the best for his children, to the caring mother who wants the same but lets the children get away with more than the father would. This movie has very little in common with the Martin remake, the only thing they really have in common is that there are twelve children and that's about it. While the new film sticks to the comedy and has no realistic story-line, this film sticks to realism and still has a lot of funny moments. The end of the film is really touching and sad, but it teaches the moral of the film. Life isn't about money or things, it's about family and spending as much time as we can with them because that's all we have that's worth anything.

1221949,4,B00000IBMC,"Once again, this is a movie in which the original is better than the re-make, even though the latter was a decent, popular film.

What the two films offered, however, was another stark contrast in how the culture (and Hollywood) has changed. In this original version, unlike today's films: 1 - The father rules the roost; 2 - the kids are nice kids. They actually behave and are respectful; 3 - The general atmosphere is a far more kind and gentle one than scene in today's ""family films.""

In other words, this is a real throwback to an era of nice family films, when they really were truly that. It reminded me of ""Life With Father."" If you liked that film, you'd enjoy this.

Clifton Webb was fun to watch as the strict father. Myrna Loy's role as the mother wasn't as much as one would expect. Perhaps if the title hadn't already been taken, this would have been more aptly named ""Life With Father"" since Loy's part was so minor. The kids were pretty wholesome and believable for that era except Jeanne Crain was far too old to be playing a 17-year-old.

If the film could be described in one word, it would be CHARM. It doesn't provide a lot of big laughs but it's pleasant, and at 86 minutes doesn't overstay its welcome.",1146009600,4,1227,4.44
1221950,5,B00000IBMC,"I must say that I was pleased with this version of the story.  I am a stickler for details and the producers of this film did a good job.  Although the last child is Jane and not Bob, and the butler/Jack-of-all-trades for the family was Tom and not Jim...this film is well worth watching.  It gives a ""true"" look into the lives and times of the Gilbreth family, and it is nothing like the newer hyped-up ""One"" and ""Two"" Cheaper By the Dozen versions that have recently hit the market.

This film portrays the family more as they were, growing up in the early teens and twenty's of the twentieth century.  The antics and hilarious lifestyle of how Frank and Lily raised their brood of children is closely correlated to the book by the same title.  Of course, the book is always better, and the book on cassette/CD version has a huge chunk of one chapter missing [Chinesee Cooking], I'd still recommend the book if you really want the true flavor of this remarkable family growing up in the early years of the twentieth century.

I would highly recommend this movie as a ""G"" family rating, and recommend that parents read not only this book to their children, but also the sequel, ""Bells on Their Toes.""  There are numberous other books by the various family members that are also worth reading although they are more difficult to lay hands on.

The Father, Frank, an eccentric but lovable genius, always wanted to have a dozen kids and his wish comes true.  He believes strongly in quality education, strict discapline, and especially time management.  It is funny to see him try to control all 12 kids at the same time. What I enjoyed most was seeing his eldest child, played by beautiful Jeanne Crain, change from being a mousy, obedient, old fashioned daughter into a strong, outgoing, opinionated young women. When her parents finally let her go to the school dance, she is thrilled except for the fact her dad insists on coming along.  At the dance she and her friends manage to losen him up a bit and he and his daughter become the most popular people at the dance.  My other favorite scene was when the kids managed to con their dad into getting an adorable dog.  I haven't seen the new ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" which came out a few years ago, and I have no desire to.  This one is great. However, the book is even better.

However, Fox, which has made so much money off this always popular film, should be taken to task for failing to give it the restoration it deserves. The color is a ghost of the originally-vibrant Technicolor so vividly displayed in other recent Fox restorations. Why this charming (and money-making) film has been denied such respect is inexplicable.",1118793600,5,562,5.119565217391305

This family was the Gilbreth's, and whether it be their quirky father and his efficiency, or just the overall mood of the family, America was ready for the Gilbreth's, and thankfully the movie matched the successful book.

For most, this will probably be just another old movie, so I plead at least read the book.  But if you do consider watching this film, then the worth is there.  This movie is short, entertaining, and even at times emotional.  In addition, the re-make, if you can call it that, is very un-related, so it does not fulfill the need for this movie, and there is some need.

So sit back, and be prepared to view an entertaining flashback into the 50's where life was simpler, although it took a whole lot of work to make it so.",1115942400,4,838,4.444444444444445

It might take awhile for the average modern viewer to get into it, though, since there really isn't much of a plot, not the way we've come to expect in modern movies, just a narration of various adventures the family had.  This is by far one of the best and most honest screen adaptations of a book I've yet seen, right up there with 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Fiddler on the Roof.'  However, screen adaptations of books being what they have to be due to time and money constraints, they naturally couldn't fit everything in, and so had to cut and paste some events from the book together so they wouldn't completely overlook the important stuff (and unlike many cut and paste jobs in other book-based movies, here it was done very tastefully instead of randomly and carelessly), and they did leave out a number of the funniest stories in the book, like Bill pushing the Chinese cook into the oven and the so-called interviews which ran in the paper, much to the family's horror that a lot of the things they supposedly said and did were made up to embarrass them.  They also got the birth order of the last two mixed up; Jane was the last-born child in real life, and Bob was the penultimate.  Still, given what passes for entertainment nowadays and how movies based on books usually bear little or no coherent resemblance to the story which the viewers know and love, this is a very clean and fun family movie.",1103932800,54,1654,4.555555555555555
1221959,3,B00000IBMC,"...though not a bad movie.

Like many of the other reviewers, I had seen this as a child and I had even read the book written by two of the children. Parts of it are very good, particularly the performance of my great favorite, Clifton Webb as Frank Gilbreth, efficiency expert and father of a dozen children.

Where it suffers are those parts that make it an ""old movie"", chiefly, the voice over narration of Jeanne Crain as the oldest daughter recollecting and introducing each episode. I wish they hadn't opted for that contrivance, because it's so much better when a script can just flow from scene to scene. That's where ""Life with Father"" starring William Powell is more successful, because even though it's rather episodic too, it comes off less so because there is no narrator.

After having seen the movie again last night after many years, I got into a conversation with my family about the mother's having gone on to become a major figure in motion studies and industial psychology. Well, when I got home, I did an internet search for her, Lillian Gilbreth, and found a wealth of information on her achievements, both before the husband's death and afterwards. This unexpected discovery made me disappointed further in the film, as there is an obvious bias towards the father's work and the mother is only mentioned as a helper. In point of fact, Lillian Gilbreth was a Ph. D (her husband had not attended college) and had a fifty year career AFTER his death during which she invented labor-saving devices like the step-on garbage can. How ironic that the Hollywood movie could not depict how extraordinary the mother really was--another indicator of a time when women's achievements were downplayed.

Be that as it may, audiences can still enjoy the movie as one of those ""large family with a large heart"" entries which ultimately maxxed out with ""Sound of Music"" or perhaps more appropriately, ""Yours, Mine, and Ours"". Good performances by the child actors, Myrna Loy as Mother, and again Clifton Webb doing a very out-of-character turn as a loving husband and family man. Very little of his signature Mr. Belvedere in this production, and even some hint of his first career as a song and dance man.",1097366400,12,2212,4.813157894736842

This version, which is actually based on the book, and actually tells a good story, is a classic.  It is told anecdotally, as the book is, and while it obviously contains less than the book, I like it better.  I grew up watching this movie, so it's deeply embedded in my mind.  This is truly a charming family movie, and a family movie in the truest sense of the word.  Not just a kids' movie, as most ""family"" movies are.  I think even very ""sophisticated"" film aficionados can appreciate the story, the charm, the characters, and the enduring themes of this one.

If you actually enjoyed the new version of ""Cheaper,"" hang your head in shame and do not buy this movie--you don't deserve to own it or see it.  It is not even in the same universe of films.  If you own the new one, perhaps you have a shot at redemption.  Shred the DVD, go out and buy 20 more copies of it, just to destroy them too.

1221962,5,B00000IBMC,"Cheaper By The Dozen is a wonderful recreation of American family life during the early days of the twentieth century.  Based on the best-selling biography of the same name, the narrative follows the adventures of the Gilbreth family headed up by father and mother Frank and Lillian (Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy), pioneers in the field of industrial engineering.  Between the two of them, they raised 12 children, including oldest daugher, Ann, (Jeanne Crain) who narrates the story.  Cheaper is Great entertainment for the whole family.  This ""fictionalized"" real story is a lot of fun, in the same way Life With Father is.  Webb has one of the best roles of his career as the exacting efficiency expert.  Myrna Loy glows with maternal warmth, and Jeanne Crain is lovely as always, struggling to grow up under the iron-fisted rule of a father born in the nineteenth century.  My only complaint with the DVD is the color is uneven in places, which is unfortunate.  This was a big budget production in its day and a lot of the wonderful Technicolor photography has been reduced to pinks and faded greens and blues.

1221968,5,B00000IBMC,"""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a tasteful and nostalgic classic film about the famous Gilbreath Family of industrial engineers who pioneered the field of time management. The setting is 1910-1920, when society and music were both more civil and tasteful. Just as in its equally classic cousin, ""Life With Father,"" timeless tunes like ""When You Wore A Tullip And I Wore A Big Red Rose,"" ""Sweet Genevieve"" and ""Just A Song At Twilight"" are highlighted. But most enjoyable is the acting of two Hollywood legends: the elegant and classy Myrna Loy and the vitriolic, pompous but loveable Clifton Webb. As the patriarch of the Gilbreath clan, Webb is his incomparably witty, acerbic self. Film fans should note that Hollywood tried to lure Webb back to Hollywood in the early talkie period (he had done some silents in the 1910s and 1920s) but he chose to remain the toast of the New York stage where he was America's greatest ballroom dancer twenty years before anyone ever heard of Fred Astaire. Webb returned to Hollywood in the early 1940s with his Academy Award nominated role of Waldo Lydecker in the classic ""Laura."" Webb was nominated again in his very next film for his superb portrayal of Elliot Templeton in ""The Razor's Edge."" His third talkie earned him a third consecutive Academy Award nomination-this time for Best Actor---in the hillarious comedy ""Sitting Pretty,"" which introduced Webb's timeless Mr. Belvadere character. Webb was an American treasure of stage, ballroom, and screen. Among other things, Webb made ballroom dancing (along with his equally talented partner, Bonnie Glass)the rage of the World War I era, was a operatic prodigy, introduced the white dinner jacket, and introduced classic Tin Pan Alley tunes like ""I'll Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan"" twenty years before Sinatra sang them. ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" serves as a great work of family entertainment that also illuminates an appreciable fraction of Webb's extraordinary talents.

Each child had their duties in the family and all of the movie was put together with laughter, personal situations and well rounded discipline.  When Dad went to the prom with his daughter and her date, I was reminded of how my Dad was when I was dating and how mortified I was at the time, but just like her Dad, she was made to feel very proud that he cared so much and was old-fashioned as Fathers should be.
