This is one of Douglas Fairbanks's last films, as with the coming of sound he quickly past his prime. It's an egodocument, in which Fairbanks presents his athletic, golfing and humurous self on a tour/holiday around East Asia. Most interesting (apart from Mickey dancing to Thai music) are shots of colonial Hong Kong, Fairbanks meeting the last absolute monarch of Siam, and Fairbanks shooting two leopards in North India. Images from another time, indeed.",1502409600,,634,4.87962962962963

8395819,5,B003F1Y29Q,"First, I have to confess that at the moment I'm totally into Doug Fairbanks. DVD's, books and all the other goodies. You name it. One film I was particularly curios about was ""Around the world in 80 minutes with Douglas Fairbanks"". To begin with it's one of the first travelogues and to close with it's Doug talking. I searched the Internet high and low for this movie and was at one moment disappointed since it was told the movie weren't to buy anywhere. But what I did found on this movie were reviews and not very flattering ones. The following adjectives have been used by the friendly critics to describe Doug's travelogue: patronizing, vulgar, not funny, rude, sad and so one. Read it by yourself the good pieces are still on the Internet. ;-)

But all my ""not available""-researches had one good point, there is a thing called Amazon and Amazon doesn't like the phrase ""not available"" (well sometimes :-) ). And at Amazon a very fine store called ""Grapevine Video"" (Everlasting gratitude guys. Luv ya!) was selling the DVD ""Around the world in 80 minutes with Douglas Fairbanks"". There is a God and he loves me! Bought it, received it, puh... How this movie is going to be? Because based on the reviews it's just a piece of junk featuring Doug Fairbanks... Well I watched and I loved it! It's just your favourite Doug Fairbanks being Doug Fairbanks. As for why he needed 78 minutes for an 80 minutes journey it's beyond me :-) He is funny, he is polite, he is witty. He's showing the usual tourist locations before the WWII. He is not about criticizing other cultures but showing them the way they were in 1931. I especially liked the Japanese girl needing 2 days to come down to breakfast and Doug having a fight with a tiger skin. After all it's Doug, he must save something or somebody. Btw. If I ever undertake a trip around the world I will most definitely pack a towel and a golf club. For you'll never know!

Love you Doug wherever you are!

P.S. Doug, just take that towel off!",1345593600,2,1992,4.527777777777778
