7969075,5,B00006HCP1,"Unfortunately I was unaware the DVD was region 2 (UK) but no matter- laptop DVDs are code-free and I was able to watch it.  I'm a big Britcom fan, love The Kumars at No. 42.  This is the predecessor, many of the same people, sketch comedy.  The cast (for both) are mainly of Indian extraction, and much of the humor has to do with British Indian indiosyncracies (like the couple Kapoor who pronounce their name Cooper) and stereotypes (the Jamaican talking Bhangramuffin teens), the father who insists everything and everyone is Indian (like the father in My BF Greek Weddding).  Some is biting, revealing the prejudices they deal with in ""white"" society.  The humor is universal; I'm an American of Irish extraction and it makes me laugh!",1202860800,4,739,4.78740157480315
