2258622,4,B0008EN6NG,"Normally, I should not think it necessary to revisit ""Original Sin.""  However, given the less than adequate sound engineering and the soft tones and trailing voice of Roy Marsden, it takes two or three hearing before one can clearly identify all of the dialogue. English subtitles for the non-Brits in the audience would make for a wonderful enhancement to this production. P.D. James writes with such intricacy of plot that she need not make the listener strain to catch the dialogue.  Overall I remain a fan, so I make the extra effort.",1178496000,4,538,4.836956521739131
2258623,5,B0008EN6NG,Excellent. Holds your interest until the end.,1406937600,,45,5.571428571428571
2258624,5,B0008EN6NG,James Marsden is perfect as the Inspector and I can't ask for more from a British mystery. It keeps my attention and I enjoy the story very much. Of course the music helps as well,1402617600,2,179,4.142857142857143
2258625,5,B0008EN6NG,Extremely suspenseful. Typical P.D. James excellence. Kept me in constant suspense and not wanting it to end.  Immediately wanted to read another.,1402531200,2,146,5.636363636363637
2258626,5,B0008EN6NG,"Dalgleish has such class and a no nonsense personality
when he is exposed to this murder, he handles it with
such pomp and he finds the killer the same way to the end
I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end --give it a try
after all PD James how can you go wrong",1361232000,3,265,3.8363636363636364
2258627,4,B0008EN6NG,"Original Sin is classic British mystery which I just happen to enjoy along with the work of P. D. James in particular. When you hear the famous theme music in the middle of the story, don't worry there's more coming; the DVD includes all three episodes that were aired in March and April of 1997. I'll admit, as others have observed, the story is somewhat involved but I found it held my interest

This particular DVD runs just under 2 and 1/2 hours so plan for a long evening. I had some difficulty playing this DVD on one player which wouldn't pick up any sound; I moved it over to another player and it all worked perfectly. Later I went back to the first player and tried two other discs and they both worked normally; I have no explanation for that.

Roy Marsden as Adam Dalgliesh turns in his customary effective performance joined by Ian Bannen and others in this P. D. James mystery. The story is nicely done for the most part although I'll agree that certain actions at the end of the movie strain credibility to some degree. These are not severe enough to compromise the story or the series in my opinion so I can recommend this DVD.",1310688000,6,1143,4.412322274881516
2258628,4,B0008EN6NG,"I did give some thought as to whether my high opinion of this episode wasn't due entirely to the beautiful setting in a Venetian palace reproduced in England. No, I think not: however, the layout sets the tone for the mystery, the juxtaposition of architecture of high art created to deal with the publication of books written and published for artistic reasons and the crass (as established by the play not me) desire of the young, new managing director to sell the building for the money to be made out of it and to publish only that which will sell, establishes the fundamental conflict out of which emerges murder. Unlike most of the earlier, longer episodes, the plot is hewed to clean lines, it proceeds in clear patterns from conflict, tension, murder, solution. The acting supports the cut-down script made from the customarily complex original book. Commander Dalgleish  is at his most humane and understanding. I commend the book as a good read.",1291766400,3,955,4.858895705521473
2258629,3,B0008EN6NG,"These mystery series movies just seem tom drag on and on.
I think that the director and producer should see the American movie
""Mystic River"" which covers and extended mystery
that involves history, but does it in a time economical fashion.
The acting is as usual very good, but these publishing house
murders are just not all that interesting
even with the weanie roast at the end?
If the case were striped to the basics of the investigation
the audience would be asleep by the end?
The two British inspectors can even get up enough energy to have a side romance.",1257120000,,564,4.594059405940594
2258630,4,B0008EN6NG,"I've been hard on a number of the P.D. James adaptations, but Original Sin is much better than those I've recently reviewed.  For one thing, it's shot on film and the production values are high.  The core concept--a publishing firm in a Venetian palace on the Thames in Wapping, with bodies piling up and sickness at the core--is clever and cinematic.  The supporting cast is strong, with fine performances by Amanda Root and Ian Bannen, and the laconic Dalgleish is in his element here.  London in general and the river in particular functions as a character in its own right and the atmospherics are good.  Plus, it's not as long as Hamlet and Lear combined, as some of the adaptations seem to be.  Other reviewers are correct: it would be helpful to have subtitles.  Still and all, it's worth seeing.",1246838400,4,803,4.692857142857143
2258631,1,B0008EN6NG,This DVD has no subtitles nor Close Captions. My native language is not English and it's difficult for me to follow it. I would like to know in the future when the DVDs you are offering have no subtitles.,1219017600,4,204,4.256410256410256
2258632,4,B0008EN6NG,"When Gerard Etienne, the high powered director of a publishing house turns up dead there are lots of suspects who had reasons to want him dead.  As one of the employees tells the police inspector, ""He wasn't a ray of sunshine.""  So, whodunit?  Was it Frances, the jilted spinster who still loved him, but hated the way he ran her family's business?  Was it Miss Blackett, his PA that he treated like a punching bag?  Could it be Claudis, his sister who wants the money she'll inherit only if he dies before his upcoming wedding?  And, the list of plausible suspects goes on.  There are lots of plot twists and turns that keep the viewer guessing up to the end.

The acting is superb, particularly on the part of James Wilby playing Gerard and Carolyn Pickles playing Miss Blackett.

So why didn't I give it five stars?  First, it was hard to believe there had ever been a relationship between the gorgeous, sophisticated  Gerard and the timid, frumpy Frances.  Perhaps this was a matter of casting a sexy, charismatic actor opposite a rather ordinary looking actress, or perhaps Gerard was supposed to have had an ulterior motive for the relaionship.  I suspect the latter, but it wasn't made clear by the script.

Second, I felt the murderer was treated with too much sympathy.  It's impossbile to explain this without giving away his motive.  I don't want to write a spoiler, so I'll leave it at just saying here is a person who killed three people during the course of the movie, and yet we are supposed to sympathize because of things that happened in the past.

Finally, there were certain plot lines that weren't adquately explained/explored.  For instance, what was going on in the relationship between Gerard and his father?  Why was Gerard so desperate to please his father, and why wasn't his father pleased?  How did certain people whose paths had crossed decades before happen to be working at the same publishing house.  I can't explain that without giving away the mystery, but I did wonder about it at the end.  I'm going to read the book, and hope that all the answers are in there.

Still, it's an intriguing story, involved, but easy to follow.  The acting is excellent, the sets are wonderful, the pace is good.  You will enjoy it, I am sure.",1211846400,9,2261,4.648989898989899
8055919,2,B0008EN6NG,"Really weak. The mystery is a mess, the last half hour a complete mess. Not entirely faithful to the book.
The earlier Marsden/Dalgleish series are better.",1482192000,,155,5.0
8055920,4,B0008EN6NG,"I recall watching Death of an Expert Witness on PBS, well it's OK seeing it again many years later very slow with lots of hysterical women. I prefer the book. Original Sin far better and more likable than the book. So this combo probably fits well together.",1472515200,,257,4.48936170212766
8055921,5,B0008EN6NG,"These are quite good. The P.D. James stories (which I originally saw on the now defunct PBS program ""MYSTERY!"") are well done psychological mysteries. However, they are quite dark and may not be to everyone's taste.",1457654400,,215,5.0
