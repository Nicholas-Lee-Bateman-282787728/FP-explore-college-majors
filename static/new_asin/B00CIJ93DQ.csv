5722769,4,B00CIJ93DQ,"First off, let me say that I have been a fan of Jackson's since his first album when he was performing at very small venues, like The Main Point (a small coffee house in Bryn Mawr, Pa. outside Philadelphia). I watched his rise to fame in the 70's and 80's, playing bigger and bigger venues as ""The Record Company"" tried to make as much money off of him as possible. I know and own all of his music, and have enjoyed all the different phases of this artist's career. I have varying opinions (like everyone else) of what I would have liked to seen him do, than what he has actually done. Which is why I have chosen to express my views on this particular dvd release. Jackson Browne is an intimate singer song writer, always is and always has been. Did he write some Incredibly Great Hits? You bet he did! But that alone does not define him. He is a much more complex artist than a ""Hit Making"" Rock & Roll Star. This dvd is a good example of the intimate side of him and his music(sometimes allowing the audience to express their impatience with the set list and the pace of the show). The 2012 tour was billed as an ""Acoustic Venue"" and the promoters tried to make it clear that if you were expecting an electric performance, this tour was NOT it. The consumer was informed of this before they bought tickets to his show. That is just what you get here on this dvd. Jackson and his Bandmates are very laid back here and are not trying to bring down the house. The song setlist is not a ""sing along"" of his greatest hits. But, if you are a long time fan like me you will really enjoy this show because all of his music is brilliant, especially the music that was not on the top of the charts. Now all that being said, I do have other opinions about the ""choice"" to release this side of him at this particular point in time. After 40 plus years of this artist's career, I personally would have liked to have seen a much more current and uplifting performance here. As far as I know, there are not any concert dvd's of Jackson Browne that are worth talking about out there. I find that to be very disappointing, because I personally don't see why there should not be alot more Live Performances of this guy especially after all of this time. It doesn't have to be a young Jackson. I kind of like the older more mature Jackson. I just think the show should have been a little more well rounded, and a little more exciting than what was released here on the ""I'LL DO ANYTHING"" DVD. Otherwise, the photograghy is very good. The sound is great. The musicians are excellent! And Jackson is very happy performing in this venue. If you are a fan you will probably love it. If you are a casual fan, I just wanted to try to explain what you are in for. Thanks!",1371600000,53,2747,4.264367816091954
5722770,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"Having seen Jackson Browne in concert many times, I doubt if any ""set list"" was ever repeated. He's too fluid and tuned in to his audience to let a list keep him from connecting with his fans. As a life-long fan, I don't measure the quality of his performance by what he choose not to do, I think it's more sensible to comment on what he presented to the audience. This concert was an hour and forty-five minutes of what I consider some of my favorite Jackson Browne tunes. Truth is, he didn't have enough ""Top 40 hits"" to play for an hour and a half. But his best stuff has always been the songs you never heard on radio. And this concert is loaded with his best stuff!
It's almost an acoustic performance, but he has enough solid backing here to do some of the things he hasn't done in a while, and do them well. If you're a true JB fan, you'll love it. If you're more of Top 40 person, try FM radio and get the same stale, dated tunes you apparently crave.
I purchased the Blu-ray, and the sound and picture are both superb. I came packed in one of those environmentally-friendly paper covers, but that's fine with me.",1371600000,36,1121,4.267605633802817
5722771,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"I recall an interview with Jackson (this was in the nineties) in which he says that touring becomes easier the longer you do it. He likened it to an old man playing racketball against a much younger man: the young guy flying around, slamming into walls trying to make impossible shots while the old guy, even though he seems to be barely moving, keeps winning because all of the various angles and trajectories are so ingrained. So it is with this performance captured last November in Denver, and originally broadcast on Axs.  A beautifully lit stage covered with huge area rugs create a living room atmosphere, and from the moment he steps out, Jackson becomes the welcoming host, taking requests, bantering with the sold-out arena as if everyone there are friends he's known for decades; and in a very real sense he has, just as they've known him.  Since 1972 his songs have provided solace and meaning for so many of us who came of age during one of the most confusing and tumultuous periods in our nation's history.  Love, loss, war, social upheaval...it's not an overstatement to say that Jackson's words, voice and music provided those of us who cared enough to listen an indelible, indispensable resource for processing the pain, longings and fear those times.  But this is far from a history lesson.  Jackson Browne's songs carry in them timeless truths and themes that are just as, if not more relevant today as they were when we were questioning our wars, our leaders, our hearts and dreams.

Throughout the concert, Jackson deftly mixes and matches the support of guitarists Val McCallum and Sean Watkins, drummer Mauricio Lewak, bass, keyboardist Tyler Chester and, of course, the violin and beautiful voice of opener, Sara Watkins. (Note: Watkins' opening set is not included in this release.)

One reviewer has questioned Jackson's fluid, relatively obscure set list, and while it's true that many of his best known songs are not performed here, it's really nothing less than a measure of how deep and rich Jackson Browne's catalog is. For me and for the audience (based on their responses), hearing ""Black and White ('86), The Late Show ('74) and A Child in These Hills ('72) made the evening just that much more special . Jackson Browne is not and never has been a ""hit-maker"" or an ""oldies"" act.  And as those of us who have seen this DVD, or who see him on tour in the coming months will attest, Jackson Browne the performer is as ageless and timeless as his extraordinary catalog of songs.",1371600000,85,2509,4.791666666666667
5722772,2,B00CIJ93DQ,This could have been great but check out out song list if u can. TOO MANY great tunes missing to make this a classic it could have been! Yo Jackson- U ain't getting any younger pal!  Expected and assumed more...........,1371513600,5,219,4.475
5722773,4,B00CIJ93DQ,Jackson lays out his take on life in a serise of songs that expose his genius. Acoustic plus with little intros and much soothing strumming. Excellent sound and non-jittery camera work.,1371513600,12,185,5.0

5722777,3,B00CIJ93DQ,"Good mellow Jackson, what you'd expect.  His catalog of songs are so solid and beautifully written, they carry themselves. Remarkable and great listening every time, his voice remains pure and perfect. Enjoyed his band very much too, good camaraderie and stage presence, very enjoyable!  Good quality DVD and visually appealing. I only gave it 3 stars because it's exactly what you expect from Jackson, but I would like to see another disk come out where he rocks the house a little more between ballads - Running on Empty with a driving band behind him - then I'd give it 4 or 5 stars for greater balance.  But this disk and concert performance is really great as is - definitely keeping and will play again and again.",1463184000,,719,4.690476190476191
5722778,3,B00CIJ93DQ,"Pros - You get to watch one of the best songwriters of our times sing his songs.  Seriously, his song lyrics are pure genius.

Cons -
1. The sound quality is not that great.
2.  His voice has changed with age.  He doesn't hit the high notes and his voice isn't as clear as it was.  This is most noticeable on the old familiar songs, where you mind remembers how he sang those notes in his prime.
3.  No close-ups.  You can't see his facial expressions or his eyes very well.
4.  To say his show is low-key is a huge understatement.  He just sits there and sings.  He's only a fair emcee.

Conclusion  - This was interesting to watch once, but I will probably just go back to listening to his CDs.",1462924800,3,696,4.150375939849624
5722779,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"Great music and DVD.  Some of the songs were not exactly like the recorded version, which is actually better....because it's different.

5722784,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"a Jackson Browne show isn't like your average concert. You pay attention to the lyrics and the way he delivers them. If you know these songs, and I do, you hang on every word. If you don't, each song opens like a new book and tells a story that rivets. If you want to swing and sway to anthems, this isn't your show ( the closest he gets is ""Take It Easy"" which everyone knows and sings along ) this is a show that requires and rewards an emotional investment. I love this man and his music, so I'm a sucker for this DVD. Great band, great songs and a fabulous experience all around. As far as this not having a 5.1 mix, who cares ? In the end, you only have two ears. Use them to enjoy these mesmerizing songs.",1454284800,,711,4.049645390070922

5722801,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"OMG where do I begin? I love this DVD. Jackson Browne, Val McCallum, and Fritz Lewak are one organism when they are playing together. They are simply the best when the 3 of them are together. I feel almost sacriligious saying this (in deference to JB who is in a class all of his own), but if for no other reason buy it to see Val play guitar. They are ALL masters but this particular DVD shows Val in his mastery. Other DVDs (Going Home) show Lewak in his. Browne is always in his. I love JB's humor; his soft spokeness; his choice of songs on this particular DVD. God, I would have given most to be present at this concert. This is beautiful - art in true form. There is nothing else to say. Buy it and love it.",1422576000,,713,4.1

5722813,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"I loved it.  Sets a warm and gentle mood.  Excellent lyrics.  Wonderful rapport with band members.  Very sincere, mostly uplifting, with the familiar Jackson Brown personal touch.  He touches my soul and lifts me up.  I would follow him to the end of the earth.  I have been a fan since shortly after The Velvet Underground through all his music, moods,and melancholy music  through to the present.  So often I have felt he was singing my life, my pain and deepest thoughts and feelings.  When I listen to him I go into an intensely personal place.  I love the way he sings about his personae pain and his sardonic sense of humor. There are few artists as deeply open with their personal experiences.  The band members were absolutely perfect and in sync with him.  Listening to his song has long been one of my most consuming passions.  Now to to have this DVD is close to heaven!!!",1412121600,2,883,4.54140127388535

5722819,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"If you are in any way a Jackson Browne fan, this is a real must concert. It is a very well produced show of a Denver concert in 2012, and give you the best of Jackson's songs along with a very good support group ( who are able to display some of their own material) that make for a great evening of great music and great performance. I do love this performance, and as a decades long Jackson fan, you will get your money's worth fully by purchasing this. Hope you do, hope you enjoy.",1402012800,,483,4.094736842105263

8:00 pm sharp he walks on stage; acknowledges and crowd, and begins a solid set.
While he didn't play all my favorites on this Bd (how would that be possible in a single concert?) he played enough of them to make this Blu-ray ""momento"" of a wonderful evening a must own.

I own every Jackson Browne CD, and a quasi-autobiographical DVD entitled, ""Coming Home,"" also purchased from Amazon.  My husband and I attend every CJB concert that we can, even making some ""Destination Vacations"" to coordinate when he is going to be performing there.  We're from NJ, and we drove to Baltimore for a lovely 5 day get-away after I had purchased great seats for Jackson's concert in the Baltimore Wharf District.  Lovely city, great restaurants, but most importantly, a phenomenal concert by the ""Take It Easy Kid"" himself.

His choices are interesting, and they allow fans to hear very good versions of songs they might not expect to hear (Farther On, Live Nude Cabaret, I'd Do Anything, and The Late Show, among others).  Sara Watkins' vocals and fiddle work add greatly to many of the arrangements.  Browne is an arrangement perfectionist, and this DVD is no excepton.  Well worth the while of Jackson Browne enthusiasts.",1377907200,5,528,4.769230769230769

5722853,4,B00CIJ93DQ,"This is the first blu-ray live concert of Jackson Browne and the first such opportunity (blu-ray which are few and far between)  for audiences to hear his full retinue of hits.  Quixotically, he chose to perform a quirky  set consisting of whatever, I guess,  he felt like playing that night. Half of his hit songs were not on the set list including Doctor My Eyes.  What he did play was excellent and the videography was high quality. I would buy the Blu-ray again for what hits he hits he was willing to grace us with.  Browne's voice is still strong and his songs great to listen to.

Browne complained (gratuitously) about the fact the performance was being filmed and was forced to sheepishly respond to a member of the audience why he had what appeared to be a 50 more more guitars sitting behind him on stage, a veritable music store of them. No wonder he wrote a song about overworked roadies.

This is a $20.00 blu-ray.  One would have expect Browne to perform at least 2 hours and better 2.5 hours like similar live BD albums Genesis, CNN and Elton John.  This would have been enabled him to sing a lot more of his hits. A missed opportunity.",1376697600,2,1152,4.4688995215311005
5722854,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"I've followed JB since his first LP ""Saturate Before Using"" and have seen him in concert 4 times, absolutely phenomenal live. This BD is no exception on concert performance, probably better now than ever, not to take any thing away from his old band mates. The picture quality is excellent too, crisp, clear, and focused from my OPPO BDP-105. Every thing about this BD is perfect and right on the money, EXCEPT the audio, it is stereo 2.0 only! The sound quality of the 2.0 is very clean and detailed but lacks the .1 for the sub. This is most notable when he plays the piano and is a little thin on the bottom, as well as the rest of the bass.  A concert Blu-ray with 2.0 sound ONLY is like having a Ferrari that is governed at 55 mph, lots of show but no go! It seems to me that JB is not a big fan of making concert recordings as this is the only official all concert recording he has out. His ""Going Home"" DVD is just short concert clips and has no complete song on the whole disc! What's that! This would be a truly amazing recording but falls short of providing that concert experience at home. I understand the whole purest stereo concept, but also the surround benefits, especially on concert recordings. It's a shame that who ever made this decision made it with no or little regard for those who like surround sound, and to not even give an option? Must be a soundbar owner or have a poor audio system. I will say again that the audio that IS there is very clean and detailed so it's better than a lot of crappie 5.1 DD concerts out there. It's worth owning and is a great concert regardless. Read my comment to a reply.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating system, that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance: *****
2. Quality of Audio: ***** (subtract 1 for audio options): ****
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's): *****

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry, the band or others justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1376438400,3,2259,4.423076923076923

My one issue-- and it's a big one-- is why in the world, given the 2012 performance and 2013 release, is state of art audio technology not used.  No surround sound whatsoever-- not DTS and not even digital 5.1 surround sound?  Quite honestly, this is embarrassing, as the audio experience could have been so much better.  For this reason alone I cannot in good conscience give this a review of better than 3 stars, though I thoroughly enjoyed the concert performance itself.",1374969600,4,594,4.851485148514851

5722861,3,B00CIJ93DQ,"I must stress that the concert performance itself is stupendous! I saw Jackson on this same tour at another venue and it was a fantastic night. I've seen him a few times and this is the best he's ever been. If you can't catch him live, this is a perfect representation of the kinds of shows he's playing these days: relaxed, emotional and revealing.

My score is concerned with the presentation, and the presentation is terrible even by my very low standards. The packaging itself is a nice cardboard digipack, but it's plastered with VCD-quality screen captures. Jackson looks like Max Headroom. That little thumbnail preview you see on Amazon is doing it a lot of favors. The video presentation of the Blu-ray itself is amazing - I'm mystified as to why they didn't just capture a frame from the pristine BD transfer!

And not that it's a huge deal, but a number of songs from this Denver concert were cut: ""Call It a Loan"", ""Looking East"" and ""For a Dancer"". In this era of ample Blu-ray storage space, there's no need to cut 3 killer songs off the set (and PS, they're not available as extras (PPS, there are no extras)).

But, to be fair, that's all pretty trivial. The 800-pound gorilla is the audio presentation - and for a concert film, audio presentation is *everything*. Do you have a gorgeous 60-inch plasma screen and state-of-the-art BD player? Good for you, because apparently Inside Recordings thought that if you sprang for all that fancy shit, there's no way you would have purchased a halfway-decent speaker system.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the only concert Blu-ray currently in existence that features a stereo soundtrack ONLY. I have concert DVDs from *1996* that completely lack a stereo option. I was stunned - the music is amazing, a treasure! Why mix a concert BD as if you plan to hook your TV up to an old boombox?

This is a like a Frankenstein's Monster of first-gen VHS audio fidelity mixed with cutting-edge HD visuals. Brilliant artist. Great tour. Embarrassing Blu-ray.",1374537600,11,2012,4.7535816618911175

I have been waiting for years for Jackson to put out an acoustic DVD so I jumped on this the moment I saw it.  I was shocked when it arrived and I found that it was recorded in Dolby 2.0!!!  It's like listening to a VHS tape from the 80s.  All of the sound is channeled through your center speaker, with absolutely no ""presence"".  Even his ""Going Home"" DVD from 2000 is in 5.1.

If it was Dolby 5.1 you could actually feel like you were at the concert, but instead you have to put up with very muted sound.  I thought that this could bring back some memories from when we sat front row at one of his concerts, but there is no ""presence"" or clarity at all to this disk.  Can't believe they produced this in 2012.  So disappointing.",1374105600,20,875,4.124260355029586

They did have their moments, but over all I would have much rather seen JB release a DVD of him doing one of his Solo Acoustic Tour shows. I've been a JB fan since his very first tour which I saw him at and have seen him at least 2 dozen times since. I've never seen a bad show and this DVD is no exception. If your a fan and buy this, you'll know what I mean. If this is your first time seeing JB, then you won't be seeing him at his best and it's not him that's bad. All in all I still enjoyed this DVD as did my wife who is just as big a fan as me. Just buy it. It's worth the money.",1373328000,2,755,3.6666666666666665

5722873,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"I've been a fan of Jackson Browne's from the time of his first album. For a frame of reference, Late For the Sky is my favorite album of his with The Pretender as the runner up.

Regarding song selection, some reviews were critical because it was not a ""greatest hits"" collection. Well, I think the song selection is just fine; with so many excellent works, there will always be disagreement as to which songs should have made it to the disc. So it doesn't have ""Somebody's Baby.""  Well, too bad, eh?  I am happy that there is Blu Ray concert available for Mr. Browne and that it's a solid performance.

Video-wise, the picture is fine. I buy concert Blu Rays more for the audio and not the video so I'll just say that I didn't detect anything that doesn't look right.  It's tastefully done and the picture quality is good.

Audio-wise, the sound is excellent. It is recorded in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 96K.  Some have lamented the fact that there is no surround soundtrack, only two channel and while I would have liked to have had the option of surround, I didn't really miss it since the stereo track is so good. Instruments are well-placed and defined in the mix and everything is clear. I found I had to turn up the volume higher than normal but perhaps that is because it is 2 versus 5 channels.

Performance-wise, Mr. Browne is very much at ease with the audience and looks totally comfortable during the show. So does his backup band. His age shows more in his face than his voice. He's still able to hit the higher notes like he did on the originals and doesn't have to sing alternate ones instead, and his voice is still unmistakably that of Jackson Browne.  If you are a fan of his, then I highly recommend this disc.",1372896000,8,1721,4.438095238095238
5722874,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"This review is for the Blu Ray format which also plays on Region B players. The negative reviews are interesting and fall into two areas being NOT ENOUGH HITS and NO SURROUND SOUND.Well I was curious to see what songs he performed at this concert actually made it onto his  double best of album `The Very Best Of Jackson Browne'  released in 2004. Of the sixteen original songs performed on this Blu Ray nine songs were on the previously mentioned  `Best of' so I consider that a very generous selection from someone who really only gets `Running on Empty' and `Somebody's Baby' played on the radio these days. Jackson is still writing ,recording and performing wonderful music as this concert shows,it's just that radio doesn't play it and hasn't done since the 1980's so how can it become popular if nobody but the real fans who buy his stuff ever get to hear it. What you get here is a fine selection of songs covering his entire career. It starts off quite low key so be patient as it builds in intensity especially when Sara and Sean Watkins join him about five songs in.

As for the lack of 5.1 surround I was surprised that a new release blu ray would only be in stereo. But right from the start I honestly did not miss the extra channels. The vocals were right in the centre in the mix and the clarity of each instrument is excellent. A nice deep ,warm bass coming through the subwoofer. Do not put off buying this blu ray for this reason. The clarity of the image is also very good for a concert with quite a lot of blue lighting on stage.

What's not to like here. A great artist still at the top of his game. Also check out the documentary `Going Home'.",1372723200,6,1664,4.372168284789644

All I can say is, ""See (complainers) what you have done?! You have now helped feed right into Amazon being able to make the product only available from their third party sellers, thus causing people to have to pay more for it!! Do you really think, after the factory has already produced thousands of copies of this Blu-ray, that they're going to discard them, go back to the drawing board, and produce it all over again with surround sound?! If you do, you're living in la-la-land (and even if they eventually do so, in the meantime people who want to buy it now, and who would buy it as it is now offered, are unable to obtain it without having to pay more for it, or being satisfied with buying it in DVD format and missing out on getting it with the HD quality video in Blu-ray, and probably HD quality audio as well)!! As a result, you have now caused many people to suffer for this product no longer being sold directly by Amazon at a (far?) more affordable price!!""

However, I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray disk because it did not come with surround sound.  I bought my first surround sound system and HD TV just to watch and listen to The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DVD in DTS surround. Since then I have upgraded my system several times and own over 100 music/concert DVDs and Blu Rays and I play them every night. I was stunned to discover that this Blu Ray is stereo only. I spent 30 minutes trying to get to play in surround.  It did not say that on the Amazon site and does not say that on the package. Virtually every other music/concert DVD I have has the option of being played in one or more surround sound formats. I love the music, but would have just bought the CD if I had known this was only in stereo. No need to get the Blu Ray.",1372291200,10,897,4.005586592178771
5722877,5,B00CIJ93DQ,"I hate to sound like everyone else when I say I've seen Jackson Browne in concert many times over the past 35 plus years.  I was lucky to catch on at the time his second record (For Everyman) was current, and so for many years have enjoyed his talent.  Late For The Sky is surely one of the most important records of the historic era of stereo records/rock and roll/FM radio.  By purchasing and listening to his records, I can confirm that there are many great songs in his catalog.  But saying so, I'm no more qualified to rate this dvd concert than any other fan.

I ordered it a couple days ago, it arrived yesterday, I watched it last night.  I last saw him in concert a couple years ago when he was touring solo/acoustic/small venues.  This concert is more recent, with a complimenting group of younger musicians backing him up.  Like many older fans probably feel, there's no substitute for David Lindley in my opinion for the violin/pedal steel flavor of the early Jackson Browne records.  In this dvd, these younger back-up players allow the older songs to be re-visited with a familiar, yet fresh, presentation.  There's a violin player, an electric guitar soloist, and a acoustic guitarist that each provide a partial tribute to David Lindley's original contributions.  They're not the same, but it works pretty well.

As a particular example, ""A Child In These Hills"" is a song from the 1972 debut Jackson Browne album.  If you are truly a fan, then you know the record, and you know this cut is not one of his radio hits.  This dvd concert includes this song, with a slightly different rhythm and presentation as compared to the album version.  It's a highlight of the dvd.  It's great, and if it had sounded like this 40 years ago, it would have rivaled Doctor My Eyes or Rock Me On The Water as a radio hit.  I had the same sensation with the dvd version of ""Naked Ride Home"".  While only slightly different in rhythm, I much prefer it to the original album version.

Jackson Browne is known for, and greatly admired by many for, his melancholy lyrics.  This dvd concert represents that characteristic of his catalog.  But there's upbeat feeling as well.  ""Running On Empty"" is well done here.  Really, it's all very well done.  I can't see anyone complaining about the selection of songs included in this particular evening concert.  This man is a music talent phenomenon.  This dvd entertainment is well worth the dollar expense.  His earlier dvd title, ""Going Home"" is also very good.  I've never been disappointed in any investment of time or expense in Jackson Browne.  If he happens to ever read this review, I'd like to say how sincerely grateful I am to him for the contribution he made to my happiness and understanding in life.",1372204800,25,2751,4.63768115942029

I have also seen him in concert several times over the years. This concert video is a very accurate account of his singing and songwriting abilities. The setlist appeals to both the casual fan and long time hard-core fan.(yours truly) He deftly mixes easily recognized songs( the pretender,running on empty) with more obscure,deep cuts from his catalog.(a child in these hills,i'll do anything)
This video shows him very much at ease and also re-energized as he connects with the younger and very talented musicians around him. They seem to thoroughly enjoy playing JB's songs along with him.

Jackson Browne has been my favorite artist since his very first album in 1972, and I own everything he's ever recorded.  I've attended countless JB concerts in every venue imaginable, from large stadiums to small clubs.

Most of my other favorite artists released Blu-ray concert videos years ago, and it's been a long wait to finally have Jackson on Blu-ray.

While I appreciate live concert videos, the true benefit of Blu-ray is in the audio.  Instead of having to listen to crummy, compressed, two-channel, CD-quality audio, Blu-ray offers true fidelity with multi-channel Dolby surround or DTS digital playback.

When I loaded the Jackson Browne Blu-ray disc, I didn't see a menu option to select surround sound.  What?  They actually released this Blu-ray with 2 channel stereo only!

I have many, many Blu-ray concert videos and this is the ONLY disc that's ever come with stripped-down two-channel audio.  How could they do this?  I've seen the mixing boards at JB's concerts and every mic is recorded in a separate track.  I can only assume that Jackson did not want the public to have access to a high-quality recording because it may cut into his concert sales.

5722883,3,B00CIJ93DQ,this concert tour was too long and the opening act was tedious and too long.  We left half way through J. Browne's show as it lacked spark and had too few hits.  So I bought the blu-ray version of the concert and thankfully no opening act but it is still kind of a downer.  We like J Browne but there is a sameness and subdued quality that makes us sleepy,1371686400,6,355,4.042857142857143
8582039,4,B00CIJ93DQ,"this is almost perfect! I do have a gripe about the quality of this dvd. there are too many noticeable gaps in the audio. its like its skipping. I'd much rather prefer a blue ray. I'm willing to pay a few more dollars for a blue ray and skip-free audio. I wasn't familiar with his back up crew especially Sarah Maclachlin. The violin definitely adds to the exquisite,homey, and relaxing and enjoyable recording that Jackson Browne created.",1517270400,,439,4.714285714285714

Filmed in a great room -- the Paramount -- in Denver",1502668800,,255,4.163265306122449

8582048,1,B00CIJ93DQ,"This is not about Jackson Browne. This is a DVD of one of the most annoying drummers I have ever had the displeasure to watch. You would think he is still playing for some' stadium big haired group.' On top of that the sound for everyone, including the amplified applause, is great for everyone except Mr. Browne and his piano. Just incredible! You are overwhelmed by the entire band but the great artist that you are paying to see and hear is often barely audible. I do not understand why the artist allowed this awful DVD to be marketed. If you have ever heard this incredible performer perform when it is just him, his piano and a great steel guitarist; on a stage with lighting where you can actually see the performers you will hate this DVD. The lighting is a throw back to the early sixties and obviously run by someone still stoned. It is often so dark I wonder how the artists see their instruments. Why Mr. Browne insists on playing with a band is beyond me. Even on many of his albums they drown him out. Too bad for one of the greatest performers of our time.",1479513600,4,1071,4.36
