2697910,1,B000KWZ7VU,Quite a disappointment.  Barenboim's Beethoven Piano Concertos are just extraordinary.  The sonatas... do not sound like Beethoven,1197763200,5,130,6.588235294117647
2697911,5,B000KWZ7VU,"We should be deeply grateful to EMI and Maestro Barenboim for providing us with this treasure. The inclusion of the masterclasses are valuable not only in terms of performance but also and especially because of the profound insights into the music Barenboim provides in the course of his critiques. These insights are nothing short of a basic philosophy of Beethoven and of life. One is left with the impression that playing and studying Beethoven his whole life had the effect of helping make Barenboim the person is today. Through Beethoven's music Barenboim is an artist who helps us feel this great poet's insights into himself and human nature and does so in a way that is most affecting.
My suggestion would be to go to the masterclasses first and then listen to Barenboim's performances after. The performances themselves are exciting, passionate and persuasive. It is impossible not be in awe of the intelligence and humanity of Beethoven as realised by Maestro Barenboim.",1195689600,9,980,5.055555555555555
2697912,5,B000KWZ7VU,"The DVD Barenboim on Beethoven is one of the very best DVDs I have ever owned.
A great investment especially if you are trying to introduce wonderful music to a young person.  Also it is a DVD you are able to watch over and over again for many years.  The Master classes are excellent, and the concerts given by Mr. Barenboim are just wonderful to say the very least.

Of course I must add that I am a fan of Mr Barenboim, Lang Lang and of course Beethoven.",1195084800,8,457,4.170454545454546
2697913,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Fabulous.  Beautiful.  Brings out the beauty, the emotion, the power of the sonatas.  If you are a piano player, you will soon be buying a collection of Beethoven's sonatas to play on your own.  Shows you just how amazing and beautiful the sonatas can be.",1188345600,4,255,4.6
2697914,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Appart of the obvious supreme performances, the masterclasses reveal the concrete motives of Barenboim generic success. He is an extremely intelligent person and it's difficult to immagine other pianist capable to express the ideas he gives to the young pianists and the public. I do not buy DVD's because I feel that the 'poietic' perspective of music performance is lost with the always the same visual figures, but this album is a cultural jewell that no  reallly art lover could loose.",1186185600,6,489,5.037037037037037
2697915,5,B000KWZ7VU,"It is one thing to listen to the Beethoven Sonatas, another to experience Bqarenboim's recreation of this epic soundworld.  His interpretations transcend technique.

2697916,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Here is a set that is, and will be for future generations, priceless. If it cost twice as much it would still be worth it, and a great deal.

The complete traversal (in recital) of the Beethoven 32 has been done a number of times since Sir Charles Hall first accomplished the mammoth task in 1861, but never before has it been caught on film.

Maestro Barenboim is completely up to the task. Having played many of the Sonatas for more than fifty years one is not surprised at his great insights and seriousness, but almost shockingly (when one thinks of how much time he spends with his ""non-pianistic"" activities) he is also still up to all the considerable technical and endurance demands.

The recitals are filled to the brim with moments of insight, beauty, profundity, joy, power and greatness that are too numerous to mention. Even the occasional interpretive choice that I find puzzling (the decidedly not ""Allegro molto e vivace"" from Sonata no. 13 jumps to mind) does nothing to diminish any of the concerts, no one will ever be able to play all 32 in a way that pleases everyone, it would be folly to even attempt to do so. Instead Barenboim does exactly what he should (unsurprisingly); he plays with great knowledge and understanding, leaving nothing to chance. It would be impossible for me to recommend this any more highly to anyone interested in the Piano, Beethoven or Music.",1177286400,39,1392,4.720164609053498
2697917,5,B000KWZ7VU,"If any contemporary pianist can be said to ""own"" the Beethoven piano sonatas, it is Daniel Barenboim.  This is his third traversal of the complete sonatas, and by any standard, this latest is his greatest effort - bringing the distillation of a lifetime of living with this music that he has been playing since he was eight years old.  In the end, one comes away from these concerts with a renewed appreciation for the range, creativity, genius and sheer daring of Beethoven as a composer.

The sonatas are presented in a series of eight concerts, often with selections from each of Beethoven's early, middle and late years.  For example, the first concert presents three sontatas - numbers 1, 18 and 29 (the Hammerklavier).  In addition, there are two bonus disks with Barenboim presenting a series of 55-minute master classes with six talented young pianists, each of whom plays a movement from one of the Beethoven sonatas and then Barenboim offers his observations and suggestions, often illustrating his point by playing on his own piano. He comments on a wide range of topics - the sonata at hand, music in general, piano playing and its special demands, life in general - replete with occasional anecdotes and stories.  He takes questions from the audience at the end of each session.

For anyone who loves great piano playing, this set is a must.",1176422400,42,1354,4.860869565217391
2697918,5,B000KWZ7VU,"It is truly unbelievable what Daniel Barenboim did in the lapse of three weeks in these 8 concerts given in Berlin in 2005, what a precious gift to be able to watch these superb performances of the complete Beethoven 32 Piano Sonatas in wonderful sound and image and a really beautiful camera work, it takes more than eleven hours to play them all, Daniel Barenboim is an extraordinary musical genius, not to mention the superb quality of his playing and the fact that he didn't even read a single note.
I really didn't know Daniel Barenboim is such a fantastic pianist, his playing in this set is simply unsurpassable, he shows a deep feeling and connection with this music, his understanding of the music and the piano in particular is totally amazing and that is completely reflected in the unique way he plays, he is never boring, his interpretations are so vivid, each phrase played with such care and passion, his musicality and expressiveness are outstanding, and his technic is absolutely of the highest level, truly astonishing, it was like the piano was actually singing all the time.
This whole set is a magnificent masterclass, truly in the same league with the greatest masters of the piano ever.
The format of the film is widescreen and for the audio we have the option of Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround for optimal sound.
So if you love the piano and feel passion for it do not miss these magnificent, spellbinding, breathtaking and electrifying performances beautifully captured on film.",1175990400,86,1499,4.859375
2697919,5,B000KWZ7VU,"THIS is what I'm talkin about! A fantastic collection with more magnificent playing from Barenboim. The chap's hitting his stride! Having just watched the excellent 2disc '50 Years on Stage', I went looking for more. This is a superb film (6 discs) and Barenboim's Beethoven is wise and abundant - and the film's not just music. Conversation, breezy cutaways, but always returning to the reason for the season, which is Barenboim's musical maturity and his seeming emergence as a revered elder. In the Master Class segments, Barenboim even manages to get Lang Lang to LISTEN more! Young musicians have a great deal to learn from the maestro in this phase of his musical life: learning to lean on music, to trust it, to set aside ego inside one's work, and how to listen as a musician. These pure qualities this pianist possesses in spades. Absolute recommendation. How many times can you hear these sonatas played with this kind of beautiful authority? Dont even think twice. Worth twice the price.",1174953600,60,998,4.911242603550296
2697987,5,B000KWZ7VU,These performances are superbly done wih great care and much thought.  This is a must-have set for anyone with an interest in Beethoven's piano sonatas.  Sound and video quality are excellent.,1289692800,,192,5.161290322580645
2697988,5,B000KWZ7VU,Barenboim on Beethoven is a great collection.  Barenboim's eight concerts including all Beethoven piano sonatas is a source of endless pleasure for the classical piano lover.  And the Masterclasses are not only incredibly insightful but also present a new generation of great pianists. The whole ensamble leads the viewer to the depths of Beethoven's dialectical metaphysics. As Barenboim puts it: This is Absolute Music.,1284336000,2,421,5.5625
2697989,1,B000KWZ7VU,"I have always thought that Daniel Barenboim has all along been overrated as a pianist, since the early 1970's.
True that he is a 'star' pianist; with all the associations with his former wife and all the stories; but frankly, apart from that, he has never attained maestro status in the strict sense of the word. He has crossed over to conducting this last decade, and his performance at the keyboard rightfully and logically diminished even further in terms of luster and style.
These Beethoven sonatas, whatever you might call it, is in no way satisfying in that they are rather graceless and glacial all in one.
Graceless in that the pianist seems not to pay heed to the sonics but just concentrates on the pyro-techniques. Nowhere could you find a more ponderous sounding set of Beethoven sonatas: just listen to the end of each phrase, each harmonic structure. May be he has a reason for this, but I find the blurring and the clamouring very much distasteful, and could under no circumstances imagine that these are the composer's wishes.
One saving aspect of this set is the 'master classes' - interesting, though you doubt if it is really that instructive.",1241481600,14,1163,4.791044776119403
2697990,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Excellent. Playing 32 Beethoven sonatas in few concerts  it is just incredible, it is live concert, then you cant expect 100% of perfection, but I recall one  Barenboim concert in Valencia, he was playing Liszt, it was amazing, one of the best concert of my life. You were there or not .These DVDs are for people that didn't have the  choice to be in Berlin to enjoy  these 8 concerts. We can loose long time discussing how Beethoven sounds (neither Beethoven new how it sound it self ) or expend your time listening  to this great job (gift) from Barenboim. You will find an ""old"" Barenboim enjoining  his playing and playing for himself, nowadays  he don t have anything to demonstrate. He is a Master.
There are many ways to understand music, this is not for people that think that music is a competition, or a race or they expect the pianist to be like a monkey in a circus. This is for people who believe that music is written and played for soul an feelings. I really like many piano players, but  Barenboim  contribution on classical music  is it s just great.
There will be only  one Barenboim....just how he performs last movement of  Tempest  he deserves immortality.

8 great concerts,  32 sonatas ,  a moment of music, a gift.  Enjoy it.",1228521600,6,1249,4.5291479820627805
2697991,4,B000KWZ7VU,"First off Im not a musician, what I say is like 90% of the reviews, just plain old subjective opinions based on individual taste. I do however have several recordings that I listen to quite often by the major interpreters and I find Barenboims in the middle of the pack on most of my favorites. Im not 100 positive but many times it sounds like he hits wrong notes in the harder sonatas and is unsure of himself at times also as can be expected as it seems he conducts more than he does virtuoso work. (I almost feel stupid saying anything bad about a performer of this caliber when I struggle with chop stix) That being said there is nothing that should stop you from buying these they are done well, a lot of camera angles although sometimes I wish they'd show the hands more. The sound is more than adequate, the tone of the steinway is very nice.  Many times while listening on CD I wonder what the hands are doing so this is so great to see live, however Im sometimes dissapointed when they show Daniels face while playing a part that I wanted to see, oh well can't have everything I guess.  This is so great to have that it makes the bad seem almost irrelevant. The thing that I do appreciate is that each concert has early, mid and late works so you can hear your faves through out each DVD.  Overall you most likely won't be dissapointed, I'm a happy Beethoven fan right now.",1220659200,10,1383,4.311538461538461
2697992,5,B000KWZ7VU,"This is what barenboim was born to do,its amazing how much better he is on the piano than conducting,from the first sonata to the last he masters them all,my favorite is the waldstein. I think hes always had a great understanding of beethoven even his conducting some of his symphonys, but this set is among the finest on disc.",1217721600,2,327,4.559322033898305
2697993,5,B000KWZ7VU,"If you study every piece before - read more information about each sonata before you list - it gets greater and greater. - I just think the booklet should contain more information than it does. I paid for this package Euros 99,99 in Berlin.",1215993600,2,240,4.4772727272727275
2697994,5,B000KWZ7VU,"This is, by far, one of the most valued treasures of my CD and DVD library. If I were stranded on the cliche deserted island and left with my choice of DVD to possess, this would be it hands down. I would also try to cheat my way into bringing the equally exceptional performances of the piano concerti on DVD.

Not only are these performances extraordinarly brilliant, but are accompanied by six masterclasses given by Barenboim in Chicago. These masterclasses are more than beneficial to watch. Even if one is playing one of the other 26 opused sonatas (or something entirely different), these in-depth classes are indispensable.

At the time I'm writing this review, this set is currently 30% off. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of this steal!",1213574400,4,754,4.792307692307692
2697995,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Barenboim's Beethoven is more intelligent and more musical than others. His sense of structure, his touch, his ability to make the piano ""sing"", everything is superb. The masterclasses give us the oportunity to understand the performer's points of view not only on Beethoven but also on music. A TREASURE just like this, in capital letters!!!",1200528000,4,342,5.236363636363636
2697996,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Beethoven was a revolutionary man living in a revolutionary time. He captured his inner voice, demons and all and the spirit of his time, and in doing so, created a body of music the likes of which no one had ever before imagined. A virtuoso at the keyboard, Beethoven used the piano as his personal musical laboratory, and the piano sonata became, more than any other genre of music, a place where he could experiment with harmony and his developing view of music as a self expressive art. Spanning the length of his compositional career, Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas provide a window into his personal musical development, and they show the concept of the piano as an instrument and the piano sonata as a genre undergoing an extraordinary evolution. The sonatas are not simply compositions for the piano, but are about the developing technology of the piano itself, an evolving instrument that Beethoven pushed to its limits and then beyond, ultimately writing music for an idealized piano that didn't come into existence until about 40 years after he died. Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas include some of his most popular works that took him about 30 years to compose gradually transforming a medium that Mozart and Haydn had already turned into a staple of Classical expression to a vehicle for personal expression that takes us to the time of 19th century Romanticism. These works were very much intended for home entertainment, and Beethoven initially continued that tradition by writing a number of works for his students to play. But as he began to be affected by deafness, playing the piano became his only tangible means of, as it were, 'hearing' music.

There's no denying Beethoven's capacity for communing with the soul through his piano. The adventures in form and musical working out of ideas were all part of this need to say things in music that had never been said before. Beethoven was constantly striving for more, particularly in range and dynamic capability. As an example, he composed the ""Hammerklavier"" Sonata about seven years before he had a piano that could cope with its demands of register. He often said, ""The whole tribe of pianoforte manufacturers have been swarming around me in their anxiety to serve me and all for nothing."" Just one more example of the way Beethoven in his sonatas was always ahead of the game.  In this 6 DVD set Daniel Barenboim does an amazing job of playing all of Beethoven's sonatas and what truly baffles and impresses me the most every time I watch this set is that he plays them all by memory. This is a wonderful set and anyone interested in seeing Beethoven's sonatas performed will not be disappointed.  Truly, Beethoven's piano music is his voice, emerging from his mind, through his fingers, to our ears and hearts. And his piano sonatas are, more than any other of his amazing works, his personal testament, expressed in his own voice.",1199664000,4,2901,4.868421052631579
8159331,5,B000KWZ7VU,Recipient of the Gift was very happy with the Music,1424563200,,51,4.2
8159332,5,B000KWZ7VU,"It's a very high quality production with the amazing top pianist Daniel Barenboim, who as usual performances with his profound knowledge on Beethoven's interpretation.

8159333,4,B000KWZ7VU,"I personally believe this series of concert recordings should have been rated a 4.5, but since the rating system only allows 5 choices, I chose a ""4"", which is explained in my closing comments.

I enjoyed watching and listening to these DVDs - a total of 6 separate discs, plus Barenboim's personal written analyses of each of the 32 sonatas.  This is a lot of Beethoven to work one's way through and I took a bit over a week to do it and will likely need to repeat that several times to properly appreciate what this set of amazing DVDs represents.  Overall, the performances are terrific, particularly considering the fact Barenboim appeared to have performed them in a short time frame.  4 of the DVDs contain the actual concerts - 8 separate concerts of 3 to 5 sonatas each before a live audience.  Barenboim's playing was impressive for its somewhat romantic interpretations and technical brilliance, but in some of the more ""bombastic"" pieces, I felt the microphones were not placed as well as they could have been - there were times when the piano sounded like the microphones were a bit too close and large fortissimos came across with too much of a ""crashing"" sound.  I lowered the base output on my system, and it was still a bit of a problem - not enough to take away from the enjoyment of Barenboim's playing, which is borderline amazing, but the ""crashing"" sound did occasionally distract.  The acoustics of the hall were captured quite well with the exception noted above.

The remaining 2 discs are of Barenboim conducting master classes with a 6 notable pianists: Shai Wonser, Alessio Bax, Jonathan Biss, David Kadouch, Saleem Abboud and Lang Lang.  In each case, the individual pianists played portions from 6 sonatas Barenboim performed as part of the 8 concerts, followed by critiques and discussions with the master class ""students"".  I enjoyed hearing how these accomplished pianists approached the pieces they played and how they differed from Barenboim's interpretations.  And it was interesting to witness 6 well-regarded pianists adjusting their approaches to the pieces selected based on Barenboim's recommendations, etc.

I was a music major in college (clarinet, not piano), and had to learn to play piano well enough to work my way through a number of these sonatas in classes where we analyzed these amazing works - actually they were a major part of all music majors' training.  They are monumental, not only for the incredible skill they demand from the pianist, but also because they represent the bench mark of music written for solo piano by one of the greatest musical geniuses in music history - Beethoven's writing for piano changed the way subsequent composers looked at the instrument's range and overall possibilities, if not the way they wrote for any combination of musical instruments.  I couldn't begin to work my way through all 32 sonatas (then or now), and was found myself more than a little dazzled to witness Barenboim perform all 32 sonatas over the course of 8 separate concerts in what appeared in a short period of time completely from memory and with no indication he wasn't completely prepared - plus his playing was routinely brilliant, considering these performances were not something produced in a recording studio.

This set of DVDs a terrific addition to any serious music lover's collection.  The picture and sound quality are both excellent with the sound capturing the apparently wonderful acoustics of the rather intimate hall very well - which could be part of the minor complaint I had about microphone placement; and that small complaint is not going to stop me from enjoying this set of live concert recordings for years to come.  I am delighted to have these wonderful discs as a permanent part of my growing collection of concert DVDs/BlueRays; and I believe this is the only collection available in a video format, which makes it that much more noteworthy.  If it weren't for the occasional ""crashing"" sounds in a few loud passages I believe were likely due to the close placement of the microphones, I would have had no issues with rating this collection with 5 stars.",1393632000,2,4143,4.919655667144907
8159334,5,B000KWZ7VU,"The Beethoven 32 are a cornerstone of the classical piano literature and offer an amazing range of emotional and intellectual challenges to the performer and listener alike. Maestro Barenboim has been performing these pieces since he was 17 and so has been digesting them for over 50 years. Accordingly he is able to approach each single note with comprehensive knowledge of them all and so it seems to me that there is not one nuance in any one movement of any one sonata that has not been thought out from the perspective of all 32 sonatas taken as a whole. This is why I think Maestro B's Beethoven is so great.

These videos are a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to hear great music played by a great musician from the perspective of sitting on the bench beside him. The close ups of his hands and his very individualistic approach to the keyboard are priceless. The sound quality as well as the overall intimacy of the video is first rate.

8159335,5,B000KWZ7VU,A gentleman with a great musical touch. The visuals are steady and give moments of concentration as well as fingering. But mainly the music is good!,1362182400,,148,4.730769230769231
8159336,4,B000KWZ7VU,"Barenboim has never been my favorite pianist. But I've always known the feeling he's brought to music both as a pianist (I like his Chopin Nocturnes) as well as as a conductor (some of the Hindemith he's done is outstanding). A DVD collection of all the Beethoven sonatas by a single artist is vulnerable to all the same complaints as a cycle on CD: odds are you can think of someone you'd rather swap out on a specific sonata.

But right now the pickings are slim, and Barenboim is ""first to market."" That having been said, I can't really complain about the set. It IS, after all, a set. By far and away it has more ups than downs, and its downs aren't that extreme. He plays with a wide range of dynamics, brings the skill, and understands the pieces.

There are complaints in the reviews about the visual choices; I hear them, but I don't think this set is for people yearning to learn all the fingering. You get a fine mix of hand work and facial expressions. You see the technique, and you get plenty of shots of right hands crossing over the left and vice versa.

Yes, people complain about the close ups of beads of sweat, instead of hands. But let's get serious: this is a DVD! It's *supposed* to provide a variety of visual experiences!

My only complaint -- and this is the reason for my only giving it four stars -- is that the master classes are bundled in. Some of us aren't interested in that. And if we were, I would prefer to have them include a coupon to buy them, or some flyer announcing their availability. I don't need to be bundled.",1350259200,,1554,4.348275862068966
8159337,5,B000KWZ7VU,"Watching this set of DVDs and listening to his magnificent performances shows why Barenboim is clearly the pre-eminent performer of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. While many will disagree - after all, there are countless recordings by dozens of performers - what comes through after seeing these recitals is the deep familiarity that Barenboim has with the music. Playing these sonatas for some fifty years, they have become a part of him, and this shows in the way he performs these works with such conviction. (And without scores, which, alas, too many performers depend on.)

This set contains films of a series of eight recitals that Barenboim performed in Berlin in 2005, comprising all 32 of the sonatas. Each recital lasts from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, and contains four sonatas, a mixture of early, middle and late works. The programs themselves work well, but any selection of sonatas played by Barenboim would be fine. The camera work is among the best I've seen for this type of performance; there are enough different camera angles to keep it from being repetitive, and the intensity of watching Barenboim perform is enough to trump the limits of filming. The sound is in PCM stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1; the surround mix is excellent.

Barenboim has already recorded the complete Beethoven sonatas twice: once for EMI when he was in his late twenties, and a second time for DG in the 1980s. One could say that these live recitals are closer to the second recording; slow tempi, much rubato, a great intensity and an often meditative approach to the music. Barenboim shines in the late sonatas, and at the end of the op. 111 sonata (no. 32), his intensity is such that he has to wipe tears from his eyes. But the early Haydnesque/Mozartian sonatas are also wonderful, with a full range of youthful passion.

In addition to the eight recitals, this set contains two DVDs of master classes, where Barenboim shares his knowledge and experience with six young pianists. While much of the discussion is quite technical, even non-musicians will find some of the comments illuminating, providing insights into music in general and these sonatas in particular.

This set is perhaps my best musical purchase in years. I plan to watch these recitals many times, and have gotten many insights into the music - some of the best for piano - simply by watching it performed.",1347062400,,2391,4.838630806845965
8159338,2,B000KWZ7VU,"I have very mixed feelings about this DVD set.  On one hand, the musical content of Beethoven's piano sonatas played by Barenboim is a very wonderful expression of a magnificent set of works for the piano.  However,  the camera work and direction are so bad that I find myself frustrated when I try to watch the DVDs.  My complaints are as follows:

1.  There are more views of Barenboim's face than his fingers.  The director seems to want to make a DVD of the difficulty and struggle of Barenboim playing Beethoven rather than Barenboim playing Beethoven.

2.  When the director shows Barenboim playing the piano, many of the views are either extreme close-ups so we get a detailed view of Barenboim's fifth fingernail, or a bizarre view from below the keyboard with a nice view of Barenboim's wrist.

3.  The director (or editor) seems to have no feel for the music at all.  During the most dramatic and difficult sections of the works, we suddenly cut away to a view from the RIGHT of the piano, where none of the finger work is visible.

This poor film work is very frustrating considering the quality of the performance.  I was especially disappointed since I loved the DVD of Barenboim playing Beethoven's piano concertos, which is a much higher standard of film making.

In summary, parts of these DVDs are wonderful, but overall the direction and editing ruins the overall experience.",1345507200,11,1393,4.7698744769874475
8159339,4,B000KWZ7VU,"Barenboim is not my favorite interpreter of these works -- I prefer Arrau's delicacy -- but these live concerts are a marvel nonetheless. He plays all thirty-two sonatas from memory. Incredible. I only detected a handful of minor flubs.

The video production is very classy, the best I've yet seen for a solo piano concert, with a warm, lush lighting scheme. There are SEVEN cameras surrounding the instrument from every angle. There's even a camera high above and slightly behind Barenboim, looking down with the keyboard stretching from one end of the widescreen image to the other. Splendid! The video switching is conservative and generally very tasteful. I only wish they'd used that spectacular overhead view more, and showed fewer extreme closeups of the artist's face. The poor fellow sweats a lot.

The audio is uncompressed stereo PCM, and of excellent quality. A closely-spaced pair of microphones is visible, suspended in front and above the instrument. The perspective is very close and clear, with little or no audience noise (except for applause between sonatas, of course).

It's hard to imagine this repertory getting a better treatment anytime soon. Too bad this isn't a Blu-ray. Looks great on my HDTV anyway.
