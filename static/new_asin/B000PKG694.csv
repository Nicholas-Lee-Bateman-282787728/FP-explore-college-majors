2825184,4,B000PKG694,"Partition is a beautifully-shot and well-told love story, and this disc features a gorgeous transfer. The commentary (director Vic Sarin and actress Kristin Kreuk) is informative and interesting, and the making of featurette is long. The disc isn't cheap, but it's certainly worth the money; the film sparkles, even on a smaller screen, and the extras are well worth the price.",1187827200,6,377,5.19672131147541
2825185,5,B000PKG694,"Ordinarily, I find historical dramas to be boring, but when I learned in 2006 that this movie was being filmed I contacted Seville studios to find out when it would be released. Unfortunately, this important film was never released in the United States.

It's not often that one can learn about a historical event while enjoying the dramatic reenactment with very high-quality direction, acting, cinematography and music.

During production, the casting director was given a lot of guff for casting Kristin Kreuk as a Pakistani Muslim girl, but I'm here to tell you that she pulled it off and since she is Eurasian, fit into the part perfectly.

Oh, by the way, for those of you who only know her from her character  Lana Lang on Smallville, Kristin is just as beautiful without makeup.

The film is a social commentary on the vagaries of people being judged by their ethnic origin rather than on WHO they are. This still goes on in all the Muslim countries (just look at the modern-day Sunnis/Shi'ites/Kurds in Iraq)

On top of an interesting story well told, there is also excellent cinematography and score that is just icing on the proverbial cake.

Buy this while it's available here on Amazon because the price will likely only go up in time.

2825197,5,B000PKG694,"- recapitulation of the Indian-Pakistani partition period at the micro level.  This is undoubtedly the best film version of this time and place: Attenborough's Gandhi touched on it at the level of high politics, where it was seen as the anti-climax of the Mahatma's career.  In conceptualizing a love story set against the blood hatred of religious war and politics, Vic Sarin shows us the true cost in body and soul of ""simple"" solutions, engineered by comfortable men insulated from the resultant carnage. If only they had to endure for a day the agony they so cavalierly demanded of others. . . .

The best fictional account of this era still belongs to Kushwant Singh's novel, ""Night Train to Pakistan.""  But as no one has attempted to film it, Sarin's creation will remain the definitive reckoning of this event for the general public.  One should also take time to watch the DVD extra sequence on the film's creation, to appreciate the depth and passion of Sarin's vision.",1448755200,,978,4.832335329341317

2825205,4,B000PKG694,"As ties between India and the U.S. grow, Americans need to know more about India, the worlds largest democracy.  In recent decades, movies from India have reached new levels of sophistication in camera work, color, visual impact, plots that explore social issues, and character development.  For foreign audiences, the new films have more appeal than the old Bollywood films that mostly featured romance, song, and dance.  Partition is an excellent film to enlarge an Americans understanding of India.

This portrayal of the tragic side of Indias independence begins before World War II, when India was still part of the British empire.  The tensions of the plot begin to unfold when three men  one British, two Sikh  are deployed with their regiment to fight the Japanese in Burma.  The bulk of the movie takes place in 1947 and the years afterward, when millions of Muslims fled India for the new state of Pakistan, and millions of Sikhs and Hindus moved to India.

The visual richness of Indian and Pakistani villages and cities draw the viewer, and theres a satisfying mix of dramatic themes  love, family ties, communal tensions, violence, tragedy, separation and loss.  Yes, the film introduces India and an important chapter in its history.  But it entertains too.

2825224,5,B000PKG694,"`Partition' is a film easily missed.  A small budget Canadian production devoid of big names, `Partition` tells a tale of divided love set against the partition of the British Raj into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.  With its talented and fetching leads and inspired direction, `Partition' makes for an engrossing and moving film.

Sikh soldier, Gian (Jimi Mistry) returns from fighting the Japanese disorientated and traumatized.  He makes his way back to his home village and attempts to put the killing behind him.  When a band of Muslim refugees is attacked outside his village, he shelters a young girl from the mayhem and murder.

Gian`s `rescue' is soon discovered by his fellow villagers who demand her immediate expulsion.  In one of the film`s dramatic highlights, Gian bravely faces off the mob.  Thus saved, the Muslim girl, Naseem (Kristin Kreuk) helps Gian with the upkeep of his home and eventually ventures out into the village.  `Let them see their enemy,"" she states.

Gradually, Gian and Naseem share more than household chores and an intimacy develops that is wonderfully shaped through Vic Sarin`s understated direction.

`Partition`s' defining moment comes when Gian and Naseem, now happily married with a son, receive word that Naseem`s mother and two brothers survived the massacre and are living in Pakistan.  Naseem must make a difficult choice:  stay with Gian and son in India or visit her family with the risk she might never return to India.  Kristen Kreuk plays the scene perfectly with a complex mix of joy, sorrow, and trepidation.

Naseem chooses to visit and thus makes a fateful decision for Gian and their son.  When Naseem is held captive by her brothers, Gian embarks on a fateful pilgrimage to save his love.

While Naseem and Gian`s dilemma of family versus each other is hardly original, their story and its tragic conclusion remains powerful nevertheless.  This is in part due to the film`s impeccable pace and direction that captivate while never allowing dj vu to rear its ugly head.

Furthermore, the story`s success is assisted most importantly with the two charismatic leads. Jimi Mistry gives Sikh Gian a silent, commanding, and very handsome presence.  Kreuk`s attractive and radiant Naseem makes for a perfect partner for Gian.  Moreover, Mistry`s Gian is struggling to accept his violent past.  With a Gandhi-like hunger for inner peace and external righteousness, Gian finds both in the innocence of Naseem.  `Naseem saved me,' he tells her family when they refuse to let her return.

Finally, `Partition`s` cinematography is simply stunning.  With scenes shot both in Canada and India (where an actual village was constructed for the film), the film captures the color and radiance of India perfectly.  Along with a sumptuous score, the luscious camera work helps you focus on Gian and Naseem`s troubled yet transcendent love.

Is `Partition' an Indian Romeo & Juliet?  Yes and no.  Instead of Montagues and Capulets you have Sikhs and Muslims trying to keep love from uniting their children.  Yet, something about Gian and Naseem`s love, while timeless and universal, felt virgin and untried as well.  If you are hungering for an under-the-radar love story, long on beauty and tragedy, then choose `Partition.'  You won`t be disappointed.",1317427200,,3295,5.146892655367232

2825227,3,B000PKG694,"The 1947 division of Greater India into India and Pakistan was a social disaster, and my favorite book on this topic is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-at-Midnight/dp/8125931643/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom at Midnight</a>.  At least a million people perished and millions became homeless.  It was a singular event, with many, many unique tales of woe.  This film, Partition, is one of these tales, albeit fictional.

A Sikh man (Gian, played by Jimi Mistry), lives in a village in the Punjab subject to communal violence.  Villagers face slaughter by the Muslims in Pakistan, but they participate in a vicious payback. Gian finds a young Muslim woman (Naseem, played by Kristin Kreuk) who escapes the destruction of her caravan.  Although stigmatized by rescuing a Muslim, his village finally accepts her, and Gian and Naseem fall in love.  But the past is never far behind, and zealots work to rip them apart.

The cinematography for this film is beautiful, and the acting of Mistry and Kreuk amazing.  However, the story is weak on so many levels.  Everyone speaks English.  The villages and roads are never congested.  Everything seems clean and orderly.  This is 1947 India?  The characterization of Gian as a battle-hardened soldier who has difficulty protecting his family seems out of place.  How did Naseem's family (sans father) survive the massacre?  Finally, I'm no expert on Islamic law, but doesn't a husband's word and commands trump a brothers?

I wish the storyline was better.",1289088000,,1551,5.504237288135593

Its worth picking up a used copy just to savor the rural/farms scenery. This movie could be much more involving if it was in Urdu/Hindi regional language than entirely English. The kind of people depicted did not use to speak English in day to day life and this makes the film feel artificial. Secondly, if you are interested in the subject, Silent Waters depict the same with much more authenticity and the way a strong message is subtly delivered.",1243382400,2,595,4.730769230769231
2825230,5,B000PKG694,"The Partition is a beautiful love story.  It is set in 1947 when Pakistan and India are split into seperate states.

After some years pass she finds out her family is alive and visits them in Pakistan.  They hold her prisoner and will not let her return to Gian and her son.  Gian risks everything, converting into a Muslim, to save Naseem.  Her family will not release her to him and she has to escape.  As Gian and his son are about to board the train Naseem shows up and for a moment they are reunited.  Naseem's brother and Gian fight and Gian is accidently knocked off a bridge in front of a train.  The Partition is a tremendously moving and awe inspiring story of love that sees no boundries!!!!!",1218326400,,900,4.335329341317365
2825231,4,B000PKG694,"Partition refers to the British empire's partitioning of India into India and Pakistan [and subsequently the forming of the nation of Bangladesh, out of part of Pakistan]. It has been the subject of numerous books and movies, and is truly a tragic period in history.

The movie here centers around Gian [Jimi Mistry], a Sikh who served in WWII, and who is haunted by memories of his friend Walter, who was a war casualty. Gian returns to India to find a nation torn apart by hostilities between Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, and teetering on civil war [which eventually led to partition]. He returns to his little village in Punjab where his old battle comrade, Avtar [Irfan Khan, who played the role of the father in Namesake] leads a group of Sikh villagers to massacre Muslims on their way to migrating to Pakistan. Avtar justifies it as part of the 'war effort', but Gian wants no part in it.

Things get more complicated when a Muslim girl, Naseem [played by Kristin Kreuk] escapes the massacre and is eventually found and sheltered by Gian, earning him the ire of the villagers. Gian and Naseem predictably end up being romantically entangled, but things are not all rosy for the pair. The rest of the story deals with the aftermath of Gian and Naseem's relationship amidst the turmoil of Partition.

Though a lot of the plot seems a bit contrived and predictable, the main actors, esp Mistry's Gian and Kreuk's Naseem, do a credible job of fleshing out the characters. I was initially perturbed by the choice of Kreuk as a Muslim-Pakistani woman, but she pulls it off with aplomb, in fact is quite credible in her portrayal! She conveys scenes of raw emotion with great skill, as does Mistry.

There are good supporting roles, esp the role of Avtar and also Neve Campbell as Margaret, a British citizen who aids Gian and Naseem.

The movie is beautifully shot - the cinematography is breathtaking, esp of the Indian countryside, the period feel of the movie is well-portrayed by the sets, and the score is beguiling.

Partition reminds me of a Hindi movie, Gadar, starring Sunny Deol as a Sikh who rescues a Muslim woman, played by Amisha Patel. The two movies have interesting parallels, but Partition benefits non-Hindi speaking audiences in that it is shot primarily in English, with a few smatterings of local dialect.

On the whole, Partition is a well-made movie on a controversial and painful subject and though it is primarily a romance, the conflicts aroused by Partition are well-conveyed. Highly recommended!",1210896000,12,2524,4.842227378190255
2825232,4,B000PKG694,"The '07 film `Partition' is a bittersweet romance set against the backdrop of the bloody civil war in India during the `40's. The violence between Muslim, Sikh and Hindi finally necessitated the partition of '47 creating the Muslim nation of Pakistan. The starcrossed lovers are Jimi Mistry in the role of the disillusioned Gian and Kristen Kreuk as Naseem, a young Muslim girl Gian saves from death. As one might expect the two eventually fall in love, but can will they be accepted by a population consumed with hatred and distrust?

`Partition' is a very good but not great film about a time and a place Americans know little about. Here and there it reminds me of two of my favorite Hindi films; Pinjar (which also deals with the partition and marriage outside your faith) and Lagaan. This one is certainly not of the caliber of these two but on the positive side you don't have to read subtitles.

My Rating: Jimi Mistry delivers a strong performance as always and Kristen Kreuk shows she's more than just a pretty face. We worth a watch or two for the history lesson if nothing else: -4 Stars-.",1207872000,14,1100,4.635897435897436

The lead female character played by Kristin Kreuk is so lovely and gentle. Jimi Mistry is convincing in many scenes. I saw and felt the pain in his face in many scenes.

This is the right time to show this movie. Just like in the film, today people are killing one another in the name of religions. They don't tolerate one another. This picture shows that only love, tolerance and kindness can eliminate hatred and bring peace to us.

2825235,5,B000PKG694,"This DVD was just a charm from beginning to end in a lot ways and I'm not just referring to the actual movie but the whole package.

This DVD started on a good note from the get go when I was able to take the security tape off with ease, which seems to never happen with any other DVDs I purchase!

Usually I end up ruining the box one way or another and having glue from the tape still remind on the borders of the plastic of the DVD, making the DVD all sticky and one big mess! So I'm super glad it didn't happen this time around.

On to the actual box, I was really pleased with the graphics on the front and back covers. It didn't look cheap and actually looked better than some other DVD box graphics that I own from big budget Hollywood films.

Also all over the box the Warner Bros. appeared it was everywhere even on the DVD wrapping! Which makes me question, if Warner Bros. took part in releasing the DVD, why not the film in theaters? Hmmm...

Now as for the face of the DVD, I wasn't feeling it. Maybe it was meant to look the way that it did but it just didn't go with the good quality of the outside box. The DVD face was this bright orange and the image itself seemed really washed out, to the point you could barely read the words on it. But in reality it's something that really didn't irritate me too much since it's what's on that DVD that counts!

The DVD interface is really simple, but nicely done and the music which is from the soundtrack as the back drop music really adds a calmness to the interface.

Sometimes some interfaces have so much going on and you have to wait through different intros every time you switch through the different options of the DVD that after the first few times it becomes an annoyance.

The options you have on this DVD are as followed-- Play Movie, Set up, Special Features and Select Scene. The ones I listed below have other sub features to them:

Set up:

You can dub the movie into French and change the audio for the English version of the movie...not sure as to what you can change it to, but there's no options to put English or French subtitles.

Special Features:

Includes:

Commentary with director Vic Sarin and Actress Kristin Kreuk - Vic and Kristin spend most of the commentary talking about all the work that it took to make the movie as well as explained a lot of the meaning behind a lot of the scenes between all the characters, Kristin of course did all the talking for the Naseem scenes. It was really enjoyable and it was my favorite feature of the DVD.

Trailer - Same as the one you've seen on the official Partition movie site in English, there's also one dubbed in French.

Making of - Same as the one that aired on Movie Details, it's a good 48 minutes worth of the making of Partition, if you haven't seen it already you'll enjoy it even more!

The Movie:

As for the movie itself, I really enjoyed it, the story was very touching, and I learned a part of history I knew very little about. Visually the movie was insanely gorgeous and the message of the over-all movie is something I wish more people followed!

Over-all

My only real complainant of the DVD is the fact there was NO SUBTITLES! How they overlooked that feature is beyond me, but they did!

Besides that I have no other real complainants to throw at the DVD, it was really worth it!",1190160000,2,3421,4.281055900621118

8192293,5,B000PKG694,"Excellent movie. Kristin did a wonderful job from beginning to end even though she is not Indian. You really got to see Naseem evolve through the movie as her relationship with Gian grew. I thought this movie was really well done. The story line was careful not to choose a side between religions. Instead you really got a taste for the anger and fear from each group. The actors were amazing, the photography was excellent and the story is told well.",1517529600,,451,4.580246913580247
