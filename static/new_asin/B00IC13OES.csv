On the other hand, the film is quite slow with not much plot. The filmmakers probably did a nice job making the movie they wanted to, but I was bored for half of it.",1500940800,,353,4.042857142857143
8640799,2,B00IC13OES,"Don't get me wrong. I love Amazon streaming video. I use to have Netflix but as you all know after you have watched a lot of movies it becomes very hard to find a good movie. The same applies to Amazon, but here they get new movies a lot faster that Netflix. So I am like everyone else, I find a movie in Amazon that looks good, read the reviews, go to IMBD or Rotten Tomatoes and further read and then make my decision. Sometimes I watch one that everyone thinks is bad just to see what all the negative reviews about. So you can't trust anyone's reviews it seems. First, everyone has different tastes. Second everyone has an agenda. I love horror and thrillers.
You must go into the search for a good horror movie with one thought to bank on : out of 100 horror movies made , only 5 are going to be good, so be prepared to lower your standards and enjoy some ** star movies, albeit hard to watch, most have 10-15 minutes of good viewing LOL. But what a joy when you find one that you like but didn't know about. It's really about the hunt, I suppose, but not everybody likes to have Lucy pull the football away just when Charlie Brown is approaching for the kick.
 And so I rented this film, just to see something different. I get the premise. This movie is pretty bad. The message is important.
 And so many children, boys and girls are subject to torture and abuse, and then become the abusers. There is such desperation in the real world, but sadly the well intentioned director could not convey it in the story. You won't even remember watching this. But do your thing, rent what you want . And by the way - I am like you - when I see all of the award , official nomination stuff surrounded by the palms, or whatever they are, oh yes, I say Wow ! Look at all the awards -",1407715200,6,1777,4.177842565597667
8640800,1,B00IC13OES,"Plodding, precious, tedious and ultimately unbearable, despite gratuitous nudity and what seemed like an intriguing concept.  You'll never want to hear another cello again.",1405468800,5,172,6.166666666666667
8640801,1,B00IC13OES,"I guess that I'm the only one who didn't see the point of this movie. I tried, I really tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't. The only thing that I would give it is that the acting of the main character was believable.",1404691200,,219,3.888888888888889
8640802,5,B00IC13OES,"Hauntingly beautiful, nightmarishly perfect. You ever go into one of those movies that linger on your mind and seem to cause many mixed emotions within you? Have you seen a movie that builds on the likeness of reality as if the camera doesn't exist and the story doesn't exist because it feels so real, so hauntingly real.

A Measure of the Sin is a surreal, brutal and stunning piece of film. Directed flawless. I can not say enough on how this film comes together in a clarity of emotions and action that becomes a whole part of the person watching. The photography and filming was extraordinarily vivid, vibrant, dark and touching. This movie knows what it wanted to do and it owned and created a piece of cinema that becomes a real inner part of the soul.

8640803,5,B00IC13OES,"I caught this at the AZ Underground Film Festival in 2013 and have been eagerly waiting another opportunity to see it since then. It is haunting. Beautiful. Poetic. Artfully crafted. Original. Courageous. Unlike anything else I've seen. It's a psychological, emotionally captivating yet subtle kind of horror - you won't scream and spill your popcorn, but you will find this story working its way around in your head for weeks, months, maybe years after. It's compelling and it lingers, thoughtfully, well after the credits have rolled.

I'm not going to recap the story because I can't adequately do that - it's complex, and the way the spell is woven is as essential to the experience as the story itself - so if I even listed the key plot lines that would reduce a tapestry to a spool of thread.

Find a way to see it. At a festival or other big screen if you're lucky, or on DVD, which will still be a treat. You won't regret it, and you won't forget it, either.",1398556800,2,966,4.545977011494253
8640804,5,B00IC13OES,"Very cool movie, saw it at a film festival last year... what can I say, its a bit a of a head trip, a journey inside this girl's mind, she sees evil bears and its shot beautifully.  I think on film.  I'd call it art/horror which is cool, cuz it makes you think at the same time it scares you.  I can't say I've seen anything like this before, hopefully I will again.",1395100800,4,366,3.9863013698630136
