2663104,5,B000IS5J64,I recently purchased this DVD and I love this workout! It is so much fun and you will definitely work up a sweat. I recommend this product.,1324425600,,139,4.185185185185185
2663105,5,B000IS5J64,"Got this tape after doing the Turbo Jam workout. This workout video really works you.  I have been doing Pilates so was already familiar with some of the exercises but I still was sore the next day after doing AB JAM.  I must say that between the two videos, doing both at least 6 days a week I have been able to get into a pair of jeans that I could not zipper and button only a few weeks ago.",1312329600,4,394,3.9125
2663106,5,B000IS5J64,"Love, love, love this ab routine! I have some major back problems and was told I need to stengthen my core muscles. But, laying on the floor doing ab exercises killed my back. But, this DVDs first 10 minutes is done on your feet. So, it worked great for me. After a month of doing only the first 10 minutes of the DVD I was able to do the 10 minutes of floor exercises. Can't say enough good things about this DVD. I feel the burn the next day no matter how many times I've done it. And, it's short enough I can fit it into my schedule every day! You gotta try it!",1302134400,5,564,3.956140350877193
2663107,5,B000IS5J64,Great 10 min. workout.  Feels the burn every time.  Great for people who don't have a whole lot of time!,1252713600,2,104,4.15
2663108,3,B000IS5J64,"Overall, I think this is a pretty good ab video.  The only thing I would have liked to be added is more lower ab exercises.  After three kids I need extra help in this area and like most videos it just doesn't terget that area enough for me.  I was hoping this one would.  I LOVE the Turbo Sculpt video, but that one doesn't focus on the lower abs enough either.  If you're looking for overall strengthening of the abs then try it.  Watch your lower back so that you don't strain it.",1251158400,3,483,4.139784946236559
2663109,5,B000IS5J64,"I love Chalene! Her Ab Jam uses your abs in an unique way. It isn't just standard crunches. I thought my abs were pretty strong, but there are some exercises on the tape I still can't finish all the way through. I was pretty sore for a couple of days after using this routine for the first time. I was sore in places my other ab routines don't hit. I would recommend this to anyone.",1213056000,6,382,4.1066666666666665

8147310,5,B000IS5J64,This is one of the best workouts I've ever done. It really works the problem areas. I love it. Thanks Chalene.,1470009600,,110,4.285714285714286
8147311,1,B000IS5J64,Doesn't say this is a VHS tape not a DVD,1461024000,,40,3.1
8147312,5,B000IS5J64,"I LOVE this ab workout. It starts with a standing ab routine which will really get you warmed up. During the standing part you can work your legs a little, too. The second part is a floor routine which can be intense! I like the way she suggests modifying and ways to make the moves easier or harder. Her upbeat, encouraging attitude makes it fun. I have three kids (including a set of twins) and with the help of this video I feel comfortable wearing a two-piece bathing suit in public again!",1453507200,,493,4.369565217391305

8147315,4,B000IS5J64,"When I was first starting out with kickboxing, I enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbo-Jam-Cardio-Party/dp/B000LBZISM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbo Jam Cardio Party</a>, but as I became more experienced, I moved on to other things.  However, I recently had the opportunity to re-acquire a used copy of the Turbo Jam set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beachbody-Turbo-Jam-5-Workouts-Dvd/dp/B00H13JKWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beachbody Turbo Jam (5 Workouts Dvd)</a>) and decided to go for it.  I was particularly curious about AB JAM, as I've been focusing more on my core lately in preparation for an upcoming vacation (and I've also been using another Beachbody set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hip-Hop-Abs-Level-2/dp/B00GW5RTU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hip Hop Abs Level 2</a>).

Although the DVD case says that Ab Jam is 40 minutes, this is the running time with extras (Jam'd, Meet the Cast); the actual workout time is approximately 18 minutes.  As is typical in her Turbo Jam workouts, instructor Chalene Johnson leads a large class, including modifiers Mindy and Anna-Rita.  The first half of the routine is performed standing.  Johnson starts with a pelvic tilt, adding in a side crunch.  She continues to weave in classic Turbo Jam moves such as wheel, performing the moves slowly and with an emphasis on the core.  Other exercises in the standing portion include a punch with hip lift, shake and shed, and side leg kick.

At approximately the 9-minute mark, the workout moves to the floor.  Here Johnson mainly performs crunch-type moves, but often with a bit of a kickboxing twist.  She starts with a simple pelvic tilt, adding a crunch, and then moves into a double leg stretch.  Next is a side dip with reach, another crunch, and a brief stretch.  This is followed by a partial roll-up with a knee lift, a side crunch, a cross-punch-crunch, a side-to-side crunch, a crunch with alternating legs, and finally, seated knee drops.  A very brief (30 seconds) stretch concludes the workout.

I do like this workout, but at the same time, I was a bit disappointed as well.  When I do Hip Hop Abs, I get a great cardio workout AND I can really feel it in my abs.  Not only is AB JAM less cardio intensive than the other Turbo Jam workouts (despite wearing my 1# weighted gloves), but also I didn't even feel it in my core as much as I had hoped.  The shorter length of this routine makes it a decent add-on workout, but my final rating is 3 1/2 stars.",1406937600,,2603,5.513853904282116
8147316,5,B000IS5J64,"I cant believe I have owned this video for 2 years and never did the workout! it is an amazing and effective workout. I tried the insanity check hoping for a more intense workout with sets that focused on the core. The insanity check was just that but way way too intense for my age (49). Insanity has the high jumps that land into a squat then into a push-up and a frog jump. eeek! way too much for me but great for a younger group. turbo jam fat blaster offers an equally high intensity heart racing workout that is also fun. charlene is motivating, funny and very interactive. not a boring moment. she also stresses that turbo jam is a secret weapon for people who need to burn a lot of calories fast like when getting ready for a wedding. I love it! I can see myself doing this 5 days a week.",1372809600,,796,4.175324675324675
8147317,2,B000IS5J64,Watch out.  This DVD is not the same as the original with Special Feature which includes Tony Horton's ab workout.  That was the only reason I paid $52 for this dvd and it does not include it.,1329523200,,192,4.162162162162162
8147318,5,B000IS5J64,I like the standing abs portion.  There aren't many ab workouts that have quality standing abs.  The second seated portion is good as well.,1327708800,,139,4.75
