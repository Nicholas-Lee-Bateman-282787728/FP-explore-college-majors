8748943,5,B01AYYY520,"I loved this show as an 80s child and even had some of the dolls. This DVD set was released only in Germany, but while the menu screen is in German, as long as you have a region-free DVD player (which are quite inexpensive) you can set the audio track to its original English.

This cartoon is about Lady Lovelylocks, a young noblewoman with magical hair that allows her to protect her kingdom. The villain of the series if Duchess Ravenwaves, who is jealous of Lady and constantly schemes to steal a lock of her hair so she can possess its magic. Each girl has a host of sidekicks, but the best are Shining Glory, Lady's court wizard, and Prince Strongheart. Shining Glory and Strongheart are cursed; Shining Glory has been blinded, and Strongheart - Lady's love interest - has been turned into a dog. Prince Strongheart can only take his true human form during a full moon, but Lady can never see his true form unless it's his reflection. They pine for each other throughout the series, but she doesn't know the castle dog is actually her love, and he is left to agonize knowing the best he can hope for is for her to catch his reflection in the lake.

The series is very sweet, entertaining, romantic, and funny. I would recommend it to anyone; I watched and enjoyed it when I was five, but at thirty-five I find it just as adorable.",1494806400,,1336,4.448979591836735
