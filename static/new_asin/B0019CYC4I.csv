8273442,1,B0019CYC4I,It is unbelievable that this DVD wasn't advertise as an amateur DVD as ebay does where the Buyer can consider that. And I regret being excited by the title and not having read the customer reviews. Extremely poor almost unviewable quality with nothing of interest. Buyers should beware and invest their money in professional DVDs or make your own which are sure to be better and more interesting.,1230422400,3,396,4.838235294117647
8273443,1,B0019CYC4I,"I did not purchase this item, but once I saw Rev. Wright prominently featured on the cover, I was suspect.  I am sorry others are not as cynical as I am and wasted their money.",1227312000,,176,4.0285714285714285
8273444,1,B0019CYC4I,This video is disgusting and criminal.  Poor quality - had absolutely nothing to do with Sen. Obama and was free links from Rev. Wrights church.  This is a laughable DVD not worthy of a star rating.  Negative 10!,1224979200,3,212,4.526315789473684
8273445,1,B0019CYC4I,"This DVD advertises ""The best speeches of Barack Obama.""  In fact, it's two speeches recorded with a cheap video camera off the web.  The quality is bad, both audio and visual.  And the portions of Rev Jeremiah Wright were digitized, and not watchable.  The Obama campaign should put a court order against selling this DVD!",1214956800,6,323,4.818181818181818
