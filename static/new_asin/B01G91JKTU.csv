8762565,5,B01G91JKTU,"The perfect companion to Al Froms amazing 2013 book! The film traces the history and development of the DLC and the amazing people who brought it to life. Many of the themes are truly timeless and as relevant today as they were when then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992. A fitting tribute to Al From, the man who saved the Democrat party from political oblivion.",1469836800,,391,4.764705882352941
