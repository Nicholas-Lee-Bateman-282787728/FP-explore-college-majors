I'd recommend watching the DVD once before trying the exercises so you know what's coming.  It does move fast -- but I love that!  Other DVDs go so slow that I get bored, this one's perfect.  I particularly like the flexibility portion of the program, although the strength part is definitely what made the most difference in my body right away, probably because I hardly ever do strength training.  Overall I'd recommend this DVD to my friends.  I take it with me when I'm traveling, play it on my computer, get a little cardio in on the road.",1227744000,8,710,4.449612403100775

Desi uses fun, dance-like combinations to get your heart pumping and the pounds vanishing. She adds weights in a safe and controlled way that increases the challenge and builds muscle faster than aerobics alone can. Flexibility is increased with Desi's unique, yoga type stretches combined with tips on how to breath correctly to get the most out of each section of her video. I can do one, two or three parts depending on how I feel or how much time I have on any given day. It's the best! Desi's healthy, warm spirit is contagious!

The cardio section here is boring, and the voiceover is just horrible! The instructor  seems fake and is just really annoying.

3061434,3,B00116RCVW,"I borrowed this dvd from the library as I often do before purchasing.  I would say that this dvd is more of a beginner/intermediate workout and I felt as a daily exerciser that it was not as challenging as I would have liked, so for me I have decided not to purchase it.  Here is a breakdown of the likes/dislikes:

The dvd has three segments, cardio, flexibility & strength.  Each segment is approx. 20 minutes long.  The cardio segment is simple steps that keep you moving for the entire segment.  The moves are not anything tricky or with any difficult choreography involved.  I felt a more challenging segment would have been nice for a more experienced exerciser, but for a beginner to cardio this would be just about the right intensity as well as a good length of time if you are just starting out.  If you have been exercising awhile, you may find like me that the segment was a bit too boring.  Flexibility is a nice stretch for your muscles and I enjoyed this segment, no gripes here, good stretching and that is good for beginners to advanced.  Strength is with hand-weights and the moves are simple to follow and you can amp it up or down with lighter or heavier weights. I would caution she does do lunges, so if your knees are an issue you may not feel like this dvd may be right for you.

The dvd is filmed on a beach, and the exercisers are working out on colored blocks.  There are some odd potted plants on the beach-kind of weird, but just an observation.  Cuing was good and the form was good on all three exercisers.

Though I will not be purchasing this for myself I feel it would be a very good dvd to a new exerciser.  You could start with one segment or build up to two or three for a longer workout.",1302134400,,1725,4.313664596273292

Second, for the first two workouts on the program which are cardio and strength respectively, I am surprised and disappointed at the intense speed with which Desi starts the exercises.  What she calls a warm-up is just awful - it's really a high speed workout, and that's not the way to begin exercising.  I think it's necessary to do your own warm-up before hand.

8240785,2,B00116RCVW,"I'm a high beginner/low intermediate vidiot who was (like many others) drawn to the idea of utilizing all three required fitness practices into one DVD.  Unfortunately I felt as though I wasted my money.

The entire workout is done via voiceover which doesn't always match the movements on the screen.  The same problem can be said for many other DVDs created by Acacia Fitness such as the ""Dance And Be Fit"" series (particularly the Latin Groove workout led by the exact same instructor).

I have no problems with the instructor, her attire or the sound of her voice that I understand varies with others.  The workouts are a different story.

CARDIO: I liked that she alternated using the left and right lead leg for her combinations.  The cardio moves were also basic low impact movements like step touches, grapevines and mambos infused with basketball shuffles, hopping squats and chasses that I think many people wouldn't have a hard time following.  The cues are lacking due to the voiceover work and I thought that she could've used more actual cardio moves instead of lower body toning that should strictly be in the strength training section. It's not the worst cardio workout I've ever done but not anything new.

TONING: This segment is by far the worst for me.  Though I commend her for using compound movements to work more muscles in a shorter amount of time (combining bicep curls and lunges or plies with upright rows), she goes at an abnormally quick pace so you can't use a weight that's heavy enough to provide challenge.  The voiceover is also noticeably inconsistant here and it's easy to get lost.  There's one portion of back rows and tricep kickbacks near the end that are completely off beat.  I was hoping when she was doing the standing abwork (also too quickly paced to correctly concentrate on the abdominal contraction) the workout would be over but she chose to raise the heartrate yet again by TIFTT (taking it from the top).  At that point, I was far too frustrated to continue.

FLEXIBILITY: This is a very basic, slow-moving stretching segment that would be good for athletes who don't like yoga.  As a previous reviewer stated, I've seen better stretching segments in workouts and her voice could be quite distracting for those who are used to a calming atmosphere.  I prefer Desi Bartlett's ""Better Belly Yoga by Prevention"" or ""Yoga For Beginners"" if you want a complete and relaxing stretching routine.

The warmups for the CARDIO and TONING section are almost exactly the same and move extremely quickly whereas the cooldowns mostly consists of slow squats and spinal rolls.  She should've copied a page out of Denise Austin's book and seperated the warmup and cooldown into more thorough chapters.

Overall, I wasn't a fan of this workout and have a feeling that it'll be a new addition in my next yard sale.",1401667200,,2849,4.823045267489712

I consider myself between beginner-intermediate, and though I found the 3 workouts effective, the cuing on the cardio and strength sections were too quick causing me to rewind and start over several times. I also did not like that the workouts are pre-recorded with Desi and two other ladies following along. I prefer to have the instructor looking and talking to me at the same time. Though this won't be a fave dvd, I will workout with it from time to time because the workouts themselves are great!",1378252800,3,566,4.5588235294117645
8240787,3,B00116RCVW,"This DVD has 3 20-minute segments: cardio, strength, and flexibility/stretching.  Each workout can stand alone or be combined with others.  The workouts are short but powerful.  I use it to get more variety in my workouts.  I prefer slightly longer workouts for regular use, but these are great for days when I don't have much time.",1366329600,,332,4.875
