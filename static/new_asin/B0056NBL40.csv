8459781,2,B0056NBL40,"Jesse Torrez (Roger Gutierrez) is a ranchero, son of a ranchero. He has saved up enough money to go to the big city to live. There is meets up with Tommy (Brian Eric Johnson) who has become too involved in the local scene to find his way back home. Jesse tries to help Tommy who appears nonredeemable. Jesse doesn't try to save the world, just his ""Lil' Bit"" (Christina Woods) of it, a young girl with secrets. Danny Trejo makes an appearance at the end of the feature. Oh, Jesse also likes to take black and white realistic somewhat gritty photos.

The film is an indie drama with a faux gritty background. It is a boring look at character and relationships. The theme of the film is that real men work long tiresome jobs and don't become bad guys.
