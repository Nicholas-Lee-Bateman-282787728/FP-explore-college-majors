7980951,5,B00008AOT6,"Being a huge fan of Farewell, My Concubine I was extremely excited when I read the synopsis of this film. However, when comparing it directly to Farewell, My Concubine this film falls short of the brilliance exuded by that film. Though when you compare don't compare it to that film, it was a very brilliant movie on its own. The actors were amazing, the cinematography was excellent, and the romance, though short, was beautiful. I really enjoyed watching this movie and was hoping for a happy ending but the ending wasn't as tragic as the FMC.  I am very surprised that this movie isn't more widely known because it was done beautifully and the time that I spent watching it just flew by.  I would definitely recommend watching this movie and experiencing some good Chinese opera and unrequited romance!!",1374451200,,806,4.7913669064748206
7980952,4,B00008AOT6,"This is another beautiful film of life in a China that is in the process of transforming from a traditional way of life into Communism.  In the midst of this change the Chinese opera continues as it has for decades.  We go backstage and watch the actors prepare for a performance in which even the slightest gesture is dictated by tradition.  All of this is happening as the country moves to Communism.  And then we have the love story between the
the ""star"" and the westernized young man who falls in love with him, trying to form a forbidden relationship. It is so poignant, and you want it to work out for them.  The scene on the Great Wall where the actor sings for his friends will take your breath away. But remember, the course of love never did run true. Don't miss this cultural and human experience.",1366243200,,809,4.4391891891891895
7980953,5,B00008AOT6,I particularly loved the way the story teller took his time to explain how he ended up being lonely and how he wished things were different and not complicated when you have finally found the one that you love and cherish. I would recommend it to anyone that loves films like this,1280016000,,280,4.403846153846154
7980954,4,B00008AOT6,"I got it to continue to hear Chinese. It is good Mandarin, easier to understand than most Chinese films. The period sets and visualization of the characters aging and of the history is excellent. The cinematography is well above average and makes the movie superb technically. this is the feast for the eyes.

The continuity is a bit off. Possibly the underlying opera is so well known that it doesn't need to be but hinted at for Chinese audiences, but for Western viewers the movie comes across a bit disjointed, like every tenth minute is gone or the detective saw a clue but didn't verbalize it for our benefit. I spent the whole movie wondering exactly who was recounting the story, and i still wonder how long they were married. etc.

The reviews online seem to concentrate on the gay aspect of the film. Some use terms like: the director pimps out the star to the local rich playboy, in any case the relationships suffer a bit from lack of coherent or verbal explanation. It was not obvious at first who whipped the opera star, nor was it obvious if the relationship with the black long haired man was consensual or forced. As a result, what was apparently the movie's goal, an examination of love in several conflicting forms, suffers as the viewer tries to fill in the necessary blanks to build the story line in one's mind. But the big point, the suffering, the agony of a forbidden love is portrayed rather well, if a big obscured at times due to lack of information and coherence/completeness.

I like the general retrospective mode(the movie makes it into a power emotional appeal), as i get older i too tend to reminisce and i often wonder what great secrets the older people carry around with them, and unfortunately all too often to their graves. i wonder what i could learn if only i was able to discuss those things with them. Maybe that is the take home message of the movie to me, i really ought to listen carefully to the stories of the old folks, like the one who narrates this movie to us.",1189641600,2,2012,4.537190082644628
7980955,5,B00008AOT6,"This is a mesmorizing, story of a man who returns home to China to marry but is enthralled by the performance of a male opera star; a lyrically told story of two intersecting love triangles. Flawless!",1066089600,8,200,4.583333333333333

[Ye Ben]

(China/Taiwan - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 1.66:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Tianjin, the late 1930's: A young cellist (Huang Lei) returns home from studies abroad and makes preparations to marry his childhood sweetheart (Rene Liu Re-ying), the daughter of a wealthy businessman. But the relationship is soured when Huang meets and falls in love with a male Chinese opera singer (Yin Chao-te) who is being pimped by his mentor to a local gangster (Tai Li-jen). Tragedy ensues.

Several key personnel from CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON were reunited for this Chinese/Taiwanese co-production, including co-director Hsu Li-kong (longtime associate of director Tsai Ming-liang) and co-writer Wang Hui-ling. And while it's a pleasant surprise to find a government-sanctioned Chinese film addressing a number of previously taboo subjects (corruption and hypocrisy in high places, gay romance, etc.), the results are decidedly mixed. Set against the backdrop of sweeping changes which transformed Chinese society during the first half of the 20th century, FLEEING BY NIGHT invites predictable comparisons with Chen Kaige's superior FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, but the resemblance is superficial at best.

Directors Hsu and Yin Chi employ the trappings of traditional Chinese melodrama - villainous gangsters, thwarted love, enduring loyalty, lifelong tragedy, etc. - though the film relies for much of its dramatic impact on a measured accumulation of intimate details, an approach which reaps dividends in the long run, despite the film's unsatisfying narrative structure. Huang's doomed relationship with Liu is allowed to dominate proceedings for a little longer than necessary, and the subsequent romance between Huang and Lin is thwarted at every turn, frustrating audience expectations and leading some critics to question the film's sexual politics. In fact, despite a lush orchestral score by Chris Babida, the movie lacks a formal visual grace, thanks to production design (by Sung Chun) which fails to generate an appropriate period ambience, and non-stylized cinematography by Tsai Cheng-hui (SWEET DEGENERATION, MURMUR OF YOUTH).

More a tragedy than a love story, the narrative builds to a genuinely heartbreaking conclusion: Few will be unmoved by a blunt, devastating sequence at the end of the movie in which Huang and Yin are 'reunited' after many years apart, all the more heartbreaking for the understated manner in which it is staged. Huang (LIFE ON A STRING, THE PHANTOM LOVER) makes an attractive and sympathetic protagonist, while Yin smoulders intensely in a difficult role, and Liu (who made an impressive debut five years earlier in the title role of SIAO YU) is quietly effective as the understanding wallflower laid low by her fiancee's deceit. Equally memorable is Tai, playing the nominal 'villain' as a sympathetic character hidebound by traditions and his place within Chinese society. Ultimately, some viewers will reject the film's deliberate pacing, while others will embrace its quiet dignity and grand romantic heart.",1052956800,11,3075,5.55982905982906
7980957,5,B00008AOT6,"I am not going to rave about the sets, or the acting, or the quality of the production.  They were all very good.
The film is narrated intermittently by the cellist and his fiance, in the form of letters to each other while they are apart at different points in the movie, and I really thought this added to the somber, but also romantic, mood
The background musical scores are beautiful, sometimes touching, often tragic.
This film was absolutely charming, and at the same time, terribly depressing, in a romantic sort of way.  A young male cellist meets a woman whom he is supposed to marry, and shortly after they first meet, they attend a Chinese Opera.  The lead of the opera is a handsome young man who is srictly ""controlled"" by a somewhat older rich man, his lover.  Both the cellist and his fiance fall in love with the Opera star, and eventually, the two younger men briefly touch upon their love for each other.  The fiance discovers this, then the older rich guy does too... and then everyone knows.
From there, it gets more and more depressing.  I won't divulge the details of the second half, but especially depressing is the fate of the ex-opera star as he desperately attempts to reunite with the cellist.  In the end, you are taught a lesson about never missing an opportunity for true love....
Buy this movie, and watch it with a close friend or someone you love.  And then hold him or her tight and never let go.",1050796800,16,1431,4.51937984496124
