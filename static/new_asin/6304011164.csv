7859272,5,6304011164,The quality of the item was great and it came in it's original packaging. It brought back a lot of memories for me. Even though its not the entire television series; it was enough for me to re-live my childhood once again. >_<,1378771200,,226,4.27906976744186
7859273,5,6304011164,"I was so excited to find Mutant league. I used to wake up as a teenager to watch these on tv. THis brought back old memories. Regardless, the vhs's came in perfect condition, both work just fine no problems what so ever. Good trusting shipper I will use them in the future.",1334275200,,273,4.269230769230769
7859274,1,6304011164,"Open Your eyes. It's just of bunch of the first epsoiodes taped together. It's not like a whole new movie with a whole new story. Full House did that many years ago. The C.G.I in this ""Movie"" is horrible and just as bad as the C.G.I from the first spiderman film. Granted it's still gorey as the games but this was a saturday moring kids show and this might scar them for life. Infact some of the images are too scary for some kids. Overall,Never buy it. I give this ""movie"" a 0 out of 10.",1297209600,,489,4.104166666666667
7859275,5,6304011164,"It seems you are all extremely greedy changing around 3 hundred to $99.999.99. That's ridiculous!  I have this movie not from A Library and no stickers on it at all. If I was going to sell it the price would be 20 dollars. The reason this movie is just cut episodes edited into a movie. You people need to face reality, No one has that kind of Money for something foolish as a VHS Tape. I would rather spend my money on a arcade cabinet than a measly Tape that probably has lines in it.",1272585600,,486,4.11578947368421
