8204854,5,7884031299,"The performance here are stellar! However, buyer beware!!! I have bought 2 each 'special edition, blu ray' dvd's and both the sound levels are about 30% of normal dvd's
If you wish to hear this concert one may have to resort to the cd version. As a last resort I purchased another dvd thru ebay.com without the special edition ( this must translate into pulling down one's trousers and bending over ) and the same low sound levels.
I have 4 each 250 watt amplifiers and two 400 watt so I have plenty of power but I really dislike holding my head against the speakers to enjoy the sound.
Warner Brothers you should be ashamed.",1464220800,10,625,4.443478260869565
