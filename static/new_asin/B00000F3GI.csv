1203112,4,B00000F3GI,"Great fast paced action movie with incredible sound. I am not a movie expert, but I don't believe there was, if any, computer genrated images.  This is important because I like somewhat real action (even if the plot is unlikely in the real world).
The characters have a great raport with each other, and there were many laughs in this movie.  I didn't LL Cool J could act!
Don't wait until it comes out on DVD; see this movie today!",1060473600,,432,4.3875
1203113,5,B00000F3GI,"This movie is the bomb. Colin Farrel and Samuel L. Jackson play their characters flawlessly. This could start a rivalry between this and Bad Boys 2. It has plenty of action, suspense and some humor. Awesome, Breathtaking, And Amazing. Just see it before u get left in the dust. :-) Have fun, ya'll.",1060387200,,298,4.6415094339622645
1203114,4,B00000F3GI,"All I remember about the 1970's TV show that serves as the basis of the new film by director Clark Johnson is that it had a REALLY cool theme song, and I used to have a S.W.A.T. costume, complete with rifle and bullet-proof vest, that my Aunt gave me for my seventh birthday. Many a happy afternoon was spent sneaking around my apartment ""Rescuing"" my Mom from imaginary bad guys, humming that cool theme song all the while. So although I have no REAL recollection of the show itself, some primordial instinct made me heed the tug of nostalgia, and it was off to the opening night screening of S.W.A.T. I went. Humming that song the whole way...

 S.W.A.T. opens with a poorly planned bank-heist in the midst of going down the tubes. The bad-guys are about to start shooting the hostages, when Jim Street (Colin Farrel) & Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), two of S.W.A.T.'s finest, arrive to save the day. Unfortunately, a civilian gets hurt, a lawsuit ensues, and Street is transferred, while Gamble walks off the job. Six months later, legendary S.W.A.T. member Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) is given the task of starting up a new team, and Street is recruited, along with your typical action-movie tough-gal Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), street-cop Deke Kay (LL Cool J) and a couple of other nondescript types from Hondo's old team. No sooner is the new team out of the gate than they're called up to pull escort duty for Alex Montel, a French bad-boy on his way to prison who will pay One Hundred Million Dollars (ONE HUNDRAY MEELYEN DOLLAA!) to anyone who can bust him outta S.W.A.T. custody. Let the games begin......

 Director Clark Johnson (Best known as an actor for his role on the late, lamented NBC drama Homicide: Life On The Street) does a nice job in his feature film debut, keeping the pace rolling briskly along, even though the majority of the film's first hour is all set-up. The action kicks in fast and furious after that, though, breathlessly racing along to a mostly satisfying conclusion. The ensemble cast are all given a chance to shine, and although Farrel and Jackson are clearly the stars, LL and Rodriguez get their moments in the sun as well. The only real letdown in the cast is Olivier Martinez as Montel; Although a French villain is VERY topical at the moment, he's given little to do other than set the plot in motion. I would have preferred to see S.W.A.T. be R-rated, as I do like my violence a little more....well, violent. But otherwise S.W.A.T. is sure to hit the bullseye with action fans.",1060387200,2,2546,4.68903803131991

1203220,4,B00000F3GI,"The information contained here is for the new 6disc DVD Complete Series released this past month by Mill Creek Entertainment.

S.W.A.T. premiered 43years ago (whew!) eight months before the debut of Saturday Night Live. This was a time when the popularity of the traditional cop show was winding down, and an everincreasing concern over TV depicted violence was increasing. Todays televised experience & its approach to societal concerns is considerably different from back then. Many younger viewers will find these episodes very dated, and they really are. But I was a teenager then and this Mill Creek offering brought back many memories.

The series S.W.A.T. was a spinoff of the series THE ROOKIES. The pilot episode Killing Ground aired on the night of February 17, 1975 as a twohour episode entitled S.W.A.T. of that third Rookies season. S.W.A.T. produced 37 episodes with season two accounting for twentyfive. Two episodes (Deadly Tide & The Running Man) of this 2nd season played out over two nights so youll only see a total of 35 names listed below. The following information is from the actual DVD insert & discs. Note: This release contains no dreaded flipdiscs.
------------
When People Are In Trouble They Call The Police  When The Police Is In Trouble They Call  S.W.A.T.

Relive the tense showdowns and standoffs as the infamous black van rolls the mean streets of L.A. to deliver justice the hard way. From producer Aaron Spelling (TVs Charlies Angels and Starsky and Hutch) comes one of the toughest, actionpacked crimefighting shows of them all: S.W.A.T.

Fueled by its signature hit theme song, S.W.A.T. chronicled the covert missions of the LAPDs Special Weapons And Tactics unit, an elite five  man group tackling situations too dangerous for even the police to handle. The show introduced a new breed of hard  as  nails cops to audiences; Lt. Dan Hondo Harrelson, (Steve Forest, Spies Like Us), Officer Jim Street (Robert Urich, TVs Vega$, Spencer: Fore Hire), Sgt. David Deacon Kay (Rod Perry), Officer Dominic Luca (Mark Shera, TVs Barnaby Jones), and Officer T.J. McCable (James Coleman).

Enjoy both seasons together for the first time of the acclaimed series that spawned a franchise.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Jackson was superb. While not a deep movie there is plenty of action and the cast worked together extremely well. With early Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez (before F&F), Jeremy Renner, and LL Cool J (before NCIS LA) it is the kind of movie I will kick back and watch once a year or so just to experience the cast and their chemistry AND the action.",1485043200,3,517,4.51063829787234

I liked the addition of a female team member to show that women can be as strong and gritty as men. I didn't like that they cast McCabe as one of the villains (on the TV show he seemed a clean cut guy).

The show opens with a very different team than what gets assembled later in the movie, though the opening sequences set the stage for Hondo Harrelson's return and the formation of his team. I did find that, for me, the bad guy's storyline is one I'd rather skip through until it intersects with the team's.",1471737600,,667,4.336

1203747,4,B00000F3GI,"SWAT is one of those movies that will never get a sequel because it wasn't stellar, but it stands up as a good one-off.

The movie itself is a fairly typical action flick, the plot is fairly linear with a just a couple twists and turns to keep you engaged. The cast, most of them relatively minor names in acting at the time (Jackson and Farrell excluded of course), give a solid performance. Jackson and Farrell have solid on-screen chemistry that provides a lighter sarcastic-comedy element to the action side of things.

It won't go down in cinema history as a classic but if you're looking for something fun to watch on a rainy afternoon, you could definitely do worse.",1431734400,3,673,4.6
1203748,4,B00000F3GI,"I guess one way to look at S.W.A.T. is to compare it with Pride & Glory, which is the first post-rehab movie for Colin Farrell, according to an article featuring an interview of him.  Pride & Glory is so much richer in story, as well as, character dimension.  S.W.A.T. is about good cops essentially and it is predicable that the stars are heroes who doing miraculous feats and don't die at the end of the movie.  I also reviewed Pride & Glory and there is much more that can be said about the movie.  Its best to see it yourself.

The super-hero ending is hokey and it dilutes what is otherwise a decent storyline.  I feel bad for the main actors especially.  The movie should not have included the S.W.A.T. team of four (tired and injured) heading out to another emergency call when their shift ended 12 hours ago.  It would have been three service calls in a row and after the second arduous ordeal its not very realistic.  If a real S.W.A.T. would have responded to that third call, the tone of the closing scene should have been a lot more serious.  The shooting crew went through so much trouble to create a strong opening and went to extremes to make S.W.A.T.  and LAPD appear realistic and the fictional super-hero ending killed it all to a very large extent leaving the impression of  just another cop-bad cop  or cops and robbers movie.

Generally, I like Farrells work after 2006.  I've seen articles quoting him saying something to the effect that his addictions created a remarkable character for him.  Although this is true from his perspective, the type of movies he has done after 2006 have more sole:  less Hollywood; more human elements for people who are not watching movies for the special effects and such.  The good looking dude catches your attention yet he can act.  Probably the reasons he wasn't totally written-off after he burned so many bridges in the industry.  Hope those looks and talent are supported by a great human being.",1430870400,,1957,4.6173913043478265

Some good actors here, but ultimately, the random pacing and poor plot build up just killed it. And for action, these are unforgivable misses. The pacing was slowed down by attempts at character building that had nothing at all to do with the plot, and when the betrayal happened I couldn't help but feel that it came out of nowhere. The escape of the bad guy was too well orchestrated with no basis at all. Where did those resources come from? The people? What brought them together? Money?

1204155,3,B00000F3GI,"SWAT isn't bad it does offer plenty of action and drama. The characters do work well together Jackson does well playing the leader who is tough but human, Colin is good at playing the complex maverick who seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Along with that Colin and Michelle do a good job at showing that their characters appear to be friends who seem to want a little more. The rest of the characters tie in well and assist dynamic of the team.

A summary of the plot is: Jim Street (Colin) is a former SEAL and now working with the LAPD SWAT Team with his partner Gamble (Jeremy). Gamble is a adrenaline addicted officer who constantly disobeyed orders until it lead to his being fired due to disobeying a hold order during a dramatization of the North Hollywood Robbery. Gamble disobeying that order resulted in a civilian injury. Street following his partner ended up in the gun cage. Hondo (Sam) resturns to the LAPD SWAT and is requested to assemble his own team and he chooses his team and from here they must pass the SWAT tests for the captain to approve them. Meanwhile a criminal worth millions, Alex, is arrested for a broken tail light. He makes a 100 million offer to anyone who could free him and from there the team must get him to a prison where he'd be secure. The rest you'll have to find out for yourself.

Now the action scenes are not bad but they are also not the best i have seen. There are not anywhere close to the best i have seen. I would give the action a B rating.

The plot is a little far fetched to say the least, i tend to think the police have the resources to get someone transferred safely even if there is a 100 million bounty. At some point i would think higher law groups would come in and forcibly take control and it would be over. However that wouldn't make much of a movie would it? One of the only other complains i have about the plot is i found myself begging for it to actually get started.

SWAT isn't a great movie but its also not a bad movie. I do like it!

Overall i give SWAT a rating of 3/5 stars it is a good movie for those who like action and don't over think plots. It is also a movie those who aspire to be police officers or SWAT officers would certainly appreciate.",1353283200,,2249,4.233100233100233
1204156,4,B00000F3GI,"For it's genre this is fun well paced film. Story centers on a SWAT cop, Jim Street (Colin Farrell) who has been removed by an unreasonable boss because of a not so good hostage situation. Flash forward six months as SWAT is reorganized by Sergeant ""Hondo""  (Samuel Jackson) and Street is invited to the crew.

The characters are the stronger than the overall story but the story is good enough.

Based on the 1975 TV series of the same name and also starring LL Cool and Michelle Rodriguez.

The budget for this picture was $80M and it made over $207M at the Box Office. Although it did well no blockbuster style sequel was planned thereafter, just a direct to video DVD, ""SWAT: Firefight"" which included a totally new cast.

1204231,3,B00000F3GI,"Loosely based on the controversial mid-70's ABC television series of the same name, the film S.W.A.T. (2003), basically borrows the original characters names, and inserts them into a situation involving a captured criminal's attempts to escape from custody.  Featuring a strong cast, headed by Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, and Jeremy Renner, and with some large scale action pieces, chases, and shootouts, the film was a solid box office winner.

Scant homage is actually paid to the original S.W.A.T. program (1975-76), which was mostly about duty, trust, teamwork, and leadership.  Although this oversight may disappoint dedicated fans of the TV show, most probably regard the S.W.A.T. movie as just another police drama.

LAPD S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons And Tactics) team members Jim Sweet (Farrell) and his partner Brian Gamble (Renner), are involved in a situation where a hostage is injured by one of Gamble's shots.  Gamble and Sweet are reprimanded, and Gamble quits the force after having a fight with his partner.  Sweet is demoted to inventory clerk, where he meets up with Sergeant ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Jackson), who is putting together a new S.W.A.T. team.  Eventually, although Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter) Harrelson's superior officer doesn't approve of some of the members, Hondo completes his team, which consists of Sweet, and officers Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deacon Kaye (LL Cool J), T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles) and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt).

After completing training, the team is assigned to safeguard the transportation of Alexander Montel (Oliver Martinez), an international drug trafficker.  After they prevent Montel from making his escape while being transported, the criminal announces that he will pay a hundred million dollars, to anyone that helps him to escape, which soon makes life very complicated for Hondo and his team.

The movie features a big twist that shatters the unity and integrity which was at the heart of the Steve Forrest led S.W.A.T.  Despite cameos by Forrest, and Rod Perry, besides a few names, a black van, and the theme song from Rhythm Heritage, not much in the movie has anything to do with the original TV series.  Any cache the series had would seem to be minimal, so tying the movie to the series seems like a questionable move, particularly when similar to the film adaptation of Mission Impossible (1996), S.W.A.T. abandons the core values of the source material.

The film is already past the halfway mark before the team even gets their first assignment.  Then once solidified, all that was built up is quickly flushed down the toilet.  While perhaps not the greatest story structure, the film manages to conclude with some nice action scenes centered around a plane landing on a bridge, and chase through the subway, and storm drain systems.  Flashy and PG-13 violent, S.W.A.T. is an entertaining time, though perhaps not a particularly memorable one.  The DVD is loaded with extras, including a couple of commentary tracks, and multiple featurettes including one on weaponry.",1337990400,,3064,5.245901639344262

1204234,5,B00000F3GI,"Directed by Clark Johnson, who has directed some great tv shows, this film is a surprising action masterpiece. Again I feel compelled to add my comments, becuase I don't think any of the 5 star reviews that are on Amazon, reflect all the things that make this movie great.

Firstly, let me say that I have watched this film at the cinema, on tv and then I bought it on dvd. It truly is an exercise in how to make a great police action film. The dialogue is great, the tone is right and the direction is spot on.

On top of the great action set pieces, including the opening and closing scenes,there is awesome acting from Mr Jackson, Mr Renner, LL Cool J and the magnetic and always fascinating, Mr Farrell. If you like this I recommend him highly in ""The Recruit"".

Finally the music, which no-one else has seemed to highlight, is excellent. Most action films are clueless when it comes to the right kind of music to play and when. S.W.A.T. gets it just right, from the re-using of the original theme from the tv show, to the great track on jetplane hostage sequence. Watch it, rent it or buy it... if you want a great combination of plot, direction, pacing, music and action acting, this is one truly overlooked masterpiece!!",1327622400,,1227,4.46875
1204235,3,B00000F3GI,"Every single character, situation, plot twist, and word of dialog in this movie has been seen and heard a hundred times before. See if any of this sounds familiar: A capable but unconventional leader is asked to gather a rebellious group of misfits together and train them to succeed in a dangerous mission where wimpy, traditional men and methods would (naturally) fail. Throw in a tough girl who must prove herself, an antagonistic supervisor who hates the team and does all he can to thwart them, and a villain who makes Hitler look like Dale Carnegie. Does the Dirty Dozen or maybe The Magnificent Seven, just for starters, come to mind? The entire plot of this movie was already trite fifty years ago....and yet, I actually enjoyed watching it.

Why? Well, I liked most of the characters (or should I say, caricatures), hated the villain (an idiotic supervisor....of course), and found the action sequences to be exciting and well done. One nagging issue was (SPOILER ALERT) how Jeremy Renner's character was able to organize an extremely complex escape plan, involving countless cohorts and escape vehicles, two pilots, an airplane, etc. in so short a time....but I can live with this, since nothing else in the movie was realistic either.

If I can recall correctly, the first half of the movie has nothing to do with this.  Disappointed with it since was hoping for more I guess with the movie getting a lot of attention on either Cinemax or HBO where it's played often.  Then the ending I thought was kind of strange as well.  Nonetheless, it could satisfy the average action buff.

1204237,4,B00000F3GI,"S.W.A.T. is a 2003 movie that was upstaged by some megahits released at the same time: now that it is On Demand and on DVD it can be better appreciated for the tight little action film it is.  Though it still plays on the 'good cop/bad cop' concept,  the story and screenplay by Ron Mita,  Jim McClain, David Ayer and David McKenna  based on the television characters designed by Robert Hammer delivers a multilayered look at our police force primarily because it is played out by a strong cast of actors.

As history to the current story is laid out, two Los Angeles S.W.A.T. officers Jim Street (Colin Farrell  and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) had been assigned to stop a violent bank robbery and though they succeeded the unfortunately shot an innocent hostage during the gun fight; Street was suspended and the more violent Gamble was fired. Jump six months later and potential crime situations are so threatening that the veteran SWAT officer Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) is assigned the task of assembling a top flight SWAT team to be trained: Obviously he recruits Street, Gamble as well as McCabe (Josh Charles), Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Deke Kay (LL Cool J).  It is the in and out play of these characters with their boss that adds the expected degree of levity that made the television series so popular. Once training is over the teams assignment is to squelch the prison escape of a French crime boss Alex Montell (Olivier Martinez) and it is this wrench of justice versus payola that divides the SWAT team and results in a chase that is high tension and surprising.

Farrell and Renner are very well cast and are able to explore the permutations of their history versus the decisions that must be made in a situation that holds the possibility of becoming immediately wealthy versus carrying out their commitment to law enforcement with strong credibility. A great movie this is not, but a fine action and psychological thriller it is.  Grady Harp, September 11",1316908800,2,1985,4.797653958944282
1204238,2,B00000F3GI,"From the initial previews, one truly expected an adrenaline rushed film high on the action and low on the brains.  Well, it has very low brains (plot holes corrupt, and lack of logic reaches new heights towards the end) but I was disappointed in the lack of real bravado I saw on the screen.  Sure, there are moments of intensity, but overall the film lacks that special something that makes the heart race (or stop).  With a cast of likable faces (Farrell is such an underrated gem, Rodriguez commands attention, Cool J just oozes `cool' and Jackson knows how to work any tired angle he finds himself facing) it is the lesser knows that take attention away from the stars.  Up and comer Jeremy Renner (well, at the time...for he is now TWO TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE Jeremy Renner) and Larry Poindexter steal all of their scenes with ease.  This summer blockbuster feels cheap and overall just doesn't live up to expectations.  Farrell was on such a role that I wanted this to be up to par for him (his CIA thriller, `The Recruit', which came out the same year, was nearly marvelous).  Instead, `S.W.A.T.' feels like lukewarm leftovers.  It doesn't have any real pizazz and fades quickly from memory.  With all that `charisma' floating around the room you'd think that one of them would make a real impact, but `S.W.A.T.' is a dry offering that is bound to please some but is never going to `impress' anyone.",1311292800,,1409,4.649193548387097

As far as rough and tough police movies go, this one is solid the whole way through, with believable action, all sorts of spectacular gun play, and enough machismo to fill a police station armory.

Old-school sergeant Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) gets a chance to put together an elite S.W.A.T. team, he snatches up the rebellious Street to go along with other police force lepers Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deke Kay (LL Cool J), Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), and TJ McCabe (Josh Charles) hell-bent on proving everyone wrong.  (Absolute great casting for a tough-as-nails cop drama!)

The jist of the action revolves around Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez), a criminal who makes an on-air promise to deliver $100 million dollars to whoever frees him.  Naturally, every delinquent, desperado, and dreamer sees dollar signs, thereby initiating the cat and mouse game between good guys and bad guys.

Samuel L. Jackson is superb as always, dominating every scene in which he stars, and solid performances are turned in by Rodriguez, LL, and Farrell.  The ending sequence is full of intrigue and excitement, with the best (only?) car/plane chase seen in cinema history.  S.W.A.T. delivers what it promises: a hyper, cop tale with plenty of fast-paced action sequences, cool, likable characters, and a pretty exciting ending.",1215388800,,1459,5.122362869198312

I have been waiting and waiting for the second season to come out and I am still waiting but in the meantime these downloads are the next best thing.  I first found out you could watch the second season of SWAT over at AOL video for free and so that is where I was watching them. Then someone asked me about the ones over here at amazon and I was so happy to find them since these episodes are far better than the ones I was watching and they don't have any commericals. I had no problem at all paying 1.99 per episode because the quality of this player is amazing and so easy to use. Over at AOL you never knew if the player was going to work or not and most times it didn't. I have never had any problems with the episodes I have downloaded from amazon.  Like the other reviewer said the main thing is how much space they take up on a hard drive.

One other problem is that some people can't get them to work. After I found out about the episodes being here I told everyone I knew to come get them and only one other person has been able to get them to work for them. I don't know if they don't have new enough systems or what but they certainly have been disappointed.

As I said I have watched the first season over and over and as much as I love the first season I have noticed that the quality of the program really improved in the second season and they branched out more and tried a lot of different things in the second season. It really is a shame that my friends aren't able to watch these episodes and enjoy them as much as I have been.

1204400,2,B00000F3GI,"MT: For a bit of a twist on the usual interview, I've decided to interview SWAT the movie about the movie SWAT.

SWAT: Hi, how are ya?

MT: I'm great.  So let's cut to the chase: SWAT the movie is a remake of the 1970s television show.  The acronym stands for Special Weapons and Tactics, and it glamorizes the police teams that are brought in when military-style tactics are required for an increasingly violent criminal opposition. I love that kind of military drama, and SWAT has a lot of potential.  Bringing the television show into the 21st century seems like a no brainer.  So what does the movie have to offer?

SWAT:  Well we have a returning tough guy, Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), who puts together a team of equally tough dudes and dudettes: Jim Street (Colin Farrell), Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deacon ""Deke"" Kay (LL Cool J), and some other people that aren't as popular.

MT: I know who's in the movie.  What's it about?

SWAT: Oh, right, sorry.  It's about how Jim has a falling out with his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) and that comes back to haunt him.

MT: I just read the IMDB entry and it says the movie is about an imprisoned drug kingpin offering a huge cash reward for anyone who will spring him out of custody.  That sounds cool. So which is it?

SWAT: Oh it's about that too.  That's the second part of the movie. The first part is the SWAT training.

MT: The first PART?

SWAT: C'mon, everybody's gotta be trained, right?

MT: But it takes up the first half of the movie?!

SWAT: Well, sure.  The tension builds as we watch our rookie team gel.  Will Deke run fast enough to catch bad guys?  Will Street reconcile his bad boy reputation with his strait-laced boss? Will Sanchez be tough enough to survive SWAT?

MT: Uh, you mean Michelle Rodriguez, who also played tough-as-nails chicks in Resident Evil and Lost? It's not exactly a surprise that she can keep up, since Sanchez is pretty much like every other character Rodriguez plays in other movies.  Heck, she was even played the same character in Halo 2. While we're on the subject of actors, what's up with Street?  Is he supposed to be American?  He doesn't sound like it.

SWAT: ...well.  See Colin doesn't really do accents.  So, he sort of has this mishmash of tough guy speak and his normal dialect.

MT: Wow. Okay, let's forget the actors for a moment.  The tactics and training that took up the first half of the film seem to go out the window when Gamble has an opportunity to take a hostage but instead uses the woman as an anchor by tying a rope to her and jumping off a bridge.  That doesn't seem very SWAT-ish to me.

SWAT: ... Did I mention the cool theme song to SWAT?  It's really cool. The cast hums it in one scene--*starts humming the song loudly*

MT: Yeah, thanks, SWAT.  To sum up...

SWAT: *stars humming the song even louder*

MT: To sum up, SWAT is a movie conflicted about what it wants to be when it grows up.  It has a lot of attitude but not a lot of meat.  Its central conceit, the idea of a team escorting a bad guy to a destination, is excellent, but not really the kind of thing that you would expect out of SWAT...and it certainly doesn't mimic the training that takes up the first half of the film. All that, and the final fight scene is filmed in near total darkness. Rent the 1970s show if you feel nostalgic.  This movie is just riding on its coattails.",1197763200,,3409,4.414790996784566

Out of the dozen or so Blu-ray movies I've seen so far, this was the least impressive.  I'm avoiding using words like ""disappointing"" because it isn't--the picture quality is amazing.  The lossless audio track, however, left something to be desired.  It just didn't impress the way tracks from movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""The Patriot"" do.

Also--and this could just be old age setting in--but I could swear there's some missing scenes from the theatrical version.  The Bonus Features on this disc are impressively packed, with many deleted scenes and other extras.  I could be wrong, so I won't count against it in the review, but it seems shorter than it should be.

That said, if you are a Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez or Colin Ferrell fan, this is a great flick to own.

Sure it has some nice eye-candy as far as special effects and good looking actors are concerned, BUT, the plot was just a little weak and, as has been said before, uninspired.  The story revolves around Jackson who is hired to put together a new S.W.A.T. team that consists of single mother Michelle and bad-boy Colin who has been penalized for a mistake made in the past and sentenced to work in the guncage.  You see, Colin's former boss (played by Larry Poindexter...who just let me say was my favorite charactor) hates his guts and so is unwilling to have Colin on the team.  But alas, its Jacksons team and so Colin is in.  After training and such the team gets the job of transporting the head of the European crime cartel (Olivier Martinez...is it just me or is this guy the most annoying actor alive...I just hate this guy!) to the pen...the only problem is he's declared on television that he'll give $100 million to anyone who gets him out.  So it only suits that every thug in the area tries to spring him.  The ending has a twist, but it's a twist that you saw coming so it's not that impressive.  Bottom line is, this is not a BAD movie, it's just not a GOOD one either.

1204472,3,B00000F3GI,"Loosely based on the TV series of the same name, ""S.W.A.T."" is an entertaining, if essentially formulaic, police procedural set on the ribboned thoroughfares and sizzling pavements of metropolitan Los Angeles.  Samuel L. Jackson plays an LAPD veteran called back to the force to handpick and train a crack SWAT team made up of promising neophyte recruits.  Colin Farrell, LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez are the actors who make up part of that team.

The creators of ""S.W.A.T."" have done a pretty decent job given the limitations of the genre.  It's true that the plot is standard issue stuff for the most part and the characters have little opportunity to distinguish themselves and develop.  However, the dialogue is frequently crackling and the performers go through the motions with seriousness and conviction.  The action scenes are also well handled, even if they do go a bit overboard from time to time, a problem endemic to virtually all action films these days, not just this one.

1204474,3,B00000F3GI,"When the mean streets of Los Angeles start spiralling out of control the response from City Hall is to start a new crack SWAT team headed by Dan "" Hondo "" Harrelson -played ably by Samuel L Jackson ,despite his being almost visibly on auto-pilot ,so few are thr dramatic demamds of the role .He recruits disgraced former SWAT man Jim Street ( Colin Farrell) and the rest of his team are the politically correct mix of Latino woman ( the always excellent Michelle Rodriguez),black male (L L Cool j ) and another white male officer (Jeremy Renner).This is not merely P.C but an obvious play for the widest possible ethnic appeal to the movie .Indeed ,this is a very calculating and calculated picture -the villain is French ,thus playing to the US dislike of that nation ( a perfectly sensible dislike in my view ;I don't trust them further than i can throw 'em )

The baddie is duly capyured but the fun really starts when he offers $ 100 million to anyone who can bust him out of jail .This is the cue for all hell to break loose -bullets fly ,helicopters explode and cars are driven pell mell on the way to a climax of carnage and blood.

The actors all do well even allowing for the miniscule acting demands made upon them but I suspect the ability to look good in combat gear was the prime requirement for their getting the job .The action scenes are staged well and other than a slight saggging in the mid point of the movie this does at least hold the interest

One for those who like heavy metal on the soundtrack ,lots of loud bangs and fast cutting .Subtle it ain't but its okay mindles popcorn movie making and does pass the time in an adequate manner",1118448000,,1660,4.383116883116883
1204475,2,B00000F3GI,"Ugh! SWAT is a miserable film. I remember when I was a kid and I'd play at Cops and Robbers with other kids. We'd run around with invisible guns indiscriminately shooting at each other. SWAT has that same mentality and is aimed at the same age group. It's not a movie, it's shamefully disguised pro-NRA propaganda. For all the gun glorification and random violence (PG-13 rated violence remember, as they want to expose this drivel to the little kiddies) there is not one subtle moment that tells us guns are dangerous. Here they are just toys and shooting people is just fun.

I shouldn't really complain so hard as for the first whole hour of this film NOTHING happens. It's all devoted to pointless character building which never rises past cliched stereotypes (Michelle Rodriguez expands her range by playing an unhappy, scowling Latino-something she hasn't played before) and is totally ditched with the abrupt, anti-climatic ending.

SWAT promises action and the not-quite high concept plot of a crime-lord offering anyone who can break him out of custody a $100 million reward is never fully realised. We could have had 2 whole hours of excitement but we barely get 45 minutes. It's a slow, boring film with absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. Plus it all seems very 70's. I felt embarressed watching it.

Jackson (the second coolest black man in Hollywood) and Naughty Boy of The Moment, Colin Farrell, this run of the mill police shoot 'em up is average. And by average I mean that when something is supposed to go boom, it does. There's little to no ingenuity, little to no originality, heck, they even brought the catchy S.W.A.T. theme back (updated of course). The good guys are cool, the bad guys are bad, and that's about the size of it. The one thing that really bothered me was seeing the wonderful Michelle Rodriguez co-starring as the stereotypical Tough Latina Girl (tm). After a wonderful screen debut in ""Girlfight"" (go rent it now!), she has yet to star in anything resembling good since then. ""Resident Evil"", ""The Fast and the Furious"", ""Blue Crush"". In every single one, she's Tough Latina Girl, and that's just a shame. It was also a treat to see Jeremy Renner as the S.W.A.T. cop gone bad, as I'd seen him audition and get the role in Bravo TV's ""The IT Factor"" a year earlier. So the bottom line is - if you're looking for a good film, then try elsewhere. If you're looking for something to stare at on your television screen for an hour or two, without any danger of thought or emotion, then S.W.A.T. will do just fine, but if you like your police work with character and emotion, go rent ""Homicide"" directed by David Mamet.",1109203200,13,1447,4.590733590733591

SWAT is VERY FUNNY! There is lots of laughs in this no-brainer action flick. The premise is simple. SWAT members get discharged for messing up an op. SWAT members get back together under the command of L. Jackson. SWAT are assigned to protect and transport a high-profile international criminal to jail..... the catch.... he just offered 100 Million dollars to whoever can bust him out. Que everyone from the Russian mafia to the street gangs trying to take on the SWAT team as they transport the prisoner.

Again SWAT is a no-brainer! The story is total hogwash, but damn if it aint fun! ... and it is. There is lots of SWAT action and comedy along the way. It does take some time to get going but as long as you do not take it too seriously (and the film makers didnt!)... you will be in for some fun.

Prime example is his co-star Samuel Jackson, he takes way too many everage scripts, and while successfully boosts the film, his repertoire cruises downhill. Slug eyebrows needs to learn this, if he's going to be remembered he needs to reject corn on the cob scripts like SWAT.

'Do you feel me' - 'Yeah I feel you' has won the award for most cringingly corny confrontation this year. The film just wanders around until it comes to its anti-climatic insignificant ending where not even the goodys get anything special. I mean what is a Hollywood blockbuster when the heroes don't walk away with a girl, or 1000 billion dollars? While Jackson brings a rather tired performance he's still worth watching, only to take your eyes off those slugs.

Why do Americans think that SWAT are the 'most respected' or generally 'bestest' team in the 'world'?. What about the Ghurkas? The SAS who are far more efficient than SWAT. I think they meant America, not 'world'.

Hopefully slugbrows will stop taking films like this, the same goes for Jackson, but we all know thats never going to happen. The Recruit is his best to this day, ans SWAT his worst.",1102291200,,1314,4.8053097345132745

This film isn't even enough for a plot overview: the only thing to remember about it really is that it was small, annoying, and it stunk.  Although I like good action, there's no action worthy of acclaim here: the action was actually better in the original TV series if you can believe that.  The action was bad not only for the fact that it was rather sterile and bloodless, but it wasn't even imaginative as to the types of tactical situations a SWAT team might encounter. Actually, with the kind of plot they had in this film, it would have been more interesting if it was another Die Hard or Dirty Harry film with a solo cop out on a rampage.

You may like this type of action if you're 14 or younger but this sorry film doesn't do it for me: it's just too shallow, predictable, and completely unengaging. The old TV series are better.",1093392000,8,1072,4.533678756476684
1204525,3,B00000F3GI,"I saw S.W.A.T. in the theater after reading Roger Ebert's 3-star review of the film, and I was expecting to be a lot more intrigued and excited by the film than I actually was. Seeing it again recently more or less confirmed my initial reactions. The first half of this movie is the better half, since the training sequences---particularly the fake-airplane-hostage sequence---are interesting enough. But then Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) blurts out his offer for all lowlifes to try to break him out of handcuffs for a million dollars, and it is then that the movie begins to sink into generic, rather unmemorable action fare. Mr. Ebert said that the action scenes in the second half of S.W.A.T. are ""more or less believable,"" and he has a point (he usually does). On its own terms, the action scenes are reasonably well-directed by Clark Johnson. But you know what? Sheer believability does not necessarily make for exciting action, and though I'll concede that the action is well-done, I never found it terribly interesting or exciting either. The characterizations of the script and the performances by the cast certainly don't help matters. Even Samuel L. Jackson seems to be on autopilot in this movie (which was the biggest disappointment of all, since I usually love watching Jackson perform onscreen), and though the script is partly at fault for the characters' dullness, I wish the actors had been imaginative enough to bring some semblance of a spark to these otherwise generic characters. Instead, the cast merely seems like a group of actors in search of a paycheck. In short, S.W.A.T. is hardly a terrible movie, but for those looking for true action fireworks, look elsewhere (maybe even the old TV show, if this movie really truly makes you curious about it).",1091923200,,1778,4.969798657718121

This is intercut with some convoluted plot about an international drug dealer and his bad guy sentiments.  Also, you get the oh-so-tired captain as bastard plot.  It is trite to say the least.  Then after the druglord is captured you, as the viewer, are expected to believe that an international terrorist can hap hazardly make the proclimation that he will pay someone 100 million dollars to free him from prison and that the majority of Los Angeles will jump on board and do it.  Are you kidding me?  I mean I'm not looking for hyper realism in my action movies, but that is completely absurd.  Then you are expected to believe that these small time thugs could conjure up a death defying search and sieze mission in less than an hour.  It is completely ludicrous.  This movie treats you as nothing more that an empty head.  It gives you nothing to believe in.  There is no redeeming quality to it at all.

1204670,4,B00000F3GI,"S.W.A.T. remains faithful to the TV Series, even with the original music (which has not been updated). Sgt. Dan `Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel Jackson as his usual intense self) runs a nearly roguish group of SWAT members including Jim Street (Colin Farrell as his typical impish self), Michelle Rodriguez (as the `macho' wise-cracking female) and a host of other minor characters. When I say it's faithful to the television series, that's not exactly a positive comment. The action you see in the previews is fairly what you see in this film. Character development takes up most of the first half of the film (and there is not much to develop) and the rest of the action is just not what you would expect from a `blockbuster'. Alex Montel (a nasty Olivier Martinez in a nice role) is the murderous villain who gets caught during a minor traffic violation (What?). As the LAPD discover how big a criminal he is, they transport him to a more secure place as the media is allowed to film him shouting that he'll give one million dollars to anyone who can free him. Thus, every hack criminal in L.A. tries (unsuccessfully, of course) to get him for themselves. Now, if you could free him, what guarantees he is going to pay that million? Never mind - this is just a movie. We are even given a chase scene through the L. A. sewers and subway system (very trite). The action sequences are of TV quality and the only excitement is the finale when a hijacked Lear jet lands on the narrow 6th street bridge in L.A. When a film is made from a television series, usually the ante is upped significantly, but this new version of S.W.A.T. is just rehashed '70's TV screenplay. Only one good guy gets killed and we never got to know the poor chump. If you saw ""Charlie's Angels"", you probably had a better, more inventive time. (Ouch!)",1086048000,,1817,4.576687116564417
1204671,4,B00000F3GI,"Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrel star in this modern update of the 70's super cop TV show.  Overall, the film's concept was solid even if the execution wasn't so.
THE STORY
Sgt. Dan ""Hando"" Harrelson (Jackson) recruits and trains a team of L.A. cops for their elite S.W.A.T. division and must lead them into the field when an ultra-rich European crime leader puts out a $100 million prize to the person that gets him out of prison, of which there are MANY takers.
THE COOL STUFF
The trailers pretty much showed the great stuff.  Watching the S.W.A.T. team take on all the baddies during the SECOND HOUR of the film once the bounty is put out was probably some of THE best action you'll see in any film as the bad guys come up with bold and ingenious ways to try to collect the bounty.  Awesome stuff.
Best Scenes

1. The helicopter attack
2. The motorcade attack
3. The Bridge Fight
THE CRITIQUE
The most frustrating thing about the movie was that it took them a WHOLE HOUR to set up the best parts.  The movie is easily broken up into two parts:  HOUR ONE focuses on Hando putting the team together and training them (which is at parts fun but otherwise blah) and HOUR TWO which focuses on them trying to deal with the guys trying to bust out the evil French cartel leader (which is when all the awesome happens).  Basically, if the team had been built up in a half hour and the next hour half focused on the S.W.A.T action the movie would have been a lot better.  The movie basically looked like a souped up TV show pilot, which would be cool on its own, but is not really there for the big screen.  To put it bluntly, the pacing was horrible, hour one was pretty boring and hour two rocked.
THE DVD EXTRAS
While the movie itself may have lacked a little the DVD extras are just light years beyond a lot of the other new releases out there, especially the sound editing features here.  Here's what we get:
1. Director and Cast Commentary Track
2. Screenwriters and Technical Consultants Commentary Track
3. ""Anatomy of a Shootout"" - 8  minute featurette about filming the bank shootout scene including the contrast in camera styles (news coverage format vs. traditional screen format)
4. ""SWAT - TVs Original Supercops"" -  6  minute retro featurette on the original 70's TV show including interviews with the original cast
5. ""The Making of SWAT"" - 21 minute feature on the movie including information on casting, the characters, real life SWAT training, the SWAT lifestyle and SWAT equipment.
6. 8 deleted scenes (mostly rubbish scenes)
7. ""6th Street Bridge:  Achieving the Improbable"" -  5 minute featurette on making the Bridge Scene including CGI and live action shots.
8. ""Sound & Fury:  Sounds of SWAT"" -  Deluxe extras including a 4 minute featurette on the sound editing for the gun fights plus various mini features on the guns used in the film including the Kimber handgun, AK-47, MP5 and M16, PLUS a sound editing breakdown on 4 scenes in the film.  AWESOME feature!!!
9. ""Gag Reel"" -  3 minute blooper reel, we've seen better...
10. Filmographies for Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez and LL Cool J
11. Trailers for ""Bad Boys II,"" TV Action Favorites (Charlie's Angels, SWAT, Starsky & Hutch, The Rookies and Police Woman Season DVDs), ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico,"" ""Radio,"" ""Underworld"" and ""Big Fish"" DVDs
THE VERDICT
Overall the movie itself fits in well into the weekend rental category.  The movie pacing wasn't all that but all the awesome action in the second hour will wake you up and puts this movie over into the ""passing"" category.  If you're into guns you'll love this movie and the DVD features make this a real keeper if you're into this stuff.  Otherwise you can just file this in the ""okay to rent"" category.

Of course not!  We wanna see stuff blow up!  Unfortunately, SWAT just doesn't deliver in the blow-it-up or burn-it-down department.

While SWAT is not the worst movie in the world, it certainly doesn't rank in the ""just for fun action flick"" genre.  Rather, I would place it neatly in the ""Saturday afternoon, rainy weather, nothing to do"" category.",1084752000,,915,4.870967741935484

 Judging from the review from the guy in England, this has to appeal to us in the US! Wild shoot em ups, some close to realistic SWAT tactics, lots of guns, lots of sex and cussing! PERFECT. My wife did make me sit through Chocolat again though. Sometimes a man just wants to watch an action movie. SWAT fit the bill better than most ""action"" movies currently out. I enjoyed it.

This movie was seemed to have been written by some mediocre middle school student for a ""Creative"" writting assigment. The best thing about this whole movie was these model looking actors to keep both the women(F.Y.I. Collin Farrel) and the men( F.Y.I. Michelle Rodregez)  almost  paying attention to the movie. You can tell by the way that Collin has his shirt off alot in the movie and the fact that Michelle is this strong female role model who can take care of herself, which by the way makes her even more appealing to guys.

I thought the action scenes were wonderful, and that is what the two stars are for; but the acting just didn't impress me that much.  The villain wasn't evil enough and was very weak, and we have already seen the ""partner that turns bad act.""  I took all the good police movies and turned it into something cheesy and mediocre.

1204727,4,B00000F3GI,"Whether they go the route of parody or stick true to the original source material, Hollywood has about a 25% success record of making successful films from television serieses. (...) The movie S.W.A.T. is loosely based upon the flash-in-the-pan television series by the same name from the 1970s and is one of the few based-upon-a-tv-movies that actually works well.
The movie stars Colin Farrell as a former S.W.A.T. member who is demoted after being involved in a successful hostage rescue operation which resulted in a civilian being wounded. Farrell's partner quits the force, but Farrell stays on and takes a huge career demotion working in ""the cage"" (the weapons check out place). He's eventually picked up by Sgt. Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) to be a part of a new Los Angeles S.W.A.T. team. The team bonds, has a minor assignment, then gets involved with the transportation of an international crimelord who was discovered and arrested because of a broken tail light.  The crime boss offers $100,000,000 to anyone who can successfully free him and all the thieves, gangs, and thugs go wild.
I was pleasantly surprised while watching the movie and I really enjoyed watching S.W.A.T. There are two main reasons for that.  First off, S.W.A.T. is one of the few movies based on a television show that actually works. The movie is different from the show, yet remains fairly true to the spirit. Not only that, but the movie feels like you're watching a huge television show, complete with places where television commercials could have been placed.  Besides that, S.W.A.T. is also a movie that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. The movie is a huge action picture and it has no intentions of being anything but that.  It doesn't pretend to be anything totally new and original.  Since the film doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, it works well and at times seems surprisingly realistic.
Other than a few innuendos, the movie has no sexual content. There is a lot of violence, but none of it gory or all that graphic. There is a lot of foul language and that's the main thing that keeps the movie from being completely ""family friendly"".
S.W.A.T. is not a movie that everyone is going to like. However, if your in the mood for a decent action picture that doesn't seem too silly, you might want to watch S.W.A.T.",1080259200,,2336,4.786600496277916

I kept thinking maybe they were setting us up with this paint-by-numbers plot, only to throw in some huge twist at the end, but no such luck.  This was one of the few movies I've seen where I was able to predict each and every event that was going to unfold with nauseating accuracy.  Even this review is generic, for cying out loud.  Yes, this movie was so bland that it actually infects everything it touches and renders it disgustingly uninteresting.  Case in point;  I used to have a sense of humor and an active social life before the day I watched this movie.  Ever since then,  all I can think about are state bailment laws, APA format, Leon Uris, and fluctuating interest rate trends on home equity loans.  My friends have all alienated me due to my incessant rambling about stuff nobody cares about.  Even now, I ramble on.  Don't you just want to shoot me?  Don't let this happen to you.

Continuity problems abound and it is hard to suspend one belive in reality to be able to accept much of what you will see.  Special effects are actually OK, about 3 stars.  The main problem was that we kept finding ourselves checking the DVD status to see how long it was until the end of the movie.
Finally with about 30 minutes left, it started to get real interesting.
The movie became interesting enough to almost ignor its worst contnuity problem of all.  The SWAT guys in two cars THAT are Ttraveling almost bumper to bumper and then suddenly they are so far apart, that the helocopter can't even tell the lead car where the second car is.  I just let out an AAH for its stupidy.
There is no nudity, no simulated sex and no grotesque spurting blood.  There is moderate swearing including the F word.

1204733,4,B00000F3GI,"I've noticed S.W.A.T hasn't got that many positive reviews which I think is kinda sad.  Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell make a good duo in this fast paced action cop thriller.  Of course, another interesting thing about this movie is that unlike many cop related flicks, this one has a pg 13 rating.  Here's a run-down of the story.  Farrell is Jim Street who works on the swat team and his partner is Gambles.  Gambles is a troublemaker and Jim always covers up for his mistakes.  In the beginning of the movie, Gambles disobeyed the cheif's order and b/c of this a hostage gets shot and is sueing the state.  The cheifs has both men removed from the team, but since Jim was very cooperative with the cheif, he was given a chance to redeem himself.  This leads to a falling out between the two partners.  Luckily for Jim, Hondo(Samuel L. Jackson) the veteran swat leader was asked to assemble a team.  Hondo after watching Jim during tryouts was impressed with his abilities and decides that Jim was the perfect guy for the team b/c he had the skills and he disliked the chief just as much as he did.  During recruiting, Hondo selects Chris Sanchez, a woman who takes no crap from any one and has been trying for a long time to get on.  Chris is Michelle Rodriguez (""The Fast and the Furious""), James Todd Smith (L.L. Cool J), Brian Van Holt and Josh Charles completes the team.
The pressure really is on Hondo b/c if he can't deliver a good time he and Jim are not kicked out of swat but off the force pd.
For a long while, we see the swat team going thru training and celebrating after training.  Then the cheif put the team thru an real operation and they passed in flying colors.  Finally after countless hours training and reaching the level of expectation from the cheif.  The team gets their first assignment which is to escort a french drugdealer into the federal custody.  However, that turned out to be harder than they imaged.  The guy made 100,000 bond to help him escape.  As you would expect alot of people took him up on that offer but shockingly the people we is associated with are two former swat members and one of them was Gambles.  This lead to alot of finger pointing about who would be next to sell-out and help the guy.  The team was able to stop them from flying away after surviving shootings coming from a line of thugs.  The former partners fight each other which lead to Gambles getting ran over by a train, the other guy kills himself and the french drugdealer is back in custody.  If you read this review and still not sure if you want to buy it, then at least rent it.  I would recommend it.",1078272000,,2628,4.395445134575569

It's always risky to rehash ""beloved"" television shows. Especially when they weren't really beloved, and were more like a blip on the TV radar years ago.
Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell bring the right amount of testosterone to their roles. Josh Charles (Sports Night) is well cast as their partner with a secret. In fact, an overall strong cast.

1204797,3,B00000F3GI,"First watching ""SWAT"", I was expecting something completely predictable, the usual summer fare that never stands up to its overhyped release. And perhaps this film fits that description, as it is a two-hour long clichee mixed in with every cop stereotype there is, but I have to admit that it was not that bad. Although I do not like to make comparisons, this film is on the same level as ""Bad Boys 2"", with one major difference: ""SWAT"" is pretty entertaining, while ""BB2"" fell flat on its face in every sense of filmmaking.
The actors here are the usual gaggle of predictability, but Colin Farrel is actually pretty good, and not as over-the-top as I was expecting him to be. The rest of the stereotypes play their roles fine, without anyone standing out or completely stinking the place up.
The plot is a little different for a summer film, namely because there seems to be one. The film could easily be split into two halves, the first being the recruitment and training of the new team, and the second being their first action, involving a Frenchman who offers a $100 Million bounty to whoever can help him escape from prison. This of course brings the greedy hoods out of the woodwork, and much shooting ensues.
There is nothing new in this movie, but overall, it is pretty decent, much better than alot of the summer fare, including that other overhyped cop flick of the summer of 2003.",1077667200,,1392,4.6396761133603235
1204798,4,B00000F3GI,"Clark Johnson has taken a mediocre old t.v. series and turned it into an above average actioner.  S.W.A.T. suffers most when it goes through it's ""let's see who makes the team"" moves, but once it kicks in, it's a high octane action flick.  Some thoughts to consider:
*Is anyone else getting tired of movies being ""promotional soundtracks""?  There's so much junk music interjected in this movie and one knows it was put there to attract the teenies and sell records.  It's a total distraction in this movie; what ever happened to good old fashioned musical scores that complemented the movie rather than make you want to turn the volume down?
*Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Larry Poindexter, Barry Van Horn, Jeremy Renner, and Olivier Martinez, all did great jobs in their underwritten roles, but Josh Charles didn't quite have the strength to pull off his ""surprise"" twist.
*The plane landing on the bridge was pretty original and exciting.

1204799,2,B00000F3GI,"S.W.A.T. is a typical summer action movie - several big set pieces with little coherent plot or character development.  As such, it succeeds fairly well.  Samuel L. Jackson stars as the team head, Sgt. Hondo, who returns to the force to help burnish the tarnished image of the Los Angeles S.W.A.T.  He assembles a team of misfits, including Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriquez, and LL Cool J.  The team trains and is thrown into the field just as an international crime figure (Olivier Martinez) is captured in LA and is to be transported to a remote dessert prison.  This transport mission is complicated greatly when the fugitive offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.
The movie features a few good action scenes, including a Lear jet trying to take off from a bridge, and the dialogue includes a few funny jokes.  However, S.W.A.T. never gains much traction, largely because of the generic characters and plot.  TV director Clark Johnson (The Shield, Third Watch) helms, and his apparent lack of vision is a major debit.  With such a great cast, a good basic plot idea, and a large budget, S.W.A.T. should have been fantastic, but it ends up being a disappointment that will likely be forgotten quickly.
Extras: A potentially fun commentary track with the director and cast (sans Colin Farrel) goes nowhere as the director obviously recorded his commentary separately from the cast.  The result is a disjointed and joyless commentary track.",1077408000,,1453,4.922131147540983

As the title suggests, the focus is on the LA SWAT team.  A veteran of the LA police force is given the opportunity to create his own unit and he picks five of the best to join him.

1204865,1,B00000F3GI,"I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to blockbuster summer movies.  I don't expect the greatest scripts or characters or plot, I just want to be entertained.  SWAT let me down on all accounts and was practically begging for me to see its many flaws.
The movie is good at the beginning, though.  It opens with bank robbers taking hostages and the SWAT team moving in and taking out the robbers one by one.  Colin Ferrel's character disobeys orders but turns on his partner in order to stay on the SWAT team.  Then the movie begins and that's when it breaks down.
Samuel L Jackson arrives on the scene as a supposed ex-SWAT member who is brought back to restore dignity to the LAPD.  All this is covered in one line uttered by Jackson's superior, who happens to hate him and hopes he fails.  I have no clue why a separate SWAT team was needed to be formed when the regular SWAT team seemed to be functioning quite well.
Jackson is allowed to choose his own team and much is made in the movie of him choosing each member.  Jackson's superior warns that if Jackson picks the wrong team, it'll end his career.
The middle of the movie involves the training of the team.  On the way home from training, they stumble on a worldwide fugitive.  Through a forced and unbelievable plot, it becomes Jackson's young, inexperienced SWAT team's responsibility to transport the prisoner.  Here's where I started having doubts.
The extended climax of the movie involves Jackson, Ferrell, Michelle Rodriquez and LL Cool J trying to transport the prisoner while all types of thugs try to break him free.
There is a plot twist at the end where Jackson's team choosing ability is called into question, yet this has no repercussions in the movie, and it also calls into doubt the entire first half of the film when Jackson carefully chose his team.  How bad could he be?
Why is this young inexperienced SWAT team in charge of the prison transfer.  Is that what SWAT teams really do.  I didn't think so.
The final fight between Ferrell and the last bad guy is horribly filmed in the darkness of a train yard.  One minute the characters are in the open, the next they are on a train car.  The editing is jumpy and confusing, and I didn't really care what happened.
When I think of SWAT, I think of the beginning of the movie when they save hostages from a terrorist situation with their long-range shooting and special skill.  The entire climax of the movie is about cops transporting a prisoner, certainly not worthy of a SWAT team.  This is a bad movie with no character development.

After a hostage situation goes wrong, Jim Street is pulled from his SWAT team and must work in the ""cage.""  When a new team needs to be formed by a sergeant coming out of retirement, Street is one of those picked.  The new crack team must train together and learn all about the job.  Problems arise when drug dealer and general lowlife Alex Montel is apprehended and offers $100 million to whoever can get him out.  This brings anyone in Los Angeles who can wield a gun to try and get him out.  The new SWAT team must figure out a way to transport him to maximum security.  This is a full-blown action movie that will keep you riveted.  The scene with a plane landing on the Sixth Street Bridge, while obviously CGI, is a great example of the action.
  Colin Farrell stars as Jim Street, the cocky SWAT officer who works his way back onto the team.  This is basically the same role as in The Recruit.  Samuel L.

OK, here is the bad news -- this film is so bad, so terrible, so embarrasingly awful...you cant ignore it-- it just would not end. Infact my therapist told me to write this review so i could get rid of it!!!ok thats a joke but you get the drift.
I bought the DVD, thinking with a class of actors like this i cant fail. Wrong, this is the type of movie when watched in a cinema makes you wonder whether the ceiling tiles  are black or just painted black or how high is that? or other important questions in a cinema like why is this seat stopping blood going to my legs?  you get the message...anything other then the film. Dont get me wrong, I mean i can ignore the glaring errors in films, i had no issue with Terminator3 (armed people get into top secret military base to warn daddy not to turn the machine on)and love them for it all,  i can ignore almost anything...but please spare me from this. it has nothing to redeem it. It starts off well enough, people introduced, the usual...but suddenly spirals into nowhere. i mean who is the french actor. PLEASE, make wine, cheese, bread anything other then act!!.where did you find this guy? As if America did not have enough issues with the french...this guy is presented as a sample of good french acting.
as for Samuel... i thought id never see a film with this man in it i did not like and buy. This man is a God among actors..cmon, he is excellent, a master of the art (certainly wasn't in the same trailer giving tips during the filming to the french guy thats for sure) BUT not in this film...what the hell is he doing in this movie. i got the distinct impression he wanted out half way thru..and it showed. There is loads of now dated only a black man understand a black man, my brover, type of discussions and serious knuckly touching, deep looks with his other swat buddy, friend whatever. OK, can we  move to the 21st century PLEASE!!!! Farell is doing his best but then im Irish and would say that, but again he was obviously with Britney at the time because this is all surface and no detail. I would not be a big farrell supporter but to be fair his accent (well to me anyway held out) The angry lady is well,(Michelle Rodriguez, i think - sorry about the spelling)  angry but she does smile in this and she plays her part with a bit of grace and style. LL is the only suprise for me acting wise i was very impressed, he had a good mix of serious and humour...
but to the fim...if you want to save your hard earned money...dont get this....no plot, no story, no acting, remember even Studios dial 911 and the certainly should have with this film....still that just my opinion...",1075075200,,3171,4.349662162162162

1204871,3,B00000F3GI,"""S.W.A.T"" is a surprisingly standard cop flick, a throwback to a calmer if not recent cinematic era. It is still stuffed full of guns, villains and mayhem, but unlike ""Bad Boys II,"" or even the excellent ""Training Day,"" the movie does not paint an urban world teetering on the brink - criminal masterminds run amok, but Los Angeles isn't quite burning. It seems bizarre to consider ""S.W.A.T"" comforting, but it is.
Colin Farrell is Jim, a former S.W.A.T member relegated to scrub duty after he and his rogue partner, Brian (Jeremy Renner), break protocol in a hostage negotiation.  Sam Jackson is, yes, Hondo, chief of a newly formed crew that resurrects Jim's career from the gun cage. LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez play Jim's buds, while Josh Charles, the do-good cop, is Jim's main shooting rival on the crew. Director Clark Johnson charts the crew's training - it amounts to a recruiting poster, set to a video game soundtrack - a circle changeup, of sorts, to the usual hit-the-ground-gunning structure of most modern cop films.
The crew eventually is dispatched to handle the prison transfer of a Eurotrash crime boss (Olivier Martinez) who brags, in the movie's most quotable line, that he will offer ""one hundred meellion dollars!"" to any brave crook willing to bust him free. Half the city's loose cannons are up for it, including Brian, now off the force, who has a connection inside Hondo's crew. In a twist, Martinez's character is not a supervillain of limitless cunning and strength, but an ineffectual, well-funded heel, pout-lipped and soft-bellied as Brian escorts him through sewers to the rendezvous: a private jet waiting on an LA bridge.
Renner was unknown to me, but his few scenes with Farrell crackle with energy. The face of an insolent cherub, he makes for an appropriately smug sellout. Jackson, for once, is the calming influence collecting a paycheck, and ""S.W.A.T"" is better off without his bravado. And while Farrell has not yet proven his acting chops - we'll have to wait for Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" - there is an offhand, understood masculinity that recalls a young Mickey Rourke, or Sean Penn. Only Rodriguez, notching another asexual sidekick role to her club, is a bust.
Cynics might call ""S.W.A.T"" inconsequential in that relives the climax from ""Die Hard 2"" and generally avoids the graceless, graphic violence of its 2003 competitor ""Bad Boys II."" I far preferred it; unoriginal as the movie is, ""S.W.A.T"" is the very idea of escapist entertainment without the sideline helping of head wounds and nihilism. Action junkies should eat it up.",1074038400,2,2585,4.983796296296297
1204872,2,B00000F3GI,"The DVD cover and back say: ""Best cop film since 'Training Day'"" and ""A solid action movie with a lot of heart and soul"". EEEHHHH!! Wrong!! What the heck does ""heart and soul"" mean in the context of this whoooosh-boom-ratata kind of movie?
This film is like Top Gun, except without the class of Tony Scott as director. Let's see, the first hour of the movie is almost exclusively a corporate training video for potential SWAT recruits. There were obviously lots of ex-SWATers on hand to ensure authenticity. So after the hour is over, we learn there are bad egg members of SWAT too. Wow. Like the first 10 minutes didn't already spoil that. The film moves along at an OK pace from then on, but it's too-little-too-late to engross us anymore, because we look at the DVD running time and realise, well it's time to wrap this baby up soon, so you can rattle off all your predictions on what will happen.
But here's why I felt like I was watching some promotional how-to video as opposed to an action flick: The score (music), lighting, and camera work that accompany some of the training scenes are way too pretentious and obvious to captivate the viewer. Within seconds you start to ask yourself, why am I supposed to feel the suspense, when the characters in this movie are all just training with paint guns? It's just silly. This is an example of a movie that puts to much effort into honestly portraying the training of a member of a SWAT team and not enough into, hey, it's an action flick!! You've got Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, LL Cool J, and Michelle Rodriguez (who is becoming a B-movie actress thanks to not challenging herself to do more gritty work like her 'Girlfight' debut), and Olivier Martinez. Let the viewers have some fun. We're the ones who pay for this shlock.
Let me put it like this: If I decide to make a documentary about baking my homemade christmas cookies, perhaps I can move and rivet the viewer with all the meticulous detailed work and effort involved in shaping and baking the cookies. But if this is a movie to be consumed (pun intended) by the mass audience, then I'll have to figure out how to make it entertaining. So if S.W.A.T. is supposed to be a documentary or training video, well hey, mission accomplished. But we're making an action movie, right? That's based on a TV series, which had a plot occasionally too, right?
The DVD: I actually liked the deleted scenes. They added some sorely lacking humour as well as some of that ""heart and soul"" that would have given the characters zest. As for the commentaries, I am of the opinion that the director's commentary and that of the actors should have been on separate tracks, because not only were they recorded separately, but their moods are totally conflicting. Johnson's comments are low-key details and thoughts, and the actors are boisterous. Weird to listen to. The 'making of' was just plain annoying; I couldn't hear what anyone was saying, because the dumb music was given priority over the comments.
In closing: If Tony Scott had directed this, it would have been R-rated, and may have not made as much money at the theaters. But he would have lent the movie the authenticity that the producers wanted without alienating the viewers who came to see some good old fashioned action.
Rent it first. If you like it, ignore my comments and buy it.",1074038400,2,3347,4.636363636363637
1204873,5,B00000F3GI,"A recent letter to the editors of Entertainment Weekly challenged Colin Farrell's ranking on their annual ""Power List."" Some guy from Illinois claimed that the Irish heartthrob didn't even have enough power to make him see one of Colin's movies.
This person also took swipes at ""Daredevil"" and ""S.W.A.T.""
I took that as a challenge--and having sat through BOTH films, have to say that EW was indeed incorrect.
They should have put Colin Ferrel at NUMBER ONE on that list!
""S.W.A.T."" is rip-roaring, non-stop, pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat action from beginning to end. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since ""Minority Report,"" which ALSO starred Mr. Farrell.

When you rent this, are you thinking you will see an Academy Award hopeful?  Is it chock full of Golden Globe performances?  Do you really demand full character development in a shoot-em up movie?  If you do, then simply don't rent this DVD.
If you are thinking this movie will blow you away, it won't.  But it is good enough to spend the money on a rental.  Don't believe the harsh reviews on it though.  Those people are just expecting WAY too much from a simple action film.
That's the best way to describe the film:  simple.
Although, the reviewer that comments about all of the gangs magically coming together to take on the police force for the money is spot on.  That was way too stupid, even for this flick.

1204936,1,B00000F3GI,"This movie is now on my top 10 list of worst movies ever. I am embarrassed for any other reviewer who gave this movie more then 2 stars. I finished watching this movie and was thinking I would come here and get a least some entertainment out of it by reading other mocking reviews. Where are they!!!???!!!! This movie averages 4 1/2 stars here?! I must be out of touch?!
This movie trys to glamorize the S.W.A.T. team ala Top Gun. Collin Farrel is the the young hot shot looking for redemption/glory after he is kicked off the SWAT team initially. Samuel Jackson is the cliche ""Been there done that"" Sergeant who is putting together his own ""special SWAT squad"" and of course wants Farrel. Jackson also recruits a slew of other cliche characters. And speaking of cliches this movie just has one cheezey one-liner after another. I can't name another movie with more one-liners. If you don't vomit on the one-liners you will when you watch the team train and bond together.
Anyway there is this Eurotrash Frenchy arms dealing drug kingpin (which I find hard to believe seeings how his government would have the corner on this market, the arms dealing that is) who is arrested and offers anyone 100 million to break him out. Well that leads to my favorite part of the whole movie and probly the most absurd scene in movie history. There is a scene where a decoy convoy that is suppose to be transporting the Frenchy to a Federal Pen is ambushed by every gang in LA. The Bloods, the Vatos, the Vietnemese, they were all there to represent and break the Frenchy out for the 100 million dollars (Dr. Evil laugh)! It was the ""It's a Small World"" of gangs vs. the police in LA on that one block. How all the gangs came together and how they thought they would all collect the reward escapes me.
Anyway Jackon's ""Magnificent Seven"" SWAT team is called on to bring in the bad guy when he gets away.
To sum it up the movie was one big plot hole after another with a very healthy serving of one-liners. Get this show if you want to watch something with NO basis in reality.",1073606400,5,2061,4.455026455026455

S.W.A.T. is plagued with problems from the start. The film is chock full of plot holes and gaps, it's filled with characters you know extremely little about and to be honest, the action is that intense. There's nothing here we haven't sen a million times before, and there's really no unbelievable directing flare to speak of either.
There are some talented actors in this one, but it feels like they're just riding the wave through it. Also, there's plenty of corny cop lines in the dialogue and some cheesy music to boot.
Overall, there's really little to like in this one. A couple good one liners and a decent explosion or two, but that's about it.

Predictable from the offset, the story runs like a bad plot from a cheesy Cable TV series.  Indeed it actually works more like the pilot to a new cop show where a group, carefully selected for their fighting skills, though shunned by their piers, form the ultimate team, make good, prove their critics wrong & never forget to look good even in the toughest situation.  Make sure you represent your strongest audience markets by including key ethnic minorities in the team, plus throw in a few double-crosses & personal demons to fight and surely you can't go wrong can you?
Unfortunately you can, as what could have been a kick-ass action flick dumbs-down yet again to be awarded the lucrative 12A (in the UK), resulting in what amounts to nothing more than a poor imitation of the A-Team on steroids.  With the most pointless script of the year to boot there is little to redeem S.W.A.T. aside from some pacey set pieces & the ever watchable Samuel L. Jackson.
Standout Scene:  Amongst the dirge of pointless popcorn moments comes a corny high when the team kick back, bond with a few drinks, & attempt to hum the theme to the original 70's S.W.A.T. TV series.",1073433600,,1261,4.63677130044843
1204992,3,B00000F3GI,"I honestly did not have high expectations for ""S.W.A.T.""-I figured any picture based upon the old T.V. series would end up being an explosive film that lacked character and plot.  From the opening scenes, however, I must say that I was impressed by Clark Johnson's carefully planned opening sequence.  Based upon the N. Hollywood Shootout, the opening is shot in fractured frames, giving the feel of amateur or news station photography.  Johnson jumps back and forth between these slow-motion frames and live action, contrasting the difference between being at the scene of the crime and being at home watching the footage on the news.  The opening sequence is absolutely thrilling and I really had high hopes after watching it.
Enter Samuel L. Jackson.  While his performance is strong (as can be expected), the plot just did not allow any of the actors any breathing room.  We have a classic plot line: an old-timer hero of the S.W.A.T. squad (Jackson) assembling an elite group of somewhat problematic team members (including the ""bad"" female) to improve the image of the force.  While they are battling the most dangerous of criminals, they are also dealing with the bureaucracy and politics of the job.  Colin Farrell plays the rookie who has as much charisma and skill as the seasoned pro.  I quickly became tired of Colin's ""hard-to-get"" attitude, however.  And he gave up being a Navy Seal to become a S.W.A.T. member?
I was encouraged by a somewhat different plot line-trying to transfer a dangerous criminal while warding off other criminals who are trying to collect a reward for preventing them from succeeding.  The moment the ""revenge"" angle gets introduced to the plot, however, ""S.W.A.T."" falls into a classic plot trap and loses my interest.  The last twenty to thirty minutes of the film drag in my opinion.  All in all, ""S.W.A.T."" is not a bad film for what it is-an expensive action film with no heart.",1073347200,,1922,4.913312693498452

It starts off like it's gonna be a great movie. The performances are good, the tension is good and the story is headed in an interesting direction.
But then it sort of gets derailed. Not in a hugely bad way, but in bad enough of a way. First of all, the story is set aside and half of the movie is taken up with TRAINING! Sure, it's neat to see the S.W.A.T. officers at work and good research was done into the weapons and tactics, but the story suffers from this. What could have been a richer and deeper story, becomes a flash in the pan ending with not a whole lot of feeling to it.
What could have been an exciting and conflicting story between Jim Street (Farrell) and his ex-partner Brian Gamble (Renner) becomes just a handful of scenes that never got delved into and so the conclusion doesn't hold a lot of power.
So, I guess my pain problem with the movie was scripting and structure.
It's an interesting movie and worth a look, but falls short of anything more than that.",1073260800,,1032,4.324742268041237

I put those feelings aside because I realized that there isn't any actor who could play the role of Luca, the way Mark Shera did. However when it came time for cameos they could have at least tried to get all the surviving members of the tv series to appear in the movie.
When I read that one of the special features on the DVD was going to discuss the original tv series, I figured that they were finally going to give credit to the actors who made the show great and fun to watch. I was very angry when they only focused on the two actors who made cameos in the movie. They showed clips that included the whole cast but failed to even mention who the actors were, what part they played, or what impact they had on making the show a hit.

1204998,3,B00000F3GI,"""S.W.A.T."" has at least one thing going for it - it's a lot better than the old TV series it is based on. Unlike most other recent action films, it tries hard give a little depth to it characters, but it ultimately fails because the script is as formula as they come and because the events it portrays are utterly unbelievable.
As the movie opens, a S.W.A.T. team has been dispatched to the scene of a horrific bank robbery / hostage situation. The team saves the day. In the course of doing so, one of the officers wounds a hostage. That officer and his partner, Jim Street [Colin Farrell], are called on the carpet because the victim of the gunshot is suing for `millions of dollars'. The officer who fired the shot quits and becomes a vindictive drunk, and  Street gets demoted to doing menial tasks. [How's that for formula? Movies have been going this route since `Dirty Harry"" in 1971.] Salvation for Street comes in the form of `Hondo' Harrelson [Samuel Jackson], who has been called back to S.W.A.T. to improve the department's tarnished image. He chooses Street and several other officers to make an `elite' team. Meanwhile, an international gangster [Oliver Martinez] is arrested, and as he is lead off to jail, offers $100,000,000 to anyone who can bust him out. Suddenly all the bad guys come out of the woodwork hoping for the reward. As in all lazily written scripts, the bad guys have all this information and equipment that in real life they could not possibly have. The elite team has its hands full, but it's all just an excuse for another series of car chases and explosions.
I don't mean to be so `down' on ""S.W.A.T"". As such movies go these days, it's sometimes exciting. My laments these days are two-fold. The first is that modern action movies play like video games. The second is that they take themselves so seriously. Since the scenario is so outlandish, where is the humor? Where are the inside jokes? Do the people who make this stuff truly believe they are mirroring reality? Or do they believe that they are reflecting what the audience thinks  reality to be?",1073174400,,2090,4.661246612466124

The training sequences are spot-on if you like that kind of thing (which I do) and the good old fashioned mayhem is top-notch. There are a few good jokes that kept me laughing. I mean, come on, ""Lakers purple""? That's good. And the teeny tiny hint of military humor was great fun for the Navy girl in me. (Even though Colin Farrell is waaaay to young to have retired from the SEALs.)

1205000,3,B00000F3GI,"Best:
1) You get to see authentic SWAT tactics as the action scenes were supervised by current and retired team members.
2) The action scenes were the most extreme examples of police life and the big visuals were pretty well done.
3) Those who like character development might like the soap opera nature of the actor's interplay.
4) There's a host of special features including 4 short documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.
Worst:
1) You have to REALLY love cops to love this movie because you're immersed in police life from beginning to end.
2) The non-action scenes often came across as dorky and a little too much like the 1970's TV series.
3) Those who want lots of action may be disappointed with the first half of the movie.
4) The major characters sometimes acted too much like testosterone-soaked studs (even Michelle Rodriguez).
5) The hip-hop soundtrack was loud and intrusive at the wrong times.
Recommendation:
If you prefer real grit in your police dramas, this one may be too much talk and too little action for you. It's likable but not all that memorable (except for the cool airplane landing on the bridge scene).

Unlike a good amount of the summer action movie crop, this actioner actually had something most of them didn't have: regard for human life (and in the case of ""Bad Boys II"", death).  Unlike the cartoonish mayhem of ""Bad Boys II"", we have situations where cops HAVE to deal with the consequences of their actions.  As the film opens, Jim Street (played by Colin Farrell) has been disgraced by the actions of his former partner during a brutal bank robbery and seems to be out of L.A's S.W.A.T. for good.  However, redemption comes in the form of Sgt. Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), who is assembling his own S.W.A.T. unit, made up of a ragtag pack of officers (LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Brian Van Holt, Josh Charles).  No sooner do they earn their stripes as a unit, they end up being put in charge of taking a drug kingpin (Oliver Martinez) to federal prison.  That's easier said than done, when said druglord declares he'll give $100 million to whoever frees him from custody.  Suffice to say, it gets hairy from there.  The ensemble cast here is definitely having fun, and it shows.  The direction by Clark Johnson (who directed several episodes of ""The Shield"", including its shocking first episode) keeps things moving through the first 90 minutes or so, but things do get a little sluggish near the end.  However, it's still worth a rental (even despite the PG-13 rating for such a rough and tumble film like this) and the special features aren't all bad either.

Despite the hammer-headed storyline (even the Thunderbirds couldn't handle a learjet like the pilots in this movie yet the chopper pilots never had any idea how to auto-rotate their craft during an emergency) and cliched characters, the film was comfortable to watch due in part to the solid performances of the actors and stuff does blow up real good.

1205052,3,B00000F3GI,"S.W.A.T. is better than most of the cop movies of recently. In Bad Boys 2, Will Smith and Martin Lawence chase the bad guys without even caring about innocent civilians getting hurt. Meanwhile in S.W.A.T. Colin Farrell's partner shoots a hostage and he doesn't want anything to do with him after that. If Will Smith shot a hostage in Bad Boys 2 in order to shoot the bad guy Martin Lawence would congradulate him on a job well done.
  Sure S.W.A.T. does have some brainless summer movie action but it still manages to be smarter and more realistic than Bad Boys 2. It's also smart how it doesn't over-due playing the theme song from the tv show.  That could've been a annoying and a bad movie based on a tv show would play the theme song through the whole movie. Colin Farrell and Samual L. Jackson have good chemestry as well. I would've liked to have seen the Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriguez character get together though. They have good chemestry but the script doesn't let them  act on that.
  I liked how the bad guy gets other people even cops to be bad by offering a million dollars to who ever breaks him out. When I first heard that was the plot, I found it silly but it actually works. You don't know when someone is going to attack the S.W.A.T. inorder to rescue the bad guy and get the money. You don't even know who will either. So I found that cool. The movie doesn't depend on a bunch of big explosions like most  action movies these days seem to depend on.

1205055,3,B00000F3GI,"After a series of embarrassing incidents in the press, the Los Angeles Police Department charges a veteran S.W.A.T. officer, Captain Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), with the job of creating a new special unit that will not make mistakes. Hondo chooses a motley bunch of tough police officers, some out of favor with their superiors, for his elite team: Jim Street (Colin Farrell), ""Deke"" Kay (LL Cool J), Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), and T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles). Shortly after the team has  qualified, an international crime kingpin (Olivier Martinez) in the LAPD's custody publicly offers $100 million dollars to whomever can secure his freedom, bringing every hoodlum in Hollywood out of the woodwork to try to bust him out.

""S.W.A.T."" is based on the 1970s television show of the same name. Fans of the show will recognize the names of Hondo, Street, Deke, and T.J. McCabe. One of the team is now a woman and an additional officer has been added. And there you have the modernized movie version of ""S.W.A.T."". Unfortunately, modernized doesn't mean improved. It takes an hour for the film's main action to start. The filmmakers try to spend that time developing the characters, but there isn't much to develop. An action film with little additional substance can't get away with nearly an hour's lull in the action. Even Samuel L. Jackson's imposing presence and Colin Farrell's cuteness aren't enough to overcome the stagnation. The level of script-writing in ""S.W.A.T."" is very much like television. Whenever the characters spoke, I got the feeling that I was watching a slightly cheesy prime-time cop drama. The film's dialogue has the hokey quality that the t.v. show did. This could be intentional, but a big-budget theatrical release doesn't seem worth the time or money if it can do no better than 30-year-old television. I'm giving ""S.W.A.T."" a marginal recommendation because the French crime kingpin, played by hunky Olivier Martinez, is kind of interesting -I wish he had more to do- and because, once the movie gets rolling, there is one -and only one- creative action sequence. ""S.W.A.T."" has an appealing cast and a smidgen of creativity, but it's best as a rental so you will have something  else to entertain yourself with during the film's abundant dull moments. Not in any way groundbreaking, as the television show was.

The DVD: Bonus features include: 2 commentaries, one by director Clark Johnson and the cast and one by the screenwriters and technical consultant; ""Anatomy of a Shootout"" featurette that describes the making of the film's opening sequence.; a mini-documentary on the original ""S.W.A.T."" tv show.; a ""making of "" documentary; a featurette about creation of ""6th Street Bridge"" sequence; featurette on film's sound effects; bloopers; and cast filmographies. If you're really interested in the movie, this is a pretty good DVD package. If you only have time to watch one extra, try the ""making of"" documentary.

Give it due, the film has good suspense, thrills and a nice cast to boot. But there's nothing new or original about this film. I was expecting some surprises and perhaps a better plotline for this movie, and there isn't.
This cop film based on the successful 1970's TV series has Samuel L. Jackson( a brilliant character actor)a retired police sergeant, giving greenlight to organize a special tactics team for LAPD. The team is a talented group filled with crop crowd like Colin Farrell and LL Cool J. They get the job done, and when a international terrorist is arrested in LA, the criminal offers ""$100 million dollarssss!"" to anyone who will break him out of custody. Soon every lowlife in the city wants the piece of the action, and the SWAT team escorting him to prison now have their jobs pushing to the limit.
I'm sure any action junkie will defenitly will reccomend this film. I'm a action fan, but I look at facts. I look at logic, and maybe a few key thinking now and then. This film lacks originality and is quite predictable. I mean, I know the heroes will save the day by the end, but maybe something different will occur at the climax?

Lowpoints: Absence of one single novel thing.
Conclusion: Unless you were a huge fan of the show, or simply adore Colin Farrell, chances are you'll find SWAT just another action movie. It does not falter or go wrong at any time, but also does not exceed expectations the least bit - enjoy the slam-bam action and laugh at the never-ending flow of humor (how else to keep an audience intrigued but placing handfuls of Sam Jackson/LL Cool J/Collin Farrell puns inbetween relentless action?) - you'd be better off watching 'Heat' or the original '48 Hours' though.",1071360000,,660,5.12037037037037
1205110,2,B00000F3GI,"Clark Johnsons action adventure starts off with a ""save the hostages, kill the bad guys"" mission where SWAT members Jim Street (Colin Farrel) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) break all the rules to save the day. However Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter) relegates them to the gun cage for doing the ""wrong"" thing. Gamble leaves on bad terms with his former partner but Street works his way through six months in the cage to be picked on Sgt. Hondo's (Sam L. Jackson)new swat team, along with LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt.
Their Mission? To escort wanted billionaire Alex Montel (Oliver Martinez) to jail. However when Montel offers $100 million to who ever can bust him out, the new team have their hands full.
In a film like this, you need to have action scenes that blow you away and snappy one liners, but SWAT fails to deliver. Instead theres alot of training sequences and attempted character building.
The action only really kicks in the last half hour and its nothing to write home about.
While the rest of the cast are very ""I got your Back"", Farrel plays more mature and almost makes the film worth watching. Almost. Farrel has so much talent he should pick btter films thatn this and The Recriut. Hopefully ""Alexander"" will shape him into the actor he so nearly is.

1205111,3,B00000F3GI,"People are often complaining about Hollywood these days, saying how commercialized and greedy it's become over the years, and how the quality of films such as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"" are long forgotten. It's true. The most perdinent proof that Hollywood is running out of original ideas is the fact that film executives are constantly giving the thumbs up to remakes of old 60s and 70s TV shows like ""The Brady Bunch"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" Next year we're all going to be sitting through ""Bewitched"" with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. The question is: Does ""Bewitched"" even need a remake?
That's not to say that there aren't original writers out there. Having written a fair share of film screenplays myself, and having read many others, the supply of original scripts is quite high. The demand is not. It's sad when quality films are passed for big-budget extravaganzas with not an ounce of thought and given the green light simply because some overweight pen pusher is considering the zeros.
""SWAT"" is a breath of fresh air from the typical TV show remakes. It's not one of the best films in recent memory, but it's not nearly as cliched or goofy as I had imagined before going to see it. In fact, it's surprisingly gritty - more like an R-rated movie than a PG-13.
The film stars Colin Farrell as Jim Street. In the beginning, Jim is taking part in a routine hostage situation. At first it's being controlled by the police, but then matters become desperate. ""Call in the SWAT,"" a cop says over a radio transmission, and then we see Jim and his five-year partner, Gamble (Jeremy Renner), giving their best efforts.
Gamble injures a hostage with a shot he wasn't supposed to take, though, and Jim and Gamble are reprimanded. Gamble is thrown off the force and Jim is reassigned to the lowly life of a SWAT weapons expert. Six months go by, and Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" (Samuel L. Jackson) gives his machine gun to Jim, who does a great job tweaking around with it. And, as if by luck, Dan is assigned to put together a new SWAT team. He chooses Jim, based on his weapon skills; Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), a tough lady; T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles), the wimpy guy; Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), Jim's enemy on the force; and Deke (LL Cool J), a fast runner, as proved in his introductory sequence.
After the routine training scenes, the action jumpstarts when a foreign kingpin, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) comes to town in hopes of making a name for himself. But that doesn't happen - much to the audiences' surprise - because Alex is arrested for a broken tail light and thrown in jail.
That's how the trouble starts. Alex offers a high payment to anyone who can break him out of jail - and during a prisoner transport, this happens, headed by Gamble and his cronies. Jim and co. are sent after the ex-SWAT member and his gang, in hopes of taking them down before Alex gets out of the country and so on and so forth.
Sounds pretty standard, right? It is. But the film is directed by Clark Johnson in a distinctly grainy style, reminiscent of ""Training Day,"" only a bit softer. And the script doesn't resort to cliches all that often - when you think there's going to be a car chase, or a big shoot-out, nothing happens. Which is actually quite a relief, despite the fact that some audiences may have been expecting something a little bit...more.
Colin Farrell is doing exactly what he did in ""The Recruit,"" acting smart and tough. Michelle Rodriguez is starting to stereotype herself after such flicks as ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""Resident Evil,"" playing tough women in both films, but I suppose that's all she really can play.
The actor who really surprised is an actor who's been around for quite some time: Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is enjoyable, as usual, as the guy who knows everything - a role that usually fits him. But he steals the show from the other actors with his sly coolness that he displayed in ""Pulp Fiction.""
""SWAT"" isn't as goofy as you think it's going to be. It's also not as action-packed as you might expect. If you want another ""Die Hard"" rip-off, look elsewhere. ""SWAT"" is, surprisingly, a pretty smart and character-driven action movie that never resorts to the typical action film cliches.
It's not a great movie, but given the other awful TV show remakes abounding the film market, you could certainly do worse than ""SWAT.""",1070236800,,4378,4.672279792746114
1205112,4,B00000F3GI,"In the beginning, I wasn't that much interested in watching SWAT. But I went anyway, expecting a kind of pilot-of-the-series with lots of endlesse gun-shots, unbelievable car-chases, predictable plot-twists, etc. I was wrong.
SWAT is a very good action movie. The script was written in a way so that the viewer does not increase mental activity even for a second while watching the film. And that's not bad. SWAT is pure action, from beginning to end. There's no emotional elements (well, in fact we get a glimpse of Farrell's character's love life, but that's just a scene), there're no plot-twists or plot-holes that made me role my eyes. You know who's good and who's bad from the start. No surprises. Just go along with the action and everything will be fine.
In the end, the viewer fells he/she was not cheated. This movie doesn't treat the watchers on a condescendent basis, like they were dumb. Collin Farrell (shaved now) and Samuel Jackson are the acting pillars that support the good direction, tailor-made, though not revolutionary, for an action flick.

1205117,2,B00000F3GI,"No, it's not very good but what can be expected of a show based on a dullish 70s (short lived) TV show? There wasn't too much material there to begin with. At least it wasn't based on a Disneyworld Theme Ride.
It begins with a little promise of some real story about SWAT sniper Jim Street (up and coming Irish hottie Colin Farrell, who does an utterly convincing American accent) who has both career and girl friend troubles. Street's lifestyle, apartment etc., are presented realistic for a change -- he's not a fantasy cop living in a condo overlooking the ocean -- and the early action and training scenes when he gets back into SWAT are convincing.
It goes downhill in the 2nd half with an absurd ""caper"" involving a French billionaire drug dealer who offers ONE HUNDRED MEEELYYYION DOLLARS if some thug will bust him out of prison. Oliver Martinex, marginally convincing in last year's ""Unfaithful"" is utterly ridiculous in this role, although he didn't have a chance since the part is written absurdly. He too young, slightly built and ""fashion model-ish"" to be menacing, plus how scary are the FRENCH anyhow?
Samuel L. Jackson and Michelle Rodriguez are wasted in this. Jackson reprises his unexceptional role in ""The Negotiator"", to no great effect, and Rodriguez -- the rare actress who can believably come across as physically tough -- is just a PC addition to the rainbow coalition cast. She is given literally NOTHING to do, not even fire her weapon. There is a vague suggestion that she and Farrell's character will or have hooked up romantically, but something was left on the cutting room floor and this plotline isn't developed. The filmakers clearly haven't got a clue what to do with a female SWAT officer.
The rest of the cast are treated with such indifference, they barely register. Soundtrack is annoying and extremely LOUD, apparently designed for a urban audience close to deafness from listening to very loud boomboxes. This is a hugely irritating trend in action movies lately and is totally out of control.
SWAT units are an interesting part of the police force, and it's too bad that an ORIGINAL (non 70s TV series) script could not have been developed, especially one focusing on female officers in a male dominated arena. This movie lets down in virtually all aspects. Just a by the book, loud action flick with no character development and relying on noisy violence instead of the precision and cleverness one would normally associate with SWAT.

And ""S.W.A.T."" opens with hostage situation just like another Sameul L Jackson film ""The Negotiator.""  Then you realize that director of ""S.W.A.T."" Clark Johnson has not the same skill to show the tension F Gary Grey successfuly did.
Actually, ""S.W.A.T"" is quite entertaining, but what it shows in 2 hours can be seen in such better movies as I mentioned.  There are gun-shots, hard training, friendship and so on, but all of them are thrown into a rather stretched running time of the film that looks like one extended episode of TV cop drama.  And you know that ""S.W.A.T"" is a remake of 70s TV series, and Clark Johnson is known as actor in TV's ""Homicide"" (as Detective Lewis), some of which are directed by him.
The story has potential.  Arrested drug king Tom Cruise-lookalike Olivier Martinez (""Unfaithful"") states before the gathering TV cameras that he will give $100 million to anyone who succeeds in freeing him from the police.  Many greedy guys rejoice in their prospective fortune, and put their makeshift plans into practice.  Interesting, to be sure.
But the film, to reach the boiling point, takes too much time.  It looks as if we have seen two one-hour TV episodes, one ending with ""TO BE CONTINUED,"" and then are plunged into real actions.  So those who love helicopters and shooting have to fidget for a while, waiting for the actions to kick start.
And actions.  They are not bad at all.  In fact, they are competently staged, but nothing unique or innovative.  Some dialogues (including self-referential ones) are interesting, and Sam and Colin give good acting, but they are just standard-issue ones.  You know Sam Jackson's best is not this one (where is Kevin Spacey?)
You also see Josh Charles, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt, and Michelle Rodriguez, politically correct casting, but they have little to do, nor to surprise us.

It was difficult for me to fool myself into thinking I didn't have the major plot points down after the first five minutes.  A friend said something to the effect of ""A movie like that, people stick around for the dialogue, not the plot points.""  It's just unfortunate that the dialogue wasn't more creative.
There was one shining moment of creativity in this movie.  This has been stated about SWAT everywhere from the trailers to capsule reviews, so I'll just tell you this may be a very MILD spoiler.  The question of what might happen if an international criminal offered 100 million dollars to anyone who would get him out of prison was the one thing about this movie that really seemed fresh and original.  Some of the proposed answers to that question were rather disappointing, however, and on a couple levels reinforced stereotypes about people of color in LA.

But hey, by today's standards, the honour of fighting and fallen heroes is a small price to pay for a couple more big explosions and sunken bullet-holes.
Beyond that, I found it a bit less than subtle in these chaotic, hateful times to use a ""frog"", as Samuel L Jackson delicately puts it on more than one occasion, as the number one enemy of the United States police.  Using racial slurs against the number one democratic enemy of America's war?  In a major Hollywood movie?
To take a Michael Moore-esque view on one final note, we see common thugs and low-lives with automatic weapons wounding and killing innocents, and never even question how such dangerous weapons got into their hands, but somehow this is justified  when a bunch of guys in black kill them off one by one.  We've come so far that using violence to counteract violence is the first, last and only solution to the problem.  Obviously, there isn't really any choice in situations like this, but at least question how things have come to the point where there IS no other choice, even in Hollywood films.
Ok this is a movie review, so let's finish with comments about the film itself; cliche action sequences, lukewarm acting, two-dimensional storyline.",1062806400,4,1511,4.7701149425287355

1205214,3,B00000F3GI,"Jackson, Farrell, and the others make this a watchable movie.. They add depth to a shallow story-Now a shallow story in an action film is not in and of itself a bad thing. SWAT had tremendous potential. Jackson is commanding and eminently watchable, Farrell has enough charisma that you could watch him talk on the phone for an hour and a half (wait-I have watched him on the phone for an hour and a half)...The rest of the cast is pretty good for mostly flat characters in a typical action movie.
What goes wrong here is very screwy direction, a painfully long and dull ""training"" session, and an idiotic fist fight in the dark which you cant see and don't care about, and already know the outcome. Farrell's ""badboy"" character is never developed and never does anything bad, his ex(?) girlfriend is introduced and one of many subplots is left dangling (not that you care). This is a messed up movie...for a B-action flick, and to watch Farrell charm the world, and Jackson as a cardboard hero-it is fun-but both actors deserve so much more then they have been given here or in other movies they have done of late.",1062374400,2,1115,4.58
1205215,2,B00000F3GI,"Oh boy! Another big-budget TV adapation. This time, we get Hollywood's ""bad boy of the minute"" Colin Farrell and acting workaholic Sam Jackson as members of an elite S.W.A.T. team who must escort Euro-trash convict Martinez for a prison transfer. To spice things up, the bad guy has declared that he will pay one-hundred million dollars to anyone who helps free him causing the criminal element of the city to come out in full-force.
Farrell is Street, a former S.W.A.T. member who is on the Captain's ""... list"" after he and his old partner attempt a risky but successful save during a bank hostage crisis, that seems like it was directly pulled from the ""44 Minutes"" cable movie. Anyways, his old partner is out of the picture and Street is stuck at the evidence locker. Enter Hondo (Jackson). He is the type of ""old school tough"" that the department is looking for and they want him to start his own unit. Wouldn't you know, he finds something he likes about Street. With a new team consisiting of bad girl ...-kicker Michelle Rodriguez, rapper-actor LL Cool J, and Josh Charles, Hondo is ready for anything but not before the Captain puts his team to the test. For some reason, old Cappy doesn't much like Hondo or Street.
After about a half-hour or so of training montages and subplots that don't really go anywhere, the team passes the test. Lucky for them, they pass just in time to escort a notorious crime kingpin. Here is where things get sticky. We get a whole lot of car chases, explosions, and general action hijinx but it all seems to be done in a way where it seems so ""old hat"".
""S.W.A.T."" is very routine and predicatble. If that's not enough, it spends an exhausting ammount of time getting going. The movie spends over an hour and twenty minutes getting to the crisis and takes a little more than a half hour to finish it. For all the time we spend with the characters before the big showdown, we really don't learn much about them except that Street was left by his girlfriend and that Rodriguez's Chris Sanchez is a single mother who may or may not have a thing for Street. Most importantly for all the predictable plot twists, we really don't get much explanation. One of the major villian's motives aren't really detailed enough to understand why he would take such calculated risks.
S.W.A.T. is a two-hour movie that could have been told in under ninety-minutes. It works in some areas because of its likeable cast, most noteably Jackson and Rodriguez, but it should have been trimmed a bit in the middle. You pretty much know what you're getting into if you've watched the trailer. To say that this movie was a very predictable action vehicile would be an understatement but it does manage to entertain thanks to an energetic cast.",1062201600,,2756,4.649590163934426
1205216,2,B00000F3GI,"It seems as though if I enjoyed any movie to come out in the past few years, I better be a fan of Colin Farrell.  Has anyone else noticed that he can't say no to a movie, even if it is a mindless action movie with little to offer in terms of plot.  SWAT is just an excuse to blow things up and shoot everybody.

This movie is more predictable than 80's horror movies, but despite these major problems, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell manage to do a good job as members of SWAT.  I only hope Samuel L. Jackson begins to realize that the mindless action movies he is in are awful.  At least Vin Diesel didn't grace this movie with his presence.",1062115200,,646,4.136
1205217,4,B00000F3GI,"Being an avid player of games like Rainbow Six and Splinter Cell, I was pretty excited to see what S.W.A.T. and other counter-terrorism missions were like when real people did them. And, altough this was only a movie, I found it very entertaining.
Right off the bat, I noticed that most of the actor/actresses played very stereotypical roles. Samuel L. Jackson is your grizzled old veteran, Colin Farrell is the new guy, LL Cool J is the comic relief, and Michelle Rodriguez is the tough tomboy chick who always gets shot or bitten by a zombie in the end. Whoever that guy was that played the evil ""100 MILLION DOLLARS!"" guy probably will land a lot more roles like that as well.
Another thing I noticed was the amount of Dr. Pepper cans. Just look for them. They're everywhere. In a row of dull, white bottles, a Red Fusion bottle is sitting at the end of the row. My friend counted 30 or so during the whole thing.
All of that aside, one can find plenty of enjoyment in S.W.A.T. And maybe do yourself a favor and pick up Rogue Spear afterwards.",1061769600,,1046,4.453125
1205218,3,B00000F3GI,"I spent my hard earned cash for a matinee fully expecting to watch a big, loud, dumb, mindless and escapist action packed film filled with gun-fights, fist fights, stuff blowing up, mean Euro-trash villains (in this case a real slimy Gaul), a team made of devoted experts, decent enough acting and a few funny lines as well as a passable performance by the young Mel Gibson-like Colin Farrell and I have to say, my money was well spent.
SWAT has the potential to be the TOP GUN for special police forces. SWAT contains TOP GUN'S romanticized vision of ripped warrior bodies performing great feats of physical skill. Like TOP GUN'S Navy Pilots and their super sonic jets, this super Police force expertly manipulates specific technology to defeat the forces of evil. A warrior's complete and total command over the tools of the trade- guns, cars, clubs and each other makes such films work as effective recruitment tools. Who wouldn't want to be part of such an expert team?
SWAT embraces all the required clichs befitting a proper action/cop picture: the [...]by-the-numbers captain, the hardened veteran (played with the usual strength and charisma by the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson), the roguish rebel, the tough female partner, the shapeshifting turncoat and the family man as sacrificial lamb.
If someone wants a decent action-adventure, no thinking required, entertaining junk food movie that provides temporary satisfaction, SWAT serves the bill.",1061683200,49,1460,5.1645569620253164

1205221,4,B00000F3GI,"Based on the 1970s TV series, S.W.A.T. is a great story with just enough action to keep you going, without overdoing it.
Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) are partners on the Los Angeles Special Weapons and Tactics team. When a successful hostage rescue results in a lawsuit for the department, hot-head Gamble quits the force while Street accepts a demotion, hoping for a 2nd chance. That 2nd chance comes in the form of Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), a departmental war horse assigned to restore the division's reputation. He hand-picks a new team with Street as its top dog. The other members include Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez of Blue Crush and The Fast and the Furious); David ""Deek"" Kay (Rapper L.L. Cool J); T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles of Dead Poet's Society); and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt of Basic and Windtalkers). Throughout their training period, we get to know a bit about each team member. Their individual personalities really come to life.
Meanwhile, a French criminal kingpin named Alex Montel, played by Oliver Martinez (""Unfaithful""), is caught and imprisoned, and offers $100 million to anyone who can help him escape. The Team is now up against a bunch of money-hungry LA mercenaries which will include some familiar faces.
Great action movie. Naturally, most scenes are stolen by the legendary Samuel L. Jackson and the young, hot, Irish actor Colin Farrell. But the other team members shine as well and add so much to the team and the film. Definitely worth it.",1061164800,24,1535,4.976653696498055
1205273,3,B00000F3GI,"Remember the days when action movies were described as ""Die Hard on a ______""? Remember how any movie that was described like that never seemed to live up to the name Die Hard? S.W.A.T. is kinda like that.
It's not good, nor is it bad. It just kind of...is. In actuality, some parts of the film are really quite good and just scream with potential to be a part of a better movie. The real failure of this movie is the action. Again, not that the action is bad, it just isn't good. Even the climactic set piece where the characters take down the main villian never rises above even the least impressive action scenes from Die Hard. In the end, what you feel like is you just watched a pretty good TV episode.
The saving grace of this film is the characters. Samuel L. Jackson, L.L. Cool Jay, Michelle Rodriquez, and even Colin Farrel bring enough charisma and chemistry to the characters to keep you interested. In fact, their likable enough that you'd probably be interested in seeing a sequel regardless of what you thought of this one.
But in the end, S.W.A.T. is just an average action movie that doesn't do anything really wrong but neither does it ever rise up to do anything really impressive. Catch it on video.",1061078400,,1218,4.490990990990991

1205275,4,B00000F3GI,"I have to admit I'm not old enough to have indulged in the TV show version of this movie, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. However, I think the movie did very well.  Afterall, they pretty much already had a working script, since they didn't have to think of anything original.  And director Clark Johnson seemed to have more fun with the action, than with anything else.
The main set up is that Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is a hot shot, tough guy hottie (like he is in pretty much all of his movies.)  He's  a S.W.A.T member and ends up getting reamed, along with his partner when his partner (Jeremy Renner) shoots a hostage as part of a stand off when he was told to wait. They get the bad guy, but wounded hostage doesn't sit well with his captain.
His partner ops to leave when they are taken off S.W.A.T.  Basically, he's upset that Jim won't stand with him in giving the finger to the higher ups. He thinks Jim is sucking up and selling out.
After an argument, and a violent reaction by Jim's friend, in the locker room, Jim stays and does his time in the gun cage where he's demoted and Jeremy leaves.
Cut to 6 months later and Jim is still tooling away in the gun cage until Sam Jackson swaggers  in with his coolness and cockness, and grudge against the captain, and puts together a very impressive team of S.W.A.T member, Jim being one of them.
The comraderie between the members is fun and funny to watch. Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) is the only female, but her hard eye, growling snarl and tough stare makes her believable in playing with the guys and guns.  The  PG-13 romance that begins to bloom between Colin and Michelle is sweet, mainly because Colin has just the right blend of  charm, over-confidence and sexiness to make it work.  He's very comfortable with the ladies.
Our villian is Alex (Olivier Martinez), the French hottie from Unfaithful,  and, as an arrested drug overlord, he has the city in a frenzy when he puts out the call that anyone bad enough to break him out will pocket  100 million dollars. He has gang members all over trying their hand and failing, but the S.W.A. T members try to stay a step ahead of the nutcases.
Okay, the plot is reaching, but there are several great action sequences that help the movie move along. There isn't much lagging in between scenes because the dialogue is funny, catchy, and the chemistry between the team members is so good.  They all quickly become an extended family, look out for each other and end up being a force against the Police Captain who  has a hard-on for them to fail.
Samuel and Colin play great off each other other, and L.L. Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez are added bonuses.  If you're looking for flaws, you may find them, but over all, the action is fantastic, dialogue is funny; silly at times and Colin is eye candy.
I was actually surprised to see it rated PG-13, so you sure won't see any sex or cursing. Actually,  there wasn't even any kissing.  Mild flirting it is.
Still, this works if you like action and fun, and it was just long enough.",1060905600,,3057,4.449820788530466
1205276,4,B00000F3GI,"Let me first say that this is the first movie since--was it ""Unfaithful""?--to get me out of the house and into an actual movie theater. That says a lot right there. Now let me say that my wife is a cop and so are some of my friends. I'm ex-military and I have some weapons training, so I went into this movie expecting to be underwhelmed (and not a little upset) by the weapons handling. But I have to say, I was most impressed. Safe handling abounded, and the only careless act I saw was LL Cool J with his finger casually on the trigger of his shotgun at the wrong time. That's pretty impressive, and it's likely because real LAPD vets like Steve Gomez (the guy in shorts at the North Hollywood gig) and Scott Reitz (trainer extraordinaire) did the training. So on top of everything else, ""S.W.A.T."" has that going for it.
As far as the movie itself goes, it's serviceable--and amazingly restrained. I can imagine what kind of explosion-fest it would have been had Rob Cohen or Michael Bay directed it, and I'm glad they didn't. The plot is nothing new, but it's fairly solid. The story centers more around the team and its training, and less on the ""get the bad guy"" aspect, which was fine with me. Refreshing, even. I was a huge fan of the TV series back in the day, but I didn't expect any more connection to the series than the concept and the names. So of course the cameos by Steve Forrest and Rod Perry were a nice surprise.
The cast is good, good-looking, and comfortable in their roles. There's plenty here for everyone: action for the guys; hot guys for the girls. I thought I'd be tired of Colin Farrell by now, but surprisingly I'm not. His banter with Samuel L. Jackson was natural and convincing. And who can get enough of Michelle Rodgiguez kicking butt as usual? ""S.W.A.T."" is the popcorn movie of the summer...fall...and beyond.

SWAT makes the major mistake of taking itself too seriously and therefore is mostly silly and often a bore which is pretty amazing what with the charismatic and talented cast: the ubiquitous Colin Farrell, the stalwart Samuel L. Jackson, the nifty Michelle Rodriquez, the up and coming sex symbol Brian Van Holt, macho LL Cool J and the French heartthrob Olivier Martinez.
The most interesting part of SWAT doesn't come until the last 45 minutes and involves the capture and attempted escape of an ""International Criminal,"" Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez). Before that it's 1970's cop series malarkey with dreadful dialogue and inert action.

1205280,4,B00000F3GI,"S.W.A.T. may be the best action film since THE TRANSPORTER...Just ignore the plot holes, leaps of logic, and occasional cold-bloodedness, and enjoy the fast-paced action and macho camaraderie!
Jim Street (Colin Farrell, easily 2003's busiest actor!) is a decorated LAPD S.W.A.T. member, but when his partner, Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner, looking like a pumped-up Elijah Wood) disregards orders during a bank robbery, and wounds a 'civilian' female, while taking out the leader, the lady sues the city (considering the baddie was about to kill her, the reaction seems a bit illogical!). Dressed down by their boss, Capt. Fuller, Gamble goes ballistic, and quits the force; Street ""eats crow"", and is demoted to working in the Weapons Cage, cleaning weapons and putting up with verbal abuse from former teammates (who thought he'd 'sold' his partner out...an attitude that seems illogical, as well, as he'd been in their ranks three years, and they SHOULD have known him better! ). He maintains an insane physical regimen, and prays for the day he can return to S.W.A.T.
Six months pass, and the unit's reputation is on the skids, so veteran warhorse 'Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson, looking sexier and more dangerous than ever!) is called in, to put together an elite team inside of S.W.A.T., sort of a 'baddest of the bad' crew, to take on worst case scenarios (how this would help the performance of the REST of the unit, who knows?) He picks Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt from S.W.A.T., LL Cool J, a street cop with an 'attitude', Michelle Rodriguez, as a female cop with even MORE of an attitude...and Jim Street, with whom he bonds like a long-lost brother, despite threats from Capt. Fuller. There is GREAT chemistry between Jackson and Farrell, and their scenes together are film highlights!
After 'DIRTY DOZEN'-like training scenes, and embarrassing the egotistical Fuller by ace-ing his terrorist hijacking training scenario (""Best time ever, right?"" Hondo razzes the Captain, as the last 'terrorist' is taken down), the new unit is given a choice assignment...moving a youthful international crime kingpin (played by UNFAITHFUL's Olivier Martinez) to a holding facility. Unfortunately, in front of television cameras, Martinez offers $100 million dollars to anyone who can spring him...and virtually EVERY hood in L.A. decides to take a shot at the money. Then the fun REALLY begins, as the film becomes one long action sequence!
While the subsequent 'surprises' are predictable, and the climax, a Lear Jet landing on a bridge, is impossible (the winds alone would have cracked up the small aircraft against the narrow confines of the span),  the pacing is so fast and furious that you accept the leap of  logic of the sequence, and the subsequent fight between Street and...well, watch the movie!
While I'm not sure S.W.A.T. will encourage tourism to L.A. (which is pictured as so crime-ridden that it makes New York City look like an Amish village!), the film IS fun, in a violent sort of way, and seeing the star of the original series, Steve Forrest, in a brief cameo, was a pleasure!
