8336785,4,B001QX010O,"Released on Mr Bongo in 2005 ""Terra em Transe"" is dated, and has a confused screenplay, although being magnificently updated regarding the lack of ethics and the amoral behavior of the politicians. If the reader has had the opportunity of reading Machiavelli's ""The Prince"", you'll probably see how the behavior of politicians remains unchanged along the centuries.

However, keeping in mind that in this is movie Brazil was under a tough military dictatorship, this movie is a milestone in the history of Brazilian New Cinema. Glauber Rocha was very braze, discussing forbidden themes such as fight of classes, manipulation of the submissive masses by the elites, corruption in politician, anarchism, campaign promises not kept after the elections, economical power of foreign groups (or countries) in Latin American countries and coup d'tat. In 1967, ""Terra em Transe"" was awarded with ""Great Prize"" in the Locarno Festival (Switzerland); ""Luis Buuel Prize"" in Cannes Festival; ""Federation of International Critics Prize"" in Cannes Festival; and Best Movie of the Year in the Air France Prize, among other prizes",1257984000,3,1114,5.402298850574713
