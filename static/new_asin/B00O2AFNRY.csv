8681580,5,B00O2AFNRY,Beautiful video of Rhineland Germany!  I love these cycling dvds and have many of the titles in my collection.  Rhineland Germany was as good as it gets. I cycled along the Moselle River which was very pretty with the famous half-timbered houses I associate with Germany. The Black Forest and countryside is vast with castles popping up every so often which remind you that you're in Europe. I recommend this trip to those who want to feel like they are actually cycling through Germany.  Keep them coming!,1455840000,4,506,4.793103448275862
8681581,1,B00O2AFNRY,Horrible. This does not play in a DVD machine. A product shouldn't be sold if is not functional. Zero stars,1425513600,,107,4.4
