2073800,5,B0002B54JY,"Granted my family are die-hard Wiggly fans but we loved this video!!!!!  One of the most fun and catchy the Wiggles have put out yet!  This one is in the style of Top of the Tots so don't expect the old style.  Nice mix of traditional and new songs and definitly leaves you with a warm, wiggly, Christmas feeling!  Definity worth the money if your kids love the Wiggles!",1097884800,10,370,4.318840579710145
2073801,2,B0002B54JY,"My biggest complaint and the main reason I'm giving this disc a 2 star is the misleading running time printed on the back of the video and the insulting ""bonus"" features. I bought my video through a major retailer rather than than on-line from Amazon.com. I quickly glanced at the back of the video and noticed a running time of 85 minutes. Along with that were two ""bonus"" episodes of the Wiggles Tv series and a couple other extras. I actually thought the Wiggles packed enough content into one video to justify spending $16 on it. Boy, was I mislead! The 85 minutes running time is for the ENTIRE DISC! This is the first time I've seen a video include Trailers (featureing Barney and Tipper), Picture Galleries, and ""bonus"" episodes as part of the running time. In fact, the true running time of the video is less than 40 minutes. Perhaps even more mind boggling is the fact that the two ""bonus"" episodes aren't even full episodes... they're just 10 minute ""clips"" from two of their TV shows (which are terrible in their own right). It's amazing to me that these low budget, poorly thought-out videos don't sell for less than $10. A phone call to HIT Entertainment did little good. Apparantly HIT has no direction with the video contents. Their just a publisher. So, the blame is soley on the Wiggles and their producers who are trying to profit as much as possible before the Wiggles fall out of style.

On a positive note, some of the songs are catchy and the set is bright and colorful. For the most part, my sons enjoyed the video... which almost was enough for me to give this video a 3.. almost. I just can't forgive the low production values, extremely poor extras, and misleading running time.",1097798400,7,1704,4.586885245901639

2073840,2,B0002B54JY,I guess I was hoping for a better performance because my life skills student enjoy watching wiggles during their choice time but this one did not keep their interest. Select another cd if you want more lively song and dance.,1386979200,,224,4.625

did have yet.  They love them...",1357344000,,147,6.0
2073857,4,B0002B54JY,"My 3 year old Wiggles fan borrowed this dvd from my sister last month and absolutely loved it so I decided to buy it for him for Christmas.

As far as the actual show goes it is a wonderful collection of Christmas songs with the unique Wiggles touch.

My favorite thing about this dvd is that is has Christmas songs about Jesus! Most secular Christmas shows won't include anything about Jesus; however, this one has several classic carols such as ""O come all ye faithful,"" ""Away in a manger,"" and ""Silent night"" which is wonderful given it is one of my son's favorite shows.

The only con to this particular dvd (not the show itself) is that the voices are off from the lip sync by a couple of seconds which can make it challenging to watch for an adult but that hasn't stopped my son from wiggling and dancing to it :)

All in all it is a great dvd which my son will most likely be watching for a long time (he's watching it as I write this review!)",1356652800,,950,4.232044198895028
2073858,5,B0002B54JY,Any child under the age of 10 will enjoy the Wiggles Christmas DVD.  My grandchildren love it and we play it at least 5 times a year. (we had a tape previous to this purchase).,1298937600,,176,4.0285714285714285
2073859,5,B0002B54JY,"We've had this video for a few years now, and we watch it every year, over and over again.  I never get tired of it!  In fact, I find myself sitting down (with the kids or without them!) to watch my favorite songs.  The last two songs are two of my very favorite.  The guy who plays Santa has some great moves, and is so fun to watch.  I love the energy and fun of the whole video.  The guy from the Brady Bunch shows up in one of the songs, and he cracks me up.
In addition to the fun songs, there are some really tender, meaningful songs on here too.
Overall, such a great video!  We love the Wiggles in general, but this is one of their best!",1294185600,,645,3.9153846153846152
2073860,5,B0002B54JY,Definitely a Favorite of the Wiggles videos. My daughter loves this DVD. Lots of dancing and catchy tunes. Would recommend.,1294099200,,123,5.2
2073861,5,B0002B54JY,"I love this video.  The songs are great, and I love that there are religious songs and images that celebrate the true meaning of Christmas, Jesus' birth.  It is a welcome change from most politically correct kids ""Christmas"" videos that shy away from nativity scenes, and celebrate the coming of winter instead.",1293321600,,311,4.961538461538462
2073882,5,B0002B54JY,"All of the Wiggles are good singers, but Barry Williams is the one with the sexy voice.

Very upbeat, entertaining video - my daughter loves it and everyone in the family can't help humming the tunes.  All of the guest stars add to the show and make it a winner.  Also, it's refreshing that they're able to focus on Christmas - thanks, Wiggles!",1287964800,,344,4.428571428571429
2073883,5,B0002B54JY,We love this video. It not only has Santa but has some nice Christian Christmas songs too which we really appreciate.,1261180800,,117,4.619047619047619
2073884,5,B0002B54JY,"We've had this DVD for several years, as part of a Wiggles box set.  The other 2 have always been in heavy rotation around here at the holidays, but somehow we missed out on this one.  Well, somehow it tumbled into the DVD player this year and my 5 year old daughter LOVES it.  She loves the more religious nature of the songs, since this is probably the first year she's had a strong understanding of the story of Jesus' birth.  And to my endless amusement, she has declared herself a huge John Fogerty fan and wants more, more, more.

Thanks, Wiggles, for 4 years and counting...",1229904000,,581,4.392523364485982
2073885,5,B0002B54JY,This is definitely the best Wiggles Christmas DVD (I have the whole lot). My children just love it - my six-month old son is entranced by it and my daughter sings and dances through it. Great job Wiggles!,1229817600,,204,4.394736842105263
2073886,5,B0002B54JY,I couldn't believe the prompt service I got on these tapes I order.  My granddaughter loves the Wiggles and I can get a really good selection on Amazon.com.

2073888,3,B0002B54JY,"Surprisingly my daughter didn't go ga-ga over this. She loves all things Wiggles and Santa, but this could not hold her attention. It is a lot like Wiggly Wiggly World, a lot of effects. They also use the same format of introducing the songs and their special guests/ singers. It was a bit too flashy for me. I recommend Wiggly Wiggly Christmas over this DVD.",1199232000,,359,4.538461538461538
2073889,5,B0002B54JY,"My 2 and 4 year old sons LOVE THIS.
Weeks until Christmas and they run around singing the songs all of the time.

This Christmas DVD is beautiful. We love the songs and above all it teaches our child about our faith. Also, you get to see the Wiggles family and children.",1183939200,,272,4.150943396226415
2073891,5,B0002B54JY,This video is a lot of wiggles fun.  It is nice to hear traditional Christmas songs along with new Christmas songs!  I love that it doesn't shy away from songs about the nativity!  It is my favorite of their Christmas videos.  The Wiggles songs and music are contagious and as a parent you know you will get the songs stuck in your head too.  My boys love The Wiggles.  Also some great singers join the Wiggles for a few of the songs.,1173744000,2,434,4.2317073170731705
2073902,3,B0002B54JY,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She lost interest after awhile. I think it was a lot of songs and not enough talking skits to make it interesting enough for a 2 year old. She didn't recognize all the music and I think wanted to see more talking.,1168732800,,255,4.019607843137255

2073904,5,B0002B54JY,I found this DVD to be the best one out of the 3 Christmas DVD's that the Wiggles have put out. My 3 year old loves it and we have watched it many times. I'm sure we will watch it many times more.,1167782400,,196,3.5813953488372094
2073905,5,B0002B54JY,Both of my kids ages 6 and 4 love this Dvd. It's fun to watch them sing and dance to it.,1150243200,,88,3.238095238095238
2073906,5,B0002B54JY,My little boy loves this video and so do I. It is very entertaining and teaches what the true meaning of Christmas is! I think it is wonderful!!!!,1134691200,2,146,4.25
2073907,2,B0002B54JY,"My sons (21 months old, and 10 months old) loved this video, and I thought it was very cute. The only problem is that by JUST making it a Christmas special, they exclude thier young fans of other faiths. I am Pagan, my husband is Christian and we celebrate Christmas AND Yule at our house. An oxymoron you might think, but not when we hold the beleif that that there are many roads (faiths) to one destination (nirvana, Heavan,Summerland, Asgard, Paradise...ect) My children are to young to know what the meanings of Different holidays are, but I will strive to teach them about the many faiths,celebrations and customs around the world.  Now...don't get me wrong, I am in no way offended by Christmas, but I just feel bad for the kids of other faiths wondering why they are just singing about baby Jesus, and not other Holiday things celebrated at this time of year. Many people are getting fed up with others taking offense to Christmas, and the politically correct ""Generic"" holiday celebrations, but I don't think the Holidays tshould be Generic by any means, just more inclusive. It would have been nice to see songs or information about Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanza, Yule, and other holidays celebrated around the world at this time.

So.... I gave it 2 stars because the Wiggles should realize that they have more than JUST Christian fans out there.

Happy Holidays Everyone!!!

2073908,4,B0002B54JY,"My son loves this DVD.  He recieved it last year for Christmas, but we are subjected to watch it all year long.  Personally, it is not MY favorite Wiggles DVD, but my son enjoys it so much. He especially loves the first song they perform and sings and dances along with it.  It is a great Christmas DVD, but hide it for the rest of the year or you will have to sing ""Silent Night"" with your child in August, and that feels pretty weird.",1130889600,3,436,4.105882352941176
2073909,2,B0002B54JY,"Your toddler may just love this but I find it excreciatingly painful to watch over and over and over again.  Skip this and go for another Wiggles video.  Very low budget and tacky.  ""Wags Stop Your Barking"" is catchy but I can do without the rest.  Instead, may I recommend Yummy Yummy or Wiggles Magical Adventure.",1108944000,,315,4.571428571428571
2073910,5,B0002B54JY,"This is a very nice Christmas DVD.  It combines light hearted songs with religious ones in a most wonderful way.  We also get to see the Wiggle's families as well as the production staff's families.  Our daughter simply adores it so much we bought the CD for the car!  OK the costume that Barry Williams wears is totally off the wall for my taste.  However my daughter likes it and who better than Greg Brady to wear such a rig???? It fits his old TV character to a T!  He is a good sport for wearing it.  The songs are mostly soft rock when they are rock, but most kids aren't into the harder stuff anyway.  The wiggles once again proved that quality music for children is totally possible and attainable!",1108512000,7,706,4.33587786259542
2073911,5,B0002B54JY,"When I first saw (Santa's Rockin), it was one of the wiggly features that got me engrossed.  The electronic storybook called Dorothy's Spots and two episodes of Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles!  It was so cute when The Wiggles called Santa Great Big Man in Red, and how fantastic Anthony looked in his elf costume within the song, ""Wags, Stop Your Barking, It's Almost Christmas Day"".  That's one my favorite new songs-so is ""Captain Feathersword's Christmas Dance.",1106006400,2,465,5.092105263157895
2073922,5,B0002B54JY,"I recieved this DVD as soon as it hit the stores, before Thanksgiving, and watched it every night up until Christmas! Now that Christmas is over, I don't even know if it will stay on the shelf until next year! Why should this DVD not be enjoyed all throughout the year? ""This little baby is born again"" is my absolute favourite on this DVD, so beautiful!!! What I love most is that they don't care about sticking to the exact script, they all add in their own antics to make it interesting and more fun!! The wiggly dancers are an awesome addition to the DVD and give them a bit of a different sound, which is nice and refreshing! Kudos to the choreographer for the wonderful dances!!

A must have in your wiggly collection!!",1104710400,,725,4.41044776119403
2073923,5,B0002B54JY,I like this DVD because it has both traditional Christmas music and Wiggles tunes.  This keeps my 14 month old daughter's attention while I'm baking my holiday treats!  Great holiday DVD to add to your collection!,1104105600,,213,4.888888888888889
2073924,4,B0002B54JY,"This is one of the many Wiggles videos that we own, and it's become a favorite in our house.  The songs are much more advanced, with many levels of vocals and instruments.  The addition of the Wiggly dancers (also in other more recent videos) just adds another dimension.

In response to those who say it's corny, or too goofy my response would be this.  It's not for adults, it's for kids!!!!! That's their goal, to entertain children!!!!  My three year old daughter loves the Wiggles, and it's not unusual for her to memorize the songs and dances, and participate along with the video.  And if she's happy, I'm happy.

I do question why Barry Williams is in this video, but for the most part, my daughter doesn't even acknowledge his presence.  Her only complaint (and it's a mild one) is that Dorothy, Wags and Henry aren't in it as much.  But she still loves it!",1104105600,,866,4.535483870967742
2073925,1,B0002B54JY,"I know the Wiggles can be corny but this video is over the top - from their flamboyant sets (which I guess is meant to be a distraction from their less than imaginative routines) to Anthony's ridiculous behavior. I like most of their earlier stuff where they actually spent time on choreography and actual entertainment. In this video and in most of their later stuff, including their latest series Network Wiggles, they spend most of their time just being silly. They don't even try anymore. No more fun dances like ""Blow me Down"" or any of the dances from Yummy, Yummy. My son loves to dance with them. I like watching their routines. But this video has none of that unless you count the ridiculous Reindeer Dance that took no thought at all. And there is even an appearance by Johnny Bravo himself, Greg Brady. Weird! They are getting cornier in their old age. And it would be really nice if Anthony took things a little more seriously. He constantly misses cues and is off goofing off. It's kind of funny but he looks like a dope. I just found this one too annoying and hid it away. Wiggly, Wiggly Time, Yummy Yummy, and Hoop Dee Doo are MUCH better.",1104105600,,1154,4.5
2073926,5,B0002B54JY,"My jaw almost hit the floor when I saw ""Santa's Rockin'"" playing on the Disney Channel.  A kids holiday special that actually acknowledges the ""Christ"" in Christmas!?!  Isn't that supposed to be illegal in the U.S.?  Somebody call the FCC!

As G.K. Chesterton wrote, ""These are the days when the Christian is expected to praise every creed except his own.""  His words are even more true in our day than they were in his, and it takes an Australian foursome like the Wiggles to break through the new American taboo.  Bravo to the Wiggles for a job well done in balancing the religious and secular aspects of Christmas--all while making a program so entertaining that my 1, 3, & 9 year old kids can't take their eyes off it!",1103155200,11,722,4.558139534883721
2073927,2,B0002B54JY,"We have many of the Wiggles DVD's and videos and were really disapointed with this DVD. There is the usual Wiggle stuff and child directed humor, but we were suprised at the amount of religious content towards the Virgin Mary. Too much for comfort.

We understand that this is a religious time, but spend more time on Santa rather than poor quality pictures and video of the Virgin Mary that deserve a more appropriate forum.

Don't get me wrong, we go to church regularly, this just seemed too much.

Sorry Wiggles but this was a FLOP!",1103068800,,536,4.5625

I am going to buy it for my friend's one-year-old twin girls too.  If your child loves the Wiggles, they will absolutely love this one too.  Great religious Christmas songs as well as multicultural Christmas songs.  I especially like ""This Little Baby Is Born Again"".",1102291200,4,391,4.6911764705882355
2073929,4,B0002B54JY,"This was a cute video and my daughter (2 1/2) is a major fan.  She didn't care too much for the Spanish singing.  Also on the DVD she noticed the words are not in sync with the lips as they talk and questioned why Greg was talking and it was supposed to be Dorothy.  Our neighbor bought the DVD also and it's the same on hers.  It's very noticeable in spots.  Other than that, it's a good video.",1101686400,,395,4.012820512820513
2073930,5,B0002B54JY,"When I first watched ""The Wiggles"" on TV, I almost couldn't stand how corny the show was.  But, my 2-year-old was glued to the set.  So why deny her because I find it silly!  After watching pieces of the show here and there, and hearing some of the songs, I decided they really weren't that bad.  I bought this video on a whim.  Got it home, played it and all of the adults in the room sighed.  It wasn't the same as the TV show.  But, again, my 2-year-old was glued to the screen!  She loved it!  Even my soon-to-be 1-year-old did some (seriously funny) knee-bending dancing!  (He's just getting the hang of walking, let alone dancing!  Too funny!)  Every day so far it's been played.  Sometimes more than once.  And you know what?  I LIKE SOME OF THE SONGS NOW! As soon as the tape goes in, my 2-year-old gets ready to ""dance.""  The baby gets as close to the TV as possible and does his little knee-bending dancing--and I think that's awesome!  We're clapping, singing, and learning the reindeer dance moves!  Corny?  Heck yes!  Fun?  Absolutely!  Just remember it's for them: the babies and toddlers and pre-schoolers.  Maybe even older ones!  If they're having fun and singing along and trying to do the dance steps, then what harm could come of that?  (I'm still trying to figure out how someone called ANY part of this video ""scary.""  It's not like they were giving birth or anything.  If showing mothers and fathers with their babies scares yours, then you might want to bring this up at your next visit with the pediatrician! For real. I'd be worried!)",1101600000,,1560,4.517985611510792
