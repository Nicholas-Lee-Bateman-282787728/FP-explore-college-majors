convert it to a disc on the computer, but so far no success..  Looks like I have invested for nothing.
What I have been able to see on it via the computer is nothing like the folklore show that we saw in St Petersburg recently. (15th August, 2013 by a company with a name sounding like ""Roar""
Our show was not at any castle, but at a very good Concert Hall.  Videos of the show were on sale but only in exchange for
American dollars or Euros.  I had neither - so missed out.  A great pity as it was one of the best shows of this type that I
have ever seen.  Plenty of action and of course the cossack dancing as well. Brought a standing ovation from everyone.
At this stage I cannot commit to any more than one star for this VCR, as I may never get to see it all anyway.
The show I saw was booked through the Russian Company ""OLGA"" and the performance was on 15th August, 2013.
Any suggestions you may have for me to secure a video of this show would be welcome. I ordered the one you sent because I thought it might be similar, but no such luck.  Nevermind, maybe one day

Imagine our delight to find this VHS tape on Amazon.com.  It came in record time and featured exactly the same people that we had seen perform when we were there.  So we have enjoyed it greatly.  If you'd like to see an authentic Russian folk show in the comfort of your own home, this is for you.",1326585600,,474,3.9473684210526314
