7862183,5,6304107188,"Pinky & the Brain have to be one of the greatest cartoons ever made.  It easily appeals to kids and adults alike.  This video is a great start for any collection for fans of the cartoon or just cartoons in general.  It contains three short episode; Pavlov's Mice, Brain Meets Brawn, Where Rodents Dare, and Tokyo Grows.  All great episodes in the tradition of what this cartoon is like.  I beleive they are from the early beginings of the show when it was a part of Animaniacs on the WB.  Although it is a bit short, 37 minutes total, this video is a must buy, a great addition to your collection that will appeal to the entire family.  Buy it now before you no longer can!",970272000,40,673,4.2936507936507935
