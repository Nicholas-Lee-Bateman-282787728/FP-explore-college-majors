1134796,3,7884891093,"i already bought a doreamon dvd set before however the long adventure of doreamon from my old dvd set doesnt have english subtitle thats y i tried to look for another one with english subtitle. I went to amazon and i found this dvd set, i was very happy it had 8 discs instead of 4 discs that i have for my old dvd set so i decided to buy it. I waited and waited and waited finally after about 10 days i got my new dvd set. I was still very excited until i play the first disc, it doesnt have much episodes (only about 9) and i could quickly finish the first one. Unlike the dvd set that i had before it took me like many days to finish one disc lol. And theres no long adventure at all :-s totally disappointed :@",1281484800,5,714,3.9310344827586206
1134797,2,7884891093,"Made in China with pretty poor sound quality on the Japanese. The English subtitles are obviously done by Chinese manufacturer who sought no help from a native speaker (good for comedy value, but not so great if you actually want to watch the series). But hey, it is a good lot of Doraemon cartoons.",1231632000,10,299,4.555555555555555
1134798,5,7884891093,"I'm very happy with this Doraemon DVD. The DVD case was cracked just as the seller has honestly stated in their ad, and so I was not surprised when I recieved the packet. Regardless, I enjoyed watching the cartoons very much :)",1229385600,2,227,4.428571428571429

7900360,1,7884891093,Listed as Region 0 -- arrived as Region 9. Supposed to have English subtitles. Only Chinese subtitles.,1520208000,,102,5.0588235294117645
7900361,1,7884891093,Item used to say subtitled in English but after i ordered it they took that part off. No subtitles on these dvds at all.  Very sad,1482883200,,130,4.0
7900362,1,7884891093,Extremely misleading product. It is very poor quality video and sound and is in Mandarin Chinese. Subtitles are available in Japanese. I was unable to find English subtitles on any of the DVD's. They are boxed in sleeves and do not look like a professional release at all. I would highly discourage anyone from buying this unless you're okay with what looks like pirated Chinese Doraemon. I returned mine to Amazon for a full refund.,1453507200,6,433,4.786666666666667

7900365,3,7884891093,"These are not the official release. There are 6 DVDs. First 3 DVDs consist of a total of 75 short episodes and the other 3 DVDs contain 14 extended episodes. The 27 episodes on each DVD are grouped in three chapters, meaning that you can't jump to a specific episode you want. The picture quality is ok. Only Chinese subtitle.",1415577600,4,326,4.45
7900366,3,7884891093,"Very thorough in the amount of episodes in this package. However, please know that there are duplicates in episodes. So, buy at your own risk. Also, some of the subtitles are difficult to follow. Other than that, it's a must for Doraemon fans.",1353369600,,243,4.674418604651163
7900367,3,7884891093,"I've loved Doraemon comics since I was a kid in Taiwan. I was thrilled to find the cartoons on DVD. There are 9 episodes per DVD and 8 DVDs in this set, for a total of 72 episodes. Each episode is about 7 minutes. The episodes are very true to the original comics-- they basically animated the comic books. I have several of the comic books (traditional Chinese translation from Taiwan) which were turned into cartoon episodes, and the dialog, drawings, plot are exactly the same. The Mandarin soundtrack is very well done, and some of the Chinese subtitles are good. Sometimes the Chinese subtitles are inaccurate.  Sound and image quality are decent. However, the English subtitles are outrageously bad-- full of nonsensical phrases, awful grammar, spelling and vocabulary errors. These English subtitles were poor translations of badly translated Chinese. Fortunately the kids and I understand Mandarin, but we can't enjoy Doraemon with our non-Chinese-speaking friends due to the terrible English subtitles.

I can't comment on the Japanese since I don't know any Japanese.

Since Doraemon is called ""xiao ding dang"" in this series, I will guess that these are old cartoons dubbed into Mandarin for the Taiwanese audience from the 1980s.

I'm very happy to have these DVDs but disappointed by the poor English subtitles.",1324080000,24,1324,5.1157407407407405
