2581947,1,B000FQJA2S,I have been waiting for Criterion to release this for 4 years now. With the technology of restoration of older films vastly improving I must say this is the worst transfer that I have seen of an older film released in the last two years. Don't spend your money on this edition and hope that Criterion will release this in our lifetime!,1152144000,150,335,4.419354838709677
2581948,5,B000FQJA2S,"This long awaited release is by far the best version of this film yet released, far exceeding Criterion's previous Laser disc release.  This is by far the most accurate and complete version of this film classic, presented in its original form in German (with English subtitles) and English dialogue and loaded with bonus extras, some not previously seen before such as the ""Olympic Oath"" footage which was cut out of the original version and packed with extra footage from foreign language versions not included in the German or English releases.  This is the definitive version of a timeless, landmark cinematic classic which has been unsurpassed in all the history of world cinema.  Hats off to Pathfinder as they have selected not only the best quality 35mm prints but also making it possible for this exceptional release to be available on easily accessable DVDs.  The best release for the year 2006!

2581949,4,B000FQJA2S,"Olympia is a piece of sport history coated in a magnificent art form. The superlatives aren't enough to describe this documentary; a veritable time machine traveling to an amazing and Orwellian future Valhalla called Nazi Germany.

1936 Olympiad was also well renown for the first to be broadcast on a form of television. This DVD sadly has an image quality comparable to what the citizens of Berlin saw on those twenty five large screens scattered along the City's main boulevards 70 years ago.  Having seen some excerpts from ""Olympia"" in the documentary `The Wonderful Horrible life of Leni Riefenstahl"" on DVD, I had great expectations concerning the image quality of this new release. What a disappointment! No one bothered to digitally remove the annoying scratches not mentioning the total absence of any timid tentative of restoration of a decent audio sound. Everything seems like a low resolution transfer from a cheap VHS . Let's hope that some day Criterion Collection will do this film the justice it deserves.",1151798400,156,1023,5.083333333333333

Leni Riefenstahl was an Artist and she suffered by being misjudged as a Nazi sympathizer.  ""Portions of Her work was copied by many documentary filmmakers right up to today.. Her photography using underwater cameras during the swimming and diving competition as well as the moving camera around the main Olympic stadium, cameras in the air, etc etc. were her own invention.  These are now copied and are commonplace in every sporting event around the world.  The International Olympic committee awarded her a special prize in 1948, this was after the war. It should be noted that the Olympic committee did not fall for the slander propaganda which was used against her. She was truly a groundbreaking film artist that deserves the recognition. As well it should be noted that the Torch relay which is now commonplace was her invention, and it was at the Berlin games where it first originated.

Watching the various events as athletes do their best to win events was interesting and fun to watch.  The changes in the way various have changed over the years over the years.  Especially the high jump.  in 1936 they just jumped over the bar like jumping over a hurdle.  Now we have the Fosbery flop. Watching Jessie Owens quickly out distance his fellow competitors was enjoyable.  One can see the genius of Leni Riefenstahl as she filmed the events.  She developed techniques she would later use in her film ""Triumph of the Will"".  The film also showed some Olympic events that we see in modern day coverage, like sailing events and fencing.  The movie is in German with English subtitles and is easy to follow because there is little dialogue.  Most of the narration is a the beginning of the events and at the end.  We get to enjoy the intense competition between the athletes as they do their best to win each event.  It is an excellent documentary of the 1936 Olympics, the last such events before World War II.

It was also nice to see the close-ups (staged later) of the rowers.  (A great read:  THE BOYS IN THE BOAT, by Dan Brown).",1393372800,,416,4.434210526315789
2582008,4,B000FQJA2S,"I have the Criterion Laser Disc set. According to Criterion, Riefenstahl herself supervised the film/disk transfer along with some curious cropping decisions. Frames are foreshortened and many a head is left off the screen. The Criterion version has better picture quality and better audio. I'm fairly certain this copy was the one broadcast  by PBS.

The Leni Riefenstahl Archival version has some additional footage and less cropping. Images are grainy and the transfer is essentially adequate. The narration is in German with some curious English subtitling. Aerial footage taken from the Hindenberg is very revealing since it shows a labor camp in a sunset shot. Charlie Chan at the Olympics shows a more generic aerial view.

Considering the film is approaching its eightieth year, it is still quite an achievement considering the equipment and technology of its time. The notorious historic players depicted give it a deep foreboding of the horrors to come in a mere three years.

A quote by Hitler: ""The games of 1940 will be held in Tokyo, thereafter, the games will be held in Berlin""

One cannot apply  'modern' film and audio standards to this film.",1391472000,8,1160,5.078947368421052
2582009,5,B000FQJA2S,"Part I
The film opens up with a film tribute to the history of Greece and the games. We get to see the names of the nations at the time that the torch passes through as it reached Berlin. A much more realistic torch than today's is ran into the stadium with a few pauses to let everyone see just before the final dash to the Olympic torch at the stadium. It would be great to recapture this in the present day. Some of the tribute leads me to believe that our athletes are overly clothed for the sports.

Part II
By now watching Part I, ""Festival of the nation"" spoiled you. Again this film starts out with the ideal and surrounded by Leni's signature clouds. List is leading you to ""field hockey, soccer bicycling, equestrian, aquatic and gymnastic events. Highlights are the Pentathlon and the Decathlon."" Remember that some countries were still using horses in the military.

It may be unique reasons that brought you to this point such as Leni or photography, or interest in history, or, or, or. But once the action starts you feel that you are there and get lost in the ""who will win what and how."" Even being aware of the outcome does not prepare you to ""not bite your nails"" as you watch each athlete barley besting the next until it is over too soon. I noticed that instead of placing medals over the winners, they used laurel wreaths.
Any way you cut it, this movie is worth watching.",1383091200,2,1393,4.416342412451362
2582010,5,B000FQJA2S,"Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" is perhaps the most important film to come from Nazi Germany; ""Olympia"" is just as powerful, but in a unique way. Interestingly, it did not appear to be a (mere) propaganda film, although certainly there was some of that. It was interesting to see which of the athletes in the opening ""parade"" offered the Nazi salute when they passed Hitler, who did not appear except briefly. The opening sequence is perhaps the best example of Leni's skill, The mechanics that captured, for example, foot races were perhaps not as elaborate as those which were used to capture scenes in ""Triumph..."" and would be considered crude by today's standards. Still, for its time, ""Olympia"" is just as important as anything from that era. Recommended for middle-to-high school students (with an intelligent lecture on the historical setting) and adults.",1378944000,3,872,5.104895104895105
2582021,5,B000FQJA2S,I have seen this film many times before and got the DVD version this time.  There are many parts which are spectacular (track and field) and others that are mundane (equestrian and boating) but the overall tenor is a surprise when one considers that Riefenstahl was supposed to glorify the Nazis. In part she ends up honoring the great Jesse Owens and his admirable accomplishments.  The innovations in cinematography are remarkable and amplify the celebration of sheer athletic beauty.,1363564800,4,486,5.139240506329114
2582022,4,B000FQJA2S,"Leni may have been an unpleasant person who deserved a lot of jail time for what she did, but she is undeniably talented with the camera. Anybody who is seriously studying cinema photography has to look at her technical work objectively and admire her innovations. It is beautifully shot. Admittedly there are lots of creepy, disturbing situations in the movie ( how would you like to march into a stadium and have 50,000 Nazis plus their Hitler stare at you) but there are also lots of inspirational moments too. Like Jesse Owens kicking Nazi butt in the Long Jump and one of the races. It's hard to be objective about a Nazi propaganda flick, but see for yourself and try.",1353196800,,674,4.625
2582023,5,B000FQJA2S,"A beautiful Film, in its phoyography way ahead of the standard of the times.
By the way, I was there in Berlin at the time. a ten-year-old, and we boys knew ""them"" all., and  everybody shared the excitement of the Games. Today, some call it a propaganda-film. I do not think it was. It refelcted exactly what was happening at the time. It is a sports film.. It is a fair presentation of what was happening at the games.
It is a beautiful film. I remember Jessi Owens and his German comptetitor Lutz Long, I remember the decathelon, and that never ending pole-vault till late into the night. I remember ""Morris USA"". The American sprinters, the relays.
We loved every minute of those two weeks. Had to read it in the paper or listen to the excitement on the radio. And have seen it on film now.
I thought the opening sequence of the girls dancing was a little stretched. which is my only negative comment to the film if that is ""negative"". It was beautiful, just a liitle too long.
I believe it was the first time, in 1936, that the torch was carried from Olympia in a relay through all the countries on its way to Berlin  A sensation throughout Europe.
I really recommend the film for viewing to everybody who is interested in sports, the Olympic Games, and those times. It is an outstanding film for its time, in every of its detail.
By the way, I saw an American version of the film which showed Adolf Hitler geting all worked up when Jessie Owens ran his 10 sec. He did not. That shot was inserted. That was the actual scene with Adolf Hitler when the German relay girls, for the first time in history ahead of the US team, lost the baton at the last exchange.
My review? My recommendation! A beautiful film indeed, but remember it was made 76 years ago.

One could write books about her genius in film production 'Olympia' is just one. Her artistic talent and inovations in the art of film production and editing (which was not easy back in 1936.) was just pure genius. But alas, the Late Leni Riefenstahl will always be remembered for her infamous film 'Triumph of the Will' a documentary on the 1934 Nazi Party Congress where the film glorified the nazi's. A documentary that she did not want to make. Her film 'Olympia'is a magnificent documentary with film innovations and skills still used today.

2582030,4,B000FQJA2S,"I purchased this version of Olympia and wanted to see many different ones because I was so inspired by the film .  I also purchased a version by Art Haus on the German Amazon site amazon.de and another one by germanwarfilms.com that claims to have directly transfered it from a 16mm film  .  I used google translate when I purchased the one on the German Amazon site and can tell you this one has the best film quality of the three. But it all rests on what you want . If you want the absolute best quality get the Art Haus one. It has 3 discs and has Leni Riefenstahls African film features she shot in Africa. It also has her in an underwater film she made .But beware it is in the PAL format and will not play on a regular DVD player from the USA. I have a Philips Model # DVP5990 DVD Player that plays PAL DVDS on all regions that I paid about $75 for. I think I bought it online and it works great putting everything in 1080p if you want to go that route . Also there are no English Subtitles . Everything is in German . It cost $48 shipping included and took a little over a week to get to Tennessee from Germany.

The one from germanwarfilms.com is my favorite. It does not have all the extra stuff but I like the way it was put together ,so simple with a good film transfer .You feel the films essence in this one. It has English Subtitles. The Art Haus film quality is a 10 and this one a 7 and the Pathfinder a 5.

I like the Pathfinder version though for the many additional film clips such as some winter olympic footage ,boxing and fencing  . It shows Hitler in the snow and has other clips that are not in any of the other ones. Has footage of thousands of athletes exercising at the same time. It has women doing exercises with what looks like bowling pins. It also has English subtitles. Best complete footage ,worst transfer . But I recommend them all . I watch all 3 from time to time to see the different features.

My Grandfather was 34 years old when this film was made and I can see the honesty and innocence of his generation. Everyone at the events wore suites and ties and the ladys wore dresses. There was no corporate sponsers advertisements in your face and no nike swimsuits. They put a wreath around their heads and the Lady athletes got a tree plant presented to them no doubt to take home and plant to grow and remember the event for years to come . All the boats were identical in the race and so was the bicycles . You had to be the better athlete to win in those days not a better boat or bicycle builder getting the advantage on lighter materials.

So nice to watch , and so nice of them to salute the beauty of the youth of our world at that time.  Enjoy !",1311206400,6,2693,4.133843212237093

On the whole, I found the photography to be outstanding and the historical footage of the games very well done.

2582044,5,B000FQJA2S,"This brilliant film should be in the curriculum of schools that teach filmmaking
and sports history.  Riefenstahl broke new ground here in coverage of sports and
set new parameters still used today.  She used multiple camera settings and
removed the cameras from a fixed tripod to move them along with the action.

As a study for historians at large it shows a black American athlete, Jesse Owens,
putting the idea of Hitler's ""master race"" into the center of the trash bin with
the rest of his bizarre and often psychotic ideas.  This is a spectacular film
far ahead of its time.",1269216000,5,580,4.712871287128713
2582045,5,B000FQJA2S,"It was the 1936 Berlin Games that introduced the opening ceremony, the torch relay, the three-tiered presentation ceremony, and the overall sense of lavish, religious spectacle. In a way these are the first modern games. Does it worry you that most of the stuff we most fondly associate with the Olympics originated with the Nazis? It doesn't worry me: the Nazis' moral sense may have been deplorable, but their aesthetic sense was not nearly so bad as people like to pretend.

The most striking thing about Riefenstahl's documentary, viewed today, is its good taste. I admit I haven't seen the whole thing. Split into two parts for German release, it was edited somewhat and released simply as ""Olympia"" elsewhere, and it's ""Olympia"" that I've seen. I mention this because it's quite possible that ""Olympia"" is the version with the jingoism edited out. But I don't think so. (Surely if the film were to wave the swastika offensively, it would do so around the beginning, and the introductory sequence is just marvellous - it no more deserves to be associated with Nazism than Orff's ""Carmina Burana"".) In any case, if they edited all the jingoism out of a modern, two-hundred-hour Olympic telecast, it would last about ten minutes. It's amazing how much more crass and brazenly nationalistic modern coverage is when compared with Nazi propaganda. Riefenstahl shows races won by people other than Germans (and yes, some of them are non-Aryan) - she even shows us enough of the presentation ceremonies afterwards for us to be able to hear other national anthems! During the local coverage of the Sydney games I heard NOTHING but ""Advance Australia Fair"". Only other Australians can fully appreciate the horror of this.",1253664000,3,1717,5.003496503496503

If you have seen her most famous work, The Triumph of the Will, than you would think that this may be another one sided film showing the surpremacy of the German people.  That is not the case with Olympia.  There are even scenes of African athletes being awarded medals.  You even get to see a pretty risque shot of the director herself in the beginning of the film...

There are a few cool bonus features also.  One is a bonus photo gallery and the other is a film of Berlin in color.  It gives you a cool look at the city that Olympia was filmed in.",1253577600,,796,4.331081081081081

The most striking thing about Riefenstahl's documentary, viewed today, is its good taste. I admit I haven't seen the whole thing. Split into two parts for German release, it was edited somewhat and released simply as ""Olympia"" elsewhere, and it's ""Olympia"" that I've seen. I mention this because it's quite possible that ""Olympia"" is the version with the jingoism edited out. But I don't think so. (Surely if the film were to wave the swastika offensively, it would do so around the beginning, and the introductory sequence is just amazing.

In any case, if they edited all the jingoism out of a modern, two-hundred-hour Olympic telecast, it would last about ten minutes. It's amazing how much more crass and brazenly nationalistic modern coverage is when compared with Nazi propaganda. Riefenstahl shows races won by people other than Germans (and yes, some of them are non-Aryan) - she even shows us enough of the presentation ceremonies afterwards for us to be able to hear other national anthems!

In a way these are the first modern games. Does it worry you that most of the stuff we most fondly associate with the Olympics originated with the Nazis? It doesn't worry me: the Nazis' moral sense may have been deplorable, but their aesthetic sense was not nearly so bad as people like to pretend.

I have to say that I have seen both of these movies/documentaries and there is nothing ""overtly"" offensive.  They are merely masterpiece documentaries.

Olympia shows the Berlin Games of 1936.  It was in fact these Olympics that introduced the concepts of an Opening Ceremony, the torch relay and the three-tiered box for the medal presentation.  It also made the event an extremely lavish event as well as a somewhat religious undertone.  Riefenstahl shows races won by people other than Germans (and yes, some of them are non-Aryan) - she even shows us enough of the presentation ceremonies afterwards for us to be able to hear other national anthems.

Even so, this is a great movie.  Riefenstahl invented half the techniques that she uses here, and does them better than they're usually done today.  Plus, the Olympics are just made for her type of movie making.  She clearly loves spectacle and athleticism, and she does a good job of making you love them too.

This copy would have gotten a 5 star rating, however it is a rather shabby copy of a videotape and as soon as a new restored digital version is available forget this one and purchase the new one.

Still, the art value of this work makes it a must purchase. Reifensthal's connection with Hitler and his inner circle puts her accomplishments in film as questionable in the minds of some, however, art should be separated, in my humble opinion, from ideology.

Leni Riefenstahl's incredible skill in cinematography is on full display (as is her naked body at the beginning of the first part) and Herbert Windt's superb astounding musical score adds so much to it.

2582062,5,B000FQJA2S,"Some years ago I saw that a theater that played ""revivals"" was showing Leni Riefenstahl's OLYMPIA.  I had heard of the famed cinematographer-- whose life circumstances placed her talent in the middle of 1930's Germany. The film chronicles the famous Olympic games where Jesse Owens triumped on the world stage and Adolf Hitler dominated the political stage.  The film is long-- many many hours.  I decided to invest the six buck price of admission and just stay ""for a while"" to get an impression of Riefenstahls work--  I was mesmorized!  I couldn't leave and stayed for the whole thing (4, 5, 6 hours-- whatever it is).  When I saw OLYMPIA available on Amazon while looking for another film I grabbed it.  And, again-- (through the wonders of technology) I sat completely fascinated, entertained, transported by hours and hours of this film and found myself repeating sections more than fast forwarding.  It is truly a classic.  Anyone who loves film, the Olympics, history-- should see this film and have it in their collection. It is stylized, artful, beautiful, humorous-- (the equestrian sequences of people falling off horses is a riot). But I guess the adjective that comes most to mind is beauty-- the images, angles, light are magical and exciting.  At times the beauty of a still standing scupted object-- at times ballet, at times the raw excitement of athleticism and competition.  Over the years my love of film has led to the project of founding and running Scandinavian Film Festival L.A.  I know film makers, and curators, and heads of film institutes and have seen hundreds and hundreds of films-- I would recommend this film to any and all.

2582065,3,B000FQJA2S,"I believe this is one of the best documentaries on film ever made. This is one of my all time favorite documentary films. I think Leni Riefenstahl was one of the most innovative female movie directors to ever put a film on celluloid. She ranks up there with all the great movie directors- D W Griffith, Abel Gance, Cecil B Demille, Orson Welles etc. It's also true that she was Adolph Hitlers favorite film director and the only one that he wanted when he wanted his propoganda films made. Her most popular films such as ""Triumph Of The Will"", and ""Olympia"" are her best films. Olympia is an eye popping unbelievable film. It starts with a montage of different sights of Greece- The Acropolis etc. Then you see beautiful statues of men and women. Then with some beautiful editing she blends from a male statue into a very muscular male human. She shows men and women (some nudity) in different stages of posing and exercising to show the beauty of the human form. It sounds like it's not for children, but it is done with such good taste that with adult supervision it is not at all offensive. Now for the film quality. The quality of the film is not good, but it is definitely not unwatchable. It is dull, faded, shows  many scratches and artifacts and at times is shakey. Even the audio is pretty abysmal. Full of hiss and crackles and pops. It has definitely not been restored or remastered although some people may not be bothered by this because ,let's face it, this film was made in 1936 and some may say it should be allowed to age gracefully. It is however the complete German version. You get a choice of the original German language with English subtitles, or optional English language. This set of 2 dvds also includes many bonus features such as a deleted scene, alternate scenes from an Italian version of Olympia (which has much better picture quality than the German version), still gallery, 2 documenties , biography, and an essay. These bonus features (especially the 2 rare documentaries) save this Dvd edition of Olympia from being a total loss. Please don't misunderstand- This is still a must own film for any collection!!

8125568,4,B000FQJA2S,"This is a review of the Complete Original Version edition.
As far as Olympia the film goes, it is a masterpiece. Most of these athletes are forgotten today, so the documentary aspect of the 1936 Olympics has faded in relevance. But where Reifenstahl's real interest lies in this film - the beauty of the human form in motion - has withstood the test of time. Her long sequence of high divers leaping and flying through the sky like gods celebrating the joy of weightlessness is breathtakingly and achingly beautiful. The human animal is so seldom celebrated for its form and grace. The techniques used throughout the film were breakthroughs.
As far as this print goes, it's poor in many places. The stunning opening prologue is so dark and grainy that it is nearly unwatchable. Part two is an improvement, but still poor in many places. This film deserves a digital restoration. I was very disappointed in this transfer. If any film deserves clarity, it is this one.",1489968000,7,966,4.790419161676646
8125569,5,B000FQJA2S,"Keeping in mind the difference in technology at the time this was filmed and recorded this film get five stars.  Here is a list of pros and cons as I see it, so I hope you find it helpful.

Pros:
1. This film is important artistically and historically.
2. It gives a lens into the time and place during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, which is interesting from many points including Olympics, NSDAP, world history, culture, art, sports, the human body and movement, and cinemaphotography.
3. Leni Riegenstahl who studied painting and started her artistic career as a dancer did a wonderful job of showing beauty of the body in motion and filming, which starts with some great scenes in both parts with naked men and women bodies throwing a disc, dancing, running, swimming, sitting in a sauna, etc.  The Olympic sport scenes continue to use great angles and light.  I especially liked the scenes of high jumping, fencing and sailing.
4. This version shows both the fencing and boxing as well which were cut out of the original English version.  Audio is available in both German and English in this film with either german or english subtitles as well, excluding the fencing and boxing scenes with are in German audio.
5.  Special features are extensive and include: Biography of Leni Riegenstahl; Deleted Scene of Olympia Oath; Alternate Scenes; Still Gallery; Essay by David Calbert Smith; Jugend der Welt (Children of the World) 1937 Winter Olympics; Die Kamera Fahrt Mit (The Camera Goes Along); & DVD Production Credits (I really enjoyed the special features as well).
6.  Even though this was filmed in 1936, I found myself rooting for Britian like the outcome had not happened yet, which was fun.  I did not realize that Japan had won so many events that year.

Cons:
1. The only possible con to this film is that some the other reviews claim there are better enhanced versions to this film.  I cannot attest to this as I have only seen this version which I am pleased enough with, especially considering all the special features.",1489795200,,2034,4.769230769230769

8125571,5,B000FQJA2S,"Olympia, hailed as the greatest sports documentary of all time, fulfills the prime requirement of any documentary, by showing us something we have not seen before, and would not have seen without it.  At once a universal meditation on athleticism, as well as a snapshot of the time and place where it was produced, Olympia at the same time was groundbreaking in its use of closeups, camera angles, and tracking shots.

The film is divided into two parts, The Festival of Nations and The Festival of Beauty.  The first part opens with a 15 minute introduction, with no dialog, of Greek ruins, statues, and athletes in breathtakingly beautiful movement.  Limited throughout most of the film to having control over little more than camera placement, as she was in Triumph of the Will, the opening showcases what Riefenstahl was capable of when she could control all aspects of the image.

This is followed by a number of shorter sections, beginning with the lighting of the Olympic Torch, then focusing on a different traditional track-and-field sport; discus, shot put, long jump, racing, and so on.  The film has been criticized for its apparent glorification of Nazism and Aryan supremacy, and theres no question that Hitler when he appears on screen is presented as almost godlike, through the use of shots from below and other suggestive angles.  However, Jesse Owens and other non-European athletes are presented in the same way.  The film was financed by the International Olympic Committee, not the Nazi Party, and was produced by Riefenstahls own company.  If anything, it shows her fascination with the human form, as her later work with the Nubians demonstrated.  The primary message is the athletes phenomenal skill; if anyone doubted that throwing the discus isn't an art form, the scenes here should dispel that.

The second part opens with images of athletes practicing calisthenics, eventually showing us a group of young men in a sauna, in scenes that can only be described as homoerotic.  The sections that follow present more modern sports, such as fencing, bicycling, and swimming.  The fencing scenes include the competitors shadows, reminiscent of the closing scene in the Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood, which was also released in 1938, so its unlikely that either film influenced the other with this motif  a remarkable coincidence that both Riefenstahl and either Michael Curtiz or William Keighley came up with it independently.

One competition, titled Military, involved Army officers on horseback, traversing various obstacles.  One disturbing sequence is the trench  the most difficult, and it was  only a few competitors managed to cross it without either falling off or their horses balking.  Another sequence where competitors had to cross a stream had similar results.  These sections were also not particularly interesting from an artistic standpoint, although the horses were presented as magnificent animals.  The diving sections that followed were far superior, returning to the astonishing grace and skill of the competitors, and included an innovative shot from under water along with other remarkable camera angles that must have required extensive preparation to achieve these results.

Of greater visual interest than ""Triumph of the Will,"" and lacking the distraction of the earlier film's blatant political message, ""Olympia"" established Riefenstahl as one of the great film directors of all time.  In what must have been unprecedented at the time, Riefenstahl documented her techniques by having other cameras recording the act of filming; thus, today we can see exactly how the tracking shots were set up.  Many examples of these are shown in the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-Horrible-Life-of-Leni-Riefenstahl/dp/B00000INUB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl</a>.

Riefenstahl claimed to have been apolitical her entire life, and to never have heard of Adolf Hitler until she met him in person.  She was never a member of the Nazi party, and said that if she had been a Russian, she would have filmed for the Communists, and if she had been American, she would have made films for them.  She took great pains to depict herself as a pure artist, utilizing the resources of the state solely in the service of her art, rather than the other way around.  In some sense, this was true, at least in ""Olympia"" which cannot really be said to glorify Aryan supremacy, but the trans-national supremacy of the athlete.  Unfortunately, her choices in her subsequent production of ""Tiefland,"" Hitler's favorite opera, demonstrated her amorality in the service of her art.  Needing dark-skinned actors to play Spaniards in the production, Riefenstahl used Roma and Sinti prisoners from a nearby concentration camp.  Despite her later claims of checking up on them and confirming that they all survived the war, this contributed to her characterization as ""Hitler's filmmaker,"" and led to her later ostracism and inability to obtain outside funding for any future projects.

Olympia concludes with the inspiring view of a ring of searchlights; we follow the trajectory of their beams upwards as they converge into an image of a star.
