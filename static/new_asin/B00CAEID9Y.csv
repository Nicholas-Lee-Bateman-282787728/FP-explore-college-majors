5709536,2,B00CAEID9Y,Good attempt at some acting...  Just not an impressive story.,1407888000,,61,5.1
5709537,5,B00CAEID9Y,"It's the week of the huge wind-surfing competition, and wouldn't you know it? A gargantuan, wind-surfer-eating shark shows up to make trouble. THE LAST SHARK is a pathetic ""homage"" to JAWS, starring James Franciscus (CAT O' NINE TAILS, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES) in full, deadly boring ""Sheriff Brody"" mode, and Vic Morrow (HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE) as the ""Quint"" clone. Morrow's character displays levels of histrionics rarely captured on film! The big fish itself even has its own weak theme music, for when it's up to no good! Luckily, the d-bag mayor is on hand to secure the water by using special anti-shark netting (!!). Incredibly, it fails to stop the creature, leading to untold horror! Watch agog as wind-surfing hell erupts, rivaled only by the sailboat regatta sequence in TENTACLES! Yes, you WILL see a man-sized dummy rocket into the air! In slow-motion! Yes, the bobbly, plastic shark makes its appearance too! Yes, the underwater sequences (filmed in bathtub-vision) complete w/ rubber toy shark and model boat and helicopter are here! THE LAST SHARK is a near-perfect, hyper-schlock masterwork! Not even Morrow's on again / off again (Russian??) accent can save this soggy load of rotten kelp from tumbling into the cinematic abyss! A wondrously miserable experience for all concerned...",1401753600,2,1336,5.161290322580645
5709538,1,B00CAEID9Y,"This movie was horrible.  This was basically a remake of Jaws with different people.  The good part was the Mayor got eaten alive, unlike the Mayor in the original.",1398816000,,164,4.620689655172414
8579159,5,B00CAEID9Y,I love to order this one cause can't find this one any where,1451347200,,60,3.6923076923076925
8579160,1,B00CAEID9Y,didn't care for it,1430956800,,18,3.75
8579161,5,B00CAEID9Y,GREAT SHOW.,1423008000,,11,5.0
8579162,5,B00CAEID9Y,this was even more entertaining than we thought it would be! it makes Jaws 4 look like a snooze-fest.,1420588800,,101,4.368421052631579
8579163,5,B00CAEID9Y,good movie,1416182400,,10,4.5
8579164,2,B00CAEID9Y,"This is not a jaws movie, it has a shark but most of the movie is stock footage of different sharks.  If you like to make fun of movies like MST3000....you need this in your collection.  Not scary, not technically good, bad acting and really cheap stock footage of anonymous sharks.",1411603200,,282,4.509803921568627
8579165,5,B00CAEID9Y,"Saw this movie as a kid in Europe before I even saw the ""real"" JAWS movie.  I no doubt too young to watch this movie as I managed to gnaw off the corner of a throw-pillow that my parents had on the couch (I was hiding behind it during the 'scary' scenes :).  Was excited to see that I could finally watch it again (it was banned in the US for many, many years)....this time I didn't gnaw off any pillow corners but I enjoyed the movie even though it's predictable and somewhat cheesy special effects at times.",1410825600,,509,4.183673469387755
8579166,3,B00CAEID9Y,"Even though this film was labeled as having a similar plot as the movie ""Jaws"", it had some unique conversations and scenes.",1410307200,,124,4.681818181818182
8579167,1,B00CAEID9Y,"Bad movie, terrible fake shark, not scaring at all, but I guess the worst of all was the acting. I've never seen such a bad casting in my whole live... don't waste your time watching!",1408924800,,183,4.257142857142857
