8120778,4,B000FC2HK4,"Across northern England, there lies a stone wall still snaking through the landscape - Hadrian's Wall. This roughly one-hour DVD introduces the viewer to the wall that was built to separate the civilized world from that of the barbarians.

The DVD does a fairly good job of looking at the wall as a system with the wall itself, towers, mile castles and the ditches typical of Roman defensive works that were behind the wall. It points out that there were numerous changes to the design as time - and construction - went on. The DVD does address the differing theories on why the wall was built at all without coming down on the side of any one in particular.

There's lots of good video of surviving sections of the wall as well as the use of reenactors in Roman gear, giving the viewer a visual of the men who would have manned the wall.

I thought it was a fairly good, though not great treatment of the wall system and I give it four stars.",1470268800,2,943,4.377142857142857
