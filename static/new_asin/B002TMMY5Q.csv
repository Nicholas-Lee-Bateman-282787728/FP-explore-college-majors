3985036,5,B002TMMY5Q,"This DVD is a great example of how Davy plays live. I've seen him live twice, and, while his albums are great, they don't capture just how great a presence he is on stage. The set list features some of Davy's best work including the obligatory ""Come Home,"" ""Tear Down the Walls,"" and ""River Bend"" as well as great album tracks such as ""Country Girl,"" ""Hear Me Lord,"" and ""Gotta Leave."" There is also a great new slide guitar track (played frequently on the Chickenfoot tour) called ""In A Little While"" that shows a different side of Davy's playing. The highlight for me was probably the reworked versions of the ballads ""Roll Away"" and ""Amber's Song."" They are the kind of beautiful performances that are rarely heard now days. The bonus set by Strengyn is also a great performance. This DVD is a must have for any fan of Davy Knowles as well as any serious blues fan.",1268956800,5,868,4.5
3985037,5,B002TMMY5Q,"Wow! This is a very good band playing SRV style blues-rock. Would rank along with Joe Bonamassa, but not quite as polished. The video is very good and the audio is clear and well mixed. The band is tight and very enjoyable to watch as well as listen to. Their version of ""Almost Cut My Hair"" is VERY good and shows their style changes and vocal range of Davy Knowles. This is one I will watch again as well as pick up there CDs.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVDs and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVDs and Blu-ray's)

1.****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1264982400,7,1005,4.475409836065574
3985038,5,B002TMMY5Q,"I had the pleasure of meeting Davy Knowles when he performed in Seattle on December 12th at the infamous Crocodile Cafe. Davy and his band Back Door Slam put on a fantastic show, some of which was captured for my new music series Behind the Rock. A show that takes a fan backstage to interview their favorite artist. Intimate band interviews, rare concert footage, only at Murmur Films. As for this DVD, I own it and love it! You will not be disappointed by this soon to be blues guitar legend.

3985039,4,B002TMMY5Q,"This is a great show & performance by Davy Knowles & Backdoor Slam!  I saw him this past summer opening for Chickenfoot and I look forward to seeing him again. That being said, there's one flaw to this DVD......it was produced in ""Stereo"" format, no 5.1 etc, to me it really hurts the overall quality of this show. I had my stereo receiver up 20 more spots on the volume dial and it still wasn't loud enough. Most concert DVD's today are in 5.1, I would have certainly given this DVD 5 stars if it was. For the $23-$25 it's selling for it should have been produced in a higher quality audio format.",1264032000,7,598,4.292035398230088

8380314,4,B002TMMY5Q,I just recently discovered Davy Knowles on Pandora one day.  I took a chance buying this because I have only heard two songs by him.  I was pleasantly surprised with it.,1516838400,,169,4.419354838709677
8380315,4,B002TMMY5Q,"Released after their first album, this represents Back Door Slam at that moment in time. An honest, blues-rock band with just a hint of a softer side than most in that genre. I like it !",1505865600,,186,4.194444444444445
8380316,5,B002TMMY5Q,"I had the pleasure of Seeing Davy Knowles open up for Chickenfoot. This kid is super talented Guitar Player, true to playing the Blues. If you like the blues you will love this show.",1479686400,,182,4.382352941176471
8380317,5,B002TMMY5Q,I've followed Davy Knowles and Back Door Slam from their beginning.  They just keep getting better.  This is an excellent intro to their work.,1395964800,,142,4.875
8380318,4,B002TMMY5Q,"The only complaint that I have is the audio could have been better, But the performance was incredible. This guy has got some good guitar chops and a voice to match.",1394064000,,165,4.354838709677419
8380319,4,B002TMMY5Q,"I must agree with the other reviewer.  The sound doesn't have enough presence to it.  Sounds like you have 2 blankets over your speakers.  Performance is great, however just sound quality is low.",1375056000,,195,4.848484848484849
8380320,5,B002TMMY5Q,"It's great to see Back door Slam on DVD being I have not seen them live. It's sad to here they are no longer together, but I have the DVD to continue to watch.",1364256000,,159,3.7058823529411766
8380321,5,B002TMMY5Q,"This is a great concert dvd, very entertaining and inspiring. Davy Knowles is such a nice guy and a great musician, making this show and the extras a joy to watch! He is way better live then in the studio, which is amazing since he's great in the studio! If you like blues, or rock or anything in between then you will love this concert video. He does not disappoint with his mixture of searing lead guitar, soft acoustic and a voice that sounds a lot better and more mature then most guys barely in their 20's have. Pick up a copy today, and enjoy the show!",1313193600,2,558,4.224299065420561
8380322,5,B002TMMY5Q,Davy Knowles is such a great talent!!  If you like great songs and great guitar...check him out!!!!,1287187200,,99,4.823529411764706
