7382890,5,B0142WJ246,"CASINO ROYALE is a truly innovative and totally captivating Bond film. Daniel Craig is terrific. He combines intellect, wit and brute force and always remains the brooding thinking man's Bond. I suppose CASINO ROYALE is a re-birth or re-introduction of the series some ways and it works incredibly well. I was very impressed with David Arnold's score as well. He refers to the Bond theme very sparingly, yet it one of the best scores of the series. After DIE ANOTHER DAY took Bond in a different direction direction and pushing that envelope, CASINO ROYALE brings Bond to a more reality based world where a hero relies on his own resourcefulness and ingenuity and runs with it.

Now with the release of SPECTRE, CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE are given a new perspective and strengthens the points I have made all along. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is artistic and psychological visual storytelling. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.

Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.

SKYFALL is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? Now with SPECTRE released, I believe it is. With time, I see that this really is a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I didn't. Reflect on it I suppose. SKYFALL is a good Bond film and with the release of SPECTRE ties in QUANTUM OF SOLACE strengthening Daniel Craig's 4 Bond films.",1446854400,4,3465,4.6035598705501615
