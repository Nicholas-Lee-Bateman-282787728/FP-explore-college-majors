CNN reports about a leaked file that exposed intelligence agencies corruption. What will Matt do next?

This movie has a high amount of action and shooting. The plot is basically about retrieving an item that has great value. Think of The Maltese Falcon. The story is thin, the action makes it interesting. It mostly takes place in Capetown South Africa. Do parts of the story seem implausible?",1434326400,,3116,4.469244288224956
