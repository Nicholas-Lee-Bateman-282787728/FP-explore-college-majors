2079864,4,B0002DB59A,We had one VHS tape of Little People which my daughter loves watching over and over again so I was so happy to see this series of DVDs available. She loves this one we bought. Its no more and no less longer than I'd want her to watch in one sitting. The only problem is that one of our portable DVD players does not recognize the beginning/end of chapters. But I suspect that's a problem with the player. I would snatch them up before they go away.,1218585600,,448,4.160919540229885
2079865,3,B0002DB59A,"Well, my child has enjoyed this video for a couple of years. I am very particular about the kinds of shows I let my children watch, and this video does fit the bill as far as being sweet and wholesome and very geared towards innocent young minds. It is also somewhat educational.  For all of those reasons I say it is a good video for little ones to watch.  I could show it to any child without fear of their parent disapproving of any of the content. I can turn it on and let my own children watch it without any concerns. The trouble is, the video is also very corny. The characters are very annoying.  The adults seem to be more immature than the children.  And the story lines go beyond imaginative to being silly.  While there are several childrens' shows and videos that I personally like and even enjoy, these one really drives me crazy.  I am glad that others like it because it is so very kid-friendly.",1191628800,,911,4.329411764705882
2079866,4,B0002DB59A,"My son liked the little people toys, so I got the videos to complement them. He loves the video and still watches it a couple years later. The songs and voices are a bit annoying...as is the theme song that plays before every scene/story.",1189209600,,238,4.431818181818182
2079867,2,B0002DB59A,"Unlike some of the other Little People DVDs (e.g., the ""Friendship Collection""), this video is contrived and painful to watch.  Even our toddler can tell that it's trying too hard to be educational.",1170892800,2,198,5.0
2079868,5,B0002DB59A,"This DVD has ten shows.  You can play five in a row, or one at a time.  Each episode lasts about five minutes, so the DVD is very useful for putting in when I need five or ten minutes to get something done, but I don't want the kids watching a lot of TV.  Some of the other reviewers complained about not being able to play all ten in a row, but I like the format, because if I play five, and it rolls the credits at the end, my kids are less likely to put up a fuss when I turn it off.  The first five episodes are about ""Discovering Numbers"" and include ""Sarah Lynn's Counting Song"", ""Freddie's Froggy Family,"" ""How Much is Too Much,"" ""All Sorts of Flavors,"" and ""Follow That Sheep.""  The second five are about ""Discovering Seasons,"" and include ""Sonya Lee and the Season of Spring,"" ""Water, Water, Everywhere,"" ""The Big Blue Ribbon,"" ""Eddie and the Super Skates,"" and ""The Season of Friendship.""  The epsidoes are fun and sweet-- nothing controversial or intense.",1167782400,20,966,4.429378531073446
2079869,5,B0002DB59A,"I have a 20 month old girl that watches these over and over. She likes the wiggles, and bear in the big blue house and similiar shows.. but she loves the little people dvd's .. we just took a recent 12 hour car trip and several of these dvd's helped us stay sane on the way :)",1142812800,5,276,3.8596491228070176
2079870,5,B0002DB59A,"My son is 2.5 and this is easily his favorite DVD. I have tried all the Thomas the Train, Dora, and other videos but my son always wants to watch this one and I have no problem with the choice. The stories are nice and try to teach children to share, how to count, colors, and to understand feelings. I respect Fisher-Price's attempt to have a lesson in each episode. Lastly, check out the episode about ice cream which is easily my son's favorite.",1134000000,10,448,4.345238095238095
2079871,5,B0002DB59A,"My son who's two, loves Little People!  When I got him this video, he watched it over and over again.  There's stories about counting and sorting, and stories about the four seasons.

And as usual, most include lessons about friendship!  The stories are comical, and my son and I both enjoy the music very much.",1127865600,6,311,4.6
2079872,4,B0002DB59A,"I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection.",1124668800,7,594,4.462962962962963
2079873,4,B0002DB59A,"The kids (2yrs & 4 yrs) love the little people stories and playsets. This is the same quality stories and they do love it.

My daughter and I were a bit dissapointed that 2 of the stories were those that we had received on the VHS that came with the small barn ""Discovering animals at the farm"" (leaving only 2 other stories on the VHS). I guess I just wish that Fisher price did it the way Blues Clues did. They added episodes from the VHS as ""bonus"" episodes. (You could at least get rid of the tape!) I also don't like the menu set-up on the DVDs. It would be great if all 10 episodes would play through instead of having 5 episodes for each selection. These are my only gripes though. Fisher Price little people stories are great otherwise!",1096329600,19,744,4.276595744680851

8026694,5,B0002DB59A,Better to get the Fun To Learn Collection than buying it separately as Discovering Numbers and Discovering Seasons.  Good stuff.,1367193600,,128,5.4
8026695,1,B0002DB59A,I saw this little people movie/episode when I was younger and I really liked it! The problem is I can't remember what it was called. It was about a mail package and it gets lost in the mail. They have to find it and it really was good! Any ideas what one it is???,1363824000,,263,3.888888888888889
8026696,5,B0002DB59A,These have been the biggest hits with our little one (17mo).  He quacks along with the ducks and looks forward to the short stories which have great story value packed into a attentive time span.  The intro/out songs by Aaron Neville captures his attention right away. great collection!,1357257600,,286,4.9375
8026697,5,B0002DB59A,My daughter watched these DVD's when she was younger.  They are so entertaining and funny!  A good companion to the actual playsets.,1356739200,,132,4.954545454545454
8026698,5,B0002DB59A,"I actually bought this as our second copy - first one was used so much it got scratched.  My now 10-year-old loved it when he was little, so I got it for my 2-year-old daughter, and she watches it over and over.  Music is sweet and the characters are engaging.  She sings the song even when the movie's not on.  Happy movie.  Recommend for 2-years to 3 or 4.",1353628800,,358,4.130434782608695
