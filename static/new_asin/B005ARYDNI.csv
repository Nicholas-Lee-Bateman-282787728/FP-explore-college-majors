8463660,5,B005ARYDNI,"Five stars for excellence not because I love it but because the mothership (the other two are unwatchable imo) continues to deliver a beautiful looking show and a huge headsup re lying killers.

Now CSI will enjoy a larger audience because Archie Kao who played a minor character on the show has very publicly married a popular and respected Mainland actress.

Just in time for China to unfurl their forensic reports on the Japanese atrocities against the Chinese.

I recommend the first 11 seasons and not the first 10 because Season 11 includes Bill Irwin's villain whose sadism is very informative.

After Iris Chang's reported suicide, a man whose father's job was in Nanking to inspect the dead and keep records - personally delivered those records to the Nanjing historians without going through the Taiwanese government.

This is absolutely going to be exposed.  The Mainland government's 45 days of daily confessions by Japanese perpetrators won't even compare.

""""Nationalist China chose not to hand over to IPS investigators the vast amount of data on Chinese war casualties that Chiang's `Commission on Reparations' had been accumulating ever since 1938,"" Bix wrote. ""Nor did it pursue Japan's forced recruitment of civilian laborers, the `kill all, burn all, steal all' (sank sakusen) campaigns in North China, and the use of poison gas. These `crimes against humanity' (with the exception of the last) had taken place mostly in the Communist base areas, so Chiang Kai-shek was not interested in them.""""",1405641600,,1515,5.159183673469387
