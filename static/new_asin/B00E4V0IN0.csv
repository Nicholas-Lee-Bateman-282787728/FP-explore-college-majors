5890402,1,B00E4V0IN0,"Just about the worst ""documentary"" ever made. Rambling rants riddled with asinine conspiracy theories, horrible audio, stuff straight from the pages of the National Enquirer. As for the people involved, they are prime examples of why we still need an Electoral College. Save your 1.5 hours and $4, I beg of you.",1475452800,4,311,5.0

5890404,2,B00E4V0IN0,"No it is not real (as the 5 Star reviewer is debating) but based on supposed real events (watch the credits and you will see someone was a script supervisor.) The problem with this is that there is no real flow of the ""witnesses"" and their points (or set up to whatever they are talking about.) The ""proof"" footage is worse than most blobsquatch photos out there. The worst example is the bus driver talking about seeing a creature at 10:30 in the morning and they use the fake nighttime police car footage that was seen on ""Finding Bigfoot."" Um, did anyone think about continuity? Also, that dashcam footage looked like it was ripped (low quality) from Youtube.

The ending where the 2 kids shooting the footage disappear (spoiler alert) is incredibly anti climactic as they just start screaming and then you seen Tom Biscardi (in some incredibly bad acting) say they need to notify the authorities to start the finding process.

The DVD is bare bones and the trailer shows a still of the infamous ""frozen monkey suit"" stunt that Rick Dyer tried fooling the world with the first time around (supposedly he's trying for a 3rd time...""But this time it's for real!"") that is really out of place as this is being passed off as a horror movie/real subject.",1404345600,2,1252,4.660633484162896
5890405,5,B00E4V0IN0,"A great take on the found footage genre - so unique that Im not sure this isn't real. Everything in the movie can be ""googled"" - that is, all of the subjects and locations are easily found and documentable via a quick Google search. So is this real? Im not sure to be honest. The filmmakers cant be ""found"" but there are no missing persons reports on them that I can locate online at law enforcement sites. Regardless, there is some creepy, scary, ""rewind and play back very slow-mo"" moments here that I haven't experienced in films of this kind. Like Willow Creek, Pursuit is very engaging and quick moving. Definitely the best found-footage film Ive watched in a long time, and not ""faked"" slick like so many studio products. Perfect companion with Willow Creek and to some extent, Happy Camp.",1402963200,,795,4.6453900709219855

5890407,1,B00E4V0IN0,No bigfoot just a bunch of talk. I was really disappointed with this movie. If you are trying to prove the existence of this creature this is not the way to do it,1390953600,2,162,3.9393939393939394
