8411263,5,B000FTCGFS,I love this movie I actually cried when I saw it and the ending blew me away totally. I love Bollywood movies they are so good and they are more interesting then American movies not trying to say American movies are bad but just seeing the culture of Indian movies.  I don't usually cry in movies that much but this was the one that broken me especially the ending I didn't see it coming but wow.  I would recommend this one to anyone wants to see a good action movie and they story line was great.,1486166400,,498,4.177083333333333
8411264,5,B000FTCGFS,"Shiny Ahuja is FINE!!! He is one of the sexiest actors in Bollywood.  I haven't see sexiness like this since Amitabh Bachchan. Shiny is a very convincing actor in whatever role he plays.  I really believe that Shiny does  not get the acting credit or recognition that he has truly earned and deserves.  I watch Indian movies all of the time and I would LOVE to see Shiny Ahuja get more roles.  He's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL and in the movie Gangster, you absolutely fall in love with him.  This is one of my most favorite movies ever and Shiny Ahuja is SEXY and TALENTED AS EVER!",1396483200,2,575,4.428571428571429

This movie is so many things: raw, emotional but NOT sappy. Hindi movies can be a little sappy here and there, but this movie actually made you feel the raw desperation of unfortunate events some people call...life.

From the tender age of thirteen, Daya an orphan, was immersed in a life of crime and didn't know any other way to live...until he laid eyes on Simran.

The ultimate movie of a gangster and his woman who stuck by his side through every imaginable obstacle.

I loved how this movie made you root for the gangster, the bad guy. So many movies take a look at the gangster from a critical perspective, but there are always two sides to the story. The good guys in this movie seemed like the gangsters this time. And you will actually root for Daya (Shiney Ahuja) even though the life he lives is one of a hardened criminal.

The storyline was point on, on how it captured the life of a gangster and his love interest, Simran. Ironically, their love was the purest aspect of this movie, despite the lives they led and the circumstances in which they came to know each other.

The scene that stood out to me the most was when Simran had flashback of Daya as she is sitting on the steps of the Seoul Station. You will understand what I mean when you see this scene. It made my heart ache at seeing how Daya really loved her and would do anything for her. Don't get me wrong, this movie is about the love two people shared but because it becomes a love triangle, it will not bore you and I must repeat, nothing in this movie is SAPPY or CHEESY, believe me on this. I have seen alot of movies. Let me add that there is PASSIONATE kissing, which I gasped when I saw it. In a Hindi film? That is generally not expected, even like taboo. But I now understand that its purpose was to contrast the relationship Simran had with Akash, a nightclub singer after she got seperated from Daya. This relationship despite Akash's virgin-like qualities and looks was fiery and intense. And Simran's relationship with Daya the gangster, though born of crime was the most unadulterated, purest, respectful and flawless idolatry.

The best thing is that the ending is a twist you will never see coming. Never. I do warn this is not for the faint of heart...I was thinking of this movie long after it was done and couldn't cry at the end of it. I couldn't cry even though I really wanted to. This is the kind of ending you digest with awe and reverence.

I suggest you buy this movie, yes just buy it don't rent it, and watch it all the way through. The first time I saw it, I thought it was horrible and didn't give it a chance. A few months later,  after hearing songs from the soundtrack I thought I'd give it another chance. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did.

You will not be dissappointed. This has got to be my favorite movie of any genre, of any country, of any time period, ever made. This is an unbiased opinion.",1161907200,5,2989,4.311942959001782

I had heard a lot about Shiney Ahuja but had never seen a film featuring him. I think he truly deserves the award for the best newcomer but I won't waste my time telling you about what should be. Let me talk about what is. What Gangster is all about.

There are very few Indian films that actually go into the mind of a criminal. In Gangster, you fall in love with the criminal, who's somehow portrayed as a hero. Although I didn't familiarise or remotely relate to Shiney, I liked his character the most and it truly is an awe-inspiring performance from him. I think Kangana, the actress, despite her squeaky irritating loud voice, does a good job as a newcomer to Bollywood. Emraan Hashmi is the kind of villain you'd hate even after the film is over. I have absolutely no words can describe how good Ahuja is in this film.

Mahesh Bhatt, the man behind this film, has never been associated with a better film. This film made me feel over-enthusiastic and although I did not stand and clap at the end of it, I really am awed by it.

My favourite scene of the film is when Shiney Ahuja cries for what seems like the longest two minutes of the movie. He wins heart by breaking it. Gangster, despite the lukewarm critical acclaim, is still very under-rated. I saw it twice in the theater. The music of the film is different, one haunting track called ""Na Jaane Koi"" reminds me of a death metal band called Opeth but that's a different story while ""Ya Ali"" is the year's hit.

+ Shiney Ahuja, his eyes, his heart, his run

+ Storyline Introduction (you need ten minutes to understand what's going on)

+ Music

+ Gulshan Grover's short cameo

+ Location and sets

+ NO HAPPY ENDING

No negatives for this film. A hard-hitting entertainer.",1156809600,2,1761,4.437888198757764
