2664350,3,B000IZJR9M,Well what can I say about this movie. It is well done but it's slow. The film seems more focused on style than story. Otherwise it's worth a watch.,1441065600,,147,4.103448275862069

2664352,1,B000IZJR9M,"Waste of talented actors, story line was horrible. It was just pure violence, it made no sense. I thought it was a love story NOT!",1401148800,,130,4.24
2664353,5,B000IZJR9M,"I enjoyed watching Karam. It was not your usual Bollywood love story.  It is raw and gritty and has elements of western mafia type films, but enough love and songs to still be Bollywood.  Sanjay F. Gupta is a wonderful director and cinematographer.  I would recommend this movie.  And it has subtitles, if you don't speak Hindi.",1348444800,,328,4.701754385964913
2664354,5,B000IZJR9M,"Forget about the image on the DVD cover: this is not the typical sappy, glamorized RomCom you might expect. Unlike many Bollywood flicks, Karam actually has a good bit of violence and action in it (not like in some US movies, just enough to be engaging), and the story is interesting. John Abraham plays a hired killer for a crime lord, and after really, really screwing up (in a shocking twist, seriously), he wants out. But his boss isn't letting him off the hook so easily and forces him do ""one last job"", and that one's a biggie. John refuses to do it but when the crime lord kidnaps his wife (Priyanka Chopra), John is left with no choice...
Karam is well scripted, well acted, and well paced. Other than a few songs - which absolutely don't fit into the overall feel of this movie, but are pretty much mandatory in Bollywood productions - you may just be surprised about how dark and serious Karam is.

DVD quality itself is good. Amazon warns that this movie is manufactured ""on demand"" on a DVD-R. (What, like some guy is burning discs on his home computer?) However, it looked and played just like any regular DVD you'd buy from a mainstream manufacturer.",1316390400,4,1165,4.5476190476190474
8147902,3,B000IZJR9M,"Two of my favorite actors, John Abraham, Priyanka Chopra I enjoyed watching them but... It was ok. I just would have liked to see him as this super assassin kickin' butt more so in the beginning of the movie and her character feisty and capable of handling herself in fight. The special effects weren't the best. The songs were ok.",1471564800,,331,4.533333333333333
