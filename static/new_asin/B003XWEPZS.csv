These women are incredible, good teachers and I think have
found a real solution to fighting body fat. They are so on to
something. But I think some things went terribly wrong with the DVDs.
There seems to be a glitches in even the new DVDS. I feel these ballroom
dancers poured their souls into this -- so I can't stand that they quit making
them. I have everyone of them and bought several more due to the glitches.
I'm just heartbroken they don't make more. Jaana went on to do Figure 8, also
very good and worth it but definitely seems to target younger women. Core Rythms
seemed like they were for everyone. Heartbroken they aren't making more.",1519516800,,708,4.453846153846154

8408568,5,B003XWEPZS,The great thing about Core Rhythms Dvds is that you can choose the option to see the routines from the back which is really helpful and the workouts are terrific. Recommended!,1377388800,2,175,4.67741935483871

8408571,3,B003XWEPZS,I thought the DVD's were priced well but the quality was not so great.  The Swing Sensation is not playable at all and a few of the others has some glitches.,1310428800,,157,4.064516129032258
