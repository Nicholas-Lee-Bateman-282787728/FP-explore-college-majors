4485227,3,B004W48KI4,"Capitol Punishment: Matches rated out of 5 stars.

1: Kofi Kingston(c) vs Dolph Ziggler U.S Title: This match was good, these two have great chemistry and this match showed it, good way to start the show, fast paced and a lot of near falls and counters, the finish was fine but I would understand if you never liked it ***1/4

2. Miz vs Alex Riley: Why was this the 2nd match on the show, this was ok, pretty dull, and ordinary, only went on for like 10 minutes, Riley didn't get much offense here but when he did it was good, I loved the ending because it was very unpredictable, I was totally suprised when Riley picked up the win **1/2

3. Alberto Del Rio vs Big Show: I can completley understand if you completley hate this match, I didn't hate it that much, but I still disliked it, fist mark henry comes out and puts big show through an announce table, then it takes for ages for show to get back in the ring, we get to see a quick 3 minute match, but whenever big show stood on his feet, he would just fall back down, worst match of the night *1/2

4. Wade Barret(c) vs Ezekial Jackson I.C Title: This actually wasn't that bad, I wasn't looking forward to this match after seeing there match at Over The Limit but it was actually ok, it was kept short, only like 6 minutes which was good, Jackson looked like a beast, and Barret also looked good on the offense **1/4

5. Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk: This match was very good, my 2nd favourite match of the night, a lot of nice moves, rey hits a sick moonsault onto Punk, some lovely counters here, a back and forth match, the ending was brilliant and vefry different, I loved everything about this match ***3/4

6. Randy Orton(c) vs Christian WH Title: This is my favourite match of the night, it was very good, very fast paced, load of moves, some that i've never seen before, lots of action here, Christian reversed the RKO a lot, I would of loved to have seen this go on a few minutes longer though, the ending was contraversial and weird, oh well, match was still very good ***3/4

7. Evan Bourne vs Jack Swagger: This was actually a good filler match, I felt into this match, Evan Bourne is one of my favourtites in the WWE, the match itself was pretty good, a lot of nice power moves from swagger and some high flying moves from Evan **3/4

8. John Cena(c) vs R-Truth WWE Title: This was just like any other John Cena match, very boring and slow paced up till the last 2 minutes, I didn't like this match, it was hyped so well on RAW but in my opinion it just never delivered, I stongly dislike Cena and his wrestling abilties, I like the new R-Truth and I hope he gets another chance at the title because I believe he can put on a lot better perfomance than this one,the last few minutes to the match were entertaining but it didn't save the match itself, the ending was crap, and silly so I think I am giving this match a fair rating **1/2

Match of the Night: Orton vs Christian
Worst Match of Night: Del Rio vs Big Show
Moment of Night: Riley pins the Miz!!!!

Overall PPV: 7/10

This PPV was pretty good but not very memerable, I would also like to say that the thing with the fake Barak Obama was horrendous and awful and hurt my eyes!!!",1308700800,,3202,4.241379310344827
4485228,3,B004W48KI4,"I am writing this review as I'm watching it online. It had a well planned card unlike Over the Limit, although many of these matches weren't very original. Had a lot of advertising and heat which made it very exciting. Special guest appearance by Obama.

1. United States Championship
Kofi Kingston(c) vs. Dolph Ziggler
Pretty heated, normal paced, and solid match. It is never boring to watch two former rising stars such as Kingston and Ziggler with championship on the line. This was a simple way to to start the show since it never was too bad as openers of SummerSlam and NOC in 2010. Also, Vickie Guererro wasn't interfering as much as she usually does on Ziggler's behalf so it was a fair fight. 1/4

2. The Miz vs. Alex Riley
This felt a little like a squash match with Miz on the upper hand during the late beginning and middle. When Alex Riley finally got the upper hand, he was pretty cool to watch. Alex Riley had a lot of heat with Miz with few cheers during the bout. 1/2 Not bad

3. Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio
I was shocked that this matched even happened. I knew that it wouldn't just be Big Show beating the living hell out of Del Rio. This was also a squash match on Alberto Del Rio's upper hand which made it a little stupid. This was only because of the outside interference from Mark Henry. I can't exactly remember when Henry turned heel. No rating

4. Intercontinental Championship
Wade Barrett(c) vs. Ezekiel Jackson
This was a giant vs giant contest. Not much to say other than it was worth watching. Come to think of it, the match was pretty good for a short match. Just think of it as CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio at WM 26. That match was short and incredible. The match started with Barrett making a promo trashing D.C. I know it was fake. To be honest, I was following Barrett. (By he way, he was in the SmackDown! Money in the Bank Ladder Match next PPV and I predicted he was gonna be the winner. The PPV hasn't happened yet) 1/4

5. CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio
This is just what the WWE Universe has been waiting for. Faced paced and exciting. These two have experience from their rivalry in early-middle 2010. A lot of credit to these men for there reversals. The fans seemed to be a little more on Punk's side for the upper hand. 3/4

6. World Heavyweight Championship
Randy Orton (c) vs. Christian
MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!! I thought that this wasn't going to be as good as their match at Over the Limit, but I was wrong. This was back and forth, face paced and just great. Christian showed the most amount of talent in this match. WWE should keep this rivalry going for a while. 3/4

7. Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger
This was a last minute match following their quick match rivalry throught the past few weeks. This match actually lasted the longest and was probably the most face-paced match on the card. Not bad for a speed vs. power type of match. 1/2

8. WWE Championship
John Cena(c) vs. R-Truth
I didn't think that this was good at all. It lasted longer than I expected, but it was too general. R-Truth used his normal technique on Cena. This should've been longer and more detailed. I hope this rivalry ends soon, WWE. 1/4

I never noticed how many of these matches were repeated from past rivalries. One problem was the matches ended too many times in submission. I suspected a better event due to the unique card it had. I think this event should get a little credit. If you read my old review, I am sorry that I was too positive.",1308441600,,3465,4.368012422360248

United States Championship Match
Kofi Kingston(c) vs. Dolph Ziggler (w/ Vickie Guerreo)  3.5/5
- Even though we've seen this match a thousand or so times, they still put on a great match. And they did the same here. Ziggler gets the win after making Kofi passout with the Sleeper. And it was his first and only(so far) U.S. Championship.

The Miz vs. Alex Riley  3/5
- Teacher vs. Student in the match up. I liked the push they gave Riley, I was a fan. Alex Riley gets the win over his former mentor.

Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio 2.7/5
- This was an alright match. I liked to think it was the offical start to the ""Hall of Pain"" Mark Henry, when he came out and destroyed Big Show before the match. Del Rio gets the after taking advantage of Show's injured leg.

Intercontienal Championship Match
Wade Barrett(c) vs. Ezekiel Jackson  2.3/5
- An decent match here. Jackson gets the win after making Barrett tap to the Torture Rack.

Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk  4/5
- I honestly think thos was the 'Match of the Night'. They had a great match here, and CM Punk got the win.

World Heavyweight Championship Match
Randy Orton(c) vs. Christian  3.7/5
- These two have great chemistry, but this wasn't there best match with eachother. It still entertaining though. One of the top feuds of 2011. Ortob gets the after hitting a RKO.

Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger 2.4/5
- I thought this match was boring. So, Evan gets the win in this one.

WWE Championship Match
John Cena(c) vs. R-Truth  2.5/5
- The main event of the pay-per-view. But.. It certainly didn't feel like it. Cena gets the win, of course, and retains the WWE Championship.

CAPITOL PUNISHMENT 2011

This was a better event than most give it credit for and had some pretty good matches. I don't think any were classics but they were good. Also the fake Obama thing was just not well done, like the actor they got but still. It would have been really cool for the Prez to make his return to WWE TV, been to long since the last time [during the election run on course was the last time].

1[US TITLE]KOFI KINGSTON VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-now I don't know what any one else thinks but I think this was a great opening match. Great back and forth action with various counters and high spots. In the end Dolph becomes the new US champ after making Kofi go to sleep with a sleeper.

2. THE MIZ VS ALEX RILEY-now let it be known I am a Miz fan. Yes you read that I am a fan of the Miz so every time he wrestles I am rooting for him. Here he is going against his old protg Alex [great first name] in a nice grudge match. Miz is in control for most of the match but Alex holds his own. The best is when Alex went after Cole, every one loved that. Alex pulls out the win with DDT and the Miz goes down to his former student.

3. BIG SHOW VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-this match was actually highly entertaining in my opinion. From Show jumping Del Rio at the beginning to Mark Henry attacking Show after that, all the way to the end. This match was to me mainly because they played up Show having his leg hurt and Del Rio just going after it like a good heel would. Plus it has been a while since they had a ref stop a match. Del Rio gets the referee stoppage win here.

4.[I-C TITLE]WADE BARRETT VS EZEKEL JACKSON-now I have to say that I am a big fan of Wade Barrett and was rooting for him all the way here. I can't help it but I just love heels for some reason. This is a much better match than people are giving it credit for. Jackson showcases his power of course in this match and even kicks out of Wade's finisher on his way to becoming the new I-C champion.

5. CM PUNK VS REY MYSTERIO-the match I knew was going to be one of the best on the card did not disappoint since these two always deliver together. This of course was a good match indeed and had some great back and forth action. Of course Punk countering Rey's 619 into the GTS was brilliant. Love this match with Punk getting the win.

6.[WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS CHRISTIAN-of course we all know the story going into this one with Christian wanting the title back after getting a quick taste of it. Me personally love Christian as both a heel and face but I he works so much better as a heel. This was another good match although not as great as others they have had. Still it is a good match with a good pace and high impact moves from both. Orton would win with an RKO but Christian had his foot under the rope so that would play out later.

7. EVAN BOURNE VS JACK SWAGGER-this was an added bonus match and since both of these guys can deliver I am glad we got the match. I mean it makes since that the all American American would be here like the commentators say. This is a good short showcasing of these two and their talents. Bourne takes the win in a short but fun match.

8.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS R-TRUTH-now I think that this was an excellent storyline and had a great build up. I have always liked Ron Killings all the way back to his K-Kwik days, my grandfather, brother, sister, and I were even at a house show when he debuted in the WWF. This was before he debuted on Raw so that was cool. Any way I think this his is best run ever and most entertaining for any promotion, gotta love Lil Jimmy. I gotta say that I really do enjoy this match with Truth controlling most of it. He dominates Cena most of the time but still comes up short. It is funny how Truth gets beat with the kid and everything, but the funny thing is Truth before it happens. I just love his facial expressions while he is taking that kids drink, cracks me up. Cena then hits an AA after the kid throws the drink in Truth's face and gets the win.

This was a good event and fun over all, not the greatest ever but it was still good.",1316304000,,4089,4.093632958801498
8444360,3,B004W48KI4,"WWE Capitol Punishment is a good show.  If you're a WWE fan, you will enjoy it.  However, the quality of the dvd is terrible.  The show looks like someone downloaded it from the internet.  Thankfully Money in the Bank and SummerSlam do not look like this.  I recommend if you are a collector.",1316217600,2,292,4.433962264150943
8444361,4,B004W48KI4,"The CM Punk-Rey Mysterio match was the best on the card and good reminders of Punk's bouts against Samoa Joe from Ring of Honor and Rey's matches against Eddie Guerrero back in WCW. The WWE title bout between John Cena & Ron Killings was desperately disappointing as watching Kevin James's film:Zookeeper. The World title match between Randy Otron & Christian was just as good as thier bout from Over The Limit even with the lame ""foot under the rope"" ending. The rest were ok. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1314144000,,510,4.494623655913978

8444363,3,B004W48KI4,"United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler - For those keeping track, this is the fifth time in the past year (Money In The Bank, SummerSlam, Night Of Champions, T.L.C.) have went against each other in a match so both knew each other extremely well & showed that here as both were able to kick out & counter each others signature moves throughout the match such as the S.O.S., Kofi's flying crossbody, and Dolph's Zig Zag with a finish that even left the announcers confused on what happened.  They wrestled a fine match as they usually do but this didn't top the quality of other encounters they've had before & after this match.

Alex Riley vs. The Miz - ""Student vs. Teacher"" here in Riley's hometown as Miz trash talked early before he Riley responded with punches before Miz was able to take back control for a most of the match.  Michael Cole was pro-Miz & anti-Riley throughout the match but when Riley was able to get his second wind, he showed he wasn't taking any crap from anyone...from Miz's own ego (which came back to bite him) to Cole himself.  The match itself was average but it did it's job in establishing Riley as a no nonsense babyface.

Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio - Show attacked Rio during his entrance & began to beat the hell out of him for his leg being ran over by his car weeks ago before Mark Henry ran out & got revenge on his own on Show from his attack days earlier on SmackDown including showing why the name ""World's Strongest Man"" isn't just a nickname while re-injuring Show's leg.  Show was able to easily overpower Del Rio but clearly favoring his leg & only kept hurting it more such as when he delivered a chokeslam to the point where Del Rio targeted his leg with his cross arm-breaker on his leg injuring it to the point where Show couldn't even stand on it causing the referee to stop the match.  This was more of an angle than a match but it worked out better than a normal match would have between them which worked out well on all ends as it gave Del Rio the momentum he hasn't had in months while establishing both Show & Henry as giant powerful monsters.

Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. Ezekel Jackson - Before I get started, Barrett gave this anti-American promo causing the crowd to chant ""USA"" in favor of Jackson which caused Cole to point out a funny fact of how Jackson isn't American either while it should also be noted that Barrett didn't have help from The Corre as the group broke up days earlier on SmackDown.  Just like how the entire feud was designed to do, this match was all about establishing Jackson as a dominate powerhouse as he used his strength with power moves while also doing he can take punishment & keep going such as kicking out of Barrett's Wasteland.  The match wasn't much of anything past that fact except that the crowd loudly showing that they really wanted a ""Woo Woo Woo"" during this match.

Rey Mysterio vs. C.M. Punk - Just like how I said earlier that Ziggler & Dolph had battled previous times throughout the past year, this match is happening one year later after last singles PPV match with Punk's group of the New Nexus banned from ringside while Punk also had an outfit that fit the ""theme"" of the event.  Both men had some nice back & forth wrestling with both men showing that they knew the other very well such as Punk catching Rey's attempted press off the apron to drop him on the barricade while constantly countering the 619 while working on the midsection of Mysterio with various moves such as a bow & arrow, abdominal stretch, and body scissors. Rey resorted to his various aerial offense such as the flying headbutt & Asai Moonsault before Punk was able to reverse the flying crossbody leading to a great sequence of both men attempting to nail a kick.  Mysterio was able to hurt Punk's arm earlier in the match to the point where Punk hurt it himself when delivering a simple back superplex while Punk also had the same effect on his knees when blocking a top rope splash before going into another series of moves evolving from a GTS, frankensteiner, knockout kick, and 619.  While their series was quality last year, this match may have topped that as it was a great match with all the unique reversals and offensive maneuvers outside of their normal moves.  Definitely the match of the night here.

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Christian - Orton came into this match looking for revenge for his concussion and pounded on Christian right away with punches & even a big boot to the face while trying to end the match early with various close near falls.  Christian focused on Orton's head with various stomps & calculated punches while tossing his head into the steps & also doing his moves with more impact like the spinebuster that had Orton's head bounce off the mat.  Orton kept fighting back with shoulderblocks & suplexes but at one point delivered a superplex that even hurt Orton as his head bounced off the mat.  There was a good series of counters & reversals towards the end as both men knew each others signature moves so well leading towards the end of the match (which was controversial) before Orton gave Christian a taste of his own medicine afterwords.  This was a very good match but wasn't the quality of their previous two encounters as they played it safe here knowing how Orton, in reality, was recovering from a concussion.

Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger - This was a bonus match based off their issues over the past few weeks on RAW but before the match, ""Keith Stone"" from the Keystone Light Beer commercials came out & sat at ringside with the Bella Twins.  This had it's moments such as one moment when Bourne went for a hip toss and nailed several moves to avoid Swagger but was finally grabbed and nailed with a gut buster across the knees several times.  Swagger focused on his midsection with elbows & his running Vader splash off the corner ropes with Bourne able to counter & plant a DDT from the top rope followed by a series of counters from Swagger's powerbomb to an eventual rollup. Another nice match but at times seemed like a backdrop to promote ""Keith Stone""

Now throughout the night, there were backstage skits involving ""President Obama"" (who looked more like Tiger Woods) & various WWE superstars but right around here was when Obama himself came out to do a speech that was filled with nothing more than bad jokes & doing a spinaroonie with Booker T to the point where the only things that were entertaining about it was the comment he made towards Jim Ross & the crowd doing their infamous ""WHAT?"" chants.  Press ""SKIP"" right here because WWE apparently haven't learned their lesson from WrestleMania about stopping the show just to do unfunny skits.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. R-Truth - Truth walked out with Cena's title as he stole it the week before while Cena came out to his usual ""mixed"" reaction from the fans along with some ""Little Jimmy"" chants.  This was a good showcasing for Truth in that he was very dominate throughout the bout as he kept mocking Cena while being able to keep countering & escaping Cena's moves of the A.A. & STF.  Unfortunately there isn't much to say here past that & the fans having fun with the dueling chants as this was the ""stereotypical"" Cena match where he was dominated for a majority of the bout only to make his comeback with his ""moves of doom"" to win the match but even I have to admit that the way it was setup involving ""Little Jimmy"" did get a chuckle out of me.

This was one of those PPV's that had good matches on it & segments that did their job in establishing talent but there nothing on here that you haven't already seen on a previous PPV or on free TV (hence the title of this review) past the Punk/Mysterio match (which may be the best one they've had) so this is something I would recommend for a rental or only get if your a hardcore Mysterio/Punk fan.",1309651200,4,7894,4.523876404494382
