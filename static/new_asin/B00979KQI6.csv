8537295,5,B00979KQI6,"Sallys boyfriend dies in a plane accident and leaves her pregnant and alone. Unable to raise her child, she gives him up for adoption. Yearning for her lost child, she schemes to get him back in her life. This Pre-Code gem offers great acting with Ann Harding playing a very sympathetic role to perfection. This is an emotional, suspenseful film with its only weakness being the plot line moving too quickly with unlikely coincidences. The film is totally engaging from beginning to end, and Id deem it must see viewing.",1520380800,,520,4.788888888888889

8537298,5,B00979KQI6,"The early 1930s was famed as one of the most freewheeling eras in Hollywood history. And certainly one of the staple genres of that period was the ""unwed mother"" genre. Constance Bennett, Kay Francis, Helen Hayes, Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert all served time in this genre, and so did Ann Harding. Usually, Ann Harding was one of those noble sufferers, but, here, she's working with Gregory La Cava, one of the masters of film comedy in the 1930s. As he did with STAGE DOOR (1937), La Cava takes the basic story, and he fills the edges with humor. In STAGE DOOR, he had the chorus of aspiring actresses, all ready with wisecracks and jokes, to leaven the central story (one actress - played by Katharine Hepburn - on the rise while the other actress - played by Andrea Leeds - is on the downslide). Here, Ann Harding's woebegone heroine (why do the men always die right after having sex? the women may get pregnant, but the guys die) doesn't get to mope too long: she's surrounded by friends who always lighten the situation, chief among them Clive Brook and Janet Beecher. Pretty soon, the mood of the film becomes gently comic, and it really becomes funny when the major plot twist happens midway through the movie.

In terms of this product: the Fox MOD releases so far have been decent, but not spectacular. I've gotten mostly films which were done in 1:33 format, and in black-and-white, and the prints seem to be decent, with a few scratches and marks, but nothing egregious. But i've heard that many of the 'Scope and color films from the 1950s are unrestored, often pan-and-scan, and look terrible, so be warned. But if you want a black-and-white early sound film from Fox, 20th Century, or the combined 20th Century-Fox (after 1934), then these DV-Rs are the way to go. GALLANT LADY is in pretty good shape, considering its age, and the DV-R is just fine.",1355011200,16,1866,4.654545454545454
