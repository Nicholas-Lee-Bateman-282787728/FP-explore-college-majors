7945512,4,B00005MIR0,"For the British Queen Victoria is an icon in British history, but for the natives of British colonies, Her Majesty is the queen of mean for the rest of world.

In order to colonize chosen areas the British killed and enslaved the natives who dared to resist. The laws were only imposed upon the natives and not valid to the British. The British by any mean shipped the best of anything from the colonies to England; some given to the Queen or her family members; some remained in the British Museum; some granted to those who wre knighted.

Foe example Greek government has been requesting the British for returning statutes.",1280102400,,625,4.672727272727273
7945513,5,B00005MIR0,"Queen Victoria's Empire provides a good overview of problems faced by Her Majesty's government in aquiring and managing the British Empire.  The switch in approach toward empire following the death of Albert is also highlighted though I feel that the historian Weintraub overstates the role that Albert played in Victoria's government.  The dramatization of events interlaced with historical commentary by noted experts provides the context in which to view the period.  My students enjoy watching it as they gain a greater insight by viewing the people, places, and events after they have read their textbook.",1227052800,,610,5.4
7945514,4,B00005MIR0,"If you're looking for a good basic understanding of the British Empire under Queen Victoria, I couldn't think of a better place to get it.
Narrated by Donald Sutherland, what I found so fascinating about this entire video were the ties you could make after watching it between Victorian times and today.  The disputes over globalization (although the sides have flip-flopped somewhat), the leftover problems in Africa and India that we're still dealing with and the parliamentary debates of Victoria's time all reflect problems we're still wrestling with.
Well worth the watch...!",999648000,15,580,5.304347826086956
7945515,3,B00005MIR0,"Queen Victoria's Empire takes you on a journey of one of the world's most vast empires under a single sovereign.
The series comprises of four hours - each focusing on a different aspect of the Victorian empire. The first hour looks at how the nation rocketed to industrial status with the invention of the steam engine while her people suffered under the adverse effects of the Industrial Revolution.
The second hour is primarily based on the conquest of India, first under the East India Company and then the transfer of India to the British Crown after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.
Exploration of Africa by Livingstone and a tussle of power between Disraeli and Gladstone form the main subject of the third part. The last hour further focuses on expansion into Africa by Rhodes.
Throughout the first two hours, there is considerable attention given to Queen Victoria's husband - an idealist and a supporter of new technology - and how he was a guide and mentor to her. One sees how Queen Victoria's persona changes after she loses her husband.
The other part covered through most of the four hours is the animosity between Disraeli and Gladstone. Disraeli's goals for the empire centered on increased imperial conquests and it was he and his ideals that were in favor with the Queen.
The narration in the entire series is excellent which is typical of PBS documentaries. It is also full of narration from Queen Victoria's own diary which gives an insight into her actual thoughts instead of interpretations by biographers.
Nevertheless, with a four hour running time, the series is needlessly stretched. It covers small events which might not have been necessary. Due to this, it becomes hard to maintain the viewer's interest for the entire 4 hours unless one is really interested in the subject.",995155200,13,1796,4.891803278688524
