3801609,5,B001UIDREM,"I was in the middle of training for a Sprint Triathlon and a Marathon in 2011 when I became pregnant with my first child. My husband has been training with KBs for sometime and already bought me some ""ladies"" weight kbs. I purchased one or two Pregnancy workout vidoes before this one (non-KB) and they are boring to tears! Because I am 40, my doc has told me not to run (though I think he is being overly cautious) so I am very frustrated not being able to get a good solid workout in that will keep me strong without putting my little one into danger.

THIS VIDEO is what I have been looking for. It's sufficiently challenging, well paced, and a good use of time. The instructor is extremely pregnant herself and demonstrates everything, and includes a modification caption. The video gets your heart pumping, but keeps moving, allowing you to pause the video for how long you need to catch your breath. I really like that, so the pace of the video is solid.  I definitely feel this the next day.

If you're brand new, get it, and work your way into it, and if you've been exercising before, I think you'll be happy with this video, it'll keep you working.",1303689600,4,1158,4.427230046948357
3801610,5,B001UIDREM,"I bought a Kettlebell last Summer and it came with a DVD that had three 15 minute workouts on it...I liked it ok but wanted something a bit more.  Plus I was going to be trying for baby number two soon, so I wanted something to workout to while pregnant.  I LOVE this workout DVD.  I bought two other different workout pregnancy DVD's also and all I can say is this one Baby Bells is the only one I will be working out to.",1303084800,,422,4.0
3801611,4,B001UIDREM,"This was the my main workout during my recent pregnancy.  Most everything else I tried held no challenge.  Other reviewers have summed it up well.  If I had to say I anything negative about this, it would be that it seems rather low budget for the price.  Didn't LOVE the music.  And Lauren, while in FANTASTIC shape, doesn't seem thrilled to be there.  I can't remember if she smiles even once!  None of these were a deal breaker for me.  Lauren's credentials are excellent.  This workout is also an excellent intro to kettlebells.",1300147200,,532,4.634408602150538
3801612,5,B001UIDREM,"kettlebell workouts are wonderful prenatal workouts if you have prior kettlebell experience.  when it's tough to motivate yourself to workout, being able to pop in this dvd is great!  my midwives say i have abs of steel, and i know that utilizing this dvd has helped me reatain a decent level of conditioning.",1296950400,,309,4.811320754716981
3801613,4,B001UIDREM,"This is an awesome workout.  I love the fact that she is working with heavier weights during her 6th month of pregnancy.  My husband has been driving me nuts with all of his worry about me lifing anything or continuing my workouts, I'm about to hit six months in a week, so it was nice to be able to point out that if the instructor can do it so can I.  I'm a firm believer in not sitting around and getting fat and out of shape and want to maintain an active lifestyle during my pregnancy.  This DVD will help me to that.",1274400000,3,522,4.038834951456311
3801614,5,B001UIDREM,"As a disclaimer, I'm not pregnant, but I'll sure save this DVD for down the road.  I wanted to get into kettlebells, but I was concerned about my joints.  I've had bursitis in my hips and knees, so I looked for a DVD that was low-impact.  What I really like about this workout is that there are alternate forms for many of the exercises, which provides me with a way to complete the exercise without straining anything.  There are some exercises here I just can't do, even with the alternate forms: the lunges and squats just aren't going to happen, so I'll walk in place until she moves on to the next exercise.  I was very pleased with the variety of the exercises, and I thought the instructor was excellent.  Even as a complete kettlebell beginner, I felt confident with her instruction.  I just wish I could find more of her DVDs on Amazon!",1274313600,3,845,4.4480519480519485
3801615,5,B001UIDREM,"This is my second pregnancy and I have used Kettlebells before. This is a wonderful and challenging workout for any pregnant person who is familiar with either Kettlebells, crossfit, or body building prior to pregnancy. Proper form during the exercises may be difficult to achieve or understand for those who are new to working out or strength training. Those who are not confidant because they are new to pregnancy or working out may have concerns about trying different exercises, but don't worry it is all safe plus there is a modified version of each exercise shown in the video. Also, I would suggest coupling the video with additional stretching or a prenatal Yoga video. This is a challenging and effective yet safe workout. I am loving it, I will be using it as a postnatal shape up as well. If you like this video or are looking for a video like this but think kettlebells are no right for you might also want check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Pregnancy-Workout-vol-1/dp/B000BLKJ5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1</a>.

I would recommend that once in your second trimester or further in your pregnancy you reduce the number of exercises you do with the kettlebell as you follow the video or consider doing just one of the workout segments per workout plus warm up and cool down. As well as, decreasing the amount of weight you use as you progress in your pregnancy. Plus remember to take water breaks and let your heart rate come down in between every circuit in the video.

Do not start this video if you have not been working out, are new to working out, and in your second trimester or further. I would think the combination of the three together would make this video way to difficult for you.",1267142400,11,1801,5.040268456375839
3801616,5,B001UIDREM,"I am new to kettlebells and to pregnancy (it's my first time!).  I got this DVD on the recommendation of my favorite women's fitness blog and I am very happy with my purchase.  I believe that pregnancy is not a time to wimp out on working out.  Although there are some obvious physical limitations, it's healthy for you and your baby to stay fit throughout your pregnancy.

We quit the gym to save money and I needed something to kickstart me back into working out at home.  I wanted a workout that was somewhat challenging.  I also wanted something that was fun to do.  The Baby Bells workout is fast paced and the instructor (Lauren Brooks) moves you through the workout in a serious and straightforward manner.  It's so great to see her beautiful baby belly too.

If you are into kettlebell training or simply want to try something new and stay fit throughout your pregnancy, I would highly recommend this DVD.  This DVD is probably great for beginners and intermediates.  Although, she uses kettlebells, she also instructs that each weight lifting movement can also be done with regular dumbbells.  Each movement also has an unweighted option if you're uncomfortable with weights.",1258502400,9,1184,4.806930693069307
3801617,5,B001UIDREM,"First, let me say I am a newbie to kettlebell work and far from an expert on this subject.  This DVD appears to have been designed for pregnant women who wish to keep training, but is probably not meant for a pregnant woman looking to start a new exercise regime.  I am not pregnant, but I am not in fantastic athletic shape either, so I purchased this hoping it would challenge me, but  not be so killer that I would give up in frustration.  This routine is less intense than Lauren's first DVD, or Sarah Lurie's Iron Core I, which are my only other kettlebell DVDs.  However, I am not saying that this work out is easy - Lauren is about 6 1/2 months pregnant and still puts me to shame.  The DVD is chaptered and includes a joint mobility/warm-up, three workout sections and a cool-down stretch; if you do all of them together, it clocks in around 40 minutes.  It is just Lauren, no background exercisers, and she takes you through two sets of various kettlebell and body weight moves in each of the three sections.  For many moves, she shows modifications via picture in picture in the corner.  She alternates between three different weight kettlebells depending on what move she is doing (but never uses more than one kettlebell at a time).  I only own an 18# bell, so I just use that, except I use an 8# dumbbell to do halos for now.  She does 2-handed swings, overhead swings, sumo squats, push-ups, lunges, triceps extensions and a lot of other moves I can't remember off the top of my head.  If you need form pointers to learn the moves, you should check out Lauren's other DVD (or, ideally, meet personally with an RKC trainer).  The music is soft & relaxing; Lauren's demeanor is calm & serious; the production values are very good.  I am really enjoying this DVD.  There is no dread factor for me and the slower pace allows me to focus on my form, rather than feeling I have to race to keep up and then getting discouraged.  I am very happy with my purchase!",1239235200,30,1969,4.427777777777778
3801618,5,B001UIDREM,"I did a lot of heavy lifting before getting pregnant and dabbled with kettlebells here and there. If you're not a fitness newbie, this workout isn't particularly difficult, but it's feels really good and usually leaves me feeling a burn in my hips/thighs and shoulders/upper back the next day. When I first did the DVD around 20 weeks pregnant, I thought it was pretty easy but still enjoyed it. Now at 30 weeks it is much more of a challenge and I'm glad I kept up with it. Lauren is no-nonsense and easy to follow. Highly recommend.",1431561600,,534,4.515463917525773
3801619,5,B001UIDREM,"Unlike other prenatal workout which seem to accommodate mostly sedentary women, this is a fun short yet challenging workout. I am currently 6 months pregnant and I usually do this workout twice a week after a 3 mile run or a 20 min modified HIIT workout. Even if you don't work out that much you can easily do this workout with dumbbells or smaller kettle bells or no kettle bells at all depending on your overall fitness.
What I find particularly great is that
- it is so easy to modify the intensity by using simply different sized kettlebells or just dumbbells
- this whole workout is tailored around the muscle groups that are so important during pregnancy and afterwards. Pelvic floor strengthening, Sumo squats, modified push-ups, hip flexor stretch, squats in the birthing position etc.

I also started doing Karyne Steben's Perfect Pregnancy Workout once to twice a week and I highly recommend this as well especially in the second and third trimester.",1429228800,,960,4.853658536585366

3801621,4,B001UIDREM,"Good exercises and great modifications. I would have appreciated more instruction on correct form, as I'm a fitness professional and picky about that, but for more advanced exercisers it should be no problem. I enjoyed that she is so pregnant doing the exercises, but I wish she had a full shirt on. My husband walked by when I was doing the video and said ""why doesn't she have a shirt on?"" Overall I'm really glad I got this DVD.

It did come scratched though (bought used in ""excellent condition""), so I just have to rewind to do two sets of the second set of exercises, or just remember what we did and repeat them. Not too big of a deal though.",1424044800,,649,4.363636363636363

3801623,5,B001UIDREM,"If you are like me and work in an office 10+ hours a day SITTING all day and haven't workout out in years, this video is for you whether you are pregnant or not. I tried Lauren's Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells DVD and it was wayyyyy to hard for me (non pregnant). I could barely do it with either no kettlebell or a baby 10lb bell. Then my recovery was so long after I gave up. If I would have tried this one I could have kept up with it. And it's fun to watch Lauren's belly!

Now that I am pregnant I tried this and I could actually do it with a 10lb bell (or no bell) and am in the 1 week recovery range. I want to keep doing it once a week until I recover faster and can work up to more. I like that is is safe for all trimesters so you can use it the entire pregnancy. Lauren is good in letting you rest to get your heart rate down, and at 38 minutes you can still do it with your preggo exhaustion. She says you can do it with a dumbbell as well. And it actually has enough of a warm up and cool down that you don't have to do more before/after like most videos that only have like a 30 sec cool down.

Only negative: this video offers NO instruction. You need to know how to do the kettlebell swing, overhead swing, clean & press. I learned how to do these from Lauren's instruction in her other DVD. Or look on Youtube. Otherwise everything is very simple.

BONUS: if you buy from Lauren's website she has a pregnancy e-book with TONNNNNS of preggo kettlebell workouts if you are more experienced!",1392768000,,1529,4.073089700996678
3801624,5,B001UIDREM,"This is a tough but doable workout.  I'm not currently pregnant, but wanted to get into better shape before pregnancy and be able to continue once pregnant.  I'm a newbie to kettle bells, but absolutely love it!  They take up very little space and are a great workout while kiddos are sleeping and you can't spend hours at the gym.  My husband (in good shape) has done the workout with much heavier bells than me and agrees that this is a tough workout.  Not for someone who is pregnant and never worked out before.  Definitely recommend!",1391990400,,538,4.552083333333333
3801625,1,B001UIDREM,"This workout was way too easy - it was like doing nothing. A regular kettle bell workout is just fine.
Maybe if you never workout you will like it, but then again if you are pregnant you shouldn't just be starting to workout.",1385683200,,225,4.255813953488372
3801626,4,B001UIDREM,"A great video for pregnant women in all trimesters, but also just a challenging workout by itself. There are plenty of modifications I can make to keep doing the video beyond my pregnancy, and to keep it challenging.",1379289600,,216,4.7105263157894735
3801627,4,B001UIDREM,"I like this DVD a lot. I think the workout works for before, during and after pregnancy so the price is a solid value. The workout is broken into 3 segments which I liked as an ""express"" option if pressed for time or just tired. If you went into your pregnancy fit and are looking for a safe but challenging option to keep using kettle bells or weights you will be happy with this DVD. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my heart rate was in a moderate range the entire time.

Here is one thing you should be aware of in this DVD. Lauren seems to assume some experience with kettle bells so the moves aren't broken down extensively. This is good for run time but potentially problematic if you haven't used kettle bells before. Although this DVD is designed for pregnancy you should remember that you can injure yourself doing kettle bells the wrong way pregnant or not.

If you haven't used kettle bells before or have limited experience with them I would strongly suggest doing the following:
1. Watch all 3 workouts in their entirely (without doing them) and make a note of any moves you haven't done before
2. Find instructional videos (YouTube has some) on how to do the move
3. The first few times you do the new moves have someone else watch you to see if what you are doing looks like how Lauren is doing it. Eventually you will be able to ""feel"" when you do it right but in the beginning having someone else there to tell you if you are off is important.",1367971200,5,1467,4.350364963503649
3801647,5,B001UIDREM,This video is great for pregnancy and is great because the hubby can work out with you too with heavier weights. I definitely recommend it!,1367712000,,139,4.6
3801648,3,B001UIDREM,"It's not as intense as I had hoped, i'm in my third trimester and used to do kettlebells regularly before I got pregnant. I was craving some more weight based work outs, and thought this would be perfect. I like some of the exercises a lot, and they are appropriate for a big belly - which my other kettlebell DVDs didn't accomodate.",1364774400,,333,4.387096774193548
3801649,5,B001UIDREM,I'm a runner who incorporates kettlebells for the great strength and cardio they provide. At 4 1/2 months pregnant I can't run as much as I used to though and was afraid to use some of my other kettlebell videos as they do moves not safe during your 2nd and 3rd trimester. This one however is amazing!! I even got my husband to do it with me once and he was sore the next day. It's long enough to give you a full body workout too if you don't want to do anything else with it.,1363219200,,476,3.96875
3801650,5,B001UIDREM,"I am not pregnant but felt this DVD still provided a great workout, got my heart rate up.  I have Lauren's first DVD Ultimate Sculpt and Condition Volume 1 and was ready to try something new but I was not ready for Volume 2 so I decided to give this DVD a try and I am so glad I did.  I plan on alternating between baby bells and volume 1.  I love the way I feel when I workout with kettlebells and Lauren is a great instructor.",1362268800,,428,3.896551724137931
3801651,5,B001UIDREM,"Before purchasing this DVD I was a huge kettlebell fanatic, doing more high intensity sets. When I found out I was pregnant I was so disappointed from a fitness perspective as I didn't know how I should/could modify my workouts and my doctor suggested keeping my heart rate around roughly 165-170. I had stopped running maybe a month or so before getting pregnant so I knew I couldn't just jump back into that. Finding this DVD made me absolutely ecstatic. Lauren makes sure to show proper form at angles in which you're able to ensure that you're doing the workout correctly, which is super important with kettlebells in general, even more so with pregnancy. The workout is sure to get your heart rate up, but not too high. It will also give you the opportunity to begin strength training, or improve what you've got due to the pace of the workout. My husband even joins me in this work out when he's working to increase weights!

I will agree that the production is not as high quality as other DVDs compared to the price, but I enjoy this too much for that to be a factor. I also wouldn't necessarily recommend this to someone who has never worked with a kettlebell before as she does not verbally review basic form (aside from what you see) which may not benefit some new to this type of workout.",1356220800,,1300,4.508474576271187
3801652,3,B001UIDREM,"I expected Lauren Brooks to be a more dynamic instructor.  Her delivery is bland and monotone.

The workout segments are appropriate for pregnancy.  However, there is not much instruction; the assumption is that you not only have the ability to exercise, but also that you are familiar with kettlebells.",1355184000,,303,5.142857142857143
3801653,4,B001UIDREM,"This is more of a using the kettlebell as weights instead of a kettlebell work out. If that makes sense. I use the Art of Strength dvd when I want a good kettlebell workout. However, I think when you're pregnant it might be better to use an easier dvd. I can understand that throwing around a heavy cast iron bell while pregnant isn't so safe. She has you do a lot of stationary bell lifting. For example doing a squat while holding the bell. You can use a regular weight just as well with this dvd. It's a good way to stay in shape, but don't expect to use a kettlebell to it's full capacity in this dvd. She only does a couple of trademark kettlebell moves. I think this is safe when you're pregnant.",1348876800,,702,4.207407407407407
3801654,5,B001UIDREM,"This video is perfect, im 5months pregnant, I liked that I was able to keep up with it but its still a workout. It gives u the right amount of exercise at the right pace.",1343347200,,170,3.8857142857142857
3801655,5,B001UIDREM,"I've used Lauren Brooks' Baby Bells workout for the past month and love it! I had started using kettlebells last summer and was worried that I would have to abandon them for some ho-hum workout once I got pregnant. Luckily, I stumbled on this DVD on Amazon while looking for a workout and I'm very happy. It's challenging without being overkill, and Lauren was 6 1/2 months pregnant while shooting the DVD, so it was nice to see that it could be done.

The DVD is broken down into warmup, workout, and cool-down. The workout section has three ""rounds"" of exercises (3-5 exercises per round that are repeated twice). Not all of the exercises involve a kettlebell/weight (e.g., side planks, pushups), and she gives the option of using dumbbells for people who may not have used kettlebells. Lauren also shows modifications for each of the exercises so that women who've never used kettlebells or prefer to not use weights at all can do them.

Highly recommend it!",1338076800,2,961,4.748502994011976
3801656,5,B001UIDREM,"I am six months pregnant, and wanted a dvd basically to keep strong during my pregnancy, and bought this one and Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne Steben, which both fit the bill perfectly and were exactly what I was after.  I'm a pretty fit and active person, some would say very fit and active;), and in my other pregnancies I was afraid to do too much so basically just walked through my pregnancies. I was in my early twenties when I had my first two children, so it wasn't so much of a problem bouncing back. But with my third pregnancy a couple of years ago I found it harder losing the weight and getting fit and strong again after my pregnancy, and now at 40 expecting my fourth baby, I wanted to keep up some sort of strengthening programme during my pregnancy aside from walking and swimming, but which felt safe as well.  I am relatively new to kettlebells. I had just started trying them out a couple of months before my pregnancy, so wasn't sure if it was something I should continue through my pregnancy, so am rapt to have this dvd, and know that I am doing a safe workout with the kettlebells.  Lauren is a great instructor, and easy to follow, and I like that there is no unnecessary chatter, and just good direct instructions along the way.  I also bought her dvd The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells Vol 1, and look forward to trying that out when I start into a programme after baby is born. Thoroughly recommend this for other pregnant ladies, if you are relatively fit and strong to begin with (not for beginners).  I am passing this dvd onto my mum when I'm finished, as she is new to kettlebells, and I know she will enjoy it as a nice easy introduction to kettlebell training.",1311724800,2,1725,4.44620253164557
8343916,2,B001UIDREM,"If you're in your first trimester and you actually worked out before you became pregnant...youre going to think that it doesnt challenge you enough. Im six weeks. Before I was pregnant I did Michelle Khais kettlenettics every other day , and ran 30 minutes at a speed of 7.2 on my treadmill (5 days a week), and then afterwards would hike for 4 miles ( most days) For me this dvd just feels like a stretch session...too low impact for my tastes, didn't feel like it did anything to tone me up.

8343920,5,B001UIDREM,I am in my first trimester and have been doing KB for a year now.  This is a challenging workout!  I can't lift the same weight that I could before pregnancy so I know being preg has a lot to do with this feeling tough.  She does a long warm-up and a thorough workout with cool down.  I have 3 of her DVDs and they never get boring and a lot of fun.  I feel that you can either challenge yourself with her or take it easy.,1465603200,,422,3.8045977011494254

8343922,3,B001UIDREM,"I started doing this workout at 4 months post-partum, so I can't speak to its effectiveness as a pregnancy workout. As a weight-training workout, it is INTENSE! I saw almost immediate results when I started doing it two or three times per week. I use a 25 lb. kettlebell, and now that I've been doing it for about three months, there is still one exercise that I just can't do (Clean and Press). The exercises seem ingeniously arranged to get the maximum workout out of you without tiring you to exhaustion. I like the pacing; some workout videos (Jillian) seem to move so fast from one exercise to another that it's a struggle to get the form right (if, like me, you're not a terribly coordinated person).

However, I have two major problems with this DVD. The production values are not great--the video is grainy and the music is low-budget synthesized elevator music. These issues would not bother me with such an excellent no-frills workout. But the fact that you can't skip to the next exercise or even the next section of the workout makes no sense. Every attempt to move to another part of the workout (even the cool down) just starts the whole workout over again. There are no chapters; it might as well be a VHS tape for the ease of use.

Besides the technological problems, the instructor, who is about 8 months pregnant, is wearing a two-piece outfit that is little more than a bikini. I have seven children and know that pregnancy is a beautiful thing in itself, but I don't think a naked pregnant body is very pleasant to look at, no matter how buff it is. Paradoxically, because the instructor has so much exposed skin on screen, I don't feel comfortable doing this workout when my sons are around, which dramatically reduces my opportunities to exercise. I wish Lauren Brooks would put together a workout like this with scene selection capabilities, and an instructor wearing a normal workout t-shirt and shorts.",1454630400,,1927,4.6982248520710055
8343923,5,B001UIDREM,"I'm about 18 weeks pregnant and needed to get back to a regular exercise routine after being sick for the first four months. I have some experience with kettle bells but was afraid to jump in after reading the reviews and looking at the price. To my surprise, this workout is fabulous! It's challenging but doable--I was able to complete the entire workout following some of the modifications and look forward to being able to build up to the full workout very soon. Awesome workout. :)",1448323200,,486,4.662790697674419
8343924,5,B001UIDREM,"I loved this workout, kept me fit during my pregnancy. Between this and 4 mile walks 6x a week I only gained 38 lbs and had a really healthy baby at almost 8lbs / 20"" and he was 2 weeks early. The weight came off fairly easy after giving birth, I think I would attribute this to keeping up with fitness while carrying my son. First 20lbs were gone in 4 months, and the next 18 lbs were gone by the time I was three months post partum. Stomach is fairly tight too and I will also say I am short and being small takes work for me so I thought losing the baby weight would be tough and I think this made it easier. I will say however, the production, sound quality, etc isn't the best and this does get boring after a while.",1437696000,,721,3.9793103448275864
