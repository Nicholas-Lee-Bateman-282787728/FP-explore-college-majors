567230,5,6303042473,"I had this video years ago but didn't keep it.  I decided to get it again adn revisit it.  I am an intermediate exerciser who primarily uses The Firm.  I was pleasantly surprised by this routine, it's a good strength workout!

Susan is joined by her friends, all shapes and sizes ready to pump iron.  You start out with a simple warmup, lots of step touches, hamstring curls, knee lifts, etc. along with arm movements.  Then it's time for strength training, you will do 3 sets of 10 reps for most of the exercises, a couple you will only do 2 sets.  All of the exercises are performed in a 2-2 count.  Susan and friends use one set of dumbells which appear to weigh anywhere from 1-5 pounds, one of the exercisers doesn't use weights at all.

The lower body is worked first with squats, these are done unweighted, but I add weights to make it a little more challenging.  Next you will sit in a chair or on a bench and do seated leg extensions, then you will stand again and do hamstring curls and rear leg extensions while holding onto a chair for balance.  Most of the exercisers use ankle weights for these, but it's not required.  A stretch follows this sequence of exercises before moving on to the upper body.

I liked the upper body portion the best, and for those more advanced like myself, use heavier weights and you will definitely feel it.  It is pretty straightforward, you will work one muscle group at a time, starting with shoulders with military presses and upright rows, 3 sets of each alternating the militaries and rows.  Then you move on to back with rear deltoid raises, I myself do 2 sets of these and 1 set of double arm rows to change it up a bit.  Next is chest, you will move to the floor and do bench presses followed by pec flies.  Then you will stand up for bicep curls, I also modify this section by doing 2 sets of traditional curls and 1 set of hammer curls.  Finally you will work the triceps with kickbacks, then you will move to the floor for a relaxation segment.  There really isn't a final stretch but you stretch after each series of exercises.

Susan does a good job in this video, she shows modifications for some of the exercises, constantly reminds you to breathe and modify if necessary, and to use good form on all the exercises.  She is friendly and encouraging throughout the whole video.  I would recommmend this to anyone, it would be better suited for beginner/intermediate levels but advanced would also get a good workout by using heavier weights.  Try it you might be surprised like I was.",1124409600,24,2542,4.454545454545454
567231,5,6303042473,"I forgot to write in my nov. review, that i also brought her book called ""Food"", which i found to be very helpful. i am trying steps in chapter 2, i don't know if i'll get up to chapter 3 steps soon. I hope Susan  keeps writing and making more videos, she is a true lady that has had to  learn from Food mistakes , like the rest of us.",947030400,8,335,3.7714285714285714

7838422,5,6303042473,"This is one of my favorite exercise videos.  Susan keeps you on target.  She tells you exactly how to do the exercise, corrects the people and I feel corrected.  When you are exercising with a tape it is really wonderful when the director reminds you and reminds you of how to do it corrected, and how to modify if it is too difficult.  I don't like any of the new Powter's videos as the editor did not know music and most of them are spliced wrong.  I used this video in my 40's, 50's, 60's and now I'm in my 70's and I'm still lovin all the old videos I've found and of course purchased.  I've had to modify this one a little because of physical problems, but I'm getting my strength back and I love it.  This is the third time I've had to purchase this video as I've ruined the others.  What can I say, I love it.",1370908800,,816,4.05625
7838423,3,6303042473,"I remember her from the 90's as the ""Stop the Insanity!"" lady. I thought her workout would be interesting. Well - not really. She does all exercises exactly the same - 3 sets of 10 in 2 counts. Every exercise is done like that. And she talks non stop, which is ok but she says the same things over and over and over. She does upper body and legs but not one ab exercise. I was disappointed and I won't be keeping this one. But it might be good for someone just starting out?!?",1342051200,,476,4.074468085106383
7838424,5,6303042473,"This is my core (& has been for many years) resistance or weight lifting routine. It is easy to follow, you can mix it up the way you want by using different weights for different exercises, after a while, you can cut the sound down on the tape, and play music or listen to talk radio while you work out. This tape and its routine will give you the best results in the quickest of time if you do it AFTER you do one of her fat burning aerobic tapes. Three times a week or every other day, add this in after your cardio, fat burning, or aerobic exercises have been done.  If you want long skinny arms stick to 2 pound weights, if you want more muscle tone, go 3 pounds or higher. You can also add weight while you do her aerobic exercises on her aerobic tapes.",1294963200,3,759,4.093959731543624
