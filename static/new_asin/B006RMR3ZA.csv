5015013,5,B006RMR3ZA,"The book and DVD are very well done, the training steps are simple and clear. I needed to have something to refer to when I go to the range. I usually end up simply shooting bulls eye, and that is good, but soon becomes old news. I shoot IDPA and found this program very intuitive and helpful. This is very reasonably priced and worth every penny!!

Happy shooting!",1350259200,,365,4.367647058823529
5015014,4,B006RMR3ZA,"The video is very well produced and shot in HD.  I have Mike's Competition Handgun Training Program book and it does a great job of describing each drill in detail so the reader has a very clear understanding of the purpose, form and goals of each drill.  With that said, watching Mike perform each drill in the DVD adds an extra layer of detail and clarity just not possible from reading the exercise descriptions.

The video goes thru each of the Micro drills.  After watching the video, I was able to better understand the mechanics of each drill and corrected several mistakes I was making.

My biggest benefit was hearing and watching Mike describe how to properly manage recoil by locking the wrist tendons and applying proper grip.  You can read about how to do this, but like they say a picture (video) is worth a thousand words.

I highly recommend this DVD if you are trying to become a better shooter and/or practical shooter.

Pros:
- Wealth of information and very well documented drills
- Great video quality
- Each demonstration is explained and demonstrated in great detail

Cons:
- Expensive $29 dollars for each DVD, although if you use Amazon On-Demand you can rent for 7 days for $2 bucks
- Audio quality, they shot the video on a very windy day and there is a lot of wind noise that slightly muffles the dialog.  It makes easily hearing the instructions very difficult at times.  I had to knock it down a star due to this.
- For the price of the DVD, the audio quality should be much better.",1343174400,6,1512,4.522058823529412

8503601,1,B006RMR3ZA,"Very boring and not a likable instructor, also the instruction is entery level. I'd recommend Saul Kirsch for IPSC instruction his DVD set is far superior.",1479772800,,155,5.0

8503603,2,B006RMR3ZA,Verry boring and he keeps pitching the handbook so I'm guessing without it you'd be kinda lost like me,1454803200,,102,4.421052631578948

8503607,5,B006RMR3ZA,"This DVD really complements the book. A picture says everything. The talking intro is a little long, but I understand now why it is.  Michael is a good instructor and love to do a clinic with him.",1396656000,,196,4.297297297297297
8503608,5,B006RMR3ZA,"If you shoot IPSC or IDPA and want to move up in class, this is the set of instructional manuals you need. I bought both books and both DVD's. In about six months I moved up from having been an IDPA sharpshooter and USPSA/IPSC C class shooter for years to Expert in three IDPA divisions and B class in USPSA Limited division. The DVD's are less of a necessity than the books if your budget is tight. But they do illustrate things well and might clear some points that less experienced shooters wouldn't get just from reading the book.",1385596800,,534,4.404040404040404
8503609,1,B006RMR3ZA,"I bought this expecting to see some of what I thought would be in there. Most of the methods I'm unable to do due to money and they type of job I have. Unless you have tons of money to spend ALL the time, I suggest getting another book for help in improvement in competition.",1364256000,,275,4.0181818181818185
