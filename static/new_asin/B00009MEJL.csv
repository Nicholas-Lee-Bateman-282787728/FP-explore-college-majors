1884596,5,B00009MEJL,"While watching the 2001 release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Believer/dp/B00049QQJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Believer</a>, it recalled to mind THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH. Though I haven't viewed the latter movie in over a decade, the power of Maximilian Schell's performance puts it on my list of ""Most Memorable Films"", though perhaps my memory of the details is fuzzy.

Schell is Arthur Goldman, a wealthy Jewish industrialist living in a Manhattan highrise apartment. Goldman is apparently a recluse, who deals with the world through his personal assistant, Charlie (Lawrence Pressman). At first, Arthur seems like a regular guy, albeit expressing outrageous views on Jews and Judaism, but it becomes apparent to the audience that the man has serious issues when he's seen burning the skin under his upper arm with a candle flame. Then, the audience and Charlie are dumbfounded when an Israeli hit team breaks in, kidnaps Goldman, and carries him off to trial in Israel as a war criminal - a former Nazi concentration camp commandant, Adolph Dorf. Goldman insists pretrial that he be allowed to wear a full SS uniform. For his own protection, then, he faces his accusers as THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH. Bullet-proof glass, that is, considering the emotional volatility of the charges to camp survivors that are present.
Schell received Oscar and Golden Globe Best Actor nominations for his depiction of a man so tortured by guilt that he would go to extremes to exorcise it. Personal guilt for having survived the Holocaust; collective Jewish guilt for not having fought back. Taking on the persona of Dorf, Goldman gleefully mocks the Jews for their meekness as they went to slaughter. The sad end to the trial is one of the most emotionally compelling scenes I've ever watched.

THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH was one of the first VHS tapes I purchased back in 1979 when I bought my first video recorder. (Both the tape and the recorder were MUCH more expensive back then!) Do yourself a favor and rent this film (along with THE BELIEVER) for a thought-provoking double feature on the psyche-twisting nature of guilt.",1066521600,47,2173,5.2057142857142855
1884597,5,B00009MEJL,"OK, Jack Nicholson did a nice little job in Cuckoo's Nest---his usual scenery munching, overdone performance. However, if fairness truly prevailed in 1975 and Max Schell was a cozy denizen of mainstream Hollywood, he would have taken the Oscar hands down for this remarkable and powerful tour de force of acting brilliance. Arthur Hiller crafts a minimalist piece of cinematography that features acting---not moviemaking gimmickry. This film is a true sleeper which seems to finally and deservedly be waking up 28 years after its creation.",1060387200,7,539,5.352941176470588

Don't make the mistake of passing this gem up because you've already seen so many other 'holocaust' films. Max Schell is superb as our main character. Great dialogue.  Robert Shaw writing? Who knew?

1884666,5,B00009MEJL,"MAXIMILLIAN SCHELL carried this difficult performance to a great and polished end--

[There were 11-16 million people killed during this wave of atrocity known as THE HOLOCAUST in Germany.  In part, an estimate of six million were logged in history as the potential GENOCIDE OF THE JEWS in Germany during this holocaust.  I consider all these acts and events as part of a LIVING HELL in Germany and elsewhere: just like the periods of LIVING HELLS that occurred in the founding and birth of America.  Such atrocious behaviors occurred then too producing living hells: the GENOCIDE OF THE NATIVES & the BONDAGE & ENSLAVEMENT of STOLEN AFRICANS (and we should not forget the treatment of women) and all that became part of a ""blended"" nation of AMERICANS...therefore, Americans end up enslaving Americans for periods in our history and that is all quantifiably: events and periods of living hells. We should all work together on the planet to understand these ""specie events"" and realize that they are Periods of Living Hells, periods of atrocity, periods and events of inhumanity.(On the ""devil"" side.) Apparently all ""worlds"" will have these events in their history, hopefully: primatively.(That's the dream. That's the divine dream.) Hopefully, we as a specie can find modern ways to curb these ""inhumane atrocious conditions"".

  Now we can know when we are in a ""living heaven""; it's when we are not performing a ''living hell''. [That's not right!]  Part of the population in Germany held to ""humanity"": less contaminated in their minds, body, and spirit: while part of the population in Germany lived ""inhumanity"" on a daily basis for years.  Part of the population in America lived the hopes and dreams of a new nation, a new ""humanity"", while other parts of the population lived ""inhumanity"" as a daily course for centuries, ongoing.  It is all energy and we can't hold it forever in any formation.  That is the biggest part of the problem.  We can't hold to just ""heavenly values"" forever.  We, as a specie, do go, even, must go...through events and periods of hells.  We say it is the ""human condition"".  We say it is LIFE as we know it and have to live it.  SCHELL's performance put this whole bit on a platter and serve it to us. -----MO",1424217600,,2248,4.860892388451443

1884696,5,B00009MEJL,"Whether playing a dramatic, semi-comedic or really rotten person role,  Max Schell was always at the top of his game.  My husband and I had the distinct pleasure of meeting and conversing personally with him at a book signing in Darmstadt Germany in 1997 where he read excerpts from and commented on his autobiographical book ""Das Rebell"" (The Rebel).  He also answered audience questions regarding some of his acting roles, his life in general and about his sister Maria who had such a tragic life and ending.  His answers or comments were loaded with both direct to the point personal comments and feelings as well as really funny and entertaining ones.  When speaking of his sister he became quite nostalgic but didn't dwell on his sadness about her.  He was a soft spoken man seemingly quite humble at times and extremely friendly.  He was surprised that there were several of us Americans in the audience since both the book and the entire presentation is/was in German.  (Was not a problem for us, both being fluent in the language).  After he found out there were Americans in the audience, he graciously took the time to translate a lot of his spoken word for their enjoyment as well.  He seemed to prefer these smaller type audiences, there were about 100 people semi-circled around him, so the setting felt quite intimate.  During the subsequent book signing, he took extra time when one of us Americans came forward for him to sign our books and wrote a personal note to each of us, by name, before signing our books.  He mentioned to us how grateful he was to his American audiences for fostering his career throughout the years.  I must say that even in 1997 the vestiges of age and declining health were becoming quite obvious.  It was with sadness when I read of his passing.  However, as with all of our truly great stars, they will be with us as long as their films exist.  As for this film, his role is one of the rotten characters that you love to hate.  We first see him as millionaire Jewish entrepreneur Arthur Goldman living in a Manhattan penthouse where he disses on everything from baseball, the Papacy, ex-wives to his family's extermination at the hands of the Nazis.  After he is arrested by Israeli agents and charged with being one of those self-same Nazis, we see him begin to morph into the sociopath character of Adolph Dorf, Commandant of the concentration camp where his family was allegedly exterminated.  No more spoilers.  This is a tense, on the edge of your seat type of movie almost from the git-go.  If you like these types of movies, you'll love ""The Man In The Glass Booth"".",1419724800,6,2619,4.662309368191721

1884727,3,B00009MEJL,"Many frustrated filmgoers fondly remembered Maximilian Schell's performance in Arthur Hiller's ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" for many years.  Year after year, they would list the film as one they would like to see as a DVD.  When the disc was finally released, it had been mercilessly edited, changing the subtext of much of the story.

It shouldn't be surprising; the adaptation was controversial when it first appeared as a made-for-TV-movie in 1972.  The author of the play on which it was based, actor Robert Shaw, disowned Hiller's version.  Shaw's play deals with the concept of ""survivor's guilt.""  The protagonist, Mr. Goldman, sets himself up for trial as a NAZI war criminal due to this guilt.  The TV adaptation had an additional layer however; this version of Goldman taunts his fellow Jews, often exposing signs of moral inconsistency or even hypocrisy.

The latter caused a firestorm of controversy when the film debuted.  Moreover, it also angered many Jews that Goldman was played by Maximilian Schell - best remembered as the defense attorney for NAZI war criminals in ""Judgment At Nuremburg.""  An Austrian Catholic known for playing an advocate for NAZIs was considered unworthy to play this part.

The DVD release avoids the controversy by omitting Goldman/Schell's most cutting remarks, as well as the prosecutor's lines which betray her hypocrisy.  Moreover, the character's death rite is changed from the English ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" to a Hebrew recitation.  This change reaffirms Goldman's Jewishness - a familiar change to those who have read the Gospel accounts of Christ's death. The late Robert Shaw might have approved of this heavily edited version, but it eviscerates the TV version so completely that it loses all of its integrity as an independent piece of work.",1406678400,2,1817,5.097972972972973

1884730,4,B00009MEJL,"First and foremost, this is one of the best ""Films that feels like a stage play"" ever made. One of the most profound, philosophically challenging films of its time, ""Man in the Glass Booth"" is as much a challenge to the Cold War-era Europe as ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" was to WW2-era Germany. With the exception of the first 30-40 minutes, which, though brilliantly acted by Maximilian Schell, do rather drag on, the film is an intense examination of nationalism, ideology, and an examination of the grief associated with a period as horrifying as the holocaust.

If you want a truly unique experience, ""Man in the Glass Booth"" is a challenging insight in to a staggeringly unique place and time in human history. Personally, I think it pairs fantastically with Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" and another Schell masterpiece, the aforementioned ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" for a wonderful, atypical WW2 perspective.",1395705600,3,916,5.147651006711409

1884777,5,B00009MEJL,"Like others here have said, I, also, vividly recall seeing this remarkable film in its original theatrical release, and how I left the theater absolutely stunned and moved by the power of both the story and, most especially, Maximillian Schell's astonishing, electrifying, mesmerizing tour de force. Truly, no superlatives adequately convey the virtuoso acting brilliance which Schell displays in this marvelously complex and enigmatic role, by turns slyly witty and chillingly monstrous. I can safely say this is one of the great male screen performances of all time, right up there with the best of Brando, Steiger, Hoffman, Duvaal, Deniro, Pacino and others in that rarified league, including Nicholson, who happened to win the Oscar for 'Cuckoo's Nest' in the same year Schell was nominated for 'Booth'. And while 'Cuckoo's Nest' is clearly the finer work of cinema, 'The Man In The Glass Booth' is nonetheless directed with fluid assurance by Arthur Hiller, though its theatrical origins - it was based on both a novel and play by the multi-talented Robert Shaw - are clearly evident here. Yet even that is quibbling in the face of the raw, cumulative power of Hiller's film adaptation. Also, the screenwriter, Edward Anhalt, had taken liberties with Shaw's original text, prompting him to remove his name from the credits. Though, apparently, once he saw the finished film, he experienced a change of heart. And it's easy to see why, for, despite what is lost, to some degree, by Anhalt's omissions and alterations, those are largely made up for in other ways, with clever additions and, most particularly, by the reimagined ending which is devastating and unforgettable and, in my opinion, both more cinematically satisfying and thematically appropriate than that of either the novel or play. But all of that aside, 'Glass Booth' should be seen knowing as little about the plot as possible, for it is not only a shattering psychological drama, but a metaphysical mystery play as well, and the less you know about its story the better. Just SEE it. It's one of the most fascinating and penetrating studies of the nature of guilt you are likely to see, and, ultimately, a modern parable of the noble and terrible potential of the human mind and heart.",1375315200,3,2256,5.03475935828877
1884778,5,B00009MEJL,"Or, at least in my life, the greatest movie experience I ever had.  In my smug presumptions, I sat through the first half semi-bored, and then when Goldman said, he would defend himself as a Nazi--not as other Nazis (Eichmann) saying ""I was only following orders""--but rather saying, I followed Hitler because he was loveable and because he was right, I knew I had to sit up on my seat and listen with rapt attention.  What a brain twister.  No longer could I dismiss Nazis as inhuman monsters with no connection to me or other humans, but was able to see how they could appeal to very desperate, intelligent people.  So much more intellectually honest than the typical good guys, bad guys treatment. That's only the first of many psychological and plot twists. You can never quite guess where this tale will go. The novel and original play written by non-other than actor Robert Shaw (Man for all Seasons, Jaws, The Sting) are even better, but this film version does justice to the original and is only slightly less effective (although Shaw didn't like it). One of the films you must view before you die (I'd put it in the top ten!)  Beware, it is a stage play like Man for All Season, Doubt, Inherit the Wind, or Twelve Angry Men, so there is a lot of talking, no special effects, but the talking is amazing!",1373414400,,1311,4.538135593220339
1884779,5,B00009MEJL,"There are some who don't like this movie.

That is understandable.  It is a frightening movie.  It demonstrates that the killers and the victims are the same species, differentiated only by circumstances.

We like to think well of ourselves, so we divide the world into monsters and martyrs, heroes and villains, and never, ever, admit that we can and will, under social pressure, play either part with equal ease, though not both at once, as Dorf/Goldman finds.

It is the human race in that glass booth, just as it is the human race behind the bars of Charenton in ""Marat/Sade"".",1360281600,4,580,4.76
1884780,1,B00009MEJL,"This movie is just ridiculous.  Both as the supposed surviver of a concentration camp and the evil Colonol Dorf, Schell's character is just buffoonish and absurd.  Every remark is a Marx-brothers type joke.  Half his comments are about sex or the number of orgasms he gave his wife.  What all this has to do with deeper questions of identity, guilt, or anything else is impossible to say.  The ""prosecutor"" in the case makes little speeches that would be unsophisticated coming from a 6th grader.  Her opening statement (in an Israeli court) is that the Roman Catholic Church has a canon law which refers to certain (here she checks a paper to get it right) ""moral"" laws which supersede human laws and this is (sort of) the basis for the legality of abducting Dorf. It goes downhill from there.  Meanwhile Dorf sits in a glass booth grinning like a monkey and shouting out ""witticisms"" most of which are just stupid. The whole thing is frankly dumb and embarassing to watch.  Maybe this passed for incisive art in 1975 but I doubt it.",1357344000,3,1034,4.6740331491712706
1884781,5,B00009MEJL,"This film was somewhat shocking for me when I first saw it in 1975.  In those days movie reviews did not generally appear on TV and there was, of course, no internet.  In my bare dorm room I did not have a TV anyway, and the campus newspaper did not often review movies.  When I stepped into the theater, I entered with the understanding that this movie was inspired to some degree by the 1960's trial in Israel of the infamous Nazi grand executioner Adolf Eichmann.  I had not anticipated at all that this movie would be hilarious as well as troubling!  Maximilian Schell's character Arthur Goldman treats the viewer to his many wry observations, with the other characters often contributing with their own verbal gems.  Much of the fun revolves around the question of the actual identity of supposed Holocaust survivor Goldman.  One of his favorite quips addresses the question as to whether Goldman's Jewish late wife had ever developed any insight into Goldman's actual identity.  ""All she knew was that I was rich and not impotent,"" remarked Goldman.  Goldman goes on to attempt to distance himself from the perception that he is, in fact, Jewish, by indulging in numerous over-the-top anti-Semitic diatribes--only to have his efforts downplayed by his young Jewish aid who counters with the ironic jab that ""only a Jew could be that anti-Semitic!""",1335657600,3,1353,4.899122807017544
1884782,5,B00009MEJL,"""The Man in the Glass Booth"" (1975) is a great adaption of theater to film. Robert Shaw played the part of Arthur Goldman in the theater. The DVD Also has extras on The American Film Theatre. This presentation has many great actors. I was surprised to see second billing going to Lois Nettleton.

Arthur Goldman (Maximilian Schell) rich eccentric Jewish businessman who is actually schizophrenic tells his assistant Charlie Cohn (Lawrence Pressman) and doctor that he is being stalked. At first they do not believe him. Soon they realize that he is being stalked.

Soon we find that Goldman was not paranoid and was whisked away to Israel and tried as a war criminal named Dorf. Dorf confesses to everything and says by the time the tile is over he will have one.

We follow the trial step by step with the interactions between Dorf and the prosecutor Miriam Rosen (Lois Nettleton.) did anyone really win and what did we come away with?",1321574400,,936,4.730061349693251
1884783,5,B00009MEJL,"As I began watching this movie I was a little put off by the grainy quality of the picture.  Then as the movie progressed,  it gave me the impression of an old cheezy 70s film.

He takes his audience on a real roller Coaster ride, that has an ending like no other film I have ever seen.  I normally do not watch movies about the Holocaust, but believe that everyone should see this movie.  The book should be on every University reading list.

1884840,5,B00009MEJL,"The American Film Theater created many magnificent plays on film, for a select audience. It was a low-budget effort, for most of them, but ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" had appeared often enough in the right places to make it eligible for Oscar recognition. Indeed, this remarkable, talky play had slightly higher values, as well as the spot-on, reliable direction of Arthur Hiller (The Miracle Worker), and an unflinching, magnificent performance from Maximillian Schell. Certainly, it's hard to get a grasp on this character, and after a while you just think he's an eccentric nut-case. I don't want to give away too much (I never saw it before I rented it), but suffice it to say that there has rarely been a display of power and crazy; and, later, grief, despair and vulnerability and personal redemption. It all relies on Mr. Schell, a centered performance of total conviction. Play author Robert Shaw, best known for ""Jaws"", but a well-seasoned actor in his own right, was against the filming of his play. After seeing the result, he put his name back in the credits. I was pleased to see such creative ability captured on film. Max's surprise Oscar win in 1961 (Judgment at Nuremberg) was not a fluke (later nommed for ""Julia"" in 1977). His loss in '75 to Nicholson in ""Cuckoo's Nest"" could be debated (it was his turn to win), but the Oscar nom was enough to make me want to see it, and maybe others will feel the same. Maximillian Schell's performance here is what may be considered a ""tour de force"", and, in this case, I think it truly applies. Bravo to all! Let's not forget the thoughtful presence of Lawrence Pressman, another reason to cherish this piece.",1247097600,8,1669,4.719178082191781

1884842,4,B00009MEJL,"The film begins on the balcony of a luxurious penthouse apartment in New York City overlooking Central Park. An obviously wealthy, Jewish businessman, Arthur Goldman (Schell) is pontificating about seemingly random subjects to his loyal assistants. At first, he seems just eccentric but then you being to question his sanity. The line between sanity and eccentricity blurs even further as he sees his father (murdered in Auschwitz) working a food cart on the street below and as he begins to act paranoid over a blue Mercedes he believes is watching his apartment. Then, suddenly, two men (Israeli agents) break into his apartment and arrest/abduct him for being Adolph Dorf, the SS Colonel in charge of the concentration camp where Goldman's parents were killed. The scene moves to a jail cell in Jerusalem where the prosecutor fills Goldman/Dorf in on the charges and where he announces he will defend himself. The trial begins and Goldman/Dorf is put in a soundproof, bulletproof booth for his protection. I won't tell any more of the story but hang in there during the first half hour because here's where the story really gets interesting and Schell puts on a powerful performance worthy of his Oscar nomination. Who really is Goldman/Dorf. Is he the killer the Israelis believe or have they made a tragic mistake? What is the mental state of someone who has survived the holocaust while their family has been exterminated? Can the real truth be known? Originally, this was a stage play, and was adapted for the big screen as part of a project to bring the theater to the masses. It will leave you thinking much more deeply about the holocaust experience of the Jewish people. Not a light film by any means but worthwhile watching. [...]",1211760000,2,1742,4.908474576271186
1884843,5,B00009MEJL,I saw this movie when it first appeared in Australia around 1975 and it has lost nothing of its excitement and magic. Maximilian Schell's performance is outstanding - I cannot understand why he didn't win an Oscar for it. All of the American Film Theatre productions are of a standard to which other movie-makers should aspire. This is highly recommended. I shall be purchasing others in the series.,1187827200,,399,4.882352941176471

1884845,5,B00009MEJL,"I had no idea that this film is finally available, and I'm delighted.  I'll buy it at once.  I saw it in its debut showing -- where i was living at that time (1975) while I was in college, and found it extraordinarily moving.  I'm an appreciator of Maxillian Schell and found him at the top of his form in this film.  In fact, I've searched for this film (call me crazy) every 3 or 4 years for the last 32 years in video rental stores, stores selling videos, and then where DVDs are sold.  So I'm stunned it is finally out.  That year (1975) the other standout film in the American Film Theatre production series (to which I had a subscription) was an avant guarde film that became a bit of a cult classic, and couldn't be more different, ""The Maids.""",1167523200,3,751,4.253521126760563
1884846,5,B00009MEJL,"That Maximilian Schell's outstanding acting performance in ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" did not garner a deserved Oscar is only made understandable by the fact that Jack Nicholson was honored for his portrayal of McMurphy in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".  Schell was mesmerizing in his portrayal of bombastically eccentic and fabulously wealthy Jewish architect Arthur Goldman.  Ensconsed in a palatial and luxuriously appointed penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park, Schell is served by his dutiful adminstrative assistant Charlie Cohn played by Lawrence Pressman.

An astute businessman, Schell is plagued by images from his past which included internment in a concentration camp.  With Schell's flaky personality firmly established, the plot takes an unforseen twist.  Schell is abducted by Israeli agents who spirit him back to Israel to stand trial as a notorious Nazi war criminal.  Alleged to be Colonel Dorff, a monster responsible for murderous, heinous crimes against humanity, Schell plead his case acting in his own defense.

Based on a successful play written by talented and tempestuous actor Robert Shaw,  ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" forces us to confront the reality of the lives permanently altered by the horrors of the Holocaust.",1164326400,11,1261,5.430769230769231
1884847,5,B00009MEJL,"Yes, yes I know all the fulminations comparing this film to the play. I haven't seen the play nor read the novel, so I'm judging purely by the film, which I rate at the very highest. OF COURSE the movie is ""contrived"" as Leonard Maltin's movie guide has it, that's what fables do (talking wolves, trees that sing, clouds that weep and preach a moral), they present contrived situations in order to elucidate. This psycho-fable unearths the ghoulish byplay of fire and ice in all of us, Jew or Bosch, whichever side of the barbed wire of things you stand. Schell's acting is superlative, and the LANGUAGE is English at its nightmare-wittiest. To summarize: you can't like ""Doctor Strangelove"" and scorn this film: they're two sides of the same rifle butt.

1884848,5,B00009MEJL,"I was a teenager when these movies were first released. I remember them being different, with limited releases in very few theaters.  The first film I remember seeing was ""The Iceman Cometh"" - I was a big Lee Marvin fan. A great film, with a powerhouse cast. But if I had to choose one of newly restored DVD sets recently released of all 14 original films by THE AMERICAN FILM THEATRE, I would start with this one first. These movies had given me a new respect for filmaking at the time.....incredible actors in great roles, great directors reinventing ways to film stage plays, somehow making them not feel I was just watching a filmed play, and thereby reaching a much broader audience.
This set, with  five films, has some of my favorites. ""A Delicate Balance"" has been a film I can never forget, with the great Paul Scofield and Katherine Hepburn, and ""The Man in the Glass Booth"", ""In Celebration"", and ""The Homecoming"" all have performances by some of the greatest actors ever....it is truly a rare treat to see these films again. Seemingly lost for 30 years, I am so glad they have been ""rediscovered""! I would recommend these films highly.....they are the real deal! Set number one also has an incredible group of films. I believe all 14 films have also released as single DVD's, but these sets are the way to go.

1884849,5,B00009MEJL,"Thirty years ago, under the aegis of the ""American Film Theatre,"" Arthur Hiller directed a movie based on a novel by writer, director and actor Robert Shaw (famous for his performance in ""Jaws"" as the fisherman who came to a bad end in the mouth of a great white shark).  Whatever doubts one has about the plausibility of an enormously wealthy entrepreneur, whose schizophrenia tears him between the morally opposite identities of a sadistic concentration camp commandant, and a Jewish holocaust survivor, Maximilian Schell as ""The Man In the Glass Booth,"" gives a riviting and explosive performance.  The story is divided into two acts; the first half taking place in Arthur Goldman's luxurious Manhattan penthouse apartment, and the second half in an Israeli courtroom.  The final courtroom scene, when Goldman's true identity is revealed, is astonishing.",1070928000,25,857,5.286764705882353
7991536,5,B00009MEJL,"The Man in the Glass Booth is one of the films adapted from prominent plays as part of the early 1970s subscription series, The American Film Theatre. Based on Robert Shaws play and directed by Arthur Hiller (The Americanization of Emily, Silver Streak), the story concerns manic Jewish millionaire Arthur Goldman (Maximilian Schell), already teetering on the verge of insanity, who becomes diabolical when he is abducted from his Manhattan penthouse by Israeli agents and put on trial for war crimes committed while serving as a colonel in a Nazi concentration camp.

Testifying within a soundproof, bullet-proof glass enclosure, he unleashes a torrent of vitriol against his accusers, and exposes a secret that is both tragic and terrifying. The film, through Schells mesmerizing performance, explores the ongoing horrors of the Holocaust on one deeply troubled individual 30 years after the end of World War II. His performance is frequently theatrical, rather than cinematic, as he shouts, gestures, and overemphasizes his lines, yet is nonetheless enthralling because of Shaws dialogue and the riveting subject matter. With little variation in terms of locations, the movie has a decidedly stage-bound look, which may have been the purpose of executive producer Eli Landau. The plays the thing here, not cinematic pizzazz and fancy photography.

Bonus extras on the newly restored widescreen Blu-ray release include interviews with director Arthur Hiller and producer Ely Landau, a promotional film for The American Film Theatre, and a gallery of trailers for The American Film Theatre.
