7987731,5,B00008WI93,"When we get down to the basis of the Misty Mundae phenomenon,all her films come down to how much time is she on the screen ,how she looks,how well she acts and what amount of nudity is present. Included is the camera work that shows off Misty from the best angles and clarity. In short I have come to realize that Misty is the whole show .The other actresses may add significantly but the story lines are secondary.

In this film we get plenty of Misty looking at her very best. Misty has a weight problem and she can look a bit chubby in some of her films. In her recent TV productions she appears simply too fat. However this movie was made 9-10 years ago and she was at her physical peak for this one .The amount of nudity was rather short but it showed well. Very well. The camera work was excellent

Next we have her performance ,which can depend on the writer and director. In this one she has enough material to work with to give a sizzling performance. The actul story would be hard pressed to get a ""D"" in a HS english class as it makes little sense and is full of holes but the performance from Julian Wells and Misty shrug that off and turn out a superb result. Misty has plenty of screen time and gives one of her best performances. In fact Misty is on the screen all the time so we have the opportunity to appreciate all phases of her acting abitlty and beauty. She and Julian Wells always do a first rate job when paired together.

Misty's sister gives an adequate performance as the lessor sister. She bears little resemblance to her half sister and is over weight but she can act. She is fine in this one but her best acting job is her role in a short called The New York Wildcats. She is fat and homely but gives a great performance as the ""lady"" of a whore house.

All in all this is one of Misty's best efforts. Robert Marsiglia, the writer and director, seems to be able to bring out the best in Misty and he is at the helm in this one.",1310256000,6,1956,4.180371352785146
7987732,4,B00008WI93,"This movie is for fans who enjoyed Dr. Jekyll and Mistress Hyde.
Tony Marsiglia brings his style of writing and directing with a familiar cast of Misty Mundae, Julian Wells, and Andrea Davis. along with Chelsea Mundae. Misty's performance as the all around bad girl and cruel sister is one of her most memorable. Like DJ&MH there are some weird twists that leave you puzzled. This movie is refreshing for SC fans who want something outside of spoofs like Lord of the G-strings, and Play-mate of the apes.",1089763200,8,504,4.738636363636363
7987733,2,B00008WI93,"This movie was terrible. Misty & Chelsea don't really do anything at all. Let's face it, the only reason any guy buys or rents any of Misty Mundae's movies is just to see her running around in the nude actin silly. I like her body cause it's natural, like the long hair & the way she acts but thats it. If you're not a fan of Misty Mundae, don't waste your time.",1070323200,14,362,4.041666666666667
7987734,4,B00008WI93,"Don't let the cover art fool you, this isn't a movie about a couple gun-toting, hell-raising sisters. It's actually a very moody, deliberately-paced psychological thriller (with the expected erotic elements of course). Director Tony Marsiglia once again turns the conventional SC formula on its ear, bringing us a different style we're not used to seeing from the company. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed SIN SISTERS despite the fact that it's less like a b-movie and more serious in tone. Misty and Julian are both as intense as ever, both deliver what I consider to be their most dynamic performances so far. But in my view, the real gem in SIN SISTERS is Misty's real-life half sister Chelsea Mundae, who plays the other half of our title duo. I always remember her from her small role in VAMPIRE'S SEDUCTION, because she had a very original way of saying her lines, and had an expressive face. She didn't show up in anything else until this years' LORD OF THE G-STRINGS, in an extremely small role as a barmaid. Also, those who've watched the deleted scenes from Terry West's SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR LUST may recognize her from the opening love scene. Chelsea is awesome, and quickly became my favorite thing about SIN SISTERS. She's got a unique quality about her, can't quite put my finger on what it is. I just hope they start using her more. In my opinion, her performance was vital to the effectiveness and intensity of the film. Honestly, if I had to pick out any problem with the film, it's that Chelsea didn't do near as many nude scenes as the rest of the cast. That may have been her choice, or it may have been seen as more appropriate for the character, but I've only seen SC hold back when they think an actress may not be as appealing to their audiences. The only reason I say this is because in the little info booklet that came with SIN SISTERS, they seem to be afraid that SC audiences might find Chelsea to be older and bigger than their usual starlets, and thus turned off by her. Personally, I would like SC to continue casting women like Chelsea in their films, particularly in lead roles. She's an incredible actor, and great-looking as well. I don't think SC has anything to be concerned about!",1060128000,24,2214,4.621827411167513
