2155663,4,B00030ETYA,"I was at this concert and it was important to me to get this video on DVD. Video quality very poor. Way worse than a VHS tape. Audio is fine. If you're a Dylan (or Petty) fan, you'll probably overlook this and enjoy the show. It's a hard one to find. Read elsewhere that the video quality was similar to VHS-S. Not true. One of Dylans best concerts though, so if you're a fan, you'll probably like it.",1314489600,5,401,4.153846153846154

2155665,5,B00030ETYA,"When I saw this was from Brazil or whatever country in South America speaks Portuguese, bells went off, alarms sounded and that little voice in the back of my head said ""don't buy this, it's a cheap, shoddy rip-off.""  I had it on VHS and being unable to find an American release of the tour on DVD, decided to take a chance.  I was glad I did.  Quality-wise, its as good as the VHS tape and shows Dylan and Petty with the Heartbreakers as a superb back-up band in the days before the Traveling Wilburys had been dreamed of.  Was this tour perhaps the genesis of that legendary super-group?  Makes no difference, if you're a Dylan fan, this belongs in your collection.  If you're a Petty fan, it belongs in your collection.  Highlights include:  Like A Rolling Stone, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Just Like A Woman (one of Dylan's forgotten mid-'60's masterpieces) and others.  If you only buy one Dylan DVD, this should be the one.  Don't let the Portuguese scare you....it's not subtitled.",1102291200,21,988,4.626436781609195
2155666,5,B00030ETYA,"Bob Dylan performing with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on their 1986 tour. Great sound and well directed concert video filmed in Australia. Dylan is in top form as he delights his audience with a greatist hits show and the Heartbreakers produce a dynamic wall of sound sure to satisfy any fan.

Good set list including ""Knockin on Heavens Door"", ""Like a Rolling Stone"",""It Aint Me Babe"", etc.

Recommended for any Dylan enthusiast.",1101254400,11,434,4.931506849315069

8035751,5,B00030ETYA,This is an iconic rock'n roll song from some of the Greats. Boby Dylan and Tom Petty are so completely linked with the creation of this song. A real favorite recalling the early classics.,1386633600,,187,4.529411764705882

8035753,5,B00030ETYA,"There are many who would say that the 80s is Dylans least productive period , and perhaps that might be the case when you compare it to, the 60s and 70s which brought us such unbelievably inspiring albums such as - Bringing it all back home , Blonde on blonde , Blood on the tracks , Desire etc,etc  , it almost makes it unfair to compare.

But when you watch Dylan in action here withn Tom Petty and the heartbreakers , you will undoubtedly be amazed as to how this genius can capture an audience in the palm of his hand , hanging on every word that comes from his mouth.
No historyonics here , just one man with his guitar , harmonica and distictive voice capturing our imagination with renditions of universally reknowned songs and some not so , but each delivered by a magician at the top of his game.

I first witnessed this performance in 1987 when i was 16 years old , and it changed me forever , and i will never forget the moment when i stood up in front of the tv and gave him a standing ovation after performing a spine tingling version of ""Its alright ma im only bleedin"" almost as if i was there in the crowd.

There born that day was my love of Bob Dylan and my desire to hear everything he had to offer.
Yes there are performers he will offer you extreme light shows , synthetic sounds and guest appearances by the rich and famous , but if you just want honest good music with lyrics unparralleled by any other artist in the history of music , then this is as good a starting point as any to get aquainted.

During this performance you will be taken on a ride covering virtually every spectrum of Bobs career - Love songs such as "" Just like a woman"" , Religious songs such as "" In the garden""  Protest songs such as ""Like a rolling stone"" acoustic songs no more beuatiful than "" Girl from the north country"" and stomping rock songs perfected in ""when the night comes fallin from the sky""

So go on , buy this dvd and start something special for yourself , you will not regret it , next step is to see the great man himself in person , something everybody should do at least once.

Hard to handle definately gets 5 stars from me",1331510400,3,2143,4.197080291970803
8035754,5,B00030ETYA,This is must have for any Bob Dylan fan.  Dylan performs good live versions of some of his big hits.  Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are a good combination.  It is unfortunate that this concert film is out of print.,1329696000,3,230,4.3023255813953485
