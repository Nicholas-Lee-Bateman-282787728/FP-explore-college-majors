2770216,5,B000NJVY3U,"I saw Connections when it first aired, and now I am delighted to see it again.  James Burke is always interesting, and his explanations of how events in history are interrelated are wonderfully done.  My own  children were quite young when we saw it first, and it was a program that they never wanted to miss; this is a series that will do wonders for any child who thinks history is boring, and it might teach him/her to look a bit more deeply for cause and effect amid all that information. I would think that most children from about age eight up--certainly by ten--would be fascinated by this enchanting look at our civilization's attributes, their origins, and their relationships with each other.

Much as I love this series, though, I do think that if there is only one set to be bought at this price it should be _The Ascent of Man_, by Jacob Bronowski. The Connections programs delight the mind with their clever choice and analysis of facts; Bronowski's series offers a great deal of information, well presented in a way that reaches directly to the heart and reminds us of our own humanity and the need for an understanding of it.",1183334400,75,1141,4.605911330049261
2770217,5,B000NJVY3U,"An absolutely superb series that introduces a concept connects its relationship its creation regarding science and history with a twist of philosophy. Wittingly presented by James Burke you'll find him well adapt at tounge and cheek humor as well as a stunning explination of the facts. It was the first in a number of Connections programs to be produced but the only one to be produced by the BBC. The sequential series Connections2 and 3 were produced for TLC and lack the impact and fluidity of the original.
--
Connections was a ten-episode documentary television series created and narrated by science historian James Burke. The series was produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science & Features Department and first aired in 1978. It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention and demonstrates how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events built off one another in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series is well-known for Burke's impeccable narration (especially its dry humor), historical reenactments, intricate working models, skillful use of classical music (most notably O Fortuna from Carmina Burana), and shots on location as far afield as Penang. The popular success of the series led to two sequels, Connections2 in 1994, and Connections3 in 1997, both produced for TLC. (Wikipedia)",1182211200,47,1423,5.357142857142857
2770218,5,B000NJVY3U,"A fantastic series which makes one think about how we have the material and product that we have today. It shows how one idea or invention can lead to the creation of another and that our life today is a series of stepping stones through time.

Highly recommended for all people of all ages with an inquisitive mind.",1178928000,3,316,4.448275862068965
2770219,5,B000NJVY3U,We enjoyed watching the first Connections on PBS many years ago and have been anxiously waiting for the DVD's to be released.  This is the best of the series.  An excellent and thought provoking series.,1178928000,10,202,4.742857142857143
2770220,4,B000NJVY3U,"I love these Connections dvds. The visual quality is top-notch. My whole family has gotten a lot of education and entertainment from these unique, fascinating reviews of man's technological advancements. I would recommend them whole-heartedly except for one small problem: in Volume 3, Distant Voices, there is a very brief episode of nudity with  a plainly sexual theme. We have only viewed Volumes 1-7, so I'm not sure if there is more objectionable material in other Volumes. But I suspect that, if there is, it will be short and manageable.

Connections 1 is a wonderful set that shows man's history in a different light - one that emphasizes cause and effect helps to dispel the notion of history as a series of unrelated episodes. Much of the information moves along quickly, so this may not be much use to kids younger than 13 or so. And I repeat my warning: preview before watching!",1178755200,14,890,4.810457516339869
2770221,5,B000NJVY3U,James Burke is the man! He's presents a very informative and entertaining way of learning about history's inventions and those behind them. Its an ingenious way of linking discoveries together that brings us the things that we take for granted today. I used to watch his series when it was on tv when I was a kid and he inspired me to get into engineering and shaped my career. Going back and watching it now I find it just as exciting to watch as it was back then.,1177200000,18,465,4.295454545454546

2770224,5,B000NJVY3U,"Quite possibly the BEST SERIES EVER about the history of ideas and how they intermarry and produce the unlikeliest -- and world-changing -- offspring. All of James Burke's later series follow much the same template, and obviously have more a up-to-date technical sheen to them, because the original was made in 1978, after all. Nonetheless, I could not recommend this series more highly to anyone who wants to understand history, science, technology, religion, economics, and human nature, and how they all crossbreed with each other to produce the world we actually THINK in as well as LIVE in.",1482796800,3,595,5.081632653061225

2770228,5,B000NJVY3U,Even though it was produced in 1978 this program is still relevant and most useful in understanding how inventions link up with what is available at the time in their evolutionary process.  It causes me to think about the big picture and leads me to think about how to use technology today and where it will take us.  James Burke is absolutely the best.,1481587200,,353,4.5
2770229,5,B000NJVY3U,"Every time I watch an episode of this series, I find it stimulates my creative juices more than any other method I've ever known.

I realize that may sound a bit weird to some, but if you create or think for a living (or just for the fun of it), give it a try.  I can't specifically explain how or why this happens, but it has worked for me for decades and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Perhaps it has something to do with the way in which Burke links an outcome or invention back through a series of historical occurrences and via various tangential causes or pathways, but it really does stimulate and broaden your thought process.

Sorry I can't explain it better, but if creative thinking is something you enjoy, watch this series and see if it doesn't stimulate your thought process in ways that has nothing at all to do with the various subjects Burke covers.  It's like a powerful brain stimulant, without any of the bad side effects.",1481500800,,948,4.456647398843931
2770230,5,B000NJVY3U,"James Burke is a genius. This show tells you more about the history of humankind, then any single program ever aired ,except maybe his ""Day the Universe Changed"" and ""Connections 2"" series.  This can't come any more highly recommended. Should absolutely be required viewing for every intelligent being on the planet. How every many of us left around these days. You know,if you want rational explanations, not supernatural nonsense.
It's the one of the greatest things you can show a young adult about not only how things are the way they are but how they become that way in the first place. Simply put,beyond excellent!",1481155200,,620,4.904761904761905

2770232,4,B000NJVY3U,"I first saw Connections in the mid-eighties as a teenager. I found it delightfully engaging and influential. I learned a lot from it and it even influenced the way that I think. James Burke is a lively, witty, and engaging host and science writer. It is a must-see series for virtually anyone but especially anyone who is interested in science or history. After having not seen it since the nineties, I was glad to finally buy these DVDs quite recently.
No Blu-Rays are available, by the way, since the program was recorded in the typical way that all BBC programs were at the time, with filmed material telecined to videotape for editing. Since most everything was filmed on location, most everything was originally filmed. But the BBC didn't tend to retain the original location films as a matter of policy. What survives is by accident. Thus, apparently, only the finished videotape masters of this series exist. If all the original filmed material were found - assuming it still exists - then a high-def version could be made, though the copyright owners are unlikely to wish to go through all that trouble even if it were possible.
However, I'm not concerned with that. I'm more concerned with the fact that no cleanup has been done whatsoever. Contrast and black levels are weak. The black levels absolutely never drop to zero; blacks look dark gray. Dust and dirt abounds on the filmed portions, and there are even some videotape dropouts. The audio quality is quite good, however, and everything is quite clear and easy to hear. Nevertheless, this is an absolutely bare bones release with a relatively high price. Thus, only four stars.
Regardless, this series is an absolute classic that still holds up and is worth viewing in any condition.",1476835200,11,1750,4.8561872909699
2770233,5,B000NJVY3U,this program was everything that I remembered when I watched it on tv. there was segments that I had forgotten and I enjoyed rediscovering the segments.,1472774400,,152,4.884615384615385
2770234,5,B000NJVY3U,"I love this series.  I bought the series because none of the streaming services carry it (that I could find).  James Burke was to science reporting in Britain what Walter Cronkite was in America.  He was the BBC face that covered the moon shots.  In this series he draws a causal line between some ancient event or invention and some present day item and talks about the consequences of that path  Certainly it is well researched.  In my opinion it is much better than the subsequent follow up programs, which are often rehashes of this series.

It is getting a little dated visually.  The host wears an 1980's leisure suit, and the ""modern"" scenes are actually pretty interesting record of the late 1970's.  However, the stories are wonderful.",1472083200,4,744,4.75
2770235,5,B000NJVY3U,"Mr. Burke developed a unique series of programs, which was broadcast more than 30-years ago. It is so fortunate for me that this series is now offered on DVD's. I feel so lucky to now own these disks. Thank you so much for offering them.

2770248,5,B000NJVY3U,"At one time, this set was priced at $800!  I am glad it is finally affordable.  Burke examines how seemingly unrelated events influence the course of technological progress. The presentation is always lively and full of humor.  Unfortunately, many people will be distracted by the clear signs of age in the then current technology (e.g. a complex and bulky Loran type navigation set as opposed to a modern GPS unit.)  Still, as an easily swallowed survey of the history of technology, I recommend it.",1439510400,,500,4.916666666666667
2770249,5,B000NJVY3U,"We were living in Belgium and watching a lot of BBC TV, when we discovered these delightful history shows by John Burke. I think my son's favorite show was the one where Isaac Newton makes an egg stand on it's end.

2770251,5,B000NJVY3U,"Did you know that the invention of nautical devices in the 16th and 17th century by European seafarers is a link in an historical chain that will directly lead to the Nuclear Age of the 20th century? That the invention of move-able type printing in the mid-15th century was in part due to the devastating plague of the 14th century? That Henry VIII's breaking from the Roman Catholic Church to form England's own church is a distant link that will eventually lead to the invention of limelight used to light theatre stages in the 19th century? That the need for tar for cargo ships in the 17th century will eventually lead to the invention of a new kind of fertilizer in the late 19th century? Or how innovations in the textile industries of the 18th and 19th century were an essential component for the beginning of Information Technology in the 20th century? Or, my favorite, how some exploding billiard balls of the late 19th century will become part of a puzzle that leads to mass media entertainment. These are just a handful of the strange seemingly unrelated ""connections"" between people, inventions, motivations, places and eras that have led to some of the most extraordinary innovations of the modern age. And yet, every link, every ""connection"", is not only essential but often had nothing to do with the original intent of the inventors and/or innovators at the time.

It is almost a clich that most of the greatest inventions and innovations of the modern age were found by accident as a result of the inventor or innovator trying to solve an entirely different problem. History textbooks often present this material as a survey of end-products whose result was preordained: light bulbs, televisions, mass transit, and the like are often made to seem as inevitable outgrowths of linear progress. James Burke's ""Connections"" takes an entirely different route of explanation that is anything but linear. His hypothesis which is based on a vast assortment of historical record is that significant technological change is the result of a myriad of strange circumstances and unforeseen consequences throughout history in which, at the time, no one could have guessed the end result.

In the first episode, Burke outlines the form in which each of these ""stories"" will take place. The viewer will be a kind of detective along with Burke to discover the many twists and turns that will eventually lead to nine major scientific inventions of the 20th century. But the viewer will not know the invention with which the story will lead until the very end. And the beginning of the trail will seem very far from the end result. For example, the second episode begins with how people 3000 years ago began adapting metal for coinage as a better means to stimulate trade and commerce will eventually lead to an invention that Burke says ""affects every man, woman and child on the planet."" Another episode begins with seafaring in the ancient world. Yet another begins with medieval cannon balls.

Throughout his series, historian-commentator Burke takes us behind-the-histories of these greatest of innovations of the modern world. He often begins in the Middle Ages, sometimes earlier, in which people were simply trying to solve a particular problem at a particular moment. In one episode for example, Burke describes the European Ice Age of the Middle Ages which meant that castles and chateaus needed to be redesigned as an answer to the cold weather. Instead of large drafty high-ceilinged rooms, smaller rooms came into being along with central heating systems in which a fireplace could heat several rooms. And this also had an impact on culture. Indoor games like chess and backgammon, indoor art such as tapestries, and reading books came into vogue along with the physical stratification of the classes. Upper class people resided in the rooms upstairs while the working class occupied the lower rooms.

Burke takes the conventional wisdom of ""history"" which is too often presented as linear and inevitable and turns it on its head. This is possibly one of the most fascinating series of the late 20th century. And he also makes a ""story"" out of history. Only school textbooks could make a subject as fascinating as history so boring, and Burke shows us that this is not the case at all.",1433030400,,4296,4.945983379501385

I never forgot this show and, for years, always thought it would be nice to have it on DVD. When I did a recent search for it on Amazon, to my joy, I found it for a price that couldn't be passed up, so I got it.  When it arrived, I didn't binge watch all of it.  I paced myself and saw one episode a day.  Connections is an amazing series that should be shown to every elementary school student as well as today's history-naive college students.  What I love most about it is how it shoots that ""self-made man notion"" (every right-winger seems to believe) right in the head.  We all build upon the past--that's how the world works.  This series shows how every so-called discovery is completely built upon past discoveries.

2770263,5,B000NJVY3U,"As good now as it was when first published, Burke's series is a thought provoking ramble through ancient, classic and modern history. Sure, the Eighties hair styles, leisure suits and old cars are dated, but the concepts remain as fresh as when he first uttered them.
The hopping around the world in the series is fun to watch. When he jumps from ancient-looking Egypt to medieval looking Germany, the shock gets to you at times, but his presence ties everything together in the end. And, some of the ""conclusions"" that the individual episodes reach can be real shockers.
This is only one of a number of similar series that Mr. Burke offers, and they are all worth viewing at least once.
I met the man shortly after this series (and the associated book) was completed, and he is every bit as engaging in person as he is on the screen. The world is a better place for his analytic examination of what we have done, and I hope he continues for many more years.
(Incidentally, the best James Burke show that I ever viewed was in the early 1970s. Aired on commercial television, it was done in conjunction with Raymond Burr, and it covered technology in American history. I've never seen it available anywhere for purchase, though.)",1421020800,,1228,4.663594470046083

It helps assuage the idea that only modern man did anything smart.  It shows how technology and innovation has been a driving force for as long as man has been around. James Burke is a tremendous presenter.  He actually seems to know what he is talking about.  The Beeb always rolled him out when it needed to make the difficult seem simple or whatever in other hands might be boring, interesting.  Can't recommend this series enough.",1418688000,2,595,4.663461538461538
2770267,5,B000NJVY3U,"I cannot recommend this highly enough for the educated viewer.  More importantly, this is a wonderful gift for any young person who's considering a career in science and is not aware of the synergies of invention and engineering.
The films, wonderfully produced by the BBC, show the development of inventions, from an obscure and (apparently) unrelated innovation or discovery to the final product.  For instance, a scientist noted that static could be heard at a distance over a metallic wire.  This led to the most transformative invention of modern times(the telegraph) which led directly to the telephone, the radio, the television, and finally the internet.
What's so informative is that we see it wasn't just a lone inventor but instead a zeitgeist(spirit of the times), with a bit of serendipity(pluck and luck), that led to each small step.  From the rockets of the Chinese to the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo to the Moon; we see it all.
As with Carl Sagan, James Burke is just the gentle and re-assuring voice of reason and learning, taking us by the hand for each segment.  It's a fantastic journey you can take and then gift to the next generation.  Unlike any other gift you can give, this one will not go out of style or purpose.",1418083200,,1246,4.772093023255814

That's when I remembered James Burke's Connections series;  Burke is truly the master.  He weaves history, war, medicine, psychology, physics -- you name it -- all together to explain how things came to be invented and why, and how these inventions changed and continue to change our lives.

One thing I particularly like is his technique for finding these connections is a lot simpler in the age of search engines than card catalogs (even if I still miss them) so you can do little ""connections"" as a hobby; although of course the entertaining scenes and dramatic shots and story flow and always ending on something big and other endearing qualities of this series are missing.

My only complaint is the transfer reminds me of those old 16mm classroom file projectors in the 1960's/70's (hence the missing 5th star) but the content is all intact and that's what matters most.",1416700800,2,605,4.752380952380952

Like all the movies made in the 1970's with their weird soundtracks, Connections has a little too much production. The Connections 2 is completely different, and very, very enjoyable to watch.",1403827200,,282,4.895833333333333
2770287,5,B000NJVY3U,"This really struck a chord with me.  While it was produced back in the 1970s and may seem outdated in some superficial ways, the concepts he talks about--the influence of technology upon our lives--is one thousand times more relevant today than it was back then.  Each 50-minute episode focuses upon one major technological development that has profoundly influenced how we live: jet travel, telecommunications, the computer, and so forth.  I became fascinated with his idea of the Trigger Points, and how a simple, unintended discovery can set off an equally unanticipated chain of events that may change the world forever.  He'll start off an episode with the Battle of Hastings in 1066, for example, and by the end he's convinced you that the invention of the stirrup led indirectly to the development of the atomic bomb.  A history lesson about the growth of technology through the centuries, each episode is suffused with Burke's curiosity, irrepressible humor, understated delivery, and an appreciation for serendipity, leaving the viewer wanting more.  I will often direct young people to watch this series, and, far from being unable to relate to something so old (polyester leisure suits, rotary-dial telephones, etc,), they become fascinated with it and want to watch all of the episodes.  Burke wants us to ask ourselves probing questions about the influence of technology in our lives.  Who produces it?  Are we just mindless consumers?  Or do we have some control over what is made?  Who gets access to it or not?  For a society that prides itself on being individuals, what are the effects of living in a cookie cutter society where everyone has mass-produced goods that are identical to everyone else's?  Will this lead to our destruction?  I have watched many educational television series and documentaries over the years, but I believe this is the one that I enjoyed the most.  While I enjoyed the shorter 20-minute episodes of Connections 2 and Connections 3, the updated versions in the 1990s, it is harder to trace the causal chain in those episodes, so I prefer the original Connections.",1402617600,,2109,5.054913294797688

James Burke made the history behind our modern day world very unique. His timelines and the different people and the unique items that came together (often in ways that Malcolm Gladwell would describe decades later as a ""Tipping Point"") to create the world we live in today.
For quite a while I have thought about getting the Connections 1 set. It is rather expensive, but having watched the whole set again, i feel thatit is certainly work the price.",1402099200,,561,4.6767676767676765

For a 5-disc DVD set, the enhanced value - i.e., packaging and features - are really just horrendous. Or should I say non-existent. Whereas a 5-disc blu-ray package in contemporary series typically comes in an attractive box set, with librettos, added features, and reams of added content (making of, deleted scenes, other supporting materials, web sites, etc), this 'set' (because it's really just a series in similar minimalist packaging) has none of it! I take issue with the price as well; whereas the aforementioned contemporary box sets typically run from $40-60, this is a bust at $80-90...

Menu options for each of the DVDs is simply 'Play' or 'Scenes'. And a single click to a static page about the production house, that couldn't manage to package 5 discs any more economically than 5 individual single fold cases.

This is thoroughly enjoyable, valuable and well done content (if quaintly outdated) no question about it; hence, the five stars. But as a collector, I dread the idea of getting the remaining 3 James Burke series for essentially the same price/value ratio...

I was getting these on 16mm from my State Library system up until they stopped offering them at a reasonable price. They started charging $10 per episode and I couldn't afford them any longer. Soon after the whole Pennsylvania State Film Collection disappeared. But,... up until then I was watching these fantastic programs on a giant screen in my living room. The images were nothing less than Stunning through out the entire series I thought and seemed to be Shot in the older style of Big Screen Movies, rather than National Geographic's bow to TV and using way too many super closeups. Now that many of us are acquiring larger screen TV's and even theatre size Video Projection in our homes, I should think a series like this will turn out to be a revelation. I can't wait to get my copy of this and his other Masterpiece The Day The Universe Changed. Here, Here for the BBC and their wonderful film Photographers!!!! The bigger the screen, the more amazing this series is.

Update...

Ah well... I got a couple episodes to check from the first series from my local library and to my great disappointment they looked pretty terrible. The original film was full of dirt and it's a fuzzy low res transfer and just not what it can be. Certainly James monologue is still compelling. But at least the first season did not have that great photography I remembered. It's fast and quick TV shooting. Even that would still be OK if the transfers were better. Maybe I was looking at The Day the Universe Changed? Or perhaps one of the later entries, but these first DVD's from Ambrose looked pretty bad to me.

2770326,5,B000NJVY3U,"'Connections' along with the other James Burke Series 'The Day the Universe Changed' are the best documentary series ever made in my opinion. Back in the 1990s both series were aired on The Learning Channel (TLC), and it was at this point I originally saw them. Both of these series should be required viewing in high schools and universities. The message they present never ages, which in itself is amazing for a documentary. This series will hook you in right from the start!

James Burke is an excellent presenter (with a great sense of humour as well) who keeps you interested all along the way. To better understand the world we live in today, and how we all got here, I strongly recommend both of these series. You will never tire of watching them. You will not look at the history of science and technology the same ever again.

I have ordered the sequel series 'Connections 2' and 'Connections 3' as well. I will be reviewing them once I have gone through both series. If you are a big James Burke fan, be sure to also check out 'Apollo 11 - A night to Remember"". This documentary recaps the original broadcasts of the Apollo 11 moon landings aired on the BBC. James Burke provides helpful-and sometimes hilarious-demonstrations of spaceflight technology, experiencing zero gravity, and by wearing a the spacesuit the same as the ones used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin for walking on the Moon.

2770334,5,B000NJVY3U,"Years ago I worked the graveyard shift on an emergency phone line in a small town in Kentucky.  The Learning Channel had just been added to the cable line-up.  It was late and I was bored, so I started watching this new channel.  They featured this show called Connections with James Burk.  I'd never had any passing interest in history or how it was made up and I totally expected this show to bore me and I could make fun of it.  I even readied myself to make fun of it.

The problem was the show totally captivated me.  James Burk's ideas and presentation showed me a history I'd never seen before.  It was a history that was captivating and energetic.  James shows a history that's not full of blood and death, but of exploration and hope.  He shows how wonder and excitement had driven some people to produce the most modern wonders.

It's easy to think that we've achieved everything we can, until you see this series.  This series clearly has a great feeling for how to move forward based on where we were.  I suggest the first three seasons of this series, but I tell people to NOT miss the first season.

On the flip-side, given every good thing I ever said about this series, my wife of 23+ years fell asleep less than 10 minutes into the first episode.  So, I don't know, maybe I'm drinking Draino.  :)",1316044800,5,1313,4.385892116182573

2770340,5,B000NJVY3U,"Most people know intuitively that scientific discoveries lead to other discoveries, but science historian James Burke makes this concept explicit in ""Connections.""  Burke goes all over the world to show how, from ancient times to recent history, inventions have stimulated more inventions and change has stimulated more change.

Burke uses examples such as the inventions of movable type, the tin can, and air conditioning in this series which examines change and development in the fields of astronomy, medicine, industry, finance, and more.  The narrator shows the role of geometry and math in general in building civilization and shows how important technology was in warfare.  By comparing civilizations, Burke describes the importance of the profit motive and incentives in achievement and invention.

Even though this series originally appeared on the BBC in 1978, and many important inventions have come about since then, this series holds up well.  ""Connections"" shows the degree to which we are dependent on technology and makes the viewer wonder what might be invented in the future based on the inventions that our current era has produced.",1300320000,,1151,5.402234636871508

It tells us all how dependent we are on technology and shows how each advance in the past has led to something we live with now.

 I'm fairly harsh in my documentary reviews because the first documentaries that I actually paid attention to were Connections and Cosmos. I recently bought this (did I really pay $90?). I have to say that Burke still holds up and even surpasses most documentaries made since. Somehow, someway, he puts that reserved Brit enthusiasm right through the screen. Other than his modish style clothes, the series holds up very well.
 If you're thinking of getting it for grandma, be aware there is some brief nudity.

2770344,4,B000NJVY3U,"Connections and ""The Day the Universe Changed""(there's also ""After the Warming"" which tries to connect everything in terms of global warming; for instance, that maybe the Minoans and Myceneans civilizations collapsed because of shift of climate, and that maybe science and technology started when things got cold . . . that early Homo Sapiens and even Neanderthals that drew pictures in caves used fire to survive for instance) are fun things to think about.  They are worth thinking about in terms of thinking about a mystery. What causes change in human society?

One of my favorite examples of what I'm seeing in James Burke's ideas here is David Goodstein, in his mechanical universe, points out how the British made their lightning rods with a spherical top because the King(I think it's the same King George found in the 'Declaration of Independence""), and not just pointed tip. There's scientific connections and there's these cultural connections like the lightning rod example above.  James Burke seems to want to show all these cultural affects to, mostly technological developments.  Every now and then, he requires some science connections.

The cultural connecitons, as I'm calling them, is all fine and good. To me, the model for scientific discovery is the discovery of the solar system.  That we couldn't just send off some spacecraft to a polar orbit, look straight down, and say, ""Hey, look at that!  The planets go around the sun, and not the other way around.""  We had notice oddities, like the retrograde motion of the planets, the changing phases of the moon, to decode from our current perspective(our cultural biased conceptions/cultural connections), the facts/logic of the solar system.

Aristotle had all kinds of these vague notions of physics that didn't help much - bodies tend to stay put because that's their natural place to be. And, things need a force to keep them moving.  It took Galileo to see the underlying structural relations of friction to tease out the amazing fact that different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum. He also had some logic that drove him; if two masses are connected, then two contradictory things must happen - 1) they must fall slower, because the lighter mass is pulling up from the heavier mass, and 2) they must go faster because they are a combined heavier mass now.

Susanne K Langer in her ""an introduction of Symbolic Logic"" points out, chapter 3 - Essentials of logical structure, there's personal conceptions with different contexts of the same concept. If you say one word, you have all kinds of personal contextual ideas of what relates to that idea. In a sentence, the word run generally makes sense only with me telling you to run.  You don't generally say, houses run the race.  You might say house runs the world, depending on the meaning of 'house.' An example in the book is ""these should be rubbed together in a smooth paste.""  Here, you know this refers to flour, sugar, and so on. But, this could also refer to a mechanic putting together some sealant. The conception can take on multiple contexts. There's often a cultural flavor to most people's conceptions.  James Burke, in his Connections seems to want to find the technological origins in these cultural flavors.

 To see people who have to overcome their cultural biases, for whatever reasons. A people goes to war with another, the climate changes, and those gods must not have been the real gods. That style of dress doesn't work out in the woods like it does in the ballroom, or something like that!  As my David Goldstein example of the lightning rod shows, there are these types of connections, but the real connections, as I like to call them, are these underlying structural relations, that we end up calling mathematics and logic.  These things come about in much the same way we discovered the solar system.

James Burke's Connections here, and his other works really, kind of mix these cultural connections and real connections in a fun way. But, some of these connections are not always quite correct.  For instance, he says the longbow led to the cannon - not quite in my opinion perhaps. But, in showing the history of the longbow, we see some great cultural connections of the medieval society of the Knight on horseback.

When I looked at some of the real connections, I noticed some remarkable connections between them and what Jacob Bronowski points out about the nature and origin of mathematical knowledge, in his ""Origins of Knowledge and Imagination.""  I'll leave a link to my right up about that in the comments section.",1290729600,,4588,4.891612903225806

I've built a Technology class around the book that accompanied the series, and my son's reward for completing a chapter in the book is watching the corresponding episode of the program.

2770349,5,B000NJVY3U,"I have been looking for years to buy the series.  I've had the companion book since the series first came out but was excited to watch the series again.  The first and last episode are very thought provoking about what would you do if these events/inventions hadn't happened.  If you don't watch episodes 2-9 (you are missing a lot) - please watch watch episodes 1 and 10.

The computer revolution episode may seem a little dated (although I'm a little dated because I worked with those technologies) but think what it would be like if we were still using those storage technologies and what may happen with our current storage technologies 10 years from now (will we be able to even read a DVD data disk?)  What is the next ""connection"" that may happen?

For those who missed the series in the late sixties, Connections is primarily about the history of technology and the places technology would appear - such as time measurement arising from monks wanting to pray at the same hour in the night.  Now you know who gave the world the idea for an alarum clock.

2770352,5,B000NJVY3U,"This series of ten programmes was mind-blowing when it was first shown in 1978, and is still mightily impressive today. James Burke was a 'natural' as a science journalist, making his mark in the equally famous 'Tomorrows World' series (before the producers decided to make it 'entertainment'). I've no idea if it won any awards - but it certainly deserved them...

After a slightly slow start, each episode takes the form of a scientific 'detective novel', as he follows a trail of seemingly odd inventions which then build, generation on generation, to critically significant developments in our modern world. And, with the cash coming from famous co-production company ""The Learning Channel"" (TLC), the production has plenty of real location shots and historical staging - no 'Dr Who' BBC cardboard sets here! The last episode is a form of round-up with a warning - from the time when humans picked up the first stone tool, we were committed to using technology, for good or ill; there is 'no way back', so we'd all better get involved in discussions about how it's used.

James Burke did make two follow-up series (many years later), now also available on DVD. They are certainly in the 'worth a look' category, but 'Connections 1' is way, way up the list of 'must haves' - and now I have my copies, I can thoroughly recommend!",1266710400,,1331,4.833333333333333

2770358,5,B000NJVY3U,"When my father got this series on DVD last Christmas, I was pretty skeptical that I would enjoy it when I sat down to watch it with him.  The cover shows Burke, not a particularly interesting photo of him, and the DVD menus were only OK, no high production values there.  Indeed, when you start into the series you notice the age of the film.  Shot a couple of decades ago the film and the narration show their age.  And despite all of this, and my own skepticism, I really enjoyed the series!

The series profiles an invention from historic times and then leads you on a series of ""connections"" or newer inventions that were brought about by the previous one.  Burke does an excellent job making this series of successive inventions interesting and fun to follow.  I found myself enjoying the science and history lesson found in each of the episodes.  I know some will be turned off by what I mentioned above, and the first episode of the series does a bad job of drawing you in, but those who stick with it will be richly rewarded with a fascinating documentary.

2770361,3,B000NJVY3U,"After seeing this rated highly in NetFlix and here, I just had to see this series so I checked the first three discs out at the Library.

Yes the first episode held my attention, and reminded me of the blackout in 2003(wondering why almost 40 years later we STILL had a similar problem to the one in 1965).  I took to the idea of ""connections"" through time via human ingenuity and inventions laid one upon the other overlapping, parallel, non-linear as a fascinating concept and one that is so obvious if you have ever stopped (as he asks us in the first episode) to look around you in wonder at the creations man hath wrought. Fascinating.

Unfortunately.. I found myself time after time falling asleep watching this series.  I guess that's my reaction to history.. and although interesting to follow history via invention laid upon invention, I could not get through the rest of the first three disks.  Constant reference to the atomic bomb hanging over our heads dates the series some (cold war still simmering), but mostly for me the leap past several hundred years to draw a connection between some of the inventions was too much of a tenuous thread...and found myself asking why we could not see the change that happened in between the inventions of 1500 and 1861 for instance.  Not to mention the schizophrenic pace set (the man talks faster that ANYone I have ever met), and after a while I found myself dozing to the sound of his voice.  Fascinating topic and approach to History, however I just could not ""connect"" with this series, and sent all three disks back to the Library having gotten only half way through.  Interesting, but could not hold my attention.  Giving this 3 stars in deference to the other high ratings, and realizing I was probably WAY too tired to be able to focus on what so many other people see as a great documentary series.  Too bad, I was looking forward to seeing this concept played out, and it did not meet my expectations.

2770367,5,B000NJVY3U,"Years ago, this series was shown on one of the ""Discovery/History"" channels.  I found it enthralling then, and in spite of thirty-year time gap since it was produced in 1978, ""Connections"" is every bit as absorbing and thought-provoking as when I first viewed it.  The ideas and problems it presents are timeless, and technology has grown even more pervasive and complicated.

James Burke raises a number of questions in the various episodes, such as, ""What would happen if, for some reason, the 'technology island' in which we now exist were to be disrupted or shut down?""  He also brings up the point that, if we (meaning most of us) do not comprehend the nature and workings of the complex, technological devices upon which we depend, we will not be able to make sensible judgements concerning their use and control.  How and when should we use them? Should their use be limited or regulated in any way?  If so, how?

Burke does not offer many answers here; he merely shows what the track record of discovery and invention has been so far.  He jumps about in history, pointing out the connections (sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle) between many of the important discoveries and ideas that have shaped our world.  Even after several viewings, one can still gain new perspectives on history, culture, technology and the fascinating manner in which they interact.

The series is a long one.  There are five DVD's, each containing two episodes of roughly fifty minutes each.  However, the material is so engrossing that the time passes swiftly.  At the end, I remember feeling slightly dizzy, thinking, ""What a ride!""",1236816000,2,1619,4.929889298892989

2770377,5,B000NJVY3U,This is an excellant series.  The DVD is clear and sharp in both audio and video aspects.  The material is presented intellectually with humor by James Burke.  The film production is spectacular.,1218326400,3,195,5.03125
2770378,5,B000NJVY3U,"Don't miss this series!  Absolutely fabulous overview of world history, mechanics, medicine, technology, everything.  He explains how we got to where we are (or rather, were; the series is over 10 years old and lots has changed even since then).  So interesting, so much to learn, so much ""I didn't know that!"" and ""Wow, what a great.... CONNECTION!""",1214438400,,350,5.0
2770379,5,B000NJVY3U,"Apart from a few gifted teachers, the problem with teaching history - and learning it - is that they're doing it wrong. Human events are not linear; they are not Henry Ford's definition of history: one damned thing after another. Nor are the most significant developments in history the product of men and women with singular genius. Rather, they are often enabled by outright fools. This is why Connections is important. This is why it's so captivating. I'd say that only a polymath like Burke could have done it, but no doubt he'd point to a series of failed or silly authors and professors who planted the notion in his fertile and restless brain, or the chance meeting that made him decide that he really didn't want to become an oboe player.

Would all the significant achievements he notes have come to pass anyway by other means? Of course. Are his causal linkages always sound? Of course not. That's not the point. What Burke delivers is a view of human events that will leave you unable to see history as a tedious, linear march through time ever again. Therein lay its enduring brilliance.",1212364800,,1099,4.694300518134715
2770380,5,B000NJVY3U,"I saw James Burke's Connections Series when it came out years ago and it made a tremendous impact on me.  I then read the book cover to cover!

It was a joy to watch Burke carefully take us (the viewers) with him on an amazing journey.  He showed time and again how people throughout history used their critical thinking skills to create amazing human creations from seemingly unrelated discoveries and decisions that were made before them.

Burke showed that whatever we create today, we can't possibly imagine what type of morphing it will go through time and what incredible thing it may become tomorrow.

Connections (the series and book) also allow us to peek into the mind of the inventor.  For example in his book Connections, Burke writes about Thomas Edison:  ""When Edison died he had over a thousand patents filed in his name, thanks to the work of the men in his laboratory.  Each man was a specialist in his field, serving the needs of Edison's fertile imagination as well as his acute understanding of the seller's market in which he lived.  Edison never developed an idea unless he knew in advance that it would be profitable.""

Years after reading the book and watching the series I went to a James Burke lecture.  He is as personable, passionate, interesting, animated and fun in person as he is on the series!  At one point during the lecture I asked a question and he answered it and joked with me.  When he signed my book later he asked if I was okay with his ribbing.  I said I was pleased that he had such a great sense of humor and allowed me to be part of it!

The underlying theme in connections is how we as humans are connected to our species though our works and discoveries.  We are in this thing called life together!.

6 Stars for this Series and Book...5 stars just isn't enough!

2770384,1,B000NJVY3U,"In the Connections Series,  James tries to trace a series of past events that he claims are ultimately responsible for today's technological advances and conditions.  I was referred to this series from a review about Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything.""

Made in the late 1970's, this series has turned out to be very disappointing for me.  The material is presented in a dense and non-interesting way...  It's like watching a series with old Star Trek acting but without the old Star Trek charms and messages...

Seriously, trying to trace the causation of anything requires a true expert.  Anyone can trace a path in a web of causations and claim a revelation (hence the existence of so many conspiracy theories!).  A true guide can trace the important and less revealed paths and take you on a insightful and revealing journey.  Unfortunately, James is no such a guide.",1197590400,16,889,4.912751677852349

2770386,5,B000NJVY3U,"Connections really lives up to its title -- but you don't know it fully until the very last minute of the very last episode.

My husband and I watched this series years ago when it was on cable tv.  Now we homeschool our three children and are delighted with the opportunity to show it to them.

The series weaves tales of happenings throughout history and manages to bring all sorts of interesting tidbits of information on happenings from seemingly insignificant to very important.  But you realize towards the end how important all of those incidents are to today.

There is a prophetic episode of ""what if"" society suddenly breaks down and all technology shuts down at once.  I say prophetic, because so much of what he alluded to happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

This is an important series for parents to watch and then watch a second time with their children.",1197072000,15,882,4.7254901960784315

Burke's wit, flair for expression, and ability to explain complex subjects in a compelling way for the layperson make this series both informative and entertaining. More importantly, his ability to establish linkages through history of the sequence of seemingly unrelated technological breakthroughs makes for compelling television.

2770389,5,B000NJVY3U,"First off, I like to say the first time saw the Connections series I was hooked. When Connections 2 & 3 came out I had to watch them as well as the series The Day the Universe Changed. James Burke really knows how to make history interesting. He made connections you wouldn't see or even think about. Wish he made more of this kind of stuff can't get enough if it.

OK, now a word of warning. These great series are now public domain; people are starting to put together copies of their own disks and selling them. These copies may not be of good quality and may even be duplicates of the disks made by Ambruse Video. If you see a new seller or just listed with a price less than $80 it is probably one of these copies and I don't recommend buying them.",1190332800,107,753,4.157534246575342
2770390,5,B000NJVY3U,"This series by James Burke is just superb. Although 30 years old, the history is presented in such a way that it all seems brand new. He takes everyday objects and after detailing our modern day dependance on them, goes on to describe some improbable and yet refreshing connectins to various points, places and people in history without whom some of these modern objects may have taken longer to discover, and in some cases not discovered at all. A very good ""potted"" history lesson, and more importantly, you will enjoy the time spent watching.",1189296000,2,545,4.808510638297872

Everyday objects, such as the television, are shown as a result of a series of connections culminating in everyday objects we take for granted. Each one presented as a series of events which at any point in time may have taken a different direction. A great series which is highly entertaining and incredibly informative and don't let the age of the collection put you off, it is still relevant even after thirty years as energy demands, war and the influence of polititians over populations is put under an analytical spot light.",1183939200,12,712,5.0423728813559325

8178732,4,B000NJVY3U,"This television serious does a pretty good job at showing the complex and almost seemingly random connections of events, scientific, political, personality, etc. that have led to scientific/technological advances throughout human history. The program does a very good job at showing how, surprisingly, many times randomly and by sheer chance many of these advances were made. It also illustrates well how a plethora of other factors have also contributed. An important one of these involved the role of the state. It is quite remarkable how the demands of nations, in particular demands related to military affairs, have led to scientific advances. In one episode for example, one learns of state impetus to the development of pre-packaged food. Napoleon offered the first prizes to anyone who could solve this problem (bottled food was the result). After he was successful the British Navy one upped him by serving as an impetus for tinned food.

The show itself was made by the BBC and shown in many countries, primarily on their public/state owned networks in the 1970s. It is well filmed and very well narrated. James Burke, the narrator, is always interesting and does a very good job at keeping the viewers interest. The show is filmed in a wide variety of locations throughout the world and this does a very good job at keeping the viewers interest.

However, being made in the 1970s it does have a number of weaknesses. One is that it is relatively manufacturing centered. Considering that, at this time, the relative importance of the manufacturing sector to service, this is no surprise. A second problem is that it does not cover the economic impetus (i.e., profit motive) of many innovations in their developmental/implementation stage. For example, in the canned food example cited above, there is no mention of how demand among consumers, outside of state military institutions, was the real factor leading to the maturity of the canned food industry.

Thirdly and most importantly, by far, the TV program ignores the importance of institutional factors. These include the role and importance of universities, legal protections related to patents provided by a judicial infrastructure, the tolerance of differing views in societies (it was no accident that science so advanced during the French and English enlightenments), etc. Then again, even economic historians ignored the role of many institutions in the 1970s. Only starting in the 1980s did the works of economic institutionalists such as Nobel prize winner Douglas North start to have an impact.

Despite these weaknesses, the show is still very highly recommended for those interested in the development of science and technology.

In conclusion, even though what is written above was specifically written about the first season of connections, it applies almost exactly to the follow up seasons. The follow up seasons suffer from the same strengths and weaknesses and to equal degrees.",1491091200,2,2960,5.223157894736842

James Burke had such an impact on me that some of his phrases have become a part of my vernacular; such as ""Hardwicke Hall-more glass than wall.""

Burke's delivery is unique and charming. His only equals are Carl Sagan and Jacob Bronowski--both great teachers. This series must go down as one of the true classics of video history.",1489536000,3,524,4.574468085106383
