8072740,5,B000A2WCOA,"First saw this on PBS some years back and loved it then and now! Watch the renown Voice Coach for the Royal Shakespeare Company working with high school kids, get a glimpse into her passion for the words, especially Shakespeare's, and how she shares it. Watching her rehearse with students from all over the world is illuminating and insightful - how lucky they are to work with her!
For those interested in improving vocal skills and techniques, I recommend any of her books (especially for actors), rather than this video.

8072741,2,B000A2WCOA,"My expectation with this video was ""it will teach me how to use language and tone in presentations.  But it was more about this woman and how she teaches her theater students ""method"".  I was disappointed in the video for this reason.  It is more a biography than a tool.",1420502400,,271,4.38
