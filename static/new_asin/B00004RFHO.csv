1343539,5,B00004RFHO,"""The Yearling"" is a 1946 family classic with Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman, and Claude Jarman, Jr. It's also a movie that has grown on me each time I have watched it. Of all of director Clarence Brown's films, including ""National Velvet"", ""The Yearling"" has the most chock-full of enjoyable and memorable scenes. Even though the story is centered around Jody (Jarman, Jr.) and his pet fawn Flag, for me it's more about Jody and his father Penny Baxter (Peck). Their relationship is the best father-son relationship I've seen in a film. Gregory Peck can play fathers in movies better than most actors because his characters always listen to their children. Claude Jarman, Jr. received a special Academy Award for this film, and deserved it. During the last half of this movie, I was so amazed by how well he could cry. His performance ranks among the very best performances from child actors in movies. The ending both breaks my heart and fills me with hope, when the father tells Jody about life and when the mother (Wyman) finally opens up her love to Jody. This is what quality family entertainment used to be, and I love it.",990662400,37,1122,4.700507614213198
1343540,5,B00004RFHO,"This wonderful film is one of a handful that has the power to call me back to my childhood days and wrap me in warm memories of my Mom, Dad and little brother sitting around the television on Saturday night, watching the late  show.
From the opening scenes of this beautifully photographed movie I  found myself caught-up in the intriguing post Civil War story of a boy and  his pet faun and their fantastic adventures on a scruffy Florida Everglades  farm. The film stars Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman in the lead  roles, with some of Hollywood's best character actors in the colorful  supporting roles.
Peck gives an Oscar caliber performance as the  warmhearted father who tries his best to make a better life for his family,  with absolutely no help from the elements, which surround them. Jane Wyman  plays his wife Orry, the hardened mother and wife who is so embittered by  past tragedies in her life that she refuses to show any love for her one  remaining child for fear of losing him too. And Claude Jarman plays Jodie  the wistful young son who is just one summer away from adolescence and all  the hardships that come with growing up.
This story is chock-full of  excitement and adventure sure to please the kids, and each of those  adventures is also a great lesson on life that will stay with them for  years to come. Just watching Jodie romp with his pet faun for that one  fleeting summer is a joyous site to behold and the touching scenes where  Orry finally begins letting herself love her son will bring tears to your  eyes. And of course the heart-rending scenes of Jodie trying his best to  get the yearling to run away so he won't have destroy it, all come together  to make  this movie one of the most emotional experiences of my childhood  and I must say I believe I'm a better person for the values I learned from  this timeless story.
Experience this film with your children, you won't  be sorry you did.",958521600,65,1943,4.530259365994237
1343541,5,B00004RFHO,"The Yearling is a movie I have watched repeatedly and it never fails to make me cry.  Each time I watch it I find something new to enjoy about the dialogue, subtle humor and deep sadness evoked when Jody stops being ""a yearling"" and leaves his childhood behind.  The scenes between  Jody and his pet deer, Flag,  are touching in their innocence and the sheer  joy you share when seeing them run and jump and play.  Gregory Peck is  wonderful (as usual) as the understanding father - dealing with his desire  to let his son enjoy childhood a bit longer and to shield him from some of  life's more bitter lessons.  Jane Wyman as the stoic mother, Ory -  brilliantly portrays a woman who has locked her heart away after the death  of 3 of her children, and finds it difficult to let herself freely love her  surviving son, Jody.  When Ory finally realizes she can open her heart to  her son even though life makes no guarrantee against pain, it is a moment  that any mother can relate to.  I recommend this movie to adults and  teenagers, but I feel that the scene where the yearling deer must be  destroyed is too heart-rending for smaller children.  (I'm 43 years old and  I STILL cry like a baby when the deer must be shot !  ) But it's still a  movie worth watching over and over again!",955584000,8,1287,4.337552742616034
1343542,5,B00004RFHO,"When I grew up I stopped seeing over and over the movies I liked.  Not this one.  I do see this film over and over, but instead of getting numb, I become more even more affected.  There are certain scenes, happy or sad,  that are so evocative, so transcendent that, I'm embarrassed to say, I can  feel tears well up in my eyes.  I'm not looking at myself, or even the boy  in the film.  I'm looking at childhood itself - and its end.
Find some  quality time, darken the room, dispense with your sophisticated baggage.  And let yourself go.",927676800,23,539,4.3
1343543,5,B00004RFHO,"I have often thought of this movie as the best movie ever filmed.  From its opening scene it draws you into the life of a family struggling for its existence against the forces of nature.
But it is the actors that make  this film memorable, especially the two boys who are growing into maturity.  Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman portray parents who have had misfortunes and  love their son deeply.  The father-son relationship between Peck and Jarman  is particularly touching.
The relationship between Fodderwing (sp?) and  Jarman is remarkable in its realistic portrayal of their close association.  These two young actors deserve applause for their excellent job!
The  main events which spur the spiritual growth of Jarman are associated with  his taking of a fawn for a pet.  The scene in which Fodderwing's name for  the pet is given to Jarman is one of the most touching I have seen on the  screen.
This is a movie I will always treasure.",921456000,7,940,4.763975155279503

1343583,5,B00004RFHO,"I just watched this movie on television last night. I orignally saw it many, many years ago. Even though it is almost 70 years old (originally released in 1946) it holds up very well. I thought the scenery was Hollywood style just too pretty and then was amazed to hear the tv host comment that the director had had a dificult time convincing the studio to allow it to be filmed in Florida. The actors labored through heat, humidity and hoards of mosquitos. One studio hand commented that never again would any of the crew return to this film in the Florida swamp land! I have to defend anyone's criticism of the  acting. 10 year old Claude Jarman Jr. played the role as a wide-eyed innocent brilliantly, Gregory Peck was a wonderfully warm father and sweet Jane Wyman played the part of a prickly mother quite well.  If I'm being picky I would say that Jane Wyman's hair was a little too neat, thought it odd that Gregory Peck never needed a shave and noted that their cabin seemed a little too luxurious. Parts of it (Peck modeling his wife's new dress) had me laughing and other parts had me in tears. It's really not a young kid's movie--too much heartache, I believe.",1423440000,,1172,4.497652582159624

Granted the first one was due to a storm, but the next three were eaten by the deer.  They should have shot the animal after he ate the first crop and served him up for supper.

Gregory Peck is so young, I was surprised it was him. The boy does an okay job, nothing fantastic. The animal scene, like I said, was different than in movies today. I did not like the bear/dogs scene, but I suppose they actually used dogs to hunt a bear? The moral of the story is very good and in that sense is worth watching. It is a good story and portrays what life would have been like ""roughing it"". They had to live off the land and do all the work themselves. All they had was each other. That was what made the movie worth watching, the message it portrayed. I would watch it again in a year or so. The deer scenes (of them running & jumping) and seeing the newborn deer were wonderful.

What ruined it for me was Claude Jarman,Jr in the role of Jody. The character is annoying to begin with, but the physical portrayal just ruins him completely; he runs around through the whole movie with his mouth open, looking like he's always about to cry or throw a tantrum. Jody's mentality that his pet deer is more important than his family's survival made the film very irritating to watch, and added to his unlikeability. By the end, I was GLAD they shot that stupid deer. What the hell did he expect was going to happen? You take in a wild animal, then freak out when you have to get rid of it because it follows it's instincts and eats all your crops and becomes a nuisance?

Warning to novel purists who have to have every little bitty detail: Grandma Hutto and Nelly are not here and Slewfoot is not killed. Know what you're getting into.

Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' The Yearling is one of my favorite books. My mother read it to my sister and me when we were children and later on I read it again as a teenager. There's something I find so moving, powerful and endearing about the story. Rawlings' style is so lyrical, poetic and descriptive. She did an outstanding job making me care for the three main characters and literally drew me into their world. What is so special about it is the struggles each character had and how he or she strove to overcome them. How Penny knew letting his son have a pet deer was a mistake from the start but couldn't help it because he wanted him to have the childhood he was denied. How Ora is rough, tough and cantankerous (what woman wouldn't be after three stillbirths?) on the outside but lets her inner soft streak show every now and then. How Jody realizes what makes you a man is when you do what you know in your heart is right--sacrificing for the greater good--even when it's extremely difficult.

Every scene is beautifully done and uses dialogue straight out of the book. The cinematography is knockout magnificent and deserved its Oscar one hundred percent. My favorite parts are when Jody and his pet are roaming the forest with a group of deer following close behind and after the flood when the family is outside staring at their ruined crop and BOOM! We get a long spectacular shot of the sun coming out of the clouds.

Herbert Stothart's rich orchestration and sweeping melodies based on Fredrick Delius' Florida Suite are magnificent and those choral sections especially in the dream sequence at the end are beyond amazing.

Gregory Peck is way too tall and handsome to play Penny but he's got the laid back, giant-hearted, model father persona nailed to a T. Peck is an actor I'm not too crazy about (I usually feel like his demeanor is too stiff and he `holds it in' too much) but here he completely melted into the character. My favorite of his scenes are:

1. When he's sick in bed and Jody tells him about the fawn out there in the woods all alone and helpless. Peck has a twinkle in his eye and sly smile--he KNOWS exactly where this is headed.
2. The tight frown on his face when his wife is using him as a manican for making a dress--especially when Jody walks in on them. You can see he is not thrilled in the least.
3. The climatic final discussion when Jody comes back home.

I'm usually not too crazy about child actors but I'd never know that Claude Jarman Jr. (Jody) was an amateur if I didn't read up about the making of this movie. His emotions (like when his face lights up on finding the deer and rage when his mother shoots it) are so real and he acts like he's been acting all his life. That look on his face when he tries to muster up the courage to shoot Flag--not when he pulls the trigger, just THOSE FEW SECONDS BEFORE--is absolutely unforgettable.

Jarman and Peck get two of my March Boy Leading Actor nominations and the only reason they don't win is because I split the vote for James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life.

Best of all is Jane Wyman as Ora who IMHO packed the biggest emotional punch at the end. She plays worry, care, joy and sorrow in a manner that is very real and even though she's usually grouchy and no-nonsense, you can tell that deep down inside she deeply loves her son and husband but is afraid to show it. I was touched beyond words at her acting and often wept at her performance and I usually never cry at movies. When it got to the end where she sees Jody has come home, she finally drops the rough and tough act and lets it all out ""Oh Ezra I thought I had lost them all."" And then hugs and kisses him goodnight--GOOD GRIEF that made me cry SSSSSOOO hard.

I highly recommend this movie. I think it the Jody/Penny/Ora triangle is one of the most powerful and complex portraits of a parent/child relationship ever written and I challenge anyone who sees this movie or reads the book to try to gain a deeper understanding of the struggles of growing up and the joys and sorrows of parenting.

And with a mischievous and subtle humor that will have you quietly chuckling along with him.

And the boy, played by Claude Jarman Jr., will bring tears to your eyes with his untarnished innocence, trusting his father's patient guidance and wisdom while struggling with the heartbreaking challenges of raising a tiny fawn to a full grown deer. His crippled childhood friend and spiritual mentor, movingly played by the young Donn Gift, has a curious sagelike wisdom and insight, adding to the film's depth and appeal. Their friendship and eventual parting recalls the special childhood companions that live in each of our memories.

When the snake bit Peck's arm, I jumped and thought he was going to die in this scene, but I'm glad he survived and in the way he had to shoot the deer to get a liver to draw the poison out. The church, people, way of life with the stores and Jane Wyman making her own dress, using Peck as dummy form was funny.  The weather and the young deer, growing up in a house, in the boy's bed and how beautiful the scenery was, is breathtaking.  Well worth watching!!

Her emotional responses to Penny, Jody and the circumstance they faced were well-played, however.  Peck was too handsome and healthy-looking for the role of Penny, but I guess that's what Hollywood.looked for at the time. The boy looked just as Jody was described in the book, but was a very poor actor--way too much emoting in scenes that didn't call for it. The most true-to-the story and character actor was the young boy who played ""Fodderwing.""  And of course Forrest Tucker had his turn at accurately portraying another mean, vindictive character: Lem Forrester.

The film was fairly true to the book--certainly to the gist of it. The portrayal of the eight-day rain and its devastating aftermath were realistic and very poignant as was the funeral scene. Many side-stories had to be omitted, and several scenes were in different places than they were in the book, but in general the story was told as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings wrote it.",1358121600,,1236,4.956521739130435

1343629,2,B00004RFHO,"It may be a 5-star movie for the actors (although I found some of the Jodi scenes a bit overdone and the mother just hateful), but the film was disturbing, even for this adult. Most of my objections regard the shooting of the fawn. The mother maliciously wounded the deer and didn't have the decency to kill it cleanly. If the deer needed to be killed, it should have been by the mother or father, and then explained to Jodi that they had to do it in order for them to survive. To have Jodi forced to kill it is traumatic at the least, and enough for me to develop a hatred of the mother. And at the end, I find it unbelievable that the kid would come back and be all happy and serene with his 'ma"". And all this violence is supposed to be ""character-building"" and a ""beautiful coming-of-age"" lesson? Are you crazy? I still remember growing up on a farm and the trauma of seeing more than one cat killed by a car or hay-mower. It did nothing to build my character except to vow to never have my cats go outdoors again, and to abhor the yearly slaughter of our farm animals. Oh, so the mother now feels ""love"" for her child, and is freed from the fear of losing him. what about the kid?! I bet he never will get closed to anything or any person again. ""Growing up"" and ""becoming a man"" by killing--especially forcing a child to kill his own pet-- is trauma. Period. Lessons about animals and sometimes having to kill them if it is absolutely a case for basic survival (as in the snake-bite scene) is sometimes necessary. But to call this movie a wholesome film for children, and somehow a film that many reviewers recall fondly from childhood is incredible to me. Again, the acting was fine, and i'm glad that they noted that no animals were hurt in producing this film. The story of the hardships endured by past generations is also commendable.

1343635,4,B00004RFHO,"First of all, this is a 1946 film, so young viewers used to contemporary quick video-style scene cuts and an emphasis on action over character may not have the patience to sit through this lyrical story.

The author of the book, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, grew up in the Florida Everglades, and the film's director, Clarence Brown, depicts beautifully photographed scenes of the flora and fauna of Florida's northern region. While Jody Baxter, a lonely 12-year-old, is the central protagonist, the film delves into mature themes such as man's struggle against nature for survival, what constitutes our measurement of wealth, how our experiences shape the way we perceive and approach life, and how events can precipitate the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The book received the Pulitzer Prize in 1939, and the film was nominated for academy awards in the categories best film, best actor, best actress, best director, and best film editing. Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman star in the lead roles, with some of Hollywood's best character actors playing colorful supporting roles.

The Yearling takes place in northeast Florida during the late 1870s. Jody's father, the shrewd but softhearted Penny Baxter (Peck), is a former rebel soldier trying to eke out a living for his family on a small farm. His somber wife, Orry (Wyman), has been so emotionally depleted by the deaths of several children that she cannot show love for Jody, her remaining child, for fear of losing him too. Jody, a wistful daydreamer, would rather explore the surrounding scrublands than attend to his chores, and his father, well aware of his son's loneliness, tends to forgive and indulge him, leaving Orry the role of disciplinarian and harsh realist.

The relationship between Penny and Jody is a wonderful example of a father passing on moral and ethical values, as well as the practical skills needed to survive in life. Penny shows Jody how to earn the respect of their fierce neighbors, the Forresters, how to plant crops and to hunt. In fact, it is during a bear hunt that Penny is bitten by a rattler and must shoot a doe to save his life. Not long after, Jody discovers and adopts -- against his parents' advice -- the doe's orphaned fawn, which he names Flag. His subsequent attempts to domesticate Flag and his relationship with a crippled Forrester boy, Fodderwing, lead him to the defining moments that mark his coming of age.

If you enjoy movies of past decades and stories of family life and character development, I highly recommend this film. I only wish it came in the widescreen view.",1252454400,4,2600,4.956422018348624

Jody grows to love a fawn whose mother was sacrificed to save Pa after he was bitten by a rattle snake, while hunting. Jody eventually names the fawn Flag, after his special friend dies who loves animals himself. But with growth comes anguish, Flag eats the crops. Jody builds a fence that Flag sails over to eat the second planting. Ma & Pa insist that Flag go. Well, I won't tell the whole story.

It is not a flashy, special effects movie and I can certainly understand most people finding it boring compared to the fast paced movies common today.

This is a gentle movie with each actor playing their part to reflect accurately the characters in the book. The young actor who was chosen for Jody does not play Jody, he is Jody. One of the most moving scenes in addition to where Jody shots Flag is the scene with Jody and Fodderwing in the tree house. A quiet classic one should listen and watch with care. The yearling is also a metaphor to Jody with the yearling's death, Jody's loss of childhood is reflected in this. Even to this day, I become misty eyed at the ending.

At first I watched because the scenery was pretty but it didn't take long for me to get completely involved in the story.  Gregory Peck plays the nicest man in the world (!) and he sure looks good, too.  Over and over we are charmed and awed by his strength and goodness as he copes with a cold blooded wife and their sensitive young son.  Jane Wyman is excellent as the wife who has closed her heart to all hope of happiness and joy after having lost three children.  Claude Jarmen Jr. is amazing as Jody, the son and certainly deserved his special Oscar.

There is so much wisdom in the story as the family meets life raw and unprotected by the comforts we all enjoy.  The boy, especially, must deal with the death of his only friend, (who is beautifully played by another superb child actor), the coldness of his mother, and by his deep love for his fawn, Flag.  ""Pa"" has the wisdom of Buddha and the compassion of Christ as he shepherds his young son through the agonies of his growing-up year.  The relationship of father and son is deeply touching.

We see pioneer children had a closer relationship with their parents then; as the nearest neighbor kid was a mile walk away, times were slower, no TV, children contributed to the family income at a very young age working the farm, children helped prepare meals, children took on responsibilities at a younger age, parents did things directly for their children then, such as medical-care and making things for them that today are purchased, children not only had a stay-at-home mom, but a stay-at-home dad too all working the family farm or family-business, family members depended upon one another.

1343647,5,B00004RFHO,"I just finished reading the negative reviews for this movie.  Although the good far outweighs the bad, I wanted to point out some of the negative comments and why they are without merit:

""I was so turned off, I turned (the movie) off"" - This reviewer didn't even watch it through...enough said.  This same reviewer also said ""I didn't like the looks of the little boy"" - Are you kidding?

 ""The mother's acting is nearly as bad (as the boy's) - Jane Wyman's performance is guarded and understated.  She plays a mother afraid to love her young son too much, because she has lost three other children.  She does eventually open up, let her guard down, and embrace her young son.

""Too many people die! It's very sad!"" - Yes, the movie did include three children we never see who died in infancy before the story begins.  There is another death of a child, and animals are also killed.  Sad, yes, but part of life and part of Jody's journey through childhood.  Life was hard in the post-Civil War pioneering country, and I'm sure people faced death often and were forced to make gut-wrenching decisions.

""He (Jody) cries too much, and sorry to say, he acts like a girl."" - Jody is a lonely child longing for the companionship of a pet--any animal he can love and nurture.  He was poor, he worked from sun-up until sundown, he had a cold mother, no siblings...he faced death, saw his family's crop rot from rain...I could go on and on.  The point is, he had a lot to cry about.  Some other reviewers criticized Claude Jarman, Jr's performance; however, critics raved over his moving movie DEBUT (amazing!), and he was awarded a miniature Oscar at the 1946 Academy Awards.

Other reviewers were critical of the Southern dialogue.  Yes, Gregory Peck's accent wasn't particularly convincing, but he gives an endearing, gentle performance nonetheless.  Jane Wyman was from Missouri (not far from the South), and Claude Jarman, Jr. was born in Nashville, TN.  There is too much beauty and emotion in this film to disregard it because of a lack of perfect dialogue.

1343653,5,B00004RFHO,"How any critic can give this wondrous film anything less than five stars is beyond me.  Do not apply modern or should I say post-modern values and views to a work that as a book received a Pulitzer in 1939 (back when that really meant something), or the post war 1946 movie which should have garnered even more awards than it did.  The technicolor cinematography, the haunting sound track, the incredible acting of a young Gregory Peck, a clear foreshadowing of his far more famous ""father role"" in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and yes even the fresh faced innocence of young ""Jodie,"" it all comes together with this movie.

No sense in now just reciting the plot of the story, though I think it fair to forewarn that if you are watching it with your children, especially younger ones, be ready for some tough moments at the end, both for your child and you.  I remember seeing this movie when I was six or seven and it did traumatize me, I recall my mother just holding me as I sobbed.  It was so haunting that well into adulthood I could not bear to watch the film again, until its most recent run which I captured on DVR while not watching it.  It was a long debate, I finally watched it and not ashamed to admit I cried yet again. . .but saw as well now the different side of the story, a loving parent wishing for their child to hold to, as long as possible, the innocent beautiful joy of childhood and mingled in as well, one's own memories of that time.  The final ""dream"" sequence is, without doubt, the most haunting moment ever put on film.

I finally decided to share the movie with my 13 year old daughter, forewarning her of what would happen.  She is sensitive, has a deep love for animals (we live in the forest of the Smokey Mountains) and it was warming to share our tears together as we watched the film, though she opted to turn it off when Jodie must face his terrible moment of decision regarding Flag.  I was touched by that as well, as if she was signalling that she herself wished to stay as Jodie, just a bit longer in her own life.

There are very few movies indeed, that can elicit such interaction between a parent and growing child, that can haunt as this one does. . .and yes, the lament of more than a few reviewers here. . .what has happened to our culture that such films are no longer made.",1166400000,6,2320,4.32258064516129

The music displays a passion and a craft that I've never heard before in a film.

The animal scenes are the most realistic I've EVER watched.  From the simple racoon scene, to the sweeping, running deer ballet, I've never witnessed such beauty and technical skill blended as perfectly as it was in this film.  I watched the bear/dog fight and looked over at my wife in amazement, as we both thought these dogs were getting killed. (The end credits reveal that no animals were harmed).

But, I thought it would be a lighter film than it is, more animal story than deep, moving, insightful look at both the glory and horror of life.

Focusing on the story of Jody, a lonely but loving boy growing up in post-Civil War Florida, it shows how the rough conditions and the difficulties of scraping a living shape him and his family as they struggle to survive, physically and emotionally.  Three terrific performances. OK, sure, there are a few awkward, stagey moments, but these are easily overlooked when compared to the strength and beauty of the rest of it.

This movie is a classic. And I mean CLASSIC!

Definitely not for all those bread-brains out there whose minds limit them to today's shallow sitcoms and cartoons - you know, the ones that have to keep everything simple and explain every pun and joke just so people will be able to smile and pretend they're dealing with real humor. The ones who turn up their noses at oldies just to cover up the fact that they really don't understand what's going on. These deprived people are stuck on the baby-food films of the 21st century. They need to reach back to the steak and potatoes of yesteryear's silverscreen and feast on the great classics....like...like....The Yearling!

OK, sorry....a little gut-spill there.

Anyway, this is an awesome movie. And not just for the elderly. I'm a 19-yr-old college soph. and this is one of my favorites.

Gregory Peck is perfect for the role of Pa Baxter. And the Baxters' neighbors, the Forresters, are definitely something to cackle at. Small cabin, Pa and Ma, 7 or 8 grown boys still living at home (plus the ethereally charming Fodderwing), whiskey bottles on the wall, and houn' dawgs all over the floor. Talk about hicks - they're awesome.

The movie is bursting with ""Southernly profound"" quotes that I find useful in everyday life:

""I see'd a sight today!""

""Men-folks has got to stick together in the name of peace.""

And etc. etc. etc.

So turn off 'My Wife and Kids' and pop 'The Yearling' into your DVD player. Believe it or not....it's dynamic.

1343659,5,B00004RFHO,"THE YEARLING, so beautifully shot and scored, is one of the very best postwar US films.  It will have you welling up in tears, and the acting is awfully good.  Some say that Claude Jarman, Jr didn't deserve that honorary Kid's Oscar he got for playing little Jody, but I think his performance was outstanding.  When he's romping around with Flag, the young deer, you wonder how director Clarence Brown got him to be so natural in this, his first movie.  I also liked him with Lassie and Jeanette MacDonald in THE SUN COMES UP and he was very believable as the young trouper torn between admiration for his dad (John Wayne) and devotion to his flamboyant mother (Maureen O'Hara).  Jarman was one of the few child actors with the talent to make it into acting in adult parts, and yet for some reason he did not go on, and we will continue to remember himad Jody Baxter.  In THE YEARLING his parents are in a similar situation to his parents in RIO GRANDE.  Here they are not divorced or estranged, but the mother (Jane Wyman) seems locked in the past, unable to deal with the grief of multiple miscarriages and infant births, while Penny (Greg Peck) has to go on being both Mom and Dad to young Jody.  That he does so without resentment is part of the reason that, for many of us, watching THE YEARLING is a lesson in growing up, from making the passage between boyhood and manhood.  Peck is endearing, and I don't think that even Spencer Tracy, who originated the part in an earlier, scrapped MGM version of the novel, could have bettered the performance Peck offers up here.  (Nor do I think Anne Revere could have come up to the level of emotion that Jane Wyman displays, for better or for worse, as the preoccupied mother who comes to understand, a little too late, that we should hold on to what we have instead of dreaming of lost yesterdays.

That's Margaret Wycherley in the small part of ""Ma Forrester.""  Poor Margaret Wycherley was always playing ""MA"" in the movies, and here she was about a year before her ultimate role as ""Ma Jarrett"" the all-time strangest movie mom in WHITE HEAT with James Cagney.  In THE YEARLING she's a little bit softer, with that backwoods accent she also used playing Gary Cooper's Mom, MA YORK, in SERGEANT YORK.",1115337600,13,2250,4.525925925925926

The movie, not as good as the book ( is it ever?) still, is 10X better than kiddie fare such as The Land Before Time and other drek out there. Themes are teen/pre-teen:  death - a friend, parent, pet or a peer;  the meaning of life; the mortality/fallability of parents, etc.  Will disturb children under emotional age of 8 or 9.

From other reviews,  a few misconceptions:  Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who wrote the book, did not grow up in Florida, and the book is not set in the Everglades, but rather in the rough neighborhood of 1870's East Central Florida.  Check out the map for Volusia (actually, now known as Astor,FL) and the rest of the place names pretty well remain the same.  Baxter's Island is based on Pat's Island.

1343663,5,B00004RFHO,"I had been under the opinion that I had seen this movie some years ago.  After watching it last night, I realized that either I was mistaken or I wasn't paying attention at the time because this is a movie that will always stay vivid in my heart and mind.  This is one of the most heart-rendering movies that I have ever seen and it is assembled in every way to help bring out the emotion of its' message.  The message is one of life's difficult lesson's: growing up eventually means discovering that not everything has a happy ending.  It is an important movie for families to share yet some may feel that the impact of the message is too strong for younger children.  That may well be true.  I would suggest that it is an appropriate movie for those who are at least in the 11-13 year old age group portrayed by the child  in ""The Yearling"".

This is the story of a subsistance farm family in remote rural Florida in the early to mid 1800's.  The opening scenes show us a virtual Garden of Eden but we soon come to realize that life on the land was not necessarily paradise.  We quickly become acquainted with the father, mother, and the 11-year old son, Jody.  We discover a somber and stern mother and realize why as she visits the graves of her three other children who died at early ages in this beautiful but challenging land.  We actually spend a bit too much time before we get to the heart and soul of the movie.  We meet a few too many characters and work our way through a few too many incidents.  The movie would have been just as impressive if the first half of it were 15-20 minutes shorter.

We are already pretty involved with this family when Jody gets his wish to take an orphan fawn as his own pet.  The joy they have together is shown in a series of heart-warming snippets.  Troubles starts to brew and the scenes of frollick turn into those of stress and strain.  I won't let on how this movie ends but it is a real emotional roller coaster that will start to choke even the toughest heart.  In the end, important lessons are learned by all and we are reminded how tough it is to grow up.

The acting in this movie is superb although the characters seem to go a bit too far with the backwoods slang.  Somehow ""Ma, the boy done come home!"" takes a bit away from the emotion of the moment.  It's theatrically possible to talk the talk and give the proper flavor without going as far as they did in ""The Yearling"".  That aside, Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman give excellent performances as the father and mother.  You'll be surprized to see a young and slim Chill Wills and I didn't even realize that it was Forest Tucker in one of the roles until I was watching the cast and credits at the end.  However, the outstanding performance of the movie was that of Claude Jarman Jr. as Jody.  This kid (and his pet deer) stole the show and bent our emotions in the process.

""The Yearling"" is a sort of ""Old Yeller"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" rolled up into one.  If you didn't like those movies, you might want to pass on this one.  Otherwise you need to see this movie!",1100563200,7,3077,4.275086505190312

The boy who plays Fodderwing is extraordinary, almost unearthly, in his role. The dream sequences with the deer are breathtaking, as are all the scenes which have animals interacting with people. You really get involved in this one; it is not merely a spectator event; you are THERE, with Jody and his parents, and Flag, his little deer. I have seen this too many times to count, starting when I was about 6 years old, and have never lost one iota of awe when I see it again. It is a shame that movies with this kind of heart, emnotion and inner strength/courage are not made anymore; there are simply no stories now to equal this one, and that is a pity. Still, you can go home again when you see this movie; it never loses its appeal, even through repeated viewings, and you are always immediately caught up in the story and the characters.

This is a sentimental film about unsentimentality. It's tough to see people living lives so fragile, it is threatened by the existence of a single pet fawn who forces a choice between its life and those of this small family struggling to survive in backwoods Florida when the fawn can't be kept out of the vegetable patch.

But there's much to appreciate here about familial relationships, human change and growth, childhood innocence and awe, simple pleasures. The story itself is beautiful if heartbreaking. I love the film. It is typical of family films from the 40's and 50's - characters are done archetypically - the father's kind, moral, hardworking; the mother cold, strict, hard hearted; the child innocent, honest, ernest; the pet fawn cute and used as a vehicle for the boy's rite of passage into the brutal world of adults ...",1032048000,10,957,4.944099378881988
1343669,1,B00004RFHO,"Sorry to be out of tune with all the other reviewers, but I just didn't like ""The Yearling"" AT ALL. In fact, I was so turned off, I turned IT off. Now, I realize that not having seen the movie to its end makes my opinon less important than other folks', but I'll take that chance.
There are three main characters, the father, the mother, and the son. Let's start with the son. I didn't like his looks--something about him really irritated me. Perhaps it was his listless hair, perhaps it was the feeling that he had a perpetual runny nose, I dunno, something like that. Then there's the father, played by Gregory Peck. Personally, I think Peck had to mature into being a better actor. I believe he was given a lot of roles in his early movie career for which he lacked the depth to portray convincingly. Here, he's supposed to be an ex-Confederate who's trying to eke out a life on his Florida farm who has had to bury his older children. Peck is not at all convincing in this role; even his feigned Southern accent is poor. The only life experience I'm convinced he has had is having grown tall. I think Henry Fonda or Robert Mitchum would have been able to bring much more to this role. Now, Jane Wyman as the mother is a different story. I truly believe her as this embittered woman who has lost so many children that she cannot bear to risk her heart again on the last remaining boy. If the other two actors had been different, I would have stayed with the movie to find out what was going to happen to Wyman's character.
Maybe one day, when I have seen everything else that I ever wanted to see, I will steel myself to sit through ""The Yearling"" in its entirety, but not before then.",999388800,4,1688,4.3280757097791795
1343670,5,B00004RFHO,"Pretty strong endorsement. Well, I stand by it. This is one of the finest films ever made. Forget that this has a rep as a ""family film"". It is that. It is a wonderful film for children. But, it is also a film that can be fully appreciated by adults. It is simply beautiful and timeless. The Technicolor cinematography is simply stunning. The direction & performances first class.

The story of a backwoods couple in post Civil-War Florida, their only (surviving) child and his love for a Yearling fawn, and their friends & neighbors, is told simply with wit & humor, with compassion and sensitivity, and with subtlety to the undercurrents of emotion and feeling. A story of fun and sorrow, of the struggle for existence, of tragic necessity and loss and the redemptive power of love. Real life lessons served with some humility, sensitivity, and compassion, in a real setting, with natural and low-key performances punctuating the morals of the story nicely. And, YES, dammit, it'll choke you up.

Far superior to most of the tripe that passes for family films, this one holds up. Gregory Peck is funny & relaxed and wonderfully caring as the father, a performance in some ways more natural and deeper than his Oscar winning turn in To Kill a Mockingbird. Jane Wyman graduated to the big leagues of serious acting with her performance as the mother, wounded and fearing to love because of her previous losses of infants & toddlers. And Claude Jarmon is open-faced, honest and effective as Jody, a role that earned him a special Oscar.

The final speech about the joy & tragedy of life Peck gives to his son Jody was plagiarized and lifted almost word-for-word for the final similar speech in Disney's Old Yeller, a beloved film that today looks cheap and quickly and poorly made with terrible acting. Old Yeller might still work for little kids, but I can't imagine an adult sitting through it. The Yearling, in contrast, was made with an adult sensibility and it will remain richly rewarding for anyone.

I can't imagine anyone who feels human emotions and has had the pure joy of childhood freedom & adventure, and also faced awful decisions and tragic losses as child and adult not enjoying this film. As for the rest, well, nuff said. And, why in hell hasn't it been preserved on DVD!",999216000,15,2289,4.743718592964824
