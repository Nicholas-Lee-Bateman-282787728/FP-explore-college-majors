6040070,5,B00FYV7WCY,"Wow!!! This movie keeps you guessing.... Keeps your attention...
A little scary but not to bad... No nudety  or foul language, (which is rare these days)
 Glad I rented it, definitely worth watching! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!",1383350400,2,250,4.659090909090909
6040071,5,B00FYV7WCY,"great creepy movie! a little slow moving at first, but really ends nicely. you will get frusterated along with our heroine as you relive the same day over and over!",1383350400,,164,4.5
6040072,4,B00FYV7WCY,"I don't regret paying 6.99 at all for this rental. When it was over I felt like I had woken from a little nightmare. There is something ""classic"" about this movie but it's also unique. I had planned on carving a pumpkin while it played but the pumpkin just sat there and I didn't think about it once until the movie was over.

The film twisted a bit and then twisted some more and then it became a ""scary"" mystery. You don't have to wait until the end for some interesting twist  since it pretty much gets right to it, which I appreciated. I want to say that it dragged a bit once it was clear what was going on but the actress kept me interested. She's good and she made it REAL easy to care about the main character and I wanted to stay with her until she solved the mystery.

I know I am being vague but I was irritated to realize when I was watching the film that some reviews just gave too much away. It's not ""horror"" necessarily (is there such a thing as ""soft horror"" lol?) but it's scary in a sort of innocent way. I mean, there were some scary things if one just thought about being in the same scenario as her. It's creepy but it's not disgusting and it doesn't rely on easy jump-scares (cough cough.....The Conjuring) to CONSTANTLY rattle the viewer but it leans more on the viewer's imagination.

Again, it's a Good Movie.",1383004800,3,1335,4.264822134387352
6040073,4,B00FYV7WCY,"I have not seen a good movie in this genre in many, many years. Now, I have seen two within a few days. This movie and ""The Conjuring."" I hope there is a new trend in the genre. These type movies are generally lacking in the areas that matter the most, acting and writing, even if the underlying premise is pretty good.

""The Conjuring"" relies upon a premise that has been done to death. A family moves into a home possessed by an evil spirit and they must rid the home of the entity. ""Haunter"" takes a new twist on this type story and does a fairly decent job. Although the movie has an overall surreal effect that leaves the viewer in a somewhat confused daze, it continues to remain interesting. After this surreal effects dissipates, the movie becomes more of a thriller.

The acting, especially by the lead actress Abigail Breslin, is well done. Again, a rarity in these type movies.

Trying to write a movie like this, bringing multiple stories/phases/realities/whatever is not easy. This movie does ok in that department. At times I think the writing slagged and suffered a bit but it did not drag out. Overall, everything came together well.

No real special effects for this movie. This movie relies upon storytelling and acting. Audio and filming are excellent.

Family friendly: No nudity, no foul language. Murder is observed but not gruesome. I think the most unfriendly family parts would be the anger scenes but they are not too bad. This movie is ok to watch with young kids in the room, in my opinion,

This is not a scary movie but a nice Halloween selection for adults wanting a more quality type movie. ""The Conjuring"" is also a quality selection.

Normally, I would rate this movie with 3 stars, but because it rises above its class in genre and the makers seemed to care about the movie in general, it gets 4 stars.",1382832000,42,1837,4.5823170731707314
6040074,3,B00FYV7WCY,"After hearing about this movie, I was intrigued enough to rent it.  I'd call it a haunting from a different perspective; it earns kudos for its creativity.  Abigail Breslin does a good job with the main character, and while it's not a ""jump out of your seat"" kind of film, it is psychologically frightening.",1382832000,,307,4.666666666666667
6040075,4,B00FYV7WCY,"***** Contains plot spoiler that comes at 30 minutes into film...or not if you read the story line*****

Lisa (Abigail Breslin) wakes up as Bill Murray every morning ala ""Ground Hog Day"" in 1985. At 30 minutes into the film she also realizes she is Nicole Kidman from ""The Others."" (Sorry if you haven't seen that film.) It seems she is trapped inside the house with the ghost of a serial killer (Stephen McHattie) who is still active.

The film was done rather smartly. There is an error early on when mom (Samantha Weinstein) calls Robbie (Peter DaCunha) ""Buster Brown"" one day and then ""Charlie Brown"" the next day when the days are supposed to be identical. Bad editing that could have been changed with a simple voice over.

Lisa, being our main character and hero also provides us with the film target audience of young teen girls. The horror is mostly subtle. Although the guy is a serial killer, the film refrains from the gore aspect with ""intense"" scenes not being ""Hell Raiser""intense.

I watched this film without reading the storyline and found trying to figure out what was going on enjoyable. This is a film you might want to watch with the family without letting them read the story line.

Would make a great horror rental.

6040078,2,B00FYV7WCY,"I'm haunted.  My wish is that this movie was more than what it was.  From watching the trailer, this movie looked great and so I rented it for a whopping $6.99!  The plot (story) wasn't smart.  In fact, I was confused because the writers keep saying the same thing over and over.  I asked myself, what am I missing?  Is there something going on here that I need to figure out before moving on?  Is there something ""otherworldly""? NO, NO & NO!  The writers simply needed to fill the allotted time frame.  Consequently, I feel like I watched this movie five times in a row instead of once all the way through! I held out hope for a surprise ending.  There wasn't one.

To be crystal clear:  There are NO good parts. No twists or turns, no surprises, no jumps or screams, no cover your eyes, no blood, no gore, no, no, no....whatever you're looking for - you'll not find it here.  I'm not sure why this is classified as horror.

Abigail Breslin's name caught my eye also and I don't mean to be cruel and won't harp on this.  I just wanted to tell her to go home, give it up...there is no saving this story - it's horrible.  I've seen Ms. Breslin in roles where she shines - this isn't one of those roles.

I'm being extremely generous with my rating.

It starts off as a weird kind of ghostly version of Bill Murray's Groundhogs day, and then slowly evolves into a murder homicide mystery. Then it transforms for the last half of the movie, into a straight up, suspense, action movie! There's even (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) a scene in the plot where a currently living girl, summons the main character, plans to have her posses her, and records a modern day version of the, ""Save my family, you're my only hope!"" message for the main character to find. All while exploring a future she doesn't understand.
The characters are amazing, and well written. This film is just like every true epic journey, it starts off kind of slow and in a weird place. But by the end, you will be screaming, ""HELL YEA!!"" and cheering  the heroine on! So fantastic!!!!!",1465430400,3,816,4.706293706293707

6040092,5,B00FYV7WCY,"I had stayed away from contemporary horror movies for a while since many of them are rather generic and insipid. However, there have been some exceptions - I enjoyed films like BABADOOK, MAMA, and a few others that were unique and compelling. HAUNTER popped up in my Netflix list as a recommended watch and after seeing that Abigail Breslin was in it, I thought, ""Why not?"" As it turns out, this proved to be one of the best horror films I have seen in a while with a plot that is complex and with plenty of scares within.

Abigail Breslin plays Lisa Johnson, who lives with her family comprising mom, dad, and younger brother Robbie. At the beginning of the film, the family is portrayed as living indoors for a while, with Lisa's dad trying to fix their car so that the family can go out, although there's a thick fog outside that prevents them from leaving the house. Over a period of time, the same scenes play out: Lisa's mom asks her to do the laundry, serves the same meal, and the same family routines are played out over and over in a twisted take of GROUNDHOG DAY. Lisa eventually realizes that her family is dead and that she alone has ""awakened"". The malevolent entity that has caused their deaths warns Lisa to just stay quiet and pretend she is still asleep, and cautions her that bad things will happen if she tries to contact anyone else.

Lisa realizes that there are others like her, trapped in the house, and worse, there's a girl living in the present day with her family in the same house who is still very much alive, but who is in mortal danger. The rest of the story focuses on how Lisa tries to help not only the living family, but also to help her and the rest of the dead, trapped souls to escape the confines of the haunted house and the evil entity that resides within.

This is one of those multi-layered horror films that puts a unique spin on the haunted house genre. It is refreshing to see films like this are still being made, which bodes well for the contemporary horror genre. I recommend this for any horror fan who enjoys a well-told haunted house story that chills the bones.",1442102400,,2115,4.417948717948718

She has an incredible face for horror, one that is able to somehow radiantly express fear and distress without ever overplaying it. She has incredible emotional control. It's not until minute 55 of the movie, I'm pretty sure, that she ever cracks a smile, and when she does it's a pretty brilliant sight.
I'm still a little confused by people's obsession with nudity and ""F-bombs."" Because of their absence, people are touting this movie as something wholesome for the whole family to enjoy. There are images of death here I would have found quite disturbing as a kid, but somehow that doesn't matter as much as a couple swears and the occasional exposed nipple?

6040112,4,B00FYV7WCY,"I know it's a little late for Halloween, but I've yet to watched any indie Thanksgiving or Christmas movies, at least not lately.  So, here's Haunter...

  Most indie films are not rated.  That is because it costs $3,000 to submit a movie to the MPAA to get the film rated.  Most Indie movies have very low budgets, and they have to use all of that towards the making of the movie.  Unfortunately, a lot of Indie filmmakers have exploited this and put a bunch of garbage in many of the Indie films, so they've gotten a bad rap.  There are some good ones out there, though.  Haunter would be a PG-13 not because of cuss words, nudity, or violence, but more just because it's a scary movie.

  Haunter is one of the better Indie Horror movies I've seen.  Mac Carter gives us an interesting spin on Horror.  If you read the cover, netflix description, or IMDB review, you'll learn that the protagonist, Lisa (played by Abigail Breslin ), is the ghost.  So I don't feel like I'm giving too much of  a spoiler by giving that much away.

  Lisa is stuck in a time loop.  She lives the same boring day over and over.  There are strange interruptions which become more frequent, though; banging on the walls, strange noises, stuff missing, usual haunting-type activity.  She also sees a creepy girl every now-and-then.  She wants to get away, but her repeated attempts gain her nothing.  It's foggy outside, and she leaves only to find herself walking back towards the house.  Her parents also tell her not to go out because of the weather, and you get the feeling that they know something more than what they are saying.

  One day, things change dramatically.  Her family is completely different.  Her dad is abusive, which is completely different from the loving father he was before.  Her mother plays the part of the abused wife.  Lisa is more than upset by all of this.  She tries to figure out what is going on, and tries to contact the little girl she keeps seeing.

  Then her world is shattered as she finds out what is really going on in her house.

  The movie has some startling moments where you might jump in your seat a bit.  There is really no gore, blood, or guts (though there is a scene where people rot, like dead corpses, in a matter of seconds). But there is nothing too scary about it.  The story line is really good, and the actors, especially Abigail, are actually really good, too.

  I would recommend to almost anyone who wants a bit of a thrill without staying up all night in fear of monsters getting you in your sleep.",1416787200,,2542,4.480263157894737

6040121,4,B00FYV7WCY,"WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Lisa is a young girl who is about to turn sixteen, except not, because she and her family keep re-living the day before her birthday, over and over, and only Lisa is aware that anything is wrong. Unable to leave the house or make a phone call, Lisa must struggle to figure out what's going on and if there's any way to break the cycle.

WHAT IT HAS GOING FOR IT: It's a lot smarter than most ghost stories, and although it's pretty tame as far as horror films go (thriller is a better qualifier, but we've got dead people and spirits here, so it gets classified as horror), it makes up for its lack of scares with a compelling puzzle of a plot. Even when the pieces start to get put together, the movie keeps tension in the action.

WHAT IT HAS AGAINST IT: Aside from it's awful title, our lead actress does an admittedly lukewarm job with her role, although I get the feeling that's more the result of the direction than her lack of talent. Also, like most ghost stories, this story suffers from a severe case of Deus Ex Ghost-ina, wherein things are solved because of some kind of weird set of rules governing the afterlife that the audience is never really privy to. Finally, the movie ends about five minutes after it should just so it can tack on an ending that's almost unforgivably hokey, right down to it's last whispered word of dialogue.

OVERALL: The flaws are admittedly minor considering how rare it is to find well done scary movies these days. This one is quirky enough to sustain interest but not so weird that it goes totally over the head, and the script parcels out its answers with nearly perfect pacing. And even if you can figure out what's going on before the film reveals its secrets, some good performances (especially by our bad guy and Lisa's father) and some solidly spooky atmospherics keeps things spicy.",1409529600,,1851,4.502976190476191

As a ghost she must communicate with the present day living to prevent the continuing cycle of murders induced by an evil spirit played by Canadian actor Stephen McHattie.  Interesting premise as Lisa a benevolent ghost is haunted by both the evil spirit and the living.  The muddled ending is somewhat inconclusive.  This Canadian production is set in a house that transfigures through different time periods.  Though atmospheric, I never was really scared as this is not a blood and gore tale.

6040131,2,B00FYV7WCY,"To try and describe this movie, it's not that easy for me without giving away spoilers, but put it this way, it's kind of something like ""The Others"" meets ""Nightmare on Elm St"" with a bit of a ""Ground Hog Day"" situation (situation, nothing like the movie).

Abigail Breslin plays a rather borderline emo teenager who discovers things are not quite around the house or with her life. She's finding herself waking up everyday to the same thing. The film centers around her and her parents, and her little brother who as she uncovers things, realizes a secret they have not figured out yet. Without trying to give too much away, she ends up finding a way to communicate with a girl from the past, and another from the future. However, don't think Back To The Future or anything, it's not about time traveling. That will make some sense if you have seen the film. In order for things to turn out for the best, she has to find out what is going on, and who is behind it?

There are parts of this movie that are pretty confusing, but by the time it's finished, everything comes together and makes sense... sort of. There are plenty of questions left to ask, but I won't go into them by mentioning them here, as they would be spoilers.

What isn't a spoiler is saying the way you expect the film to go in, doesn't quite go there, and perhaps thats why there is quite a lot of negative votes and reviews about this film. So much of it either doesn't make sense, or it's creating it's own film laws that people have seen so many times in other movies and feel this one's laws it's creating are going against previous ones that stood out well.

It's an odd tale... but it's in no way a horror film. It's more just a bit of a thriller, but more along the lines of a spooky ... kids movie? It also reminded me a bit of a few PG rated ghost shows of the past. Horror and gore fans will have absolutely no interest in this, unless you kind of want to see a really out there re-telling of Freddy Kruger?

In the end, I didn't hate it, but I did not like it either. It's somewhere in between. It's filmed well, the effects are ok, the acting is alright, there is nothing really say against the production of the film... it's just, not a strong enough story to make me want to ever see it again. It's not a keeper. It's a rental/dl, see it once, and so be it. There is little to nothing much memorable or would be considered something added to classic moments in cinema. So, just see it if it interests you, but I would not recommend buying it first.",1402012800,,2534,4.270833333333333

6040133,3,B00FYV7WCY,"This was a good ghost story with a twist, but nothing really original. The premise was already done in The Others. Without giving away too much, it's a haunting from the Ghost's perspective.

The quality of production is very, very good. Excellent, actually. The movie had an acceptable ending although I really believe that 90% of Movie Makers need to go back to ""the grade school of how to end stuff"". I almost feel like the majority of movies that I watch have endings that were just ""thrown in there"" for lack of a plan. This is no exception, but it is one of the better endings.

All in All I gave it 3 stars because it's a good movie, entertaining, acceptable to spend a few dollars on to rent.

After all was said and done, I have to admit the story telling was top notch and kept me engrossed the entire movie.  A movie like this is refreshing to this genre in the fact that the way the story plays out and the way the screenplay was written was well thought out.

This movie did not rely on any overdone CGI effects or the 'scare' factor to tell a good story about the supernatural.  If only more movies in the supernatural genre were more like this!  Well done!!!",1400976000,2,550,4.25

This actually turned out to be an impressive little thriller all from the Ghost-girl, Lisa's perspective. Once she regains consciousness and realizes that while Living-girl, Olivia might have discovered the killer, only Lisa can solve and deal with the situation literally from the other side.

This was a wildly imaginative movie, by far a much more intelligent film than most of the action-packed, blockbusters out there. And the originality of this story should make the film relevant for years to come.",1400284800,2,746,5.056910569105691

The twist this time is that it takes from the perspective of the ghost and her struggle to save the next girl and her family from dying in a similar fashion she did by someone who is already dead himself. Abigail Breslin gives a great performance and really carries this movie...with a lesser actress it would have been mediocre at best.

6040138,5,B00FYV7WCY,I rented this film on a whim at my local movie store. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. The movie is slow building and there is almost no gore in it at all. I would say stay away if you are into the slasher blood and guts movies for this film is not. Haunter is old school in the sense that it delivers a great story and creates an eerie feel and mood through out its entire length. The heroine of the film is a young girl and this quickly reminded me of some of the more familiar horror movies from the 80s. The movie is repetitive at the beginning and takes a little bit of time to get you into what exactly is going on. Abigail Breslin is really terrific in this movie! She displays so much potential to be a huge movie star especially as she gets older that one cannot comprehend how she isn't already.

6040146,4,B00FYV7WCY,"Though the cover and title look pretty run-of-the-mill, this Canadian production goes in some unexpected directions, starting slowly and repetitively but gradually accelerating to make an ultimately satisfying show. Abigail Breslin gives a nice performance as protagonist Lisa, as does Stephen McHattie as ""the Pale Man."" The remaining cast are also quite good. It's set in the mid 80s, which de-complicates things as there's no internet or text messages. The plot is simple but original, with some interesting twists and time paradoxes. I've noticed some comparisons of this film with ""The Others"" and certain others, but it's still quite different from many of the schlock-fests we're getting today. Still, it's low budget and a bit half-baked--to be fair, maybe 3/4-baked. I would have liked more specific revelations about the other families, victims, and the whole mythos behind the Pale Man, but oh well.

HAUNTER is an interesting cross-blend of genres: It's something of a ""family horror film."" There is, however, some gore, death imagery, and generally disturbing, scary material, so it's not appropriate for really young children: Most preteens or older can probably handle it. Despite being pretty clean--nothing excessive in the areas mentioned, no nudity, some mild and realistic profanity--HAUNTER succeeds in being genuinely tense and frightening. I don't want to give too much away, but it ends differently from your average horror fare and in a way that many people, I would guess, will like.",1395792000,6,1509,5.367088607594937

While this movie may start off a little slow, those scenes accelerate into a complex interplay of stories within stories. This is not your usual fast Hollywood action movie that plays from a straight chronological time frame. You will appreciate this movie IF you yourself understand some complexities that exist within the supernatural worlds.

This story shows alternate realities after one is ""dead"" (eg. ""boring"" time loops, historical replays, etc.), the reality of psychometry among the dead and the living, and the fleeting connections made between spirits and the living.

I wanted to like this film but from the first ten minutes, there were a myriad of reasons why I shouldn't. The film works against itself, often establishing moderately atmospheric chills squandered by ridiculous anti climactic payoffs and ideas that folded over and on top of themselves so many times that you can't even be sure anymore whether or not the director knew what was going on. Abigail Breslin is reliably good, however awkward coming into her own as a teenage star. Not much can be said for the rest of the cast - most of which I feel were horribly wrong for their roles. Haunter boasted some truly teriffic ideas and themes but it just couldn't figure out what to do with any of them and ended up tossing them into a soup of boiling, bubbling, atmospheric, smoggy s***.

Been done before, but not too often, of leaving the viewer in suspense as to who is ghost dead and who is alive and which viewpoint is the one we are watching from. A bit more backstory on who died and who did it would have helped as well as a little more clarity and flow (too jumbled) as to how the mismatch of dead and alive characters connected with each other.  You almost needed to chart/map people, locations and times to have the story flow comfortable forward.

6040158,4,B00FYV7WCY,"Is this the greatest horror movie ever filmed? No. But it needs to be seen because it goes for creep and nuance as opposed to all out assault on the viewer's sensibilities.

Here's the scoop. Lisa (Abigail Breslin) and her family are stuck in a loop but only she seems to know it. As far as her father, mother and brother are concerned, each day is a brand new day. So how is it she seems to be the only one who knows and can she do anything about it?

This is a very watchable film. It has a creepy storyline and it's directed in such a way as to maintain the creep factor. The constant fog, the same people saying and doing the same things over and over, day after day is disconcerting. I liked that there were no jump scares used. This is more of a slow burn.  It does borrow a few things from other sources, but it's a smart dog who knows its owner so I can forgive it for that. But the clues build as to how all this came about and it has a satisfying ending.

The acting is ranges from good to really good. Breslin is maturing as an actress and she's growing into her face. She doesn't look as gorpy as she did a few years ago.

On the downside is the Stephen McHattie character. It's a bit overplayed. Too much the boogie man. Also, some of the framing techniques in a few shots, though good, were a bit overused. And some of the story aspects didn't fit for me. Either I  missed it or they weren't presented well enough.

6040159,4,B00FYV7WCY,"To an adult horrorhound this may be more interesting than satisfying; teen angst meets PG-13 family-friendly horror and cleverly surreal storytelling in this highly original film.

This film approaches an all too familiar idea (i.e., a haunted house story) from a new perspective.  On an inordinately foggy day we meet Lisa (Abigail Breslin).  In many ways Lisa is the prototypical American teen--moody, attitudinal, and her parents just don't get her.  But in one way she's not like the typical teen: she and her family are reliving the same day of their life over and over again and Lisa is the only one who sees what's happening or has any idea why.

Creative shots illustrate the seclusion of their house in the fog and their boringly repetitive life/day.  The same mac and cheese for lunch--every day, the same conversation with her mother--every day, the same episode of Murder She Wrote every night--every day this Groundhog Day  scenario has been wearing on Lisa's patience and sanity alike.  But one day strange things start happening around the house and Lisa's angsty teen life becomes a little more interesting.

Slamming doors, strange sounds, voices, shadows and secret doors; it seems that Lisa's house is haunted and only Lisa knows it.  But there's something very different about this haunting

To say much more would ruin this movie and, honestly, most reviews and trailers risk giving away the well-crafted surprises that makes this story so original.

The scares are hardly as ""scary"" as your typical jump scares--hardly startling to the seasoned horrorhound making it feel very much the humble PG-13 that it is.  I'd go so far as to call this movie family-friendly.  There is also no gore, nudity or profanity.  This film relies entirely on Lisa's perception and the surreal storytelling that ebbs and flows around her.

Director Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Splice) does a fine job here making a more ""wholesome"" horror film, but I feel that this entry to the genre will be lost on most mature horror-goers unless they're looking for something non-Disney to watch with their kids.  Natali has had a lot of experience as a storyboard artist (Ginger Snaps, Johnny Mnemonic, Eek the Cat and the Beetlejuice cartoon, to name the freaky and oddball work) and his mind is designed to form twisted, weird, slapstick, moral-testing, brutal scenarios.  I applaud this work and respect it.  However, I look forward to his future endeavors aimed more for lovers of gore, tension and, well, ""horror.""",1392595200,,2504,5.033980582524272

Once you realize that, some of the thrill is gone. Still o.k. and a worthy rental.",1386979200,,497,4.354838709677419
6040177,4,B00FYV7WCY,"More thriller than horror, this one has a story worth watching. The movie relies more on plot and acting than special effects and gore. Beware, the tempo relatively slow and  you are unlikely to be truly scared at any point, but the mood is tense and the story good.",1386288000,,266,4.428571428571429
6040178,5,B00FYV7WCY,"I will definitely be watching this again! I was so surprised by the low reviews this had on IMDb. This deserves at least an 8/10. This is a great mystery thriller that has Natali's signature style all over it. I absolutely love the cinematography in this and his other films. It was shot beautifully. Even though most of the reviewers said this movie was not scary, I found it to be very creepy and somewhat disturbing in some scenes. Abigail Breslin gives a fantastic performance in this. I was very impressed. Wouldn't be surprised if she gets an Oscar someday. Very entertaining, good story, good acting from all and very good writing as well. I went in with low expectations and they were surpassed on all levels. Highly Recommended!",1385856000,2,737,4.72093023255814

All in all it was an interesting concept. I would not by ANY means say that I loved it, but it was.....interesting. I wish they delved more into the background of the family, and women who where killed. That disappointed me. And I found myself rolling my eyes a few times throughout. It could have been better. I would not advise you to spend money on this, but perhaps wait until you can watch it for free if you have a prime membership.",1385769600,6,586,4.1946902654867255

Not the helpless female who needs rescuing.  A hero in her own right.  Loved this movie.  Yes, the end is a wee bit lame.  No way around it.  Doesn't matter because the film moves very well and figuring out what happened and what is happening aren't always the same thing.  You feel her frustration and terror.  You are proud of her.

6040187,4,B00FYV7WCY,"I recently watched ""The Conjuring"" for the first time and was very disappointed.  Maybe it was because it was around Halloween and I'd just binged on horror movies, but I could not dismiss the movie's cliches the way other viewers/reviewers could. The bright spot about ""Haunter"" is that it actually tries to be original.  One, it relies on the story and not cheap thrills for its effectiveness; there are very few graphic images.  Two, it turns the table on traditional haunted house tales by making the ghosts the ones who are haunted.

Abigail Breslin very nicely plays Lisa, a girl who must constantly relive the day before her 16th birthday in her family home with her parents and little brother.  Every day the four of them go through the same motions and engage in most of the same dialogue.  Only Lisa seems to be aware of this. Still, she doesn't know what happened to cause it, or how to change it. During Lisa's quest to unlock the mystery, she discovers that she and her family are not alone in the house.  Through her contact with ""the other side"" she manages to uncover the secrets the house holds and, despite dire warnings, sets out to free her family and break the cycle of haunting.

Because the movie wins points for originality and storytelling, I'm not docking it for its flaws of which there are many, but none that aren't typical of the genre.  There are a lot of plot elements that don't make sense.  I can't delve deeply into them without giving too much away.  One issue is that the limits of what ghosts can and can't do and the plights that they're susceptible to are fluid throughout the movie.  Basically, because of the film's pretty original premise, it was able to make its own rules; unfortunately, they're more penciled in than in ink.

There were also a few times when I wanted to fast forward.  The audience is clued in very early on -- in the first 10 minutes -- to the key plot point.  So then we, like Lisa and her family, are forced to go through the motions of reliving the same day over and over again.

The ending is anticlimactic and because of the overall shortage of shocking images, it does seem a little simplistic -- like more of a made-for-TV movie than one that was made for the theatres. But I did watch it on my TV so that worked out okay.  I wasn't really ever ""scared"", although the movie is creepy at times.  To me, ""Haunter"" is at its core about the art of crafting a good ghost story, and in my opinion, the art of good storytelling is what's been missing from most horror movies lately that have scared me, but have relied on special effects and graphic images to do so.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual fare.",1384041600,,2685,4.465163934426229

6040189,5,B00FYV7WCY,I really enjoyed Breslin taking on a meaty role and carrying an entire dramatic film almost single handedly. She is a force to be reckoned with for her future in film. It wasn't too shabby a ghost story either. I think the editing alone makes this film unsettling and worth your time. Who is haunting who is the question? Take a peek!,1383782400,,334,4.403225806451613
8619526,5,B00FYV7WCY,"I watched this movie expecting a run of the mill haunted house story, intelligent teenage girl investigates paranormal mystery in her home, dealing with an obnoxious brother and disbelieving parents. There would be some ghost, some past wrong that the girl would right, and while there would be some thrills and chills, it would almost be the horror movie equivalent of comfort food.

I was quite wrong! Almost from the very beginning there were nods to the typical tropes of such films but also some very quick subversions of these tropes. To go into too much detail is to spoil things, but it was quite unlike any horror film I have seen before.

The main actress, Abigail Breslin playing Lisa, really carried the film though all the actors/characters including the villain were very well done (menacingly played by Stephen McHattie). I really have nothing but praise for this film, one of the finest horror films I have seen in a while (maybe paranormal is the better term, as it isn't gory though there are deaths in the film, past deaths anyway, and definitely a lot of ghosts). The pacing was excellent, there was a real sink-your-teeth-into-him villain, the tension was great at the end, and there were many twists and turns in a struggle against the villain, the villain doing a fantastic job of showing the main character the stakes. Just a first-rate film!",1529884800,,1366,4.833333333333333

8619531,3,B00FYV7WCY,"I always go into a movie hoping to like it, but I left this one kind of bored.

There are a lot of things going on with this movie and I don't think they fit together cohesively. It tries to be a little bit of everything from 'The Others' to 'Groundhog Day' to part student film to some mystery thriller. First introduces time repeating itself, and then it forgets to do that halfway through.

Have you ever sat down to watch something and you sometimes pause a lot for certain movies? Being a film geek, I don't ever do thisunless the movie isn't getting my attention. I must've paused and revisited this movie about three times before I could finish it. I even played it on half my screen while organizing computer files on the other half. That's how uninterested I was.

I think there was a decent idea at play here, but the overall assembly of the movie needed to be put together by a team with more experience. The cinematography was good though!",1487289600,,951,4.422857142857143
