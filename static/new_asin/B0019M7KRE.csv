3440621,5,B0019M7KRE,"I watched this Concert DVD last night and really enjoyed all the different interpretations of Jimi's music.

The opening three cuts had young blues guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd tearing up the fretboards. He did a really great job on all three cuts, fingers flashing at light speed. Backed by Double Trouble's Tommy Shannon on Bass and Chris Layton on drums made it even better. Noah Hunt produced a very accurate vocal as compared to Jimi.

It really gives you an appreciation for Hendrix's talent to watch other performers play his stuff. Hendrix always looked so laid back when he played with his fingers effortlessly moving across  his guitar. Everybody did their own thing however you could see the effort that they had to put into it to match Hendrix's originals.

Indigenous's guitarist Mato Nanje and band equally performed at high frequency on the next cut, ""Hear My Train A Comin'"".

Living Colour provided the next two spectacular performances of ""Power of Soul"" and
""Crosstown Traffic"".

Eric Gales tore up the guitar with his version of ""Purple Haze"", gum and all.

Then enter the next group of artists including Jimmy Lane, Hubert Sumlin and Double Trouble, phenomenal.

Enter Paul Rogers(Mr Frontman Extraordinaire), Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Kenny Olson and one of my favorites Andy Aledort. What a thing of beauty.

And finally into the home stretch enter Mr Personality and the highlight in my opinion, Buddy Guy. He cuts into a few tunes with Andy, Hubert, double trouble and then the complete ensemble. The highlight was when Buddy traded with Hubert Sumlin, a couple of oldtimers, blues giants just strutting their stuff while interacting with the audience. Real story telling at it's best.

I never even got into the bonus features as it was past my bedtime and I had also just watched Muddy Waters and Rolling Stones, Live in Chicago from 1981. Another must have concert DVD. I'm saving the bonus features for this evening, Hmmm, Robert Randolph and Double trouble, Mick Taylor and Indigenous, and Eric Gales, Billy Cox and Buddy Miles. What other surprises await for me to uncover, looking forward to it.

I loved it from A to Z and give it a capital thumbs up. Go for it, you won't regret it.",1348272000,4,2219,4.875
3440622,5,B0019M7KRE,"From the parts I saw on youtube it seems cool. However, since I have a terrible seller and have yet to receive it almost 2 months after purchase....don't know.",1302134400,,159,4.517241379310345
3440623,2,B0019M7KRE,"I recently had an opportunity to see the show live in Richmond, Va.  I purchased this DVD thinking it might be fairly close to the quality of the show I saw in person.  I was wrong! This DVD is outdated, and rather poorly done.  I wished ""they"" had taped the show I witnessed--it was an awesome non-stop show featuring top quality guitarist from beginning to end!  Producer: Please take the hint!  It's time for a newer ""Hendrix Experience"" DVD.",1293840000,3,445,4.582278481012659
3440624,5,B0019M7KRE,"This is one hot DVD!!  Performed by world class artists who are all famous in their own right, you know they themselves have to be Hendrix junkies to perform like this.  Ignore the many ""Foo Foo"" reviewers who like to nit pick according to their own personal prejudices, just trust me... if you are a Hendrix junkie then before you have finished viewing this DVD you will fall to your knees in praise of this historic tribute to Hendrix.  It's that good!!  OMG !!  Lay your hand on the DVD and say, ""Hey man!!!""",1259798400,,511,4.3936170212765955
3440625,4,B0019M7KRE,"Watch this for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd performances, he entertains the best of anyone that performed, and played long distortion-heavy solos--well prepared guitarist and Noah Hunt of Double Trouble delivered good vocals.  Indigeneous blew me away with Hear My Train A Comin', Naje can really play guitar.  Living Color was a disappointment with their take on Power Of Soul, too much Corey Glover and not enough guitar.  They somewhat redeemed themselves on Crosstown Traffic, but here again, Glover's grandstanding almost ruined the song--guess he thought the performance was about himself.  We had to tolerate 3 minutes of him running to the back of the auditorium then up the stairs just so he could show us that his fat ass could do it.  At one point, one of the band members could be heard asking "" where's Corey?""--guess he didn't tell anyone that he was leaving the stage.  Eric Gales has a lousy voice for singing Hendrix and so I'll pass on his takes on Purple Haze & Foxey Lady, but his guitar playing was good.  Humbert Sumlin is a blues legend and I'm glad that he was included in several of the performances, though it was Jimmy Lane who gave us the goods on Killing Floor & Bleeding Heart.  I wanted Rodgers to deliver on Stone Free but I think his vocals were just average and the band missed an opportunity to do an extended solo--Maybe Kenny Olson wasn't up to it.  I love Buddy Guy and have almost all of his recordings but watch this DVD for his interactions with Sumlin not for his playing.  Sumlin and Guy have been life long friends and their presence together on stage is one of the reasons to watch this video.  Randolph's pedal steel guitar rendition of Purple Haze was great, but Mick Taylor playing a 13 minute version of Red House with Indigenous is the best reason to watch the bonus vids.

I'm a hard grader, so 4 stars is good for me.",1254614400,12,1865,4.5843373493975905
3440626,4,B0019M7KRE,There were enough good performances that if you're a Hendrix fan in any way it is worth it to get this video. If you're not old enough to have seen the real thing this is as close as you'll get.,1237507200,3,194,3.875
3440627,4,B0019M7KRE,"This was a great idea, to bring together all the famous Hendrix disciples out there and use their collective talents to pay tribute to the greatest guitarist of all time. And it's great--outstanding performances. They picked perfect guys for the concert, but I would have included Doyle Bramhall II, whose guitar sound has been compared to Hendrix's.

The main weakness of the concert was the ensemble jam at the end on Voodoo Child. Kenny Olson started it off, the great Paul Rodgers belted out the vocals, and then time for the guitar solo......NOTHING. Nobody would take a solo! You got 5-6 hotshot Hendrix offshoots up there and nobody wants to solo on Voodoo Child? I guess nobody wanted to step on each other's toes. It just should have been rehearsed better, is my guess.

Also, nobody made much use of the whammy bar or guitar feedback in their performances. C'mon guys! Those were two of Jimi's main trademarks!

Those are my only gripes, though. Indigenous gave a strong performance, as did Kenny Wayne Shepherd. And then Living Colour came on and just blew everybody away--amazing performance from the entire band! Eric Gales followed them with a strong showing, but Living Colour's set was so over the top that they should have been the last to go on.

OK, one more thing....during the ensemble jam on Voodoo Child, I noticed one  of the players....who is that? Is it....I think it is--Kid Rock himself! (I'm not 100% sure, but I think it was him.) No leads from him or anything, but I think it would have been cool to have such a popular figure to step up to the mic and belt out a verse in his own style to surprise the crowd, instead of just standing there playing rhythm guitar in the background.

Overall, though, a recommended DVD for all Hendrix fans!",1225324800,14,1770,4.67524115755627

8274538,5,B0019M7KRE,"The two (2) songs on this video that stand out to me are: 1.) Kenny Wayne Shepherd- I Don't Live Today and 2.) Eric Gales-Purple Haze It's funny because some of the music from Kenny Wayne Shepherd's albums I like, but some not so much. Same thing with Eric Gales. Both of them are excellent guitar players in their own right, but not everything that they do appeals to me. However, to me their covers of each of the Hendrix tunes really define the spirit of Hendrix in a way I've rarely seen or heard other than listening to the master himself. But hey, all  of the musicians on this video are great musicians. Check it out and see who's interpretation(s) of his songs you like best.",1482969600,,683,4.377952755905512
