8386994,5,B0031IABRK,"GHOULTOWN'S MISTRESS OF THE DARK CD/DVD combo set is an excellent tribute to the ledengary horror hostess, icon, and glamour-ghoul ELVIRA!!!!! I'm a colossal ELVIRA fan and of the extremely kind, funny, and wonderfully talented actress Cassandra Peterson who happens to portray this character. The bands homage song is appropriately entitles MISTRESS OF THE DARK and is an energetic anthem that solidifies this Vamp's place in music history. Musically it possesses a Rockabilly/Southern rock feel to it and has an interesting energy to it that I think will strangly crossover to her incredibly diverse fanbase. The songs definitive masculine vocal urgency spews at times almost banshee like the bewitching pleasantries of this dazzeling cartoon-like fantasy figure that make up our beloved ""Hostess with the Mostess""! I completely dig the song and love the crescendo with the all male chours wailing the ""Queen of Halloween""'s praises! The CD's has two killer dance remixes of the song and three other non ELVIRA numbers by the band. The DVD features a unique music video of the song shot at the legendary Magic Castle in Los Angeles Ca. with ELVIRA driving up in her fabulous Macabre Mobile; the video also features GHOULTOWN (of course), and a rather lengthy as well as interesting featurette that fans will surely devour. Unfortunately the ELVIRA character has been hugely underused by the film and music establishments and GHOULTOWN gives her a rockin anthem worthy of her that's long overdue. Hopefully we'll see this wonderful witchy woman in one last feature film before she retires, and maybe she'll record somemore of her campy Halloween tunes as well. I completely recomend GHOULTOWN'S MISTRESS OF THE DARK CD/DVD combo set for fans of both artists, and glad ELVIRA is finally getting her do in song - UNPLEASANT DREAMS !!!!!",1269561600,3,1835,5.1610738255033555
