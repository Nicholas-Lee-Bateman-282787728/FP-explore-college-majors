8046083,5,B0007989IO,"I loved this show back when I was in high school, and this volume (the final one to complete my collection) has some classics. The Black Lightning - Irvine getting his Lightning Saix. Such a great episode. This series isn't perfect, but it is great. It makes me think of a very promising film student's work. It could use some polishing, but it shows so much promise, and its great moments are just superb. Also, I love the music direction. Atmosphere. This show has loads of it. It could easily have been just about giant animal-shaped robots duking it out, but it's so much more.",1412553600,,581,4.542857142857143

This series is really fun. There are lots of cool characters, action, drama, comedy, and a pretty engrossing plot. I'd say that this series borders on addicting. When it was on TV at 5:30 in the morning all those years ago, I actually woke up, watched it, and went back to sleep before going to high school at 8am. It takes a hell of a good show to get me up that early in the morning. The only complaint I have is the price. I started collecting Zoids when it was first coming out. It seems like the DVD's were around $10 or $15 new back then. I've seen the prices of them now, and I think it's ridiculous. They are out of print, and there are more and more people that will hold on to them once they get them. If you find a decent deal on them, I'd jump on it. It looks like the whole series will run about $700. I would like to see them released again since they are rare. Anyway, this series is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1354924800,,1175,4.1535087719298245
8046086,3,B0007989IO,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.

ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste.",1167523200,,788,3.9559748427672954
