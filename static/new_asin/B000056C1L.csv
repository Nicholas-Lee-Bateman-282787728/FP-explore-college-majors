7931894,5,B000056C1L,"Just buy this.  It's NOVA and if you're interested in the archaeology of Mayan sites, it's a must have.  The video version I purchased was produced by WGBH-PBS Boston and included two disc:  Lost King of the Maya (2001), and Mayan Lords of the Jungle (1981)",1438905600,,257,4.543478260869565
7931895,4,B000056C1L,"The Lost King film was excellent and hat a lot of interesting information. I would give it 5 stars. It was filmed in 2001. The second film, Maya Lords was very good and interesting, but filmed in 1981 so there may be more current information. The filming was less sophisticated than more recent films but it was well done. I'd give it 4 stars.",1396310400,,343,4.375
7931896,5,B000056C1L,"This 2 DVD set includes ""Lost King of the Maya"", which is focused on a search for a King of Copan, Honduras, named Yax K'uk Mo. ""Maya Lords of the Jungle"", which follows the deciphering of the Mayan language in the Maya area which includes the states of Chiapas and Yucatan in Southern Mexico, Guatemala (Tikal), El Salvador and Belize.
I have visited  all the major Maya cities through the years and followed the impressive progress in understanding the Maya language. The Spanish priests who accompanied Cortez to the new world burned almost all the Maya books, labeling them as work of the devil. In the years since, scholars have made great progress in deciphering the Maya writing system. The Maya people still live in the lowland rain forests in Mexico and Central America today.",1384819200,,785,4.814814814814815
7931897,4,B000056C1L,"In one sense, this is an odd pairing. The first film is far more recent (2001). It is a superb study of the early Maya and Mayan archaeology in Copan, Honduras. The film deals especially with the dynasty of King Yax K'uk Mo, hallucinogenic vision quests, ritual warfare, human sacrifice - the works. These are major aspects of Mayan civilization but were little known and even less spoken of until near the end of the twentieth century.
The second film, if I remember the credits correctly, was something like 1981, It is an overview of Mayan archeology and what we knew of the Mayan's at that time. Well done, and a good, though dated, overview, this film also intelligently examines the complex problem of the Mayan collapse and sites reasons why it was likely not the simple depletion of local resources that it was once thought to be.
I believe this two-CD set is the best I've yet seen on the subject. Being a teacher, I feel the need to note that both films are suitable for history or art classrooms - esp. high school or college level but could be appropriate for jr. high as well.",1329609600,4,1089,4.532994923857868
7931898,4,B000056C1L,"This documentary only covers one king, king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' who lived in Copan, today's Honduras. Unbelievable how the archaeologists decoded the Mayan hieroglyphics!",1196294400,,172,5.92
7931899,4,B000056C1L,An oustanding example of what NOVA does very well.  Beautifully photographed -the film gives you a sense that you have actually been to Copan. Top of their field scholars and a dramatic storyline of the Mayan City State.,1195862400,9,220,4.7894736842105265
7931900,5,B000056C1L,"This NOVA presentation, which originally aired on PBS on February 13, 2001, takes us 1600 years back in time, to Copan, ""the Athens of Central America.""  Here, an ancient Mayan civilization flourished for four hundred years, leaving behind a wealth of stone-carved hieroglyphics we have only recently been able to begin translating (thanks in no small part to those Spanish priests that burned every Mayan book they could get their hands on).  The Mayans are a fascinating people, having built a culture of great scientific, particularly astronomical, achievement while, at the same time, practicing a religion awash in blood.  These are the guys who ripped sacrificial victims' beating hearts out of their chests and beheaded the losers of their ancient ballgames.  You just can't tell me that doesn't make for a fascinating story.

This documentary centers around the 400-year dynasty that held sway in Copan from the fifth to ninth centuries A.D.  One of the most magnificent of Mayan cities, the site was only rediscovered in the Honduran jungle in 1839.  The hieroglyphs that decorate seemingly every structure there obviously told a story, but it was not until recent years that researchers have begun to get a grasp on the Mayan writing system (one of only five truly original writing systems in the world).  After figuring out the calendar system (which the Mayans used to accurately predict eclipses, calculate time, closely identify the orbit of Venus, etc.), experts such as David Stuart managed to begin translating this vast storehouse of ancient knowledge - and, in doing so, follow the story of the rise and fall of this historical dynasty.

Here, we join archaeologists as they continue their important work at Copan, an investigation that almost has to begin with K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' (Great Sun Green Quetzal Macaw), founder of the dynasty.  Once viewed in somewhat mythic terms, the story of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' has now taken on a largely historical truth.  In fact, we join archaeologists exploring the mighty Copan acropolis in viewing the great king's human remains (strong circumstantial evidence links them with K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo').  Having rather confidently proven the dynastic founder's existence, the video then goes on to describe this man - who was not native to Copan - and the manner in which he was able to prevail over local warlords and consolidate power in the fifth century AD.  A surprising amount of this history is there in plain site - in the walls, stelae, monuments, etc.  Only recently, for the first time in well over a millennium, can we learn the secrets these hieroglyphics have kept to themselves for so long.  Altar Q, a remarkable monument featuring the sixteen kings of the K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' dynasty, is a particular focus of the presentation.  All of this begs the question: just how did this dynasty retain power through sixteen generations?  Here we get into some of the rituals the kings performed, from conjuring visions of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' to human sacrifice.  We then follow the decline of the dynasty in the wake of the 13th ruler's capture and beheading, the story culminating in the 16th and final ruler's failed attempts to hold together a society that had already fallen apart.

One could argue that Mayan civilization was just as advanced as that of ancient Egypt, yet its wonders have never been able to escape from the shadows of the Pyramids and the Sphinx.  Now that many ancient ruins are reemerging from the jungles of Central and South America and experts are translating more and more Mayan hieroglyphics, this area is becoming the real epicenter of archaeological discovery.  If you're unfamiliar with the Mayan story, this documentary would certainly make for a most instructive introduction to one of the greatest Mayan cultures so far discovered.",1154304000,,3838,5.0315955766192735
7931901,5,B000056C1L,"This well done documentary surrounding the mysterious first king of Copan, (Yax K'uK Mo) and the 400 year dynasty he established was very enlightening and a must see for any student of Maya history.  For that matter, anyone who has visited the ruins of any Maya city will find this video entertaining; especially those who have been to Copan.",1055462400,4,342,4.796610169491525
