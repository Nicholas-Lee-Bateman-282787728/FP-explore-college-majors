8191317,1,B0009J2LYA,"Don't be confused by the length of this review. The Last Fart was a short, 3.5 minute (with credits) INSULT. NEGATIVE stars.

I was ordering some Spaghetti Westerns when this popped up as a link / suggestion from Amazon.
Quickly reading (mis-reading) through the mixed reviews (and trying to figure out what type of person would sit there with a stop watch calculating the total ""fart"" time in a movie) I thought this might find it's way into my collection next to Attack Of The Killer Tomatos.
We all went out to dinner and looked forward to seeing what we hoped could possibly be a new contendor for the Top 10 Worst Movies ever made hall of fame.
We popped in the DVD, sat back and watched what what looked like a 3.5 minute (bad) movie trailer. Then a blank screen.
Did I press the wrong button? Is my DVD player broken?
OK. Time to read the box.
The whole ""movie"" is 3.5 minutes, with a lot of credits, and it had the nerve to suck on top of everything.
I don't know how anyone could give this a good rating unless they were related to someone or getting paid.
It's not worth my time to return a $15.00 item. I'll probably use the box as a replacement.
I may lie about how good this was and give it to one of my friends. Then after they figure out what happened, they can give it to someone else.
Like a Bad Joke chain letter.
In my opinion, Amazon should remove any links to this product and call special attention to the length.",1235520000,4,1435,4.275735294117647
8191318,1,B0009J2LYA,THIS DVD IS A RIP-OFF.  THREE AND ONE HALF MINUTES OF BLACK AND WHITE BOREDOM.  NOT FUNNY.  ZERO STARS IS MY RATING BUT NOT AN OPTION.,1171065600,2,134,4.076923076923077
8191319,1,B0009J2LYA,"I bought this for a laugh. I thought it was a feature. It was positively reviewed.

It turned out to be only 90 seconds (or so) long, and looked like it had been shot with

an early cell phone camera. It wasn't even a good or funny fart. I guess the joke was on me.",1170720000,3,265,3.8
