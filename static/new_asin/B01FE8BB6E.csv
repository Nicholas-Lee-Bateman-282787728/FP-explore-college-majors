8760683,3,B01FE8BB6E,"Seasons 1, 2, 3, & 4 were great entertainment with interesting murder plots, but not so much in season 5, when they added JR the nephew. For one thing, increasingly the cases personally involved JR or Betty, stretching reality too thin -- I mean, what are the odds that Betty would be in love with a criminal or that she would be targeted by a killer? Or that her best friend would be victimized? Ridiculous, in addition to Merriwether being one of my least favorite actresses and JR coming off like a young whippersnapper (to borrow a folksy term that Barnaby might have used) who thinks he knows more than he does. I remember being disappointed with this turn of events when I watched the show back in the 1970s. Barnaby Jones was my favorite detective, but only when he worked alone. (I also wonder why it was so much more expensive than the earlier seasons.)",1497830400,6,862,4.532051282051282
