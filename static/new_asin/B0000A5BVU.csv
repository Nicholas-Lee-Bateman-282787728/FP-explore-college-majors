7996186,5,B0000A5BVU,"Extremely important training for self defense !!! As a police officer for twenty nine years, I highly recommend this DVD.  Thanks, Tom",1428624000,,134,5.090909090909091
7996187,5,B0000A5BVU,"Another reviewer emphasized that this is not useful for
civilian self defense and I disagree. I've practiced mixed
martial arts for more than a decade and have taught self
defense seminars and this material is excellent. It is produced
in an old school manner and the production quality is outdated
but the instruction is clear as a bell and the techniques shown
are only the best and most proven street effective ones, nothing
is presented that won't work in the real world.

Another reviewer seemed to complain that these techniques require
lots of practice. Well, yeah. If you don't practice self defense
you will not learn to defend yourself, period. But if you only
want to learn a concise toolkit of self defense tactics and can
drill them - hopefully with a skilled partner - these are excellent.",1377388800,,803,4.818840579710145
7996188,3,B0000A5BVU,"The film gives instruction for situations where a police officer is under attack with bare hands, or melee weapons. The techniques are explained in detail, and at the same time a technique is shown, Chuck Habermehl explains the technique verbally. On several occasions, there is also an alternative technique taught besides the main technique. On some occasions, Habermehl refers to a technique he states has been covered elsewhere (in some other film), and does not give a proper instruction of the technique here.
For the most part, the techniques are realistic and effective. There are some techniques that either require lots of practise, or are not very universally useful, though. These techniques are mainly alternative techniques, but I wonder why teach these techniques at all, instead of resorting to simplier and more universally applicable techniques.
The best thing in the film is that Habermehl demonstrates some commonly used techniques that are either not very effective, or are even dangerous to the user. That way you have the opportunity to learn better tehniques, before you need them in a fight.
This film is aimed for police officers. Civilians can benefit from the techniques also, but the objective for a cop is to subdue the attacker, which is not normally the main objective for a civilian. That fact limits the usefulness of the techniques taught here for civilians.
Run time: 1:35
