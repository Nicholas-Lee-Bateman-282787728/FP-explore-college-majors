1409611,4,B000059XVA,"There are few of the early television performers from my childhood that I remember more than Jimmy Durante.  He is one of a kind, and, as this retrospective points out, it's not easy to define why he was so beloved.
There could be better jobs of putting a retrospective together, but, this is all we have so far of Durante's television variety/comedy years, so it will have to do.  There were times I would liked to have seen a bit more of a particular bit, but this is a good taste of what those performances were like.
The transfer to DVD is quite good considering the age of the kinescopes and film.
If you remember Durante, you'll enjoy this video and wish there were more.",1075248000,11,677,4.408
1409612,4,B000059XVA,"Jimmy Durante's comic persona is one of the great inventions of the 20th century.  Out of the bitterest of lemons -- gnomish stature, bald pate, Homeric nose, a voice like gravel pouring down a tin chute -- the Schnozzola concocted pure lemon gin fizz.
Keaton and Chaplin may've been greater artists, Groucho had better material, and W.C. Fields was a more acute observer of the human condition, but nobody was more fun to watch than Jimmy at full throttle: that strut, that battered fedora, that passionate, if aggrieved, air of the master beset by lesser lights (""Everybody wants ta get inta de act!"") -- it's all here, and if you're as susceptible to his high-voltage charm as I am, you'll be left helpless with laughter.
One quibble: For a tape compiled of clips from a variety show, there's really not much variety.  Delightful as Jimmy's song and dance routines are, I'd like to have seen a few complete skits, too (rather than the handful of snippets we get featuring showbiz legends like John Wayne and Frank Sinatra).  And didn't anyone ever film an interview with Jimmy?  Informative as the segments with his wife, daughter and Leonard Maltin are, seeing how The Schnozz comported himself offstage and out of the spotlight (no performer was ever more ""on"" when he was on) would've been  ""da piece of resistance!""
Something to watch for: since it's not mentioned in the narration or on the box, the producers apparently didn't realize that one of the ""Durante Girls"" sitting next to Jimmy during an early production number is a very young Mary Tyler Moore!",991958400,20,1565,4.824626865671642
1409613,4,B000059XVA,"I first caught this on PBS. I laughed, I cried, I ordered a copy for myself and one for my mom. Really great nostalgic stuff, many of the best numbers from Jimmy's NBC TV show from the early fifties, along with some (not too many) recent interviews and commentary from Jimmy's family and the film critic Leonard Maltin. If you are old enough to remember Jimmy Durante, black and white TV, live broadcasts with ad libs, and Inka-Dinka-Do, this is a must see.",991612800,8,457,4.518072289156627

7934285,5,B000059XVA,"I'm an entertainer and remember seeing my parents watch this show when I was about three. WOW! WOW! WOW! What INCREDIBLE showmanship and pizaaz! I had forgotten -- and most do not know -- this part of Durante's life. The energy and charisma of Jimmy Durante, plus his natural ability to be funny is hard to describe. If you are an entertainer GET THIS TAPE AND STUDY IT. Yes, he uses old jokes, and the songs sound like they're straight out of vaudeville. He did a lot with comedy songs. And he WROTE THEM (the melodies). I enjoyed this DVD perhaps more than any dvd I have bought in years...and as an entertainer will watch this periodically hoping I can asborb some of his showmanship",1435536000,,686,4.496
7934286,5,B000059XVA,"I loved this when I had it on tape, but now I have a DVD player.  He was a rare person, because I loved his weekly show when I was only 7 and 8 years old.  I love playing this once in a while.  He was a kind and funny guy.",1430006400,,222,3.3137254901960786

7934288,5,B000059XVA,"At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy video but in a matter of minutes I was laughing out loud. It's hilarious! The ad libs, the audience participation, wonderful old time television. The picture quality is not A-1 but that can't be expected from the old kinescope recordings but it is still very good. There really is not much ""unknown"" stuff here but the video itself is great. Wonderful to see Sinatra, Ethel Barrymore, Liberace, Donald O'Connor and more. Also nice to see Mrs. Durante and Jimmy's adopted daughter CeCe speaking about their husband and father. My personal opinion of this DVD is five stars in spite of whatever flaws it has. Sorry that they have discontinued producing it.",1264204800,,703,4.770491803278689
7934289,5,B000059XVA,"Great collection of clips from Durante's television program.  Of course, I would prefer to have complete programs, but this will have to do.  It's just such an absolute treat to be able to see anything from his TV show.  Just accept it as a much too short tribute to Durante.",1245110400,,275,4.46
7934290,1,B000059XVA,"There is so much that could've been there and wasn't.  This is akin to an hour long TV special that uses the clips available from the network.  It's pretty shallow, all in all.",1215388800,2,176,4.303030303030303

7934292,3,B000059XVA,"After seeing the Unknown Marx Brothers DVD and being impressed with the quality, I believed this DVD would be similar in content. I was very wrong. This DVD is less of a documentary about Jimmy Durante than it is a clip show of funny moments from his television show. Unfortunately, it is not marketed that way. But even if it were, wouldn't it make more sense to just watch the episodes themselves instead of seeing chopped up versions?

The extent of the information about Durante's life is as follows: he began his life with an ambition to play piano in a saloon, he was an unlikely star, and he was a good father. Period, the end. This information is relayed by quick bits with Durante's wife, daughter, and film historian Leonard Maltin, but their presence is inconsequential.

Durante had a very full life and career with far more accomplishments than just a tv show that ran a few years. Why aren't his films with Buster Keaton discussed? How did he get into the movie business? How did Inka Dinka Doo become his trademark song? When did he die?

Fortunately, we do get a glimpse of Durante's vibrant personality, which is the only reason this DVD is worth watching. His repetative jokes never get old because he delivers them genuinely every time. His bland singing voice is a treat everytime he opens his mouth. Without that level of showmanship, this DVD would be a total waste.",1199491200,3,1388,4.6571428571428575
7934293,2,B000059XVA,"Too often on DVD's that are retrospective, contemporary people who have nothing to do with the subject of the DVD are included with their silly opinions. On this it is Leonard Maltin whose head and moving mouth comprise about 1/4 to 1/3 of the one hour. Seeing Mr. Durante's wife and daughter speak today is fine. They were there. Maltin was not and while a Maltin DVD can include his opinions and insight, he does not belong here. With the plethora of people from then, both then and now, who can be included, it befuddles and annoys me why Leonard Maltin peppers this DVD so generously that it should be called ""Maltin on Durante.""",1141948800,,633,4.56140350877193
