2768613,2,B000NHG7DY,"Some nice camera work, decent efforts by scores and scores of CW reenactors but the plotline circled and went right into a dark morass. I would not purchase this DVD. Get it from Netflix if you have a hankerin' to see something new with Union men and Rebs blazin' away at each other.
Routine romance angle, Southern hero and Union wife. The few black people in the film were in the distant backgrounds except for one woman doing laundry. The cast was weak and just didn't fit their roles. It could have been so much better but seems to me like the director found where there was to be some large scale Civil War reenactors/battles and quickly assembled his cast and embedded them with the too many clean shaven Rebs and Yanks.
Just my thoughts.",1182902400,10,744,4.518518518518518

The story begins before the war in the south. It also develops the interaction of divided families which have intermarried-northerners and southerners.

There are some very well done combat scenes. There are some beautifully done character developments. The viewer will enjoy a fine film filled with conflict and resolution.

The acting wasn't as polished as todays blockbusters are, but this is a real story about real people played by a descendant of the real life main character. That's pretty neat in itself...
Kinda like when Elizabeth Montgomery played her ancestor Lizzy Borden in 1975.
i withheld a couple of stars because i felt with such a HUGE plantation mansion that more should have been done to portray the slaves.... and i wanted to see what the Yankee command thought about the escaped Confederates.

2768649,1,B000NHG7DY,"It is such a shame that this family did not have the wisdom to ask someone in the movie business to help with his film. I could not wait for the movie to end. I felt like I was watching 21st century actors playing at being 19th century charters and it just didn't work. This family should have done more research into the customs of that time because Robert and Eveline would never had been out alone together without a chaperone. It just was not done, especially not in the south. Also nice respectable young ladies always had there hair done up tightly on there heads and not falling all around there face like the actress in this movie. It just amazed me that at the height of the civil war that Eveline's teeth were beautifully white and her clothes were in such pristine condition, and after years of war. By the end of the movie I felt nothing for these charters, especially Mickey Rooney's performance as Eveline's dying grandfather. I felt like I never took a journey back in time to one of the bloodiest times in American history. This could have been one of the best civil war movies with such a rich family history but sadly it missed the mark.

2768654,5,B000NHG7DY,"This delightful film, based on a true story, was produced by, and features descendants, of the family whose story is told here.

The film takes its time to unroll. Among the remarkable events shown with careful attention to historical accuracy, Robert Adams experiences imprisonment at Elmira, among the more despicable POW camps in history.

From stories left by my ancestor in the 52nd NC Infantry, who starved nearly to death at Point Lookout, I know there is no exaggeration in this film.

It is a surprise to many that U.S. soldiers brutalized, starved, and murdered other American soldiers in these camps (the largest mass grave in the Western Hemisphere is at Camp Douglas, Chicago, another U.S. Army-run PW camp).

Camp Sumter in Georgia (Andersonville) had the same overall casualty rate as the United States PW camps, but U.S. prisoners went hungry there on the same rations given their Confederate guards.

In contrast, in the North, Confederate POWs starved in the midst of plenty. At Elmira, New York, U.S. Army guards turned away local citizens who brought farm produce to the gate for the Confederate prisoners inside; the U. S. Army commandant sold the official rations on the black market and pocketed the proceeds, while the Confederate soldiers starved.

2768665,5,B000NHG7DY,"We are Civil War buffs so when we came across this DVD on Amazon it sounded like one that we would enjoy. The fact that the lead male character is the great, great grandson of the actual character he portrays in the movie just adds so much validity to the story of the Last Confederate. The movie only had two expletives in it and the romance scenes were very tastefully done. This is a movie based on a true family's experiences. The battle scenes are very well done though they are graphic in showing what war is really like. We enjoyed the EXTRAs that are included on this DVD as much as the actual movie. The interviews with the real family descendants and the actors who portrayed them is very moving. And the Outtakes of scenes that were adapted or omitted is interesting as well. It is a movie that we will watch again and again, each time picking up new details from the storyline. Price is really great and for under $5 you will have a piece of historical entertainment you will enjoy and learn from. War is real and it impacts families for generations.",1348444800,8,1062,4.423469387755102
2768666,1,B000NHG7DY,"This is simple a poorly made film. The acting is mediocre; the sets and costuming are far from authentic or accurate to the period. I'm sure that the folks who made this piece were sincere in their attempt, but it just doesn't made the grade. Try Ang Lees' ""Ride With the Devil"" or ""Pharoah's Army"" if you're looking for quality films about the Civil War. I felt like I wasted my money on this DVD.",1348012800,2,398,4.32
2768667,5,B000NHG7DY,"'The Last Confederate' is a Civil War Love Story based on the true story of people in my hometown of Columbia, South Carolina in Richland County. As a civil war buff, I learned alot in this movie, ie, had no idea they shipped so many confederates to the prison in Elmira, NY toward the end of the war because of overcrowding.
Julian Adams, a USC Graduate, plays the lead of his real ancestor, Robert Adams. His Father and the Producer, Weston Adams, speaks with the accent that I grew up hearing as a child, exactly how my Father and his entire family speak from Sumter.

It's worth seeing if only for the gift of hearing Weston's authentic southern accent which is derived from England and is a beautiful sound to hear. I fear it's dying away with our culture as I'm deprived of hearing it on a daily basis now having moved only to NC years ago amoung the many transplants in RTP. Yes, there's a difference, believe it or not ; )

No, this is not a Hollywood epic but it's a lovely story going back and forth in time to highlight the struggle of loyalty and love between Robert Adams and his wife, a Yankee of all things, Ha !

Watch this movie and the back story in 'Special Features' to gain better knowledge of why it's so special.",1338508800,3,1235,4.337662337662338
2768668,1,B000NHG7DY,I've been a Civil War buff for 20 years.  I've read and watched just about everything on the subject.  I must say this was one of the WORST Civil War movies I've ever seen.  I think that what the family are doing to preserve their family story is important.  If you research Captain Adams the movie is completely diffrent then real life.  There was no escape from prison.  There was no rescues.  Even the title of the movie is misleading.  Wasted Money.  Also very bad acting.,1327449600,2,476,4.441860465116279
2768669,5,B000NHG7DY,"This is a great story.  It is based on the life of Robert Adams and those events while in the Civil War.

He part in the Civil War but most important his life after the Civil War how he lived, what he did after the war till his death. That would be most interesting. I hope you redo his life story.

2768671,1,B000NHG7DY,"Initially, I decided to rent this movie to view a perspective on the Civil War that didn't portray the North as god-like gladiators for once in my life.

Lets say a 10 means this movie is the new Citizen Kane, and I'll be raving about it to my friends for weeks.
Let's say a 0 means I'm turning it off.

I started this movie at about a 7, for the reason listed above. In the opening scene of the movie, blacks and whites are depicted picnicking together, lolligagging, and playing dignitarian chess with one another. I was confused. Although this came off like some apologists wet dream, I still had some faith that this movie could be redeemable.

The first scene of painfully slow dialogue began, and the number instantly dropped to a 5. Yes, the dialogue is painfully slow. Every scene in the movie is slow, monotone, and overly dramatic -- as overly dramatic as slow and monotone acting can be. Every time a new set of dialogue appeared, I found myself cringing at the fact that I'd have to sit and wait for another five minutes. In fact, this dropped the number to about a 3, as it quickly becomes unbearable and brings the progress of the story to a crawl.

The acting is terrible. And it seems, with each introduction of a new character, I had to cringe and give them the benefit of a doubt. About three quarters of the way through the movie, my number dropped to a 1; I was gathering the strength to get off my couch and eject the disk I was pretty sure I wasted my money on.

Three fourths of the way through, there's a sex scene with the *beautiful* actress, who plays the love interest of the main character; although the scene is quick and pointless, the fact that I got to see her bare back brought the number up to a 2.

Then I was tossed back into slow, agonizing, poorly executed dialogue, and I couldn't bare it anymore. I had to turn it off. 0. That's right: 0. Off switch.

In closing, this movie is about the quality of an old PBS film. The story line is painfully obvious, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is unbearable, and there's really nothing in this film that contributes to the fact that it's ""based on a true story."" I just consider myself fortunate that I rented it, instead of bought it.

I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. I guess I'll just have to watch a Northern gladiator movie next time and root for the bad guys.",1297987200,9,2369,4.368181818181818

If you want to be blown away with great cinema, the story is top notch. The reason to watch this movie is not to see the latest movie star, or perhaps to see the biggest budget film set. No, as an independant film this movie is top notch. I just wanted to take the time to say thank you to the sender for this film to provide it at an affordable price in good condition and to amazon.com to providing such quality products.",1295913600,,557,4.166666666666667

It turned out to be a great film about the american civil war. This time seen from the conferederate view.
It is based on a real story. A captain in the confederate army is caught be the north and sent to a prison, which apparently is Elmira. All the time we follow his thoughts about home and family, so the movie goes back and forth in time.
After a while he escapes from the prison. We follow him, as he makes his way back.

2768675,4,B000NHG7DY,"Great movie which we enjoyed watching.  But the movie turned from a ""we like it"" to a ""we love it"" when we saw the Extras which included a documentary of the making of the film and we realized just how true to life it was.  Many of the family members participated in so many ways and many of the props were authentic.

My largest complaint however is in the editing & sequencing of the movie.  It has so many flashbacks and flashforwards it is hard to follow the plot.  Very confusing & way over the top.  My wife stopped the movie several times and asked ""are they married now?"" and I had to reply ""yeah I *think* so because ...""

I would love to know where soldiers were getting their ammunition as none of them were wearing any cartridge boxes. One of the Union Soldiers was was wearing an army coat and blue jeans. Most of the battle scenes were fought by diorganized mobs, which never would happen during the civil war. The main character was an Infantry Captain, he was wearing no rank insignia and a wore an enlisted mans uniform. And biggest HE RODE A HORSE! Junior Infantry officers never rode horses unless on staff which he was not. Bad movie in my mind.",1257465600,4,702,4.449612403100775

As a ""hobby writer"", I found the story wonderfully romantic, acted out with the charm and glamour of that time.  A great job was done in keeping the story unpredictable, which was a delight to me since I have a tendency to guess where story lines are headed.  I am a Christian and appreciate the delicacy of the romantic scenes and would say it was in no way offensive.  The connection of the actors to the story add so much to my own enjoyment.

2768682,4,B000NHG7DY,"First of all I am shocked with the few reviews I have read here. I think this family has accomplished a monumental project.  I give them full support and congratulations for using their own money, resources and family to undergo such a project.

Anyone who is such in tune with their family history would be very proud to have this type of film made.  Just as books are written, there are those that will appeal to only a certain region.  South Carolina and it's citizens are very proud of this film.

I can not believe that anyone could be so cruel to heavily attack this film with such heavy criticism.  I was describing this film yesterday to my son and remember telling him that this is not a film about the Civil War, it is a film about a real Southern family.  The photography was stunning and the use of the light from the magic hour provided a warm sense of mood.

I really do not think anyone in the world could have produced a much better film on their first attempt.  I clearly give them a thumbs up for their accomplishment.  No, I do not know the family at all.  Yes, I do understand the film, it projects a feeling that most southern born descendants of Confederate soldiers have.  Most Confederate soldiers service history is minimum and the families that are fortunate to have personal items and stories handed down are very fortunate.  One reviewer remarked that there was not enought story to make a movie, that is shallow thinking...If you know your history and the history of the unit such as Butler's Cavalry, all you have to do is plug in one Captain Adams to know his experience as well as those of whom he fought with.

I saw other criticise the use of re-enactors and stock film footage.  I was personally involved in the 125th Anniversary Re-enactments of the Civil War and on nearly every event there were cameras rolling by a company called Classic Images as well as other companies.  This was a film makers paradise.  Where else could you every have to opportunity to have thousands of background actors equiped with authentic uniforms, weapons, horses, tack, camps, artillery, etc and spend nothing more that what it would cost to send out a film crew for some location shooting? Every re-enactor purchases his or her own equipment and that amounts to well over $2000.00 for each person down to the black powder used in their guns.  There is probably not a film company in Hollywood that would spend that kind of money to outfit such a large army for background.  In the movie Glory, soldiers in background carried rubber rifles and other arms, canvas was painted black to make straps and belts, etc.  In the Patriot, most of the background action of the thousands of soldiers in the British Army were Computer Generated Graphics.

As for authenticity, ok, someone missed a re-enactor who was wearing a bold wristwatch, but that particular re-enactor should have been better prepared and he should have known better that to wear the wristwatch.  Even at the large re-enactments, it is always tough to make sure that everyone is ""in period"" one reason is because not everyone is educated properly to present themselves in the field before an event.

I enjoyed the epic movie Gettysburg, but I could spend a lot of time criticising the authenticity and acting of some of those in that movie.  I enjoyed it for what is was and it was one of the best attempts Hollywood has produced in making a documentary entertaining.  There was a lot of carboard actors delivering lines in that movie.

Well, I could go on, but I will stop here.  I will say thank to the Adams Family and Congratulations for a job well done.  This film is a family treasure and another nicely recorded remembrance of another one of South Carolina's faithful soldiers who did his duty.",1243036800,13,3780,4.635135135135135

2768684,5,B000NHG7DY,"Man, do I disagree with those reviewers who gave 'The Last Confederate' a low rating.  Were they watching a different film than I was?  The movie is an insightful and INTELLIGENT portrayal of the event that transformed the nation.  Also, the choice of the actor...apparently a distant relative...to play the real-life Robert Adams, works.  The man is a genuine Southernor [as opposed to a Hollywood Southernor] and sounds, looks and behaves like a Southernor.  His acting is convincing. The quality of the audio on my DVD was poor but I rate a movie/book on its overall quality, not technicals.

This is an absolutely superior film about love and war.  The director has managed to weave a beautiful and sensitive love story into, through and around the brutality of an incredible war.  The primary character, Robert Adams, is wonderful in his dedication to his woman and especially to the land he loves.  He is a patriot, a nationalist and also a bit of a fanatic.  When given more than an opportunity to quit the war and live peacefully with the woman he loves, he opts for privation, hardship, loneliness and danger.  Others may quit but Adams doesn't.

Nevertheless, Adams is riven by guilt for having his men and friends killed around him.  Likewise, he feels guilt for abandoning the woman he truly loves.  He is guilty of convincing men who aren't cut out for war into the fray, where they are slaughtered.  Crawling with guilt but with a sense of honor even greater, he fights on...

2768685,1,B000NHG7DY,"History veracity doesn't necessarily translate into cinematic virtuosity. The well-intentioned people that fought tooth and nail to produce the 2005 Civil War romance ""The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams"" (* out of ****) a.k.a. ""Strike the Tent,"" are direct descendants of the protagonist. Co-director, producer, scenarist, and leading man Julian Adams, who plays his real-life great-great grandfather Robert Adams, deserves recognition for this reverential independent film production that depicts one Southerner's view of the War Between the States. Indeed, Adams has garnered several Indie film awards for this effort. Nevertheless, ""The Last Confederate"" qualifies as a tedious re-enactment with wooden performances by all except Mickey Rooney in a bit part as a bedridden Pennsylvania uncle. However, I must add that ""The Last Confederate"" is a film worth watching, even though I didn't like it. I had to opportunity to speak with Julian Adams, the auteur who wore all the hats on the production, and he shared his experiences in making the film. Although I loathe this amateurish movie, I have a great deal of respect for the trials and tribulations that Adams endured to produce and distribute it. Anybody who peruses this critique can disagree with my appraisal of the film. Mr. Adams took issue with my appraisal. Feedback isn't something that I often receive. Had Adams been a Hollywood mogul, I'd have laughed in this face, but he isn't a mogul. He knows that his film isn't perfect, but it isn't perfect because he didn't have a budget.

As the descendant of a Mississippi Civil War soldier, I enjoy movies told from the Confederate perspective, but ""The Last Confederate"" conjures up little suspense and excitement, and the dialogue is hopelessly contrived. Sadly, the actors and actresses could have been reading their lines directly from cue cards for all the heart that they put into their performances. Once again, this is an independent production and good talent doesn't come without some considerable expense. Let's just say that they performed their parts as the late Spencer Tracy observed. They uttered their lines and they didn't bump into the furniture. As the hero, Adams generates a dearth of charisma, but then he did have his hands full with producing this epic, right down to sinking his own money into the handguns and the muskets.

Technically, everything appears accurate enough, but dramatically, this period piece never generates momentum, even during the explosive battle scenes. Adams manages to stage one good gunfight in a shack toward the end. Indeed, most of the epic scale battle sequences are simply re-enactors fighting battles with cameras set up on the periphery of the action. I know because I was once a television news reporter and I shot footage of the battle of Shiloh. These scenes with hundreds of dutiful re-enactors parading around and discharging their black powder arms contribute solid production value, but they don't bolster the drama. Adams renders no judgments against either side, North or South, and the political content is conspicuously absent, but ""The Last Confederate"" wasn't made to pontificate about values. Adams told me that he was simply relating the facts of history. In any case, on his tight budget, adopting an attitude would have been more than his low budget could have accommodated. The romance between Adams and a Pennsylvania woman, Eveline McCord (co-scenarist Gwendolyn Edwards of ""The Broken Hearts Club""), who came to South Carolina to teach school before hostilities broke out, lacks any poignancy. Alas, it's really a shame, but this romance really occurred.

Directors A. Blaine Miller and Julian Adams relate their yarn in flashback. Our hero, Captain Robert Adams, rushes to the aid of a wounded Confederate soldier and looks up to find a Union soldier drawing a bead on him with his revolver. The remaining 90 or so minutes that ensues is devoted to events before and after the war, and with a hint that perhaps the protagonist didn't survive this trial by bloodshed. Miller and Adams never make the protagonists seem sympathetic until the middle of the action when Adams and two of his friends engineer an escape from a Federal prison and a vengeful Yankee officer pursues them. The filmmakers lacked the budget to develop the kind of tension that would make you fear for the lives of the characters. The villain isn't very villainous.  For the record, Adams survived the war, and Eveline and he raised four children and ran a school. What makes Robert Adams is important and essential as a Confederate patriot is never explained. Julian Adams doesn't provide enough insight into his character to differentiate him from countless other characters. He strikes a gallant figure, but we never get under his skin. Alas, the fortunes of low budget film-making prevented Adams from addressing this problem. The romance between the hero and the heroine is sterile. Some histrionics--you crying, screaming, shouting, torrid kissing--wouldn't have harmed this otherwise cardboard drama. Shawn Lewallan's color photography makes the grade, but there isn't much subtlety in his lighting. If you suffer through the end credits, the producers reveal that they invoked dramatic license to make their history more palatable. Ostensibly, ""The Last Confederate"" boasts ambitious intentions, but delivers only a modicum of dramatic impact. Comparisons with the multi-million dollar ""Cold Mountain"" are inevitable. Initially, when I reviewed this film (which I bought with my own bucks, I described it rather disparagingly as ""Dull Mountain."" I still think it is pretty dull, but I will be a man enough critic to applaud Mr. Adams for making this film. He invested his heart and soul in ""The Last Confederate."" While I didn't care for this movie, I appreciate it a lot more after having a conversation with Mr. Adams.

2768686,4,B000NHG7DY,"It is interesting to see a movie where the lead character is portrayed by his own Great-Great-Grandson, who ironically turns out to be a spitting image of the actual person.  Set during the War Between the States, it is an unusual film in that it actually gives the reasons for the Southern point of view, instead of just the typical South bashing prevalent in War Between the States movies.  Unfortunately, it falls short of being a good movie, mainly because of the constant use of flashbacks and the switching back and forth between time periods to the point where it is confusing.  Also, the movie was too serious all the time.  There were scenes where lightheartedness was called for, such as in the beginning early courtship stage of the love story, which would make the viewer get more involved in the plot.  Also, it is kind of shocking that the descendants of the couple would include a risque love scene of their own ancestors.  Times sure have changed!

No big scale romance, action, or sets... but a pervasive quietness that slowly steals the show.  One wishes it could have gone a little deeper, a little keener.  But it is more than reasonably well-done for a small budget, has a ring of authenticity, engaging lead characters... and a very repetitive, yet sweetly haunting score.  One wishes it had gone more to the heavier, heartier side, rather than skimming the surface so much; but you are not left with just light and shallow... but are indeed directed to the unexplored clues of something far deeper, and achefully wish they would truly have been more vibrantly clear.  So it gives one a feeling of being only half done, and not quite complete, with only a modestly wistful resolution.",1195689600,4,834,4.763888888888889
2768692,1,B000NHG7DY,"First off, I understand this was an indie film, and as such I didn't expect (or want) the seamless, slick, polished look of a typical high budget Hollywood film. But yikes! It would have been nice to have viewed a film with moderately good acting, an interesting plot or historical accuracy. Unfortunately, this film as none of these things.

The movie begins with the story of a pretty young northern woman who succumbs to the charms of a rich southern slave owner (the fact that a gold-digger was charmed by a rich man is the only believable part of the plot). This character becomes extremely hypocritical as the film progresses (although we, as the viewer are supposed to find her charming?)She extolls the ""virtues"" of slavery at the beginning of the film (after marrying) but then has a change of heart late in the war after Atlanta has burned and she is living in PA. Yeah...whatever darlin'.

The leading man, while good looking, has less acting ability than I have seen in students acting in middle school plays. Who did he sleep with to get the part, I wonder? On a humerous note it's funny to watch the film and take notice of how his uniform is always clean and he is always clean shaven. Maybe impeccable hygiene was fashionable during the 1860's?

Very sadly, throughout the film black slaves are cast as being happy with their state in life. They joyfully serve their white owners. In one scene blacks are actually portrayed to defend their white owners against the northerners who there to liberate them. This should be grossly insulting to anyone with a soul.

ON a technical note, the movie itself jumps back in forth through time. This makes following the film difficult at best, and extremely annoying at worst. All and all the combination of historical inaccuracies, wooden acting, completely unlikeable characters and overt racism completely ruins this movie.

Some may enjoy this movie, however. If you are member of the Adams family,  a history fan who must see every civil war film made, a racist or masochist, I highly recommend this film.",1195603200,7,2065,4.786516853932584

2768697,2,B000NHG7DY,"With all due respect to the Adams family, I am appalled by the image this film presented of 19th century American slavery. In all, but one scene African-Americans were portrayed as existing as something more than property. The whites were polite to them and the slaves displayed loyalty to their owners, it's as if slavery was never an issue in the American Civil War.

I did not have a problem with the way Union Troops were depicted, war always bring out the worse in all people--just look at Abu Ghraib. Some of you will be quick to point out that the movie is a love story and not a history lesson. But it is a not just a love story between a man and a woman. It is also about one family's love for a distorted memory of the past. In fact, many other Americans share a sentimental view of pre-civil war Southern culture and that is what troubles me about this film. That it is attempting to validate the illusion that the aristocratic South was a terrible lost, while in fact it deserved to be destroyed.

Still, I must give credit to both the technical and dramatic aspects of this movie. Although it is by far not a professional achievement, it is an impressive first attempt. I hope Julian Adams continues making movies. However, his future projects should be more emotionally detached so that he can stand back and see their true merit.",1187049600,6,1344,4.504098360655738

It is a tapestry into which are woven the values of love, honor, duty, courage, perseverance, loyalty and sacrifice.  Those of Southern heritage will appreciate their recognition of nuances mostly overlooked or ignored in Hollywood feature films about the Civil War.  Weston and Julian Adams are real-life father and son.  They portray Julian's Great-Great Grandfather Robert Adams who met and fell in love on the eve of the War with Eveline McCord, a lady from Philadelphia who came to South Carolina as a governess.  During the War, Robert was a captain in a South Carolina regiment.  Weston Adams has a cameo role; his son has the lead role and he bears an uncanny resemblance to his ancestor.  They play courtly Southerners well for they are courtly Southerners in real life.  There are no fake accents and melodramatic unsympathetic renderings here.  Julian's acting is understated and he lets the story shine through.  He is a handsome, sensitive actor and makes a memorable screen presence in his first major acting role and I look forward to seeing him in future roles.  Gwendolyn Edwards plays Eveline as an intelligent and accomplished young woman caught between two worlds and the struggle of mind and heart.

The cinematography is striking and the soundtrack scored by Alti Orvarsson is very nice and now available.  There are some good fighting sequences that capture the bitter agonies of war without being excessive or gruesome.  The love scenes are romantic, tender and sweet.  The supporting cast is very good and they work well within the framework of the story.  The documentary about the making of the film is interesting and reveals the Adams' passion to share the remarkable story of their ancestors.  They have done what many of us who are fascinated by our family histories wish we could do.

Behind the stories of glorious courage under fire and battle flags bravely flying were very human men and women who lived with hearts aching from the separation, constant fear of death and injury, the grief of loved ones lost. Robert and Eveline's story is that of so many who lived in that dreadful time. The true face of this war has been lost in dry history books and increasing attempts to politicize and narrow the conflict down to ""slavery as the sole cause"". Thanks to the Adams family for bringing back the human element!

So when I saw the title, ""The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams,"" I naturally thought that this movie was about Woolson's rebel counterpart (I am sure ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Oldest-Living-Confederate-Widow-Tells-All/dp/0375726632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All</a>"" was contributing to my interpretation as well).  The film is indeed about a real person, but Robert Adams did not live to see the 20th century let alone be in the running for the title of the last Confederate (which turns out to be an extremely disputed title given Confederate war records were largely destroyed at the end of the war).  However Adams did serve and fight in the Civil War, whereas Woolson was a drummer boy for an artillery regiment that never saw action.  The film was originally entitled ""Strike the Tent,"" which Civil War buffs might recognize as being the last words purportedly spoken by Robert E. Lee, but would leave most people without a clue that this is about the Civil War.  So at least ""The Last Confederate"" is a more obvious clue.

But what you cannot tell from either title is that what makes this independent film rather unique is that it was made because of the efforts of Adams' descendant.  Julian Adams, who co-wrote the script, co-produced the film, co-directed it, and plays the title role, is the great-great-grandson of Robert Adams.  Julian's father Weston, the family history, gets a story credit, plays the older version of great-grandfather (so Julian co-plays it as well), and does the film's narration.  The movie was filmed mostly in South Carolina and the Adams home is the one owned by Robert's brother and has been in the family since before the Civil War.  When the character of Robert takes out his watch that is the actual watch of the real Robert, and the piano music that we see Tippi Hedren playing was owned by Robert's wife, Eveline.  The story of anyone who went off to fight in the Civil War will have its moments, but Eveline McCord Adams makes this story even more interesting because she was a Yankee, who came to South Carolina to be a governess and teach the piano and who fell in love with a Southerner on the eve of the Civil War.

Such a relationship might be the stuff of melodrama, but one thing ""The Last Confederate"" has going for it is a sense of dignity.  Robert and Eveline are both portrayed as being solid and serious, no more prone to start yelling as they are to engage in copious weeping.  They might be in love, but they have no romantic illusions about the coming war.  Robert goes off to war to protect his land and the life he knows, but we also get the sense that he a much more realistic idea of what is going to happen to the South.  Adams is a planter, but we get no real sense of slavery on the family plantation, and it is the sense of inevitable death and destruction that the war brings that casts a shadow between Robert and Eveline.  The story is more like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Mountain/dp/B0001MDP3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Mountain</a>"" than it is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B000BYA4LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>,"" which is probably the best way of identifying the potential audience for this 2005 independent film.

Gwendolyn Edwards (who wrote some of the songs and music in the film) co-stars as Eveline, with co-screenwriter Joshua Lindsey as her brother Nelson McCord and Amy Redord as his wife Sylvia.  In addition to Hedren as Grandmother Adams, the Adams were able to get Mickey Rooney to play grandfather David McCord.  Eric Holloway plays Benjamin Young, who is Robert's companion through most of the war, including the time they spent in a Yankee prison in Elmira.  The film is co-directed by another first time filmmaker, A. Blaine Miller, and the production is able to take advantage of filming Civil War reenactors at play and incorporating such shots into their narrative (maybe it was stock footage, but I have yet to see a Civil War go wrong just pointing a camera at reenactors).  The film won several awards at various festivals and the fact that the Adams family not only got the film made but managed to make one that is pretty good has simply captivated a lot of viewers.  The DVD includes a documentary, ""Once Upon a Time in the South: Behind 'The Last Confederate'"" that fills you in on the family history and ends with shots of the graves of Robert and Eveline Adams, underscoring one final time that this movie is a most unusual family affair.",1183161600,146,4846,5.03
