8079092,4,B000ARTN38,"I was disappointed with ""Shaolin Idiot"". Although there are some funny bits and the English translation can be quite unintentionally hilarious there is very little Kung Fu here. So if that's what you're looking for forget it. The story concerns a police detective who gets killed by the bad guys. WHen he gets to the Pearly Gates they tell him they can't fdo aythgin about him because they don't know ""why"" he died. So he comes back as a ghost and helps his nephew (Stephen Chow - who admittedly has some very funny scenes and doesn't really want to help his uncle) get the bad guys. Without giving away anything it all works out in the end.  :-)

On the other hand ""The Last Hero in China"" has mind-boggling fight scenes throughout the film. Some stunts are unbelievable and the fight sequences are almost poetic. THIS is one of the most amazing Kung-Fu films I've seen. It's the typical Chinese cowboy movie but it's also very funny, not least because of the English translation. Jet Li (a Kung Fu master) moves to a small village to run a Kung Fu school and also be a doctor(?). And he has to deal with the monks who kidnap young girls and send them to various places in Asia as slaves. There is all kinds of spectacular fighting involving magic and such. Some of the scenes with the ladies from brothel next door are very funny. There is even a character who reminded me of Jerry Lewis in his early days. Highly recommended for the fight scenes.

Neither of these films is anywhere as funny as ""Shaolin Soccer"" but there is still loads of fun.",1279670400,,1547,4.4787234042553195
