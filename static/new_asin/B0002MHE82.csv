2105323,5,B0002MHE82,"This show show can only bw described with one word... FANTASTIC! I love this show. The show starts with Keitaro Urashima,a young five year old boy in utter puppy love. The girl he is in love with hears a rumor that if two people in love meet at Tokyo University they will live happily ever after. When the young girl is driving away in a truck to her new home she makes a promise with young Keitaro, that they will both see each other at Tokyo U. when they get older.

Now at the age of twenty Keitaro who is still in high school is getting D's in school, and has failed at getting in to Tokyo U.  three tims.(sad huh)Keitaro's parents refuse to support him any longer, and insist he is to get a job and move out. Coinsidently his grandma calls him and asks him to visit her.

When Keitaro gets to his grandma's place his grandma isn't there.

Keitaro jumps into the hot spring that is at the grandma's house.

When relaxing in the hot tub, Keitaro looks over to see a hot girl coming in the water. She knows something he doesn't.

Keitaro's grandma opened up an all girls dorm which has been in buisness for a long time. This is the dorm. The hot girl assumes he is a girl and cuddles up to him. When she feels his... you know,she screems and things get hectic.

After being chased down numerous hot girls screeming ""pervert"" Keitaro's aunt comes in to quiet things down. After Keitaro's.... interesting intro. he sits down at a table with aunt, grandma, and the four hot girls living at the dorm.

His grand mother tells Keitaro and the others about how she is retireing and the dorm will shut down without a manager. Gramps appoints Keitaro manager. The hot girl from the water named Naru,

rejects the idea but soon finds out a family member must take over the buisness.

To calm things down his Keitaro's aunt foolishly tells everyone

that Keitaro attends Tokyo U. With that Keitoro becomes appartment manager. Keitoro soon falls in love with Naru who is also tring to get in to Tokyo U. Naru although, beets the crap out of him when she sees him with other girls doing fine things that don't look so fine when someone slips and she walks in,... get it? So Naru also ends up falling in love with him but won't show it.

You now see the conflict. I won't ruin any more of it for you, but let me tell you this, this show is increadably funny, and if you don't buy this your life isn't complete! ( if you want to know more other summarys go through more)",1107216000,3,2457,4.317391304347826
2105324,5,B0002MHE82,"Hello friends, One important thing i have to say. This anime is GREAT, but to fully appreciate this anime, I suggest you read the manga/tokyopop novels. Well, watch the anime then read the manga comics after. You will be satisified.",1102032000,6,232,4.825
2105325,3,B0002MHE82,"It's not that the Love Hina anime is bad, per se--with the exception of a few episodes (and most of the Love Hina Again OVA), it isn't. But it's a lot less good than the excellent manga--almost every change to the story (and there are many) is for the worst. In particular, the anime goes too far with some of the more absurd elements from the manga, which was (for the most part) a real-world story with some moments of absurd exaggeration thrown in for comedic value. The anime bases entire storylines around these  absurdities (such as two entire episodes about Su's rampaging mecha-Toma robot turtles, Kentaro's giant rocketship, and Kanako's talking cat), however, and generally takes them way too far. Some of the changes to the story simply don't make sense. In the manga, Keitaro breaks his leg in a run of bad luck after being admitted to Tokyo U., leading to a strain in his relationship with Naru. In the anime, *Naru* is the one who breaks his leg, which makes all of the resulting drama difficult to swallow. Why is Naru so unsympathetic to Keitaro's plight when she's the one who caused it? The anime doesn't really bother trying to make sense out of the altered storyline.

If you haven't read the manga, it's worth checking out. Then again, the mange is even more worth checking out--it's much better.",1101081600,9,1317,4.672413793103448
2105326,4,B0002MHE82,"The other reviewers are all correct in certain aspects: the series is both brilliant and infuriating.  I'd rate it as probably the best introduction to ""no ultra violence, no sci-fi, minimal nods to Magical Girls and gadgets"" comedy romance you can get.  As a parent, I rate it ""a-ok"" for teens 13 and up.

The anime is substantially rewritten from the original manga but works well for the most part.  I particularly liked Shinobu's introductory episodes.  Sadly, the series ends with 3 movies which just kind of wrap things up in a cut'n'paste but without the Big Epilogue Ending.  Leaving out Seta and Haruka's relationship (it was hinted at so that the manga readers wouldn't lynch the animators) and the lack of that all important epilogue was infuriating to me.  There a few episodes where they frankly took less time than they should have getting the facial drawings and animation right. Several of the episodes suffer considerably from the animation budget allocations.  The first few episodes are also somewhat disorienting in that the ""fanservices"" (risque bits) are censored in a jarring manner (gravity-defying towel placement, etc).  The later episodes match the manga much better without being overtly offensive to more prudish types just by adjusting camera angles and such.

Of the series about 6 episodes are brilliant (most of the ones that focus on Motoko and the thoughtful philosophical ones.  The ocean-side play performance actually worked better in the anime than in the manga).  About 4 episodes are Pokemon-bad plot contrivances with the rest filling in the gaps in between.  The movies, taken as a collection of set pieces, are pretty good but they suffer a bit from the ""all animated movies must have at least one insipid song"" syndrome and the uneven pacing from having to cram what should have been another 25 episodes into 3 movies.

Whatever you do, DO NOT watch the series in English dubbing.  Whomever casted the English voices and wrote the dialog should be taken out, shot, flayed, field-dressed, and left in the sun.  Watch in the original Japanese with English subtitles --- its not that hard and you might learn some Japanese.  The original japanese voice casting is perfectly matched to the characters.

If you buy this set - please buy the books and vice versa: they are complementary packages in my view.  Also BE SURE and don't miss episode 25 in the Christmas Movie disk Extras.  It is key to the character definition of Motoko and Keitaro (and their friendship) -- and is really quite good.

Okay, I've listed most of the shortcomings... but overall I consider this a must have for any anime collection.",1100995200,30,2648,4.932279909706546
2105327,2,B0002MHE82,"For a supposed romantic comedy, this show is tremendously mean-spirited. Its one joke, repeated constantly, is the mistreatment of its protagonist, Keitaro, played for laughs. For half the show, Keitaro is despised by every single inhabitant of the hotel he works in. He's constantly accused of misdeeds, talked down to, beaten up, threatened with death by the sword, and so on. One wonders why he doesn't just leave after two days.

Chief among Keitaro's tormentors is Naru, inexplicably also his main romantic interest. She epitomizes what the proverb calls ""a dog that sits upon the hay,"" who neither puts the hay to use nor lets others use it. Whenever Keitaro is with her, she is spiteful toward him for no real reason, and usually beats him up. She appears to genuinely view him as a dangerous pervert, because when they have to sleep in the same room one time, she trembles with terror at the thought of Keitaro groping her in the night. So, it's strange indeed that she should fall in love with him; however, falling in love makes her act even more spitefully. For instance, when she thinks that he's not drooling with lust over her womanly figure enough, she strikes seductive poses and unbuttons her blouse, to make him ogle her, so she can beat him up for being perverted. What the hell? Completing my analogy, when other girls take interest in Keitaro, she tells them that he has no good qualities and isn't worth their time. If anyone goes out with him anyway, Naru attacks Keitaro.

To such a woman, one should say, ""Listen, babe, if you want to be cruel, either take up kicking puppies or become a college admissions officer,"" and take one's leave. Instead of doing this, Keitaro grovels in the dirt. As the series progresses, he becomes so browbeaten that he reflexively screams ""I'm sorry!"" whenever he sees Naru. In one episode, when he has doubts about his ""love,"" one dude makes fun of him for ""giving up"" Naru because, he says, Keitaro must have realized that such an unattainable goal was far beyond his abilities. Instead of offering the eminently sensible retort, ""No, it's because she's an emotionally manipulative, shallow little girl,"" Keitaro crawls back to her. Oh, rapture.

This setup is presented as a zany romantic comedy, but it's not romantic or funny. If Keitaro really were a scheming pervert, it might be funny, in a ""yee-haw, girl power teaches lustful male a lesson"" sort of way. But his fantasies are completely innocent: he goes through life in search of a girl he knew in his childhood, in order to marry her, so that they may go out on picnics and eat boxed lunches together. He's literally too well-brought-up to be perverted. There's no way a normal person can take pleasure in laughing at him. As for the romance, the show definitely tries to elicit genuine emotional involvement from the viewer at times, but Keitaro's cringing subservience eventually wears out one's sympathy. As for Naru, the show gives her a few flashbacks, to show that she has problems too and thus deserves some compassion, but this would work only if she herself had compassion for anyone.

The show is very bad at characterization. At one point, Naru and Keitaro go out for dinner. They enter a restaurant, and immediately the camera cuts to them going outside later, so the plot can advance. If these characters (who are the focus of the entire show, mind you) were actually given an opportunity to unwind and talk to each other at length about whatever suits their fancy, they might have gained depth, and their attraction to each other might have made sense. But they never do this: in fact, it seems like they've nothing whatsoever to say to each other. They have no interests in life. They've no political beliefs or favourite books or bands or films or paintings. They ask no questions about the world; they never wonder what role their lives should play in it. They study now and then, but they don't have any enthusiasm at all for the subjects they study. They are total strangers to each other. Yet the show is four times longer than the typical movie.

I admit, the show did improve in its second half, largely thanks to two supporting characters. The first is Mr. Seta, a patient father-figure type who is simultaneously a suave loverman, a master of karate, and a scientist, but who doesn't brag about his many talents or use them to threaten people. The latter quality especially is lacking in the show, so his laid-back attitude was most welcome. The second character is Mutsumi, who likes nature, admits to her numerous foibles, and appreciates the simple joys of life, unlike Naru and most other people in the show. She treats Keitaro like a human being, which in this company is already enough to make her seem like a shimmering saint. She even takes a liking to him, which leads to this encapsulation of the show's failings: At one point, Naru gets enraged over a triviality and punches Keitaro in the face, knocking him down. She storms out, but Mutsumi flies to Keitaro's side and tries to resuscitate him.

Anyway, it's easy to root for a kind and affectionate person, however one-dimensional, so I rooted for Mutsumi. A good woman is hard to find, after all. Alas, Keitaro chose Naru, and Mutsumi followed his wishes and gave up her claim on him. Naru beat Keitaro up, they resumed their roles at the hotel as if nothing had taken place between them, and nothing was resolved, probably because the writers wanted to leave themselves an opportunity to write equally shallow sequels later. So, when all's said and done, this is a wearisome, unsympathetic show.",1098835200,35,5603,4.76519052523172
2105328,5,B0002MHE82,"The story is incredible. It is absoutly hilarious. Naru always beating up the immortal Keitaro. Shy Shinobu always feeling sorry for him, and always being the nice one to him (because of her massive crush on Keitaro). Motoko always attacking him with her sword. Su and Sarah always greeting him with a tremondous kick to the face. and Kitsune laying back, sake in hand, laughing at it all. All of this makes this anime absolutly hilarious. No anime can best this when it comes to a romantic-comedy.

But like i said in the title. There is only one flaw. Keitaro and Naru don't get married in the end. One of the reasons why i bought this anime (other than i own the 14 book love hina magna series, and I loved it sdo i had to buy the anime) was to see Keitaro and Naru get married, and also see everyone grown-up. Now if your familer with the manga then you know that they got married in the end. and Seta and Haruka got married in Mol-Mol. but in this anime series, none of them get married. It really bummed me out. But hey! The anime is terrific! this is a great addition to everyones anime collection, and to people new to anime. Love Hina deserves a 6 out of 5 stars. It is truely terrific. If I were you, i would buy this as soon as you are done reading this review.",1098057600,7,1272,4.234567901234568
2105329,4,B0002MHE82,"Love Hina is a romantic/comedic harem style anime based on the shonen manga by Akamatsu Ken. Love Hina (Japanese Version Rabu-Hina) revolves around the main character Keitarou Urashima. Keitarou, a 20 year old, is trying to pass the entrance exams to got to Tokyo University (or Toudai in Japanese - Toudai is the Japanese equivalent of MIT) even though he has already failed three times.

Keitarou desires to go to Toudai because he made a girl a promise (when he was 4) that when they grew up they would go to Toudai and be together for ever. The little girl moves away and he can no longer remember anything about her, but he still tries to keep his promise to the girl to go to Toudai.

While studying for the entrance exams (again) Keitarou's grandmother, who owns the Hinata Inn - an all girls dormitory, decides to retire and ask Keitarou to take over as the manager. Keitarou readily agrees since he needs a place to stay and not knowing that it is an all girls dormitory. The girls of the dormitory initially reject a man coming to leave in the Hinata Inn but after mistaking thinking that he is already a Toudai student - which implies honor, responsibility, etc. - agree to reluctantly let him stay.

What follow after they find out he is only a want-to-be Toudai student is a hilarious comedy so Keitarou looks for the promised girl. As the anime continues and the supporting characters are developed, Keitarou has to overcome and survive flying turtles, renegade robots, entrance exams, broken hearts, crying girls, an angry samurai, a martial arts professor, and of course, the girls themselves.

Love Hina is a great comedy/romantic anime that you won't be able to put down until you complete the series.",1096588800,7,1719,4.72
2105330,5,B0002MHE82,This series is incredible.  It is good for people who love comedy anime and romance.,1096416000,2,84,4.6
2105331,5,B0002MHE82,"I have to admit that I was skeptical about an animated romantic comedy series, seeing as how I seldom enjoy live-action romantic comedies.  Still, after having this series recommended to me over and over again I decided to check it out.  I was very pleasantly suprised.  This is simply animatd entertainment at it's finest; great characters, engrossing storyline, hilarious slapstick comedy, over-the-top satire, and some of the most beautiful character designs I've ever seen make this series a no-brainer for all anime fans, and a great introduction to the art form for anime newcomers.  Think of this series as Japan's answer to Friends.  The story revolves around a young man, Keitaro, who becomes the manager of an all-girl apartment complex, Hinata, while working to be accepted to Tokyo University.  You see, as a small child he made a promise to a girl he loved and was forced to move away from that when they were older, they would meet as students at Tokyo U and live happily ever after.  Sure, he doesn't even remember who the girl is, but Keitaro obviously believes fate will guide him.  Also living in Hinata is a wacky cast of female characters; Naru, the object of Keitaro's affection who sports a mean temper and is also working to get into Tokyo U (hmmm...), Su is the lunatic genius of the bunch who is very reminiscent of Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Kitsume is the drunken meddler who views the many conflicts and dramas of the series as her own entertainment, Shinobu is the painfully shy junior high student who comes to stay at the Hianta apartments when her parents get a divorce, and Motoka is a turtle-phobic feminist samurai girl who doesn't take kindly to a male managing an all-girl apartment complex.  Plenty more memorable and (dare I say it?) loveable characters make their mark as the series progresses and the interpersonal dynamics between them never fail to produce hilarious and often touching results.  Keitaro's endeering geekiness as he pursues Naru, Naru sending Keitaro flying with punch after punch, Motoko chasing him with a sword after she catches him apparently peeping, Shinobu's awkwardness with the whole situation,  Su bouncing off the walls and building engines of destruction, Kitsune laying back with a drink in her hand and a big smile on her face as she watches it all go down, great, great stuff. Love Hina has really turned the whole romance-as-comedy genre on it's ear like Ranma 1/2 did back in the day and just went one step further by making the show more believable and emotional, but at the same time amping up the comedy to the ridiculous levels usually associated with shows like Excel Saga.  How they managed to pull this off is beyond me.  They even threw in some genius homages/spoofs to such classic films as Lady Snowblood, Mothra, Godzilla, Ultraman, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, fantasy RPG's in general, and much more. There's even an episode featuring Naru spoofing the whole Japanese pop-star/singer/voice-actress phenomenon which I can't help but see as a jab at the ubiquitous Megumi Hayashibara who has a bit part in the series as Keitaro's aunt Haruka (she also sings the series' theme song).  True anime fans will love this stuff. All in all, you get the original 24 episodes of the television series, the bonus 25th episode (my favorite), the Christmas and Spring movies, and the series finale 3-episode OVA which brings the series to a very satifying close.  You just can't beat this series, buy it now.",1095724800,78,3480,4.884550084889644
2105342,5,B0002MHE82,"There are few comedic works as good as Love Hina. Life in Hinata Hot Springs is a seemingly endless amusement, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud over and over again. Love Hina as an anime is only mildly less amusing than its manga counterpart, and reminds us that the only real reason we liked it in the first placed was for all the comedic violence.",1150761600,,359,4.454545454545454
2105343,4,B0002MHE82,"Love Hina came as a surprise for me. As an avid Ranma 1/2 fan, I've always enjoyed an ecclectic mix of action and comedy.  Love Hina is perhaps the first time I've ventured into the realm of pure romantic-comedy.  And this one certainly delivers.  The story is pure silliness with a dash of wit and heart-warming character development.  Although the ""good-natured nerdy guy love/hates beautiful girl"" is certainly a cliche, Love Hina still provides some moments of good fun.  Repeat viewing is certainly possible, although some episodes may drag on more than others (particularly the ""Spring Movie""). This boxed set completes the entire Love Hina series and OAVs in one-shot, and thus, is excellent value.",1147219200,,705,5.095652173913043

2105346,5,B0002MHE82,"I just have to say WOW!  This is one of the greatest series I've seen so far!  The characters just have such different personalities and interesting backgrounds!  I especially love the storyline and all that happens between Keitaro and the female tenants.

Okay, this story is about a guy named Keitaro Urashima who failed the entrance exams to Tokyo University 3 TIMES!  He then has to take over his grandma's job as manager of an ALL GIRLS dormatory.  Now he spends most of his days being beaten by the tenants .  First there's Naru, a violent/smart girl who Keitaro seems to fall in love with.  He is always at the wrong place at the wrong time and gets his butt whooped by her.  She tries to hide her feelings for him by calling him stupid and a dirty pervert.  Then you have Kitsune, She likes to drink most of the time and enjoys all the drama that happens between The tenants and Keitaro.  After her you have the Man-hater Motoko.  She always finds Keitaro at the wrong place at the wrong time many times.  She hates men and won't let one near her.  She is a master swordsman and slashes Keitaro for most of the series.  After her There is the loveable Kaolla-Su.  This Jr. High genius has a mysterious past.  She builds many dangerous objects that usually blows something up or causes some other sort of destruction.  Lastly you have the incredibly shy Shinobu.  She is in love with Keitaro but she is also extremely sensitive.

Well, that's pretty much it as for the characters.  Other than that there is all kinds of comedy and I just love it.  Oh, and for you Cowboy Bebop fans,  I'm sure you'll find Su very much like Ed.  This is a great series and worth each penny.",1125878400,3,1679,4.4295081967213115

There are so many quirks and differences between the characters that instead of making them annoying, make us love them. At first when my friend told me about it and told me what it was about, I thought it was going to be stupid and have no point at all. Well maybe there's no specific mission the characters have to achieve, but that's what makes it so fun!! It's a fun anime that will clear your head from whatever problem you have or anything that's bothering you and will transport you to a world of hot springs, girls and entrance exams. The characters are also in within reach, I mean that people can identify themselves with the characters because they're just regular kids messing around.

2105350,5,B0002MHE82,"if your a fan of anime this is series a must in my opinion, unlike some other animes that just sort of start out of nowhere this has a solid foundation and all good stories need a good foundation you will find yourself wondering what happens next.

love hina uses a very common theme with many girls and 1 regular guy, it may be overused but that doesnt make it bad, unlike some others like tenchi muyo all the girls aren't always trying to kill each other

some other animes have many ""filler"" episodes that don't really mean anything to the story but this series doesnt have a single ""filler"" episode, if its not about keitaro and naru it is centered around one of the other characters and i feel its nice to know their stories too instead of them just being ""extras"" in a sense by the end of the series you will know each character and watch them develop as the series progresses and that in my opinion character development is one of the most important things in any series cartoon or not this series definatly has that.

the ending is also a true ending, although the series was suppose to end with the spring special i would recommed watching the 3 episode love hina again OVA as well, that puts everything together and even though it may leave you wanting more i think its good to not have a series end in a cliffhanger. honestly if i knew ahead of time a series would be incomplete i don't think id even buy the series i want to have a true ending and this series has that.

love hina has a little bit of fan service but it is nothing serious, everything is covered up in the original love hina series. in love hina again there are a lot more suggestive scenes especially in the first episode, if you have any younger viewers who would watch this id recommed you check out the first episode of love hina again before you let younger viewers watch it and decide for yourself if its appropirate, the other two episodes are a little better there are some nearly nude shots especially from kanako who always seems to be parading around in her underwear but other than that its just a couple butt shots and all the other typical love hina stuff. i still recommed watching the full series though as it just doesnt feel like it ends with the spring special.

In my opinion, just forget about the dubbed version and watch it in Japanese (with subtitles, if necessary). The English dubbing is terrible, plagued with weird voices (Kitsune has a southern American accent for some reason), weird pronunciations of the characters' names, drawing out weird emphases on some odd syllables, and mistranslations all over the place.

8029461,3,B0002MHE82,"after reading so many glowing reviews, i have to admit that i was very underwhelmed with the Love Hina anime (and manga).  i agree with some of Angrymofo's comments and review that is buried somewhere down the comments list.

1.  at it's heart, it is a soap opera... who loves who and why.  that in itself is fine except that there is really only 1 main story - keitaro and naru.  and just when keitaro seems to have worked things out with his emotions... all of a sudden, Naru has issues.
2.  jokes are constantly repeated.  how many times can we see keitaro getting punched into the air after an inappropriate accident?  first time it was funny but, after the 15th time, it loses some impact.
3.  it is a story of insecurity.  every episode is basically someone being insecure.  (eg keitaro fails his test,  naru fails her test, motoko fails her test, shinobu is worried about failing her test...) again, i felt that this was a theme that was way too overdone (and frankly, my sympathy was wearing out b/c the insecurity was so stupid.  arguably, i guess they always are.)  and the plot devices are repetitive - just change the name of the person having the crisis.
4.  the characters that i liked the most were the most underdeveloped.  (mutsumi and mitsune).  24 (25) episodes and 3 ovas should be plenty to do more.  the manga does a better job.

what started out as an interesting and humorous series gradually turned into a tedious soap opera and one that i wished would just end.  i guess this type of anime is just not my cup of tea.

to be fair, there are moments that are quite funny and i had no problems w/ some of the ridiculous events that occur (since i don't expect logic in anime).  the only other humorous anime that i really enjoyed would be... maybe, Azumanga Daioh (5 stars, imo).",1189728000,,1802,4.46319018404908
8029462,5,B0002MHE82,"Love Hina is a funny anime about a clumsy 20 year old guy named Keitaro Urashima, 15 years back he made a promise to a little girl that when they grew up they would go to Tokyo University together and fall in love. The girl moved away so he never saw her again determined to keep that promise he has taken the exams to get into tokyo university and has failed them 3 times. He recieves a phone call from his grandmother asking him to visit so he goes to this Dorm that his grandmother owns and so when he gets there he goes into the Dorms hot spring and finds out it's an all girls dorm and one of the girls made a similar promise to someone to go to tokyo university. His grandmother wants to go traviling so she leaves keitaro in charge of the Dorm. I don't want to go and ruin anything by telling you anymore so I'll just say that he gets beat up a lot for peeping I felt kind of bad for Keitaro because it's never his fault when you gets beat up. This anime is filled with a lot of action.....well drama anyway including him getting beat up.",1186185600,,1045,4.077669902912621
8029463,5,B0002MHE82,"I have owned this set for a while now and I must say I am glade I put the money down.

This anime is packed full of emotion, but you need to remove the distractions and pay attention, you can miss a lot of things.

when you finish this show keep this in mind... the first season is 25 episodes long, and the 26th episode is the first episode of the second season. the second season was abandoned due to a major lack of money. I have done some searching and this is what I have found, the money brought in by DVD sales of the show raised enough money for the company to make a movie, the Love Hina Christmas  Movie. this movie follows the story further extending it. the money the company raised from this movie raised the funds for the next installment, Love Hina spring movie treating the Christmas  movie like a previous episode and going from there. The spring movie raised enough money that the company finished off love hina with a series called Love Hina Again! Love Hina Again is three episodes long and ends the series in a fast but great way.

It is very important that if you wish to finish the series after the perfect collection you need to watch them in this order, Christmas movie, Spring movie, then Love Hina Agian. They follow each other story wise and if you don't you will be confused and mad.",1174435200,,1312,4.317073170731708
8029464,5,B0002MHE82,"If you're looking for a anime to laugh at, this one if for you. I first started off reading the Manga, and thought of getting the series on dvd since I fell inlove with it. I cant stop watching. Its soooo funny. Although, I have to admit, I'd rather read then watch.",1171152000,,266,4.134615384615385
8029465,5,B0002MHE82,"I loved this series as a manga and thought the DVD would live up to the reputation. Indeed it did and I only had a few issues with it.

For one they gave Mitsune some odd southern accent, thankfully original jap voices and subs fixed that. Also the episodes seem slightly out of order and changed a bit. But other than that this is an excellent investment, Keitaro is oddly comparable to Kintaro from the series Golden boy, though Kietaro is only perverted by accident (well mostly)

Either way I would reccomend picking this up, no anime collection can be complete without it.",1170979200,,577,4.592233009708738
8029466,5,B0002MHE82,"I typically dislike these sort of fanservicey-plot-thin romps, but I have to say Love Hina is probably a standout in this category.  Of course, there isn't really much competition to be the best of this category, but I wouldn't be ashamed to say I really like this series.  True, it has a little too much obvious fanservice for my tastes, but all the same, it's a really great cast of likeable characters and a nice story.  The manga expands on the story more, but it has even more fanservice then the anime.

The story and plot synopsis can be found all of the internet, so I won't go into that here.  Basically what I will say is the show succeeds as a comedy because it is very funny, but a surprise is that's it's also a surprisingly well done romance story as well.  It isn't always top notch but it is definitely entertaining the whole way through, and when it's over, you'll be almost definitely left with an imprint in your mind of the show's likeable characters and enjoyable plotlines.  There are also some geniunely well done moments, like when Keitaro (main character) first visits Toudai when he believes to have failed his exams.

Perhaps it's not a masterpiece of storytelling, but I believe that despite it's faults it's a worthwhile series, mostly because of it's great cast.",1150848000,2,1292,4.635964912280702
8029467,5,B0002MHE82,"I usually don't like these kind of animes, for good reason, but I wouldn't call this show a fanservicey-harem show like so many others do, simply because I don't think it does the show justice.  It's true I've watched other animes with deeper plots, more emotional climaxes, intelligent writing, etc.  but somehow this series is still a favourite of mine and many others.  It's a phenomenon that I can't explain, but I hope that all the other viewers won't view this show with the bias I originally had when viewing it.  It's been 6 long years and Love Hina is still popular, and there is a reason for that.",1150848000,2,607,4.541284403669724
