6381564,5,B00JM5CB56,"I purchaced this dvd because I love watching Too Cute. It's one of my favorite shows and I think it's worth buying them on dvd if/when available. I keep buying this show on dvd if they keep coming. This set only has the first 8 episodes from season 2. Here's a list:

Disc 1
fluffy puppies & baby goats
jungle kitties & baby skunks
fuzzy polar puppies
spotted, pampered pups

Disc 2
sweetest animal friends
fluffy puppy party
cuddly kittens
puppy love

It may only be half the season, but it's still worth buying if you like that show or love pets of all sorts. This show is fun to watch and educational. It's a fun way of learning about other breeds. I think Too Cute is one of the best animal shows ever created. Watching these baby animals at play or even in mischief will simply get you hooked. I would call this set a must have for pet lovers.
One bit of advice, buy it only for viewing enjoyment at home, not for considering a new pet. That's what I did.",1421539200,13,960,4.2349726775956285
