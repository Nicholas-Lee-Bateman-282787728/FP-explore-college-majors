7857418,3,6303955975,"Hosted by Richard Dreyfuss this is a story of a man who aspired to be in the clothing business.  When he saw a line of people down the block to go into a theatre he decided the movie business appeared to be a wise direction.  He assembled what eventually became Universal Studios.

Originally the studio was big into the monster movies.  Clips are shown and some behind the scenes are presented.  By 1936 the studio was broke.

Eventual young stars such as Clint Eastwood in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Francis-the-Talking-Mule/dp/B006TTC55E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Francis the Talking Mule</a>&nbsp;appear in perhaps never before seen clips by some, suprising. Some star interviews.

Eventually there were color movies and they were shooting TV shows on the lot, famous directors speak and some more behind the scenes that are insightful.  Eventually it becomes like a commercial for the studio as it had been recently sold again and it appears that this might be an attempt to promote some previously forgotten movies to be rented, bought. Made in 1995, two hours long. Interesting.",1377907200,,1134,5.590643274853801

So there's much that can be added to bring it up to date, especially while Universal is celebrating its 100th Anniversary. I hope the studio releases an updated version on DVD.",1373846400,2,321,4.962962962962963
7857420,4,6303955975,"The Universal Story is one about a studio that wasn't always in the forefront of the public's mind but which consistently released memorable films. In fact, the studio's heyday seemed to flourish after the star system ended and when Steven Spielberg was put under contract.

The story begins with Carl Lammlae creating IMP studios and acquiring Mary Pickford to star. In 1915, the studio became Universal Studios and produced many silent films that visitors could see being made. When sound came, the studio tours ceased, but several interesting films were made including some early musicals and the projects of Lammlae Jr. like All Quiet on the Western Front. As time went on, it seemed that Universal struggled to find major stars, although they let many noteworthy faces of the golden age of Hollywood slip through their gates. Some did well, including baby faced Deanna Durbin. The 1960s created some epic films like Spartacus and ushered in a new era of film making. Films like American Graffiti and Jaws set a new standard. They made way for stylized films like ET and Jurassic Park.

Richard Dreyfuss is the host, but the program is littered with voice-overs from stars ranging from Pickford to Sigourney Weaver to Spielberg. It is entertaining, but too short to get into any major details about any era or film.",1176422400,3,1319,4.936936936936937
