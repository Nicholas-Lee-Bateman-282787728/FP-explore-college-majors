7976184,2,B00007G1UF,I got this dvd today March 19th from a used cd and dvd store and this is going back March 20th. When I got it home I looked at the reviews for it and saw it was only rated 2 stars and found out the review was wright. The only good movie on here is shaolin vs. manchu the others aren't even worth buying or watching It was like watching soap operas from another country. The biggest thing about this is that the dvd cover basically misleads into thinking wow this must be action packed and It's not It's like watching kids play with plastic swords and throwing red paint on themselves when one of them wins. The first movie Hero's blood didn't have one hero throughout it I could of been the hero because nobody in the movie could fight. The picture was very poor It might as well have been on VHS you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. In a way giving this 2 stars is being nice but shaolin vs. manchu gets the 2nd star.,1111104000,,926,4.15
7976185,2,B00007G1UF,"This collection has two DVDs with 4 movies.  However only one is worth watching...Shaolin vs Manchu.  I would have given this movie 3 stars but the other crap that came with it renders the package a 2 star deal.  I suggest you buy Shaolin vs Manchu for $4.99 unless of course you don't mind paying $5 extra for three ""kung-fu"" movies that are utter crap.",1080518400,10,354,4.415384615384616
