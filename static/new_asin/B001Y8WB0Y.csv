3829608,4,B001Y8WB0Y,"First, Hiromi, her bassist, and her drummer are all COMPLETELY OFF THE HOOK!!! All are masters.

Second, the jazz they perform in this concert is definitely ""out."" If you don't like that kind of jazz, you may find this disc hard to listen to.

Third, the video is not only not Blu-Ray, but it's not even 16:9!!! It was probably recorded in HD, but it was burned onto this DVD as 16:9 inside 4:3. Additionally, I would say the transfer wasn't done very well. From the first second I saw it, I thought the contrast was pretty poor. Although that's very disappointing to me, I took off only 1 star for it because the concert is so great.",1288915200,3,634,4.364406779661017

3829610,5,B001Y8WB0Y,"I enjoyed watching and hearing the DVD, I was amaze!! She brings you into the concert... I watched it for the second time, never boring.",1277683200,,136,4.48
3829611,5,B001Y8WB0Y,"The quality is great and music is powerful.  Warning, this is not for the narrow minded / casual music listener.  This is a challenging video in that your brain will start going places musically that you've never been before.  Very Exciting and extrememly technical, yet still progressive Jazz.  Hiromi and her band are SSSSSSSSMMMMMOKIN'!!  Get this thing and watch it over and over and grab what you can from it.  Fantastic!",1271462400,7,426,4.929577464788732
3829612,5,B001Y8WB0Y,"Absolutely brilliant! Having just watched this, I almost feel out of breath from the sheer intensity of the thing! At one point, I wondered if Hiromi sleeps on her piano each night- she's so in touch with the instrument!
  Hiromi's bassist, Tony Grey and drummer, Martin Valihora, are also amazing, and no one lets up for a second! Martin's eyes seem to be constantly locked onto Hiromi's, both creating and feeding off each other's unrelenting energy!
  I was blown away by her other DVD, ""Sonic Bloom"", but I think I like this one even better!
  Here, Hiromi pretty much sticks with her Grand piano the entire time, except for early on during part of one piece, when she plays chords with her left hand on the little synth, atop her piano.
  More than once, I got a little ""choked up"", not because of some sad beautiful piece, but actually because of the joy and momentum resulting from the remarkable fever pitch to which she would rhythmically, and physically tear into her instrument, with absolute unabashed abandon! In fact, on occasion there's something about the way that energy lifts her off her seat that's rather pleasing to the eye, even though you get the feeling she's not at all trying to look sexy- something to do with ecstatic electric kinetic energy, I suppose!
  Anyway, out of several excellent music concert DVDs I have, this is absolutely one of the very best, or possibly ""the"" very best one I have! Hiromi deserves to win a Grammy for each song performed, let alone being one of the most incredible players on the planet!",1261008000,19,1547,4.696296296296296

8347987,5,B001Y8WB0Y,"This trio can be seen as an early version of her incredible ""Trio Project"".  I heard the latter group first, so it took a while for me to warm up to the earlier group.  Jeez, sometimes you have to stop comparing and just enjoy.

Anyway, this is another fantastic trio.  Bassist is really also a pseudo-guitarist very influenced by Metheny and Jaco.  Drummer is a frenetic (but controlled) energy machine.  Hiromi, of course, is ""SUPER FREAKY AMAZING WOW NICE!!!"" to use some Japanese-inflected English.

Kudos also for the visual team -- this is perfect, you always see what you want to see, and the camera moves just enough.",1462147200,2,625,4.731481481481482

8347992,5,B001Y8WB0Y,Hiromi is one of the most exciting musicians you could ever see and this DVD doesn't disappoint.  Video and audio quality are decent if not great.  She's a joy to watch and her band mates are too.,1347408000,,196,4.27027027027027
8347993,5,B001Y8WB0Y,"This trio is incredible. The music itself is gorgeous, and watching them perform it doubles the pleasure. This concert is perfect to play in the background of your life, or watch intently.",1346457600,,188,4.90625
8347994,4,B001Y8WB0Y,"Great DVD, great music! Bassist and drummer are also incredible! Hiromi's music is something that not most people would like but if you are open to fusion of jazz and rock, you'll definitely like it. after watching this, I purchased all her available DVDs on Amazon.
One thing I didn't like about this DVD is that there are no special/bonus features like interviews, documentations before the shows, etc. Its all plain music with track/scene selection. the DVD menu is not even animated, just a plain still background image. I'm a post production artist before, that's why I comment on these things. And because of the poor DVD authoring I'm giving it 4 stars.

But all in all, I'm happy with this DVD.",1302134400,3,702,4.754098360655738
