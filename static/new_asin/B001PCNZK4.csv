3746902,1,B001PCNZK4,"Toilet humor within the first five minutes, unlikable characters and poor animation. It's a pity the first cartoon for Filipino-Americans is so very poor. Everyone involved had zero experience or even common sense when creating this ""cartoon."" Even worse is they have an obsession with older man with huge bulges in their pants.

Skip this just...skip this and keep running.",1316649600,5,374,5.233333333333333
8332993,5,B001PCNZK4,This cartoon is possibly my absolute favorite! Don't listen to the reviewrs on youtube talking smack because of its humor! Family guy and especially American dad are x1000 times worse shows and get seemingly no backlash when they make the same jokes this show makes! I hope they make a season 3!,1504483200,,295,4.6923076923076925

8333000,5,B001PCNZK4,"This overlooked anime is so underrated. Even though it's underrated, I would consider it better than Attack on Titan, JoJo, Pokemon, Bleach, Fairytail, Full Metal Alchemist, and Naruto. It's that good. If you're looking for a show about lovable characters, great plot, and amazing animation, this is the show for you!",1476057600,27,317,5.235294117647059
