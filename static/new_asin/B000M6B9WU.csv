2725965,4,B000M6B9WU,"THE BLACK CAMEL is the second, and oldest surviving, film in the 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan series--and the only surviving film in the series that was based directly on a novel by Charlie Chan's creator, author Earl Derr Biggers.  It is distinctly unlike all other Chan films in style and tone.

The story, which is loosely based on the notorious William Desmond Taylor murder case, finds a flock of Hollywood actors on the loose in Honolulu, a flock which includes star Shelia Fane (Dorothy Revier) and her ward Julie (Sally Eilers.)  Enamoured of Shelia has become enamoured of Alan Jaynes (William Post Jr.), but for some undisclosed reason she is hesitant to marry him and she sends for famous Hollywood psychic Tarneverro (Bela Lugosi.)  After a brutal crystal gazing session with Tarneverro, Shelia announces that she cannot marry Alan--and is then found unexpectedly murdered in a bungalow outside her lavish home.  Charlie Chan, played here by Warner Oland, is quickly on the scene, and persistently frustrated by Julie, Shelia's maid Anna (Violet Dunn), buther Jessop (Dwight Frye) and half a dozen others who seem to have something to hide.  He is also greatly annoyed by his Japanese assistant Kashimo (Otto Yamaoka) an incompent associate with the distinct tendency to get in the way of Chan's investigation.  Although he appeared in various Chan novels, this is the character's only screen appearance, and the bumbling Kashimo seems in some ways to have inspired the parts of Chan's various sons.  The film is also notable for the appearance of Robert Young in the role of Jimmy Bradshaw, Julie's admirer; although he had appeared in an earlier short, THE BLACK CAMEL showed him up well, and his career as both supporting actor and leading man would last for almost sixty years.

THE BLACK CAMEL is particularly memorable for its use of location--it was one of the few films of its era to be shot primarily on location--and for cinematographers Joseph August and Daniel Clark and director Hamilton McFadden, who directed three Chan films and appeared in three, including a bit part as a Hollywood director in THE BLACK CAMEL.  McFadden was widely admired for set pieces, and many felt he had a notable career ahead of him--but his notions about film-making gradually proved too expensive for the studio, which gradually phased him out.  It is a pity, for although THE BLACK CAMEL is indeed an early talkie, and therefore somewhat clunky, it is surprising at how smooth it plays when compared against other films of the time.

THE BLACK CAMEL DVD includes a very interesting audio commentary by Ken Hanke and John Clark, a restoration comparison, some stills, and CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE: A RECREATION OF A LOST CHARLIE CHAN MOVIE.  The latter, which is presented as a series of stills that survive from this lost film shown over nearly recorded dialogue from the surviving script, is actually less interesting than you might imagine; it is so ridiculously overplayed that it feels more like an Ed Wood production than a Charlie Chan movie.  But this aside, THE BLACK CAMEL is a uniquely interesting Chan movie, and I recommend it to Chan fans everywhere.

2725966,5,B000M6B9WU,"This potpourri of Egypt, ancient excavations with curses attached, murder and Charlie Chan has an aroma of fun that never wavers for the entire seventy-two minute running time. For film buffs, it is a chance to see lovely Pat Paterson onscreen also. Louis King directed the screenplay of Robert Ellis and Helen Logan. Rita Hayworth fans will enjoy her small early role as Nayda. The pace is perfect, the mystery and romance blended nicely by King.

Warner Oland brought a quiet dignity to the detective created by the talented Earl Derr Biggers. Though Toler is probably my favorite of the two Chans, taking over the role in 1938 when Oland fell ill and succumbed to pneumonia in his country of birth, Sweden, Oland was excellent, lending class and an air of distinction to Chan. Charlie Chan in Egypt is one of Oland's most fun turns as the famous sleuth. It starts off with a bang, in something resembling a scene from The Mummy; a man dropping dead during the unearthing of an ancient Egyptian room full of artifacts. A figure watching over the room may be bringing a curse upon those who've disturbed the site. Chan is sent by the French Museum to discover why various artifacts excavated are finding their way into private hands instead of theirs.

More is amiss than just the missing artifacts, however, as Charlie soon discovers. Archeologist Tom Evans (Thomas Beck) proves to be his ally with many mysteries. Evans is sweet on Carol Arnold (Pat Paterson), the daughter of the expedition leader, now missing. It isn't long until Charlie discovers his body in an Egyptian sarcophagus, and knows there is a murderer about, helping the curse come true. Tom and Carol have romantic feelings for one another, of course, and Chan is disturbed by her bouts of illness which he suspects also have a very earthly cause. A second death soon transpires, and Chan's reputation is in doubt for a short time.

Thanks to our favorite Hawaiian detective, Carol is no longer under the spell of the poison she was being given, which proves handy when Tom is shot helping Charlie find a killer's secret. Chan appears to be defeated but, of course, is only setting a trap. There is a bit of misdirection which will have the viewer suspecting everyone except the scared Snowshoes (Stepinfetchit) who wants nothing to do with curses and murder. A very nice ending wraps up both the mystery and the romance in this one. Fox gave this one a big boost with some fine sets, lending a fun atmosphere to a tight little mystery with just the right amount of romance.

The romance between Beck and Paterson is quite nice, Beck making a solid romantic hero. Paterson is lovely here, and a big plus for film buffs. She married Charles Boyer on Valentine's Day in 1934, and when she died in 1978, Boyer took his own two days later, unable and unwilling to live without her. A fun film and excellent Charlie Chan entry with a sweet reminder of love the way it is supposed to be for those who know the story. If you can't find this fabulous one, it is also part of a boxed set, and well worth the price. A great time at the movies.",1263600000,2,3103,4.626134301270417
2725967,5,B000M6B9WU,"The last time I saw this movie was on WGN TV in Chicago in 1970!  I was thrilled to see it on DVD and couldn't wait to get a copy.  I remember it as being one of the best in the series of Charlie Chan films - and my memory was correct.  Although a low budget film - it is a great one, very entertaining! The story line has alot of twists and turns - and the exotic Egyptian setting adds a mysterious atmosphere. Oh, and here's some trivia.  This was one of Woody Allen's favorite old films as well.  He based the character played by Jeff Daniels - in ""The Purple Rose of Cario"" - on the handsome archeologist in this one.",1259107200,,621,4.016260162601626
2725968,4,B000M6B9WU,"Charlie Chan in Egypt is based on an original screen play so don't look back into any of the Earl Derr Biggers' novels for insights into this plot. This film is one of the last ones done by Warner Oland, the original actor who portrayed Charlie Chan.  In this movie, the studio was obviously trying to tell a good story without spending much money.  The result is surprisingly good.

Having not seen this movie for many years, I was concerned when I saw that Stepin Fetchit was in the cast. Although the role certainly plays on stereotypes about African-Americans (laziness, fearfulness, and drunkenness), the effect wasn't nearly as bad as I feared from some of the other movies in the series where Chinese stereotypes are much too deeply reinforced. Stepin Fetchit comes across more like a reasonable man who is put upon by foolish employers than as an ex-slave who cringes at the sight of a white man.

The strength of the movie comes in the excellent atmosphere created by visiting an Egyptian crypt and a professor's laboratory inside a darkness-shrouded house.  There's a heavy mood of danger and dread that infects the actors and the story.  You'll get hints of curses, crooks, and obsession. The atmosphere is superbly set in context by having Charlie arrive by plane and taking a barn-storming tour over the Sphinx and major pyramids.

Like the best of the Charlie Chan stories, this film has some excellent science involved to help explain the mysteries and murders.

An unexpected treat is to have the young Rita Hayworth (playing under the  name of Rita Cansino) decoratively walking across the rooms in an attractive native costume.  Although no one will mistake her for an Egyptian, she certainly adds to the scenery.

The film's main weakness is that the identity of the murderer is pretty easy to figure out.

The DVD also has a short feature on an exemplary Chinese-Hawaiian detective in Honolulu who was operating there when Earl Derr Biggers visited the islands. Biggers probably got the idea for having a Chinese detective from this man, but little else seems to have been based on the real detective who mostly worked on drug and gambling cases in the Chinese community and was famous for carrying a bull whip to enforce the law.",1206921600,2,2250,4.830729166666667
2725969,4,B000M6B9WU,"Why is it that Egypt is such an interesting place? It always seems to attract me, no matter how bad the story is. Thankfully, this movie is not bad at all. A group of archaeologists go to Egypt to recover the tomb of an important man. They run into trouble when a greedy criminal decides to take matters into his own hands, but with the guise of an ancient curse to his credit, it takes those involved a long time to discover his identity, or that there is even a crime being committed. Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) is sent to clear matters up, but his slow and deliberate method makes some people uneasy.

The mystery is quite standard and the characters are very typical of this genre. The film is simply an enjoyable ride, but nothing too special. It does boast an early screen appearance by Rita Hayworth, here working under her real name of Cansino. Her dark hair helps disguise her. Another notable performer is Stepin Fetchit, one of the most controversial black actors of his time. His lazy persona can be quite offensive, but as a comedian, he is a riot to watch. There are several times when he lightens the mood with his casual quips and distinctive personality. Thank goodness he actually has enough screen time to make a good impression. Conversely, Oland is much more subtle in his performance as an Asian man. Sometimes his English is broken and he observes more than he speaks, but his characterization is hardly upsetting and provides an excellent backbone for a story with so much chaos.",1197849600,2,1504,4.632958801498128
2725970,2,B000M6B9WU,"Parents, do not let your children view this movie without watching it yourself ahead of time.
It is ""g"" rated, but contains a number of very disturbing elements which make it unsuitable for children.

There are so many reasons to watch this classic movie - and one unfortunate reason which makes it terribly difficult to sit through - Stephin Fetchit.  Many of you may never have seen Stephin Fetchit perform in movies.  He was added as ""comic relief"" playing a character that depicted black males as lazy, easily frightened and so on.  His characterizations are easily the most racially offensive scenes ever filmed for American movies.

And now for the reasons to see this movie. It features the actress Pat Paterson. Ms. Paterson was a ""luminous blonde"" - she was certainly one of the most beautiful women in movies.  Her career lasted only a few years. After marrying Actor Charles Boyer, she retired from films.

This movie also features a seventeen year old Rita Haworth in one of her first movies.  This is well before she became ""Gilda"". In this movie she is still somewhat awkward and even chubby.  She plays an Egyptian house maid.  Fans of the actress will enjoy seeing this early role - if only to note how different she was from the characters she played only a few years later.

In terms of a murder mystery thus movie is one of the better ones in the series. It has high productions values ( for a ""B"" picture).  The writing is top notch, the mystery elements hold up well even after all these years.

If Stephin Fetchit was not in the movie , I would give it  four and a half stars.
Since he is in about every other scene. I rate it a two.",1400889600,3,1655,4.510067114093959
2725971,5,B000M6B9WU,This is the oldest Chan movie that's available.  It has some wonderful actors in it including Bela Lugosi and a very young Robert Young.  If you enjoy the old black and white Charlie Chan's this one is a must see.,1400630400,2,213,4.3
2725972,4,B000M6B9WU,"This is probably one of the oldest movies I've ever watched-released in 1931. The film features a very engaging mystery surrounding the murder of a Hollywood starlet in Honolulu. The movie does feature some actors who are struggling with adapting to to the talkie era with some overacting and stilted scenes. And there's  a weird line where a character refers to something as an old Hollywood tradition which was weird had been a motion picture town for less than 20 years so had no time to develop old traditions.

However, the movie just can't help being good. Warner Oland is in command as Charlie Chan and the comic relief works as well. Bela Luguosi brings great star power to the supporting role and the film remains just great after all these years.",1380931200,2,756,4.71969696969697
2725973,4,B000M6B9WU,"The Charlie Chan franchise had only just got off the ground when this was made. Filmed partly in Hawaii, with opening shots of surfing (!!) this is a great little movie. With Lugosi as the mysterious but suave Tarnaverro, horror fans (or should I say, Dracula fans) get the added bonus of seeing Dwight Frye as a suspect in the seemingly impossible-to-solve murder.

Good to see Lugosi in a non-horror role and having a grand time as well.",1360454400,2,439,4.628205128205129
2725974,5,B000M6B9WU,"A great vintage 30's movie, filmed on location in Hawaii. The commentary was so interesting. There was a bonus, which was a recreation of one of the lost Charlie Chan movies using voice over actors, stills from the original movie and flashes of the original script. It was so well done. This is a great DVD.",1358553600,,307,4.5
2725975,4,B000M6B9WU,"The same year Bela Lugosi played his seminal role in Dracula, he also played a mystic in the film, Charlie Chan and The Black Camel.  ""Black Camel"" is Charlie's metaphor for death.

Celebrities:  It was also a treat to see Dwight Frye play the evil butler; he too recently came off Dracula, playing the vampire slave, Jonathan Harker, in 1931's Dracula.  Warner Oland plays the lead as Chinese detective Charlie Chan.  You get used to the overdone accent and the fact that he is actually a Swedish actor does escape you.

Robert Young, star of TV's Marcus Welby, M.D., makes his first appearance here in his overly done eye make-up, playing the lover of a woman who wants to protect the reputation of the girl who was murdered, yadda yadda yadda.

From what I understand, this film was the first one found for the Charlie Chan series; the other two were lost in a studio fire.  It's great to see Bela Lugosi as a bright, intelligent young man at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, offering to help Charlie in solving the crime of the death of a starlet, who herself has a dark past.  Bela played the fortune-teller for that same starlet.

The story is nearly the same plot as the later Charlie adventure, ""Charlie Chan at Rio"" - one could almost call it a remake, though I'm sure that was not the intention.  I won't give too much away, but the miffed girl, the pin in the shoe, the mysterious death, it's all the same.

There's also the goofball assistant of Charlie's who makes his only appearance of the series in this film - the humor with this guy is quite dated - and the studios went with the sons of Charlie to play the foil!  The dinner table with Charlie, his wife and eight kids is priceless!",1324339200,2,1694,4.461038961038961
2725976,3,B000M6B9WU,"""The Black Camel"" (1931) remains the earliest surviving Charlie Chan mystery starring Warner Oland. Evocatively filmed in Honolulu, the Fox production benefits from the strong rapport between Oland and Bela Lugosi (truly mesmerizing in one of his first red herring roles)  not to mention the handsome cinematography by Joseph August and Daniel B. Clark. A bit creaky and slow-moving, but most rewarding for Oland and Lugosi fans. Transferred from a nice 35mm print.",1322179200,4,465,5.36986301369863
2725977,5,B000M6B9WU,"Chan is sent to Egypt by the French Archeological Society in Paris in this 1935 film to find out why certain items that were excavated from a tomb and were supposed to be sent to the Society were stolen and ended up in other museums. Chan discovers that the man who ran the excavations was murdered. While Chan is still in Egypt, this man's son is also murdered. There are a number of suspects, including the man's daughter who hates her father, her boy friend who her father dismissed from his job, her uncle who is hiding something, the uncle's assistant who is overprotective of Egyptian finds, the uncle's female helper who sneaks around watching what people are doing, and the family doctor who may be administering drugs to the daughter. Claims are made against Chan that he is incompetent and the cause of the son's death.

 Chan's son is not in this film. Instead the very competent actor Stepin Fetchit plays, as he usually does, a stereotypical ignorant black man. He shuffles, shakes, whines, walks as if he is made of rubber, and is constantly scared. Fetchit is given the ridiculous name Snowshoes. He respond to everyone, ""Yes'm,"" even to men. Humor is also added in a couple of scenes by an Arab swindler who tells Fetchit that he can reveal information about Fetchit's great great ancestors.

 Chan typically offers many witty epigrams, true, but stated in a humorous way, including: Drop of water on thirsty tongue is more worth than gold. Waiting for tomorrow is waste of today. Cannot read book until pages are cut. Theories like mist on eyeglasses, obscures facts. Impossible to develop defense until direction of attack is known. Journey of life is like feather on water, must go with stream.",1320278400,,1713,4.777027027027027

Charlie Chan is called, he takes Tarneverro along. Was Shelah killed because she knew who killed Denny Mayo? Does a smashed wristwatch show the time of the murder?

Chan notices a footprint in the sand. When a group is gathered the lights go out! Part of a letter is missing. Are the two murders connected? Does Chan need a lie detector? There are pieces of a torn photograph. The former husband of Shelah arrives, he explains his actions. He makes a surprising statement! Chan explains why it isn't true. There is a letter under a rug.

Chan accepts the case, and goes about searching for clues as to the whereabouts of this missing archeologist, along side ""Stepin Fetchit"", a black actor who quite possibly gives the most stereotyped performance ever captured on celluloid.  Without this awful, distasteful inclusion, the film may have been truly suspenseful, and adding to the 'Mummy"" milieu of the early 1930's, a cut above B-Movie status.  However the film drags in spots, and the story gets convoluted more and more before ending as Chan uncovers the real murderer.

First the Swedish actor, Warner Oland, helped make the series a success at Fox during the early and mid thirties, with the English actor, Sidney Toler, his first and best successor. This is an admirable effort in the first period of its history, with Oland quite effective as the Chinese-American detective and a decent supporting cast. Hardly recognizable in the cast is Rita Hayworth in the role of a maid. A bit of Film history to spice the action.

Putting aside its (correctly) rejected stereotypy of ""The Black Man"", it is simply as annoying today, as it was to me during the Depression when we watched it on ""Children's Day"" (Saturday....had to do homework on weekdays). (Apparently, it was very popular with moviegoers since he is said to have been the first Black actor to have become a millionaire----wealth he lost following his retirement. (Wiki).
It is possible that his character will so distress you as to prevent you from enjoying this film. I think many, today, will wisely refrain from watching. Others will be able to cope and they should find this an otherwise well done minor film.",1432339200,,1540,4.9192307692307695
