560838,5,6303112129,"Truly one of the greatest Hammer Films of the 1970s. Screenwriter/Producer Brian Clemens brings a breath of fresh air to the Hammer establishment that had been missing for some time. Bizarre and inventive, without being exploitive, Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde is a gloomy amd atmospheric Victorian horror. Everything is played seriously, which makes the film more believable and enjoyable. The two leads are perfectly cast. Martine Beswick is menacing as Sister Hyde without being camp, and Ralph Bates puts in a sensitive and understated performance as Dr. Jekyll. Roy Ward Baker's snappy direction compliments everything nicely. The score by David Whitaker adds much to the proceedings. As usual Anchor Bay has put together a great package for an underappreciated film. Presented uncut, the picture appears slightly grainy, no doubt due to the dense fog in much of the story. Otherwise it is a fine transfer. Also included is a fun and informative commentary, talent bios, and radio spots. The real treat is the photo gallery, not because of the photos themselves, but because the rich score accompanies it. A fine treat.",1011744000,4,1122,5.170329670329671

560840,5,6303112129,"Seemingly neglected for years by the usual Hammer crowd, due perhaps to the schlocky, sensationalistic promotional ad campaign by distributor AIP here in the States, or the presumed staleness of the time-worn source material, Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde actually holds up today as one of late-period Hammer's better horror efforts. Not surprising considering the talent behind it, particularly director Roy Ward Baker (whose numerous genre credits include Asylum, The Vampire Lovers, Quatermass and the Pit, and the superior Titanic-flick A Night to Remember), writer Brian Clemens (Avengers, Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos), and producer Albert Fennell (Avengers, Burn Witch Burn, Captain Kronos). Originating as a joke idea tossed out by Clemens at a dinner party, the script's sex-change twist, as presented in the movie, is really not much more incredible than Stevenson's original dual-personality concept, and is worked both for shocks and some wicked humor. The screenplay interweaves multiple subplots (including bits borrowed from the Jack the Ripper and Burke and Hare mythos) with several moderately gory murders and some brief nudity, faltering only slightly at the somewhat anticlimactic finish. The metamorphoses of Jekyll (Ralph Bates) into ""sister"" Hyde (Martine Beswick) and back are accomplished on-camera in a number of clever ways that DO NOT involve the traditional makeup-and-lap-dissolve techniques (and are all the more effective for it), and the basic physical resemblance between Bates and Beswick is close enough to really sell the effect. Overall one of late-era Hammer's few really respectable efforts, worth a serious look for fans of the studio's output or Jekyll-and-Hyde completists.
Once again Anchor Bay's DVD puts to shame most efforts by bigger video companies on ""bigger"" films. The uncut, 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen source print is bright, sharp, and detailed, with excellent color and contrast, and virtually spotless. Extras include a super-clean widescreen trailer, radio spots, poster and still gallery, filmographies, French language track, and audio commentary by Beswick, Baker, and Clemens. While less animated and 'dishy' than some (see Anchor's Lust for a Vampire DVD), the wide-ranging discussion is still quite interesting for fans of the film or the work of any of the principals. In sum: yet another classy, definitive release from Anchor and a must-have DVD for Hammer aficionados. Four stars for the movie; five for the DVD.",1009584000,4,2489,5.569920844327177
560841,5,6303112129,"DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE is a very good movie. This is the bizaar tale of how one man-and one woman try to exist in the same body. RALPH BATES plays Dr. Jekyll, a man working on a potion that will change him forever. MARTINE BESWICK plays evil SISTER HYDE and goes on a killing rampage. The plot twists when she falls in love with another man, complicating Mr. Hyde's character. At times, this movie tries to be romantic, but in the end, it all ends up tragic! A very different horror movie from most Hammer films. I guess that's why I recommend it, because it is different.

When  he drinks the elixar he turns into the evil sister Hyde for a short period  of time, but the periods get longer each time he swallows the elixar.  Eventually the two halves are battling for control of the same body while  the police are hot on the trail of the White Chapel killer.  This film  often times tilts between being interesting and awkward, but ultimately  good performances by Bates and Beswick pull it over to the above average  level. There are way too many foggy night scenes and if I were Jekyll, I  would have offed the girl who sings first. The story manages to maintain  one's interest and it moves along fairly well.

560988,3,6303112129,"A twist on the original Robert Louis Stevenson tale, where instead of experimenting on personality changes, Dr. Jekyll in this tale experiments on female hormones to extend life with horrific results!

The good doctor realizes that he may not live long enough to come up with cures for various diseases so he experiments on longevity instead.  He seeks cadavers for a supply of glands from women, but as his experiments and Sister Hyde demand, he starts hunting for fresher game.

There is the struggle of good vs. evil, even in this plot.  But the film misses the potential it has in exploring sexual identity and struggle.  And, sorry to say it, but where do the man's ""family jewels"" disappear to and how can his hair change from long to short in a blink?

The first time he changes to Ms. Hyde, she rips off her shirt and laughs.  My, my.  Outside of this titulating (pun intended) scene, there doesn't seem to be a big surprise here.

Both personalities flirting with the brother and sister neighbors upstairs is cute.  The gruesome murders complete with blood and knives sticking out of throats makes me wonder as to the PG rating.

Ghastly, and sometimes inadvertently funny, this go at Stevenson's story is a fun laugh if you have nothing else better to do.  Or better yet, just read the book!

Hammer Studios knocked this one out, with Ralph Bates as the star.

Although it may not provide the kinky thrills that the ads promised for this when it was first released, it's got some chilling passages and a terrific climax.  Very good cast, particularly Ralph Bates who makes the character sympathetic, which isn't easy as prior to the advent of Sister Hyde he is Jack the Ripper, let's face it.  (I also liked that the goody-two-shoes heroine is so believable as well, which I think is a Clemens touch.  She's very well played.)  Just like Captain Kronos, Clemens is on hand for a terrific commentary track.",1231027200,,742,4.72093023255814
560990,4,6303112129,"Was this the best theatrical version of Jack the Ripper I've ever seen?  Or was it the best theatrical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?  All I know is that Hammer Film Productions produced another winner with ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde.""  According to this tale of gothic horror, the infamous Jack the Ripper was actually Dr. Jekyll.

  Dr. Jekyll is working hard to find the elixir of eternal life.  Female hormones seem to be the solution.  At first he acquires fresh corpses of young women from two unscrupulous grave robbers.  Unfortunately, when the grave robbers are brought to justice, the good doctor must begin killing prostitutes in order to acquire the female hormones.

  Dr. Jekyll drinks the elixir which has an unexpected side effect.  He turns into his female alter ego.  He tells everyone that the woman staying with him is his divorced sister, Mrs. Hyde.  Soon Mrs. Hyde begins plotting to kill everyone in Dr. Jekyll's life in order to become the dominant personality.

  Fog enshrouded sets, gorgeous costumes, a great musical score, bloody violence, and great acting from the leads create an unforgettable experience in gothic horror.  Hammer veterans Ralph Bates (""Taste the Blood of Dracula,"" ""The Horror of Frankenstein,"" and ""Lust for a Vampire"") and Martine Beswick (""Prehistoric Women"" and ""One Million Years B.C."") are perfect as the rival siblings.  They actually could pass as twins.  They bare a striking resemblance.

  The upstairs neighbor, Howard (Lewis Fiander of Narcisco Ibanez Serrador`s ""Who Can Kill a Child?""), falls in love with the divorced Mrs. Hyde.  Meanwhile, Howard's sister, Susan (Susan Broderick), falls in love with Dr. Jekyll.  This leads to quite a dilemma.

  ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde"" is highly recommended for fans of gothic horror, Hammer Film Productions, and the legend of Jack the Ripper.  Don't let the title fool you.  This film is serious horror and well ahead of its time in regards to gender confusion.  Audiences in the early seventies must've been extremely repulsed by the idea of a man buying beautiful red gowns because he is confused about his sexuality.",1221523200,5,2134,5.043103448275862

560992,5,6303112129,"One of Hammer's finer productions of the 1970s, DR JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE offers a refreshing slant on the oft-told Robert Louis Stevenson tale.  With direction from Roy Ward Baker (THE VAMPIRE LOVERS) and a sweeping lush musical score by David Whitaker, this is an enjoyable ride.

Ambitious and naive Doctor Jekyll (Ralph Bates) sets out to create vaccines for dangerous diseases but instead stumbles across  a serum taken from the glands of young females.  Using himself as a human guinea pig, he takes the potion and is transformed into a female version of himself.  Using the alias of Mrs Hyde (Martine Beswick), his widowed sister, he sets out to harvest the glands of young female victims.  With the body-count rising and Jekyll/Hyde's life spiralling out of control, madness is only around the corner...  Adding complications is Jekyll's young female neighbour Susan (Susan Broderick) who develops a crush on him, while her brother Howard (Lewis Fiander) becomes infatuated with the elusive Mrs Hyde.

Ralph Bates and Martine Beswick handle the complicated title roles well, and really do look like each other.  The transformation sequences are handled with great skill and the final scene (where the two continually morph) is amazing.  Susan Broderick and Lewis Fiander make the most out of thankless, one-dimensional roles.  Art director Robert Jones recreates the gaslight setting of the story with great success.

560993,5,6303112129,DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE IS ON ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES OF THE HAMMER FILM COLLECTION.  A REAL GENDER BENDER. FIRST HAND OF LOOKING AT THE FIGHT OF SEXES.

560994,5,6303112129,"Give this one a chance, for very few movies (horror genre or otherwise) have been built upon an uncanny resemblance between two stars, one male, one female, and DR JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE has a sort of gritty vitality that lifts it out of the ordinary Hammer league.  Partly this is to the credit of Roy Ward Baker, but mostly it is due to the inspired playing of Ralph Bates and his female counterpart Martine Beswicke, each of them looking glorious and evil in what has become the signature role in both careers.  Bates must have been an awfully small man; Martine B towers over him like King Kong over Fay Wray--not that you see them both in the same shot, but you can measure them visually because both use the same sets and in a lot of cases, Ralph Bates barely comes up to the doorknob of the Edinburgh laboratory where Jekyll does his foul work.

Beswicke's dark eyes and pouting, petulant lips will remind 21st century fanboys of Angelina Jolie, maybe a little slighter, but even scarier in the part of Sister Hyde.  It's a little kinky I suppose that she's ""really"" a man, but Ralph Bates never really gets himself in any sex situations he can't extricate himself from.  I guess that would have been too much even for the decadent 70s phase of Hammer films in which nudity and Lesbianism became de rigueur (Bates had just come off LUST FOR A VAMPIRE when assigned this film).

Listening to Ward Baker, Brian Clemens and Martine on the commentary track makes you realize how much was lost first by Ralph Bates' curtailed career, then by his death.  He really was a marvellous actor, even if he was short (he was able to project on screen so that audiences read him as tall and commanding).",1112572800,9,1696,4.522875816993464
560995,4,6303112129,"I knew there'd been quite a few versions and variations on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, both in film and on television, but I never realized how many until I did a little research.  There are at least thirty listed on the internet movie database, many of which I hadn't even heard of, much less seen.  Of the one's I'm familiar with, the versions with John Barrymore (1920), the Fredrich March (1931) and Spencer Tracy (1941), all three stick fairly close to the original source material.  In Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971), the story is carried one step further, which should be evident from the title (I will say I wasn't really surprised to learn this film came out at the time it did, as the late 60's/early 70's brought with it a time of challenging social mores and just generally sticking it to the establishment...this ain't your father's Jeykll and Hyde).

Directed by Roy Ward Baker, who did films for both Hammer Studios (Quatermass and the Pit, Scars of Dracula) and its' rival Amicus (Asylum, The Vault of Horror), the film stars Ralph Bates (Taste the Blood of Dracula, Lust for a Vampire), along with three time Bond girl Martine Beswick (Dr. No - actually, her part in this one was pretty minimal, but I'll still count it, From Russia with Love, and Thunderball).  Also appearing is Gerald Sim (The Man Who Haunted Himself), Lewis Fiander (Dr. Phibes Rises Again, and Susan Broderick, who really has few credits, this film being her most notable role.

As the film begins, Dr. Jekyll (Bates) is working on a universal panacea, or, one serum to cure many different diseases (the film appears to be set in sometime in the early 19th century, so there was plenty of work to do in this area).  His friend and colleague, and also a very naughty womanizer (guess where this leads to), Professor Robertson (Sim) worries that Jekyll is working too hard, and points out that Jekyll will probably never complete his experiment as the time required to develop a cure for each disease, much less combining them into one cure-all serum, would take longer than one man's life span.  Jekyll concedes to this truth, and decides to instead develop a formula that will extend a person's life, the key being female hormones (the thinking is women tend not to age as poorly as men, what with their ability to keep their hair and suppleness of skin).  His results seem promising, but, as we all know, the proof is in the pudding, so Jekyll tries the serum on himself, and presto chango (literally) he turns into a woman, whom he explains away to his nosy neighbors as his widowed sister, Mrs. Hyde (Beswick).  The problems arise in that in order to produce the serum, Jekyll needs certain hormone producing organs, located within women, and the local coroner (who's a real freak, I might add), can no longer fill Jekyll's needs, so Jekyll resorts to dismembering live women, mainly prostitutes (sometimes you have to do bad to do good), but the local authorities, not caring for all the dead bodies piling up, are hot to find this serial killer, so Jekyll uses his alter ego, Sister Hyde, to perform the grisly task.  Only problem now is Sister Hyde is beginning to exert her will, vying for dominance over Dr. Jekyll as to who will ultimately control the one body shared by two, separate personalities.  So, who will win? (I'm rooting for Sister Hyde, as she's pretty hot...)

I had some trepidation about this film, as the advertising (mainly that for the U.S.) focused on the kinkier bits, but that was just one, small aspect of the movie as a whole.  I really enjoyed this movie, one that many consider to be one of the last, great Hammer Studios outings before they, along with the entire British film industry went down the tubes.  Ralph Bates is really good as Jekyll, presenting a man torn between not only if his criminal actions justifying the means, but also struggling against a seemingly superior will in that of Sister Hyde.  Bates was being groomed by Hammer to be one of their next new, young stars, as their most notable stars, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were aging and commanded hefty fees now that their popularity was established.  Bates might have assumed the mantle, had not the industry took a nosedive.  Beswick is also very good, playing Jeykll's very sexy, evil female alter ego.  The casting here was pretty inspired, along with the make up, as Bates and Beswick actually do share similarities, so the notion that they were one in the same was highly believable.  Baker's direction works very well, evoking the style of the old, Universal horror films, while maintaining a contemporary attitude.  I did enjoy the inter-cutting of like scenes, for example in the beginning when Jeykll is butchering a woman and we also see a butcher trimming a rabbit.  The violence is mainly off screen, but there is a good amount of blood.  I thought it kind of odd as the film had a particularly high body count and given the relatively small area where most all of the murders occurred, it served only to highlight the ineptness of the local authorities.  The sets felt authentic, adding much to the film, but I think they were used in previous Hammer films as I could swear I recognized a few of them, specifically Jeykll's laboratory, from another film.

The widescreen print by Anchor Bay looks good, although, as another reviewer has already stated, the aspect ratio is such that a small part of the picture gets cropped out.  Special features include a commentary track by star Martine Beswick, director Roy Ward Baker, and writer/co-producer Brian Clemens, moderated by historian Marcus Hearn, along with a theatrical trailer, radio spots, poster and still galleries, as well as some detailed talent bios.

560996,4,6303112129,"If you're a horror fan over the age of 35, you probably remember some of the old horror flicks from Hammer Studios.  Some of them were creepy, some of them silly, and some of them downright awful.  But a few of them were really good.  `Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde' is one of the good ones that horror fans should rediscover.
Dr. Jekyll (Ralph Bates) sits in his laboratory, lamenting the fact that man will never live long enough to cure many of the diseases that afflict humanity.  Jekyll discovers that by injecting female hormones into a male fly, he can greatly extend the life of the fly.  He tries the experiment on himself.  Then he notices that the fly is no longer male.  Oops.
Jekyll's alter-ego, whom he explains away as his sister, Ms Hyde (Martine Beswick), quickly becomes responsible for all kinds of mayhem.  The running dilemma in the movie becomes ""Who will win the battle for control of Jekyll's body?  Man or woman?""
I didn't really expect much from `Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde,' but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, the film has plot holes everywhere, but director Roy Ward Baker focuses on the story and keeps it moving well with a few interesting (and humorous) romantic subplots.  Yet the most remarkable element of the film is in its casting.  Bates and Beswick bear an uncanny resemblance to one another, making the film's premise believable and enjoyable.  So sit back, and enjoy a really fun horror film from the imaginative 70's.  And tell yourself that those Hammer films weren't so bad after all.

The inevitable Jekyll-into-Hyde transformation takes place, and he changes into a ravishing female version of himself(movie siren Martine Beswick). Hammer Films' 1971 ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde""s plot unravels slowly as the camera winds down foggy, moon-lit London streets. The edgy pace picks up, however, hustling to a typically thrilling ending. Once promoted as the new, younger Christopher Lee, Ralph Bates has the lead role. Sadly, he died young at age 51 of cancer. The distaff Hyde is played by exotic Martine Beswick, who was lovely as Bond Girls in 2 films.  She danced in ""One Million BC"" for Hammer, and was awarded the lead in it's sequel, ""Prehistoric Women"". Today she runs a furniture moving business in London.

7837670,5,6303112129,"After reading Marcus Hearn & Alan Barnes' THE HAMMER STORY and visiting Chris Woods' cheeky BRITISH HORROR FILMS website (google it, the film reviews are a scream!), I have been working my way through most of Hammer Film's core output especially the often overlooked and unfairly maligned early 1970s films. The first part of this is due to the films being unavailable in America for awhile due to distribution problems while the bad rap comes from unfair criticism from hardcore fans because the company was trying something different. DOCTOR JEKYLL & SISTER HYDE is one of the very best examples of this new approach forging the old style Gothic look with clever scriptwriing that is both reverant and irreverant to the source material. This comes as no surprise since the driving force behind the film is Brian Clemens the man chiefly responsible for THE AVENGERS. In addition to an interesting twist on the Jekyll/Hyde theme, we get Jack the Ripper and Burke & Hare seamlessly added to the mix

The setting is all too familiar. Victorian London with endless fog swirling about the streets. Well to do people in 19th century clothes strolling about while the lower class types are seen milling about the local public houses. Dr Jekyll (Ralph Bates) is seeking an elixir to prolong life and deduces that he needs female hormones to do it. As a result of these hormones, his alter ego becomes a woman and the ""battle of the sexes"" has begun. In order to keep up his supply he/she is forced to murder prostitutes hence Jack the Ripper. Brilliant! Although 50 years before the Ripper, Clemens works Burke & Hare into the story since they are a part of the British ""penny dreadful"" tradition and well known to British horror audiences. Add references from Val Lewton's THE BODY SNATCHER and 1968's OLIVER and you have a movie that is a delight from start to finish.

Adding to the fun are the remarkable performances of Ralph Bates and especially Martine Beswick as Jekyll & Sister Hyde. They really do seem to be an inseparable part of each other. The transformations are well handled and just watch how Martine handles discovering that she now has a female body. The film is bloody not gory and since it was shot entirely on a soundstage, this allows director Roy Ward Baker to have complete control over the look of the film from the quality camerawork to the sublime set lighting. The lush, psuedo-Rachmaninoff score is also a definite plus. It's an example of where everything came together on a film from the settings to the performances to even the cheeky title which is wonderfully lurid (a publicist's dream) and delightfully appropriate. My favorite 1970s Hammer film after HANDS OF THE RIPPER and an absolute must for fans of the Jekyll/Hyde saga and Jack the Ripper.",1378598400,3,2776,4.805439330543933
7837671,5,6303112129,"I honestly don't know where Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde ranks among the affections of Hammer Film philes, but I consider it to be among the best of the Hammer gothics I've had the pleasure to see. The title suggests something lurid, but while DR. JEKYLL & SISTER HYDE is at times titillating, it's more than the title would suggest. Yet it's exactly what the title would suggest. In this reinvention of the Stevenson classic - and Hammer was a master of reinventing classics without gutting the heart of the tale - Dr. Jekyll is seeking the elixir of life, rather than a way of separating the bad from the good in the human heart. The end result of his well-meant but misguided experiment is, however, the same. Or, nearly. Having based his experiments on the hypothesis that estrogen (!) is the key to ever elusive immortality (just SEE how a woman's skin glows with youth and beauty!), Hyde inadvertently not only brings out his darker side when the unexpected side effect of his chemistry kicks in, but it also brings out his feminine side. The subtext is every bit as rich as you might suspect. Of course, subtext is the subtle under-message of an overt story and the story, generally speaking, and the story here is excellent. Hammer masterfully ties in this version of Jekyll with Burke and Haire, as well as Jack the Ripper. It's sharp, creative writing and draws much substance from the tale, using not only the meat of ideas driving Stevenson's classic but also whipping in the alternative history components, making this a rich feast, indeed. To boot, there is the added complication of the fact that as Jekyll battles it out in his head for supremacy with his tenebrous feminine side - and she's as strong-willed and stubborn as she is beautiful - he's falling in love with the young lady upstairs at the same time Ms. Hyde is falling for the young woman's brother! It's one of the finer stories in the Hammer canon, at least among those Hammer films I've seen so far. It's more than a riveting potboiler and captivating melodrama packaged in lush gothic horror. It's out-and-out outstanding (did I out myself?) cinematic storytelling, gripping and suspenseful.

the Ripper movie all in one but it also has the Mad Scientist story line where he is transformed into a woman and both the male and
female are attracted to a brother and sister who live next door. It gets kinda kinky and weird especially when he's kissing men and
then starts to turn back into a man! the first transgender movie? maybe Hollyweird can remake it since they are into this now! but
as far as a Hammer movie it's well made and written and Ralph Bates is good again as he was in Horror of Frankenstein. but the price?",1326067200,,801,4.044025157232705
7837674,3,6303112129,"Hammer spun the wheel and created a Sister Hyde in this early '70s horror flick. The tale is the same
old one with a few twists and a tad of nudity. Jekyll turns into a lady Hyde that begins to dominate
his weak male ego. Has a few laughs, especially when he finds dresses in his closet. Fun.",1292716800,,292,4.051724137931035

Films was no help either. So fans, we will just have to lobby the current holder of the DVD rights to issue a U.S. release. Go for it ASAP!",1264723200,2,366,4.5606060606060606

a longer uncut version of Dr. Jekyl Sister Hyde...it was too short and wasn't as exciting as i once remembered.
 unless there is an uncut-longer version please forward it to me or i guess i just stay unsatisfied.

  thanks anyway,
