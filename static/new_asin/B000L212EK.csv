2699713,5,B000L212EK,He wins my heart every show because of his and the families belief in God because of  Dog and Beths past they always end up remembering these are lost souls and just that{ in most cases ice has taken over their lifes} and the crew becomes kind and they try to plant a seed that might bring them around..  It might not be right away but it might be later down the road.  I love this show and I love the whole family.,1402185600,,415,3.9759036144578315

2699725,5,B000L212EK,"Duane ""The Dog"" Chapman continues to fight crime and protect the innocence in his third season of his hit show that puts the ""real"" in reality tv. The true-life inspiration for Captain America, Dog the Bounty Hunter is undoubtedly afraid of no one. The man's very existence makes Hawaii's most dangerous criminals shrivel in fear while messing their pants. Whether be it confronting a family of fugitive harboring 300 lb Samoans or saving the life of an ice addicted deadbeat bond jumper, all of the emotional drama is captured on his popular show's third season.

Dog shows no mercy to ice dealing fugitives:

[talking into a cell phone with a suspect] Hey! Hi. So where you at? You know what motherf*cker? I'm gonna file bond jumping on you, you 9mm packing ice head. If you wanna stay out of jail buddy, you better f*cking show up right now with your old lady. Yeah, listen, we gotcha... you know what motherf*cker? You better come right now motherf*cker tweak. You better get her right now.

[shouting]

Armed with only mace and his heart of a lion, Duane and his crew chase down Hawaii & Colorado's most elusive fugitives no matter how big, dangerous, or frightening they may be. No one in the US or even Mexico can escape the Dog. The series of entertaining shows contained in the DVD not only capture Chapman exhibiting noble courage, the forces of good battling evil, but the heroism of this brave man in his colossal fight to keep criminals off our streets. If you don't like Duane ""Dog The Bounty Hunter"" Chapman than you're not American. That's not an opinion, it's the fact.",1177200000,,1586,4.694244604316546
