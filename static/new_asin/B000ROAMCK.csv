2871754,5,B000ROAMCK,"Mercy Mission - This is a great movie.  As an ex-pilot, I could identify with the drama unfolding.  I had been looking for this DVD for a long time and was so happy to find it on Amazon.",1233619200,,186,3.8684210526315788
2871755,4,B000ROAMCK,"This DVD duo shares the common framework of AIRPLANES but unlike many of its predecessors it does not merely focus on the traditional disaster ""airport"" prototype.  Mercy Mission is actually based on a true story and as you watch you will become immersed into the real life drama.  Robert Loggia gives a powerful performance and the story focuses on the human spirit and lessons learned rather than technology and special effects.  The other movie on the disc, Nowehere to Land, is more like the traditional disaster movie but the acting of Jack Wagner and the intricate storyline make this one just as equally pleasing to watch. So, make sure that your tray tables are closed and in their upright position and get ready to watch some riveting ""air"" drama movies.",1219449600,2,763,4.8538461538461535
2871756,5,B000ROAMCK,"This DVD is very, very good! Two films about airplane stories and one inspired in real life!
My favourite is ""Mercy Mission"" where Scott Bakula and the veteran Robert Loggia are great! Scott is the pilot of a small airplane lost in the Pacific Ocean who is helped to safely land by a commercial airline senior pilot. It is really touching. Watch it if you have not done it yet. It's marvelous!! The second film is not as wonderful as the first one but is worth seeing, indeed. ""Nowhere to land"" is the story of of a flight from Australia to the USA where a maniac ex-husband of one of the passengers hides a gas bomb inside the plane and cowardly leaves the aircraft before it takes off. The fight of the pilot and co-pilot to take the plane safely to land in LA before the gas spreads all over is what makes us watching this good film up to the very end!",1218412800,,855,4.251533742331288
2871757,5,B000ROAMCK,"I saw this film quite accidentally one evening while channel surfing and became engrossed in the story almost immediately. It is a disarmingly entertaining tale about a pilot who becomes lost over the Pacific Ocean in his small plane and seems certain to die as his plane is running out of fuel. His only hope is a resourceful and determined Air New Zealand commercial pilot who happens onto the unfolding drama, along with his planeload of passengers. The commercial pilot has to convince the Cessna pilot not to give up when everything looks hopeless and, at the same time, convince skeptical passengers that this is an effort worth taking a risk on. Overall, the story is gripping and highly entertaining. The final outcome is very inspiring and the movie as a whole provides a great message about what great and moral leadership is all about. A film you will want to watch with your children over and over.",1217462400,16,910,4.765822784810126
2871758,5,B000ROAMCK,I got this for my husband for Christmas. He had not seen it for a long time. He watched parts on t.v. He likes having his own copy and really enjoyed both movies.,1200873600,,162,3.9393939393939394
2871759,5,B000ROAMCK,"I missed the first part when it was on the PBS channel so I bought it. I really liked the story, real edge of your seat movie. I like the plane crash genre, the second movie on this is good.",1200873600,,190,3.775
2871760,5,B000ROAMCK,"Being a single-engine airplane pilot myself, I first saw this film quite a few years ago and was very impressed at the realism of the story. This was basically due to the fact that I almost got into a situation of final loss in the middle of the jungle in Brasil. After seeing the film I knew it was a true story, and could feel the tightening around the heart that this pilot must have felt. Very good story! very good film! I highly recommend it!",1200355200,10,448,4.22093023255814
2871761,5,B000ROAMCK,"This is a true story of how a pilot ferrying a single engine cropduster across the ocean, was saved by the help of a pilot in a passing airliner.  Finding the location of the lost pilot is a lesson in science.  It's a heartwarming family movie.",1188000000,3,244,4.282608695652174
2871762,5,B000ROAMCK,"I have been awaiting this to come out on dvd for a while now. It stars Robert Loggia and Scott Bakula. Bakula is flying a single engine plane to another destination in the blackness of night over the ocean. He then encounters some problems with his plane and Loggia, who is Captain of a jet liner, offers his help. Won't say how it ends. This is an excellent tv movie that is full of suspense and tension. I highly recommend it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. My 5-star rating is based on the quality of it being a tv movie. You don't find many like this one. Not sure if I have seen ""Nowhere To Land"" so I won't rate that one.
By The Way: These are not Widescreen, they are Full Screen TV movies.",1187654400,13,704,4.1838235294117645
2871763,5,B000ROAMCK,"I really enjoy the movie ""Mercy Mission"" and I'm so glad to see it's finally being released to DVD.",1186790400,,99,4.2631578947368425
2871824,5,B000ROAMCK,Great movie Mercy Mission,1407283200,,25,5.5
2871825,5,B000ROAMCK,"These movies kept me on the edge of my seat, they were gripping. I will definitely watch it again in the future.",1402617600,,112,4.136363636363637
2871826,5,B000ROAMCK,"Mercy mission is one of our all-time Christmas movies!!! Based on a true story, the acting is great and the film was well made. Don't miss this one!",1402531200,,148,4.321428571428571
2871827,4,B000ROAMCK,"I'm happy to finally get ""Mercy Mission"" on DVD!  I saw this movie years ago and bought it on VHS. It's a well-acted movie with Scott Bakula as the pilot of a crop duster trying to deliver it to Hawaii from the US mainland, and Robert Loggia as the airliner captain trying (from the air) to help him. It has some good lines and it seems realistic.  I definitely recommend this good, family movie.  Oh, and the DVD has a bonus!  The movie ""Nowhere to Land"" is on the disc; it's one I haven't seen, so I am in anticipation of watching another suspenseful movie.  Buy this; you won't be disappointed.",1398470400,,597,4.342342342342342
2871828,5,B000ROAMCK,"A True story that had me guessing until the end of the picture.  I'm not making this up, I watched it straight through, that is hope much I was envolved with the story.  Scott Bakula was believeable in the role as the lost pilot.  Robert Loggia was perfectly cast as the veteran pilot who brings him to safety. Both of these films are winners, driven by good writing, acting, and very important, casting the characters with actors who have the talent in capturing the emotions and so on.  I'm stopping here, buy it, you won't regret it and folks
it is time well spent.",1391558400,,568,4.4326923076923075
2871829,5,B000ROAMCK,Mercy Mission is for me a very nice movie. I have seen it more times on TV and wanted have it,1383609600,,93,3.4761904761904763
2871830,3,B000ROAMCK,The first movie on the DVD was a great movie.  However the second movie has a flaw part way through the disc.  The movie hangs up and won't let you go back or forward.  I was unable to watch the second movie all the way through.  Can you replace this DVD??,1383264000,,256,3.9607843137254903
2871831,4,B000ROAMCK,Not quite true to the story some bits added for dramatic effect but not overdone and stil full of suspense.,1377475200,,107,4.4
2871832,5,B000ROAMCK,"I had seen this movie many years ago and was happy to be able to find it on amazon. I liked the fact that the movie is based on  truth.  Mercy Mission is one of my favorite  movies.

I also had seen Nowhere to Land years ago but enjoyed it very much again.  The quality of the DVD's was excellent.",1376956800,,297,3.8833333333333333
2871833,4,B000ROAMCK,Mercy mission is an enteraining movie and nicely done.  The other move is ok but nothing to write home about.,1375142400,,109,4.45
2871846,5,B000ROAMCK,"Saw this movie on TV in England years ago. I've never seen it air in the United States, so I bought the DVD. Since then it has become a staple at our house around Christmas time.",1360108800,,178,3.9722222222222223
2871847,5,B000ROAMCK,"A great 2-pack of movies suitable for all ages, and definitely appealing to the pilot or aviator in the family. Everyone will enjoy each movie, even though they were produced several years ago using older technology that didn't produce the same ""realism"" that today's technology does.

Still, the stories are true, and the re-enactment is captivating. The actors are great for their parts, and the settings appear authentic enough to add to the quality of the drama.

I purchased the 2-pack for the movie ""Mercy Mission"", and was delighted with the included movie ""Nowhere to Land"" as well. My entire family from ages 15 through 53 enjoyed them both. We laughed, and cried, sat at the edge of our seats, and cheered  with joy during the movie ""Mercy Mission"". What a great movie!

I learned to fly many years ago and today fly large jets worldwide. It's easy to detect those parts of the movie that are staged sets and improvised ""props"" to allowing filming the movie on the ground, but they're close enough to the real thing so that it's not distracting to me, and believable enough to others who wouldn't know the difference.

I can't say enough good things about the movie ""Mercy Mission"", and like another reviewer said, ""...very inspiring and the movie as a whole provides a great message about what great and moral leadership is all about.""",1337731200,,1346,4.7844827586206895
2871848,5,B000ROAMCK,"I'm a huge Scott Bakula fan, so Scott was the initial attraction for me. To be honest though , I had no idea whether or not I would enjoy this particular movie -  although after reading other reviewer's comments and knowing that the price I was spending was very reasonable, I figured the chances were pretty good that I would not be disappointed. Needless to say, both actors gave a very convincing and moving performance. Based on a true story, Robert Loggia plays a commercial airline pilot who is flying a passenger loaded plane on an overseas flight. Scott Bakula also plays a pilot, but one who is flying a smaller craft - also overseas - to a buyer. In sum, the smaller craft loses it's way and is lost somewhere in the middle of nowhere, with a tired pilot and a limited amount of fuel. The young pilot manages to contact air traffic control and is then hooked up with the much larger commercial airline. With permission from the passengers the pilot of the larger plane sets out to locate the smaller craft and assist the pilot in finding his way to the airport. There are some tense moments when it seems more and more unlikely that this mission will be a successful one, which should keep viewers glued to the screen. My favorite element of this film however is the relationship that is formed between the two pilots. The older pilot (Robert Loggia) refuses to let the younger pilot (Scott Bakula) give up - even when the situation becomes a dire one as the younger pilot is exhausted and running out of fuel. I won't give away the ending - although most can probably predict - but it is a rewarding one. As T.V. movies go this one is much better than average and it's a very inspiring story that the whole family can enjoy. I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!",1303516800,,1778,4.487654320987654
2871849,5,B000ROAMCK,"Please note that I am only reviewing this DVD for the film MERCY MISSION. I have been wanting this movie on professional DVD for some years now, having relied on a VHS copy for so many years. This has been a Christmas favorite at our home since it was broadcast on NBC. However, don't worry, it doesn't contain cute elves, warm Santas, or bathotic family reunions; it just takes place at Christmas.

Jay Parkins is a young pilot to whom flying takes first place, even to his responsibilities at home and his pregnant wife. After he's fired from a job for deliberately annoying the client, he and a fellow pilot agree to fly two crop dusting planes to Norfolk Island, deep in the Pacific Ocean. The plane his friend is flying malfunctions as they leave Pago Pago, but Jay continues, knowing he will need the fee for ferrying the plane when his son is born. Unfortunately his navigation equipment fouls, leaving him with no idea where he is, alone with the vast Pacific below. A nearby Air New Zealand commercial flight offers to help find him.

If this all sounds tedious, it isn't. Scott Bakula as Parkins and Robert Loggia as senior Air New Zealand pilot Gordon Vette brilliantly carry this tense film, as Vette uses all his aviation wiles to locate Parkins' tiny plane, and both men form an emotional bond via anxious radio calls. Supporting characters such as Vette's cockpit crew, the head stewardess, Parkins' flying partner, and a planeful of New Zealanders returning from holiday all enhance the story and the tension until the gripping conclusion. If you like good character pieces this film is highly recommended; aviation buffs will probably love it, too.",1298851200,,1665,4.7979094076655056
2871850,5,B000ROAMCK,"This movie (Mercy Mission) was recommended with many superlatives that I thought were exaggerations; the movie (on DVD) surpassed all expectations.  Then to see the second movie (Nowhere to Land), I realized that this was truly a bargain!",1288915200,,238,5.2631578947368425
2871851,5,B000ROAMCK,I was only looking for Mercy Mission and got the second one as a bonus. It's worth getting. The pair of them compliment the other. They are adventure and suspense. I would recommend both of them.,1282608000,,195,4.444444444444445
2871852,5,B000ROAMCK,"Mercy Mission is a very good story and produced in high quality performances with the cast. A true story and worth buying for your collection. I enjoyed it all the way through and will watch again soon as it wasn't boreing at any stage as I first thought when I brought the vhs years ago. It is worth the money I paid for it as I,m not local and finding this movie was hard to find. Well worth the effort but that is my opinion",1271289600,,427,4.035294117647059
2871853,4,B000ROAMCK,"two made for tv movies with mercy mission based on a true story and done very well.  scott bakula and robert loggia at their best, mainly loggia is a stand out.  nowhere to land put together nicely with a touch of good suspense with plenty of twist and turns.  a great deal in a two for one dvd.",1249171200,,295,4.051724137931035

In case viewers don't know - if you watch the final scene where the camera pans across the airport window, two of the actual people this happened to are in the scene. Great Christmas movie! TV should show it every year!",1483056000,,370,4.3

8201830,4,B000ROAMCK,"This is a wonderful movie. I am a huge Scott Bakula fan and buy anything I find with him in it. However, I can not understand why this is priced so high on Amazon! I bought it from a movie store for $11.00. There was no way I could pay $95.00 for it, no matter how much I like Scott. Great movie, just wish it had been closed caption..as I have a hearing loss and had trouble with some of the dialogue on the planes (Thus the 4 stars instead of 5)",1454976000,,447,3.869565217391304

Mercy Mission with Scott Bakula & Robert Loggia is based on a very true story, and the Nowhere To Land is a very exciting & fast paced airplane nasty bomb story that keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.

8201835,5,B000ROAMCK,"We ordered this one as a rental and hadn't read any reviews on it; the synopsis sounded like it might be reasonably enjoyable and it seemed to offer some hope that it would be passably entertaining. We had totally underestimated these two movies and discovered they were gems of the genre.

Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed both movies and found them to be excellent entertainment. They are well directed, cast, acted and produced and provided two evenings of first class family entertainment. I highly recommend them.",1414368000,,523,4.943181818181818
