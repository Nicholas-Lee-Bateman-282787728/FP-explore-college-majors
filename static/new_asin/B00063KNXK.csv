8157154,5,B00063KNXK,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS AILEEN SHERON VIDEO FOR OVER 20 YEARS.  I HAVE TRIED OTHER VIDEO WORKOUTS AND FIND THIS THE MOST SUITABLE TOTAL BODY TONER I HAVE COME ACROSS, AND SEE NO NEED TO CHANGE.  MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE ON DVD SO THAT I CAN USE IT EVERYWHERE I GO!  I HAVE EVEN E-MAILED MS. SHERON EXPRESSING MY INTEREST IN AND THANKFULNESS FOR THE VIDEO.  SHE DID GRACIOUSLY RESPOND BUT I AM STILL ON A MISSION TO GET A DVD.  THE PREVIOUS PRODUCERS ARE OUT-OF- BUSINESS.  THANK YOU FOR THESE REVIEW OPPORTUNITIES. AHHH, THE PLOT THICKENS.  I RECENTLY PURCHASED ANOTHER VHS TAPE AND GOT A FURTHER SURPRISE.  IT IS THE FIRST COPY I HAVE SEEN WHERE THE LADY ON THE COVER IS NAMED JEAN, I BELIEVE THE SIGNATURE IS.  MY ORIGINAL SURPRISE WAS SEEING THAT THE LEOTARDED LADY IS NOT FEATURED IN THE VIDEO BUT A.S. AND KIMBERLY SPIESS WHO ARE DEPICTED ON THE BACK ARE THE ACTUAL DEMONSTRATORS. ANDDD IN REVIEWING E-MAIL FROM A.S IT APPEARS ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST.  IT APPEARS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THIS VERY DESIRERABLE WORKOUT!",1421193600,2,1048,4.411458333333333

8157156,5,B00063KNXK,"I accidentally taped over my favorite workout video ""29 Minute Total Body Toner by Aileen Sheron"". It was old- like 1980s. I couldn't imagine where I would ever find another one. Then I remembered to look on Amazon. I found it for $1.00!!!! It works great even though it's slightly used. I received it within 10 days with regular shipping. Thank you!!!",1289779200,,352,4.693548387096774
