7799561,5,1589975278,"This is one of my favorite presentations of American History and I would recommend these to anyone. The episodes are fast paced and packed with information. In spite of the fact that each episode is only half an hour long, DTH manages to fairly present the important issues and visit some of our most Hallowed ground. I was surprised at the amount of history that was presented that I didn't know about and I have a fairly good knowledge of American history, especially Colonial history.",1363910400,,487,4.741176470588235
7799562,5,1589975278,"""Patriots, Penn, And The Freedom Trail"" is a very entertaining and informative DVD from the Drive Thru History series.

This particular DVD covers three main areas:

1.  Patriots- Paul Revere, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, George Washington, and a host of other patriots who played an imporant role in the founding of our nation's history.
2.  Penn - sites and people associated with William Penn and Philadelphia (Christ Church, Independence Hall, Betsy Ross, etc.).
3.  The Freedom Trail - sites associated with Boston's Freedom Trail (Boston Massacre, Battle of Bunker Hill, churches, cemeteries, USS Consitution, etc.).

The DVD last around 1.5 hours and is well worth the investment of time.  You will learn much about the history of the three areas listed above and enjoy the periodic comedy of narrator Dave Stotts.  He is able to have fun, be funny, and yet have reverance for the sacrifices our forefathers paid to found America.

A very good DVD and I will watch the other ones our church library has.

Recommended.",1305676800,2,1035,5.035294117647059
