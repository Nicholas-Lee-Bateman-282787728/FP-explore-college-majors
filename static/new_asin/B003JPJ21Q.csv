It is not one of those silly ""dance along"" DVD's but real movement skills that are taught from Kindergarten to fifth grade.  Kids get an excellent cardio workout and can do the DVD in a small area.  I have taught P.E. for 23 years and I believe this is the best movement DVD I have seen.  I use parts of it as a warm-up with my students at school and also do it with my own children at home.  Kids at home can get a fun and relevant workout anytime at home.  My kids love it when my wife and I do the workout with them.  The movement skills are simple and easy to master, yet the workout is physically challenging and fun.  This DVD is a great addition to any classroom, at school or home.",1272844800,,821,4.113207547169812

8398399,3,B003JPJ21Q,This is some of the typical exercises everyone learns in gym class at school. It is not very comprehensive. They are moderately good at jump rope. The rest is not all that impressive.,1363824000,,183,4.575757575757576

8398401,5,B003JPJ21Q,"This is video is exactly what I was looking for!  We all get a great workout and learn basic skills, right in our own home.  Our kids just love doing it!  We purchased cones to help with organization and we all get a work out in our living room.  We are sweating when we are done!  I highly recommend this for anyone, especially for your homeschool.",1318550400,,349,4.2272727272727275
8398402,5,B003JPJ21Q,"This is a great video for kids! The kids are real, not actors. It is not a big production video. It uses the same type of people you will see in your kids school. The instructor is a school PE coach and knows how to work with kids. I use it with my kids and they like it because it is on their level. It is physical enough for me to workout them an get a great workout too. It doesn't require a lot of space either. You should definately try it.",1292457600,,445,3.847826086956522
8398403,5,B003JPJ21Q,"This is great! Mr. Bunn and his students demonstrate a full spectrum physical education program. The perfect solution for anyone, not just home schoolers, who want a complete, no nonsense approach to a physical education program. What is really a great component of this program, is that all the exercises can be done in a limited amount of space, if necessary. The children being instructed by Mr. Bunn are ""real"" and we can relate to them. Thank you Mr. Bunn for making this available to us and thank you to all of your students who so effectively demonstrate all the activities for us.",1288569600,2,588,4.718446601941747
8398404,4,B003JPJ21Q,"This is a great way to get the kids moving with some basic strength and agility moves that doesn't require fancy equipment.  If you are a parent who homeschools (or even if you don't) this provides an opportunity for physical education with instruction and structure so that the kids can listen to someone other than you.  It goes through basic stretching, active movements, and cool down in approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  I think it's a worthwhile program and it allows me to incorporate P. E. into my regular curriculum.",1281312000,5,524,4.8
8398405,4,B003JPJ21Q,"We enjoyed this video.  It is a well balanced workout perfect for elementary through junior high age children. Easy to follow instructions got the kids up and moving. The video seemed to have a few spots where the speed of the film sped up or slowed down which was a little distracting, but overall we enjoyed it, and will be implementing it into our home classroom!
Thanks!",1278892800,,374,4.582089552238806
