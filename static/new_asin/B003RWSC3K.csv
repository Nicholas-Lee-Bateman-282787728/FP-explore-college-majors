4187451,5,B003RWSC3K,"I bet all of those people crying about not getting a Glee: Season 1, Vol. 2 are feeling better, but they shouldn't have been so impatient. All of their 1 star votes were for nothing, and they might have actually turned some people off to Glee since its rating dropped. Too bad, some of them are now complaining about not getting the extras that are coming out with the Complete Season. Some people are never happy.",1276819200,6,414,4.4605263157894735
4187452,5,B003RWSC3K,"""Glee"" was a risky proposition when it debuted:  the musical format had never really worked before on TV (""Fame"" the arguable exception), despite many, many attempts (indeed, the musical genre as a whole has declined somewhat outside of theatre, though the 2000s saw a resurgence on film).  But it did work here, and the show's original thirteen-episode commitment (collected in ""Glee: Season One, Vol. 1 - Road to Sectionals"") was extended to a full 22-episode season.  These nine episodes debuted some months after the original run, and at least a few viewers mistook them for a formal second season, but that's not technically true.  We're still in sophmore year at William McKinley High School.  Spoilers follow.

The first volume ended with the kids' triumph at Sectionals against the odds, giving the club some breathing room, but, as they find out in episode 14, not a whole lot.  And, contrary to what less-popular students like Rachel (Lea Michele) had expected and hoped for, winning at Sectionals hasn't resulted in any dramatic improvement in their social standing back at school, which is as cartoonishly hostile as ever.  The ensuing nine episodes cover the period between Sectionals and the Regionals contest, as our main characters grapple with a wide variety of personal issues, and, of course, sing a lot.  The season includes a notable innovation for the show, the single-artist-themed episode:  ""The Power of Madonna"", focussing on the works of, well, Madonna (episode 20 is often called the ""Lady Gaga"" episode, but they only do two songs of hers there; they did as many by KISS in the same episode).  This is one of my personal favourites.  There are also a number of significant guest appearances:  Kristen Chenoweth returns to reprise her role from the first 13, and she is joined (though never onscreen) by ""Wicked"" costar Idina Menzel, Lea Michele's former Broadway costar Jonathan Groff, and internet fan favourite Neil Patrick Harris (""How I Met Your Mother"").

As far as the characters go, the Back 9 are a bit of a mixed bag in terms of screentime relative to the Front 13.  Lea Michele and Cory Monteith (Finn) remain the leads, though they interact with each other a lot less for most of the way through; both continue to turn in excellent performances, and Monteith, the weakest singer in the group at the start, has improved quite a lot (he delivers a terrific rendition of the Rick Springfield standard ""Jessie's Girl"").  Of the rest of the main cast, Chris Colfer (Kurt) and Amber Riley (Mercedes) receive notable boosts in their screentime; Colfer is one of the breakout actors, and he has a couple of strong showcases here, many of them involving his equally impressive father, played by Mike O'Malley (who really should get a Guest Actor Emmy nomination).  Riley was possibly the weakest actor on the show at the start (though one of the best singers), but she's likewise improved considerably.  The biggest losers in all this would be Jessalyn Gilsig (who appears for only a few minutes) and poor Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina), who for long stretches is almost invisible, though things improve for her in the final few episodes.  Dianna Agron (Quinn), also has a lot less prominence, given the writers' desire to sideline the whole pregnancy storyline.  By far the biggest winners overall would be Naya Rivera (Santana) and Heather Morris (Brittany), Quinn's former minions and now two of the show's breakout characters; Morris is a brilliant comedienne (if only the promos would stop giving away all her non sequiturs), and Rivera, as the new HBIC at McKinley, has both great skills as a comedic actress and a fantastic singing voice that she gets to use several times here.

Oh, and Jane Lynch continues to be sheer brilliance, but you probably already knew that.

There are any number of plausible arguments for rating this DVD set at 4 stars instead of five:  these nine episodes lack much of a sense of a narrative arc compared to the first thirteen, albeit in that case the narrative arcs were largley provided by plots that the fans didn't like (Quinn's pregnancy, Terri's not-pregnancy).  Things are looser here, and the show can often be a bit messy in terms of continuity with its plots and characters.  And episode 20, ""Theatricality"", in one of the show's more dramatic moments, falls flat on its face trying to make a point worth making about language (I'm increasingly sensing that the writers' idea of Kurt is very different from the Kurt who comes across on the screen a lot of the time).  But, all these flaws accounted for, I simply can't rate it less than 5 stars:  for all its messiness, ""Glee"" has an energy and life beyond any other show on TV right now, and, even when it immensely frustrates me, I still find it compulsively watchable.  Tremendous acting on the part of the whole cast deliver characters that I really care about.  And the finale is really spectacularly handled.

Luckily it wasn't the DVD's themselves, but it was the flap that held the 2nd DVD. And I noticed that the pivot part of it was broken so there was broken pieces of plastic floating around. Also the plastic wrap on the outside was ripped in half and the case was busted on the bottom part where the case clips together, so it won't properly close.

 Hooked from episode one based on their rendition of Journey's ""don't stop believing."" Their version was just as intense as Journey's original version. The characters all added something to high school as I remembered in 1987-1991.
 Except there is more tolerance in this show than I ever remembered in my 4 years of high school. The writers put a  lot of thought into serious matter such as gay student being harassed by jocks, down syndrome girl being accepted into cheerleading, popular cheerleader ends up with baby etc....

4187480,5,B003RWSC3K,"If you are reading this review, you, my friend, are a Gleek.  Not only are you considering purchasing the series on DVD, clearly you couldn't wait and purchase the entire season at once.  Believe me, I understand.  Anyway, as we are all Gleeks here, I don't need to tell you all the reasons why this show is great, but if you're anything like me, you might want a little more info on the DVD extras.

The good news is that if you purchase season one in two volumes, you'll get all the same extras as the Complete Season 1 DVDs.  Here's a detailed breakdown on the extras included with Season 1, Volume 2:

Glee Music Jukebox:  This is a feature that allows you to skip directly to all the musical numbers on each DVD.  You can let them play in order or just play them on shuffle.  It's a nice feature missing from the Season 1, Volume 1 DVDs.

Glee Sing Along Karaoke:  (10:20) Here you have four songs from the series that can be played either with full vocals or only back-up vocals.  Lyrics play on the screen karaoke-style.  The four numbers are ""Alone"" (1:36), ""Somebody to Love"" (2:51), ""Keep Holding On"" (2:32), and ""Don't Stop Believin'"" (3:22).

Staying in Step with Glee:  (6:20) Here, choreographer Zach Woodlee and assistant choreographer Brook Lipton, along with four of the Vocal Adrenaline dancers, teach the choreography for the Amy Winehouse ""Rehab"" number step by step.

Bite Their Style: Dress Like Your Favorite Gleek:  (8:52) Costume designer Lou Eyrich discusses the personal styles of Rachel, Kurt, Mercedes, and Quinn.

Unleashing the Power of Madonna:  (10:37) Cast and producers are joined by music supervisor P.J. Bloom and music producer Adam Anders in discussion the Madonna episode, what was involved in the production, and what her music means to them.

Making of a Showstopper:  (17:22) Cast, producers, and all the crew listed in the extras above discuss the making of the Vocal Adrenaline's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" number for Regionals.  (This extra was both interesting and entertaining, but the final six  minutes is filled with the footage from the Season 1 finale.  I was hoping it would be uncut footage of the complete performance, but it contains the same cut aways to the hospital.)

Overall, they aren't the most exciting extras, and I hope that future seasons include some substantive commentaries and other features aimed at least in part towards an adult audience.  That said, Glee will never earn less than five stars from me!",1286755200,6,2469,4.832935560859188

I order from Amazon at least every other month- they have gotten a lot of my money over the years.  I still feel ripped off that if I order the vol. 2 DVD then I will have paid $42.50 for season one.  I always learn from my mistakes.  Never again will I order a volume one of a TV season- from now on I will always wait until the full season has been released.  As I said, I feel like I have been taken advantage of.  I live overseas and I do not have access to regular network TV.  I was so eager to order the vol. 1 because I was so excited to start watching ""Glee.""

I've gotta say, while I enjoyed the first thirteen episodes (covered in ""Road to Sectionals""), the last nine episodes (covered in ""Road to Regionals"") were a lot better!

*SPOILER ALERT* Do not read if you have not watched all of the episodes on this DVD!

To start off with, there were some AMAZING guest stars. Guests include: Olivia Newton-John and Josh Groban playing exaggerations of themselves; Neil Patrick Harris playing Bryan Ryan, Will's old high school rival; Idina Menzel as Shelby Corcoran, coach of Vocal Adrenaline, and Rachel's mother. However, my favorite guest of the season would have to be Recurring Guest Star: Jonathan Groff as Jesse St. James, the leading male vocalist in Vocal Adrenaline, who saduces Rachel in the first episode of this set ""Hell-O"", only to break her heart seven episodes later in the opening moments of ""Funk"". Groff was amazing in this set! That boy can sing and move!

All together, I loved ""Road to Regionals""! I can't wait until Season 2 starts on TV so that I can see what happens next!",1284508800,,1150,4.8274111675126905

I could watch the episodes over a few times, but the musical numbers I could watch endlessly.  I never buy DVDs of television shows, but the ""Glee Music Juke Box"" feature sold me on it.  The last three discs (Road to Regionals) have this incredible feature, but the first four (Road to Sectionals) don't.  You would think they would at least chapter index the musical numbers like they do on regular movie musical DVDs.  The musical numbers are very hard to locate.  I still  think it's worth it, but hope they continue with the ""Glee Music Juke Box"" feature in the future. ""Glee"" has been a long awaited treat for someone like me who loves musicals and pop music.  I would easily give 5 stars for the show, but I am subtracting 1 star for the DVD collection for not upgrading the first four discs with the mentioned feature.",1284508800,5,944,4.441860465116279
