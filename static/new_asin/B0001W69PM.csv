8016759,4,B0001W69PM,"This tape contains two features - Iron Man and Spiderman.  While this tape was released in 1985, the content was produced in 1966 and 1968.  You will either love or hate it.  I have seen it some many times since buying it in the early 90s - the high pitched theme song is ""the"" Iron Man song for me.  Quality is reasonable considering it is very low quality animation to start with.  If you are a die hard IronMan fan you will want this tape.

-1 star for having only 1/2 the tape for IronMan.",1345766400,,493,4.136842105263158
