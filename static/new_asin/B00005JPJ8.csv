1587157,5,B00005JPJ8,"All my life I have secretly known what THE SECRET exposes to the world in this fabulous DVD.

A girlfriend gave it to me and said ""You've got to watch this!"" I put it off for a few days and then when I did put it in the DVD player, I was mesmerized by the message.

Two of my pre-teen granddaughters were visiting from out of town. One of them crawled into bed with me while I was watching THE SECRET (second viewing). She said I kept nodding my head and saying, ""uh huh, yep"". When she brought my comments to my attention, I told her, ""This is the TRUTH, Brooke"". Finally, someone has put it out here for the world to become aware of.

Bob Proctor's message in the 'Special Section' really moved me. It was very personal to me as is Esther's comment, ""You ARE that which you call God"". I wonder how many people realize GOD is being us (life)? We have never been separated from God and when one realizes this fact, everything in the SECRET makes more sense.

This is not a psychological brain-washing, self-motivating, wishful, mind manipulating, positive-thinking exploration. The Christian religion teaches God is 'out there' somewhere and that we have to earn God's favor. Yet Jesus teaches the Father is within and we can do all things and MORE. This DVD expresses that fact. The principle of attraction is that we draw unto us what we hold in our consciousness, be it positive or negative. And people wonder why a rain cloud follows them?

The SECRET shows people how to get rid of that 'rain cloud' and to start drawing infinite positive things to them.

Major participants of this DVD were featured on Larry King Live on November 2. The enthusiam in each and every one of the people who practice these principles taught in THE SECRET was so real it bubbled over into the living room from the smiles on their faces, the excitement in their voices and the twinkle in their eyes.

The SECRET should be in every household. Toward the end of the DVD, it's mentioned how much better it would have been to have known the PRINCIPLE (Law of Attraction) from infancy. NOW is the time to put it in the hands of all young parents that they may teach their children what LIFE is all about!

A BIG THANK YOU to the producers for not only an excellent message but for an excellent (very professional) video production!

1587158,5,B00005JPJ8,"Along with ""Disappearance of the Universe"" - ""Ask and it shall be Given"" is a worthy read. Next book - ""The Laws of Attraction""!",1162771200,8,128,4.375
1587159,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is a good video and worth seeing by everyone, but when I say everyone I mean almost everyone because some of us already know this and are only happy to find these ideas finding a more accessable channel to the masses.

I don't mean to sound like I'm talking down to anyone because I am not intentionally, it's just that it has felt for sooooo long that the majority of humanity didn't care about truth or bettering oneself, not only to find happiness with oneself but to make life and the world a better place to exist.

So by all means get this video, change the way you think, your perspective, your life and the world but if you want to know where these ideas came from, that is who brought them to the awaremness of the few in his struggled to bring them to the many, then you'll want to learn from Robert Anton Wilson what he tried to teach us over the last 30 years and 20+ books in both fiction and nonfiction. (NOTE: Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Wilson are 2 different authors).

Robert Anton Wilson also has a DVD documentary called Maybe Logic I would recommend at very least experienceing in conjunction with this and other videos for the seeker of enlightenment.

If you don't believe me here is some of what other's have said of Robert Anton Wilson -

""I have learned more from Bob than from any other source."" -- George Carlin

""Wilson managed to reverse every mental polarity in me, as if I had been pulled through infinity. I was astonished and delighted."" -- Philip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner

""Erudite, witty and genuinely scary "" -- Publishers Weekly

""Robert Anton Wilson is one of the leading thinkers of the modern age."" --Barbara Marx Hubbard, Committee for the Future

""Dazzling the most thrilling tilt-a-whirls and daring loop-o-planes on the midway of higher consciousness."" -- Tom Robbins

""What great physicist hides behind the mask of Wilson?"" -- New Scientist

""The man's either a genius or Jesus."" -- Sounds (London)

""We've needed this for a long time "" -- Henry Miller, author of Tropic of Cancer

""Robert Anton Wilson speaks for that tiny but indispensable minority who are changing the way we think. To read him is to learn what the future holds, how to be part of the future and how to help create the future."" --Robert Shea

""A 21st Century Renaissance Man, the Lenny Bruce of philosophers, funny, optimistic and wise.""
-- The Denver Post

""A super-genius. He has written everything I was afraid to write.""
-- Dr. John Lilly",1162512000,25,2473,4.601366742596811

1587163,5,B00005JPJ8,"After watching this movie and hearing how people had put the ""Law of Attraction"" to work for themselves, I couldn't wait to start creating a new, better reality for myself. The stories are much more than anecdotal evidence that this positive thinking stuff really works...they're inspirational. They make you want to run out of your house or apartment and start living...really living!

In this original (and out-of-print) version of the film, Esther Hicks appears and channels the group of nonphysical teachers that call themselves ""Abraham."" Esther's ""Abraham"" picks up where Edgar Cayce, Jane Roberts, and the rest of the great channels of recorded history had left off. Abraham offers practical processes, and they are truly interested in the ""nitty-gritty"" of what we humans are living. Their goal: To help us help ourselves. That is, the triumphs and tragedies of what we are living will result in the expansion of this world and the next, but will we allow into our experience the results of what we've lived and the desires that we have given birth to? That is the question. Abraham and the other teachers in this film offer their time-tested answers. It's incredibly thought-provoking, and you will want to watch it over and over again.",1161907200,56,1245,5.043689320388349

1587847,1,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret is trash and its 4.5 star rating is a testament to the power of telling people what they want to hear. The best lies are always built around a grain of truth and this is exactly how The Secret is constructed. The grand lie is this: that you can attract the things you want just by meditating on them and visualizing them.

The grain of truth is that something like this can be a powerful component of success and achievement, but it is THE truth like a stick of butter IS a batch of chocolate chip cookies - it is a component of a recipe, but not THE recipe by any stretch of the imagination and in fact the recipe can be made with or without butter.

The Secret would have you believe that you could sit under a tree in the lotus position, close your eyes, and repeat ""I get checks in the mail"" and you will attract checks in your mailbox. Maybe that works for welfare checks, but in real life you might want to add in some hard work with copious amounts of sacrifice/trial/error/fail/learn/rinse/repeat if achievement is the real goal. You can can watch some great athletes going through visualizations before a big game and I don't doubt that this is helpful to them, but nobody has worked harder and sacrificed more to get to where they are then these people. The Secret glosses over anything that involves hard work and grit and makes it all about turning your brain into a magnet to attract health, wealth, and success.

Don't get me wrong, there are some grains of wisdom in here. Practicing gratitude is helpful and even transformative. Ridding your mind of destructive thought patterns and adding in some positive ones is important to personal growth and achievement, but it's not nearly the whole cookie. The Secret is a stick of butter. Chew on that.",1520640000,3,1772,4.53125

1588128,3,B00005JPJ8,"I have mixed emotions about The Secret which is why I rated it at 3 stars. The overall theme is of course positive and could be simply summed up as: Maintain a Positive Attitude. The speakers/proponents of The Secret are well spoken but I notice that many of them are authors/writers who are no doubt making a nice living through the self-help industry.

My problem with their approach is the notion that there is some mystical energy aka God (their words not mine) available to serve up your ever wish when in fact what is actually happening is the impact/power of positive thinking. This is not rocket science yet they are correct in that any of us can get caught up in negative aspects of our lives.

A general example is a person who smiles, is friendly and helpful will likely have more positive things happen in their life compared to someone who is melancholy and self-centered yet a significant aspect of the The Secret ideology is focus on self. Now self focus is absolutely essential but this documentary suggests that by completely focusing on yourself with positive energy will yield oneness with the universe making a menu of your every wish available to you. They even use the imagery of  Aladdin and the Lamp only instead of your being limited to 3 wishes, you have unlimited wishes. Hey, I get the analogy but I feel the approach is overly simplistic and belies the fact that talent, dedication and hard work are required to achieve the life styles of the people portrayed in the video.

A specific and rather silly example in the video is a scenario of a little boy wanting a new bicycle. They illustrate the boy cutting out a picture of the bicycle and creating an image in his mind of already having the bicycle and magically he opens the door and there is a relative (probably a grandfather) who gives him the bicycle probably for his birthday. Translation: if you you are a child let your relatives know what you want for your birthday, you will often get what you want. :)

Don't get me wrong. There is some good, positive, potentially life changing  information shared in The Secret that could benefit anyone but I feel it is shared too much as a mystical Utopia that is not very realistic. You would likely be better off with dedicated study of a skill/field for which you have some level of talent and interest. But absolutely you should radiate a positive attitude/energy about whatever you are pursuing recognizing that the road to success is paved with stumbling blocks that must be overcome to reach your destination.",1518134400,10,2546,4.671875

However, the movie is great as it offers good principles to live by for anyone.  It is true that we become what we think.  Our negative thoughts manifest into reality.  Most impactful is that in order for our positive thoughts to manifest, they must be accompanied with belief, visualization, feeling, gratitude and worthiness.  This is in line with renewal of the mind and fruits of the Spirit as stated in the Word of God.  To fellow Christians, be discerning at all times.

Aside from the convoluted message the presentation style is a sound bite mixture that cannot stay on target or be very consistent. If they could focus on one person and them finish a thought we might have had a chance to see if there was any logic in what they said. Maybe because of time constraints there was no proper background set for the premise.

They lost my interest when one of the presenters said look at your hand it is just energy. Energy has no value in it its self it is what you make of it. I could say you are 97% water. Big deal; that gives no magical value to water.

This presentation preys on the gullible that have lost touch with reality. Instead of explaining how a light switch works they assume the viewer is too stupid and just say use it. In this way them the presenter skirts around reality and five the viewer a false since of empowerment while making a few bucks on the side.

Now if we focus on what is presented and not how or who, there may be some credence. But taking Joseph Campbell ""Follow Your Bliss"" out of context is unforgivable.",1507420800,94,1319,4.39344262295082

Don't let the nattering, nabobs of negativism deter you from the life you really want. Within a month of watching this my life took a whole different path. It's not a Get Rich quick scheme, although you could. For me it was a constant, flowing, change. From blocked paths and closed doors my life is now open doors and easy roads. The path of my life has changed and yours can too. It takes work, but the work is really all between your ears. I watched this DVD every morning for over a month now and Man Alive what a difference in me. Got a great new Job, have streams of opportunity coming my way. Hell even the utility company changed a policy that ended up saving me thousands. Coincidence?  You can believe it if you want to, but I know what my life was and how much the Movie impacted the results I've been getting lately. Do the work and I promise you will see results.

Anyway, on with my review.  I have been using Law of Attraction for awhile now.  I discovered this secret years ago and have continued to use this form of thinking in my personal life.  It has been spot on.  I have created my reality to have many positive experiences, too many to mention here and this doc has explained so much of why law of attraction works and how to make it work for anyone of us.  This video is a great reminder and a great learning tool for people who want to go far or get what they want.  It's also a good reminder to all those who have received (mostly) negative experiences or have received very little of what they have asked for because they can only incorporate the negative into their thoughts.
It isn't for me to judge them, though.  It is there for me to see what I can become if I were to use negativity on a regular basis.
I certainly don't want that kind of reality, so I will continue to enjoy the wealth and prosperity that I create.  We can all learn and take something from this documentary.  I will take the positive thoughts I create and make positive results happen.  This video has gone in depth to remind me of the power of the Law of Attraction.",1499817600,7,1462,4.311355311355311

It shrouds itself in scientific terminology twisted beyond any rational limit to give it a veneer of legitimacy, and then dives right into New Age style spiritualistic claims that lack factual basis and are contrary to what any casual observer will find in the real world outside the Oprah Winfrey bubble. It abuses legitimate psychological techniques (namely self-affirmation and visualization) and dangerously implies that poor people are, in essence, poor because they just don't *want* success bad enough.",1497484800,,728,5.126050420168068

One reason is that Americans are hungering for pragmatic spirituality. Knowledge
They can apply to their own lives.

The second reason is that Americans have grown spiritually and moved to a higher
Plane. In short, Americans on some level know that NOW what they speak and
Visualize will come true.

You can't 'believe' yourself into a graduate degree, a nice house, a desirable job, good health, or a happy marriage.  All of those things take action - specific choices.  Yes, positive goal setting is a part of that process, but it's by far not the only part.  The only way to get what you want is to work hard to get there, and to keep trying when it doesn't come to fruition right away.  Remember, all of the people for whom simply believing in their healing powers didn't work are dead.  So don't put your ideas on paper and tuck them away in a drawer.  Take action to get them.",1484611200,,787,4.423611111111111

1591321,5,B00005JPJ8,"I really love this video. Whether you buy into every detail of the Emerald Tablet and the rest of that history, or just believe that the energy produced by the brain might be able to do something we can't yet understand, the formula still works.

Will you get every little thing your heart desires because you wished it? Probably not. But focusing on what you want, keeping the drive and keeping it positive, taking time to make that focus your priority... those things will certainly help you achieve your goals.

I happen to be fascinated by ancient religious ideas, specifically Alchemy and Paganism at the moment. Both of these traditions use earthly materials to symbolize or help interpret spiritual thoughts or ideas. In many Eastern religions, meditation helps bring enlightenment and earthly peace. Other religions use prayer. Whatever your belief in God or spirituality, The Secret works well within it's walls, with the exception of those more strict interpretations of religions that do not allow for any ideas or teachings not found in their scriptures. The Bible teaches that followers should think on ""whatever is pure, honorable, lovely, and virtuous"", which is the basic premise here as well.

I have certainly found myself happier and more fulfilled over the years as I followed the ideas set forth here. It hasn't been perfect, but just spending time each day to focus on positive things and working to think in positive terms even when saying something negative has been a great improvement. It's not an easy road, and really has taken many years to change my thinking, but my life is almost exactly what I chose. The exceptions were reasoned choices, like I'm not driving the car I want, but it's because I have a strong disagreement with the way that company handled a situation, and chose a different brand.

Does it work? If you think you're happy, you're going to be happier and more focused on what makes you happy, so yeah. Does everyone more out of the projects and into a perfect cabin in the woods on acreage in eight years? No. But if you want something that will inspire you to lead a happier, more fulfilled, and more successful life, I'd give this a go.",1476748800,,2187,4.808510638297872

Rhonda Byrne has also published other works that deserve mention, specifically The Power in audio format only that should be listened to as you would listen to daily affirmations.

If you're a believer and a pioneer of change ...if you understand you are not separate from God but a co creator in your life ....follow this film and the people in it...success awaits you!,1472256000,2,571,4.947916666666667
1591527,5,B00005JPJ8,"After watching this movie and hearing how people had put the ""Law of Attraction"" to work for themselves, I couldn't wait to start creating a new, better reality for myself. The stories are much more than anecdotal evidence that this positive thinking stuff really works...they're inspirational. They make you want to run out of your house or apartment and start living...really living!

In this original (and out-of-print) version of the film, Esther Hicks appears and channels the group of nonphysical teachers that call themselves ""Abraham."" Esther's ""Abraham"" picks up where Edgar Cayce, Jane Roberts, and the rest of the great channels of recorded history had left off. Abraham offers practical processes, and they are truly interested in the ""nitty-gritty"" of what we humans are living. Their goal: To help us help ourselves. That is, the triumphs and tragedies of what we are living will result in the expansion of this world and the next, but will we allow into our experience the results of what we've lived and the desires that we have given birth to? That is the question. Abraham and the other teachers in this film offer their time-tested answers. It's incredibly thought-provoking, and you will want to watch it over and over again.",1471996800,13,1245,5.043689320388349

I tried to sit through the 'whole thing' but felt an anxiety attack bubbling into excruciating-hostility -- so I stopped it before it 'was' too 'late'.

it's not good-it's not bad-it's not in between: between a rock and a hard place; a ramadan forced-exposure: picnic at hanging rock

'The Secret' is big. So big that the word 'big' is too small a word to describe it. You would need a word like, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. But even that wouldn't really be big enough. Maybe if you said it twice, really slowly, while standing at the top of a 20 foot ladder, that might do it, but even then I'm not sure.

This DVD could change your life, but then again so could syphilis. I'm not saying that you'll catch syphilis from watching this DVD, but it's best to wear a condom, just in case. There's a lot of positive thinking in this movie, so don't watch it if you want to be a negative person. (When I say 'a negative person', I don't mean someone who wraps themselves in old camera film. Though that's a lot of fun, it's really hard to find that amount of 35mm film any more. But, if you enjoy that sort of thing, you could try taking off all your clothes and smearing Vaseline over your entire body, 'cause that's a lot of fun too. Especially if you keep your boots on and it squelches between your toes... I'll stop now). Anyway, when I say 'negative' I mean 'Debbie Downer' type of negative. If you like that, don't watch this. But if you are negative and would like to be positive, or even if you're just unsure and would like to be positive, then this DVD will show you how to become positive without sticking your fingers into an electricity socket.

Some of the these principles may work to some degree but through purification of motive or that which serves the greater good for all things.

The one thing which is not highlighted is action. You also need to get into action to achieve what you want, whilst using the power of The Secret. A Ferrari will not fall out of the sky!

1592267,5,B00005JPJ8,"If you don't give this 5 stars you did not get it all! The Secret is all about unshakable faith and belief in your Higher Power ( I say God) and yourself. If you have doubt about it, you have lost the point and it will not be as effective. You can't just think positive or say positive affirmations, you need to go all in and live it. I saw it and did not even look at the 1 to 3 star reviews! What is the point, to read how they think it does not work, that it has been said before, or describe what a shyster is?

I say you forget the medium and listen to the message. What, you thought all those people who are rich, or happy, or both did so because they doubted themselves? Get your head out of your proverbial posterior, stop being so negative and believe in something other than the useless drivel those people who say you cant or said it was impossible say! I will guarantee every successful person applied the principal of the Secret in some form. If you don't truly have the confidence that it will work then in won't. That is why it is called the Secret instead of the Obvious, because we are so bombarded by negativity, critique, and those sad sacks who like to make up excuses because they can't succeed. It is only fear that holds us back. Think about all those successful people, and remember to include those in business, entertainers, and in any form of production and service and you will find quite a lot of people. How many are smarter than you, healthier, more attractive, and more resourceful than you? You will find thousands who have less than you do! If they can do it why not you? There are so many success stories of single mothers, struggling artists, those growing up poor, with less advantages than most, and they are succeeding beyond their dreams. Why? Well, concepts like the Secret tell you why. Problem with the middle class is they are too comfortable to try and they accept just having enough, too worried to lose what they have, when they could gain so much more. If all you can do is complain and put down stuff like the Secret then most likely you will remain where you are.

Now if you still want to write your review, think about this: are you being a critic because you think it is really a bunch of hocus pocus? Or, are you just negative and bitter because you are a have not, who does not have the belief to make it work. If you fall short of a 5 star review, does that
just prove you have doubt? If you want to complain about the writing, the lighting, or the production quality then OK, but really it was pretty well produced. Otherwise feel powerful, believe in your power, and do not let anything negative stop you from success!",1462147200,,2676,4.318091451292246

I didn't grow up with many tools and strategies on how to deal with difficult situations or even how to  deal with life in general.  Kind of blundered my way through with, I hope, the best intentions.  This CD opened my eyes and has driven me to listen to other teachers who espouse the same message but in different ways.  As I listen to different people, I gain more insight and knowledge and, five years later, I understand myself better and realize I am still a work in progress.  Change doesn't happen overnight.  It takes persistence, mindfulness, a willingness to let go of the past, and a real willingness to observe your own behavior without the rose-colored glasses.

It takes what we kind of know and puts it all together in a neat package with encouragement to realize that we are what we think about and that we are the boss of directing or re-directing our thought patterns. My husband and I watch this every so often to keep us focused and have shared it many times over. I practiced this before I ever watched this and I can testify that the principle is sound. I drew up my kitchen and a couple of years later had that kitchen. I drew up our garage and - wouldn't you know it, we now have that garage. I'm no good at drawing cars. I did a lot of research to determine what car I would want to replace my 17 year old Sebring convertible. I ended up deciding and printed out a photo, which hung on my wall for a year or so. We made a totally unplanned, unanticipated trip. The first car we looked at was it. We brought it home and it matches the photo, couldn't be in more perfect shape and we enjoy it much.

1592734,1,B00005JPJ8,"Im about ten years late in investigating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret/dp/1582701709/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret</a>, but I remember the intense interest surrounding its release. The biggest triumph that both the book and its movie version can claim is their marketing campaign, which nearly hooked me at the time. Though I had not officially watched it before now, it turns out that I had unwittingly already acquainted myself with the secretand dismissed it. The Secret is the law of attraction - a component of the New Thought movement and the acceptance of which relies on a lack of skepticism and the inability to spot logical fallacies.

The movie is essentially a documentary with some loosely-dramatized inserts. It makes the point that thoughts and feelings attract experiences through a form of cosmic ordering, and that the universe delivers the products of our thinking. Thereby, the movie claims that we can utilize positive thinking to achieve our goals and acquire virtually anything we please.

The Secret boasts strong production values and is engagingly directed by Drew Heriot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-of-the-Heart/dp/B00O7ZIW5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power of the Heart</a>). It weaves together a fairly consistent narrative through the words of a diverse set of interviewees, from New Thought minister Michael Beckwith to various quantum physicists and even feng shui consultant Marie Diamond. They sound like they know what they're talking about, and the film pushes a message of hope to virtually anybody in need of change in their lives. Disappointingly, its false hope. On a good day, I could wheedle out the kernels of factuality scattered throughout the production, but this is not a good day and I am not feeling generous. This film earns its low rating for three major reasons:

1. It does not support its premise. The Secret is an empty notion, buoyed by the weightless proof of personal testimony and the writers invention that the heroes of history demonstrate their awareness of it thru mined quotations. I won't get even into the claims of energy = god and that all diseases are caused by stress, but the film fails to provide the objective evidence to prove its premise as anything other than magical thinking.
2. It encourages victim-blaming. One of the films anecdotes describes a gay man who endured nonstop homophobic harassment, and then claims that he invited such abuse by focusing on it. By this premise, having negative emotions  even justified ones  is the same as taping a kick me sign to your own back, to which the conscious universe obliges. Thats pretty low of you, movie.
3. Its premise is unfalsifiable. Any law worth considering includes some means by which it could theoretically be proven wrong, and the law of attraction has none. Should The Secret not work for you, you're just doing something wrong.

The movie provides very little time for contemplation: the interviewees bombard you with nonstop babble, with rare moments to reflect on what are meant to be world-changing ideas. I don't blame the filmmakers: since they're pushing people to accept mystical explanations to ordinary circumstances, it needs to lay its nonsense on very thick. It wasn't thick enough for me, though, as I remain unconvinced. Leave it be, folks.",1456617600,,3414,5.456439393939394

1593009,1,B00005JPJ8,"Advertised as Plato and Da Vinci meet the New Age?, The Secret is heavy on the latter and miniscule on the former. In fact Leonardos influence seems to extend no further than the packaging and back screen as an assortment of self-titled visionaries, metaphysicians and philosophers talk about the law of attraction. A clever marketing strategy in the wake of The Da Vinci Code though, somehow, I think its doubtful that a 15th century homosexual Florentine artist with a penchant for esoterica and illegal dissection was concerned with manifesting a new Lotus and annual bonus. As for Plato, one neednt be an expert to know what he would think of a belief (philosophy isn't the word here) that essentially says that you can use mental techniques to bring about as much material success as your greed will let you have. But such is The Secret, a spectacular exercise in marketing at a time of global unhappiness, confusion and fatigue with religion. Indeed, its attracted a fortune for its authoress.

The essential belief is a kind of spiritual homeopathy where thoughts attract like. If you want a new car, a house or a billion in the bank, you simply have to Ask, believe and receive. Its official; spirituality has gone McDonalds and theres an all you can eat offer on, self-control only limits what you can receive. This was inevitable really in a culture as consumer obsessed as our own, it was only a matter of time before customer demand broke through the bounds of matter and the universe would become, in the actual, verbatim words of one person interviewed, a great ordering catalogue. I cant help but wonder what the returns policy is.

Things turn rather sinister when, with half-threatening glares, the speakers start talking about curing terminal illnesses with the help of The Secret. Someone at least had the common sense to leave in a quack advising to continue with conventional medication while acting on these beliefs but the message is resounding; the law of attraction can cure you and if it doesnt then I guess you just don't believe hard enough. Its at this point that the ultra-consumerist, amoral, predatory undercurrents of The Secret are obvious and, my goodness, are they ugly. Of course, theres really no such thing as social deprivation, prejudice and exploitation in The Secrets universe either. On the contrary, the 1% who earn 96% have accumulated their wealth through exercising the secret and now Rhonda Byrne is bringing these very techniques right to your living room. Theres nothing new in any of this, just the same old motivational talks thats been peddled since the 80s only this time its in Renaissance drag.

That a positive disposition will often equal realistic success is an obvious truth, not a deeply held secret that Rosicrucians and Templars died to protect. Still, its a sad fact that people spend a fortune on getting others to tell them things that they already know and this poorly made, 90-minute infomercial is another yet manifestation made available to a greedy market.",1453420800,2,3028,4.933333333333334

1593012,1,B00005JPJ8,"This movie is a sham and a total waste of time.  You will spend 60-90 minutes of your life learning that the ""visionaries"" and other ""experts"" in the movie believe that if  you believe something will happen, it will happen.  That's it.

For example, they said if you're going to the mall and you envision yourself parking in the best spot available... and really believe it... that spot will be available when you arrive.  If you want to make a lot of money, all you have to do is believe you're going to make it.  Figure out exactly how much you want to make, don't worry about how you're going to do it.  You see, according to this video, most people make wealth building too difficult.  You don't need a plan, you don't need anything other than the belief that within an arbitrary time you will come into possession of an arbitrary amount of money.  And only you can figure out the time-frame and the amount.  The only catch is that you really have to believe it ;)  In fact, they suggest that after you decide you believe you're going to be rich, you should start acting as though you already are.

To be fair, I really do believe a positive mindset would do wonders to help people.  I see underachievement as a huge problem in this country and in a lot of cases I believe it is due to frank laziness; however, I believe there are a lot of people who are genuinely afraid to put themselves out there and try.  You only get one shot at life and it would be  a shame to sell yourself short because you were afraid to try.  And when you do try, it is well known that a positive mindset will only serve to enhance success.  So, I suppose in that respect the movie is not totally worthless.  If you need help with positive thinking though, a Tony Robbins book might be a better use of your time.

I had to watch this video one day in class when my constitutional law professor was sick.  Instead of canceling class, he made us watch this.  At first I thought this was some kind of weird joke, but later on I feel like he may have actually believed this.",1453334400,,2052,4.277922077922078

1593197,4,B00005JPJ8,"Very interesting and worth watching more than once. Just be careful not to think it has THEE answer...it's a good tool to use as a jump off point to learning more about our connection with the Greater and our responsibility in creating the life we want, taking the actions we need to take, rather than mere wishful thinking. That can lend to magical thinking. So, stay grounded and read as ONE guide, not an ultimate answer. Just sayin'.",1451001600,,437,4.615384615384615

1593204,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is a great DVD for anyone that wants to learn how they can start to take control of their lives.. This DVD is about the Law of Attraction.

What is the Law of Attraction or (LOA)? The law of attraction is the name given to the maxim ""like attracts like"" which in New Thought philosophy is used to sum up the idea that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts a person brings positive or negative experiences into their life.

I have noticed in my life the above statement is VERY TRUE! When you think negative more negative things happen to you. When your positive you attract good things into your life.

You have to practice it though daily for it to work. I have a vision board and everything. I got free coffee's. Found $5 on the ground. Earned $300 out of no where. Got a free car (Yes a free car!)

You can do it too! I highly recommend this item to friends and family. I'm buying the books next!",1449360000,8,911,4.2485549132947975

This movie was very inspiring for me. I think a lot of us lose track of our dreams as we age.

1594283,4,B00005JPJ8,"Ummm...so to be completely honest this changed my life.  I wouldn't say that I am 100% in with all that they say (I don't think people can look like a body builder by visualizing and believing it without the work).  But I do believe that there are a lot of things we do not fully understand and I have had some very unique events happen in my life ever since being exposed to the Law of Attraction (like winning a huge scratcher lotto ticket off of an intuitive nudge, busted a U-Turn and went to 7-11 to buy one after just seeing that scene from the secret in my head while driving home...no intention of buying one at all prior to that second, or when I wanted a new car and out of the blue a good friend offered me his high end car for about 50% KBB within a week of test driving the same car at a lot).  The main reason I am giving this its 5th star is because at the time in my life I was depressed.  I had made a bunch of money and I wasn't happy with my life.  Long story short my girlfriend made me watch this, which I completely didn't want to, and it changed my life.  I can say I have been much more optimistic ever since then and accomplished a great deal of growth.  Everyone close to me has commented on how much happier I seem.  And to me that's a good life.  So if you practice this stuff and understand that your happiness is not attached to the end result you will get plenty of great end results but more importantly it will help you find happiness.  It is a great starting point in what could be an amazing adventure.  Just keep your feet on the ground and head out of the clouds.",1438819200,6,1600,4.063694267515924

1594412,4,B00005JPJ8,"Finally got through watching this streamed version...after hearing umpteen people talking about and bally-hooing this documentary. I had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. Now it is all explained to me; why do the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? (Or at least, it seems that way...) Because the rich and the poor send out completely different vibrations and are getting back what they are emanating forth. If you are metaphysically minded (yep, that's me) this will not seem like ""hocus pocus"" or gimmicky when you understand fully the concepts. I have and enjoy ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" and The Secret follows a very similar format of narrating. How that young boy managed to get that much-yearned for new bicycle? It sounds easy, but yet it's not. The boy had to be in tune with all the warm-fuzzy feelings associated with owning that bike, before he could be open to signs and signals that told him to keep going...you're on the right path. Now I have to picture success and quit picturing failure, quit talking about ""I'm so sick of, tired of, I wish I didn't have to..."" All those countering thoughts that supposedly broadcast negative vibes, that come back as negative vibes back to me, or you....that represent hardship, debt, stress, etc. That is why we get more of this ""stuff"" that we are fed up with.

Also, I'm going to have to get my hands on some of Lisa Nichol's literature....So wise and warm, as well as the other contributors....

Between the visually stunning imagery, the stirring real-life case examples, and the wise philosophies....I can see myself returning to it I ever need a real mood lifter!",1438128000,,1643,4.7212543554006965

1594597,5,B00005JPJ8,"I have watched this already a while ago, loaned by a friend.  I recently purchased it for myself because it is a powerful reminder that we all have the ability to draw toward us all that we desire from life.  Due to outside influences eg peers, parents, educators etc we often create an alternative belief around their view of the world and what can be gained from it.  Some believe that they are not worthy enough to have what they want, some are tuned into their upbringing being poor and therefore it is 'their lot in life' to continue that path, others think that by wanting a life full of rich rewards from the small effort of less than hard work, it is wrong or against their religion or just plain greedy. However, as the Secret points out, there is enough of everything for everyone and we can beat anything that creates negativity in ours and others lives, by understanding that we are all part of the universal energy of the earth. For me it helped my negative belief of not amounting to anything (words from childhood). I have since proved to myself and others that this is absolutely not so and my life has turned into one that is in line with my dreams and goals.  Obviously I am still on that path and finding new and exciting dimensions all the time.  I have turned from the pointless future I dreaded to one that totally suits me.  Watch this a few times and you will see and understand exactly what the people passing on their wealth of understanding, actually want you to know and believe.  It's a brilliant film.",1436659200,11,1531,4.446428571428571
1594598,5,B00005JPJ8,"I watched this years ago and decided to order it for a friend who was going through a tough time in life (Sudden job loss, low self-esteem, financial stress, experiencing anxiety, etc). I felt like he needed a ""reset button"" in some ways and probably wouldn't read the book, so the DVD was the next best thing to get the point across about the Law of Attraction and how he could use it to change his life.

I gave him this and a personalized/initialed money clip. I wanted to drive home the point that as long as he EXPECTED money and prosperity to come into his life, it would. He appreciated the gift and the reminder about the importance of attracting wealth in all areas of life (personal and professional) into his life.",1436572800,2,725,4.451127819548872

It is not new age nonsense by any means. Your thoughts are powerful!! You create your reality, so if you have hateful and angry thoughts, thoughts full of fear, you WILL manifest what you hate in your life. It is the same for what you love and want. I have removed the negative thoughts from my life, and instead I am focusing on what I love and enjoy and want in life, and my entire perception of reality is pure bliss now.

I've watched the original over 100 times and it's helped me incredibly over the years, and one of the greatest teachers from that version isn't on this one - a total loss... and all over licensing rights and the need for the producer to demand all the licensing rights to the content.

1595027,2,B00005JPJ8,"I think that their argument about the law of attraction is generally correct. I do believe that we attract things into our lives with our thoughts. However, I think that they way overemphasize the thinking aspect of it, and they do not even come close to emphasizing enough the personal effort aspect of it, which is essential in the law of attraction. They say there are 3 steps to the process: Ask, Believe, and Receive. But they are completely missing the step of WORKING for it!!! In the movie they make it seem like if you simply think it, youll get it. Thats false. In addition to thinking about it, you ALSO need to WORK for it. You have to put in the required effort to get what you are thinking about. THEN the law of attraction is actually operational in ones life. You cant just think about something and automatically get it without working for it. Maybe they don't emphasize that hardly at all because when you start to think about something consistently, you will naturally begin to ACT in ways to obtain that thing. Also, I think that they are wrong when they throw out the blanket statement that everything that comes into your life is attracted by your own self. I don't think that is true. I think that a lot of things if not most things that come into your life are attracted to you by your thoughts, but not all things. Did all the people who died in 9/11 attract a plane into their building with their thoughts? No, they absolutely did not. Do little children who get shot and killed in school by a sniper attract that into their lives? No, they do not. So saying that everything that comes into your life is attracted to you by your own thoughts is a lie. I think in the movie they make that blanket statement just to emphasis how much of the things in your life is attracted to you by your own thoughts. I also don't think it is true when they say that the universe will rearrange itself to make it happen for you or to get you what you want. I think what they really mean when they say that is when you think about and focus on and work towards something enough, then you will be able to impact the universe enough to obtain that thing you want. So it is YOU making the change in the universe, not the universe changing itself for you. I don't mean to sound critical, but I also think it is really stupid when they make it sound like all you have to do is envision something and youll get it. Like holding an image of you talking to an old friend. Just because you do that does not mean that person will suddenly phone you or send you a letter. Or the guy who says that he gets open parking spots all the time exactly where he wants them to just by envisioning them. That is a load of crap. If by exactly where I want them to he really means he finds one open spot somewhere on the floor or lot he wants, then that makes more sense, but envisioning an open parking space in the exact spot he wants does not mean it will happen. So overall I think their main message is correct to an extent, and it is a very good message, although it has several flaws to it. Almost as if they are teaching the philosophies of men mingled with truth. You have to separate the truth from the false philosophies that they teach. But overall, I think the idea that you can improve your life by improving your thoughts and focusing on good things is a very good message. For example, when they say that If you want to change your circumstances, you must first change your thinking  that is true and I think that is a very good message that a lot of people need.",1433462400,5,3564,4.256637168141593

I just watched the trailer posted above these comments and the trailer portrays this as a movie called ""The Secret"" starring david duchovney, (I'm sure I misspelled his name), and he plays a man whose wife and daughter get into a car accident and when his daughter awakes from a coma she thinks she is her dad's wife and tries to sleep with him.....

1595219,5,B00005JPJ8,"I was facing a very difficult surgery - a removal of a 29 plus lb mass when a FB friend from Wisconsin recommended I get a copy of this.  I found it on Netflix.  My daughters and I must have watched this at least 5 times prior to my going to hospital for surgery.
As it turned out - the mass contained cancer Stage 1A.  The surgeon told me he almost lost me in surgery and in all his years as surgeon he had never seen anything like the way it instantly turned around.  End result - I am two years out and no need to date for chemo or radiation.
 I will add that I believe many prayers were answered by prayer groups around the world for a good outcome on my surgery.  My attitude towards having the surgery changed. I can't say my outcome was because of this video - however, I can say this.  It is not snake oil.  I think it just reminds you what difference a positive attitude can make in all situations.  It jolts you when it comes to the realization there is a Higher Power.  I am a Bible believer.  I believe that the power within us is truly greater than the  power within the world.  There is no greater teacher of that outside our  Bibles than this video ""The Secret"".  Well worth the watch for sure.  May you all be blessed as I was by the friend that recommended I watch this.",1431734400,2,1287,4.088

1596292,5,B00005JPJ8,"I love this film! I actually listen to it everyday at work. I just have it playing while I am doing my work. The premise is pretty simple: What you think about you attract to yourself. So if you constantly think negative thoughts negative things will happen. Looking back on my life I now see that this is true and wish I would have watched this 15 years ago. I am not saying this from an airheady ""Hey... You always have to be positive and happy"" point of view. I am saying this as a person who does think negatively on a daily basis so I listen to this everyday at work and it actually makes me change the way I am thinking. Even if the Law of Attraction is not true, it can't hurt to be more positive because negative thinking actually has a physical impact on your health. I like the various speakers' tones they use and they really hammer the message home by thoroughly explaining the theory and repeating it in various ways. A major statement in the film that also summarizes their message in three words is... ""Thoughts Become Things"".",1423958400,,1042,4.376288659793815

1596433,5,B00005JPJ8,Great movie,1421712000,,11,5.0
1596434,3,B00005JPJ8,"Watch the film! This is better than the book of the same title. The book is dismissible because it read like wishful thinking gone wrong. The film makes the message of the ""law of attraction"" clearer. I like the film because it was cast in a more positive light.

A major visual blooper in the film:

What has a Templar knight and some holy religious men got to do with hiding ""the secret"" as some scenes seem to infer? ROFLMAO! Whoever created over-dramatic scenes like those don't seem to know anything about the history of religion or the teachings of those religious figures - which is the reason why I'm giving this film a mere pass grade and nothing more.

The film also says that one should ""feel good"" or hold good feelings in the midst of despair so that one could change one's life for the better. Maybe, but that doesn't sound like IGNORING the problem at hand while you chase after ""good feelings""? Sounds very much like that Protestant preacher, Joel Osteen, doesn't it? Want to ""feel good""? Try masturbation!

I suggest that you read Rhonda Byrne's books titled ""The Magic"" and ""The Power"".

This film is a good introductory for those who are or have been feeling like there is ""something else"". But to really crack the glossed over messages in the movie you need to pick a person who you most resonate with and STICK with it! Read the go to books like Think and Grow Rich or Biology of Belief or many others. But you have to go deep bc at first you'll think its silly or say affirmations in a condescending manner...but if you really want change, start with this movie and perhaps the Metta version. Almost all of the old thought teachers say pretty much the same thing just in vastly different ways. I love Les Brown and Lisa Nichols as well as Bashar bc how they teach the Universal Laws clicks with me more so than others.",1420070400,,897,4.345238095238095

1596628,5,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD truly hit home for me because of the presentation. I am very grateful for one thing in particular that I got from this DVD. I totally understand WHY my negative thoughts (hate, revenge, worry, fear, etc.) were killing me. I would let these thoughts go on and on like a run away truck all day long, every day. I dropped these out of my way of thinking (""The Secret"" gave me the perfect reason to do so) and life is much more livable now. With this, I can also get why focusing on what I want in life would lead to better results. The overall message in this DVD is deeper than this but there are some interesting things that have occurred in my life thanks to my shift in thinking. I understand that everything can't be for everybody. However, for the low price of the DVD, there isn't much to lose here even if you end up totally disagreeing with me. Listen to it closely because there are some rather subtle and key items that I picked up on after watching it many times over. Also try ""The Secret Daily Teachings"" book and ""The Secret audio cd"" to get an even more in depth view of what is going on here.",1419984000,,1115,4.214953271028038

1596857,2,B00005JPJ8,I guess I should have read the description. I bought this based on a recommendation that is was a must-see movie. It's not a movie at all in the traditional sense. It's just a bunch of self help people rambling on. I'm not saying there is no good content. I didn't get through it all. My plan was to relax and watch a movie. This is more like something you might listen to in the car on a long trip. There's really no need to see the people talking.,1417737600,,449,4.056179775280899
1596858,3,B00005JPJ8,"The video music and intros are a little too dramatic for my taste... I felt like I was about to watch an intense thriller instead of a motivational video.

It goes on and on about how positive thinking makes a difference - citing ""John"" or ""Bob"" or a story of ""someone"" who encountered wonders just with positive thinking - for one I don't see any connection in the turning out of events except that person got lucky.
I read the book till the end in one day expecting something to come up... To those of you considering reading this book, let me summarize it for you...""Positive thinking makes wonders..."" period.

I was lucky enough to have such good things happen in my life.

Now he too, will know the secret.

1598610,2,B00005JPJ8,"I've heard about the book for years and have a few friends that swear by it so I decided to check out the video version.

While I completely agree with the power of positive thinking and that it can change your life, because it worked for me, I just can't buy into the fact that they're preaching more about thoughts and not actions.  I believe that your thoughts control outcomes BUT to a point.  For example, I don't believe, and this is just my opinion, that you can ask for a million dollars and think positively about it for a number of days and it'll just arrive at some point.  If it were that simple then everyone would be doing it.  You have to work towards that goal and those positive thoughts will help you get there but not hand it over to you without any effort.

I think this book preys on the weak-minded, depressed, and/or desperate people which is a shame.  It came across as more of an infomercial than anything else.  It was jam-packed with philosophers, ministers and new age types that are usually associated with these types of theories which immediately raises a ""quack"" flag for me.",1406505600,4,1107,4.472636815920398

1598872,4,B00005JPJ8,"This movie is not 100% correct, but it comes very close to teaching you how to view reality.  With hope, with responsibility, with thoughtfulness, with optimism.  This movie really draws you in and causes you to think about reality in a different way.  It causes you to view your place in reality with a more psycho-scientific-spiritual understanding and acceptance.  Most importantly, it allows you leave old dogmas and religious chains behind.  It has you thinking for yourself, not looking to a TV or pastor or fear-mongering government for your viewpoint.

I'd say this is a wonderful FIRST STEP for those who are waking up to reality as a co-created phenomenon.  While the movie is preoccupied with the ""Law of Attraction,"" it totally ignores the more serious ""laws"" of the universe that occult practitioners have known about for thousands of years before the iron hands of Abrahamic religions took control of the West.

So, after you get inspired by the documentary, try dipping your hands into these excellent books:

1) Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth: An Introduction to Spiritual Ecology by John Michael Greer
2) The Kybalion: A Study of The Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece by The Three Initiates

My only problems with this film was two fold.  1) The film talked about ""a power"", but never gave credit as to what or who the power was.  That kind of bothered me a bit.  The second was the length of it.  I don't know how long it was, but it could have been easily 1/3 the length and still make just as good ( or perhaps better ) an impact.  There was a lot of redundancy that got a little annoying after a while.

The power we have within our mind is a great power. A power that we can use for bringing good or bad stuff into our lives. That might be a hard pill to swallow but that is the law. Just because you do not know about the law does not mean it is not working in our lives. This movie changed my life. I am now very careful about the words I speak to myself and to others. After you watch this movie wait a few weeks and watch it again.

1599111,1,B00005JPJ8,"(Just so you know, I borrowed this instead of buying it. Good thing, too: it would have been a waste of money.) I can hardly believe people of intelligence who are the talking heads on ""The Secret"" program actually believe the things they're saying! Among the idiotic claims are:
1. Negative thoughts are always dangerous.
2. Being ""against"" something makes more of that something happen, while being ""for"" something makes it ABSOLUTELY happen.
3. Whatever you desire can come true if you just believe it can and put yourself in a state of mind to make it happen.
4. If you get what you want, you will be happy and stay happy.
5. God is energy, and so we are ""the universe becoming more conscious of itself"". (If everything is God, then where did evil come from? That's only one of the issues I find with this philosophical claim.)
6. Everyone's different dreams of what they want life to be like can coexist harmoniously. (Where does the Third Reich come into that picture? Where do other evil agendas?)

The few kernels of truth it has are swallowed up in a bunch of nonsense about impulsive living, getting whatever you want just because you choose to believe it's already yours, bla bla bla. The few kernels of truth are quantum physics-based, and for most people, would be hard to sort out from the claptrap. Here's what I have concluded is actually legit about its philosophy:
1. Taking time to form ideas (thoughts associated with images and feelings) about your goals is very important for shaping your destiny--to the extent you actually can, which the movie absurdly says is 100% in your control.
2. Don't focus on what you don't want as much as on what you want instead. (Where the movie stupidly gets it wrong is in claiming that bad things keep happening because people talk about being anti-terrorism and anti-war and anti-drugs. It's not because of the idea ""anti-war"" that war continues!!) There is some truth to one idea it presents, though, which is that if you present your candidate just as standing against the other candidate's positions, your candidate tends to lose. The Republican Party today is mostly just anti-Obama rather than presenting its own vision and explaining why it's better than Obama's, and I'm sure that's part of why it's not effective at getting the changes it wants. But it's ridiculous to think, like the movie's philosophy, that being ""anti-slavery"" instead of ""pro-freedom"" is why there's so much ""negative energy"" and conflict, as if the abolitionists could have prevented the Civil War by being ""pro-freedom"". They already were pro-freedom, or else they'd not have done the Underground Railroad!!
3. Don't focus on something you want being hard to achieve. If you focus on the difficulty, it diminishes your motivation and also diminishes your desire. The strength of your desire makes the fulfillment of it more likely--but again, NOT a guarantee, while the movie claims it is an 100% reliable thing.
4. Focus on feeling good about your dream, taking time to feel the feelings associated with having what you want. Again, the stupid movie claims it's a certainty you'll get what you want. The truth is that it is a healthy psychological exercise to keep you hopeful about the future, and keeps you open to new ways of making that future a reality, but there are many factors which can keep it from coming true. The movie is very selective in its examples, to try to say it's all your own doing. I can think of many examples where people who dream of a certain kind of life don't get that, because of a child getting run over by a car or a wife not being able to conceive, and more. It is hard for me to believe this doesn't even cross the minds of the many talking heads on this pseudo-scientific documentary! Their view lines up with Christian Science that your mind is in total control over your health.

Then they have the audacity to say their teachings line up with the Bible and Buddha about being connected to the energy force of the universe and about what makes people happy, apparently unaware that the Apostle Paul in the Bible was happy AND suffering because he was looking to the hope of life after death, and unaware that Buddhism extols suffering as the path to happiness. It's dishonest about both religions by leaving suffering out of the picture. It also, not surprisingly, neglects the Apostle Paul's account of a ""thorn in the flesh"" in 2 Corinthians, which he wanted to eliminate but couldn't, a physical ailment which was causing him lots of trouble. Yet he had a positive attitude about ""suffering for Christ""--but couldn't eliminate his ailment through positive thinking. ""The Secret"" doesn't present any such complexity. It also makes it sound like material and relationship gain is what life is all about, what will ultimately satisfy: it ignores the history of the Hollywood movie business, which proves that those people have sordid and unhappy lives as a rule, in spite of having material and relationship gain. The REAL ""Secret"" is how to keep a relationship healthy, but that's not mentioned EVEN ONCE!

It also claims that people who have had wealth throughout history got it because they focused on getting what they wanted, which is horribly disrespectful to the memory of those who have suffered throughout history. It claims no one but you yourself can determine your destiny or tell you what to do, which means justice is of your own making. That means the obscenely powerful kings of old like Louis XIV were self-made individuals who are accountable to no one but themselves, while the paupers had only themselves to blame and were accountable to the king because they focused on the negative things about their lives. ""The Secret"" is a disrespect to their memory.

One of the most glaring idiocies of ""The Secret"" is that they still don't have an answer for death. Focusing on the thought ""I want to live"" instead of ""I don't want to die"" won't keep you from eventually dying. It also has no explanation for evil, and says getting money and impulsive buying are good things and that if you just trust it will work out, you can act recklessly and be happy. You can be happy without being responsible, suffering, or sacrificing. WHAT?!

With only 4 kernels of truth in the entire thing, and far more absurd claims, I wish I could give it HALF a star. Notice that even in the 4 kernels, I kept having to correct how ""The Secret"" twisted them.",1403913600,,6428,4.756272401433692

This actually makes sense from a psychological perspective from what little I know of psychology (I don't know much but I DO know about the power of affirmations) except the psychologist don't take things to this extreme. This is what I have been searching for. Looking over my life I see how the things I have feared have been attracted to me - the things I have wished for too, thoughts aren't easy to change but it's worth doing. I learned that from my years in therapy. I am willing to believe in the possibilities of what I can create. If I believe this isn't possible then I have less power. To me, I would rather feel empowerment then despair and to believe in the secret gives me that feeling of empowerment. Positive thinking works wonders on the body's immune system. Why not on one's life? Give it a chance. If it works, it works. So far I Have attracted things to me. Nothing big - just little things. If it's coincidence then I hope that I can make this grow into bigger coincidences. :)",1400976000,4,1069,4.35

Make sure to project humble thoughts of helpfullness and love and friendship towards others.

Often our thoughts are habitual and we do not realize how or what we think that is harmful to us.  All ""thought"" is cause.

1600202,3,B00005JPJ8,"This is a good DVD with a lot of feel good elements and good advice, but I feel it focuses on just 1 smaller part of achieving. It gives insight into 1 tiny part of success. There really is a lot more to life. There's working hard to achieve things, giving back to the community and loved ones, making right choices,competition, luck, making a difference in other people's lives,proper communication, building self esteem, there's prayer, timing, faith, love, being healthy and a whole lot more extremely complex elements to success. This film may help spark a road to success but does not give you every necessary tool or secret. It may help twist people to a better attitude. But I feel this film is still a necessary watch for a lot of people as long as they add what is necessary to achieve whatever goal they have and to find what is real in their hearts and not just materialistic possessions. This film is just one point of view against millions, people will walk away forming their own opinions, speculations, criticisms, likes, dislikes, ideas.

1600647,1,B00005JPJ8,"Strictly speaking, this film isn't a movie as most people would expect from the name or from the flashy trailer that implies a film on the order of the Dan Brown stories.  It's nothing remotely like that.  It's not a story like a fictional novel (although some people might consider fiction...tongue-in-cheek).  This film is a ""documentary style"" portrayal of a bunch of people's opinions...they talk about and endorse the ""secret"" of living, which they **keep** secret for quite a while after the film is underway.  (1) Shooting for suspense?  (2) Hoping you'll keep watching long enough you feel committed to finishing it no matter how you feel about it?  I totally forgot I watched it quite some time ago (which says something).  When my husband and I started watching it and the first ""endorser"" tells you there's a secret (but not what it is), then I remembered it.  We both usually stick with a movie hoping it will get better, but I don't think we even got through 5 minutes before we quit.  Good thing it was free as part of Amazon Prime!  I would have been pretty ticked off if I'd paid for it.

It's intended to uplifting I guess, but we found it more annoying because the title, trailer, and beginning are misleading.  If you expect that going into it maybe you'll like it.  I consider myself a version of a ""spiritual"" person (hint about ""story""...), but when I originally watched the whole thing, I found it to be overly dramatic, sort of sappy, and I was definitely annoyed that it was misrepresented.  Why did I finish watching it?  Despite wanting to stop very early on (once I'd ""discovered"" the ""secret""), I'm one of those stubborn sorts that believes in finishing what I started (count me as a Number 2, above).  By the end I'd have to say I ""kinda sorta"" agree with the basic underlying premise, but this is a bit over the top, bordering on fanatical with carefully scripted non-fanatical type presentation.  Some might like it, but my opinion?  Bottom line...yuk... (I guess the film makers and endorsers of the secret of life would consider me a lost cause.)",1393459200,,2080,4.683195592286501

However, Rhonda Byrne took advantages of these people and their generosity. Then she pocketed all the profits herself. She even took advantage of her partner/director of the dvd and she stole his idea for the concept of the dvd. That's why she was sued. Rhonda Byrne stole ideas and teachings from the experts that have been around for a while. Then she re-packaged it and made it seem like it's her idea. Now she calls herself an expert.

1600959,5,B00005JPJ8,"I had wondered why my life was so messed up.  I internally asked what was out there to help me understand how to change things. Then this dvd showed up. In my opinion it isn't the gospel all truth that makes life a fairytale.  However, it starts you on a journey of actually being able to control your own thoughts and feelings in order to change the ""effect"" around you.
  Try this after watching the ""Secret"":  Notice your patterns of negative thoughts and reverse them and feel them and see if this is all a bunch of bull.  You might keep a notebook handy and notice you are feeling good and wonder why.  It has taken me a long time to put this to the test, and in my opinion, it really does work.
  If there were two things I would recommend for myself to have known about, it would be:  ""The Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne and ""The Book of  Afformations""  by Noah St. John.  These two items have changed my life and I have ordered so many self-help books in the past.
  My attitude has changed to knowing I can ask for what I choose to happen in my life. It is such a great feeling to find something that ACTUALLLY WORKS!  No matter how negative your life may be, these two items will definitely change your life to the positive.  You will find that you will be making up stuff you never would have believed you could have by applying the Secret and Afformations.  The conditions you find yourself experiencing are only the effect of the thoughts and feelings that you choose to entertain. Change your thoughts and feelings, put affirmations into question form, and you will be amazed at the way your life changes  toward happiness.  These new changes you can write down in your journey along with your gratitude list.
  To be honest, I really did think that keeping a gratitude list and changing my thoughts was dumb. I admit I was mistaken. I am practicing what I have written here for anyone who is bold enough to take action. Purchase these two items and I dare you to watch your life BE WHO YOU HAPPILY REALLY ARE.",1391212800,4,2017,4.365591397849462

Your thoughts form your reality. To summarize the secret, positive thoughts will lead to positive things happening in your life. It may not always work that way, but at least you are in the right frame of mind. Meanwhile negative thinking surely will not lead you to accomplishing the things you want in life. ""I think therefore I am"". Analyze your thoughts, your attitudes, your feelings and your belief systems. Is there anything in there that is preventing you from achieving the things you want in life. Don't look outside, but look inside you and see what things within yourself that you need to change. Change the way you think and you will change your life.

1601301,2,B00005JPJ8,"My review is not the subject matter that is talked about but the way it is presented.  This is not a secret and has not been hidden away from the public, the problem with people like this is that they want to make money off of a long time idea...by making it sound new.

This movie does what most religion does...If you didn't get what you were trying to manifest then you didn't try hard enough or you didn't do it right.  They give themselves an out, if this doesn't work.  According to this, two people with opposite ideas should get what they want if they attract the correct way...well what happens if it collides with the other person's desire?

The truth is this had a lot of good points: stay positive, if you want your life to change then you have to change, whatever you put out there comes back to you, etc...  But the one thing they don't mention is that sometimes LIFE HAPPENS!  The real ""secret"" that isn't a secret, but people tend to forget is...we cannot control what comes into our path, but we can control how we react to it.

This is an outright insult to anybody who is undergoing crisis or trauma in their lives.  Negative thoughts create tragedy?  Really?  Tell that to the millions of children all over the world with leukemia.  Tell that to the parent of a severely disabled child.  Tell that to the family of an innocent murder victim.  Tell that to a holocaust victim.  Tell that to the millions of people dying in poverty.  You mean to tell me their mind brought this on???  Something is not right with this theory.

From my experience, people who support this pollyanna horse crap are nothing more than arrogant, pompous idiots who never experienced a tragedy in their life--if they did, they wouldn't promote this false ideology.  Rhonda Byrne & the others who push this propaganda should stop mocking people that are experiencing crisis in their lives--there are no guarantees in life, and walking around thinking happy thoughts does not prevent castrophes.  I'm pretty sure many murder victims were in a good mood the day someone took their lives.  What happens when Byrne & the others who push this crap are put to the test and have the rug pulled out from under them?  Do they think they are impervious to tragedy?

1601430,5,B00005JPJ8,"Its important to distinguish the material vs the movie.  You might not like a particular subject matter but you really shouldn't let that affect your review of the quality of the movie.  My review encompasses both the material and the movie.  I have heard concepts like ""you are what you think"" or ""you become what you think"" but I never fully understood this concept until after watching this movie.  Since then I have watched a decent amount of movies in this genre and I state emphatically, none of them come close to the quality and film making craftsmanship that this movie offers.

This is not an easy subject to tackle but i think the director and producers did a fantastic job delivering the material and providing an interesting and entertaining way to deliver the information.

This is absolutely a 5 star production, which I think was assembled on a relatively shoe string budget.  It makes it all the more interesting.

As for the material.  I personally found it to be life changing. I was starting a business at the time and was very scared.  I was essentially risking everything I had at that point.  It was really tough to keep my mind positive when there didn't appear at that time, many things to support those positive feelings.  This movie kept my mind on track and I went from 0 income to doing over $740,000 in one year.

If you look at really successful people they typically do follow this formula whether it is conscious or not.  Successful people keep their attention and focus on the outcome of what they want, unsuccessful people don't.  I highly encourage you to watch this movie and eventually buy this movie.  It will pay for itself many times over.",1385942400,2,1680,4.663265306122449
1601431,2,B00005JPJ8,"I'm glad I got to watch this for free under my Prime account because it wasn't worth paying for. The Secret is New Age love n' light fluff at best.  The ""Law"" of Attraction operates under the premise that we are all entitled to be happy, healthy, and wealthy all the time if we only use our thoughts to will it into existence.  That is ""The Secret."" The film claims that the top 1% of the wealthiest people used this ""Secret"" to attain their riches- really, it's that simple!  Just visualize those dollars and they will be yours!  Likewise, you can visualize away such maladies as breast cancer and paralysis according to this film. If bad things are happening to you, it's because you are expending too much thought energy on the negative.  So by this logic, it would seemingly follow that women who are raped got what they deserved because they somehow spent too much time thinking about being raped, or that abused children must have invited abuse with their negative thoughts.  Makes sense, right?

I do believe that positive thinking and the ""attitude of gratitude"" discussed in the film can go a long way at helping to keep us focused on our goals.  However, the danger of ""The Secret"" is that it blames the victim for the things that go wrong in life.  The truth is that we can't all be ""happy, healthy, and wealthy"" all the time, nor are we meant to be.  Life is hard, and getting ahead requires hard work.  The Secret chooses to ignore this reality, focusing instead on a fantasy world where everyone can have whatever they want as long as they think happy thoughts.  The Universe doesn't work that way.  Sometimes bad things happen for reasons we can't understand, and this film minimizes the experiences of those who are suffering or even assigns blame to them. Especially disturbing was the scene with the gay man who complained to his therapist about being bullied by his homophobic coworkers. His therapist told him to think positive in order to stop the bullying.  This kind of magical thinking denies the reality of homophobia and the difficulties faced by LGBT folks every day. I also found it annoying that the film constantly uses quotes from visionaries such as Einstein and Dr. Martin Luther King to suggest that they somehow support the concepts discussed in the film.  I suspect they would turn over in their graves if they knew their ideas were being used in this scam.

Life is not supposed to be perfect all the time.  If it were, we would lose out on rich opportunities for growth and self-improvement.  The Secret promotes a get-something-for-nothing mentality and suggests that we are entitled to have whatever we want.  It's a lovely fantasy, but that's all it is- a fantasy.  I'm giving this film two stars because I like its message of staying positive and expressing gratitude on a regular basis, but otherwise, it's garbage.  It's ironic that Rhonda Byrne is making lots of money off this bunk because she is truly getting something for nothing by selling this ridiculous concept.  If you want real, practical advice on changing negative thought patterns, I suggest reading Feeling Good by Dr. David Burns.",1385769600,3,3140,4.7440147329650095

You haven't been diligent enough in your ""visualization""! You must not really really believe it will happen!
It's all bull

It does contain a lot of great interviews and stories about creating a positive life for yourself through discipline, but doesn't give all that much practical advice. It's a lot of fluff that restates other people's ideas on manifestation. Truly, nothing new under the sun here. I would give her five stars for marketing brilliance, though.

1601522,1,B00005JPJ8,"Someone turned me onto this DVD touting how great it was. I can go as far as to say that thoughts can and do determine outlook on life. However, to claim that bad things happen to you, like a traffic ticket or a car accident, because you brought them on yourself is just outright nonsense. So, basically if you are raped, your house burns down, you are molested, or sold into sex trafficking, you brought that on yourself because of your ""negative energy""? Any person can see that this is utter nonsense. Then to top it off the solution,  or way out, is to start thinking positively, think of all the positive traits your captors possess, or abusive spouse, or rapist, or whatever - and the universe will begin channeling your energy to make things better for you. What nonsense!!!! Of course, these extreme examples are not mentioned in the video - rather softer examples are given according to western thought and culture. But if you apply this across the board and carry this line of thought completely out, then you have to apply to all contexts in all cultures and societies. Do your homework - the New Thought Movement is a scam - it elevates man above all else - naturalism and humanism at its finest - ""true human selfhood is divine, divine thought is a force for good, sickness originates in the mind, and ""right thinking"" has a healing effect"". Nothing more than a group of people who have developed an idea that tickles peoples ears and makes them rich. Yeah, I can imagine checks showing up in the mail, or a new car appearing in the drive way. Give me a break! Twenty or thirty years ago if I walked into a doctors office and made these claims I would be diagnosed as delusional and borderline psychotic and handed a one-way ticket to the looney bin. Nowadays, this is called New Age or New Thought.

1601600,5,B00005JPJ8,This movie focuses on the dormant power that we humans have that most of us are not aware of.  This movie was about the wonders of positive thinking.,1381795200,,149,4.321428571428571
1601601,2,B00005JPJ8,"I was both surprised at how much of what was recommended are things I do and yet how far short the movie falls at the very end. After promising happiness, health, and wealth, we are told everything hinges on the law of attraction. We attract what we think about most. ""Thoughts become things."" ""What you think about you bring about.""

While there is no need to discredit what is valid here, I am concerned that ""success"" is reduced to one law. Might there not be more laws or principles? Is this an oversimplification?

Eastern mysticism taught that the secret was the elimination of desires. Western materialism uses ""the secret"" to get what we want. I am also concerned that this principle might be corrupted by appealing to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Realistically, we do have needs, but the balance is to give thanks for what we do have, trust God for what we need, submit to his providence, allow him to purify our desires, and pray for his guidance. I have not actually needed everything I thought I wanted. The country song written to express this realization was titled, ""Thank God for unanswered prayers.""

The film teaches that thoughts cause feelings and that we should seek good feelings. This happens in three steps:

1. Ask or make a command to the universe
 2. Believe that it is already yours
 3. Receive - turn fantasy into fact

This is not a new magic formula. Phoebe Palmer began teaching this as a shortcut to faith for sanctification in the 1850s, except that the asking was directed to God, not to the universe. It was later applied by the faith healers and then by the prosperity gospel. It is generally referred to as ""name it and claim it."" This metaphysical philosophy was brought into the church through E. W. Kenyon a hundred years ago. The term ""metaphysical"" refers to that which lies beyond the physical realm.

Yet true faith is based on God's Word. We must ask according to God's will. What we have on the film is a generic version without the Christian terminology. The law of ""the universe"" is constantly appealed to, as though ""the universe"" was God. We were encouraged to have faith, but it was never clear what was to be the object of our faith. Scripture, however, is clear that every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father through Jesus Christ.

We were then encouraged to develop an attitude of gratitude. There is no problem here. Paul said, ""In everything give thanks."" We were also encouraged to visualize. ""When you visualize you materialize."" Visualization can be either good or bad. I think it is helpful to visualize the stories of the Bible. But we cannot create reality simply by visualizing it. We perish without a vision, but we must pray until God gives the vision.

Yet the promise of the film is that what we can visualize, we can materialize. Wealth is dealt with first, then relationship, and finally health. But there is a difference between psychosomatic illness and physiological disease. That is why faith healers tend to avoid certain types of problems. If you arm has been cut off, you cannot grow it back through visualization. However, if your illness was caused by anxiety or anger, a good attitude adjustment can produce physical results.

The basic assumption at this point in the film is that we have the power of creation. Here the distinction between the Creator and the creation is blurred. God has the power of creation and he simply spoke the universe into existence. But we are not gods. Toward the end we then got a fairly heavy dose of new age philosophy.

New age philosophy is actually old Eastern mysticism. Both teach that God is an impersonal force (the universe), that the Creator and the creation are one (monism), that everything is God (pantheism), that all religions are one, that life is governed by karma (the law of cause and effect which determines fate), and that we are evolving into a new world order. All this is taught or implied in the film. The film especially emphasized that everything is energy and that God is energy. The result is that God is a force. Yet the Bible reveals God as a person or being with all power.

It was also asserted that everything is connected and ""you are eternal life."" Then we were told ""you are God manifested in human form."" No. Jesus Christ was God manifested in the flesh. That is what the Incarnation means. But there is an important distinction between saying that we are God and that we are created in the image of God. To be in the image of God means, in part, that we were created in righteousness and holiness. Unfortunately, this was lost through the Fall and can only be restored through faith in Jesus Christ.

The image of God also consists of reason, will, and freedom. We have not lost these qualities, but our reason is darkened, our will is perverted, and we choose wrong over right. The image of God is also the responsibility of mankind as steward and caretaker of creation. While the doctrine of creation in God's image and likeness is comprehensive, it does NOT mean that we are God.

Therefore the concept of unlimited potential does not apply to humans. There are limits  even if we could attain much more. By definition, God alone has unlimited potential. And yet strictly speaking, God cannot do anything inconsistent with his nature. For example God cannot lie. However, the reason the film declares we have unlimited potential is because it teaches that we are gods. Then we are told that there is no blackboard in the sky on which our purpose for life is written. However, those who are the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God. God does have a plan or purpose for our lives and while it is not written on a blackboard, it may be discovered through prayer and obedience in the life of the believer.

Finally we are told that in the past only a few people knew the secret but these are the best days in which to live because now the secret is out and man can evolve to a higher level. There is no need to be concerned with social justice, just seek personal fulfillment. But the most fulfilled people are those who devote themselves to helping others and advancing the kingdom of God on earth.

At the very close we are told that through the film we have already been introduced to many of the world's great ""avatars."" This is a pagan term and concept meaning the incarnation of any god into any living form. In Hindu teaching an avatar is a reincarnation of Vishnu  the supreme being or ultimate reality.

Yet Jesus Christ is the only incarnation of God. According to 1 John 4:2-3 to deny the unique incarnation of Jesus Christ is the spirit of antichrist. Please note that the prefix ""anti"" can mean ""in place of."" Therefore to teach that we are God manifested in the flesh is to trust in self instead of in Christ.

This film is rather simplistic in its philosophy and overstates its case. We need to be cautious about the pagan presuppositions on which it is based. I suspect that the real purpose of the film is to introduce the concept of karma and the value of meditation in changing our karma. Yet the good news of the gospel is the concept of mercy and grace  not an impersonal law of cause and effect, but that through Christ we do not get what we do deserve and that we do get what we do not deserve.

Yet there is no need to throw out the baby with the bath water. There is no virtue in negative thinking. In that sense, a positive mental attitude is not a secret. Norman Vincent Peale taught that fifty years ago. However, a PMA is not the same as true faith. The faith which can move mountains is a gift which comes from God, which is based on his Word, and which operates according to his will. Unfortunately, all this was left out of The Secret.

In closing I am afraid that the cultural Christianity of America is not as appealing as ""the secret"" because many churches are controlled by people who have never been born again. They do not live by Scripture and are not filled with the Spirit. If Christ walked into the average church on Sunday morning to preach he would get kicked out. And so I am advocating a true Christianity which our culture has never seen but rejects because the nominal Christianity they have seen has left a bad taste in their mouth. However, to give an example of what I mean, read Paul's prayer for those in the church at Ephesus in Ephesians 1:18-23. Paul prays that we might get our eyes opened to the hope of his calling, the riches of our glorious inheritance, and the might of the divine power made available to us.

We are called to experience the treasury of blessings for the people of God in time and in eternity. Our glorious inheritance does not mean the glory of heaven, but the present manifestation of the glory of grace in believers who are gradually perfected into one' through their union with the Redeemer. This resurrection power has already raised the dead sinner to life and will raise our bodies from physical death in the future. In the present, we sit in heavenly places with the resurrected Christ and he exercises his authority through us.

While this is just one of many such prayers in the New Testament, if we really could grasp the possibilities available to us through the grace of God, a film like ""the secret"" would come across as pretty hollow.",1381795200,,9334,4.550983899821109

1602129,3,B00005JPJ8,"I finally watched this for the first time.  I've heard of ""The Secret"" for years.  Everybody talking about, ""The Secret"".  They would say, ""Oh my God you have to watch the Secret.""  Well, I watched it and I was not blown away.  Great stuff in it, but there is no ""secret"".  They should have called this the ""Law of Attraction"" because that's what they are talking about all throughout it.  Unfortunately, because they call it ""the secret"", they made it out to be this overly hyped marketing piece which feels deceptive.  Everything they talk about in the video is right on though.  However the execution and creation of this DVD feels more like a 90 minute marketing video to promote the 'law of attraction'.  The Law of Attraction has been around for centuries.  Anyone that can think for themselves can figure out that you attract in what you give out.  I suppose there are millions of people who have trouble wrapping their minds around this concept.  So for them, this is a great DVD to watch.  It's simple and easy to understand.

They more or less hammer down the law of attraction throughout this DVD.  The one thing they do leave out is that its not enough to think positively and how to do so, but that you will need to take some action steps.  You can't just sit on your couch all day thinking positively and expecting that to bring in results.  I found this DVD okay.  I already understand the subject matter, but I thought there was this major 'secret' that no one knew.  Many know about the law of attraction.  I'm glad I watched this DVD, but I guess I expected more with all of the hype surrounding it.  They just had a great gimmick and packaged that perfectly enough to 'attract' in millions of viewers.  This isn't bad as its all positive stuff, but it's just too repetitive.  If you don't understand the law of attraction concepts then I'd recommend checking this out.  It may also be a great re-fresher for those who feel they are bathed in too much negativity.",1377129600,,1981,4.512676056338028

1602132,1,B00005JPJ8,"I'm guessing that the 4/5 star rating for this movie is due to the fact that any sane person would want to turn this movie off before their eyeballs are burnt out of their sockets, and forget what they saw before they feel the compulsion to run off and join a cult (the Moonies? Scientology?). These people would not want to be reminded about the film, so they would not write a review.

I, on the other hand, watched just enough so that I will use the cosmic powers of Attraction to attract some sanity (imagine a mysterious almost-invisible wave emanating from my body as I write this and permeating my living room, the surrounding trees, and finally you, the reader).

Try not to be too negative. Be a positive, enthusiastic person. Be happy. But do yourself a favor.

Everybody should be taught about this from an early age, but strangely enough, virtually nobody seems to know about it. This video will introduce you to attraction and give you the tools to have literally anything you want. Don't believe me??

1602262,5,B00005JPJ8,"I half expected this was going to be religious. It wasn't. I haven't read the book, but i feel as though the video would be better to understand.

""the secret"" will sound really stupid if you have never experienced it, but this ""secret"" is very real, very true. Though i wouldn't say you attract things in your life to you, but that you guide yourself onto that path in your life.

I always wondered why when i thought about someone who i haven't seen in yrs or months, why they would suddenly show up back into my life soon after. And not from me trying to contact them, but they contract me.. In that way, though, i guess that would be attracting things into your life.

I always wondered why when the teacher is looking to call on someone in class, i can just feel her about to call on me. And what happened? She calls on me. So i tried thinking hard that she will not call on me. And she wouldn't call on me.

I think that's a simple example, something many people could have possibly experienced.

I'm now 20. Always noticing how things i want just happen. I don't really control my life. I just think about it. Don't think about the negatives things. In a way, this will guide you to the life path you want or are thinking about. Whether it be negative or positive.

It cannot be explained very well. But this has been my experience. I've been practicing it for the past few yrs and it has proven to be true over and over again.

This video just proved to me my theory and now i don't feel so alone with this -_- though i kind of wish it was kept a secret..",1376092800,,1563,4.19

1602306,5,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD is awesome!

Many times we do not understand why we work so hard and can never get ahead and that is because we speak despair into our lives, such as, ""I Can Not Do This or That"", ""No One Understands Me"", ""I Always Get Sick"", ""I Am Not Good Enough,"" and ETC... These words alone are powerful and come to life because we speak them. It is like ""Karma"" what we speak is what we become.

This DVD goes into detail of how we can change our negative words, thoughts, and actions into positive ones. There are many speakers from different professions speaking in this video so you get a well rounded foundation of how powerful words, thoughts, and actions are in life. Although this is not a religious video it does talk about many things that many would not think is written in the bible such as:

James 4:2-3
Amplified Bible (AMP)

2. You are jealous and covet [what others have] and your desires go unfulfilled; [so] you become murderers. [To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned.] You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain [the gratification, the contentment, and the happiness that you seek], so you fight and war. You do not have, because you do not ask.

3. [Or] you do ask [God for them] and yet fail to receive, because you ask with wrong purpose and evil, selfish motives. Your intention is [when you get what you desire] to spend it in sensual pleasures.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who does not understand the law of the universe and how we attract negative things to us.",1375920000,6,1527,4.3780918727915195
1602307,5,B00005JPJ8,"This movie was new, complete in a secure wrapped covering. The clarity was excellent. The price was exceptionally reasonable. We love it.",1375833600,,137,5.2727272727272725
1602308,1,B00005JPJ8,"This idea is not new...
The ""Isaiah Effect"" by Gregg Braden and ""What to Say When you Talk To Yourself"" by  Shad Helmstetter are two examples of the basic theme of ""you can create your reality by how you ""think"".

Most of it is New Age horse-poo. The idea that there is an ""energy"" to facilitate the manifestations of your desires is ridiculous. Ironically, it can't be disproved because if the mystical energy isn't working for you, then it is the fault of your technique. Who's to say that a magic power IS available to all of us, but we just don't have the skills to call upon the power.

I could, in theory, sell a special crystal and claim that if you rub it while chanting a special prayer you'd be healed of all your sicknesses. If you don't pray precisely as I say, with perfect thoughts, you will fail. Your failure wouldn't be my fault because I pointed out that if you weren't doing it correctly you would fail. I could make a bundle, except that I happen to have a conscience, and a lot more morals than the author that wrote ""The Secret"".

The real ""power"" is when you act upon the positive thoughts you create. When you really believe you can do something, then you tend to do things that help you to achieve the goal. Don't expect a pot of gold to appear out of thin air, but expect a certain chain of events to unfold because you physically went into action and caused them to happen. The wealth might come because you bought stock in a new company, applied for that sales job, or finally started that new business.

If you need more than this read the Bible, particularly Proverbs and the Scriptures it leads you to. In this documentary it speaks without saying it ""the Christ mind,"" ""as a man thinketh so is he,"" ""a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways,"" ""ask and you shall have it,"" ""you have not because you ask not,"" ""if you ask for a thing believe without wavering and you shall have it,"" ""we are blessed with all spiritual blessings,"" and so on.

What it says is 99% correct..

the 1% that is not correct is the fact that it completely ignores the law of ""cause and effect"" which is an equally important law to the law of attraction.

To put a long story short.. the law of cause and effect may intervene in some cases to prevent something from happening (If the occurrence of this event would be to the detriment of the person who would experience it

Not sure if this omission was on purpose or due to ignorance.. but in anyway i find the DVD very very good

If you believe that you can't change your life alone and life is ticking over, then you need to change your thinking.  Be happy and optimistic whatever path you choose to attain this.

I couldn't help being negative about the people around me and my horrid past.  This taught me to think about what I want instead and it worked at the age of 42.  Your mind is really the key to what you want.

The only difference between success and failure is your mind and your thinking.  Stop listening to negative people, unless they can offer you a better way, which I very much doubt they will.

This is good regardless of your faith or religion.

I learned that the positive mindset can open the doors of the things you want.

If you project too much negativity, it will prevent you from achieving the things you want in life.

All rich people in the word practice the law of attraction, whether they know it or not.

1. Imagine that you already have it.

2. Release it to the universe. Don't dwell on it. Use the Law Of Detachment. Imagine it and forget about it until the next time you imagine it.

1602699,3,B00005JPJ8,"The book ""The Secret"" got me into the LOA concept in the first place. Since then I have read books of 2 more authors about this topic and a few days ago had the chance to view the DVD free of charge.
I was disappointed - if I had paid money to watch the DVD, I would have felt cheated. In my eyes this movie is not much more than rehashing the book's contents. Even though I have read the book over a year ago I could still remember having read exactly the same sentences I was watching people say on-screen. Admittedly, the vigour with which some of the participants deliver their belief helped driving home the point.
Also, the whole setup was much too dramatic for my taste, too tabloid-y.

The concept of LOA is basically a Think Positive approach which isn't exactly new. ""The Secret"" may be a good introduction into that subject and might arouse your curiosity. However, what I disliked in both the book and the DVD was the fact that they are giving next to nothing in terms of how to apply ""The Secret"" in day-to-day life. To anyone interested in putting it into practice I recommend Jonathan Manske's ""The Law Of Attraction Made Simple"" (book) instead.",1367020800,,1160,4.471698113207547

I wanted her to attend the same type of ""training"" I had experienced, but it seemed time, money, and availability of the ""training"" never quite seemed to all be working in harmony. I shared as much information as I could, but she was skeptical and easily confused by some of the terminology. When The Secret came out I watched it, and was WOW! So I shared it with her, and SHE GOT IT! After speaking to a good friend who attended the same ""training"" I did, he introduced us to What The Bleep Do We Know, which further grounded my understanding and broadened hers. Know we are avid students and users of LOA, both starting businesses to teach people of all ages how to use LOA, and experience more fulfilling lives through gratitude and stewardship training as well. The Secret yes could be more in depth, but to someone who is completely ignorant that much depth could be overwhelming. To someone who is a skeptic, that much depth could turn the curiosity switch off.

-Somehow think that the time of year you were born on has anything to do with your personality (i'm talking about horoscopes)
-Think the earth is the center of the universe, or follow a religion that once did
-And many other things level-minded peopled on the whole would deem silly or absurd

then there's a possibility you may enjoy part of this movie and might even buy into it.

However, if you think the things mentioned in the aforementioned items are complete garbage, as I do, then don't bother watching this and for the love of Zeus please don't support it in any way. The results claimed from using ""the secret"" are what you'd obtain simply by believing in yourself, giving whatever it is your all, and persevering without rest. Well, that's what the secret essentially has you do, though the end result is incorrectly credited to a mysterious universal force. I'd liken it to those of faith attributing someones great accomplishment to ""the lords work"" instead of giving that individual their due credit.

I have seen it many times over the last 5 yrs, it's that good. My son has been transformed because of this movie. He watched it every day for months, and as a result, he gave up cigarettes, drugs, drinking. He is now a healthier, happier young man, and it all started with this incredible movie.

BUT, the way it is treated makes this video look cheap and not serious.
What is a true pity, because it is very serious.
It is not a film, it is not totally a documentary, the people inside seem unreal, what is strange, since they are real.
It looks like an advertising or a huge joke, or these miracle things we try to sell you in a cheap gossip magazine.
Such a pity! Because the subject is very serious. A little more of restraint would have been welcome.
It is not supposed to be ""abracadabra"" like a TV show with magicians. But it looks like that, while they say so important things!
At the end of this video, I couldn't believe how bad it was made. They wanted to make it spectacular, but it doesn't need to be ""made"" spectacular. The subject is already spectacular enough by itself.

Hence my disappointment, not by the subject, but by the way it was treated.

The Bible covers everything they were talking about.  As I listened to each person there was a scripture that would pop in my mind to back up what they were saying.  Although they didn't mention the bible.  All that they were saying was based on biblical principles. I could have done without the mysterious eerie music though.,1360281600,,495,4.279569892473118

1602927,1,B00005JPJ8,"This film is so poorly researched and is a complete waste of time. So, you can do anything moral or immoral but just really focus on what you want and The Secret, which they are calling the Law of Attraction, will come true for you! Most of this is how you can think yourself into riches. Waste of time. They try to make it look scientific with selective language and people in white coats, a five year old can shoot holes through this stuff. They show a woman in front of a jewelry store lusting after a beautiful necklace, and then applying The Secret she starts to see herself having the necklace. In the next scene a handsome man shows up and is placing that same necklace around her neck all because she trained herself to focus on the necklace coming to her! It is evident one must have goals and visions of what they want in life, this film reduces all the complexities of this wonderful life into creating our own realities by pure mental power and then watching things float to us, mostly material things! I bet the Church of Scientology is behind this film as it has a lot of parallels to some of their dogma. My opinion, a waste of time.",1359504000,,1148,4.344186046511628

Of course this movie is a gimmick to buy their book and DVD, but unfortunately you don't know who these people are in the book (unless you search them) until you watch the DVD. Very well scripted because they say the same thing and get the money from it. Hell, I could call myself a medical doctor/surgeon/PHD PHD PHD and all just to get some piece of the money for bills or whatever.

1602930,2,B00005JPJ8,"This is a misrepresentation of the neurological process that happens in your brain when you focus on something.  There is nothing mystical here.  It's also an exaggeration of results.  Thinking about there being no bullies at work does not make the bullies move to another location, it simply gives the fact that they did move more significance in your mind.

I do know what electricity is and so do most who have studied modern science.  The fact that he would try to use this smoke and mirror show on people who do not understand electricity is a clear sign of deception that should raise a flag to anything else that this video tries to represent.  We also know how this concept works at the very building blocks of our brain.  The fact that this man does not should also be an indication that he's not the person to be listening to on these matters.

Finally, simply thinking things into existence will do very little for you.  By training your mind to seek success,however, your eyes will be open to opportunities that you would have otherwise missed.  Once you see such an opportunity, it is up to you to pounce upon it and master it.

You must work hard, you must persevere midst enormous hurdles, you must not let anything get in the way of your success ... YOU must make things happen for you.  THIS is the real secret.",1359331200,3,1328,4.510460251046025

1602953,2,B00005JPJ8,"A friend and colleague read the book and said it really changed her outlook.  I was hopeful that The Secret would at least be something new.  It's not.  Don't get me wrong, there is value in creating a vision for the future. Envisioning yourself succeeding, ""seeing"" everything down to the detail and tapping into what that successful ""future you"" has to ""say"" are all good practices to help you get where you're going.  But the secret is, ""Its no 'secret'.""

Unfortunately, like most repackaged self-help pseudopsychology/pseudo-metaphysics this puts a fancy wrapper on stuff people were writing about in the 1920s and before.

An interesting question that this psychology fails to answer is ""Why then are so many miserable people successful, and so many successful people miserable?""

1602956,3,B00005JPJ8,"The movie was fairly well put together.  As to the subject: heh. That we create our own reality is not much of a secret. It's not much of a secret that the body is in the mind--but ignorance is just the art of ignoring an inconvenient truth. And why ignore it? Because it really is either very simple or very complicated. Does this mean the old Voo Doo stick pins in dolls actually causes someone somewhere to feel pain? Can you wish someone to death? Have you? Is all the animosity from the countries that hate the USA spelling out our doom (without them having to do anything but imagine it?)  Some will say nobody can do anything to us that we don't invite--well, what if you're just not thinking about it one way or another?  The more fundamental question, perhaps, is what is Me, You, We, etc. Is there anybody else out there? If I were all alone creating my little (seemingly big) reality that could be kinda...well...lonely. And very very responsible--the buck stops here. But I can get around that by giving power to others--now they have some control of my reality. It's less lonely, but it also a little more chaotic. Or are there lots of us stars in the sky that light the same terrain? Is physical reality a hologram, a dream, a matrix, a Sims game? In one mind doing it all, are there many conjoined, or is it just a hall of mirrors?

And another question: what are wants? Who is it or what is it that wants? Are today's wants tomorrow's woes?

I'll agree that thoughts are energy, that every beat of the heart is really an electrical impulse that radiates outward, that we create our own reality. Why not? But ultimately even those concepts are functions of the mechanism that gives them (the apeparance of?) reality.

Happiness seems to be the ultimate goal of the mind. And happiness seems to lie in a lack of want, not in the pursuit of it.

As my sister says, so wisely, ""It just is what it is.""

But after watching this, I came out feeling this is the same rhetoric that's been spewed to us since childhood: ""If you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything."" Yes, there isn't anything new in ""The Secret"" even though the authors try to reinvent the same concept in a different light. What is most disturbing though is the inherent notion that all you have to do is to focus the mind on a target and something magical will happen by the means of the ""laws of attraction"". Yes, by the magical force of the laws of attraction, you will be able to get that which you desire. Now, does that sound rational to you? What is utterly nonsense is that somehow they make it seem scientific by tying this to Quantum Mechanics. On a practical level what the authors preach makes sense, because everyone needs goals in order to achieve them. If you have a goal, you are likely to achieve something, whereas if you have no goal, you will just be wasting your time living day to day. But as the minutes of this video drag on, it seems more and more apparent that it is not talking about anything of practical sense, but something more on a supernatural level. Whether there is truth to the laws of attraction or not cannot be proven or disproved since there can be no direct relational evidence to establish cause and effect in the manner that this video presents. ""The Secret"" seems to be on a more spiritual level than anything else, and has absolutely no basis on any solid facts. ""The Secret"" tries to show plenty of examples of people in dire circumstances overcoming hardships by simply focusing their minds to attract positive results, but goes no further than a few anecdotes from believers in the same school of thought. This leaves me with an opinion that this video is dishonest at best and is almost shown in a way that reminds me of propaganda.

It isn't that I don't like motivational videos, but these videos depict a dishonest truth that I feel feed into a society that is rapidly becoming more and more impatient with achieving goals. Everything has to be now and it has to be easy, and ""The Secret"" is basically telling you what you really want to hear without tell you that hard work is involved in every success story.

If you are looking for magic bullets then by all means check out ""The Secret""; there is no harm in learning about different perspectives. But if you are looking for something more practical and grounded, then I'd recommend the following books:

""Outliers: The Story of Success"" by Malcom Gladwell
""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen R. Covey
""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie

Make up your own minds and accept the real truth: Every success story comes with large hidden amounts of pain staking hard work that can not be overcome by simply ""feeling positive"" or by using ""the laws of attraction"". The real secret is this: Persistence. Likeness attracts might work in the romantic world, but in the real world of physics opposites attract, not the other way around.",1354406400,2,3134,4.5910714285714285

It's not about the stuff, but I love focusing on the good things in life and having an attitude of gratitude.  Sure this can come off as superficial, but it's up to you to dig deeper.

1603256,1,B00005JPJ8,"Since this is little more than a reformulation of Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, I will simply repost my review here.

One of Peale's friends is quoted as saying ""Every day when I wake up I realise I have a choice. I can be happy or unhappy. So what do I do? I'm not dumb. I just CHOOSE to be happy."" What nonsense. I am reminded of a particularly callous sermon I had the misfortune of listening to in Japan back in 2010, where a pampered pastor described the Haiti earthquake victims as happy. If they were so happy, why were they collecting money for them? How someone can live with such blatant mountains of cognitive dissonance is simultaneously disturbing and infuriating.

Peale's friend could easily be shown the error of his ways by someone with more life experience. If I knew someone like that, I would punch him until he realised that happiness is not something that can be ""chosen."" We would not need psychologists, psychiatrists or people willing to listen and help each other if happiness was that simple. NVP tries to strengthen this platitude with another from former US President Lincoln: ""People are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be."" What nonsense. All this shows is that even charismatic leaders can be incredibly shallow at times.

NVP trots out prayer and dependence on Jesus as a solution (when in actual fact, it is the calming of one's mind that actually helps, not the prayer itself). This is nonsense, as numerous prayer studies and the utter dearth of regenerated amputees has already demonstrated.

If you want your life to improve, go out there and do something to make things better. Don't expect this travesty of a book or wishful thinking to do it for you.",1353369600,,1735,4.678688524590164

1603258,1,B00005JPJ8,"This is about making you believe that thinking positively makes things around you mystically bring what you are thinking about.

Scientifically, you recall the things you focus on more vividly and readily than things you don't focus on. Because you would recall the things you focus on while your brain is moving information from short to long term memory. This makes sense.

Example, if you think you will never get a job, every time you get a rejection letter for your resume you remember it as more evidence to support your theory and ignore the one job offer you do get as a fluke. We know very few people get every single job they apply for and the average job search takes 9-10 months for someone submitting resume's daily. Knowing this, the three months you spent on unemployment submitting 3 resumes a week as minimum doesn't sound so bad.

For someone thinking positively, you purposefully ignore those negative signs and relish in the positive of getting the job.

I gave this a 1 star because I hate being lied to and marketed to. I can see how someone who is of below average intelligence or someone who is reaching for something to believe in would take it to heart and live happily thinking positively while not knowing they've just been trained like a dog.

I was in a mental ""funk"" and quite honestly lost in general life direction. I embraced the thought ""whether you think you can or cannot, you are right"" and began to visualize what I wanted. Things in my life changed in a way that those beliefs that I had, began to emerge in my life.

1603418,1,B00005JPJ8,"I am surprised that this book/movie took off as it has - there are much better sources of self-help material regarding the power of positive thinking or Law of Attraction, as it is often now called.  Those involved in this movie are shameless in trying to make a science of their approach, without any sensible foundation.

This movie is bunk - could barely stomach watching it when friends held a movie night featuring The Secret a few years ago.  I enjoy some of the older writings on positive thinking, but my takeaway - and my life experience with this subject matter to date - is that positive thinking/LOA is useful self-help material if you focus on the psychological and emotional pros of positive thinking.  Namely, I have experienced my life anew as a result of changing my perspective, my attitude, my inner talk, my level of optimism.  In this way, you do sort of have the power to attract good to you, because we often focus only on the negative and never even notice the good.  When we have a more positive outlook, all of a sudden, we see blessings worth counting, and the benefit of this [ability to see some positives in a rough patch] in life can be invaluable.

Life is what it is, good and bad, and when you are worn down mentally and emotionally (fretful and pessimistic), you get much less out of life and things become much harder to bear.  Positive thinking and a recognition and respect for how much your attitude and perspective impacts your ""reality"" is an important lesson in life.  And it takes most of us a while - if ever - to learn this.  I have gotten a better hand on this over the past 5 or so years and I have dealt with significant circumstances much better than I would have in years prior (including health, job and family/relationship setbacks).

Wild dreaming does not form the world or your life - it simply doesn't.  It's silly to believe otherwise.  However, there are lessons to be learned - much harder lessons - much more valuable lessons, as I described above, but The Secret won't get you there...

In sum, the way we think about and view challenges and circumstances can make the world of difference.  BUT people are not as interested in that lesson, because it doesn't seem to get them anywhere or change anything, but it really does.  Plus it builds strength and character to get through this journey we call life.  Getting hopped up on The Secret's easy come la la land approach might be attractive at a glance, but it's worthless.  It's also not much use from a self-help perspective if the answer to hardship is that you attracted it.  Really now?",1346976000,2,2602,4.568965517241379

I would recommend watching the film several time to a get a good grasp of its message.

However, I believe there's one very important thing this film is missing which is how to get rid of the emotional baggage that is causing the negative thoughts.

Oh we can change things and make things come to us.  Yeah, I guess you can.  Maybe, if you work hard and get a bit lucky, then you can achieve your dreams.  But this book doesn't really tell you how to do that, it just offers some pseudoscientific nonsense about how to do it.  It offers people false hope.  A starving child in Nigeria couldn't use this method to get food.  Why should you be able to use it to get a leg up in life?",1343692800,,571,4.072072072072072
1603489,2,B00005JPJ8,"Believe and you shall receive. Only they don't ever tell you in what. They say there is a scientific explanation for how the Law Of Attraction works, yet they never give it. Attraction works in magnets because of specific physical properties. And yet, I've never seen any documented evidence that human thought is somehow able to reproduce those properties. And even in magnets, only metallic objects are attracted.  The Secret claims that we can attract luck and fortune, concepts which have no tangible manifestation in the physical world, and thus, cannot possibly be bound by any rules of magnetism.

The movie has some ""mini-stories"" that show the concept of Attraction at work. A kid wants a bicycle. He staples a picture of it on his refrigerator, he goes out to walk every day thinking of the bicycle. One day, Boom! His dad buys him the bicycle. Like magic. Never is the child seen actually working to earn money for his bicycle, nor is he seen doing anything towards the goal, other than wishing for it. We all know that life simply doesn't work that way. I've known people who've dreamed of owning their own business their whole lives, yet have done nothing to actually have one. Guess what? They still don't own one.

In another mini story, a man is seen opening his mailbox, dreading to find it full of bills. Effectively, he finds bills. However, once he's learned the Secret, he is again seen opening his mailbox, and he receives a check instead of bills. He effectively blocked all his bills by force of thought alone. Which means he probably gets free water, electricity and phone service. In reality, if you own a house and have these basic services, you will eventually receive a bill for them. No amount of wishful thinking can change that.

The movie's message should be interpreted as: keeping a positive attitude.  Thinking you can do something is actually the first step toward doing it. But it doesn't stop there, you actually have to work for it. This is the part the movie neglects to mention, and will likely confuse many and downright fool the gullible.",1343001600,,2082,4.756232686980609

More than silly, it becomes dangerous when we consider that this movie's premise basically says if someone experience something bad, it's their own fault. Consider how that conversation will go with a 10 year old battling cancer, or with a friend who's spouse dies in a car accident.

I think it leaves many people with the idea that all they have to do is think of something and its theirs. Which is partly true but some people I know saw it and thought they didn't have to put any work into getting what they wanted. They thought if they imagined hard enough for that new car it would somehow get to them with no other effort or work. Or if they thought hard for a new job but never filled out applications that they would somehow get a call one day. I don't think everyone who sees this thinks that way but I can see where if someone is no familiar with the law of attraction they could be mislead.,1341964800,,770,4.072368421052632

1603604,1,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD was made in 2006, before the economy tanked.  I do wonder what the focus would be if it were made now.  I wonder if Jack Canfield would say, ""I live in a comfortable home with a woman I love, and I find my life so rewarding because I can help so many people,"" instead of, ""I live in a $4.5million home, have a wife to die for, and I get to travel, blah, blah, blah.""  How about we imagine a just world where everyone gets what they need, where suffering is minimal.  We would have clean air and water, and no one would go hungry.

The truth is, with the huge human population, there really are limited resources.  They become more limited when a small percentage of the population has most of the money and control over most of those resources.  You're right, Bob Proctor, it isn't a coincidence that 1% of the population has most of the wealth.  I disagree with you as to why it's not a coincidence.  I think greed and lack of compassion play a big part.  Why should someone have a huge $4.5 million home when people are starving, the earth is heating up, and the oceans are dying?!

Though there may be some truth to the general concept of The Secret, the focus of this particular DVD is way too superficial with the problems we face.  There is too much trying to appeal to people's materialistic, wasteful tendencies.  This topic is no longer relevant, though I did agree with the guy who talked about pets.

My mom used to have this wall hanging that read, ""Pray to God but row to shore.""  I think there is actually more basic truth to this folksy saying than there is in The Secret.",1339804800,,1596,4.308724832214765

1603606,4,B00005JPJ8,"I absolutely believe in the theory behind this.  We are all one and we are all made from energy.  Energy is not a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing, it becomes whatever you direct it into.  In terms of sailing, energy would be the wind and our thoughts/feelings, the sails and the direction they're turned.

I am a little sad by the way this movie presented this information though because the skeptics appear to be feeding on that and dismissing the whole concept entirely.  I don't believe it's any sort of genie and magical lamp concept, it's certainly not a ""get rich quick scheme"" and the guy talking about his parking spaces should've been edited out entirely...that's incredibly far off from the message.  Also the emphasis on amplifying material possessions and financial gains was a shady attempt to make cash by baiting in confused Americans who still think that's what will bring them happiness.  So, overall the hokey-ness probably drowned some of the depth of the message.  Also, it completely left out the part of WORK.  You have to put sustained amounts of effort into getting what you want.  If you took this movie literally and wanted 6-pack abs, you'd be waiting a LONG time to get those if you didn't get your butt off the couch and get busy with sit-ups and a diet.  As someone who has lost 50lbs in 6 months though, I can tell you that visualizing is very important, but you have to get out of your comfort zone and work....no genie in the lamp people, sorry. lol

But that was my harsh judgements and why I demoted it to 4 stars.  Otherwise, this is absolutely what I needed and absolutely the day I needed it.  It is everything I already knew deep down but I didn't know how to understand effectively.  You should never let your mind go on auto-pilot through life, it can drive you into great depression and anger if it's not kept in check.  There is great power in you, and if you're not directing it, who knows where you'll end up; just as a sailor on the ocean would if they didn't adjust their sails.",1339632000,,2015,4.509641873278237

1603611,1,B00005JPJ8,"Silly, juvenile ""spirituality."" This really does not hold up to simple scrutiny.

Let's, for instance, use these ideas on Jews and Germans in the 1940's. If the concepts in this movie and book, called ""The Law of Attraction"", were true...
1) Jewish people in Germany thought negative thoughts about being imprisoned and killed systematically in gas chambers.
2) These fears brought on the Holocaust.
3) In order to end the Holocaust (by which I mean the systematic slaughter of Jewish people), all that any single Jewish person would need to do is change their mind.

""The Secret"" and a lot of ""New Age"" thought in general trivializes what it really takes to live a spiritual life. A Book like Victor Frankl's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-s-Search-for-Meaning/dp/0807014273/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man's Search for Meaning</a>&nbsp;illustrates the true grit it takes to maintain spiritual grace and ease in the face of the Holocaust.

Another example: Consider the resolve it took for Gandhi and his followers to send wave after wave of unarmed men to get beaten by British troops. That took discipline. Communicating that non-violent vision to his followers. And having his followers follow him as he flew, unarmed, into to eye of the storm.

Of course, if he'd have read ""The Secret,"" he could just transmit vibes to the universe. And India would be free. Poppy-cock.

Which leads me to an inescapable conclusion that true spirituality takes work. And is not particularly concerned with riches. For, if that were the case, Gandhi would have declared himself Emperor. And both Jesus and the Buddha would have sat at the helm of early trading conglomerates. Instead of being sought after, riches and ease are seen by the great spiritual leaders as temptations. These leaders rejected wealth, preferring lives of humble poverty.",1338854400,,1880,5.446735395189004

1603643,1,B00005JPJ8,"This isn't a secret, many people know about the laws of attraction. I mean we learn about it when dating, if you are happy and you want someone, then you have a higher chance of getting it, compared to not really trying to go after it or believing you won't be with that person. It was a good video, don't get me wrong. I had to turn it off though, right after I heard the guy talk about how he would imagine getting a front parking spot and it would be there, because he would think about it. Sorry, but no. Laws of attraction do not work with getting a parking spot that someone else has, that is chance. Yes you can wait forever to get the parking spot, but that is not what we are talking about, we are talking about thinking about getting a great parking spot, and it either being there, or having to wait 1-2 minutes for that spot. The universe has no control over that person and telling them you want their spot, that is just bogus. So for bogus claims like that to be put in the video, I had to turn it off. If it makes others feel good, and helps them accomplish more in their life, then good for them and I'm glad they found something to help them push themselves farther in life. I on the other hand don't need someone to lie to me about how the laws of attraction work, so I choose to keep doing what I'm doing, and be happy, push for what I want, and believe I will get what I want.

That aside, I feel obligated to share that I think that this is a total load of garbage.  I am a pretty successful person.  I'm not Steve Jobs successful, but I do very well both in business and in my personal life.  I work in a consulting field where I see a lot of businesses, a lot of people, and I feel qualified to comment on this subject.  The reasons which I see people being succesful in their lives are usually what you would expect:  hard work, above average intelligence, integrity, an appropriate attitude, dedication, etc.  I can't go any farther than that because the formula for success is so different based on the situation.  What makes a professional athelete doesn't necessarily work for a General in the miltary and what works for the General may not work for the VP of Marketing at a retail chain of yogurt shops.

My best advise is to find the people who you feel are successful in your field, get to know them, and mimic their traits until you learn to do it your own way.  If you have a rock star performer who seems to also be hyper organized then maybe that's an indicator.  If everyone seems to like them then perhaps relationships are a key criteria for success in their world.  Don't read too much into movies like this one which boil everything down to a state of mind and imply that if you just concentrate on the right things then the world around you molds to your will.  The truth is that the people involved in this industry are not usually motivated to help you ... they're motivated to sell you a book, a seminar, a video, etc.",1336262400,2,1653,4.415841584158416

Think about that... If we reason a bit and apply that same line of logic, then when a woman gets raped the line of reasoning in the video implies it would be her fault for attracting this behavior to her. If someone gets murdered was it because they attracted the murderer? Really? That's your theory on life, the universe and everything? To blame the victim? Really?

Like any motivational video, I believe whatever you get out of it is mostly subject to your own interpretations.  You kind of have to choose the message you want to take from this one.  There are a lot of experts with various talking points who do flash their degrees and titles around.  They offer various opinions.  I think you can either get distracted by the bad parts or filter out the wacky stuff and try to distill the parts that are good.

POSITIVES:
* Good message - Believing in a positive outcome is more likely to make it happen.
* Lots of examples from a variety of sources -  maybe too many sources, should have picked out the bad ones from the good
* Experts try to explain things in multiple different ways from their own perspectives

NEGATIVES:
* Cheesey video quality - background visuals were a little distracting, like the bowl of hovering chicken soup over JC's head
* Creepy voice over - did not like the whispering low voice made it sound like a horror movie transition
* Some experts are actually quacks (See wiki article on James Arthur Ray)
* Historical inaccuracies
  - Ex. Don't know if you want to use Abraham Lincoln as an example since he was disliked in his time & also suffered many
  personal tragedies, like the loss of all of his sons, & not to mention being shot in the head. Suffered melancoly
  (AKA CLINICAL DEPRESSION)
  - Winston Churchill had a really unhappy childhood, lots of personal tragedy, sure he is seen as a great leader
  but he is famous for also having CHRONIC depression. (So doesn't that kind of also go against the Secret?)
* Failure to produce a counter argument
  - Ex. like what about the Starving people in Sudan?  Did they just have too many negative thoughts?
  - What about people who are the product of incest?
* Should have toned down the statement a little
* Could have shortened this video and had less blackout / transition quotes

If I were to re-do the video, I would do a thorough pre-screening of whom I would allow to speak and represent the secret. I would pick only people who had no criminal history, who had appropriate accreditation. There were too many metaphysicists here. Also, too many physicists. I would pick maybe 1 from every category.  They should all speak on how they were qualified to speak about ""the secret"" first.

It's ongoing, and a good deal of it is more involved than self-absorbed positive thinking.

Every time you achieve something related to this goal you're reminded of the object of your goal and subconsciously aligned yourself towards your goal and then you not so magically arrive at the target you've been subconsciously been aiming for all these months, years, decades. Now that this object of your desires has seemingly landed on your lap, there's no other explanation that could possibly make since except that the cosmos are in fact smitten with you and have no other purpose of greater importance than fulfilling your every hapless whim.

About 5 minutes in, I thought it was a great intro for a parody or thought experiment piece where the film maker would at some point reveal how easy it is for your mind to be manipulated to believe in basically anything, though the use of dramatic music, quotations, and an unending stream of testimonies from experts with official sounding credentials such as ""philosopher"", ""book writer"", etc.

Well 30 minutes in and still nothing yet. So I was thinking... ok, they want to showcase ""brain washing"" techniques where if the same things are repeated over and over again... they become ""truths"". I was still expecting at the end of the video, they would reveal all of this to the viewers. I fast forwarded to the last 5 minutes and then it slowly dawned to me... this was not a parody or a thought-experiement. They were being serious all along!

Magical thinking will leave you with nothing but regret from wasting time imagining attraction instead of actually doing something.

I always Hope things will get better and they will Change forever but wishful thinking really? The world isn't candy canes and lollypops kids.

This movie at its core is an attempt to tell people that the truly successful people think that they are already successful. But they really skim over it all. I couldn't watch all of it because it irritated me so much, however the 25 minutes that I did watch taught me nothing. Anyone who has grown out of their teenage years and started toward a path of business already knows most of what the ""secret"" is.

He claims that the power of positive thinking allowed him to have the things that everyone wants.  He did not say a fulfilling life, or a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world, or even richer, more nourishing relationships with friends, family and partners.  No, he merely said that his accomplishments were having a 4.5 million dollar home, a ""to die for wife""... clearly a trophy, and being able to vacation in all the hot spots that everybody wants to go to.  Others mentioned creating boards with words and pictures posted on them of things you want to achieve.  Lovely idea, except they were all posting pictures of mansions and cars.  An artist was told to paint the things he wanted in his life, and since he wanted to date three women a week, he painted himself amongst three women.

1604127,1,B00005JPJ8,"You have to hand it to Rhonda Byrne: she knows how to exploit the essentially vacuous idea at the heart of this successful brand-creation exercise for all it's worth.

This DVD is a further extension of the well-worn brand, with its now globally established motif of `the Secret' in archaic-looking white font superimposed over red wax-seal image. The tag-line states: ""The Secret has travelled through centuries - to reach you"" so reinforcing the deception that the content is somehow arcane and ancient, and by buying it you're gaining entry into a special group jealously guarding some great knowledge unavailable to ordinary mortals.

The content is more of the same-old-same-old. A slickly-presented series of sound bites from a bunch of folks claimed to be successful in their chosen fields (e.g. ""philosopher"", ""visionary"" etc.) celebrity-endorse the product: how the ""power of positive thinking"" will make you rich, healthy, slim and popular. As usual it's targeted directly at a sharply-defined market segment addicted to `self-awareness' and `self-improvement' programs.

The narrative is structured to imply that a fairly ordinary and universally understood tool of motivational psychology is something divinely mysterious: positive thinking IS important in life and in any business venture, but there ain't nothing holy or arcane about it, and there ain't no ""natural law"" working here. As in Byrne's original book and its multiple brand-extensions, unsupported and un-falsifiable claims are once again dressed up as ""the great secret of the ages"" but the slick advertising industry-standard editing fails to conceal the pseudoscience and hokum which these guys manage to deliver with straight faces and no hint of embarrassment!

The great P T Barnum observed ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Byrne and her fellow marketeers are to be congratulated on the success of their clever business idea, the exploitation of which exhibits detailed marketing planning and thoroughness of professional execution. Highly skilled brand management strategies are in evidence, so it's unlikely they themselves are nave enough to believe that all they need to do is ""believe in the power of positive thinking"" to make the money roll in: they are clearly far more professional (and ruthless?) than that.

If this floats your boat and `transforms your life' I wish you well. But really, you don't need this scam: these guys have already made millions from it. Here's an idea: donate to a charitable cause instead.",1328400000,,2513,5.3842239185750635

When I first saw it I was literally blown away, realizing I had attracted a lot of these negative circumstances.  It boiled down to the understanding that these things were not ""meant to be"" and I was holding on to things that were not within my best interest.

Since then I have turned this movie on to at least 20 people, many of which have applied and love the message it presents in a very clever documentary-style movie, yet with some skits and real people instead of star-struck celebrities.

Im not gonna lie to you though its sum mental and emotional work your gonna have to do to apply the secret.  It takes more then just wishing on a star.  You much study, put the mental work in, change your outlook on life, apply positive feedback to every occurance no matter how bad or indifferent, and give back to the community and others.  Not just family and friends but people u may not even know.  And always always give thanks and be grateful for everything in your life!  I would suggest buying the power which is another book by rhonda burne.  It ties everything together.  Things she didn't mention in the movie the secret she was able to get into with the power.

There are many things in this world that can help with your spirtual sense, but when you see it in action with the people that believe in the Secret you can tell that they have overcome all the down trodden emotions that people experience everyday.

While I agree that there is power in positive thinking, it is ridiculous to think that everything you have (or don't have) in life is the result of your thoughts.  An abused child was not abused becuase they had negative thoughts.  People don't die becuase they walk around with negative thoughts.  And to say that people have success because they imagine it is equally ridiculous.  People are successful becuase they work hard.  Your doctor didn't become a doctor by imagining what it would be like to cut people open.  I don't think you would want to go to him/her if their success was built on that!  They worked hard.  That's the secret to succes.  It helps to motivate you if you have a positive attitude, but things don't fall in your lap becuase of it.

Several years ago somebody recommended the DVD of The Secret to me so i went with it and, after watching it, felt totally inspired, so much so I handed my notice in at work to develop myself.

A couple of years later and the biggest change was in my mind and mental outlook on life. The Secret set me on a journey of discovering the original new thought authors from late 1800's and slowly, but surely, I have seen changes. Last year I discovered two authors and everything clicked into place, namely Neville Goddard and Joanne St. Clair. These authors really heightened the journey of discovery which The Secret set me on, resulting in a six figure lottery win earlier this year.

I would definately recommend this book and the DVD, but just sticking to this and nothing else is not enough. If you really want change you must keep discovering your inner Spirit and its relationships to life. Neville taught me more about the imagination and its use, and Joanne St. Clair put it all into perspective in a very modern and down to earth way.

1604499,4,B00005JPJ8,"Most of you have probably heard of the secret or heard of the law of attraction.

The Law of Attraction
At its core it says thoughts attract.
It builds upon the old saying ""Thoughts become things"" or as the Buddha said it ""With our thoughts, we make the world"".

You have probably seen this happen without reflecting on it.
Maybe you have been thinking about something you have wanted for a long time, you feel it with a very strong emotion and then out of nowhere someone gives you it as a present.
Or you could be thinking about a friend and all of a sudden the phone rings or someone starts talking to you about that old friend.

For me the strongest experience I have had with the Law of Attraction was when I met my wife.
I had been without a girlfriend for a long time and really wanted one. I had spoken to my friends about it but not really done anything to rectify the situation.

On a Monday though I made my decision and told them that by next Tuesday I would have a girlfriend. They asked me how I planned to accomplish that and I told them that I had no idea.

The weekend went and nothing happened.
Monday I had a baseball game and there she was. She was a friend of one of my teammates and we started talking and became a couple the next day, I had made a wish and all of a sudden it became reality.

I believe The Law of Attraction is both true and false
Let me explain;
The Law of Attraction says that which you dwell upon will become your reality - this I believe.
It says you will get what you dwell upon because the universe will re-arrange itself to make your dreams reality - I do not believe this.

Instead I believe that if you believe in the Law of Attraction and follow its rules you will take more responsibility, you will be more positive, you will take more action and you will constantly be thinking about your goals and how to achieve them, you will also activate the Subconscious mind which will work tirelessly to bring you those brilliant flashes of insight you need to complete you goals.

If you keep in mind that you are attracting situations into your life, based on what you think about most of the time, you will stop thinking about the negative, you will focus on the positive and you will do everything in your power to bring you goals into your reality.

When you start following The Law of Attraction you start to take responsibility for your life, you start to understand that someone else won't and can't bring you your goals, it is up to you. You can attract the opportunities you want, you can take the actions necessary, and you can make the whole difference.

How this ties into the story about my wife
In many ways it seemed as though fait had brought us together that day. She hadn't spoken to my teammate for about 3 years, she missed her train and didn't know how to get to the field, luckily my teammate's father drove back and picked her up and to top it off, she had just broken up with her ex.

I in turn almost missed the game myself.

But this kind of chance meets happen all the time, the difference was that this time I decided to take action. I decided to talk to her and let myself crash and burn if it happened.
Because I had set that goal and made that commitment I had more courage and I took more action.

Whether you believe it or not it is worth respecting
The Secret has spawned a whole line of personal development writing and research, people have achieved and experienced amazing things thanks to it.

Living by the law lets you take control over your life, be more confident and in the end happier, which is the most important thing.

If you haven't seen The Secret or read the Book I must implore you to do so, whether you then chose to believe or not, the lessons you will learn make the small investment of time and money more than worth it.",1316995200,2,3819,4.270083102493075

Ester appears in the original channelling 'Abraham' and talking about 'The Law of Attraction'.  Because of contract problems Ester was edited out of the later version.  The later version 'lost' the original feel and intent of the message that the story and lesson was trying to tell.

I bought a copy 2 weeks ago from this Amazon page that was supposed to have Ester in it, but it didn't.  BE CAREFUL when ordering!  The barcode of the original is 094922579959.  The second version without Ester is 094922638960.  Also on the back of the second versions are 'EXTENDED VERSION' and [...]

I hope that the sellers realize what they are selling because there is NO comparison between the original version and the second version.

I found it interesting with the author of chicken soup for the soul talking about how he lives in a 4 million dollar home and travels anywhere he desires and how wonderful his life is while he was pumping his book in the back ground with chickens on the back drop (subliminal advertising 101).

So really bad things that happen to good people are a result of their negative thinking?  This is dangerous thinking being presented as it places blame on victims.  Take it in stride and not to the point of I can be a millionaire if I close my heals and click three times.

1604506,1,B00005JPJ8,"You know, there is a pastor who recently and briefly discussed this book and guffawed it as much as I am about to. Seriously, folks, we need to be cautious about what is written (even what I am writing--test it and see it what I am about to say lines up with what you may have been taught, what you know to be so, what is true, etc, etc...---- anyway, there is NO secret. How's that. The only way that I know that works and that is true is seeking Christ in the Holy Bible. No, I am not preaching, but some may interpret it that way. Tell you what, unless you feel so threatened and so imprisoned for what I am about to say, please do not continue.

That being written, for the more mature persons here, I am going to simply put it out there. Try God, Try Jesus, and Try the Holy Spirit. They are caaling on each of you every day. They call out to your Spirit every single day. "" Many are called, few are chosen..."" The Holy Bible is Free in many churches. Visit a church who preaches about the New Testament, about The Good News and the messages and promises that Christ left for ALL of us. Church is not for ""good"" people. Church is a body of members who are called by Christ, who believes in Him, who has a relationship (not religion-""ship""...a RELATIONSHIP..with Him. You really can't lose.

This is not about other religions, nor is it to debate about them. I am speaking of THIS personal relationship. It really is too awesome to pass up. I would not place myself in public to say this if it weren't so. This ""Secret"" book is not going to lead you where you need to go, or where you believe that you are being called to find out. There are secrets, but not in this particular book. This book and the adverstisements suggests that you are idiots and you have no idea about your own experiences. However, there is ONE who truly does know , detail for detail.

 For the mature ones, we have come to realize that something is missing in our lives (we're not talking about your spouse, or cars, houses, or those things--which are needed, but are just not the final analysis of our existence. None of these things are any good nor will last with out knowing Christ (because HE really can sustain what you already have and remove what you do not need and much, much more. No one human being can ever tell you this. Receive your relationship with Him and find out the truth. The truth is that this is no secret.

This is very real, this is not about Santa Clause, or the Easter Bunny or none of that commercial falsehood. A RELATIONSHIP with Christ is Spiritually discerned and most nay sayers will crone about every argument under the moon. I am not here to argue (as there is a scripture about arguing with fools. It is all up to you. Personally, I would not sneeze at it ...but for those with the ""ah-choo!!"" sense of humour, you can't say that I didn't tell you. The problem with every one (yes, NONE of us are exempt no matter how great you have it...) is that we all have fallen short and we need to be loved (not in the demonstration seen in movies or heard in sexual love songs..I am talking, REAL LOVE, REAL FORGIVENESS and Real TRUTH. No, your life will not be perfect when you accept Christ, but for me, it is BETTER with Christ.

The world is too dark NOT to get to know Christ. There is NO secret, except for the author's salary for this book and the intent for which this book was written. Look at the reviews from others and see why they are so disgusted. People are seeking truth (I hope), people are seeking peace despite the condition of our world, it can be had, but it isn't easy and it wasn't easy for Christ either.

I will end it on this note, the rest is truly up to you, but I encourage it (try a non-denominational church) and you will come to know what real love is and why this world is going through a severe deficit of it. Be sure to discern the kind of gathering which is only about the Word of God in truth and real love. He is the author of Love and of Peace and not in the way that you may have known it. You'll know, when you receive Him. I hope you will, and when you do, I can stake on this one myself (and this is a BOLD comment) you will NOT be disappointed. And if you are, you haven't met HIM yet.",1314316800,,4236,4.196560196560196

1604634,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've owned the original DVD since it basically came out.  The original one (with Jerry and Esther Hicks) is the ONE to get.  I've not read all the reviews (good and bad), but for me, a 48 year-old wife and mom, it has resonated to my heart.  I used to try to share the joy and clarity that these teachings brought to me, but my sharing was not generally received with enthusiasm.  Most of the ""critics"" that I shared this movie with (the teachings), were people who think inside the box, can't see further than their own noses, and have generally resigned themselves to being ""victims"" in life.  Furthermore, ALL of them have a lack conscience about them, think the teachings are about ""money"" (God forbid!!!), and ignore the real message of the DVD/teachings.  I've come to the conclusion that life is indeed short...and the only responsibility any of us have is towards ourself - there is no one to change besides yourself if that's what you are looking to do.  The saying, ""When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"" is very much true...and this DVD adheres to that principal.

There are times that I fall out of alignment with joy because I get too immersed with what the world thinks, our culture thinks, etc., and I fall prey to the petty distractions of life and I need to go back and re-watch this.

This DVD is an introductory overview of Law of Attraction and I've found myself attracted to particular teachers in this movie, namely Esther and Jerry Hicks (Abraham-Hicks) and Dr. Michael Beckwith.  They resonate the most with me and my heart.  Bottom line is that this movie/DVD will do good for you if you're looking for good.  If you want to be a negative, whiney, complainer who thinks that everyone else is to blame for all the things wrong in your life, this movie will probably make you angry because I've found out that professional victims do not enjoy self-accountability or self-responsibility.  It's easier to blame someone else than to look at the person in the mirror who actually has more control than they realize.  Also, some people, (I'm come to the conclusion) think that life should be all about pain and suffering, deprivation, and that ""rewards"" come later (heaven, for example).  If you are such a person, who thinks that life should be one huge suck-fest, then this DVD might also be upsetting.  Be warned that the teachers speak often of the ""universe"" as the higher power, instead of always saying, ""God"" (even though they make it VERY clear that whatever you wish to call that higher power is fine); to some, this is blasphemy.  Basically, there's everything right with this movie except for those who wish to find some artificial made-up fault in it.  The most disconcerting thing is that there's people making comments on this movie without having even watched it!!!  I will leave my review with a positive remark, and that is to watch this movie and ""feel"" how it resonates with you.

1604712,1,B00005JPJ8,"1.0  The Theoretical Framework:  Personally Manipulating the Cosmic Delivery  System Through the Law of Attraction

The basic idea is that you thoughts have causal efficacy--they engage the universe by means of THE LAW OF ATTRACTION.  This law, as advocates of The Secret understand it, appears to be a hybrid of Newtonian gravitational attraction and magnetism.  The basic idea is this:  You can make things happen in the universe because you have a mind, one you can use to think thoughts--cognitions.  (For the sake of economy, when explaining what advocates of The Secret believe, I will just say `The Secret says/holds/asserts ...'.)  The Secret says that the primary field of causation--the level at which events are generated--is ultimately mental: anything that happens in the cosmos is initiated by the mind.  The Secret does not deny material reality; they are not `idealists'.  Rather they say that the mind--someone's mind, yours or mine--is the primary cause of what goes down in the cosmos.

Your thoughts have special physical properties that endow them with causal efficacy:

a) Thoughts are magnetic; they attract things, ones that are ""like"" the content of the thoughts; so if you think bad thoughts you get `bad' life-events or situations.  Why should your thought attract anything outside the mind that thinks them?  Answer:
b) Thoughts emit a frequency, which is as physical and real as the frequency of a radio, only much more powerful (it is claimed).
c) The frequency of your thoughts is transmitted to the cosmos--a faceless impersonal entity that acts as the delivery system--the agent of your life-events--one that you can learn to mentally manipulate to get what you want out of life.
d) This impersonal cosmic entity is nevertheless ""smart enough"" to decode the frequency of your thoughts and to understand your thoughts well enough to determine (like Santa) whether you will get good or bad life-events.  If the content of your thoughts is `good', then, since ""like attracts like,"" you get `good' situations; if the content of your thoughts are `bad', well, then head for cover.

So it's no wonder advocates of The Secret place huge emphasis on thought control and cognitive or mental visualization.  And in modern empirical psychology, for instance, in sociocognitive theory, much emphasis is placed on the functional value of thought control.  By `functional value' I mean that the skills of thought control can be used by people to better cope with the difficulties and challenges of their lives.  But thought control is part of a larger set of self-regulatory skills that you need in order to cope successfully with your internal and external environment.

If, for instance, I want to stop feeling so anxious when I drive on congested freeways (say, in LA), then the answer is to acquire the relevant driving skills in order to better cope with the demands of this situation.  But the attempt to lather up internal self-belief in your driving abilities without supplementing this cognitive simulation (if that's what it amounts to), is resorting to mere wishful thinking, not proactive, action-positive, control over your environment.

II.  Why You Should Not Internalize The Secret:  Increased Anxiety, Self-Blame, and the Disengagement of Your Practical Reasoning

Serious problems with internalizing (= believing) The Secret and using it as a guide for how to run your life:

1) Internalizing The Secret can actually inhibit effective action by inhibiting the exercise of one's practical (= means-to-end) reasoning.  Since, according to The Secret, if you concern yourself with ""the how"" of your goals--that is, the means by which to realize them--then you are displaying a lack of faith; what's more, in displaying a lack of faith, you are producing thoughts about what you don't have--negative thoughts--which in turn will activate the cosmic processes that ensure you will continue to lack whatever it is that you lack.  So, The Secret, in effect encourages people to shut down their effective uses of practical means-end intelligence--a key cognitive ability that allows people to successfully adapt to and engage with their environment and thereby to exercise some personal control over the course of their lives.

The Secret encourages a misguided and misguiding ""subjectivism""--misguided because it is not empirically sound.  There is no physical law of attraction that works in the way they say.  You will not find it in eminent physicist Sir Roger Penrose's huge book listing all the known laws of physics.  Second, The Secret is misguiding because it doesn't work.  Changing your construal of a situation--say, from one where you are the victim to one where you are capable of exercising some influence in that situation--can make a WORLD of difference; however, the real changes that take place in your life as a consequence of your change in attitude are very often due to  behavioral changes made as a result of your change in attitude.  And these changes in your behavior produce real effects in a complex environment, which, reciprocally, affects you.  So it is a reciprocal causal structure between three things:

a) you, the person, and your cognitive responses, perceptions, feelings;
b) your behaviour
c) the imponderably complex environment, both social and natural

All these things interact reciprocally.  But The Secret seems to operate on a simplistic conceptual framework:

a) you, and your mind (and your ""feeling good or bad"")
b) the law of attraction (engaged by your thoughts)
c) the cosmos and its deliver system (serving you up good/bad life-events depending on whether you've been naughty or nice in your thoughts)

Do you really believe this is how the universe works?  In order to exercise influence over your life, you are encouraged to exercise control along ONE dimension--the mental dimension.  Your mental life controls EVERYTHING that happens--or could happen--to you.  Granted, making a change of attitude can make very significant changes in your life.  Real changes.  But intra-personal change is not necessarily inter-personal change.  In order to change your life for the better, you must exercise control over your thought life (a claim most people would acknowledge as true), but advocates of The Secret seem to be asserting something stronger.  They hold that the exercise of thought control (thinking only good thoughts) is also SUFFICIENT for altering your life-situation.  This is obviously false, but the folks advocating The Secret have to do some fancy ad hoc footwork in order to dispel the obviousness of the error.

2) Here's an example.  If you do not experience positive life-events immediately upon regulating your thoughts in the direction of the good, then--guess what?--IT'S YOUR FAULT.  You're not believing hard enough; you're not feeling good intensely enough.  You're simply not feeling it with enough oomph or gusto to engage the law of attraction to ensure the cosmic delivery of the corresponding life-event.  Nice.  This is, in effect, a recipe for anxiety and, in addition, chronic self-blame, isn't it?  And it is totally unnecessary and ill-conceived, since we, as human beings, do not exist in a causal vacuum.  We are embedded natural organisms--special, yes, in that we have cognitive capabilities (the capacity to reflect on our goals and our functioning and to use our power of reason to decide how best to live, for instance).  As human beings, we are embedded in our environments (social and natural) and that means that NOT EVERYTHING IS UNDER OUR CONTROL.

3) We live in a natural environment--where tsunamis occur and people die, where even very rich people get sick (Michael J Fox, Michael Douglass), as well as a social environment in which people have varied goals and ends, many of which conflict; in many cases, your personal victory means someone else has to lose (e.g., getting that university position).  The environment is an imponderably complex entity, a network of personal agents in pursuit of their varied and conflicting objectives.  Cooperation does happen--often.  And when it does, it usually requires some interpersonal skills, shared objectives and values, not merely solitary wishing or intense introspection on what one wants, however positive it may be.  You have to actually talk to persons and know how to communicate with them to get what you want, and that requires the skills of self-assertion, empathy, bilateral negotiation, persuasion, etc.  These are skills that have to be learned through experience.

I think that the good people of The Secret (and they seem to be sensitive, well-meaning people, but I may be wrong) are not acknowledging how, in changing your attitude and construal of a situation--say, from one in which you view  yourself as a victim to instead viewing yourself as a personal agent--you exercise influence over your motivation and, consequently, your behavior.  When you change your behavior, changes are thereby made in your environment.  These alterations in the environment originate in you, the agent, and, are, in many cases the direct effects of your own action on the environment.  There is no need to suppose the cosmos stepped on your behalf in to bring about the event.  Because you did it.  It's called PERSONAL AGENCY.  Some changes in your environment cannot occur without the help of others.  But you can influence others for the sake of your own valued goals.  Why is it necessary (and how does it empower us personally?) to view our dealings with the world as the result of our manipulation of some cosmic life-event delivery system via our thought alone?

4) Using your feelings as a radar screen.  What is wrong with listening to your emotions in order to know what you are thinking? Cognitive psychology is one of the most significant advances in modern empirical psychology of the late twentieth-century.  According to CP, our emotions and feelings are based on or determined by our thoughts (or cognitions).  Your feelings the result of what you think.  But the problem with using your feelings and somatic sensations to determine and identify what you are thinking stems from the fact that your physiological reactions underspecify what you are feeling and consequently also what you are thinking.  You can't use nausea, extreme butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, rapid heart beat to determine what you are feeling, since you might be feeling pre-test anxiety or the excitement of a hot first date.  Advocates of The Secret would not dispute this.  They embrace this.  However, they recommend that you focus on your feelings (using a simplistic index of feeling good or feeling bad) as if these feelings were enough to go on in deciding what you feel.

5) In order to determine what you are thinking, you need to usually proceed in the reverse order.  In most cases, you need to know what your situation is and what you are thinking about your situation in order to grasp what you are feeling.  And in order to know what you're situation is, you need to direct your attention to reality that is external to your mind and consciousness--namely, to pay attention to your current social environment and `what you are' in it, and whether you have the capabilities to cope with its demands or not.  And this environmental information can't be derived by personal introspection, no matter how intense or focused it is.  This already suggests that your mental reality--that is, your internal psychic environment--is partially determined by the environment in which you are operating.  So, here's the take-home:  by focusing exclusively on your ""feelings,"" you are cutting yourself off from other relevant information--indeed, vitally relevant--to your self-knowledge.  Instead you need to focus on grasping your `situation' and on the various beliefs about it.  First and foremost among these are your beliefs about your abilities--your perceived self-efficacy--to cope with your situation.

For a truth-yielding, agency-affirming and self-empowering work in sociocognitive theory, read Stanford professor Albert Bandura's, Self-Efficacy:  The Exercise of Control.  Bandura's work is empirically-tested, conceptually rigorous, and personally life-altering.",1308182400,3,12253,5.225294418842806

Helen",1307145600,,168,3.8285714285714287
1604717,1,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD is predicated on a lie.

Despite the cinematically arresting camerawork in the intro and the stellar editing,  it is utterly deceitful to promote the fiction that ""The Secret"" has been surpressed, burned, hidden, buried and the province of only  a select, privileged view. This carefully promoted myth is nothing more than self-serving fiction created by marketers to create a buzz, which they no doubt have.

First, there is no ""secret"". The  philosophy of this book has been given to the public by some of the most most generous and successful human beings---most of who lived before Byrne could spell the word ""cat:: Emerson, Orison Swett Marden, Dale Carnegie, Marcus Aurelius, Jose Silva, Harold Sherman, Thomas Troward, Yogananda, Maxwell Maltz, Shakespeare, Napolean Hill, Andrew Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, Richard Bach...the list is very long.

To suggest there is a SINGLE secret in the book or Dvd--much less THE SECRET--and  Rhonda Byrne rediscovered it  is utterly reprehensible, self-aggrandizing, and shameful.

Need proof: Order the spare ""It Works"" from Amazon written more than a half century ago or go to Project Guttenberg or the ""New Thought Library"". If your pocket is a little deeper, order a used copy of ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" by Richard Bach, ""Thoughts are Things"" by Prentice Mulford, or ""Your Invisible Power"" by Genevieve Behrend. (From Amazon, of course.)

I dare you to read any of these without seeing the shameless palming of the thoughts of these people on the power of belief and the mystery of thought.

The book does prove one thing beyond doubt: Oprah Winfrey is a shrewd business woman but one who will believe just about anything and a thumbs up from her can take a book that sold a paltry 18,000 copies and turn it into a New York Times best-seller overnight that has sold 100,000 copies.",1306886400,2,1849,5.0493421052631575

1604795,5,B00005JPJ8,"I have to use others word's that accurately describe mine. ""self-actualization phenomenon known as The Secret pivots on the time-honored new age notion of the Laws of Attraction"": ""think positively, and positive things will come to you."" This is the enhanced and extended DVD edition; in 92 minutes, The Secret introduces a parade of teachers hailing from various fields, including psychology, metaphysics, quantum physics, theology, spirit channeling, and personal motivation. Familiar faces and thoughts include those of John Gray (Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus), Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations with God), and What the Bleep Do We Know? veteran Fred Alan Wolf. Like What the Bleep...?, this film underscores its principles, although here the stories are varied, in contrast to the earlier film's single, Marlee Matlin-focused narrative. Produced and narrated by Australian television veteran Rhonda Byrne, The Secret's ultimate goal for viewers is, as Johnny Mercer put it, to ""accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative,"" and ""don't mess with Mr. In-Between."" For many, that in itself is an eye-opener.",1304121600,,1124,5.578947368421052

1604798,4,B00005JPJ8,"Simply, The Secret is being positive and eliminating all negative influences in your life including toxic marital or living partners, friends, business associates, and anyone else who is a negative force. Also, you need to eliminate drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, fast food and anything else that is destroying your body. And, forget about God: it is your responsibility.

This is an excellent motivational video for novices or those simply seeking guidance. But, it simply is an amalgamation of Postive Thinking, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, Confucianism, and Karma theory. You can get the same from Anthony Robbins, Norman Vincent Peale, Jack Kornfield, Ram Dass, Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Gary Zuiker and many others. Plus, ""What The Bleep,"" is a better program and book.

But, that does not mean this is bad. It simply depends on where you are on The Path and what you want to achieve. The secret is there is no secret. You have to take control of your ego and desires: focus on what is truly important. If you think money will solve your problems then you should pass on this and buy one of the many books or programs about Multi-Level Marketing (MLM). If you think a new car will make you popular, then you truly need this. Addicts will benefit if they truly want to change.

Jews and evangelical Christians will not like this program because it is the antithesis of Judaism. It does not preach revenge and retribution. It does not promote ceremonies and rituals nor endorse revenge against the Egyptians. Nor does it endorse racist theories such as Jews being ""chosen people,"" or Jesus being god. This is the essence of the Bill of Rights from the Constitution of the United States of America: all people are created equal. True democracy based on equality rather than religious superiority.

The basic principle is the essence of Quantum and Particle Physics: we are all equal because we are created from atoms which are made from formless energy. How we conduct our life is our decision and has nothing to do with god. There is no predestination nor better life after death. The universe we inhabit was created by nuclear explosions approximately 13.5 billion years ago and life forms have evolved since then. We don't know what existed before creation of this universe and nobody knows how it will evolve. Religion is simply an opiate for the ignorant. Prayer will not change your life. It is all up to you, not god.

Rhonda Byrne, producer of The Secret, is simply a writer/producer of a video and book. She is not god. But, she deserves thanks for promoting a sensible life plan.",1303344000,,2598,4.855530474040632

1604941,1,B00005JPJ8,"Total crap that crosses the line of credibility, traveling well into the realm of intellectual insult and irreligious blasphemy.  The one that stands to make the promised fortune out of her snake-oil franchise is Byrne - which makes it less like a ""secret"" and more like a con trick that's been played by scam artists for centuries.  The only amazing part is that people are gullible enough to let her do it.
Her ""whatever you most desire will come into your life"" premise completely fails to explain - and conveniently sidesteps - natural disasters, personal tragedies, and most importantly, the existence of evil and mankind's capacity for being cruel.  If you follow her teachings through to their natural conclusion, you must also, for instance, believe that the Holocaust happened because millions of Jews wanted to be eradicated.
The ""proof"" she gives for her assertions consists of a scattering of pontificating, hearsay, Dr. Phil-esque testimonials, as well as a suspicious lineup of ""quotes"" she attributes to famous historical figures.  From scientists to presidents to religious teachers - even Jesus himself - Byrne claims they were all privy to this esoteric secret and used it to get wealth, success, and fame.
Anyone at all familiar with the Bible, or even just the teachings of Christ, will know that He consistently spoke out against materialism and selfish greed, the very thing she encourages in her viewers/readers.  The claim that each of us is God disturbingly pops up repeatedly throughout both book and movie, and transports this hogwash scam from a laughable waste of time to out-and-out heresy.

There were no subtitles as promised and to be honest it was an insult. I bought 'The Secret' through Borders Books, its publisher is listed as 'TS' (from New York) Productions, LLC. And its an LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) for a very good reason, because they know they are selling junk for $10.00 a pop, is because it is such a small amount of money, they know people won't bother suing the company, because it isn't worth the aggravation. One note, the full cost version is listed as published as TS Merchandising. Another point, the producers listed offering the DVD are an assortment of companies - some without even a producer mentioned. Really, don't waste your money on this. This is the first time I'd give a '0' stars if I could. I hope the book is more genuine then this garbage DVD was. Spend your money on a good pizza instead - it'll be more filling!-)",1296950400,,1359,4.714285714285714

The Law of Attraction is one term for it, but it's been around for thousands of years in one form or another. The challenge is to learn how to change ingrained ways thinking so that you invite what you want and what benefits you and others. The people behind the movie (and in it) understand this and have discovered a  variety of approaches to making that mental switch.

Out of nowhere, her just starts talking about the Secret and how it has completely changed his life.

I was impressed with him and how he talked that I could tell he was a changed man. He was always hard up for money, obese, teeth missing, but a nice guy. He was now lean, held his head up high, had bought a house, his whole life had completely changed and it was visible on his face. He told me about the Secret, I ordered 2 nights later from Amazon.com, I've watched it and let me tell you, the Secret brilliantly tells you staright forward, how it all works. If you believe, it will work. If you don't believe, nothing will change you.

The Secret delivers it all up front with no bull, and no other books or DVD's to buy. Watch the first 20 minutes on Youtube, then buy the Secret as the rest is very important.

I started with the Secret CDs a couple of years ago and I leave them in my car and listen to them almost daily - sometimes for just a few minutes and sometimes longer (great if you commute).  At first, The Secret is a hard concept to understand, accept and apply. The basis of the Secret is that your thoughts determine how your life will unfold.  If you learn to control your thoughts, you can control how your life unfolds.  Really, it's the power of positive thinking - just taken a step further.  They talk a lot about the Laws of Attraction (which at first made me think of love - but it relates to everything) and about how like attracts like.  Positive things come to positive people - focus on the positive - determine what you really want out of this life (I continue to be amazed at how I can flip flop on this - and they talk about how flip flopping can cause nothing to happen - - because you are not sure, and not clear on what you want).  They talk about the Universe gives back to you what you primarily think/feel about.  How feelings are indicators of what you are thinking (which is true, you don't feel good when you are thinking bad thoughts).  I think this is where a lot of people get turned off...sounds ""hippyish"", for lack of a better description.  But for me, as a believer in God, it all makes perfect sense. The universe is designed to work on auto pilot...you get out of it what you put into it. They reference the bible and tons of other resources in the CDs and DVD (the DVD is the same as the CDs) - the concept that YOU create what happens in your life was not easy for me to understand - having been raised catholic believing that God determines your path - this was a new concept for me.  But eventually made perfect sense - God wants us to have free will and choice - so we choose how we are, which all begins with a thought, etc., and we pave our own path.  And it all begins with a simple thought - kind or malicious, fearful or not, positive or negative.  Charles Haanel gets into the fear ""factor"" a little more - you just don't realize how often and how much FEAR plays a part in your everyday life - - and what it's doing is blocking or holding back things from coming to you.  Just amazing stuff and it took me about a year to really be able to digest it all.  SO its been two years since I learned of the Secret and I started studying Charles Haanel (one of the resources/references in The Secret) about a year ago - and I can tell you that my life is VERY different now - personally, healthwise, financially, mentally, spiritually - I feel empowered and have experienced some really wonderful things as a result of having learned The Secret.  Once you get it, it's hard not to be enthusiastic.

1605652,5,B00005JPJ8,"I bought The Secret on video after watching the 20 min preview. I am glad I bought it. The content more or less set out in very plain language what I already knew, however, the information was constructed well to perhaps bring the knowledge together more structurally. The video described how positive thinking can bring more positives into ones life, and magnify the happy experiences. Positive thinking towards what one wants to achieve, describes hope. Believing one can achieve it without doubt, is faith. Such hope and faith will make one lovable, and then able to love another. Happiness is based on these principles. One thing I would like to add is, that 'the universe' as some described it in the video, while others described it as 'God', is the power behind all the 'law of attraction', shows a universal belief of some central power of some sort. My belief is that the power is Christ. I believe that faith can only truly be had in Christ. If we believe the flowers are going to grow, we shouldn't have faith in the flowers themselves, but in Christ, that he created the flowers to grow that way under certain conditions. The same way, if we believe we can overcome a health issue, we should have faith in Christ, that he will remove it if the doctors can't. However, I will add also, that there are other laws which are unchangeable. We all are born, and we will die. These things we can't prevent. However, if we believe, or have faith, we will reap the most happiness, and things will work to our good, according to our capacity, or potential; in other words, according to the laws of boundaries that we are not permitted to pass over. I recommend this video, but keep an open mind, and try to ponder how your belief system ties in with it.",1280188800,,1755,4.556962025316456

1605704,5,B00005JPJ8,"For most of us, the information in this video is not new -- it has been around for awhile. However, in this format it is well presented & entertaining, and came along when we really needed to be reminded of it all. When you have forgotten something, hearing it again can be a revelation. The big point is not about money & getting stuff, but rather about being thankful and focusing on the positive so that is what you are attracting.  Too often we consciously or unconsciously focus on the negative (it is the easier, more natural thing to do) not realizing how destructive & counterproductive it is.
Be grateful, adapt an attitude of gratitude, and state your intentions in the affirmative, with love. The Secret is a secular presentation of Biblical truths, and people who have been jaded by hypocritical Bible thumpers may be more receptive to this approach. Many of the premises in The Secret are also presented in Pastor Joel Osteen's ""Your Best Life Now"", which I found to be a good balance to The Secret. I also recommend ""THE PATH, Creating Your Mission Statement For Work & Life"" by Laurie Beth Jones, for helping to crystallize your focus & goals with visualization exercises.
My husband found a signed copy of ""Think and Grow Rich"" many years ago (Jack Canfield cited the author, Napoleon Hill, for introducing him to the concept of The Secret), & we've been reading it with renewed interest. Although we've had it for all this time, we had to reach a point of being receptive to the information in order to be able to absorb it. We were ready for The Secret and by playing it over & over, were able to work through a crippling anxiety attack & financial crunch -- along with prayer and the encouragement of good friends (who sent the DVD to us).
Things are much better now, and getting better still, mostly from the shift of our own mindset, which led to a shift in our situation. It all starts with being grateful for what you have, and having that attitude of gratitude at the core of all your thoughts and actions. Act as though you already are who you want to be, doing what you want to be doing and preparing for the life you seek, while being grateful for where you are right now...the rest will follow.",1276214400,,2222,4.541147132169576

Og hvis man nsker en ting nok, virkelig brnder for det, s kan alt lade sig gre. Det er her at der ligger en lille fare i, at man kan blive depressiv. Skyldes alle de ulykker man kommer ud for, s at man selv har nsket dem?? I ""The Secret"" vil man sige at du har tiltrukket dem og derfor at man er selvforskyldt.
Tag filmen  og bogen som du vil, men lev den positive del ud og skab en bedre verden for bde dig selv, men ogs for dine medmennesker.  Jeg nskede efter at have startet p at lse bogen, at jeg fik rd til at betale en rejse til Rom. Dagen efter vandt jeg en check p 5000 kroner ( ca. 900 $ ). Om det skyldes det held eller om det var det  ""the secret"" der virkede , det vil jeg ikke kommentere. Men mit liv er i hvert fald lykkeligt '

The movie and the book are based on positive psychology. About how to think positively, can change one life. And if you want a thing enough, really passionate about it, so everything can happen. It is here that there is a slight danger, that you may become depressed. Causes all  accidents in one's life that you wanted them? In ""The Secret"" you will say that you have attracted them, and therefore that it is self-inflicted.

Take the movie and book as you like, but live the good news out and create a better world for both yourself but also for your fellow man. I wanted after starting to read the book that I could afford to pay a visit to Rome. The day after I won a check for 5,000 danish kroner (around $ 900).

However, there isn't really a ""Secret"".  It makes you think there is a conspiracy behind covering up a secret of manifesting what you want, which isn't true. So, spirituality is mixed with marketing, and imagining a certain car sounds a little far fetched, IMHO.  I do like the story where people got healed and where a certain man began attracting women when he changed his thinking.  I can see that happening to someone.  I do believe in the ideas.  It comes from ask and you shall receive, but there is something missing.  Some people have trouble manifesting.  What should you do? That's different to answer. I think you will have to transform your energy through things like EFT (there are some good videos like the tapping solution, and I did buy that, too, and reviewed it), and I do recommend mantra meditation by Thomas Ashley Farrand.

1605936,3,B00005JPJ8,"I have read 100's of very poor books on the Laws of Attraction in the last few years. I started reading books about goal setting, mind control and success principles in 1985. I have used what I learnt from my extensive reading, coupled with academic qualifications, business and psychology experience, to create a consulting company, teaching seminars to corporations in strategic thinking, marketing, goal setting and business development. I also use the principles to help individuals, by guiding them as a Life Coach, teaching people cognitive methods to help goal set and enhance their lives beyond what they could do on their own. As such, I read as many books as I can on a variety of subjects to enhance my knowledge. I can honestly say, that with all that experience, this DVD, is good as an introduction to the concept, BUT it is not as good as a book like Law of Attraction in Action, which I feel covers all bases needed for the LOA to work.

Many people in my experience cannot get the LOA to work, as they have too much OLD subconscious programming blocking the process. You can use the Sedona Method to unblock this old rubbish in the brain, but this DVD, does not cover this area. Also the second key to getting the LOA working, is to take ""Inspired Action"". This DVD seems to make the case for ""thinking will do it all"". ACTION, inspired by the dreams, working with a positive mental attitude, is what is needed. This DVD skips this vital part. The aforementioned book covers this area in great detail. I would also highly recommend Your Road Map to Success by John C Maxwell, as a great book to create a life purpose, from which you can use the LOA. There are other great books on the market that can help, but I recommend starting with these.

This DVD is a nice intro into LOA, but you need to do more reading in the areas I have highlighted, if you wish to get the LOA working in your life. Good DVD as far as it goes.",1268870400,,1938,4.456338028169014

1606064,5,B00005JPJ8,"I became interested in ""The Secret"" by first watching the DVD. I use this audio book to prep me for the day by listening to it each morning while I am getting ready. I am so much happier each day. I feel this knowledge has removed barriers which I never knew I had erected. I now look at everything as an opportunity... especially when things don't go according to plan. I used to believe the quote ""Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans."" Now I know I am truly the one in control of my life including where I fit into the world... including my social-economic status, relationships, happiness, health, and daily events.
Another tool I found helpful to use in conjunction with this book was the book by Michael Losier called ""The Law of Attraction.""  It was extremely valuable as a starting point to identify what one wants and how to begin stating affirmations in a way which one could feel 100% good about. I think Michael Losier's book is an important transitional help as one grows comfortable with those affirmations and can begin moving toward the more effective affirmations ""The Secret"" teaches as one changes the affirmations from ""I am in the process of attracting..."" to ""I am attracting..."" to ""I love having...""",1266105600,,1244,4.680365296803653

If the Secret can liven my spirits when I'm feeling low and ineffectual then why not love the Secret.  It has done that more than just a few times since I've known about the book, video, and gratitude book.  One of my friends (and basically most people from my church) is wary of the fascination over The Secret and the law of attraction because of its overemphasis on the self for pursuing self-interests and not so much concern for outward compassion and humanity.  I find this to be extremely interesting -- meanwhile still doing volunteer work and donating to the needy with genuine grace and a loving heart.

It's when I need to put ""feet to my prayers"" that the principles of the Secret can kick in!!

It didn't mention how much. After filling out the paper work I received a check for $1100 for wages not paid from an employer 2 years ago!

1606217,4,B00005JPJ8,"I haven't read the book, but I have seen the video quite a few times. I struggled with extreme social anxiety and panic attacks for over five years, and watching this program (along with reading and listening to many other audio programs) helped me remember to focus on the positive aspects of my life.

There are certainly more than a few helpful and healthy messages in this program, however, overall it seems to be steered towards the acquisition of material goods and riches. How to obtain your dream house, how to make X amount of money in a year, etc. This becomes a bit annoying as do some of the over the top Hollywood effects, but I'm sure it's the combination of both that have contributed to its huge success.

Overall I'd say it's a good program and you can certainly take some great lessons from it.  However, try not to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of it.

The speakers are some of the best in the business and the message that comes across, does so in a very inspirational way.

The down side is that most people do not understand that this is merely a starting point, or introduction to The Law of Attraction - the production of this video does not stress this point enough in my opinion.  There are many other universal laws that are just as important.  Also, applying this information into real everyday life practice can be difficult for most, although that part of it is not the responsibility of the people sending the message.  If you think you can take this information in and not do any of the work required to make it successful for you, then you will be disappointed.

Overall this is an excellent video of info (done very well), for those of you who practice the universal laws in your everyday lives.  A great add to your home video collection and self study practices.

I would ask anyone who feels trod upon, unlucky, or just desperately hoping for a new and better life to watch this video once a week until their life begins to show signs of turning around.  It might be difficult at first to have any level of blind faith and ignore the negatives, but with a little practice it begins to bear fruit and the concept becomes very easy to put into further practice.
It can become a way of life.",1252713600,,711,4.427480916030534

I'll keep this short.

I found the information in this dvd very, very inspiring and useful.
And most importantly... TRUE.

I've used it myself over and over with much success.

Some of the reviews below cast a negative light on this information.

Those people must have expected something that doesn't exist.

Don't let their negativity keep you from your dreams.

1606516,4,B00005JPJ8,"I thought it was very great and insightful, as per lots of the positive feedback already written about this. Though I must warn you, that they present this as if ""everyone can just get it"" when really -- you need to have at least a ""bare bones basic"" understanding of Quantum Physics in order for ""The Secret"" to not sound like something straight out of Walt Disney.

For closed minded and obsessively skeptical people, this DVD will sound like rubbish and if you are so stuck in the commercial paradigm of materialism -- don't waste your money -- this one is NOT for you.

For those who are open minded but do not quite understand how ""Thought Creates Reality"" and have, as of yet -- no concept of the basics of Neurology, the Sub-Atomic Level of the ""Plank Scale"" and things like this -- then I would recommend you watch ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" *FIRST* before watching The Secret.

If you do a YouTube Search for ""chasers war on everything the secret"" then you will see a perfect example of how the uninformed mind on the outside looking in -- can view ""The Secret"" as being just a bunch of new-agey, mumbo jumbo unrealistic thinking. When your mind is too deep into the capitalism paradigm, it is extremely easy to take things within the realms of Quantum Physics totally out of context.

Primarily because -- much like the wind -- you only know it exists because of your observations, in the mirror of memory -- as per the end resulting effect of the wind. You can not see the wind itself. To describe the ""unseen"" -- one can only use metaphor to assist with conceptual understanding and frame of reference -- with apparel cites to things that are within the realm of ""the seen"" -- much as we do for describing the wind.

A metaphor can only be as accurate as a persons interpretation of it -- and frame of reference only works as well as the viewers level of education in the topic being discussed.",1251849600,,1907,4.468390804597701

Being a fan of Ralph Waldo Emerson, this movie reassured me that my understandings of his philosophy were on target.  There's a lot to be said about the New Thought movement that occurred in in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The production and editing is wonderful.  A lot of my friends and family are not into deep subjects like I am, but I found that ""The Secret"" is a great introduction tool to excite and encourage them to seek more knowledge.",1251849600,,712,4.237037037037037

How can I create a better life? It requires an open mind and the ability to IMAGINE change. It also requires faith in your own ability to create the life you desire through positive imagery.

1606595,1,B00005JPJ8,"First of all, coming from an advertising background, this DVD is a prop. Sure, I believe in the importance of positive thinking. I do it everyday. However, the message I got from viewing this, is if you continue having bad things happen to you, or if you are sick then it's your fault for not believing strongly enough. The message goes further saying that whether you think ""I don't want to be late, I don't want to be late"" then you WILL be late because you were thinking about being late???!!!! What kind of madness is this. This can drive someone crazy. People can't stay happy and positive 100% of their lives. Sadness and depression are real emotions and they are natural to feel at times. So if someone has cancer or a terminally ill disease it is THEIR FAULT FOR NOT thinking positively enough???!! That is the message this DVD implies. I also found the relationship example ridiculous. There is an interview with a producer who tells this lady that ""he wants to date 3 times a week"". So he thinks positively about it and yes, he tells her later he gets 3 dates a week. UNREALISTIC. Even if it were true, don't you think he would get dates because he is a producer and makes a lot of money and gets the women that are using him for that?

I believe in the power of positive thinking, but I do not believe in the damaging messages this DVD holds. I mean if there was a rape victim, the DVD basically says, ""if something bad happens to you, then it's your fault"". So is the rape victim gonna think that he or she is the one at fault? What a horrible message from this DVD.",1247529600,,1578,4.331081081081081
1606596,3,B00005JPJ8,"I thought I ordered the book. But the movie helped me save some time. The movie is still good and inspiring. It has its funny scenes. I just hoped they would have it in spanish as well, now i have to look for the spanish version",1247356800,,228,3.9782608695652173

1606599,5,B00005JPJ8,"A few years back when I first heard about The Secret I was very skeptical about it. Over a year ago, and having several personal problems, a friend asked me if I had seen The Secret. I decided to give it a chance and am I glad I did.

There are several ideas about The Secret that I don't agree with, but overall I find the teachings very useful. As the author says, I was living my life upside down. When things were going fine I was happy and when they were bad I was miserable.

In this last year I have changed this ways of living my life. And believe me, things have changed. I'm not confident in saying my life has changed 180, but it's very close.

I would recommend this DVD and also the books to anyone who feels their life isn't going anywhere. Just a small advice, watch The Secret with an open mind and maybe say ""I'll just give it a try to see what happens"". I'm sure you won't regret it.",1246838400,,901,4.0790960451977405
1606600,5,B00005JPJ8,"There is No Secret that the Secret has recreated more interest in the Law of Attraction and the laws that Wattles taught us 100 years ago.  The DVD has done a great job of bringing this to a new generation and they have done it well.  This should be a starting point, not a `done deal'.  Learn and educate yourself!  There is much more that you need to read and watch and DO to learn to manifest!  Good start!
Also strongly recommended:
If you'd like a Real Library vs. an e-library, a multi - dimensional experience vs. a one - dimensional experience and a record of YOUR thoughts, ideas, goals, interpretations alongside the master authors, then this might be the most important book you'll ever read.
Everything you need to know for your success and future has been written by these masters...and you know, it's all available, ready to be carefully placed in your success library. All you have to do is walk into your library. You will have access to the finest, most ready success masterpieces in the world. The books that collectively have launched millions of millionaires. Soon, you will be one of them - NOT because you bought into some new Internet business, (who knows?), but because you have done the work that takes place right upstairs, in your head: your mindset. And that mindset is the foundation of your fortune. And your fortune is founded on the knowledge you will receive from the Masters. As you commune with them, and acquire that idea that will separate you from the rest of the pack, and begin to fill dollars into your bank account, you will realize it all came from simply reading a key book, jotting down your inspired idea, referring back to it, and taking action. After all, you'll have that `action plan' written in the margins of these books!

Of course they mention ""oh, yes you have to do something than just sitting and wishing..."" but it is the actual WORK that you do that gets you where you want to be, NOT THE WISHING.  The secret, I believe, is just another pseudoscience that replaces the placebo effect.  Everyone thinks ""wow, I sent happy thoughts to everyone and I got the job I wanted!""

They were moving back to the city so her 17 year old daughter can continue her modeling venture.  We spent alot of time with the wonderful family because we had to have people help us move the furniture we purchased from her home on to trucks.  What we recongized is the daughter has been doubting her own abilities to make it in the modeling world.  She was beautiful tall african american girl with a beautiful smile.  Self defeating words like if i can, maybe, and hopefully were in every sentence pertaining to her modeling future.  I Quickly went home a grabbed The Secret and gave it to her.  I told her ""for now own you will claim the things you want and believe it and then at that moment you can have anything you want in life.  Here is The Secret dvd and the book Please start praticing now so that once you settle in to your new place you will have already found the right frequency to get your career up and running"".

If you approach it as ""I want to discover more details about the Law of Attraction, how does it work, how can I better use it"", then definitely not a good viewing.

And that is how I approached it.

Summary: Just a bunch of great authors telling you that you can get anything you want by thinking positive thoughts. That is it. No explanation on how or why (scientifically).

Also, if someone just tells me that if I think good thoguhts good things will come to me and offer no explanation why, then I would like to at least hear real-life stories of how it happen to other people. That is the part that makes me feel better... ""Hey, I don't understand how it works, but after seeing all of these stories of transforming all these other people's lives, I believe it!""

There is only 3 real-life example stories given. For me, they are the best in the DVD and why it alomst got a 3 star. But way too few and too short.

But either way, cd or dvd, I think the Secret is very motivating and useful to help you get in a more positive frame of mind.  The people who speak on it help you to know and believe that you can have a better life, you can turn problems around by thinking of how you want things to be.  A friend first introduced me to the Secret and what a powerful thing the law of attraction is.  It falls in line with my basic Christian beliefs and I try to live it everyday.  When I get off track, it never fails to bring me back to a more positive outlook when I either watch the dvd or listen to the cd. I highly recommend this!",1240012800,,786,3.8875

1606885,2,B00005JPJ8,"The funny thing about ""The Secret"" is that it really isn't a secret, and contrary to the authors, it never was a ""lost"" secret. Those who have read or have access to SUCCESS UNLIMITED magazine, or read authors like Og Mandino, Napoleon Hill or Dr. Norman Vincent Peale will read pratically the same ideas that were presented here. I'm not sure where the authors got the idea that the ""Secret"" was lost, but the ""Law of Attraction"" (though it was called something else) has been around for a long time and has been written about extensively.

  Perhaps that is not a major issue with you, so you want to see what all the hoopla is about and you get the DVD. In defense of the DVD, it does have a very positive message - in that you, along with your negative thoughts, are your greatest enemy. The problem is that the DVD states that all you have to do is think about something that you want (i.e. money, car, house ect) and you will send out positive brain waves into the universe and it will come true. The dangerous thing here is that it might give viewers the wrong impression that all they have to do is sit back and wait for all the money and material possessions to accumulate. This is quite contrary to the Chistian principle of ""You sow what you reap"". This DVD says you can reap all the rewards without sowing anything. And the kicker is this...if, for whatever reason, your ""wishes"" do not come true, then you must be doing it wrong, ""because the Law of Attraction never fails"". The other problem is that it focuses on material things.

Another issue I have is with the Law of Attraction itself. It states that like attracts like. If this were true then magnets would never work. What they do not tell you is that the Law of Attraction is a secondary Law of the Universe, and must first follow several primary Laws of the Universe (i.e. gravity).

So, after viewing the DVD you will probably feel good about yourself and have a renewed self-confidence (which is a great thing), but there are better ways to get the message. This DVD sends a very dangerous message. The DVD (as well as the book) has a brilliant marketing strategy, just don't believe everything you hear or read. It would be to your benefit if you do some research yourself. And if you do a little research, you will find that there is absolutely no connection between the Law of Attraction and the famous people who are portrayed in the DVD to have followed it. There is no evidence (and sometimes evidence to the contrary) that Einstein, Plato, Beethoven or Shakespeare ever believed in the Law of Attraction.",1238457600,,2586,4.505330490405117

1606893,5,B00005JPJ8,"I know that there are 1,798 reviews posted here for The Secret - and mine will be number 1,799 - but it is such an amazing and inspirational, mind altering movie/documentary, that I had to put in my two cents!

Although some might think it is a bit corny in its presentation and narration, Rhonda Byrne and her panel of speakers have created a real and marvelous setting for what I believe is one of the greatest and most inspirational, motivating, eye-opening, mind altering, educational and impact full movies I have seen in a long time.  I have watched it about 20 times now and it never fails to motivate and encourage me.

The first time I watched it immediately stimulated me to start practicing in The Laws of Attraction.  That ""Thoughts become Things"" and that by the power of positive thinking, removing the negative and professing gratitude we will attract everything in the Universe that we want in our lives.  Yet, not only do we need to focus on that Law of Attraction and generating the correct thoughts to attract the things we want in life, but we also have to do something that will generate that attraction and create action to make those things happen.  By generating feelings of gratitude and by believing with all your might, with unwavering faith that you will get or achieve what you desire - that combined with the correct action - you WILL achieve what it is you want.

I have seen the CD countless times, I read the Daily Teachings as well as write in My Gratitude Journal.  I will say that 95% of the things I focus on, want and desire - have come true, in one way or another.  I have recommended The Secret to many of my friends, who have also been inspired to put these teachings into practice to make great things happen for them in their lives. It really works and for all the non-believers that have written unhelpful reviews here - well I guess it goes to show that if you are pessimistic and negative - you will get negative (that is probably why The Secret teachings are not working for them) yet, if you have unwavering faith that you can achieve what you desire by the power of your positive thoughts working on the Laws of the Universe... `YOUR THOUGHTS WILL BECOME THE THINGS YOU WANT"".

I also loved the quotations interspersed throughout the DVD by greats such as, Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, Buddha, Martin Luther King, Einstein and many more...",1237334400,,2385,4.577464788732394

1606964,1,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD is a compilation of narratives by various New Age and self-help authors who advocate a philosophy called ""The Law of Attraction"". Basically this ""law"" says that if you have positive thoughts positive things happen to you and if you have negative thoughts negative things happen to you. While I agree that it is best to be positive this DVD is loaded with a boatload of deceit. One commentator tells a ludicrous story of how he made a poster with his dream house on it. One day he wakes up and to his amazement he is living in that exact house! Ask yourself why he didn't realize he was moving into that house earlier and you will understand how ludicrous this presentation is.

With the onset of the financial meltdown most people are waking up to the ridiculousness of this DVD which purports to deliver wealth, hot babes, and cool cars for no effort. The last decade was hallmarked by debt fueled prosperity, which is not real wealth, so the magic probably seemed real to a lot of people.

I had a friend who was very big into The Secret. He had dollar bills pasted all over his house with ""one million"" inked in. He posted up all kinds of aphorisms reassuring him how easy it is to get rich. After two years of such nonsense, without becoming a millionaire, he finally had to get a real job after nearly bankrupting his family.

My wife and I had an art show in November and because of the economy figured we would sell very little. We had worked hard so were disappointed at the bad timing. But we had already committed to the opening so pressed on. To our surprise it was our best show ever and we sold more in one night than we usually did in a month.

Our ""secret""? Sacrifice, hard work, and trying our best to paint beautiful paintings.

Something for nothing is a daydream and this DVD trades on that fantasy.",1237161600,,1827,4.425595238095238

I later found out that the authority figures who appear in the movie are great teachers and through them I discovered even more and continue my education to this day.

Some people complain that the information presented doesn't delve into all of the steps necessary to manifest the life of your dreams.  But this was not it's purpose.  It is a fantastic introduction and if you choose to continue on your journey and wish to become an expert you must expand your education beyond this movie.  There's only so much that a movie can do, and what this movie is here to do is to touch, move and inspire you which it does so perfectly.",1235520000,2,821,4.620689655172414

If you do, you will attract people and processes in to your life that help you achieve that but if you are negative and unhappy this is what you are likely to experience more of.

Physicists, philosophers, counselors, writers, spiritual/esoteric leaders - there's a mix of people who present one, clear message. Quotations from avatars in history add a cohesiveness - Einstein, Michelangelo, Emerson... It shows that we do have the power within ourselves to attract what we truly desire. It makes sense. It clarifys what our purpose is. There's a bit of corniness in the presentation, but don't let that interfere with the overall content. I highly recommend it.",1235260800,,733,5.016393442622951

So overall, the movie is still nice to watch and to give you a little positive boost, but the extent to which you can and should apply it to your life is still dependent on yourself.",1235174400,,557,4.46078431372549

The appeal is to the same person that falls for cult rituals or a promise of a future of being rich and famous.  Even the values they continuously use to present the idea (get rich quick, have an affluent life style, etc.) are far from what intelligent and self-actualized people would see as goals for their life.  Their attempt to indentify famous people with knowing and utilizing ""The Secret"" is a hoax.  If we could ask these famous people if this was their secret, I am sure they would say no.  It might have been a small part of their secret but surely there were a host of other more important factors.
Don't waste your time with the book or DVD.

So Hitler was not really evil; he was just a manifestation of what our collective mind was conjuring up, and he ""probably was not all bad."" (Wow.) There is negative energy and positive energy, but just Who decides what is negative and positive and why there's a difference (since there's no evil) is not really explained.

I knew it was a popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/1582701709/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>&nbsp;but that's it.  My mother-in-law had this DVD hanging around among her other movies and so I borrowed it because, well, I didn't know the secret.

As it were, the secret is not a secret at all.  The idea that if you stay focused on one thing and believe that it will happen will actually work toward providing that goal is really nothing new.  Being positive is a good thing but its impact on the cosmos at large as asserted here and by others who put stock into the law of attraction, is irresponsible at best, and self-righteous greed propaganda to the core.  Bob Proctor, one of the secret's voices and supporters (I'd like to see how much money he made from this), even goes as far as to say that the reason such a small percentage of the population controls so much wealth is because they know and practice the secret.  That should get the capitalists to stay focused and proud.  But what on earth happens to those of us stuck in a caste system?  Those of us who have to work for ten cents a day?  Those of us who live in a war zone?  Or even those of us working to survive in a dying economy because of over-simplified libertarian pseudo-science like this?  Are we to believe they are somehow responsible for their own plight?

Another reviewer used the term unfalsifiable to explain the secret's philosophies.  That is certainly appropriate.  I think of the creationists, who today defend the unobservable as intelligent design theorists, and their battle with evolutionary and natural selection.  As the material world becomes more measurable over time, they will always adapt beyond the measurable and set up base there.  The secret and the law of attraction is just as guilty of this, only they are also perpetuating and celebrating an ethos of greed and disgusting levels of pride.  Then again how could anyone be surprised to see such a philosophy embraced in our culture of competition?

I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble here, so take my opinion for what it is; it is after all just one person's view.  The last thing I would want to do is downplay any positive effects this may have on people.  I have no doubt the secret's philosophies have been hugely beneficial to many and I can certainly see how.  That is the only reason I'm not giving this one star.",1232582400,5,2571,4.830663615560641

I like all version of ""The Secret"" because I feel that, although materialistically oriented, they are moving the masses towards a spiritual awakening.  The Secret has done us all a favor by bringing spirituality to the previously uninterested.

I love The Secret and other books like it because it has paved the way for writers like myself to awareness to the healing power of emotional release.  You can find my work right here on amazon called ""Reality Creation 101"".  After you've read The Secret, you'll be ready to learn how to heal every facet of your life.",1232323200,2,681,4.641666666666667
1607264,1,B00005JPJ8,"I have to say it: I think The Secret and The Law of Attraction are a bunch of garbage.  The idea of the Law of Attraction, as shown in the movie ""The Secret"" is that if you really picture something happening, and you put a lot of energy into it, and you focus all your intent and emotions into it, that it will happen.

Here's the proof that The Secret doesn't work:

Six million men subscribe to Playboy.  There are a couple dozen women featured in each issue.  From my understanding, most of those men are not reading Playboy for the articles.  They are focusing all their emotions and their thoughts on having sex with one of those women.  They put time and energy and imagination into it.  They do everything that The Secret says.

Now, divide six million male subscribers by, say, 200 women featured naked in Playboy every year.  Therefore, unless each woman featured in Playboy is having sex with 30,000 men each year, there's no way that men who imagine themselves with a woman from the magazine actually have their dreams come true.  In fact, if even 1% of those men were to achieve their fantasy with ANY woman in Playboy, not just a centerfold, that would mean that each woman would have to have sex with 300 men a year.  Somehow, I don't think that's happening.

That's why I think The Secret is nonsense.

Here are some other examples:

Since The Secret is well known, it's practiced by a lot of people, including many who have coaches to tell them exactly how to do it.  This would include pageant contestants, PGA golfers, and professional athletes.  Yet, do you really think that Tiger Woods wins golf tournaments because he believes he will?  Or is it instead because he spends hours a day working on his swing?  The reason why Miss California or Miss Texas win more Miss America pageants than Miss Idaho or Miss Oklahoma is that the bigger, more populous states have more contestants at the lower levels, so that the Misses California and Texas have to beat more people, are more prepared, have more money, practiced more, and are more likely to be more beautiful and more talented than contestants who had less competition.  It's not a matter of wanting or thinking about it more.

Or how about this: why don't celebrity stalkers get to meet their celebrity, other than in court when they're convicted and sentenced?  They clearly imagine conversations with the celebrity; they visualize it perfectly; they take steps to make it happen.  The Secret should work for them but it doesn't.

(The people behind The Secret explain that failure to meet your goals is because deep, deep down, you didn't really believe it would work.  A convenient excuse.)

Do you want other examples?  How about this:

According to the Law of Attraction, you also would attract bad things to you if you think about them: they use the example of thinking about your debts and then receiving bills in the mail.  So does that mean that a two-year-old with leukemia somehow wished it?  Or her parents did?  Why don't mass murderers like Hitler just drop dead if millions of people want them to?  Did six million Jews die in the Holocaust because they thought about it?  How come suicidal people don't just have a heart attack and die?  Why does the abusive husband keep beating his wife if she wishes he were dead?  How come cancer researchers don't get more cancer than other people?  Or less, for that matter, since they're always thinking about a cure for cancer?  How come most lottery winners don't win as much money as they spend on the lottery, since clearly they're visualizing themselves winning every time they buy the ticket?  How come more prisoners don't escape from jail?  And for people who grew up rich, did they somehow imagine being born to rich parents while still in the womb?

In order to believe in The Secret, you have to believe that good and evil things happen in the world because people wish them.  That's magical thinking and it's nonsense.

There is a new movie about The Secret and how to make it work for you, called ""Beyond The Secret.""  I think that the people who make the movies make The Secret work by selling this stuff to willing believers.  The Secret makes them money as a marketing tool to part you from your money.  Rhonda Byrne is a very rich woman from repackaging ideas that have been around for decades.

If you want to achieve wealth, save your money, live on less than you make, research investments and diversify your holdings.  Actions speak louder than thoughts.

The astonishing thing to me is that more people aren't speaking up against this.  Try googling ""The Law of Attraction is nonsense"" or ""The Law of Attraction is garbage"" and you don't find much.

1607269,3,B00005JPJ8,"Like the reviewer Denise above, I was interested to find out what all the excitement was over this movie.  Seeing the movie unfold, I expected some great profound mysterious secret to be unveiled.  I was quite disappointed to find that the entire movie revolved very simply over something that every church goer or anyone who has picked up a bible or even a positive self help book and that is, ""Believe that you have already received and it shall be given unto you..."".  After seeing the entire movie, I said to myself, ""That's IT?  This whole secret business is revolving around this one-sentence truth?""  I was a bit disappointed.

Another premise of the movie is that the ""universe will align itself to us..."" which means that the entire universe will shift itself for us.  But this is false since it isn't the universe that changes, it is the way we think and the positive changes in our own mind and lives that bring about the already awaiting blessings of the universe.  It is US who must change, make the positive changes to align ourselves to the fundamental principles of the laws of the Universe, not the other way around.  So the movie conveys two messages which seem to conflict:  1) That the universe changes for us and 2) that when we think positive, we make the universe change for us.

The way I see it, people must change their heart and minds to be one of abundance, love, and giving, in order to be the recipients of what blessings are waiting for them from the ""universe"".  Also, what is the definition of the ""Universe""?  Is it supposed to be God or the Creator?  God MADE the universe, not the other way around.  God is bigger and greater than the thing He made and He made the universe as a fertile magnificant resource for us.  When we change ourselves to be in alignment and living these very positive fundamental spiritual principles, we become the recipients of what is already stored up for us - as great gifts from a Creator who loves each of us.

Seems like the movie has a message that positive thinking brings everything you want.  The movie seems to be want-and-attain based and certainly could have been more about how not only to receive but how to be a blessing and a resource of love and joy for others.  I do like how the movie did state several times that receiving is very important.  Many times in this society of selfishness and control, we think more about getting, attaining, and controlling, than we do about loving, resting, and receiving.  You can just tell by our social conditioning that many people receive with a selfish heart instead of a greatful abundant filled heart that has gratitude. Gratitude begins with being greatful for exactly what you have around you before you can be greatful for what you don't have - yet.  The movie did talk about this and that was a very good reminder.

There was a kind of selfish undertone to it and it was more about getting and attracting and wanting and desiring.  Not that these things are bad but they were certainly out of proportion to the other side of the same coin principle:  That in order to be a recipient of great blessings, we also have to have open love and blessings for others so that the great power of the laws of abundance can flow through us to all.  This was hinted upon but mostly missed.  It is mentioned as one of the principles but could have been pressed a little more since this is an area that people often severely overlook.

I was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie when the genie popped out because first of all, the Aladdin character was desperate, sneaking around corners of the building as if he had stolen the lamp and then desperately, he rubs the lamp with anxiety on his face.  The genie came out of the lamp and it seemed like suddenly the great potent force of the entire physical world was reduced down to a hunky looking blue guy saying ""your wish is my command"".  It may have reached some people in this symbology but it sort of weakened the concept of the ""universe"" to me.

I see the universe as God's creation and in that creation He made all things available and set the laws of Love in motion so that it could be a self regulating, self operative and self sustaining power and when we align OURSELVES to that power by changing ourselves, (not aligning the universe to us), we reap the benefits of living a positive love filled live has to offer.

And I use the word God which seems to be less popular these days as many people are anti-God and anti-Christ so they prefer benign distant terms like ""universe"" and ""universal power"" in order to keep the personal relationship aspect of a Deity at a distance.  Whatever!

Good merits of the movie is that if no one has any foundational understanding or introduction to the power of positive thinking or for someone just beginning to have some kind of hope and faith in their dreams, this movie is a good beginning, a very beginner simplistic concept.  Anyone with any more substantial education in spiritual development and positive thinking probably can use the movie as a refresher course in ""Postive Thinking 101"".

I'm not saying this movie is bad, it is very good, especially for people trying to get their breakthrough.  I bought a copy of it and refer to it now and then.  But it is only part and parcel to a bigger picture.  Also, I find the book more interesting than the movie and the book is a very good thing to have in one's collection.",1231200000,3,5443,4.509683995922528

1607401,1,B00005JPJ8,"The so-called ""law of attraction' is an old story. Just think of what you want and it will come to you. That may sound good to lazy people, but when you read biographies and autobiographies of successful people you find that they succeed because of hard work, persistence, resourcefulness, creativity and especially making sure they have a good, viable goal. Also a little luck, such as being in the right place at the right time, can play a major role. Some people are born healthy and come into solid families under well-off conditions, while others come into this world to experience much more difficult conditions. For some youngsters, sadly, the odds are greater that they will end up in jail than experience real success, and that is due to a large extent to the environment they have to live in. As President Kennedy observed long ago, ""Life is not fair.""
""The Secret"" also claims if you think about bad things, they will come to pass. That, too, is untrue. As a child I discovered what I call the law of anti-prophecy, and it has always worked for me. When I was scared that something bad might happen to me, all I would do is imagine it happening. and guess what? My imagining it guaranteed that it would NOT happen! That is something that has never failed for me.

He appeared to be well- read and well-versed in marketing and business development, so I was intrigued that something had gotten him this excited.  The online movie was $4.95 compared to the CD set of $29.95.  What could I lose by watching a documentary about achieving success for 90 minutes for less than $5.00? After sitting down and watching the movie, I came away asking myself, ""What did I miss?"" What did my friend see that I didn't causing him to start a ""Laws Of Attraction"" group?  As a practitioner within the field of human development, this information was Self-Mastery 101.  The people interviewed in the movie fell right into place with the ominous, seemingly arcane backdrop.  I could easily conclude that my extensive reading on the subject matter made the movie appear overly simplistic.  But, an adherent of any of the world religions should echo similar sentiments.  Instead of a deity, ""The Secret"" credits the indomitable will of the human spirit.  It doesn't use those words, but one could easily surmise the point.  ""The Secret"" uses the basic tenets of world religions mixed with the motivational messages of the 1990's shrouded in a ""Da Vinci Code""-like motif.

The real ""secret"" is the effective ways by which religion, motivation and marketing is synergistically molded to create a sense of newness out of archaic messages.  Should you watch ""The Secret?""  Yes, not merely for the oft- quoted principles projected, but to get a sense of how concepts presented persuasively can capture the imagination of the populous in ways that traditional religion has not.

1607466,2,B00005JPJ8,"I used the Secret (both the book and this video) for a Wednesday night Bible Study at my church.  We were doing a 10-week Cult Study.  So, I chose the Secret for one of my resources while discussing the New Age Religion.  It was exactly what I expected and was actually very clear regarding the ""gospel"" it is preaching.  The basic line runs:  you are in control, you control your destiny, you can even control your environment.  One of the ladies interviewed actually said plainly, ""you are god.""  You can't get much clearer than that.  Nor can you contradict the Gospel of Jesus Christ more severely than that. Be aware when you purchase this product, you are not hearing a neutral ""spiritual"" talk.  You are hearing a gospel that does not lead to life.  Anyone who is willing to be honest with themselves will admit, even if to only themselves, ""I am not in control.""

1607467,2,B00005JPJ8,"Imagine yourself actually doing that job you want so much.  Keep that image in your mind.  Think positively about it all the time; do not allow doubt to enter your thoughts.  Send out an earnest request to the universe to give you this thing you want.  And supposedly it will happen.

I am not a spiritual person by any stretch of the imagination, but at least with religious beliefs, you don't always get what you want, and you don't necessarily find out why you didn't get the thing for which you prayed.  God works in mysterious ways, and it is not our place to question.

In _The Secret_, all that can be said is that one has not put enough effort into the scenario/beliefs, so it's one's shortcomings as a full-on, no-questions-asked believer that cause one to fail.

Here is the essential problem with expectations.  We will not get what we want all the time.  Often we will get things we don't want, like miserable marriages or cancer.  And no amount of positive thinking can circumvent some of this stuff.  Yes, I understand the mind over matter principles, but to say that faith in the universe and a positive outlook will result in a happy life is purely magical thinking.

Expectations are not always met.  In my view, it's far healthier to stop expecting anything in particular.  When things happen that we like, we rejoice.  When unpleasant things happen, we can handle that that, too; it's the luck of the draw and not a personal vendetta against us.",1227916800,,1464,4.616279069767442

They expect instant results because they've been conditioned that way by movies and television.  In order for the Law of Attraction to work you must be steady and consistent in your attention, energy and focus on what you want then take the appropriate action when an opportunity manifests itself; that's how it works.

""Think and Grow Rich"", ""The Richest Man in Babylon"",""See You at The Top"", ""The Science of Getting Rich"",""Psycho Cybernetics"",""The Power of Positive Thinking"", ""The Seth Material"", ""The Peter Principle"",Tibetan Book of the Dead, and several books by L. Ron Hubbard which didn't impress me enough to recall their titles.

In all of these titles, I found a nugget or gem of truth, but because I could only appreciate them intellectually and compare each with other works of a similar nature, I never got beyond a ""reviewer's perspective"". I could argue the merits and demerits of each volume. Yet, my life was not better for my intellectual appreciation.

Then one day, out of nowhere, steped a little Australian blond named Rhonda Byrne who opened her hand to reveal an encrusted ancient key saying, ""Were you missing this, mate?"" Tears welled in my eyes because I was missing that key!

What's the key? I suppose I could say the key is revealed in the work entitled ""The Secret""; get a copy. But I won't do that because you might be like me and desperately need this information. Get this now! The key to ""The Secret"" IS DOING IT AND LIVING IT!

Keep the Gratitude Diary every day. Meditate. Take time out to just go out and walk and breathe deeply. Don't appreciate this secret intellectually by comparing it to other tomes and self help works. LIVE THE SECRET.

When you get the ""gratitude attitude"" and realize just who you are instead of who you are told by science and religion you are, you will turn your life around setting course for new vistas of happiness and prosperity. Realize first, happiness and joy must come before any material benefits you anticipate or desire. As Jack Canfield says, ""If it ain't fun, don't do it."" Never truer words were spoken.

The point to get is really going to rough up your fur; especially if your are religious or skeptical. No matter that science says you evolved from a gob of goo or that religion says you are an unworthy sinner needing repentance and salvation; when you ""GET""(comprehend) The Secret, you will realize God isn't OUT THERE God is YOU!(in here).

You are God. God is eternal. God comes into form, moves through form, and moves out of form eternally. If you also get the CD ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" and ""What the Bleep Do We Know...Down The Rabbit Hole?"" you will find physicists beginning to agree that quantum physics points to the reality of the Universe being THOUGHT. In the billions and billions of light years of cubic space extending forever in all directions away from our planet Earth, there has never been found any other life or life forms for the last fifty years of NASA investigations,Seti radio astronomy, and space probes.

Despite the fact that Science earnestly desires to find intelligent life in the Universe, it won't. Despite the fact that fundamentalists of every religion propound salvation comes only to true believers and ardent upholders of faith, salvation comes when humanity realizes the ideal of godhood manifesting everything by the power of pure thought.

Sounds like I am a new convert to a new and very subtle religion, doesn't it? Yet, I am only explaining what an impact this volume has had on my life. Americans are performance driven. Not seeing immediate results always gives the lie to such claims by this perspective. Yet, performance varies with experience and skill. No, I am not yet rich. But, I will be. And, it will come by my perfect understanding of and practice living the Secret.

The really funny thing is the secret has been revealed in every one of the books I mentioned above. It is in the Christian Bible, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Koran, and Vedas. It is out there for anyone to see. But, I didn't see it until that little Australian blond, Rhonda Byrne had the faith and guts to publish ""The Secret"". The CD is simply a mind blower. She got all the great minds together who really understand who they are and what the secret is in practice. If you want to change your life and prosper, say ""Yes"" when that little Australian blond comes to with her hand outstretched saying as she reveals a beat up old key in the palm of her hand, ""Missing this, mate?""

When I first watched the secret it had all the potential to be the 'life changing secret' that it claimed, however this film is more philosophical and actually lacking in any scientific proof. So what's the solution?

its called ""What The Bleep.""

What the Bleep, (especially the quantum edition), has all the science that the secret was lacking. Interestingly enough, What the Bleep seems to have all the facts, while not being totally clear on what to do with the facts. This is where the secret comes in.

BASICALLY: The Secret and What The Bleep complement each other perfectly and the combination of both leave very few unanswered questions in a field where every answer only leads to several more questions.

1. Have an open mind
2. Get the Secret
3. Get What The Bleep

Through a set of smart reflections exposed for several personalities, you will be aware the first step is to think and make a list of your truly desires related with what you really want.

Following the traces of the famous writer Paolo Coelho, this film picks up and really works out as an indispensable beacon in the darkness for many hopeless and frustrated people who intends against the obstacles but with a new approach and perspectives when you assume the role of being the architect of yourself.

External motivation (say, from a motivational speaker or a seminar) is only temporary and probably the reason why people have to keep in touch with more of it.  However, for those that are internally motivated, by their OWN desires are always looking for ways to accomplish their goals.  those that plug into ""personal development"" probably succeed faster.  None-the-less, those that are internally motivated, make up the 3% of the population that know and practice the Law of Attraction.

Imagine combining both - firing up your subconscious mind (as it works 8 times faster than our conscious mind) on what you want to achieve and then putting that in writing and an action plan with goals to match it.

1607670,4,B00005JPJ8,"The book and the video are the two sides of the same coin and I would advise you to follow the one or the other. I will suggest though that you concentrate on the video because the commentary between the quotations are nothing but the proof that some people need a lot more explanations and a lot of paraphrase to understand the basic meaning. Are we all without limits? And that is going to be my very first remark. From my long experience I know that some people are physically handicapped, or mentally handicapped, or psychologically handicapped, or with many hurdles on their road and around them. You should see the state of some of those children born to deep alcoholics or drug addicts. Or  what about children with a severe genetic disparagement? And I refuse to say they are just disabled, or differently-abled. They are handicapped by being materialistically in their very body or mind at a disadvantage that will prevent them from doing what most people around them will be able to do. If the mind is intact, and working on positive thinking is the only way for these people, then they can compensate their physical limitations with their spiritual achievements. But you can't run in the standard Olympics without legs just like a bicycle will not run without wheels. And this time, in most of these situations, one will not be able to excel, full stop and period, and if one can excel in one particular field in which he is not or is less limited, it won't be without the help of other people around them. You cannot think positive if there is no signs along that road. The second remark is positive. Apart from these special cases, everyone, absolutely everyone can excel somewhere and that excellence can only be reached if it is targeted, looked for and built. Positive thinking, education, understanding that the pleasure of such achievements is in the goal when reached and not in the effort you have to accomplish, even if for those who will reach the highest points this very effort is a pleasure, the pleasure of the effort itself. A runner has to train day in and day out and that is never, absolutely never a plain entertaining phase of relaxation and abandon. Physical pleasure requires sweat and heart speed. But if one does not set their minds on the aim they are going to strive towards, they will never reach it. Success is enormously in the mind, in the conscious and subconscious motivation of the candidate. Yet it is absolutely false to say that man has no limits. Humanity, and every member of it, has always been limited historically and no one could think plasma physics or quantum computers under Julius Caesar. Each historical period produces its possible fields of investigation that are limited because in a later historical period those fields of investigation will always be vaster, larger, deeper, more intense. Or then the author is speaking metaphorically of man as the representative of humanity in its cosmic history. But that is not helping any individual who is striving to achieve something in his own life. Icarus did try to fly but wax wings were kind of primitive. Then my third and last remark will be a question: why only ONE percent of humanity controls NINETY-SIX percent of wealth? If this is a fact, and it is, it is the proof that all men are not equal in facts but only in rights, and that is so by our collective decision to say so. But one thing is sure: thinking negatively is never good. Think of McCain and Palin and their negative campaigning. Think of all the anarchists of the world who have never achieved the slightest beginning of their dream which is only a negative picture of the world the way it is. If you criticize the world systematically, then your dream becomes the inverted image of this world, hence a negative picture of reality, and that will never guide or inspire people into desiring such a future. When I don't like something I do not ask for the reverse. I wonder what the situation is, what the possibilities are and if another solution is possible and which one. Then I will think positively along that objective, or rather as objective as possible, line, but to demand black because what I don't like is white, or to require red because what I don't like is blue is primitive negative thinking. That kind of realism and collective striving is absent from this book or video and that is a shame because they forget attraction holds the world and the cosmos up because it is always counterbalanced by repulsion. Otherwise the moon would have fallen onto the earth a long very long time ago, even if this repulsion is itself the product of attractions that are standing abreast and against the attraction of the earth. The apple did not fall as long as the stem was strong enough and the apple light enough for the stem not to break. The author of this book or video seems to have forgotten that the cosmos is a complex system of opposed spheres and when a weak point appears, then a catastrophe develops in that weak point, and the earth is doomed sooner or later in cosmic time to disappear, just like the sun which will one day have burned all itself fuel.

I am aware of and very much believe in the Law of Attraction mostly from reading ""The Law of Attraction"" by Michael J. Losier. I found that book to be much more useful and provided a pragmatic realist approach to taking steps to turn what you want into what you have and not focusing so much on getting ""stuff"".

The Secret, unfortunately, just felt like a really-really-really long commercial, full of cheesy effects and theatrics, that was pitching something that they never got around to selling.  ""It worked for me, ""It worked for me too!"", ""Yes, it worked for me too!""-seemed to be the message throughout the video but the players never really got around to telling you HOW it worked for them and what they did to make it work. OK, a little maybe; make a vision board, focus on what you want......etc.  Losier's book (far less expensive too) gives you a plan, takes you through it, and shows you how to recognize results.

The Secret DVD left me wondering if I should have bought the book instead. What did I miss, was there more action to take in the book that wasn't covered in the DVD, etc.?

Overall, this is an important movie, for we're in a period of humankind's existence where perceived scarcity of resources will force us to either evolve as a species or perish. By evolve, I mean using a much higher share of our intellectual (and spiritual) capacity than at present. Critics, including adherents to the Law of Attraction, have Swiss Cheesed The Secret for pandering to the people's materialism, wanton lusts and venality.

And many have raised the oh-so-essential point that manifesting one's intentions is not merely a sit-back-in-your-La-Z-Boy-and-dream process -- as the movie might have you believe. Success is not easy. The movie is very light on the fact that most of us have to work our tails off to succeed.

But come on, lighten up, people -- all that's just marketing to get viewers thinking about the higher-level capabilities within them.

If you watch this movie and actually study it, you'll quickly realize that you must learn more, grow more and act more if you wish to materialize the paradisic visions shown in The Secret. (And of course, the idea is for you to learn, grow and act under the watchful tutelage and support of The Secret business organization. They are more than happy to supply you with videos, seminars and other ""product"" that might -- might -- help you to achieve some measure of life mastery.)

Part of the ""Secret to Money,"" it seems, is creating a huge sales and marketing apparatus to keep the money flowing in after they buy the video.

But back to the movie. It presents some quite intriguing and valid principles, including: 1) that everything, including matter, is reducible to energy; and 2) All of this energy is connected in an incomprehensibly large network (hmm, a Matrix?), meaning that everything and everyone is connected with everything else. If you accept this, it renders quite foolish the wars, struggles and competition we engage in daily. And it makes generosity and kindness seem like a no-brainer, if not downright self-serving.

And so now we're at something of a crossroads. Even as more people than ever are embracing the message of plentiful abundance and oneness (preached by Buddha, Jesus, Wallace D. Wattles, and many more), we find a world gripped in many places by greed, crisis and dysfunction. Here's hoping that The Secret, for all its flaws, can tip the scales so that humanity will move toward alleviating its own suffering. It will require ""the masses"" to awaken to the potential within themselves as individuals, and undergo the hard work of life mastery.",1223769600,,2804,4.915433403805497

The overall theme that I gathered from this book/video is that the mind is a very powerful tool, and with positive thinking, one can take on any goal he/she desires.  Though there may be some merit to that, people can take positive thinking to an extreme where they lose touch with reality.  That's not to say that negative thinking is the way to go.

1607723,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is a fantastic DVD and site - the first of it's type I have seen where some great people in the personal development world come together with a great script that makes you want to learn more...the secret is enticing.

Its set as a movie and an engaging commentary...much easier to understand and absorb than a book on the topic!

This is what they say about it:  ""The Secret is the culmination of many centuries of great thinkers, scientists, artists and philosophers. All of the people involved behind the scenes with The Secret are honored to stand on the shoulders of these great people cherishing the ideas that have come before us.

The Secret DVD is a thought-provoking documentary-style movie about manifesting and how to use the Law of Attraction to create whatever you want in your life.

What do you really want? Sometimes we focus our thoughts what we don't like in our life or what we don't want; this simply creates more of the same negative results.

The Secret movie helps you understand just how important it is to consciously choose the thoughts you hold each day; to keep your thoughts and actions focused on what you really want to attract into your life. It is all up to you. Take charge of your thoughts, and you'll take charge of your life.""

Please don't start thinking ""this is the same old B.S,"" and I won't bother to get this DVD or view the online movie...I promise you as someone who has read 100's books on the topic this is a really great and fun way about learning about `manifesting your destiny'.

I have used some of these principles again and again without really knowing it...once you realise what you are doing you can start to direct the real power of the universe.

I say ""suspend your disbelief"" and try it...if you are open minded enough to take in the ideas - which are presented in a really engaging way - you will benefit, I am positive!

The main thing is to take in the concepts and ignore any hype...

It features some interesting people like Dr. Denis Waitley, who used various aspects of The Secret in training Olympic athletes and Apollo astronauts to reach new heights of human endeavour. Best selling authors and philosophers including Bob Proctor, Michael Bernard Beckwith, Jack Canfield, Lisa Nichols, John Assaraf, James Ray and Dr. Joe Vitale, explain how they have created lives of phenomenal success utilizing The Secret.

Doctors in the fields of medicine and quantum physics explain the science behind The Secret.
The Secret reveals amazing real life stories and testimonials of regular people who have changed their lives in profound ways. By applying The Secret they present instances of eradicating disease, acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles and achieving what many would regard as impossible.

The Secret reveals how to apply this powerful knowledge to your life in every area from health to wealth, to success and relationships.

I watched a good portion of it, but I kept getting phone calls and other distractions so I finally gave up and put it away to finish another time.  The more I thought about the message in The Secret however, the more I thought it was a bunch of brainwashing drivel.  ""The Law of Attraction""--think about what you want and you'll get it.  ""Think abundance and you'll have abundance; think lack and you'll have lack.""  How ridiculous!  That's simply not how it works.  We don't exist in a vacuum.  There are other factors to consider--namely, that we were created by God to be in fellowship with Him and He has given us clear instructions in His Word(the Bible)to follow in order to have a full, wonderful, abundant life.  ""Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.  For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.""(Matthew 7:7,8 New American Standard Version)  Of course there is also God's perfect peace in all situations--good or bad--which He has given freely to us(John 14:27); He's told us we don't have to be anxious about anything(Philippians 4:6); and He's assured us that if we love Him, everything will turn out for our good(Romans 8:28).  So I say, skip The Secret and open your Bible instead.  It's not referred to as ""the Good Book"" for nothing!  If you don't have one, I recommend an annotated Bible which gives explanations of certain verses and cross references to other verses.  Above all, open yourself up to receiving God's blessings.  He has them for you and wants so badly to knock your socks off with His love, grace, mercy and goodness.  And that's no secret. ;)",1220745600,3,1773,4.595541401273885

They call it ""The Secret"".. and even though we all know these things (instinct, intuition, the bible, physics, etc), its difficult for anyone to assemble them in a pretty little package and use them in every day life. I have been following ""The Secret"" for years without knowing it. This movie sort of connected the dots and filled in the blanks. I'm a very intelligent, rational person and know this is the real deal. I have personally benefited from whats talked about and it does truly change your life.

The comments below are NEGATIVE. and in the movie itself it says that negativity attracts more negativity so if these people have that attitude they will get more of the same. Its just the laws of physics. This is not about money, this is about a spiritual journey to whatever you want in life (its true and it really works). If it were about money there would have been a blockbuster release, sex scenes, a plot, an ending, action, actors, etc.. This has none of the above. Just solid advice.

They create laws (the ""law"" of attraction) that is no more law than the ""law of my carpet cleaner"" and then use pieces of common knowledge, and quotes from famous people to give their ""laws"" credibility. The funny thing is - those same people they are quoting would never agree with the shallow and twisted meaning the producers are attributing to them.

Yes, there are some positive things (mostly things you already know) but that is part of the snake oil salesman strategy. They use common, positive knowledge, to get people to start nodding their heads, and when the watcher (or reader) goes on, lots of plain lies start getting thrown in there - in a very deceptive manner and sandwiched between real common knowledge.

I've put to practice the principles in this film and have already seen many weird things show up in my life. I experimented some on cash with a figure of 1800 for fun. And roughly 6 months later a little over 1800$ from someone i don't even know from another country showed up in my mail box.  I didn't sell the guy anything either. It was from nowhere for absolutely no reason.  I can't even begin to grasp how this happened...  Still, this drives me nuts trying to figure it out. My mouth just hangs open in awe when i do. When i try to contact the person to thank them it is returned and they don't even exist. This blows my mind. And i am not exagerating, nor am i lying. This junk really works if you do it right. It gets complicated at times, but i'm getting better at this.  Just do what it says in the video and i'd recommend you buy some other books on the law of attraction to supplement your education to perfect it.  This principle in life is the most important lesson you could ever learn in life so do NOT take it with a grain of salt or else you will screw yourself up.  Jump in with blind faith.. that is the only way. If you aren't seeing results than you aren't looking hard enough at the big picture.  If you are affraid of being taken as ""gullible"" then practice it often without telling anyone so you don't have to think about what people think of you. I felt like that too at first.  Don't worry about it, it will pass if you keep up with it, especially as you begin to see weird things happen.  Like the movie says.. you must believe before you see.. and therefore if you don't believe, you will be shown all the reasons as to why it doesn't work.. cuz this is your belief, and that is what will generate the evidence.. thus implementing the ""law of attraction"" without you even knowing it. heh. I know you want to see before you believe, but it just does not work that way with this. you can't be a skeptic to get it to work.
As for the movie in how it was made i really thought they did a nice job. If i could change anything about it I would have made the film much longer for more details and examples and ""how-to"" advice.  This movie serves more as an introduction to intermediate level. But it's definately worth every $.  I'd spend 10x as much for this movie than the retail price suggested here. If it generates millions for me, how can I really put a price on this?

I had been working overtime for months and was in pretty lousy condition at the time. Then i watched it again and became reminded of these little coincidents that we all experience, but can't put our finger on. In short: i can honestly say that it does work. But it can take some time to change thought patterns you have been walking in for years. It feels stupid to write this, but the movie actually just reminds us of things we already know, deep down. But we keep forgetting it because of the limitations we impose on ourselves. Of what is right, and what is wrong.

I am fully aware that the concept of attraction is just one of many (it is also called the law of love). But what impressed me with this product is how clearly it defined the boundaries we deal with. It is practical rather than idealistic. Also, it is a breath of fresh air, concidering the avalanche of negative ""truth"" movies that has surfaced over the past few years.

We need movies like these to remind us that life is good. We have a tendency to put up a wall to protect ourselves from stress and harm. But that same wall also isolates us from everything we hold dear. Including the divine.

I believe The Secret and Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life will give you a more complete understanding about the sabotage phenomenon.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Change-Your-Thinking-Change-Your-Life/dp/B000UHUPRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life</a>",1211760000,,790,6.392523364485982
1607992,1,B00005JPJ8,"the poster below me gave a far more eloquent review than I can, but anyway I'd heard alot about The Secret and wanted an easy way to see what it's about so decided to borrow the dvd.

Not only is the production value sooo low budget and cheesy (check out the opening credit's montage), but their idea that the world can create peace and love by just collectively thinking about peace and love is naive and ridiculous. They go so far as to say by watching the news we are magically creating more turmoil, come on!!

How come I've been wishing with all my heart to meet prince charming since i was like 13, really believing it would happen (honestly), and all I ever get is jerks and bums?

If The Secret was really true, we'd all be millionaires and geniuses. Fact is, if you haven't been born into wealth or connections, or are genetically-impaired in the looks or brains department, then you'll have a hard time creating a perfect life from just believing it will happen magically. Other people don't do your bidding for you and make you a star either, people have their own agenda in mind. Just my two bits...i wonder if anyone who's read this book actually had something miraculous happen.",1211673600,2,1192,4.534883720930233

I have always believed that  illnesses are mostly psychological and you can usually tell why your head aches or your stomach hurts. And it is true that when you really want something you usually get it.

However, I feel that the video emphasizes too much on materialism, like ""if you really want that necklace, visualize yourself as if you already had it"". I guess a lot of people care too much about wealth, but some of us don't really associate happiness with diamond necklaces!

Anyway it doesn't hurt to watch this video, it makes you want to be more optimistic about life in general and even though I only watched it once, it comes to my mind whenever negative thoughts start haunting me hehe",1210896000,,810,4.65034965034965

Utter common advice, rephrased and packaged as some sort of mystical secret, along with the utmost simple-minded populist message imaginable:  everything you could ever want, free...and of course without effort.

And what would simpletons want, if they had command of the entire universe, which supposedly they do? Why a new car, of course...and a dream house...and lots and lots of money.

And there are lots of pictures of money, and expensive cars, and million dollar homes.

Those words go directly inside your brain, your soul and your heart and no matter what happen in your life, you just have to reach for those words within yourself to find not only inner peace and being better armed for bad situations, but what is even more amazing those words give you the keys to attract with your own positive thinking all you want in life.

I do not know what my future holds - But, I do know who holds my future</a>

I was introduced to the book ""The Secret"" in 2006 and had an opportunity to view teachers of ""The Secret"" on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2007.

After the tragic death of my husband in 2001, I suffered from depression and carried much anger.  I made a decision to not allow anyone in my life who caused me pain.  That meant removing the negative from my life and focusing on the positive.

When I began reading ""The Secret,"" I related well to the teaching presented.  The early stages of writing ""My Secret Journal,"" involved not only reading ""The Secret,"" I watched the DVD and listened to the audio.

My enthusium increased when I applied the teaching and found that when I consistantly focused on the good, that is what I got.  It is very easy to be negative in a negative situation.

When you find something positive in a negative thought or situation, you begin to view life from both sides.  When you embrace the things that you are grateful for in a negative atmosphere, your life begins to change for the better and you seek new and higher ways to raise yourself to a higher level.

Previously, I read the book ""God Meant It for Good"" by R.T. Kendall.  Combining the wisdom and knowledge I received from both books allowed me to look at life differently.  I viewed each challenge and disappointment as a strength builder and a stepping stone to raise me to a higher level.

For all the people who rated ""The Secret"" with a One, Two or Three star rating, do yourself a favor and not only read ""The Secret"" again, combine it with my book, ""My Secret Journal.""

""My Secret Journal"" by Janet Grillo & You (Your Story Begins Here) is a valuable tool for you to discover more of your inner self.

Reading and digesting the content of ""The Secret"" is excellent way to begin your journey.

By journalizing your journey, combined with the wisdom learned in reading ""The Secret,"" you will begin to write ""Your Own Story.""

Soon you will become a stepping-stone to help others succeed.

What a way to make a living . . .

In gratitude & joy,
Janet Grillo",1207440000,,2392,4.9325

If it is not working for you, watch it again until you get it right.  People never really question why there is so much negativity in their lives and how they bring things about through their own negative thoughts.  If they truly understood this, there lives would change.  Using the secret, I have brought into my life my soul mate, a home, a car and a job.

But if you take this and use it, it simply works.

Spend time criticizing it, or spend time testing it... Which would a wise man do?

I tested it, and increased my personal income by 100% putting my household's income well into the 6 figure range in 18 months.

An indisputable fact:

People who are successful attract what they need. This product offers an explanation for that truth, and a simple method for harnessing and producing results with it.

People who love it obviously got the message.

More than positive thinking. Much more than magical foolishness. The law of attraction is taught by many success stories... look at the personal histories of people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Henry Ford, or any other success story and you will see CLEARLY. They attracted what they needed in order to accomplish something larger than themselves...

Napoleon Hill has offered information like this wrapped in a different package. It comes in the form of a BEST SELLING book ""Think and Grow Rich"".

Robert Kiyosaki offers techniques to make one think properly about money in order to create more...
Like his ""Rich Dad"" said: ""Take it or leave it."" The choice that offers the highest potential for return is to take it.

Anthony Robins talks about the power of Focus all the time. Look at what he has accomplished in his lifetime!

The best part of all the negative attention this product is getting is the finest irony.

Every knucklehead that posts a bad review about this only creates controversy, which will sell more of these because intelligent people want to know for themselves, and if you say something is bad, without demonstrating it, it has the reverse effect of peaking curiosity...

The law of attraction states ""what you focus on you will get""...

So the bone heads trying to shoot this product down just ""KEEP FOCUSING"" on this by ""trying to stamp it out"" and its fans just keep growing because of all the noise that is being created.

That in and of itself demonstrates that what is being taught in this product is the truth...

A very good friend introduced me to The Secret and I went home and ordered it almost 2 years ago now.  While the DVD has value, the tools and methods could be used better with regard to building a life or facing challenges.  The following is what I've learned.

Life is a complex thing, even for experienced masters and ""old souls"".  It's very easy to be born and get lost, never to have discovered your true purpose in this life.  The one huge KEY that was left out (exept for one brief statement) is ""alignment with your Souls purpose"" in life.  The tools and methods, if you can identify with them, could be used to align yourself with your ""higher purpose"" and then fulfill it usiing these practices.  You can ask, believe and receive all you want to, but it won't happen IF you are not in tune with your role, mission or purpose in life.  If your ""ego"" is asking for an expensive sports car to impress someone so you can move up in ""class"" in society, that's fine (for some this is their purpose this life), but what is more likely to come into fruition is the ""need"" for a car or transportation to get to work to earn money to take care of my family or to find the resources our community organization needs so that pain and suffering is reduced and our community can raise it's happiness level.

Fundamentally, another point not discussed is what you can remove from your life in order to be ""more"" of what you want to become, kind of like the artist sculptpor who chips the stone away until a masterpiece has formed.  Certain situations and people can be ""toxic"" and harmful and it takes discipline to ""know it"" and change it for personal peace and health.  By removing what we dislike, sometimes, this can be more beneficial than ""adding more"" to an already complex situation in life.

Personally, the great thing about the DVD IS the positive message, tools for creating ""something from nothing"" and developing a disciplined mind, but a more altruistic approach with communal consideration versus individual ""desires"" would be truly beneficial, especially in the times we now find ourselves in. It is an ""inspiring"" DVD that has a 100% positive message, it is though clear the mind set of the production team, but YOU can use this for any life purpose to achieve goals.",1205884800,,2508,4.55902004454343

I do not believe the brain has special powers (though I do know that we emit brain waves and people could sense our emotions) to make a car appear, but having the desire, faith and putting your plan into action in getting that car is what makes it happen.

For a video that has a cast of physicists, philosophers, etc... there's nothing philosophical about it, to the point you start to wonder if these are paid infomercial specialists posing as competent people in their field. This video truly is for the masses, for the broadest audience possible, as one can immediately tell in the first 5 minutes as it appeals to one's materialistic desires and narcissism. Someone who can enjoy this video without feeling insulted would be better off reading Christopher Lasch's ""The culture of narcissism, America in an age of diminishing expectations"". That would be a lot more helpful. It's one thing to realise one's wish, it's another to know where our desires and wishes originate from and why. The world will be a better place when people have greater awareness, not when each individual find new ways or ""the secret"" to pursue one's selfish desires. Shame on the so call philosophers, theologian, physicists who participated in this video and bagged the money... They will lose my respect when I next see them in much more spiritual, artistic, beautiful and non-profit documentaries such as ""Gaia Symphony"" by Jin Tatsumura and to a much lesser extent ""What the Bleep Do We Know...""",1205366400,3,1426,4.945833333333334

People who are depressed, unhappy and clueless about their lives, it is a starting point for them. Helps one believe in their own abilities. The basic premise I took from it, ""If one is focused with a positive attitude and keeps at it, surely they will succeed"".

1608295,1,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is a misnomer, it should be entitled ""The Seduction.""  The so-called law of attraction is nothing new. This wishful thought has been around for eons, and many have reaped its monetary rewards by preying on suckers, that is! It's a beautiful concept (for the authors), if you don't attract, it's YOUR fault, not the ""laws'"" fault. This way they can (and will) sell you more books, DVDs, and seminar/workshops to help you perfect the Law.  Huh, if it's a Law, why should you have to work so hard at it?  I don't have to work hard at any of Newton's Laws, but, anyway....

How the ""secret"" works?  Simple, some people are more adept at getting what they want and they get it, happens all the time, but the majority of us are NOT so adept.  The adept are the ones who tout such nonsense, believing that the ""secret"" (or the ""law"") was responsible.  Not everyone can get what they want, and NO ONE can choose what they want. That could be said to be a law.  How??  Simple, if you have a want, how does that want come about?  Why do you want what you want?  If you trace it back, you will find that the want just came out of nowhere, meaning not due to YOUR choosing.

Whether a want (or desire) is fulfilled is also not up to you.  Just like the want or desire was not of your choosing, whether or not it is fulfilled is not up to you.  I do know that those who have plotted, planned, and performed will say they have done it, but the truth is what allowed them to follow-through is the same thing that allowed others to flounder.  Is it hopeless for those who flounder?  No.  Just because you have followed-through does not mean you will continue to and just becuase you have floundered it does not mean you will continue to flounder.  You have to continue to live to find out.  Still, whether you fulfill or flounder, it will not be because of some ""secret"" or some ""law of attraction"" but simply because you happened to be a certain way at a certain time (not of your individual choice).

Example, many have said they will lose weight.  Few do.  Those who do, like, say, Oprah, will claim a lot of psycho-babble.  But the big O has done it a couple of times, at least, and look at her round self now.  Many swear that THIS time they will do and they don't.  Some swear it and do it, and they're the ones who go around saying you have to attract it, or you just have to set your mind to it.  Okay.  But whether you set your mind to it, or do not, is not up to you, nor some ""secret.""

The picture is a lot bigger than us.  We like to believe we are the center of the Universe, but there is not us AND the Universe.  We ARE Universe (part of it), we are Earth.  There is no mankind and mother Nature, there is Earth! Universe! And it does what it does, and that is all.

1608296,5,B00005JPJ8,"AMAZING and INSPIRING!  The Secret needs to be watched more than once.  First time I watched it I thought ""Wow.  Yeah, that sounds great.""  It hit a chord.  But I didn't start to visualize, etc. on a regular basis.  Watched it again and the chord was struck again and something resonated deep within me.  NOW I visualize daily, imagine dreams and goals coming to fruition and pay no mind to the HOW of it all.  One way or another that will be presented to me.  Doesn't mean you should just sit around for all that you want to come to you.  But everything begins with a thought and the more you think the right thoughts then sooner or later you are going to get up off your chair and start making things happen with the help of the God/the Universe.  Important thing is to remain in the right state of mind.  Read books about the Law of Attraction, read inspirational stories, watch The Secret over and over.  Like the video says ""you have to have a hunger"" for what you want.  Which is something that I never let myself develop for fear of failure--I think many of us can relate to that.  We fear getting emotionally involved with or own dreams and goals because we are scared that if we do fail then the pain of it will be that much greater.  All that does is make us fail from the onset.  But like the Spanish proverb says ""VIVIR CON MIEDO ES COMO VIVIR A MEDIAS""--to live a life in fear is to live a life half lived.

After all, don't we have to keep sending thoughts out to the Universe?
The beginning of the DVD states, ""Little did I know that out of my greatest despair would be my greatest gift.""

Everybody wants more happiness in theirs lives. But this is not going to do it. Sadly the secret is that you will be exposed to convoluted and repetative jingles and sayings that might make you feel better for a moment or two but leave you with nothing to work with to truely improve the quality of your life.

There are a lot of unrelated facts, some true, that can not be tied together in the real world in any fashion but in the secret they attempt that feat and try to sell you as it being a concise, factual, and linear truth. Even though there is no connection between these facts,logicaly,scientificaly, phylosophicaly, or spirutualy the secret attempts to join all of these unrelated ideas into another think your way to riches pipe dream. As one critic put it, nothing more than a info-mertial. The secret information will leave you with more questions and frustrations than true solutions.

The secret is more mind over matter jibberish that does not pass the test of time. Sure positive thinking is better and healthier than negative thinking but the whole thing is nothing more than old stuff rehashed.

The crass materialism that the secret suggests as a reward for accepting and practicing their idea is an insult and to any one who is on a true search for meaningfull happiness. No thinker from Aristotle to todays leading thinkers in physics have ever proposed such a simplistic and outrages notion as this secret. This is where the secret truely falls short as anything leading to happiness, its appeal to the materialistic fiber in your body.

Faith without action is futile. We have had so many think your way to happiness and riches proponents that have lined their pockets by selling that fantasy and leaving the readers a few dollars poorer. That is the true secret.

People respond to kindness, love, my positive outlook, and my happiness--all things knowing ""The Secret"" and applying the Law of Attraction every day brought to my life.

I read the book first and loved it.  The DVD gave me a chance to further anchor the ideas and to see the teachers who are in the book.  Some of the scenes in it were a little too ""cute"" or contrived, but they were in there to try to get a valid point across.

Some people are too critical and too hard on this DVD and the whole idea that you can attract what you want through what you think and how you act.  What's wrong with thinking love instead of hate. abundance instead of lack, and working proactively instead of being against everything?  The people who react so negatively to the movie are precisely the people who need it the most.

Rhonda Byrne comes right out and lists many of the people through the ages who knew ""The Secret"" which is really the Law of Attraction.  She never maintains that ""The Secret"" is something she invented or made up.  The reason it's called ""The Secret"" isn't because it is a secret, but because the Law of Attraction is the secret to living happily and with an abundance of good things of many kinds.

I know the concept of the Law of Attraction seems hard to believe, but I've seen it work good and bad ways in my own life.  Now that I know how to use the law, I'm living a much richer life in so many ways.",1200009600,4,1544,4.2646048109965635

1608776,3,B00005JPJ8,"For those of us who have been around for a while, ""The Secret"" really isn't much of a secret.  Instead it is a compendium of positive thoughts with some ersatz quantum physics backing to make its whole premise seem scientific rather than new age.

I do buy Ms Byrne's initial thinking; being depressed about life's miseries does cause inertia that leads to a search within oneself.  I liken her quest for the so-called truth akin to thoughts that I myself had when my mother passed away over ten years ago.  Feeling one's mortality leads to the bigger question of `what's it all about, anyway?' and this focus can either enlighten or demoralize.  In Ms Byrne's case it seems to have facilitated a way for her to subsidize her bank account substantially.  Like most inherently healthy people, she chose to anesthetize the bad feelings of dread, doubt and fear by substituting them with sensations that moved her forward in life.  Good for her and if it helps to put you on a positive track, why not?

Sadly, positive doesn't begin to describe how most people react to life. Complaining now qualifies as a national pastime.  On average, I can honestly say that the majority of people I have met use their negative past experiences to hover over their lives and mark their futures with an all-encompassing shadow that puts Job to shame and keeps all those psychoanalysts in their million dollar homes and foreign cars.  What good does looking into the past do?  Learning from or identifying one's source of pain doesn't mean that said angst becomes magically diminished; the only way to assuage anxiety entails a concentration on some other constructive activity.  Wallowing and worrying that history will repeat itself just doesn't keep the half glass full enough to quench our parched throats.

And that is what it really is all about--keeping the glass half full rather than empty with a simple and effective philosophical shift.  Forgive the hackneyed philosophy, but all the great minds reiterate this same basic idea in a variety of ways--just read the quotations that regal each of ""The Secret's"" main segments and forget about the trendy Da Vinci Code lead-in designed to make you think that the term ""Secret"" has anything to do with conspiracy theories and the like rather than a direct way of asking the winners of this world what the `secret' to their success entailed.  All the victors chant the same mantra: think positive thoughts that make you feel good and goal realization will follow.

Byrne cleverly assembles her panel of experts to reflect successful, happy entrepreneurial types that live lives about which most people dream.  In particular,  Jack Canfield's (author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series ) remarks resonate simply because his demeanor suggests a very happy camper that eagerly and willingly relates his tale of accomplishment as an average everyman who envisioned personal triumph and achieved it by acting on a good idea.  Some of the other panel members did not register as highly on my recognition scale; many of them I know only because of their appearance en masse on the Oprah Winfrey segment regarding the film.

My beefs with this presentation have little to do with the actual premise.  I can find little fault with something so elementary and positive.  Simple thinking to me always seems the most profound; Christ himself advised in his enigmatic way, `to seek and ye shall find.'  Some may say that the film focuses on the acquisition of money or rather silly materialistic targets, but if you look beyond the actual goals and realize that the filmmaker looks only to illustrate common examples of such desires, you can see beyond the triviality and bundle all such ends, great and small, as attainable according to the power of positive thinking or as defined in the film as ""the law of attraction.""  Whether or not the ""law of attraction' has anything to do with quantum physics, I have not expertise with which to comment.  Most likely the idea of the quantum world and the mind updates the timelessness of the original premise for the newer audience of this century.

Some will say that the film's idea of becoming a mini-god in one's own sphere of influence or mini-universe suggests the retirement or denial of God.  I don't believe that this is the film's intent.  More probably, the emphasis on self widens the sphere of influence of the film itself---the idea then becomes more appealing and marketable to believers and non-believers alike.

Bottom line?  Does ""The Secret"" really relate a true secret?  For the most part, no.  Its Earl Nightingale's ""Strangest Secret"" rebundled to reflect a world that needs scientific validity for even the simplest thoughts.  Nevertheless, I will recommend it as it does promote good conversation afterwards, bringing into the light issues both profound and mundane.

1608778,4,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is both a disappointment and also a good but incomplete presentation of Law of Attraction, therefore we are giving ""The Secret"" a 5 minus 1 rating.

Disappointing because:
D1. Over and unnecessarily hyped.
D2. Perhaps it was hoping to attract the masses, and thus explaining the approach that ""The Secret"" was presented, mixed of good and bad (materialism), and thus, pleasing some, while upsetting others.
D3. It WAS perhaps secret, but for those in the know, it is NOT a secret.

Nice because:
N1. The authors tried their best make the message appealing to the masses, which would otherwise be less attractive if presented using a philosophical approach.
N2. Interesting life examples - would prefer if the life examples can be verified.
N3. Nice compilation of relevant quotations, sighted here: www  . mcuniverse  . com /The-Law-of-Attraction. 1306.0 . html

Incomplete because:
Law of Attraction is a much more extensive nature than was presented in ""The Secret""...
(a) Attraction can be in the form of proactive, neutral or passive
(b) Time element was not well presented, effects can come in seconds, days, years or even lifetimes.
(c) etc.

1608782,5,B00005JPJ8,"I first bought the 2006 edition (the second one), watched it, and felt that there was something missing.  I started studying New Thought authors, like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Wallace Wattles, Thomas Troward, Charles Haanel, and quantum physicist Einstein, James C Maxwell, Brian Greene and metaphysics. But when I bought Esther Hicks/Abraham books and cds, that's when I realized that what they were teaching was the missing element.

I am so happy to locate the ***original*** The Secret DVD, and because Esther Hicks was in it, she was able to teach people HOW the Law of Attraction works, and HOW you activate it in your life, and HOW you receive it.

This was the missing piece in the 2nd edition (2006 version).

This type of info is not new. But, what IS NEW is how Abraham teaches us ** HOW ** to receive, how to focus, and what WE focus on (good or bad), that's what we get in our lives.

Did you know that when Napoleon Hill wrote ""Think and Grow Rich"", his editors/publishers believed that ""thoughts are vibrations, thoughts are energy, thoughts are the creative force"" was too radical for its time, and deleted them from the books?  I forget which Secret teacher purchased the original Napoleon Hill draft.

And after the original edition of The Secret DVD, Esther Hicks was informed that they have to delete the words ""thoughts are vibrations"" and energy from the DVD or be edited out?

Quantum mechanics, quantum physics, metaphysics are all proving the Law of Attraction is truth.  Esther Hicks and Abraham teaches HOW to use this law and put ourselves in alignment with Source (the Almighty Creator), and learn about how to receive. For more information, go to [...]

1608783,5,B00005JPJ8,"I am totally blown away by the large number of negative, and really mean-sounding reviews that are here, slamming this book/DVD.
There is a medium, Esther Hicks, who is able to channel a group of non-physical beings who call themselves ""Abraham"", and basically Abraham's teachings are what you will find in ""The Secret"", ie. The Law of Attraction, only in a more physical-human orientation.
I heard a seminar by Abraham, and an angry woman demanded to know: ""If I'm asking, (and I AM)....and the Universe is answering (and that's YET to be seen), ....then where the hell is my STUFF?""  And Abraham pointed out to her that in her anger and frustration, she was shutting off the stream of what she wanted, and attracting more anger and frustration.
A lot of the negative reviewers here sound like this woman. They are negative, attract negative experiences, and so they ""tell it like it is"" with more negativity. Such negative reviews don't serve you.
There are a lot of people who are upbeat, and therefore attract more of that. When such people use this law, the results can be breathtaking.  If you're going to listen to anybody in life, listen to the WINNERS.  Positive people are able to make this work with very little effort.  And as for the negative people? Once they get that chip off their shoulders, it'll work for them, too, if they choose.
The DVD version is a wonderful way to quickly grasp the process. I recommend it.

This movie has helped me to understand why every time my wife and I have planned a 2 to 3 month vacation, our businesses go absolutely CRAZY busy just weeks before we leave. We have always planned these trips not knowing how we were going to pay (in advance) for them. We've done this for the past nine years. And without exception, the needed money to ""pull it off"" has always been there. Almost every trip we have taken is without communication back home. Like backpacking all over Central America several times. Everything that is going to break on our 13 rental properties, either breaks before we leave or very shortly after we return. In our Auto Repair and Sales business, the customers cars never break while we are gone and warranty issues on resale cars are non-existent, even though make arrangements for that possibility. We've never understood why this has always worked for us, but we quickly learned to trust it. Actually we just learned to intended it. This Movie ""The Secret"" didn't really say anything that we hadn't heard before. It just put it in to a perspective that allowed us to more utilize what we already knew. My wife and I have a model relationship, it is now even better. I wouldn't have thought it could have gotten better, but it has. We hadn't realized, but we had become slightly fragmented in our businesses (Now we have three businesses) and our relationship. It has helped us to focus even more on our relationship and what we want out of life. I've read some of the LESS than positive reviews. I think many of them are insightful in their own ways.

1608932,2,B00005JPJ8,"Considering the number of positive reviews I reviewed the film on the companies website. [...] . At first, during the first quarter of the film I considered a 3 star review but my enthusiasm quickly waned. I wasn't even enthusiastic toward the opening sequence. From the producers prospective, I was skeptical about their motivations. My skepticism was confirmed. And that was solidified when they brought out the women with breast cancer who miraculously healed herself by watching nothing but comedy on her television for three months. Please... that women LIED through her teeth.

The video talks about visualizing techniques of a positive nature. But I don't recommend this movie. For anyone with a background in positive affirmation and visualization, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-of-Positive-Thinking/dp/1416560610/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power of Positive Thinking</a>&nbsp;by Norman Vincent Peale especially for the young.

The movie is led by many doctors, metaphysicians, philosophers, business people, authors: John Gray (Mars, Venis) series and Chicken Soup for the Soul etc...

The movie had some techniques that can help a young person visualize their goals. I'll save you the time. One of the authors who prides himself on building many companies created himself a ""Vision Board"" by cutting and pasting the things he wanted on a cork board as a constant reminder of the things he desired or maybe wanted to be like.

Positive imagery is good. But at the same time enough pathetic and even disgusting imagery was used it made you want to tune it out. There are many quotes from successful and intellectual people. For example, ""whatever the mind can conceive, the body can achieve""

The movie doesn't discredit the Bible and uses quotes from it saying their language is essentially the same but spoke in different terms. In that case, your better off with the Bible. Mother Theresa was given a few seconds in the film. But it was simply more positive concerns for an already too long film.

1608933,4,B00005JPJ8,"It looks like a lot of people watched this DVD but many were NOT ready to recieve ""The Secret (apparent by all the 1 star reviews).""  The DVD itself is motivational and inspiring, though I belive it is missing some important details about implementing the Law of Attraction (the reason for only 4 stars).  This is a good start (and if it inspires you), then I would suggest reading Napoleon Hill's (Think and Grow Rich) and Wallace D. Wattles (The Science of Getting Rich).  Then if you really want to continue studies, pick up Charles F. Haanel's Master Key System.  If you do not find any of this literature motivating, then put it away and try again in 5 years.  You have to be ""ready"" for this, in order to UNDERSTAND it.

I started my studies of the Law of Attraction when I picked up Napoleon Hill 3 years ago.  At the time, I found myself ""rock-bottom"" after already tasting success.  Half-way through ""Think and Grow Rich,"" I cried.  I felt a rush of enlightenment, like a switch turned on in my head.  Since then I've been on a constant study of this philosophy, as it has changed my life for the better.

1608935,5,B00005JPJ8,"When I rented The Secret, I thought it was an adventure story, but it turned out to be a self-help documentary about the power of positive thinking and creative visualization.

I've been putting into practice many of the suggestions given to create a more positive frame of mind. Going through a 'Things I'm Grateful For' in my life has improved my daily opinion of my existence. This in turn, creates good will in me, sends out good will to others, and sends opportunities back to me. A Win-Win situation for me and everyone around me.

I also thought I knew what I wanted in life. But in constructing a 'Vision Board' as one of the suggestions in the documentary, I realized I'd change a lot less in my life than I thought I would. And my vision of my future was cloudy at best. A vision board, a visual aid for 'seeing' what I want in my life has also revealed to me the bad beliefs I have about money. I grew up with 'Money is the root of all evil' hammered into me. No wonder money eludes me. I'm training myself to realize that money is nuetral. What people do with it can be good, or evil.

The info in The Secret isn't new or revolutionary. It parallels 'Creative Visualization', a book by Shakti Gawain I read a few years ago. But combined with the knowledge in The Secret that our brainwaves are physical things that influence the world around us put a very fine point on the need for postive visualization about my life. The Law of Attraction made a lot of sense to me and, for me, was like a key that opened my mind about my own future.

I plan to buy a copy of The Secret and play it as 'background music' while I'm working so I can continue to soak up the ideas of this self help documentary and continue to improve my life. I'm not sure why some people hate this movie. The info might not work for them, but hate it? I must admit, the previews of the documentary are misleading. It's not an adventure movie, but for me, a very mind opening, self-help documentary.",1195344000,2,1978,4.294906166219839

1608995,5,B00005JPJ8,"I understand the type of audience the movie was trying to reach: the layman, the average working person, the soccor mom or the banker next door.  The movie does present a profound, universal truth.  Anyone who says otherwise is just not focusing their energy correctly.

That said, the delivery of this truth is what is turning most people off.  It DOES seem like an infomercial, like they're ""selling you"" the Secret.  But, they do go into detail of how to use the secret to attract what you want in your life.  Unfortunately, they don't go deeply into WHY it works, and I think that alone made a lot of people skeptical.

If you want to understand why the ""law of attraction"" works, please read James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy, The 10th Insight, and The Secret of Shambhala.  (Especially the last one of those three, though that's the order of progression.)  The Secret of Shambala goes into detail of how all humans are constantly emitting an energetic ""prayer field"" of intention - the type of energy you give out, is exactly what you will draw in.  So if it's something based on fear, your fears usually become your reality.  With this background of knowledge, the Secret was a lot easier to digest and understand.

So, in short: GREAT message.  MEDIOCRE presentation.

But it may serve as a good starting place for a lot of people in taking responsibility for their own health, wealth, happiness, and self-awareness.  That, and that alone, is the reason we are here.  So if this DVD helps someone achieve a higher state of awareness, then that alone makes it priceless.  And that's why I'm giving it 5 stars, despite its few shortcomings.",1194998400,,1652,4.7403508771929825
1608996,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is a great DVD and the book is even better! All the negative reviewers are missing the point.  Sure the creators of the DVD and the book took some creative liberties to make it more interesting to viewers and readers, but take a look at the underlying message and you will see that most successful people use ""The Secret"" whether they know it or not.

For example, Bill Gates became the richest man in the world in spite of all the people that told him his ""windows"" idea was ludicrous and that the computer would never be a common household appliance.  I would guess that about 90% of the people who will read this review will read it from their home computer running a Windows operating system.  Did Bill Gates work hard to get where he's at now? Absolutely, but if you have ever seen an interview with Bill Gates, you'd know that he enjoyed every step of the way.  He couldn't help but be successful because he thought of nothing else but success as he built the Microsoft Empire.  He has now ""attracted"" the people and situations that continue to bring him more and more success.

If you need another example, watch Gene Simmons' Family Jewels.  There's a man who has achieved success beyond that of any rock star of our time and yet he enjoys life to the fullest.  Once again, watch an interview with him and you'll see someone who never envisions anything other than success.

I could go on and on pointing out success stories, but the point I'm trying to make is that successful people are successful because they do not allow thoughts of failure to dominate their thinking.  That's what this DVD and the book are all about.  I doubt seriously that Bill Gates, Gene Simmons or many other ultra successful people I could mention have read or seen ""The Secret"", but take a look at anyone successful after viewing this DVD and/or reading the book and I assure you that you'll see how that person applies ""The Secret"" to his/her life.  Sure there's nothing really new here. Positive thinking brings positive situations.  Anyone who has ever read a self-help book has seen it before, but this DVD and book put it in a format that really makes the reader understand.  If you're looking for an inexpensive yet very motivational boost to get your life going in the right direction, then this DVD is your answer.  And so what if you apply everything the DVD and book teaches and all your dreams don't come true overnight.  Is it so bad to be grateful for what you have now and think positive thoughts about the future?  That is the underlying principle of ""The Secret"".  At the very least, you'll be a better person for others to be around.

As for all the negative reviewers of ""The Secret"" that say this stuff doesn't work.  They're right.  It doesn't.  Not for them.  And it never will so long as those negative thoughts dominate their thinking.",1194912000,2,2851,4.555992141453831

1609000,2,B00005JPJ8,"I had some friends who were interviewed for The Secret video but weren't shown on it and they just couldn't wait to have me watch it.  I did watch it and I found some of the stories inspiring.  However, I also found the program to be incomplete and I think it can also be damaging to some viewers.

Rhonda Byrne says that all you need is three things and you can have absolutely anything you want.  You need to Ask, Believe and then Receive.

If only life were that simple.

Remember when you were a child and you thought you could get anything you wanted just by wishing for it?  I do.  I asked for many things.  I believed I would get them.  And sometimes I did and sometimes I did not.

Later in life I learned as many people do that you can dramatically improve your chances of getting what you want by taking action.

At least one other person on The Secret program actually said you need to take action but this was cut from the video except for Michael Beckwith's statement.  But Joe Vitale (who is on the video) says you need to take action and that seemed to be cut from the version I watched.

I've read Jack Canfield's book ""The Power of Focus"" in which he and his co-author Mark Victor Hansen talk about many of the creative strategies they used to market their book Chicken Soup for the Soul--turning it into a mega international best-seller.

But on The Secret Rhonda Byrne makes it seem as if taping a ""$1,000,000"" bill to his ceiling and other ""manifesting"" strategies were all it took for him to create his super-successes.

The best part of this video is the story of the man who had a horrible accident.  The doctors said he would never speak, never breathe on his own, never move or walk again.  He determined to keep his mind focused on recovery.  And he credits his mental focus with healing him by Christmas of that year.

I actually believe this story to be credible.  Many people have used their minds to heal their bodies and overcome illnesses that medical science said were incurable.  In my opinion this doesn't prove that we have the mental power to control the universe.  It does show that our minds have a powerful influence over our bodies.

But it fails to explain so many other universal laws which are equally important for manifestation  of  heart desires. For example, some people cannot manifest their desires after using  their imagination and all manifestation tools.because the law of karma(cause and effect)is in action.

1609003,5,B00005JPJ8,"There is a saying that, ""when the student is ready, the teacher arrives.""  I have read a great deal of self-help, positive thinking, spiritual guidance, holistic living, psychology, etc.., throughout my life.  Wherever I was along the path, what was there to help me at that time, usually did when I was ready for it.  Sometimes I was not ready for what later became obvious to me.  If people do not find anything of value in The Secret, it is because they are not ready.  I have recently come through another phase of my life when I felt very stuck.  Having done so much of the ""digging,"" I at first felt I was tired of it, I should have ""arrived,"" I should not have to do this any more.  I first became aware of The Secret several months ago, but I was still blocked.  My reaction was, oh sure more Positive Thinking, Believing It Makes It So, blah blah.  This fall I had a transformative jolt that showed me I was projecting a huge amount of fear and negativity into a particular area of my life.  It is too long and too personal to tell - but I will just say, it was shown to me that it was all in my mind, and I was simply operating on my own fear and creating the negativity that I feared.  I started to re-read some other helpful spiritual and holistic works that had helped me in the past and once again opened myself to healing - you have to also be very tired of being in pain before you can accept help and healing; then an email recently came to me that directly related to the fear-based issue I was struggling with and then I saw an interview with an author on TV and felt interested in his book - these latter two, the email and the book, referred to The Secret.  I thought - within days of each other this thing is being brought back to my attention?  I remembered, I have this book in my possession (I am now getting into the movie version of it).  I re-read it (and have now re-read it about 3 more times) and I looked back over my life and really was able to see how things I believed - both negative and positive - really have come into my life.  No more doubting here.  But you have to be ready for it.  You have to know that all the wise ones who came before us were not wrong.  You have to know that it works and see it in your own life, and you will see what all the buzz is about.  Read, watch, live it, and celebrate the results!",1194220800,3,2355,4.102620087336245

I am glad that this phenomenon got people talking because there are many people that use the secret to create the life they want.  I think the secret is based on your belief and intent.  If those are in line and you have no subconscious thoughts that contradict what you want you will see what you want begin to occur in your life.
Many people say they don't believe in the secret because of tragedies, but that doesn't mean it isn't real.  It takes mass consciousness for tragic events to occur.  I want to stay away from blame because it is not about that but responsibility.  What we see in the outside world is usually a reflection on what is going on inside.  I have had wonderful things and not so wonderful things happen in my life, but in honesty it is only in the past couple of years that I took responsibility for all those things meaning started to embrace both the good and the not so good that my life has changed.  Do I have some bad days?  Not anymore because I am not viewing it from that perspective.  I simply ask myself different questions like ""How is this a blessing?""  And usually I will find that a part of myself has grown due to whatever happened.
The secret does glam it up and I think it is to get everyone's attention.  The truth is that there are people out there right now manifesting healthy, abundant, and loving lives.  The real question is do you want to be one of those people and how badly?  How useful is it to just talk about it and not live it?
My life has completely turned around in the past couple years which has really been due to my spiritual journey.  If you have subconscious beliefs about not deserving the best or not being worthy the secret won't work.  Being a woman and minority where the world says odds are stacked against me I have been defying those odds by getting rid of those subconscious beliefs.  In all the secret is only the beginning.

Nevertheless, my positive feelings continued to build-up knowing about the Law of Attraction.  After so many years of reading books  from Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Napoleon Hill, Zig Ziglar, Carl Jung to mention a few. I was so elated to finally have a word for all the incidents in my life when  I knew that LOA was effecting my life.  This knowledge changed my life 15 years ago when I was in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. The feeling of knowing that I was not crazy to think that the future can exist NOW, makes me excited to know and attract more in my life.  Knowing that LOA has evolved into a more simply teaching  that can be shared to everyone on the planet.

The ""law of attraction"" has been out there for decades and to sell it as new age was a let down.  I found it to be a helpful reminder of practices from scriptures, minus the reliance on God.  Instead, it suggests that you need to rely of the ""universe"" to meet your desires. You might get the sense that if you don't get your wishes answered then you could feel that you did something wrong.  However, in scripture we only need to have faith of a mustard seed for our needs to be met, if they are in line with our heavenly Father's desire for our life.  We don't give children everthing they want because we know that not everything is good for them. This is something that adults should keep in mind for themselves.

My problem with this film is that it is amateurish and, from a film theory standpoint, sends very negative messages. The delivery is materialistic, base, and basically concludes that one can be happy forever, and forget all of life's problems by using the law of attraction.

I feel that it misuses and misguides viewers about the law of attraction and it's complex involvement in our perception of reality.",1192665600,,581,4.918367346938775
1609148,5,B00005JPJ8,"While I realize that the content of the Extended version of the Secret and the Original version are fairly identical, it is the way that Abraham presents certain concepts that makes this original more vibrationally enjoyable.

In one scene where the person is taking the checks out of the mail box is a case in point. The extended version has Lisa Nichols saying the word ""Debt"" over and over and over again, which of course makes you focus on your own debt and therefore makes me turn that segment off cause I don't want to hear that word again and again in my head.

That same segment in the original with Abraham, just speaks about seeing things that you don't want manifested in your life and they do not get specific about any particular thing. That is much more soothing and as Abraham would say, much more ""Down Stream"" a way to make this statement.

I love this original version.  I know that LOA works in my life. I have been manifesting things that I have put down on paper and visualized for some time now so I have many testimonies about results. I manifest money, houses, jobs and vacations that match exactly what I have written down, or match my picture that I have been focusing on.

For folks that are skeptical, all I can say is don't knock it til you try it.  For those of us that know it works....I will see you down stream.",1192665600,12,1344,4.399193548387097
1609149,1,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret is the latest and by far the worst example of a HIGHLY profitable trend where self-help gurus with fabricated new age titles and little relevant education, credentials or legitimate expertise brainwash us into believing that they know what is best for us, our marriages and our families.

Often their only contribution to society is introducing some exotic sounding, new age philosophy. However, they often cleverly form an incestuous group of like-minded ""experts"" who cross-promote each other by swearing their success is due to following the beliefs of another member of their ""cult!"" All the while, they ply the airwaves jockeying for an ever-larger audience by appearing in the national media to garner third-party endorsements.

The Self-Help Movement has become the Self-Destruct Movement by diminishing or destroying our critical thinking skills to choose and evolve on our own. We have given up the freedom to build healthy lives, marriages and families based on our unique history and life experience. Instead many victims, blinded to the value of their own life experiences, are attracted to the latest secret in self-help, in an attempt to find out what they should think, feel and how they should act... this is the definition of a cult.

The solution is a return to our (common) senses! The best way out of this learned ""self-helplessness"" is to go cold turkey. Stop following ALL self-help gurus now. Begin, instead, to reclaim your natural, God-given ability to think for yourself. The common sense that was once readily available to all of us is still there free of charge and waiting to be applied to just about any challenge we might face in life... all you have to do is use it.

Please, let's all work together to stop the flock of ""sheepeople"" who blindly move from one UNPROVEN concept to the next, looking for the answers to life's challenges that you already possess and that is the OBVIOUS!",1192492800,,1927,4.993769470404985
1609150,4,B00005JPJ8,"When I first watched this dvd, I have to say, I was very uplifted. I had been laid off from my job and was a bit sad and depressed. My friend recommended it to me and we watched it together. I think that there is some fluff - the special effects and music, etc. however, if you look at the good in the message and try not to be overly critical, you might find some things that inspire you. Try to watch it with an open mind. I think we are all too quick to judge something. I am a skeptical person and while I have not stuck with some of the lessons taught on this dvd, it does make me feel excited and happy about life. My husband already seems to use some of these principles without having watched the dvd. He has greatly benefited from them. I think the law of attraction does exist and if you take the parts of The Secret that you want to, you can benefit from it. I'm not an overly optimistic person but I felt great about the message. It's true, as most reviewers have posted, that this is a re-packaged idea that has been around for years. However, who cares - if it helps someone break out of a rut then lets be positive about it. There are certainly some things that you could get your hopes up for - especially the imagining checks in the mail. The exercise doesn't hurt as long as you know that you can't depend that this will come true for you. We cannot fill ourselves with false expectations however, like the dvd mentions, perhaps you can open a door that will give you an opportunity to make more money.

Bottom line, look through the hollywood gimics and take what you feel is special to you out of it. I also bought the book! I felt more optimistic about life after reading it. I don't live by it but it has helped me think about things in a different light, which we could all use.",1192492800,4,1801,4.160458452722063
1609151,1,B00005JPJ8,"Disclaimer: On a personal note, I believe in God.  I have no facts or evidence to back up the existence of God; it is just a feeling I have.  I could be wrong.

I am also a happy person, and one who considers himself spiritual.  I say all of this because do not want my review below to be dismissed as coming from a cold cynic.

*My review:
My main problem with this movie: it purports to be absolute fact, and fails to deliver on any hard evidence to back up its claims.  The closest this movie comes to evidence is vague personal stories, most of which are second or even third person verbal accounts of past events.

Here are five points made in `The Secret'.  Four points made in the movie are false, and the fifth is true, but vastly overstated.

*1) `In nature, like attracts like.'

Not so.  Take two magnets, each with a north and south pole.  The north pole is attracted to the south pole of the opposite magnet, and vice versa.  If you put two north poles of a pair of magnets together, they will actually repel each other.

In Nature, with most species, males are generally attracted to the opposite sex, and vice versa.  In Nature, whether it be magnets or sexual attraction, it is opposites that attract, and not `likes' as this movie claims.

*2) Vibrational frequencies are created by thoughts

Although the movie makes this claim, it never actually explains this phenomenon.  What kind of frequencies?  Are these Ultra High Frequencies (UHF) or Very High Frequencies (VHF)?  Is there electricity involved in these frequencies?  If so, is the electricity alternate current (AC) or direct current (DC)?  How do they apply to Ohm's Law?
Who conducted these studies, and how?

 If the directors of this movie are going to make a scientific claim, then I want scientific evidence backing up said claims.

*3) You can use the law of attraction to get what you want

First off, this is not a law, because it has never been scientifically proven.  The law of gravity applies on Earth regardless of where and when you test it.  I can think of many times in the lives of myself and others that we did not get what we wanted even after positively thinking about it.

On a side note: claim number 3 is perhaps the most anti-Zen thing I have ever heard.  In Zen, the key is to have no wants (because, getting what you want is simply ego gratification).  Furthermore, there is no getting what `you' want because there is no `you.'  We are all One; there is no duality.  There is no `self,' and `other.'

Yet, this movie places great value on using your thoughts to `get what you want.'  This is anti-Zen.

A Zen master would instruct his students to have no thoughts, and therefore have no wants.

I find it curious (and disturbing) that this movie, which seems to be about Enlightenment and Awakening, actually seems to be a tool to gratify the ego.

Boiled down to its essence, this movie could be called `How to Use Your Mind to Get the Things that Your Ego Wants For Its Temporary Superficial Gratification.'

From a Zen point of view, this is nonsense.  There is no mind, no ego, and no wants.  From a Zen point of view, there is no need to get what you want, because there is no `you' (and, even if there were, `you' already have everything `you' need).

*4) A positive thought has been scientifically proven to be hundreds of times more powerful then a negative thought.

Proven by whom?  How?  How was the study done?  Which scientist(s) conducted the study?  What does `more powerful' mean: that the thought has a greater electrical charge?  How has this claim been `scientifically proven?'

The movie is silent on all of these questions.

*5) The power of visualization - what you think about is what manifests itself in your life.  Positive thoughts result in a positive life.

The movie claims that this has been `The Secret' since the dawn of time, jealously guarded by its secret keepers.  And, for the first time, this movie is revealing the secret to the masses.

For the record, Norman Vincent Peale first published a book entitled ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" back in 1952!  It sold (and continues to sell) millions of copies worldwide.

The fact that visualizations can affect your life is true, but only to a point.  If you think terrible thoughts all day, it is more likely that you will make yourself miserable.  I agree with this.  I also agree with the fact that you can make yourself happier by consistently thinking positive thoughts.  Self talk is important to self esteem.

But, this movie * vastly * overstates a thought's power over your life.  It suggests that those in debt or those with other problems have said problems simply because they were thinking negative thoughts....

Does this apply to genocides as well?  Were millions of Jews, Armenians, and Rwandans et al slaughtered in the 20th century simply because they were all thinking about genocide?  Please.  Six million Jews killed during World War II because they were all thinking about genocide?  Come on.

Many, many outside factors - that have nothing to do with a person's mindset - affect their living conditions.  Paris Hilton does not drive a fancy car, and have millions of dollars because she was a `deliberate creator of her life' and visualized herself driving a fancy car and having millions of dollars.  She's rich because she was born into a family that is rich.  It was dumb luck.  This rule applies to tens of thousands of wealthy, spoiled young people around the world.

If we follow the argument of `The Secret,' it would also mean that every woman who was sexually assaulted and/or raped in the world was raped because she had thoughts that attracted the rapist into her life.  Essentially, all cases of sexual assault against women would be the woman's fault, since she was the one who came up with the thoughts that brought the rapist to her.

Sometimes an innocent child is accidentally shot to death in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting because they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Terrible things can sometimes happen to good people, and it often has nothing to do with the good person's thoughts.

.....If you want something that will help to change your life, I recommend the book 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle.  Save yourself the money and let 'The Secret' stay on the shelf.",1192406400,,6329,4.627362736273628

1609235,4,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret works using the so-called Law of Attraction.  This law says that if you think about good things, you will attract them to you. It's all about vibrations. Because all matter, animal or mineral, vibrates at a nuclear level. And apparently your thoughts, or maybe your thought waves, also vibrate.
All that lovely, touchy-feely stuff combined with the silly pseudo-science, combined with the rather creepy pledge that the supernatural does work if you want it to is going to make my life manageable now.
 I got to talking with a few people who have used the Secret's technique in the video and swear buy it. One friend said she won a trip to California in a work poll because of the Secret.  Another is saying her cancer is in remission now because of the DVD.

I was performing this when I was 6 years old.  Think happy thoughts, be around happy people, don't let bad karma suck your energy down and life spreads you out a very successful existence.

The Law of Attraction alters PROBABILITY. Some people criticizing the movie are offended by the suggested idea that children are molested by negative thoughts, the middle east is in constant strife because of negative thoughts, and people have cancer because of negative thoughts. WRONG. A child has no understanding of the law and have even less control over their thoughts so they can't very well alter the probability of being attacked, and it's not their fault. The middle east has no understanding of the law, and even if they did, the religous feud runs far too deep to be majorly affected by probability. In a somewhat more neutral situation, the Law can be used very effectively, but people must understand is that the Law grants oppurtunities more than anything else. If you are sick, and don't believe there's anything you can do about it, you will stay sick for a longer period of time. This is the only ""fault"" that can be found with cancer patients and the like. From what I've heard and seen of the Secret, it is fairly self serving. The Law can be used for much more noble purposes than self wealth, but would that sell? This is a money making product that puts the Law out there as something for selfish gain alone.

1609414,3,B00005JPJ8,"I had already been told by a friend who read the book that ""The Secret"" introduced nothing novel to anyone who has even slightly dabbled in the power of the mind/manifesting/law of attraction.  So, I went into the video with my eyes open.  And this much was true: nothing here that Norman Vincent Peale didn't write about decades ago in ""The Power of Positive Thinking"".

I disagree strongly with a portion of the video that has a speaker saying pain is brought about in life by the law of attraction.  He says ""EVERYTHING..."" This is simply not true.  Life throws you a wild card now and then.  I suffered a major tragedy - the death of a child - at a time when I couldn't believe how incredible my life was.  Plus many people I know have suffered chronic pain, serious injuries, accidents, natural disasters, etc. These things are not a result of thinking, ""Oh I hope my child doesn't die."" or ""Oh, I hope a hurricane doesn't wipe my home off the map."" I DO agree that a person who has a constant way of complaining and being disagreeable will attract things to complain about and other disagreeable people. And I do think some people go around believing they are a victim and they become victimized often. So, there's a kernel of truth there, but it's unforgivably arrogant for anyone to say that EVERYTHING - no matter how marvelous or tragic - that happens in your life has come about from you thoughts! Simply not true.

I agree, too, with another reviewer who cited the boy wishing for the bike and it just showing up by someone (Grandpa?) giving it to him. When you're ""wishing"" for something, you need to at least be aiming at a plan or thinking of what attaining it would entail. I wish I had my doctorate, but not badly enough to study for it.  So, it would be bizarre for me to wish for a doctorate unless I'm going to aim to do the work.  That is one aspect of ""The Law of Attraction"" that has been glossed over even by other authors in the past (say, Tony Robbins), but it's an important point. If you're going to set your mind on attaining something, you also need to consider the implications of what you will need to do for it to happen.  Even if you are hoping to win the lottery, you still have to act by buying the lottery ticket, unless you're hoping that you'll find one in a library book and it turns out to be a winner! In this respect, I always thought Stephen Covey was the best in ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"".  Habit One - Be Proactive.

I plan to buy this video (I rented the one I watched), not because it's earth-shattering or even totally accurate, but because it is worthwhile to remind myself to be proactive and positive about my life  It doesn't hurt to spend 1 1/2 hours now and then immersing myself in positive ideas and stories.",1190419200,6,2781,4.385214007782102
1609415,2,B00005JPJ8,"Some of the material I believe is valid and applicable to everyday life.  I am definately in the realm of belief that what you focus on you will become/recieve/etc..  The notion that things will manifest purely on thought alone though, is a bit outrageous.  I am a firm advocater in the cliche' that, ""you don't wait for your ship to come in, you have to go out and find or build your ship.""  My utter belief is that thinking positive will help attract things that you value/want in your life when you are in the act of consciously and physicaly pursuing them.  Lastly, I feel a little bit suckered for buying this.  I also bought the audio cd, and I'll be honest, everytime I hear that lady speak, my skin crawls, and I am absolutely repulsed by her words and poor examples of how to use the power of thought to creat reality(it's like listening to an out of tune drunk person sing karaoke).  It is more than obvious(in my opinion) that she is in this for the money.  I am a person of balance, and am always looking for ways and means for enhancing my life and wellbeing.  However, I think the reasoning, logic, and supporting facts to her theory is in many ways out of line, and can be used to use/exploit people(definately a cultish feel).  I will say in note of favor, that I really enjoyed the story of the man who recovered from the plane crash.  It's very humbling and inspiring.  He actively sought out to better his state.  He forced himself to try to take breaths, etc.  He sincerely believed and took steps/actions to get out of his current state, this I aknowledge and respect.",1190332800,3,1589,4.43448275862069

They want answers,  but have a hard time handling an answer that puts the responsibility of their success, health and happiness squarely in their own laps.  Are some of the ideas a repackaging of previous ideas, well yes and no.  The themes that run throughout this movie/book have been around for centuries.  I find that it has many of the same themes and practices as in Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich"".  However, this book implies more of a scientific source for thoughts to yield results, versus some sort of subconscious programming and manifestation of a burning desire.

Whatever the reason, the methods work.  Try it and see.  It may feel foolish at first, but for the results I am sure it is worth it.",1190160000,6,850,4.5394736842105265

Basically it breaks down like this ""Like attracts Like"". You attract to you what you put out type thing. This movie tries to explain how to use this on a conscious level for achieving what you want in your life instead of attracting what you don't. I love this movie, I love the idea behind this movie. I find it very empowering.

Yes, the movie does emphasize a bit on wealth and gain, however it also speaks of using it (the secret) in Health and Relationships, how it can apply to anything and anyone. I love that idea, maybe the people just need a little faith in something other than themselves. I think of this movie as a gift for the masses, just think it we could all get ourselves together long enough to do something on a deeper level. Also check out ""The Power of the Subconscious Mind by John Murphy"", it's been around since the 60's. Good luck and keep an open mind.",1189728000,2,1240,5.845303867403315
1609511,5,B00005JPJ8,"I hope this movie inspires and uplifts all who watch it.

Few would deny that if you are born into a rich family, one which values financial success, and you are taught to succeed; then you will probably be successful. Being positive will come naturally to you. If on the other hand, you are born into a poor family, one which struggles to survive, and you are taught to struggle; then you will probably not be successful. Being negative will come naturally to you.

Of course, there are exceptions. There are those who succeed despite all obstacles of birth and circumstance. We read about them.  We admire them.  And it is to those many individuals desiring to be exceptions that ""The Secret"" aims.  And there is no doubt in my mind that positive thinking is a requirement of success.

And there's nothing wrong with being successful. There was a comedian once who said, more or less, ""I've been rich, and I've been poor, and believe you me rich is better."" I think it was Joe E. Brown who said that, and I agree with him. While I have never been rich, I have been poor. And I did not like it. Making ends meet took all my time. I was too tired to meditate, too tired to read nourishing books, and too tired to spend time with those I loved. But I was not too tired to worry.

Nor is there anything wrong with being positive, setting intentions, and manifesting what you think you want. That is much better than being negative, not setting intentions, and manifesting what you think you do not want.

For those who struggle to send children to college, pay mortgages, and take care of aging parents; this will be an uplifting movie.  Life can be hard, and people need hope. But I also imagine that most of those who love the message in ""The Secret"" know that there is more to life than living the ""good"" life.  And I am sure the contributors to this DVD would agree.

As for me, the good that I seek beyond the ""good"" life is a state of inner stillness.  And, as much as I value abundance and the teachings around it, I cannot manifest this inner state through positive thinking.  It is through letting go of my thoughts that I enter into stillness.

We all know that the Buddha advocated the middle path.  He neither distained nor desired the riches of this world.  He saw that the poor struggled to get money, and the rich struggled to keep money.  Therefore he talked about living in balance, first with oneself and then with ones neighbors.  To me his words are as wise today as when he first spoke them.  And perhaps the real secret is to set our intentions to live in harmony with each other.

1609512,5,B00005JPJ8,"To appreciate The Secret, you have to have an open mind to watch it.  If you are ""the glass is half empty"" kind of person, you will only point out the flaws in this movie, because that is what you do in life.  Sure you can search for the meanings and blessings, but you don't think you can change the situation.  There IS evidence of mind-over-matter, but if you aren't open to the concept, you will think it's a hoax.  The movie doesn't say you don't have to work for something, they say you DO have to take action, you can't just visualize it.  It makes sense that if you want out of debt, you should focus on words such as financial freedom versus debt-free.  The latter still focuses on debt.  I watched the movie two weekends ago and I have been practicing positive images and the feelings associated with having financial freedom, etc. (even driving the car).  Guess what - I have used my credit card very little and paid off $7,000 of debt last week and have another $6,000 planned to pay off next week.  Oh, I also got a check in the mail today and have received 3 unexpected business referrals in the past 10 days. After struggling with my credit card debt since college (15 years),this movie has helped me change my thinking and I believe I will be out of that debt (and maybe have my car paid off)by the end of the year. Many people don't want to take responsibility for their situation, so instead blame others.  That way, you don't have to try and change it because ""it's out of your control"".
By the way, sickness CAN be healed, but like the movie says, you can't change others, only yourself.",1189641600,5,1607,4.380471380471381

1609514,1,B00005JPJ8,"It amazes me that this movie has so many fans.  I only managed to watch about 20 minutes of ""The Secret"" before a nauseated stomach forced me to turn it off.  The first 20 minutes mostly consists of various people bragging about how they made multi-million dollar houses and cars ""manifest"" in their lives.  The shallow, materialistic focus of the movie and how it exploits some small nuggets of spiritual wisdom to make money.  Aside from bragging rich people it also has many scientists and spiritual authors talking about quantum physics and how the universe is hear to serve you.  The movie even has a scene where a genie (representing the universe) appears to grant your every wish!  I have however watched a fair amount of it later as many of my friends have tried it out while I was visiting.  None of the later parts improved my impression.  To make things worse, there is not even a ""secret"" revealed in the movie.  The rich and powerful have long been bragging about how they create their reality, how the universe is hear to serve them, and how the poor and sick are only that way because of their laziness and negative thinking.  There is nothing new in this movie, creating our own reality has long been a fairly common cultural belief at least here in the US, albeit expressed in different words, such as ""creating your own luck"".

Now, I have nothing against optimism, and I do believe you can influence your reality to some extent with your thoughts. ""The Secret"" however, strongly implies that you can manifest anything you want in your life with little effort simply by thinking about it the right way.  First of all, if a nice car and house your primary life goals, you're probably going to have to work pretty hard to get them, unless you are very lucky, very talented, and/or exploit others to get what you want.  Now if you really enjoy your work, it may not even feel like work, which is fine and I believe ""The Secret"" did at least mention that some work might be required briefly in one scene.  The movie reminds me of an infomercial or one of the motivational videos you get when you join one of those network marketing companies that encourage you to sell overpriced products to your friends and family, and get them to do the same.  ""The Secret"" appeals to people's natural laziness and greed, I certainly want everything to be easy at times, and I've done (and still do) more than my fair share of whining and negative thinking, but I have come to learn there is value in good old fashioned hard work in making sacrifices to help others.  You can certainly change your perceptions, and learn to be grateful for what you have, learn to view life's unexpected unpleasantries as challenges, lessons or even opportunities,  It takes a fair amount of consistent effort and time just to change unhealthy thinking patterns, much less achieve your dreams.  Also even if you do everything right, think positive, and are very hard working, bright and talented you very well may fail, and you may suffer and die young.  You cannot control everything that happens in your life.  This is not always a bad thing as most of us don't even know what is best for us.  Besides it's possible to be happy even if you're homeless and crippled, happiness is largely a matter of perception.

Think about it, how many times have you expected(and I mean really believed) something unpleasant to happen to you, such as lose your spouse, die or lose your home only to have things turn out ok?  If what I thought about really happened to me I would be dead, homeless or vaporized in a nuclear blast long ago!  :-) Things often turn out better, or (sometimes) worse than I expect.

Not to mention all of the rape, murder, war and famine victims in the world.  Do starving children in Africa all create their own reality?  Is ""The Universal Genie"" granting their wishes, answering their thoughts?  I guess I can't know, but I highly doubt it.

""The Secret"" might be helpful if you want a little motivational push to work on your dreams, but there are much better books and movies which are a bit more realistic.  I'd recommend ""The Peaceful Warrior"" by ""Dan Millman"", ""What The Bleep"", or the ""Tao of Pooh"" by Benjamin Hoff.  They are more spiritual, encourage you to care about others rather than just getting rich, and teach you how to accept and have a sense of humor about what you can't control.  And if you think a $4 million house will make you happy then by all means go for it, but remember there is a finite amount of everything physical on this world, and everything physical you have is something others don't and may possibly even need to survive.  There is also much joy in helping others, whether it be helping the poor single mom next door by buying some groceries or cleaning her yard, giving a business loan to someone with a big dream, or donating money to feed the starving.  ""The Secret"" is narcissistic to its core.  It's modern snake oil, but I'm sure it's creators managed to manifest plenty of money.  If you want to get rich, just create a slick self-help book/movie that tells people what they want to hear!  Appeal to the ego, and you can certainly get rich, but even the makers of this piece of trash had to work a bit!

Pardon my peachiness, everything said is merely my opinion.  :-)
On the bright side it's easy to make fun of this movie, and its shear sleaziness can inspire you to question your own laziness and ego, hopefully with some benefit.",1189468800,8,5477,4.56704196519959

However, rather than addressing each individual lie, exaggeration, and irrational conclusion the movie/book makes, I'm simply going to state what it is that you believe or are planning to believe if you follow The Secret. Perhaps this short summary will distract you from your endless desire to be the center of the universe.

You believe that if you want something then by merely thinking about it, you'll receive it because you have infinite power (You = Energy = God). <-- The movie states this equivalency directly. As a consequence, anything negative that happens to an individual or a group is a direct result of their negative thoughts. Examples might include:
1. Rape victims bring rape upon themselves by being too worried about being raped.
2. Slavery is a result of individuals not thinking positively enough about their freedom.
3. Violence against gays is a result of homosexuals fearing discrimination (The movie actually uses this one!).
However, there is something that may seem unsettling to you and that is this: If I can control your actions with my thoughts, and you can control my actions with your thoughts, then who is it that's actually in control of thoughts? (Clearly not you)
Well, it's funny you should ask because that question perfectly reveals the true secret of the whole thing, and it's this...

1609578,5,B00005JPJ8,"`The Secret' is a great inspirational DVD. It is a feel good documentary about how to better oneself. It is easy to understand, and very uplifting. It should be a must see for everyone wishing to better his life. It is especially useful for those among us who are frustrated with the way things are going in their life.

This DVD, or `The Secret', is about the Law of Attraction. This law states that like attracts like, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you. In other words, think good thoughts and good things will come to you, and if you think bad thoughts then bad things will come to you.

According to the author, everything in your life is the result of the law of attraction. It is a natural law of nature. It is impersonal and it does not see good things or bad things. It is receiving your thoughts and reflecting back to you those thoughts as your life experience. In other words, the law of attraction simply gives you whatever it is you are thinking about. That is, what you think literally becomes your life.

This concept is not new. Many books in the self-help section of bookstores carry books discussing the Law of Attraction. It is found in many religions, philosophies, Western and Eastern traditions, and in New Age literature. According to the author, luminaries such as Einstein, Plato, Newton, Emerson, Lincoln, and Ford, to name just a few, knew the secret and applied it to their everyday life.

To illustrate the Law of Attraction, here are a few quotes from the `Secret':

""This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, `I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.' It is you placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.""

""When you visualize then you materialize. If you've been there in the mind, you'll go there in the body.""

""Your mission is the mission you give yourself. Your life will be what you create it as...""

Our words are so powerful, they can be used to create or destroy. Remember the saying, ""Words are mightier than the sword""? The Secret presents us with people who thought uplifting thoughts and then, at some point, became successful.

But is it really that simple? Can we truly have anything we want in life simply by thinking about it? Can a mass murderer visualize himself as the President of the US and actually become the President? Consider the following: If only 100,000 Americans visualize themselves as the next President, will they all become Presidents? What about if only 100 out of the 3 Million Americans visualize themselves as the next President? Will they all become Presidents? Assuming each President is elected for only 4 years, we can have only 25 Presidents every century (100/4=25). So how will the Law of Attraction work in this situation?

If every person on the planet visualizes himself as a billionaire, will we all become billionaires? If so, then who will work in our factories and offices? Who will pick up the trash in the morning? You get my point. We can't all be rich.

If all we get in our life is happiness (by visualizing it), how would we know what happiness is in the first place? Don't we need sadness in order to appreciate happiness?

This list could go on and on forever.

Other than its obvious weaknesses, I recommend this DVD for its uplifting message. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that `The Secret' isn't a secret anymore.",1189209600,2,3497,4.611916264090177

1609655,5,B00005JPJ8,"Wonderful movie, but misses explaining a very important part, which results in the many negative comments (and is evidence of the lack of fully understanding ""The Secret"").  Although there is a passing comment or so that addresses this issue, they are brief and surely needs further clarification.  That missing part is ACTION and the explanation that our thoughts and feelings need to result in ACTION.

In other words, when the comment was made, that the Secret is not about wishful thinking, what was really meant is that the ""thinking"" requires ""feeling"" AND ""action"".

There was mention (too brief of a mention) that we need to follow our instincts, intuitions.  When we have a inkling to do something, such as read a certain book, go down a certain street, call someone whose name just popped in our head, etc., etc.,  ... those things require action.

So although they did hint at taking action in this movie, it was not clearly discussed as one of the components of the Secret.  They say there are 3 steps, where there are actually 4.

Step 1.  Ask (you must be VERY clear, and have complete details, in what you ask.
Step 2.  Believe (unwavering faith)
Step 3. Follow your instincts and TAKE ACTION (this is the missing step in the movie)
Step 4.  Receive

I personally experience receiving what I hold in my mind.  Skeptics would consider this ""coincidence"".  If so, then why is it that I have so many more ""coincidences"" than many people and why am I experiencing more and more as I practice the Secret?

So you ask...do I have all that I want?  Not yet, but I am working on it.  Mostly, I have to identify what I want. There is so much to choose from! Remember step 1: Ask and be CLEAR in what you ask.

What many do not understand is that this is NOT an ""immediate gratification"" fantasy.  I'd like to see a sequel to The Secret that goes into further clarification of how all this works.  I agree that the movie oversimplifies the Secret.  Yet, it's amazing how many people are ready for this, and how many still are not ready.

For those who are not ready for the Secret and ask, ""If this works then why aren't you a millionaire?""  Well, ""Who says I want to be a millionaire?""  The Secret is not about becoming a millionaire.  It's about creating YOUR life the way YOU want to live it...period.  You can either apply the Secret consciously, or experience the Secret by default.  Either way, it's up to you.  Your life will reflect your choice (Oh no...It's that dreaded ""I'm responsible for my life""! I'm outta here!).

For those who are ready for the Secret, congratulations!  I know you are going to enjoy life more and more as you practice using the Secret.  It is so much fun to see the Secret work!  I keep a diary of every experience, large and small.

Here is an example of a small incident.  Whenever my daughter is with me in my car I always and I mean always, find a parking spot in the first row of where we want to go.  It started with finding a parking spot close one time.  Thereafter, I remembered that and whenever we go somewhere I imagine getting a parking spot where I want.  I would then start getting excited (thinking of how this works) and so I simply believe there will be a spot, and drive towards the front row and walla!  There is an open spot!  Works every time!

Here is another experience...I am developing training for QuickBooks and bookkeeping.  I needed a projector for my power point slide shows.  They can be expensive.  I didn't know how I could afford one at that time. but I didn't stop thinking about having one. I didn't think about all the reasons why it was impossible for me to get one right now.  I just kept picturing in my mind giving my presentation with the projector.  Lo and behold, shortly thereafter, a client of mine asked if I wanted a projector for my business since he didn't use it anymore (he retired).  It is a high end InFocus and it's perfect for my needs!  I didn't have to pay a dime for it!

Coincidence?  If you say so....but I believe that by having the thought almost every day, and picturing having a projector, the universe came up with the solution where I had none.

I've so many more experiences in my diary...some pretty significant ones.  I'll keep using the Secret and experiencing these ""coincidences"", thank you.",1188086400,10,4305,4.503234152652005

1609733,3,B00005JPJ8,"The secret is the Law of Attraction. This is a law that works regardless of whether you like it or believe it or not. If you think positive, you'll attract all the good things to your life. If you think negative, you'll automatically attract all the bad things to your life.

This DVD is like a video seminar with a group of experts talking you, first trying to convince you that the Law of Attraction is really there and then showing you how it works. They tell you ""right in the face"" that you attracted all the unpleasant things that have happened to you. As long as you see only the good things happening to you, the universe will somehow rearrange itself to give you only the good things. Don't care about how this law works. You don't need to understand electricity to be able to enjoy it. Just ask for it and receive it. Put that picture of your dream house on the wall. Write a cheque for $1M to yourself. These things will all come you somehow, some way. They will come.

If your ability to suspend disbelief is high, you'll probably be able to watch this DVD from the beginning till the end. To a critical and sceptical mind, this DVD is probably worthless. Why is 96% of all the money in the world held by 10% of the population? I don't think these folks spend too much of their time imagining how they would drive their dream cars.

In fact, the Law of Attraction is being applied by many lottery addicts in my country. Every week, they're so sure they would win. They can almost smell the money as they count it in their minds. They imagine all the things they would buy when they strike. Most of them are broke and remain broke. Let's also not forget that the rich and famous may have a few dirty secrets that have nothing to do with the Law of Attraction.

Why still 3 stars? Because I think it may work - or at least have some placebo effect on pessimists and other susceptible people. My 7-year-old nephew loves it and I believe it's doing him a lot of good.

For the rest of us who are already functioning close to our full potential, we already know how to dream and look ahead. Of course, we also watch our backs when we stay ahead. And if that dream car doesn't come free, you'd better make sure you can service the loan. No amount of wishing or positive thinking will stop the repo guys from towing it away.

The power of positive thinking is real and put into the context of religion and God, it can have amazing power.  I consider a lot of this principle to be the power of prayer as Jesus even taught, ""Ask and it is given"".  That said, Christians need to put on a filter when viewing this or reading the book as most of the philosophers take God out of the equation and out of the very details of our lives.  Contrary to what this movie says, I believe children that have been abused or victimized did NOT invite or attract that into their lives (I'm an adult that had a great childhood but feel sad for those that didn't).  We can control how we react and act in OUR lives.  Another persons choice however is that persons choice.

1609790,1,B00005JPJ8,"[...]First off, the beginning of the movie starts by saying that the ""law of attraction"" attracts to you everything you fear. For example, if you fear getting more bills in the mail, then more bills will appear. If you fear your bike getting stolen, then your bike will get stolen. And the list goes on and on. To me, this is a total insult to anyone that has ever been a victim of a crime. A woman that is raped by the guy living in the apartment next door more than likely never thought of it. And who knows, she may even be the victim of someone she doesn't even know. The truth is, things happen because they happen! I used to ride my bicycle to the shopping mall back in the 80s when I was very young and finally into my early teens. Anyway, I never used a bike lock, and I worried incessantly that someone would steal my bike. I know that at least 20 times, I frantically worried and my heart was beating like crazy with fear when I ran out to look at the bike rack. And lo and behold, there it was, my bike!!!! My worrying was a total waste of time. It never happened! And if I was smart, I would have just locked the darn thing up, thereby keeping myself from having to worry.

A couple of years ago, my mom's house was robbed. And being that she lived in a nice neighborhood, that was the last thing on her and my mind that this would ever happen. So this whole idea of creating your misery by fearing it and dwelling on it is totally out of line. Totally!!!! Again, most rape and robbery victims don't even fear being victimized if they should be so unfortunate.

Another ridiculous thing in the film was the gay man that was having trouble with his job. According to one of the speakers on the video (about 20 of them) he said that Bob (the gay man) was writing to his Internet help site and complaining about how he feared being gay-bashed, and how people were always persecuting him for all this. Well, once Bob started to think positive, by some magic, the people at work that persecuted him all seemed to stop. They were either fired, left the company, or just stopped picking on him. The gay bashers on the way home from work just magically disappeared, as if they were beamed aboard the Starship Enterprise. Holy cow captain! It's a miracle. Jesus Christ's curing of the leper has some competition!

In real life, gay bashers are going to exist, even in the presence of gays with high self-esteem. The gays with high self-esteem just deal with it better, and usually don't live in areas where losers like this hang out. Most gay bashers are usually people that can't come to terms with their own issues, so they need to take it out on someone that can't defend themselves. But nevertheless, they don't just go away because some gay person decides not to fear them.  And they don't just appear because some gay person fears them either!

Another issue that was absurd was the good-looking girl that is circling personal ads in the paper in search of the perfect man! As if good-looking women need to do this! Please, Miss Producer, don't insult my intelligence. And the woman is magically invited to a volleyball game where three people (one a handsome single guy) is just waiting there to satisfy her loneliness and despair. A more realistic scenario would have been if the woman was not so attractive, and she ran into another guy that was equally not attractive. Even though they weren't the greatest looking, they still found the goodness in one another, and decided that they were right for each other. That would have made more sense. But again, good looking men and women (especially women) don't have trouble finding good-looking mates. They are asked out all the time. And they surely have no need to seek the newspaper personals.

I don't want to belly ache all day on this movie, but I will say that it is a disservice for someone trying to get into the self-help movement. My recommendation: Purchase Brian Tracy's ""The Psychology of Achievement"". That course is very detailed in telling you the type of person you are, and who you've become. It lays out a way to set you success mechanism in motion by setting concrete goals and eliminating destructive behavior. Also, Zig Ziglar's ""Goals"" and ""See You At The Top"" are great books and audio series as well. All these courses may cost you a hundred bucks of less, but they are well worth the money. They put this film ""The Secret"" to shame.

Lastly, ""The Secret"" gives you no game plan. Telling you to think positive is not a game plan, it's just the kind of garbage you would learn at an Amway convention or a Wal-Mart pep rally. You need concrete advice, which is what Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar do for you.

I have known for at least 50 years that church leaders were shortchanging Jesus' comments about the power of the spirit and mind, but no matter what I  read, it would only stay with me for a short time.  It takes me 90 minutes to get to work and back and I listened to the download every day for almost two months, until I had memorized every concept and knew how to live in a positive way.  It's a simple concept, but it was tough for me to stop negative thinking and move on to positive ""vibrations.""  The change has been PHENOMENAL.  I see the results of it every day and people around me see them, too.  There is so much more abundance of everything in our lives (my wife is studying it, too).  Now, because I have heard it too many times, I have purchased Michael Losier's MP3 download.  It does a better job of providing a method, but it's not as fun to listen to.

Do I  believe everything Rhonda says?  No, I  don't.  No one will ever convince me the collective passengers on the Titanic wanted it to sink, that Jews were just waiting for Hitler to carry out their negative thoughts, or that those who died on 9/11 were hoping for an airplane crash.  That's nonsense.  On a lighter note, her comments about losing weight or getting your wish by ""pretending"" is silly.  Michael Losier deals with this better.

Does ""the law of attraction"" work?  Of course it does!  Does it work every time?  No.  But Jesus says it works a lot more than we think it does. It's still the truth:  Ask, believe, receive.

The Law of Attraction is not new, but it works marvelously for those who use it, no matter what name they call it by.  All major sports teams, as well as individual athletes, have been using this concept, in the form of self hynosis, for many years.  Let's face it, people who achieve success in any endeavor do so largely because of their attitude -- ones attitude is what draws success (or failure) to themselves.  Attitude isn't everything -- it's the only thing!  And this is what ""The Secret"" is all about -- attitudde.  Call it attitude, or the Law of Attraction, or whatever you want, but those who learn and understand how to change their minds WILL change their lives.

1609835,5,B00005JPJ8,"I think some people are getting the wrong idea. If you assume that by just wishing for something with no action behind it is the secret, you are absolutely right. It's the secret to absolute failure. However, I do not believe that this was the message here. I compare the universe to the basic operation of a computer. When we boot up, our C drive spins with all the information it has available to us. Picture this as the universe. Then we download a specific program {Word or Photo Shop etc.) to facilitate whatever we need to do. All the data in the C drive is spinning and accessible to us, but the specific program selects and only picks what it wants and places it on the screen.  Picture this as our intentions, our wishes, or our mental visualizations selecting and picking out from the universe the manifestations we desire in our lives.  However, and this is the key, like the program on our computer screen, it will not write that Pulitzer Prize winning novel or edit that award winning photograph for you. Nevertheless, it will give you all the tools and options like the universe. Once it has our intentions it will give us the ideas, opportunities and the means to attain whatever it is we wish to actualize. But we are the ones that have to bring our ideas to light, seize the opportunities that are presented to us and utilize the means that the universe provides us to employ. This is the secret!

Is it new? Absolutely not. Deepak Chopra said it a thousand times already in his ""Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,"" and his many other books and audios. Viktor Frankl (Author/Psychiatrist) said that the only reason he survive the Nazi death camps was his belief and conviction that he would live to tell the tale. Rumi and Gandhi professed it and please lets not forget Jesus, ""Ask and it will be given you"" and ""What you truly believe will come to pass.""

The car and bicycle scene was a little over the top. However, was it presented in a new and impressive way? Did it keep my attention? Did it add a new twist, touch or nuance to this old secret? Yes! Yes! And Yes! Personally, I can't get enough of this stuff!

Want to know the real secret? everyone who buys or rents the movie, reads the book or listens to the audiofile are doing exactly what they're getting mad about!

I can see it now... Byrne is sitting by her mailbox, imaginging checks in the mail from people who buy into her garbage... and it works! Beacuse people just want to see ""what all the buzz is about."" Guess what? She gets a cut of everything, so you're making the philosophy true - for HER.

1609839,5,B00005JPJ8,"Inside 'the secret' there was a quote, something like it doesn't matter which path you take, you have made both the right and the wrong choice, so i guess it really depends on how you look at it.
The secret is no secret, everyone knows that being optimistic and thinking positive is likely to be more beneficial than whining and blaming everyone else for their problems.
After watching the film, i felt happy, inspired and i really felt moved, and the laws of physics being what they are, i decided to investigate the equal and opposite reaction, being peoples reviews.
Call me stupid, but i honestly believed that the film was not intended as magic, but more based on positive thought.
If i want to do well at my studies, i should stop giving myself excuses, change my attitude and the rest will flow, and i believe this.
A lot of the information is ambiguous, and can be related often to our daily lives, for example i know a person who blames their lack of success on everyone else, and is constantly in a negative state of thought. I believe if he chose to 'move on' think positive and envision himself in a positive manner, he would then eventually become, this has to be true.
As other have suggested, not all people deserve the things that happen to them, and no amount of positive thinking will change their lives, because they live in a world we could probably never understand.",1185753600,10,1387,4.552

The other secret to The Secret is share the wealth.  Share the wealth of information that The Secret presents.  It has been hidden from the public too long.  The final secret to The Secret is LIVE IT!!  Dare to live this way.  Dare to let go of the things that have kept you stuck.  Dare to imagine a new life, a new future, a new NOW.

1609908,2,B00005JPJ8,"As other reviewers have stated this movie has all the feel of an informercial.. This is pop psychology that is designed to provoke attention from people who dream of stepping into business and making millions of dollars simply by their positive attitude.. While i do agree that being positive can help you - of course it can its common sense - people do not see the full picture when deliberately taking this attitude.. If you try to be postive that is what you will become - someone who is trying to be positive - you will not be the genuine article.. That is why i believe in nothing.. That is i don't commit myself to one particular way of thinking.. I am not saying that this is the best way it is simply my way... and i think it would help people a great deal if they stopped trying to be things and just simply be yourself..
Now for another quibble i have with these pop psychological viewpoints.. They are creating a group of people who avoid negativity like the plague.. what is wrong with being negative? Being negative can be very useful - i am sure many problems in the world have been solved simply because some negative guy pointed out the weaknesses in a particular approach.. The truth is positivity and negativity are both of the same value..
Now i don't mean to be discouraging a change in perception would actually do good for a lot of people and that is all this so-called secret is a change in perception.. If you pay attention to the very ordinary things going on around you - you will actually start to value things differently this is true.. you will be satisfied with less and you might even find your niche..

I've watched it twice and I'm planning to watch it more times. I've listened to the audio CD's probably over 20 times as well. Overall I think this movie is a way better version than the book (that with all the icons and drawings can be quite distracting).I give it two thumbs up.

We are powerful beyond measure and our faith in our power to create intentionally is key.  If this movie brings up questions or defenses, I invite you to discuss them and to be open to an answer, even if it differs from what you have come up with so far.
One of the things this movie brought up for me was ""Did the families of the victims of 9-11 really all create loss in their life in the same way at the same moment?""  The answer that came to me is ""No"".  I create my life.  That is true.  But I am also aware that there are things more powerful at work, such as the collective creation of millions of people.  9-11 was not the creation of those who died or their families, but a cultural, collective, world creation.  I have more to say about that, but it would be off topic for a movie review.

As for my own life, I have been using the secret every day.  I create being on time, seeing a particular flower, powerfully impacting to group I speak to that night.  And as the days go on and I see more things that I create become realized, my faith in my ability increases and I am able to create bigger and more impactful things in my life.....like a trip to Thailand!!!  I chose to go to Thailand in January.  I felt what that would be like and imagined myself there with a good friend of mine.  I pictured where we will go and what we will do and feel how proud and happy I am.  Every time the thought, ""How am I going to afford this?"" entered my mind, I replaced it with, ""I don't know how, but it will happen"" and I began feeling what it will be like to be there.  Then, my friend told me she really wanted me to go to Thailand with her in January and she would pay for half of my ticket if I would go!  Later that day, I got an inspiration out of nowhere!  I realized that January is right after the holidays and for a split second felt defeat.  Then, it came to me...I will create my gifts...not only that, but I will get together with friends who are inspired to create gifts and save money over the holidays once a month until Christmas and we will create gifts together.  These get togethers will inspire more creation!  And we will be putting time, energy, thought, and love into our gifts (so much more valuable than money!).  On top of that we will be spending positive time together having fun, connecting, and inspiring each other.

I literally have watched this dvd every day, perhaps missing only one or two here and there, for almost a month.  I still see something more clearer every time I watch. I was reading Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich"" at the same time as the dvd was on, and I was amazed at how similar what I was reading was being portrayed on the dvd.  Phenomenal stuff!  I see examples of how this works constantly, and am actively trying to focus more on the areas that I have chosen as my key goals.  The Secret sounds simple - - like attracts like - -  but it is not as easy as one might think.  But after watching this dvd as much as I have, I feel the dvd offers the greatest first step into your new life that you can do.  It says it all, talks about abundance, love and romance, health, world events, and all of us in the big scheme of things.

The concept is simple: focus on something until you get it.  You'll be so focussed that it won't matter that you've lost your job for poor performance, because you'll be too busy daydreaming about what you really want.

This is the perfect video and book for those of you who are desperate to get something for nothing, because you think it is too hard to pull yourself up to a point where you can afford to buy things for yourself.  You will take small coincidences and build a specious case that ""this works,"" and you will recommend it to your friends.  In the end you will perpetuate a myth that you are ready to believe and accept, putting your faith in random events, all to reinforce your core belief that your life will be better if you have more.

1609977,5,B00005JPJ8,"The beginning of the video could easily be explained. There are those who would rather the average Joe not take responsibility for their lives but to live desperately and look for the government, charities, or strangers to bring order into their existence, trading off their own power to create, thusly making themselves slaves to others.

It's been said by more than one poster that the information found within the video could be easily found, this is true. However if this information was really ""commonsense"" as stated before how could one explain so many people living in lack, poverty, disease, despair, and hardships of every kind?

If you are the average person and you're weighed down with false societal programming, faulty (bias & false) religious dogma you wouldn't exactly know what to look for much less what it was called you were seeking.

So yes I can see why the video was named The Secret. If a person was curious about how much of this ""commonsense"" information has been applied in their lives to their advantage all they have to do is be honest. Are you living your life fully and joyfully? Are manifestations in your life those that you want? If the answers are NO, then it's time you rediscovered your DIVINITY.

Don't let the simplicity of the video fool you, it has been a light for many people in regaining their freedom to create on purpose the lives they wanted.",1184112000,3,1390,4.755186721991701
1610048,1,B00005JPJ8,"There is nothing secret here. It's part common sense, part psuedo-science, part historical-fiction, part Eastern religious. Some of the assertions in the Secret are actually quite funny! How do people actually believe this crap? It's basically two or three concepts.

One concept is that our thoughts become reality.... Well yes, to an extent. Human beings, through the fact that our brains have the capacity to set goals and be creative and imaginative, have reshaped society and our planet. That is true. What is not true is that we have some kind of psychic powers which is what the Secret proclaims. A man visualizes an elephant and concentrates really hard, and an elephant appears in his living room. Hilarious!!! I picturing the after effects (i.e. man running for his life and the elephant leaving feeses all around his living room). Besides that it is just plain nonsense. Also throughout the Secret, people are constantly shown projecting these ""thought waves"" as if their brains are directly physically effecting their environment!

Concept two: If you think positively, positive things will happen. If you think negatively, negative things will happen. This is true to an extent as well. This has really more to do with a person's interpretation of events. If a person views their daily life in a positive sense, even the most negative things will not seem so severe. If a person views their daily life in a negative sense, they are often viewing the glass half empty and are not appreciating the positive things going on around them. However, this has nothing to do with some Secret psychic powers that human beings possess.

Another ridiculous claim the Secret makes is that former historical figures (like United States Presidents) knew about the Secret which is why they were so successful. Did you know the upper classes of society have known the Secret for hundreds of years? Of course they knew that the human mind has psychic powers! And the Secret asserts that they hid this knowledge from the lower classes to oppress them! (early 20th century footage is shown of a factory manager in a suit surrounded by his busy, overworked factory workers).

This is basicly common sense and basic concepts buried within a bunch of science/historical fiction with a little religious undertones. If you believe this crap is true than you might as well believe Barney the dinosaur is real too.",1184112000,4,2400,4.9925

This video is worth watching to learn what the law of attraction is, to see how it is embedded in history, and to give yourself that nudge to start practicing the law. However, don't expect some magic way of making things happen.  The Law of Attraction is not about making a wish and getting what you want.  You do have to do some work, open yourself up to opportunities, be willing to take some risks, step out of your comfort zone, and believe that you are worthy of more in your life. I personally feel that the belief part is the most important.

Rhonda Byrne did a nice job in putting this film together, but it is obvious, especially for someone with vast knowledge on this sacred law, that she really isn't aware of the universe around her and did not do a thorough job of researching the foundation of the law and applying it as actionable items to real life.

As one might infer from my solitary apportioned star, I was greatly displeased, not only by the ideas being advocated, but by those who were advocating them. What chagrined me most was the smug satisfaction of these select people - each of them entirely convinced that they have unlocked the recondite key to the universe when really they're just reiterating the most basic maxims about positive thinking, but with a zealous, cocksure slant, as though such an affectation might make what they're proposing seem more palatable or plausible. They affirm that anything is possible simply by filtering out the negative thoughts - hell,  just loll on your chair, imagine driving that car, and, soon, magically, it will be yours - no labour required. Maybe I'm oversimplifying a trifle, but no wonder.

I must ask, why are each of the proponents eminently detestable? Has an overexertion of delusional positiveness rendered them so? I think it's very likely.

One thing that especially vexed me was this: the woman at the start asserts that most of the great genuises were advocators of this secret ""Law of Attraction"" - yet, well, they weren't. It's rather a foul ruse. Perhaps if these people were less smug, maybe if they conceded that their ideas were disputable, then I would be slightly less appalled.

Oh, and the acting was execrable, too.",1183075200,8,1608,4.940740740740741
1610198,2,B00005JPJ8,"My husband and I watched this DVD (thank God we didn't purchase it) last night.  Throughout the entire film, we kept waiting for a magic word that never came:

WORK.

Here's an example in the film:

A boy wants a bicycle.  He cuts out a picture of it, strokes it, gazes at it adoringly and smiles.  That's all.  He doesn't get a paper route or do extra chores to earn money; he just sits around and wishes.  He opens the door one morning and Voila! There is the bicycle, flanked by the smiling grandfather who had purchased it for him.  Now, I'm thinking that this grandfather sees the kid mooning about for a bike (probably to the extent that he NEGLECTS his chores, as it never shows him doing anything to earn the bike) and he indulges the kid with the bike of his dreams.  Cool, man. So the lesson here is...sit around on your duff and wish for something you could probably earn yourself until someone else does it for you?  Well, looking at our country's vast entitlement system, I guess it works.

The book also seems to contradict itself.  It says one can't control others, one can only control oneself.  However, if we are putting forth those mellow yellow vibes into the universe to snag ourselves a BMW, someone else is going to have to come through for us, since we're obviously too busy downloading our order from the Great Cosmic Catalogue  (""the universe is a catalogue"" was actually mentioned in the film) to actually...I don't know...WORK for it. Someone has to foot the bill. Who will that be?  Taxpayers and those family members everyone else sponges off of.  Yep, place your order with the Cosmos.  We're happy to serve you.

In the film, there was this hapless loser who keeps going to his mailbox and finding bills upon bills upon bills and he has the nerve to look surprised.  He's now in major debt, sinking like the Titanic.  The narrator solemnly intones that this individual is ""attracting"" bills and debt to him (yeah, credit cards will do that) and that all this poor schmuck needs to do is to visualize checks coming into his mailbox.  The Schmuck does and the checks miraculously appear in his mailbox (it never mentions that he worked for them). Visualizing wealth and prosperity is fine, but I highly recommend that one cuts up his credit card to make it happen.

The book says that ANYTHING you want you can have just by the ""Ask-Believe-Receive"" formula. However, if one believes in God, they know He isn't always as accommodating as we would like, for our own good. If we want something that is going to be detrimental to our spiritual health, God will refuse us. Let's face it, even the most intellectual of us are too stupid to always know what is good for us.

There is some good advice in this book.  To be thankful for what one has and in doing so, one will bring in more positivity to their lives. I believe that. To visualize and dream and feel like you already have that object of desire. I believe that, also.  That ""like attracts like.""  Amen to that.

But let's not leave ""work"" out of the equation. Otherwise, ""The Secret"" should be renamed ""The Moocher.""",1182988800,12,3102,4.54054054054054

1610253,1,B00005JPJ8,"The main thesis of the film is that the ""secret"" to anything in life, wealth, health, success, love, romance, happiness is positive thinking, thinking positive thoughts. More specifically, imagining things that you want to have and really, truly believe that you already have them, and feel good about having them now!

For example, if you want to be rich, you should first imagine that you are already rich; second, you should really believe that you are already rich; and third you should feel yourself in a rich life style, feel happy about it. If you keep doing this for awhile, miraculously the doors of wealth will open to you, all the opportunities will line up at your door and you will be well into your way to becoming that rich person you are imagining. Similarly, if you want to loose weight, you should imagine yourself in your ideal weight, really focus on that, only allow yourself ""thin thoughts"" and avoid ""fat thoughts"", and you will get thin.

All you have to do is just ask (oh, and believe, and feel) for the thing you want and lo and behold, thou shalt have it! I quote: ""Make a command to the Universe. Let the Universe know what you want. The universe responds to your thoughts."" Another one: ""The Universe will start to rearrange itself to make it happen for you.""

1610254,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've recently read a lot of criticism concerning this DVD and book. I have both.  They are not the first things I have read concerning the particular philosophy espoused in this book, and they probably won't be the last.

This information is not new.  It is also not just about materialism.  And for all the people who criticize it by saying that it puts the blame (and also success) squarely on the victim/victor, let me ask you this:  is it really so much better to believe that a magical floating head in the sky caused your rape/murder/terminal illness?  We all know bad things happen to good people, and vice versa.  If you didn't attract your experiences to you, then you are being punished when something bad happens to you.  Punished for what?  Sin?  Please.  What sin have newborn babies committed that so affronts your magical floating head that he kills them in house fires, with SIDS, gives them autism, etc.?

It is actually empowering once you understand how and why this works.  You can change how you feel about things, but you can't change how someone else feels about you, and that includes that elusive magical floating head in the sky.  If you pay attention to the people around you, you will see that life is almost charmed for people who are the most genuinely happy.  They aren't happy because life is easier.  Happiness brings ease.  It's not the other way around.

Let's talk about a famous actor, one of the highest paid if not the highest paid in Hollywood.  I'll leave his name out of this, but here's what he did before he was famous: He sat up on the hill behind the Hollywood sign and visualized money streaming toward him and success in movies; and he visualized and fantasized about the life this would allow him to lead.  He did this nearly every day for quite some time.

No, this stuff doesn't work.  Go back to your belief in lack and give your money to a shrink (the loudest critics) who'll listen to you complain about your life and not encourage you to better yourself unless you are having problems paying his/her bills.",1182816000,3,2061,4.589041095890411
1610255,5,B00005JPJ8,"I watched this for the first time when it was available as a computer download and have just gotten the DVD copy.  Its real power is to align your thoughts in accordance with your desires, to help you to focus on what you want rather than what you don't want, and then to have you take action consistent with those desires.

To those critical of the methodology because you are skeptical that your thoughts can create your reality, I say you can have anything you want for yourself and your life, but you can't have it merely by wanting it: that is thinking appropriate for a five year old.  I don't believe that was the mentality they were espousing, nor do I believe they expect us to believe that.  Instead, you create that desire for yourself, you eliminate any negative feelings that would detract you from having that, and then two things will happen.  1)Taking action to realize that desire will become automatic and natural to you, and 2)you will begin to notice new opportunities to realize that desire that would have gone unnoticed.

Is it a secret in that this knowledge was deliberately kept hidden from the public?  Perhaps.  In our liberated society of the 21st Century when so much knowledge is readily available, we can't imagine what it was like to live under the rule of the 12th century church, where popes and kings controlled what people knew and didn't know.  And yes, even today, there may be things that we don't even know that we don't know which our government or other leaders are keeping from us.  But just as likely is that it is a secret in the terms of something previously unknown to us that is a key piece of knowledge, even if it wasn't deliberately kept from us.

If you are critical of the video because you feel it focuses too much on material wealth, remember that there were two separate segments dealing with romantic relationships and physical health as well.  Remember the artist who painted women turning away from him until he was told to paint himself surrounded by women, then to paint himself in a committed relationship with one woman?  Remember the piece where Bob Proctor said, ""Let the doctors focus on the disease?""(Notice he didn't advocate an abandonment of modern medicine, just a choice to consciously draw health to you while you let the doctors take care of the negative side)  The acquisition of material wealth using these tools is a teaching exercise, and once you have those things and learn to use these tools, you have those tools that you can use for greater things.

The Secret is not a complete treatise on the Law of Attraction.  It is more of an introductory course.  And once you have the introductory course, you can move on to more advanced training in using the Law of Attraction.  And remember-you don't have to understand how it works any more than you have to understand how electricity works.  Just use it and enjoy its benefits.",1182816000,4,2907,4.653620352250489
1610315,5,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is an exciting revelatory journey into a world of increased success and happiness. By focusing on your desired destiny you materialize your positive thoughts. While the secret is immediately revealed it is the way in which it is applied that presents most of the intrigue. How can you instantly start to change your life? How do you manifest wealth or even good health? Can your emotional state affect your life in dramatic ways, even healing the body from within?

Authors, doctors, philosophers and visionaries share their thoughts on how you can increase abundance in your life. They present ways in which you can invite more happiness, health and wealth into your life. Famous quotes are interspersed with a very personal message of hope. Relationships are also discussed and ideas are given for how you can attract love into your life or solve problems in a troubled situation.

The entire program presents a logical explanation of a deeply held belief. This belief transcends all religions and cultures and goes right to the heart of what it takes to be more successful in every area of your life. A three step process helps to awaken your own inner power and then information is given on how to visualize your wishes so they start to materialize in your life within months, weeks or even days.

This program does not promise to answer all the questions about problems in the world, but it does present a way for you to experience a personal transformation. If you believe in God then I think this will be even more meaningful because there is also a spiritual dimension. Also, none of the authors really mention that it takes a lot of work to write a book or that you have to be extremely dedicated and even work pretty hard to achieve your dreams. While they focus on the ideas, you will find the manifesting to be a unique process that may involve various levels of persistence and patience. The beauty of this DVD is that the message is positive and it is a refreshing change from negative thinking.

""The Secret"" rings true because you have more than likely experienced this in your life already and just didn't know it was one of life's greatest secrets. We already know positive thinking brings success, but this is the next level. Through analyzing ""The Secret"" and then applying it to your life you can transform your current reality and manifest your dreams.

1610316,2,B00005JPJ8,"One of the main ideas in the DVD was ""the laws of attractoin"" they say that if you think money you will get money. Like attracts Like. But a simple primaryt school experament can show with the use of a magnet that opposites attract. I do not think that if you simply think posotive about something that you are just going to get it. I think that you should work hard and be re-warded for it.

I do not agree with another comment that was made about GOD not being in the movie. I think that the movie was aimed for everyone and not just a specific religion. When you think about it god plays a role in spirtuality and not a massive role in mentality. A crazed killer can say that god is one with them but that their spirituality speaking not the mentality of the person.

In it many successful people identify steps to help you transform your life into one that is successful, happy and vibrant. As I watched it I felt myself disagreeing with the way it was presented, not the ideas themselves. Firstly, it was hokey, the way the video begins. It does sound like an infomercial, where you try to bring in the suckers who want to get rich quick. It is more than that; it does outline steps to take to use the energy of the Universe to manifest what you want. But in order to make it marketable to the masses, there is this element of ""try this and your life will change"".
Secondly, that it bravely presents this kind of information is itself a sign that ""the times they are a-changin."" The controversy generated is proof that many of us are ready for this information--and many aren't. One has to keep an open mind. Some will-and have-rejected this DVD because of the way it is presented, and I have to say, it really did get on my nerves as well. But there are gems here, and what gets buried under all the hype is the fact that you have to attune to the energy of your desires and, more than wish for it, you have to intend for it to happen and work towards it with discipline and positive visualization. These ideas are not new, but they are put out there in an organized way, and attempt to make conscious what successful people do intuitively.
How you approach this phenomenon will affect your reaction, and there are many ways to look at it. You can say that the Universal energy is available to assist you if you raise your energy vibration to match it. You can say that you can change your entire perception in the blink of an eye with a thought (if is accompanied by a flash of true insight). Carolyn Myss would say that we are just trying to manifest more ""stuff"" in our lives; that we really do co-create our lives at every moment, but more important than how we get what we want is to know what we really want and WHY we want it.

I've watched it several times and I feel duped by Rhonda Byrne because all she has managed to do is give all the people who participated in the film, a forum in which to get rich.  It's a get-rich scheme for them, not us, the viewers!  And, I wonder why Ester Hicks isn't in the extended version???",1181865600,2,396,4.184210526315789

I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't a religious infomercial, but it was definitely a get-rich-quick infomercial.  I think that to some extent we do have the power to attract ideas and things with our thoughts...in the English language this is known as COINCIDENCE.  On the whole this is a very well-made film, and definitely better put together than ""What the Bleep"" but they even use some of the same people so it gets a little repetitive.  Bottom line, too much hype, and guess what, the people in the film that make a $%^&load more money than you do WORKED HARD to get where they are, and they are making even more money by getting on this DVD and telling you that they simply gained success by having positive thoughts.  It would be naive to believe everything in this film but I would say that it is a nice thought, so to speak. There's certainly nothing wrong with positive thoughts, but I'm not going to win Powerball this week if I sit and meditate with a lotto ticket taped to the wall.",1181865600,3,1162,4.462264150943396

1610387,5,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is a powerful tool that I have started to utilize in my life and I find it to be a very valuable resource in the improvement on my mental and my physical state of being.

I understand that this concept of the Law of Attraction has come under much criticism because it seems to be a bunch of mistruths aimed to mislead to viewer/reader into a false sense of security or prosperity. While I believe the Law of Attraction to be a real occurrence and I practice it in my day to day life, and see the effects it has to me in relationships, luck, wealth, and just an overall improve state of being, too many focus on the material outcomes on the law and don't focus on the roll the law can play in your life. Regardless of the validity of the secret and how much it actually works this movie has found a way to help people meditate and visualize and actualize their goals. In my opinion, to have a complete transformation of how I look at the world, and turn my mentality to a more ""glass is half full"" approach, I am a much happier person and I thank this movie and book for giving me the inspiration and confidence to be optimistic. I have gratitude for everything that is around me; I appreciate the things and people in my life, and have a positive view of my life and my future. Now whether the Law of Attraction exists or not, which I believe it does because I see it everyday, don't criticize a tool that more than anything makes you a happier, and a more grateful person.

I urge you to give this a chance and experiment; the actually process costs nothing of you, and only demands you to have a positive outlook on your life. Give it a chance to work, don't get frustrated, have faith, and look at your surroundings with a new sense of joy, and I promise you will see a change for the better, whether you get that new car or not, you will smile more, and it will improve you life in unexpected ways. The mentality of people today, is based around too much pessimism, and they don't have faith in anything anymore, always looking on things with skepticism, but for once, have faith, and think positively, it will work wonders, give it a chance, and stop passing this off as a hoax, because honestly the results on the Law of Attraction are not measurable like the Law of Gravity, and if it doesn't instantly produce results we pass it off as crap.",1181779200,3,2362,4.30561797752809

You should buy both because you will watch them so often you might as well own them.

This DVD tries to present to us Law of Attraction in a very very simple manner. Of course its is not all about money, jewelry, cars or trying to indulge yourself in a materialistic world. Money and wealth is definitely a part of prosperity, but it is not all. I want to reply to some people who have negative thoughts. Its not how wealthy and rich you get, its what you do with that wealth, to help others bring them up to the level where they can have their own dreams. Its about being grateful and giving back to society. This DVD is just a very good start and it really serves its purpose well; ""to introduce the masses to the secret"". Its up to each individual to see want they want to do with their lives. If you don't believe this and think this is a bunch of money making scheme, then that is your reasoning and no one will argue. To me, this reasonates with my ""soul"" and it is up to me to make my own dreams, not others. Hope you give yourself a chance and don't stop others who want to.",1181520000,10,1095,4.097674418604651

1610392,1,B00005JPJ8,"Ok, let's stop to think about the film What the Bleep, shall we?

What the Bleep brought a new kind of documentaries, it was the pioneer from documentaries that tell us how to deal with our lifes in a kind of psychological and biological way. Ok, it was a sucess and to tell you the truth I liked it very much too.

So, why The Secret? The Secret has nothing new. You've already heard their ""Law of Attraction"" before, but told in a different manner. There is nothing scientific about it, nothing from psychology or biology, it's a mix of ""money maker"" writers and one or two scientists that appear for less than a minute.

The entire film they keep repeating the same thing over and over again... It seems that those men and women know nothing about Math, probability or even have read any book from Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins or Stephen Jay Gould (well, they should, since those writers say that they are money maker liers with no scientific base).

Do you wanna a reference? Remember the Patrick Swayze charatcer on Donnie Darko movie? Or the religious character played by Steve Martin? Well, it's the exactly same thing. If you consider yourself a smart person, save your money, make a favor to yourself and spend your money in What the Bleep, a psychology documentary or another kind of movie.

The materialistic nature of this production misses the essence of positive thinking.  I can assure you all that owning cars, jewellery, etc has very little to do with happiness (most of you know this), and yet this production seems infatuated with money equalling success - it doesn't.  Learned Optimisim by Seligman is a far more practicable book.  Understanding what achievement really is by reading seminal papers from McClelland will help. Identifying how you are currently performing by getting feedback from others you trust through a highly validated tool like those from Human Synergistics International will give you a real view of where you are - and therefore what you need to do to get what YOU want from life.

The Law of Attraction is not merely a new marketing tool to sell a few million books, it is the key to how this universe works. Those who see this as a book about how to get rich quick or lose weight without dieting are missing the point of what is being taught. People can only ""hear"" what they are ready to accept, the success of Rhonda's book happily implies that millions of people are now ready to listen.

Those who don't ""get"" the message are simply not ready for it and so it falls on deaf ears. This is not just another ""power of positive thinking"" book. ""The Secret"" offers insight into how to focus your thoughts in a way which will allow the cells of your body to align with the reality you truly want to create. If you are looking for a way to change your way of thinking, to attract what you want into your life, this book/DVD offers an introduction into the laws which make it all happen.

Aside from that, I'd advise this to anyone who thinks he/she has tried everything to find happiness and feels like giving up in believing that one can be happy in this world.

Do we really need this moronic DVD and theory of attraction so we can lure the next expensive gold chain or BMW into our lives? Are these authors serious? Can't we all just remember that if we strive for meaningful goals through hard work, patience, and persistence we will get what we want most of the time?

About less than half the students paid any attention, but if only one was able to make the most of his/her life as a result, I am happy.

I didn't get the DVD, I saw this on Channel 7 in Australia, months before it was shown on Oprah, the producer of this is from Australia after all. I was getting quite bored of it after awhile, but then they featured Bill Harris, who makes the Holosync CD's (very powerful meditation music) and then I decided to watch the rest of it, hoping I would see more of him, but no they only put him on once for a short period of time. Holosync is the only ""New Age"" thing that actually works.

Anyway, while I was waiting to see more of Bill Harris, who never came back I endured over an hour of story after bull story of people telling me of retarted ways to make money, such as writing 3 extra zero's on your money etc.

I guess americans are so busy visualising or imagining expensive cars or houses etc, that they forget to visualise or imagine world peace or an end to poverty etc, that maybe why we don't have peace or prosperity in third world countries, cause everyone is imagining for their own selfish benefit.

To my pleasure I discovered that it's basically about setting goals, putting your mind on things and gradually working towards them. It isn't a ""get rich fast"" scheme they are presenting but a wake up call to the fact that the whole Universe and what's in it is connected and each and every one of us can make a difference, both for themselves and others.

In the movie, they say, if you ask, it will be GIVEN to you by the ""universe."" That is just completely not true. It does not empasize the fact that you must also act upon any idea that comes to you that could make your dreams come true.

If your dream is to become a millionaire, the idea in the movie is that if you visualize yourself as a millionaire, it will eventually happen. What it doesn't address in enough detail is that as you visualize, your brain will attempt to come up with ideas that will help you become a millionaire. Unless you act upon those ideas, you will not become a millionaire.

Taste is a bad analogy as it implies harmlessness. Rather, reading this book (or watching the DVD for that matter) is akin to having your eyes carved out with rusty spoons. It is patronizing, insulting to the intelligence of anything more intellectually inclined than a tortoise. Actually that's being somewhat insulting to the tortoise. Its written simply, in the most bulleted, childish, infomercial-ist way possible. Basically, the WORST get-rich-quick scheme I've ever seen. And so conspiracy-esque that I wouldn't be surprised to see Tom Cruise show up in the credits, partnered with M. Night Shamylan. And ... my favourite claim of the novel is, by far, the idea that non-Western cultures are poor and disadvantaged simply because they have not had the audacity to pick up and read Byrne's book. A little harsh don't you think?

Please don't waste your money ... you're better off buying Paris Hilton's book - this one makes her look like the next Salman Rushdie.",1180310400,10,1119,5.081521739130435

1610650,5,B00005JPJ8,"If not for the Secret, I would never have heard about its source. The story begins with the poor downtrodden producer who receives a book from her daughter, takes a glimpse at it and becomes enthralled, with life-changing consequences. Being a curious and logical person, I wanted to know what that book was... Surprisingly, there is absolutely no reference to it. We learn that there is something called the Law of Attraction, but again we are given no clue about who came with that notion. You wonder how something so important as the Law of Gravity could have remained hidden for so long... (Try to keep the Law of Gravity a secret!) Nothing like a little Googling to discover what the Book is: it is called The Law of Attraction and you can find it right here at Amazon in written and audio versions. It was written by Esther and Jerry Hicks, 19 years ago I believe. So this is the secret behind the Secret: Rhonda Byrne approached the Hicks to make a documentary about the Law of Attraction for Australian TV. Gradually other former students and admirers of the Hicks were added to the documentary. The original run of the DVD featured the Hicks extensively. After they printed the first 200,000 copies, Rhonda's team of attorneys figured out that the Hicks were getting too much free exposure and wanted to renegotiate the terms of the contract, or else they would edit out every reference to the Hicks. Their reply was, predictably, do as you wish... The new version is ironically called ""extended"" when the most important segments were removed. Take whole grain flour, strip it from its most important nutrients, then sell it as ""enriched"" white flour, which is not good for your health. For me, the true revelation is Esther and Jerry Hicks' work, which is not at all materialistic... you'll find out for yourself... Anyway, I would never have discovered them if not for Rhonda Byrne, that's why she gets five stars.",1180310400,7,1925,4.749253731343283
1610651,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is an indepth, common sense compendium of ""Sage Wisdom"" passed down through almost every major religion and philosophy throughout recorded history. It addresses these subjects in a much broader, all encompassing context referred to as ""Universal Law"".  The Secret...The Message is that our thoughts create our reality.  Quauntum physicists agree that everytime we have a thought we create a molecule.  Be careful what you think about. Train your mind to think of what you want...not what you don't have or what you are afraid of. The power of this concept properly harnessed and channeled could truly ""Change the World"" (Eric Clapton).-P.J. Sullivan",1180310400,3,654,5.330097087378641

1610653,1,B00005JPJ8,"After watching this presentation, one word was prominent in my mind. Disturbing.

It's disturbing for a number of reasons. As others have stated, there is clearly a self-centered and materialistic vibe from the whole presentation. The truth is that true happiness is not derived from wealth or objects. It's hard not to view the presentation as hedonistic new age non-sense.

Extravagant claims are made about the science behind ""the law of attraction,"" but in reality there is no real science behind any of this, simply ideas. I understand science doesn't have all the answers, but these guys are saying does back these findings. Simply not true. Viewers are so excited and these talking heads so smooth that it's easy to take these folks' word for it. Please ask yourself what sound reasons you have to believe in any of this.

Also, as many others have stated, we are required to accept that everyone in life has attracted their fortunes and misfortunes...yes...6 million Jews were asking for the holocaust, etc. Close your books, turn off the CDs and DVDs, and really take a good look at what you're being asked to believe.

The POSITIVE THINKING + ACTION component is definitely a positive aspect of THE SECRET, but it doesn't cancel out the mistruths. In life, what it is that we are all seeking one way or another is happiness. Changing the way you think is a huge step to this, but I urge you to not put your faith in this material. I know we are all hoping the universe has a quick and easy fix for our lives, but it requires work over time.

1610723,2,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret has a lot of things going for it.  It emphasizes the importance of thinking positively and acting with confidence.  It encourages people to affirm the abundance in their lives and to be grateful for what they already have.  All of those are good things.  If we think negatively and feel depressed, we're not likely to have amazing outcomes.

On the other hand, there are times when people work as hard as they possibly can but encounter numerous obstacles.  If they don't succeed because they struggle against systemic racism, poverty, discrimination or debilitating illness, it's not their fault and there's no way that they can talk themselves out of that situation.  They might be able to deal with it better but I preferred the more rational thoughts of Norman Vincent Peale to The Secret because he never blamed anyone and he was always sane and rational about who could and who couldn't further themselves.

There's a reason that the serenity prayer became very popular in 12 step programs and that's because there really are some things that we CAN control and other things that we CAN'T.  Rape, child abuse, sudden dismissal from a job, a spouse dying, working at a crappy job for minimum wage... those things are out of many people's control.  When we get into Third World issues, applying The Secret becomes ludicrous.  Can we feed Ethiopians, eradicate HIV, boost sagging economies that are strangulated with debt?  Hardly.  No matter how much someone with AIDS in Kenya affirms that he is healthy, he won't be!

Don't get me wrong.  I own The Secret and have watched it several times.  For middle-class folks who are reasonably healthy, it's possible that the techniques here can make them happier and more successful.  Having an attitude of expectancy is always a good thing unless we blame ourselves when our dreams don't materialize and we never had a chance in the first place.

Personal responsibility is taken to a new level here, and it is refreshing and desperately needed in today's world.  While I find Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting, one of the best books ever written on this subject, I think The Secret will expose this philosophy to millions of people who will not be able to ignore their power any longer!",1179792000,,584,4.4392523364485985
1610726,5,B00005JPJ8,"I used to be a skeptic, and, as such, I had pretty much decided that all of those wealthy self-help gurus were full of it.  I'd decided that they were just lucky enough to have convinced enough people to buy their books, tapes, etc., to make some money and they used that money to market more products and  their fabulous wealth was just the result of a snowball effect.

And then I began to let go of fear.  To think positively.  To behave as if the universe would grant my every wish.  And it's happening.  I'm happier.  I've changed careers and taken a 50% paycut, but somehow my lifestyle is the same.  I've progressed faster and farther in my new career than I'd thought possible.  In fact, if you'd told me beforehand where I'd be now, I'd have laughed at you.

And *then* I read and saw ""The Secret"" and I find that it just confirms and reinforces what I had already started to do.

If you don't believe the mysticism, just take it as applied psychology - your brain will work better and take you farther in life if you think this way.  Those happy and successful gurus peddling their self-help products?  Their success isn't luck, it's excellence, and excellence will never come if you don't reach for it, and you won't reach for it if you don't Believe.",1179792000,5,1262,4.430434782608696

1610779,5,B00005JPJ8,"Within the first 15 minutes of watching the Secret, I had to hit pause and discuss thoughts that were already flowing through my mind.  I realized how powerful law of attraction is because it happens every day, I just didn't know about it.  Unfortunately, if you don't know it exist, negativity can be a powerful thing and it all makes sense to me now.  As I live my life now, no matter what happens in my day, I am able to control my feelings and thoughts... some would call it positive thinking and it goes hand in hand.  My life is 100% better and you more often will find me with a smile on my face than a frown.  If I have a frown, I take immediate action to change my thoughts to create a smile.  Therefore, the $29.95 I spent to watch this dvd was very much worth it.  After that, I bought the book and I have highlighted points in the book and look at it often.

I enjoyed the first film more because I preferred Esther Hicks interpretations and her input from Abraham.  However, that being said.....it is one gift that we should all give ourselves and those we love and care about.

1610784,1,B00005JPJ8,"A friend bought me this DVD and I watched it with an ""oh no, here we go again"" incredulous feeling. I grew up in a family that embraced this type of thinking for generations, and I can tell you positive prayers, visualization and believing in miracles has a dark side too. I whole-heartedly accept that realizing our own power is critical to happiness and well-being, but knowing and accepting our limits are critical too -- it's essential to loving ourselves and others. This 'The Secret' slant is one-sided: a sunny ""If I want it, it must be good, so I deserve and I will have it"" kind of philosophy that is intoxicating with all the usual pros and cons attached to things that are intoxicating -- Paris Hilton or Brittany anyone?  All this wishful thinking can become dishonesty and a form of disconnect with yourself and the bigger world. Things that are difficult, challenging, uncomfortable, humbling to do and think also help us grow, connect with us others and provide the information we need. As a kid and adult I saw New Agey people ignore illnesses, family crisis and out of control behaviors because that would 'give power to negativity', so they prayed and meditated on positive thoughts and feelings only to have their worlds crash down around them. It can devolve into callousness and equate spirituality with wealth (so the person with the biggest bank account was now both superior materially AND spiritually -- and have you known or spend time with wealthy people? Not necessarily spiritually evolved! :). The people whom I've seen with fruitful lives are also willing to embrace the hardships of this earth equally, they don't blame or deny themselves or others for what is dark but work with the reality. I'm a big believer in embracing Life/God/our higher selves more than most of us do today, allowing space for miracles we might close down on otherwise. My point is life, spirituality and meaning are bigger than this materialistic, hedonistic, magical thinking -- just keep balance as you absorb the possibilities of your own personal power because this is only part of the story in expressing the best of ourselves in this world.",1179619200,8,2154,4.853260869565218

1610861,5,B00005JPJ8,"My wife first discovered The Secret while watching Oprah.  She forgot about it shortly after until some very trying times came up with her aging parents. She needed something to help her cope and The Secret came to her mind so she ordered the book. After the book she ordered the video. I have never seen her so committed to a concept in all of our 32 years of marriage.

After realizing how happy she had become and after receiving several unexpected checks in the mail, I decided to give it a try. I must say I have not been so happy and content since I was on antidepressents.

The video is certainly dramatic at some points (some would say melodramatic)and I'm sure the intent is meant well. They intend to capture the attention of millions who can't react to something unless it is sensationalized on film...such is our society. The truth is still there.

In my carreer as a manager for many years, I have read and viewed hundreds of inspirational and motivational books and films. In truth, I've heard it all before. Somehow this film has captured not just the intellectual side of things but the emotional and spritual as well.

Some of the images in the film are absolutely stunning (I suspect stock footage in many scenes). The music reaches deep into your emotions. The true pleasure of the film, to my mind, are the teachers who appear. They are strong, positive, electrifying personalities who are extraordinary in their committment.

My personal favorite is Lisa Nichols. She simply exudes hope and love and success. She gripped my heart and mind more than any other. Others that spoke clearly to me were Bob Proctor, Jack Canfield, Dr. Joe Vitale. This is not to detract from the others, who are powerful messengers in there own ways.

My wife and I have set some very specific goals for the universe. We expect fully to achieve them and will update this review at that time.  We have shared this concept with our children and a few others.  Many scoff at the idea and we do not preach. We expect to demonstrate by example.

The mind is a powerful thing and the general population only uses an average of 10% of their brain power.  When you watch this, watch with an open mind and think about the possibilities and what they are actually saying.  There's good truth to it.  All it takes is believing, deciding to do it and sticking with it.  Finding other people to share with will help you stay on the path and start seeing amazing results.  There's a saying, ""With God, all things are possible.""  Well, when we consider that God is basically like Star Wars', ""The Force"", then we start to realize that yes, all things are possbile.  All it takes is changing the way we think.  The way we feel and the way we react.

Also.. it's not smart to say things against ourselves, like.. ""Nothing good ever happens to me"", or, ""That's just my luck"" (if something bad happened), or, ""this day is terrible"", etc, etc.  Put it in the past.  ""This day HAD BEEN terrible"", or, ""I HAD some bad luck earlier."", etc.  There's always a way to change the speech to turn it into something good.  And if something bad happened, if we say, ""Well, even though I loved that dish, when it broke, at least I didn't fally on it and cut my throat"".  It changes the way we feel about something that normally would have affected us negatively.  And we all know it's better to feel good inside.  That's a no brainer.

The Secrect promtes outlandish ideas about the power of ""positive thinking"" - claiming support from history, science, religion, philoshophy etc. In the DVD we are told that this ""secret"" has been passed down through the ages, and many famous people throughout history have known it's power. It doesn't give us ONE solid qualification for these ""facts"" of course, apart from a few of the usual feel good testimonies of changed lives as a result.

The Secret is worse than bad, it is downright scary!! That so many seemly well educated people in the Western World would fall for such Pseduo-Pop ideas is a testimony to the power of poular media, and shows the extent that the desire for material wealth now has over peoples lives.

If you are reading the book, or watching the DVD, please think about what these people are saying - really think about it for a second...",1179360000,3,1081,4.533333333333333

This video has helped me understand why the most important circumsntances in my past were attracted by my thoughts.

I only do not agree about the point of view that the law of attraction combined with myself become like God or creators, because i sincerlly believe that i did not create the world and its echosystem, the fruits and the vitamins they contain to nurture my body (just as an example).

I see the law of attraction as a world powerful principle as gravety or other invisible law.

The Secret reminds us to focus in the positive side of life and if you use it as a tool and not just as another video, it will make positive and radical changes to your life. But remember not to lose your sight on the eternal side of life that comes through accepting Jesus as your saver.

They have the same way of promising so much, and promoting so well to such a large target market. And if you meet someone who doesn't believe and refuses to believe, well it's their loss.

This is one of the most disgusting, pseudo-scientific, psedo-psychological programs/lifestyles currently doing the rounds.

The implication that anyone who is struggling is responsible for their situation is reprehensible and shows like Oprah and Larry King are just showing where their so called journalist credentials lie ($$$$$) by even having it on their shows.

It is propaganda for the vulnerable and gullible.

Instead of encouraging an original idea or even real action, this absurd and well marketed doctrine is little less than a money spinner, collecting cash from  those that can least afford it whilst the creators and promoters fill their pockets.",1179273600,6,948,5.163398692810458

I wish I could say that I was ready for this information earlier in my life, but that would be wishful thinking, indeed. I had to be prepared to be faced with the concept that I have this level of responsibility, not to mention this level of ability.

The Secret movie is a good place to start the journey of coming to grips with the nature of reality. It's somewhat less technical, more touchy feel-y than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-Bleep-Do-We-Know/dp/B0006UEVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the Bleep Do We Know!?</a>, and is a good place to begin to explore the idea of the connection between thoughts and events. It is somewhat limited in scope by virtue of the fact that it's a movie. This is actually a good thing. If you're not ready for the paradigm shift, you won't have ""wasted"" a lot of time. If you are ready... the doors are flung wide open, and the Rabbit Hole is deeper than you can imagine.

The book or audio book is a good next step, and very helpful with more detail on the concepts, and more information on what concrete steps one can use to take advantage of the way our universe is constructed. They're also helpful for reference purposes, as it's a bit time consuming to pop in your DVD and navigate to the spot you need to re-absorb to counteract some restricting habit you're trying to expunge.

1610926,5,B00005JPJ8,"""The secret"" is a seminar giving a receipe on how to make your innermost wishes come true. It presents the univeral ""law of attraction"", which essentially say that ""energy flows where attention goes"" and that it is operating whether you believe it or not. THis law is absolutely true 'cause I've seen the magic in my life both in respect of good tings and bad things coming as a response of my thinking and feeling. However I can see that people can be triggered to not like this film because they have a great deal of bad things/traumas happening in their life. And can thinking patterns and feelings do anything about it? YES it can, but first we need to forgive and accept the past and present. We need to let go of bad experiences from the bottom of our hearts and instead be greatful for what we have. Energy can be turned, but that implies that we first got to find the love, forgiveness, happiness within. Many people will need help to find their inner strenght from seeing a therapist or an alternative practitioner. So this film will not make you find inner peace unless you search for it through meditation or other forms of contemplation. A thin layer of positive thinking will not help if the heart is closed of inner anger, depression, hate or lies. So stay open for the message in this film. Look at it over and over again to remind you of how ENERGY works. Start loving yourself and be greatful for all the good things you have... and the magic will reveal itself. I'm 100% sure. Write down your wishes to the universe and energy will give it to you if you FEEL you deserve it. We have recently bought a house that ""came to us"" without searching at the open marked, and it was just what we asked for!! So the film is telling the truth.. whether you like it or not ;-)",1179187200,4,1782,4.386706948640484

The teaching of the Secret recognises a universal law at work but not the creator of the law. Who is the God and Father of Jesus Christ.",1179014400,,368,3.9066666666666667
1611079,4,B00005JPJ8,"I see positive and negative aspects to this book. I buy into the energy concept that causes us to reflect the feelings of those around us unless we become aware of what we are doing. I also think that we repeat patterns in relationships because we communicate with an energy of what we believe about ourselves, resulting in others fulfilling our self-beliefs. Listening to the book caused me to take a fresh look at some of the negative self-messages I carry, and I found that helpful.

I don't believe that abundance is about money necessarily. As others have mentioned, that leads to narcissism as a focus and can create negative energy. Perhaps you can create material wealth by focusing on it; many have--but is that the valuable use of this power? I believe that abundance is about having everything you need to fulfill your destiny--your purpose on earth. I think that is the underpinning of the spiritual concept. For some, that purpose may involve wealth, especially if an aspect of their destiny is to give. For others like Mother Theresa, that purpose involves a vow of poverty. If a person is consumed by debt and other financial challenges that are detracting from his or her destiny, then rethinking negative thoughts toward finances is critical. I found the comments useful for that reason. (BTW, Jesus was a millionaire? Huh?)

I also agree with reviewers who said that the fat comment was inappropriate. I suffer from chronic pain throughout my body as a result of a car accident, and I had a friend reject me after taking THE COURSE IN MIRACLES. It was devastating. My low energy apparently did not bring her joy. I isolated myself for some time, assuming that I was harming others by exposing them to my pain. I finally realized that some life is better than no life, and picked myself up off the couch.

I do not believe that negative thinking caused my car accident or the resulting pain. (Some guy whose windshield was not defrosted pulled out from a gas station into traffic, realized a car was coming, stuck his monster-of-a-car into reverse and slammed into my little Chevette.)

What I realize is that I can rot in despair or believe that, at least for now, this frustrating situation is developing an understanding, wisdom, and compassion in me that is part of my destiny, which is my abundance in the midst of suffering. I function much better when I can achieve an attitude of appreciation for a greater good rather than bitterness and despair.

Although I disagree with the guilt-inducing concept of negativity causing disaster and disease, the book reminded me to keep a positive focus, despite my circumstances. (BTW, how many of the people used as examples experienced periods of adversity? Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King were both assassinated. The reality is that death comes for all humans, no matter how much they believe in abundance and manifestation. That means at some point, at least one body part has to fail. Furthermore, should we avoid those with pain and suffering because of their low energy? What if Mother Teresa had decided to stay away from the poor and infirmed because they brought down her energy level? She gave from her abundance, and she was replenished with the power of a waterfall. Everyone who has given to those in need understands the beauty of this concept.)

Overall, I enjoyed this book on audio--liked the various voices and sound effects. The DVD was artful, but did not have the in-depth content of the book.

The message is generally valuable and touching. I hope that people keep a balanced perspective as they read or listen. My field is special education, and I especially hope that is true for parents of a child with a disability. You did not cause that to happen. When Jesus was asked who had sinned to cause a person's disability, he replied that it was for the glory of God. Your child has a purpose in this life.",1179014400,4,3899,4.767407407407408

If you are insecure and feeling that everything in your life is wrong get this movie it will show you how to make it right. I highly recommend this movie to all of those out there who needs to find the road to happiness.,1178928000,2,559,3.9035087719298245
1611231,5,B00005JPJ8,"My review will be short (I hope)

I bought this movie because of all the hype and the fact that my hubby won't read a book, but he'll watch a movie.  A lot of the concepts in here I have heard before and known all along.  But... they have given it a 'face lift'.  The movie is really easy to relate to. We have watched it several times just to keep us in the groove with the Universe.

I say if you are looking for answers, need to be more positive, The Secret explains it all in a way we can all understand.  This movie is very well done.",1178928000,3,539,3.8990825688073394

It is a principle that was established with the foundations of the universe, an immutable truth that has been spoken forth as creation itself.  The presenters in this wonderful piece, coming from such diverse backgrounds, bring to light this truth in a way that it seems like a new revelation, even though it is as old as the ages.  Prior to viewing this movie, I understood the ""Secret"" intellectually, but now it is a part of my entire being and I will use it's guidance for the rest of my days.",1178928000,2,606,4.401785714285714

1611292,4,B00005JPJ8,"There is nothing new in The Secret. All of us already know that not only thinking positively, but directing positive energy towards the goals we want to achieve, the people we want to influence, the good health and prosperity we want to attract, and the life we want to lead is the most important step we can take in gaining what we need and desire. The problem is that in the stress and jumble of living our lives, we forget how much control we hold over what happens with the power of our thoughts. Whether The Secret is plagurizing old, already established beliefs and philosophies, and recycling them with New Age spin is irrelevant. In the end what it says has real value and it is an excellent reminder that energy is a mysterious thing. Strong, positive energy attracts strong positive results, and at the very least, it makes living our lives much more pleasant.",1178928000,,870,4.619354838709677

Hats off to the author/producer and many of the contributors who have simplified many Universal Truth Priniciples herein. The Secret is nothing new and is a beginning journey for many. The more people that get know know these prinicples and laws the better off the world will be.  The one thing that the producers/authors quickly scan over is the premise of developing a spiritual consciousness is the key to lasting prosperity, abundance, and wealth.

1611362,5,B00005JPJ8,"I have watched The Secret over and over, and listen to it through my stereo when I can't watch it on T.V.  I had read the Dynamic Laws of Prosperity before and it had changed my life in dramatic ways!! Besides changing other people's lives when they read it.  I had lost my footing and someone recommended The Secret to me.  I had begun reading The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity again, but wanted more influence back into positive thinking!  I know we are all spiritual beings who have the power to bring to us either the negative or postive, I am not talking about natural disasters either, but our own personal experiences.  The Secret showed me how to change my way of thinking, and instead of worrying about things, think the opposite, in that everything was going to get better.  Does this work?  YES!! No matter what others say, as some people would rather everyone live under someone elses control and influence, other than their own.  The Secret has gotten me back in control of my life, and I recommend it to EVERYONE, who wants to change their life for the better!

Yes, I have had dramatic life changing experiences, first from the Dynamic Law of Prosperity book, (it is the same exact premise as The Secret), all based on spirituality.  When I first read it, I had just lost everything in a hurricane, and had no insurance nor money.  Within a year of the hurricane and reading the book, I had a 100 acre farm and making money in a great job, besides traveling the world.  The things just happened naturally, I did not force anything, it just came to me without me having to try.  Knowing through our own way of thinking either things can come naturally - from money, love etc, or we can live in stress from thinking in the negative.  I choose to think positive, and know all the great things of the world will come to me naturally and I will never have to force it.

Don't listen to others who live their life thinking negative, and say The Secret is a bad thing!  IT IS NOT!  It is positive, and you can choose how your life will be led, will you be happy or stressed out?  It is all in our own thoughts, and The Secret helps us change those thoughts, so we can all live a glorious life!!  I choose, glory and love, over stress and being negative!  I hope you do too, as the world can change, when people live in harmony with each other through our way of thinking and choosing how to live our lives with each other.

Please put aside those negative naysayer reviews and look at The Secret with an opened mind!  Also consider Dynamic Laws of Prosperity too!!",1178755200,6,2569,4.398305084745763

1611365,5,B00005JPJ8,"The slick packaging and promotion of ""The Secret"" has led many to reject the movie and book as new age fluff. As experienced practitioners of intention, we hope that readers will not allow the hype to cheat them of the opportunity to create the life they really want. The information presented in both the book and movie goes far beyond positive thinking and moves into the realm of quantum physics.  Whether we wish to acknowledge it or not, our lives are on the verge of a dramatic paradigm shift based on emerging quantum discoveries. This is a shift none of us will escape, so we must ask ourselves if we are willing to move forward with it, or remain firmly planted in the past. Ms. Byrne's intention may have been better served by adding information pertaining to the scientific basis for the laws of attraction and intention, but, as Wallace Wattles points out in ""The Science of Getting Rich,"" you don't have to understand exactly how these laws operate; you just have to do the work.

When we first came to understand the laws of attraction and intention, our lives appeared to be near their ends. Since then, we have used these laws to surmount Multiple Sclerosis, Lupus, Bipolar disorder and completely recover from a massive brain hemorrhage that was considered fatal. We have also used these laws to draw jobs, experiences and houses with outcomes that have always been better than we had imagined. Is the theory simple? Yes! Was it easy? No, but well worth the effort. When detractors label ""The Secret"" a form of repacked positive thinking, it is obvious that they have not attempted to make the changes in their thinking, emotions and actions needed to effectively utilize these laws. Every successful practitioner will tell you that following the steps outlined in ""The Secret"" means you will need to change virtually every aspect of your present life. If you've ever tried to change a habit, you know how difficult that can be. Our brains become chemically addicted to our present thought patterns and actively resist any changes. By thinking new thoughts, feeling new emotions and taking different actions we rewire our brains and draw new experiences. But anyone who has rewired a house knows that the experience can be messy and uncomfortable until the new wiring is in place. If you commit to doing whatever it takes to get through the process, it will work.

Critics may point to the self-serving nature of the movie and book, claiming that the world is not served when we merely seek more for ourselves. If a person uses the information contained in ""The Secret"" strictly for self aggrandizement, we would have to agree. Never the less, we cannot offer anything to others that we do not posses ourselves. If you are miserable, sick, negative and fearful, you offer misery, sickness, negativity and fear to everyone and everything in the world.  Jesus clearly understood this principle and told his followers that they would receive only what they gave to others.  Choosing to do the work that makes joy, peace, love and abundance the foundation of our lives, can truly be the greatest gift we give to others.

As a therapist and trainer with Australian Institute of Self Development I recommend it to many of my clients. It has a grabbing theatrical start showing the secret being being hidden, coveted and suppressed over the ages then settles into an explanation of The Law Of Attraction. Essentially it teaches how our thoughts create or attract whatever we focus on. Having used and taught Attraction for over 7 years it does work.

However The Secret fails to give the viewer any effective means of changing  limiting thoughts, beliefs and emotions and so is missing ""the other half of the secret"", so it's like a hot sports car with the transmission missing. For that you're going to need to learn NLP, EFT etc.

Still The Secret is an effective tool to get this simple powerful concept out to the masses, and that it does very well. Russell",1178668800,3,916,4.7125

1611500,3,B00005JPJ8,"I did enjoy this dvd and I found it inspiring for people who forget they can be grateful for what they have and be more positive. As a psychology student I can tell you that we don't tell people that they are causing the trauma they are experiencing, that can cause a person to get much worse. However, we do want them to stop their negative thought patterns and start using positive thought patterns to stop the depression and help them cope and be able to live healthier lives. I am not going to question God on what he will grant someone for believing, that is not my job. But scientists have studied the brain for years and actually have proven that positive thoughts help cause balance in the body, physcially and can improve health, and yes it improves relationships, and you will draw more people to you. Do you have to activate the process? yes.

The third law of physics states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you stop thinking negative thoughts then the reaction should and will be positive thinking. I have tried this method and I have some amazing things happen that I couldn't explain, but I also created some of my own outcomes by taking steps to improve my thoughts and my actions. I am still researching this concept with other authors who have written books about the law of attraction but were not in the movie.

I have researched the people in the movie and yes it seems that some are trying to make money off of it but still their are some of them that are interested in the research, and using it to futher the study of positive thought, you have to understand that some people will try to ""cash in"" on the concept while others really want to help. You choose what you believe in.

I do recommend this dvd to people, my only drawback about it is the way they tell people they caused their own pain and suffering. We all experience traumatic events, remaining positive is hardest during that time but dwelling in that event with negative thoughts causes the suffering. We have to be careful how we approach some victims and help them to positive thinking, if you tell them they caused thier trauma, you will only make some individuals worse.",1178496000,2,2195,4.510050251256281

Is it time to go on a metaphysical ""which hunt"" and try to find out ""which thought, which error"" has tainted my belief system and created obstacles and prevented me from attaining the perfect life? And what is the perfect life? Is it one where there's lots and lots of money? OR is it one where there's lots and lots of fame? Or is the perfect life the EASY life?

What would have happened if we'd shared THE SECRET with the survivors at Auschwitz as they walked out of the death camps? Or perhaps offered it to a parent with a critically ill child? Or someone who's lost a limb in a tragic accident? I suspect they'd deeply resent being told that their thoughts brought these difficulties upon themselves and into their world.

Despite having read hundreds and hundreds of books on this ""name it and claim"" it philosophy, I've come to believe that there are some folks who are here for the advanced course on spirituality (which may look like being confronted with life's most-challenging lessons). To the casual observer, it may appear that these dear ones have more than their share of problems. And yet - I have *never* met ANYONE who is interesting, wise, profound, insightful, spiritually minded and spiritually advanced - who had an ""easy"" (obstacle-free) life.

Corrie ten Boom (a survivor of Auschwitz) said that (paraphrasing): One learns much when the lessons are hard. Or as another reviewer here (Old Soul) said, ""some of the challenges are put in our path FOR us, not by us.""

Basically, The Secret didn't tell me much that I haven't learned in 67 years of living; but it DID change the way that I look at things & events. It brings a LOT of good, well-known knowledge together & has changed the way that I think about things & the way that I present myself & my views to the world.

1611578,3,B00005JPJ8,"This is the first Amazon review I've ever written.  As a collector of this genre of writing and video, I have to say that the Secret is only really useful for people who have never been exposed to the concept of manifestation.  If you have seen What the Bleep, then you will probably be disappointed with The Secret.  It's not the the ideas go too far wrong, but The Secret is very repetitive and overly simplified.  It seems like a very watered down version of What the Bleep with an over-dusting of the DaVinci Code thrown in.  I take issue with the idea that ""The Secret"" would ever be kept a secret by those in the know.  The Secret is that the universe is abundant.  If you really understood the concept - and lived it - you'd have no reason to hide the secret.  You'd want to share it.  Also, The Secret is very focused on material posessions.  Please!  Is this what we need to be pumping into America?  Get What the Bleep.  Read Sonia Choquette's Your Heart's Desire.  Even get Michael Losier's book.  And if you like the Secret, go further with the concept.  There is so much more that awaits you.  Also, there is a very good chance that each of us comes to the planet with certain lessons to learn.  If so, there will be some challenges put in our path for us, not BY us.  And that's OK, its not your fault and you didn't cause it with misdirected thinking.  Take heart, folks, and take this one for what it is - a very basic introduction to being the creator of your own life.

1611631,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've been a huge fan of the movie, ""The Secret,"" which I believe is an outstanding introduction to the principles of the Law of Attraction.  The book is a nice addition to the concepts explored in the movie, but in my opinion, the DVD is a much more inspiring presentation of the material.  In particular, I own the ""original version"" of the DVD and think it's superior to the newest edition.

While The Secret has become a worldwide phenomenon, showing it has incredible appeal for those wanting to improve their lives, it has also received criticism from people who believe it over-simplifies what it takes to make change happen.

Readers wanting more depth regarding Law of Attraction books can seek out ""Ask and It is Given,"" by Esther Hicks, ""The Attractor Factor,"" by Joe Vitale,"" or ""Quantum Success"" by Sandra Taylor.  If you're looking for more science to back up what you're learning, try ""The Intention Experiment"" by Lynne McTaggart, or the more spiritual, ""The Divine Matrix,"" by Gregg Braden.

And, if you're looking for great resources that are not Law of Attraction specific, but are life changing in themselves, try some of the literature in the realm of Positive Psychology (like Martin Seligman's ""Authentic Happiness""), a field based exclusively on what research says works to transform your mind and your life.

There's something for everyone out there...we all just need to find the right mix of information, science, and practicality to serve our unique needs.  The Secret is a wonderful introduction to the Law of Attraction principles...then it's time to seek out the resources that help deepen your understanding so you can lead a life you love.",1178323200,2,1671,4.985611510791367
1611632,4,B00005JPJ8,"My husband and I watched this online before purchasing our own copy.  Intrigued by the idea that the Law of Attraction was as real as the Law of Gravity, we immediately put it to the test.  We wrote several things  that we wanted or needed for our upcoming move upon a large white board.  One by one, we erased them as they entered into our experience.  It was pretty exciting.  The last item on the list was a car-top carrier.  As the white board was taken down from the wall, I sighed and erased the last of the writing so that it could be loaded onto the moving truck.  A day later, we pulled into my husband's sister's house in Tulsa to rest for the night.  The next morning as we were loading up the car to continue on our way, my sister-in-law said, ""You need a car-top carrier.""  I said, ""I know what you mean.  It is pretty crowded in there.""  She said, ""I have one, but I think Stacey (her daughter)has it.""  I shrugged and said, ""No problem.""  But then she went into her garage and came back with---the car-top carrier.  My husband and I just looked at eachother and said simultaneously, ""It's the Secret.""",1178064000,4,1116,4.323671497584541
1611633,5,B00005JPJ8,"The film is about the ""law of attraction."" This is neither new nor is it a secret. However, aspects of it are quite useful. The movie ""The Secret"" does a very good job at introducing you to the law of attraction concepts. It just provides something that books can't provide...visuals. Unfortunately, the DVD makes the mistake of oversimplifying the concepts and then steers too close to the realm of ""magic"" for my comfort. Still, for delivering the concepts so effectively, I have to give it five stars!

This is a video that one has to take in appropriate perspective. The film does not teach you how to get rich quick, or find the love of your life, or get the house of your dreams. Unfortunately, it DOES seem to promise outlandish things like that at times. What the film DOES tell you is how to improve your outlook on life and improve your karma. If you are entirely skeptical about things like karma, ""flow"" (or whatever you want to call it) and other intangibles, you will probably not like The Secret.

It requires an open mind and a bit of common sense to sort out what parts of the concepts are useful to you. Discard the rest. Even the people that made the film would tell you the same. This movie only directs you in ways to improve your state of mind so that you are more open to improving your own life.

This video is just another in a long list of examples of how the mind of humanity has become so [...]: if the suppositions of this video were true, there would be no suffering in the world. For if everything is manifested by our thoughts, then who is creating all the poverty, starvation, war, deforestation, and worse? The followers of this latest fad ignore the basic law of all matter and energy: there are consequences for our every action. It is true that ""we become what we think"" (as Buddha said) - but the problem is that we fail to realize that what we are now is a result of flawed thinking. Thus it makes sense to first recognize our flaws and change them, otherwise we will continue to deepen the suffering of the world.  What else is every religion saying but that?

1611636,1,B00005JPJ8,"If there were zero stars, I would rate it zero.

First of all, not only is this not a ""secret,"" (Power of Postive Thinking, Affirmations, Buddhist concept of ""right thought"", Create Your Own Reality - sound familiar?), but obviously it hasn't been kept from people at all. I will agree that positive thinking can *help* you - it does affect your interactions with people; a positive outlook has been shown also to have a positive effect on things like blood pressure, immune response and the like. But The Secret goes way, way too far. The Secret claims that simple positive thinking literally will fix everything. Life is just not that simple, folks. Quit being lazy and looking for an easy way out.

Secondly, I find the whole concept that bad things happen to people because that's what was in their thoughts utterly offensive and perverse. The people in this film were insistent that every single time your thoughts and what happens to you match up.

Furthermore, they claimed that the universe was governed by ""one law, the Law of Attraction"", that everything in the universe is about attraction. This couldn't be further from the truth. As my friend pointed out, ""what about the law of 'opposites attract?'"" Also, like charges repel each other; they don't attract. Last but definitely not least - the very fact that the attractive force of gravity is much weaker than the repulsive strong and weak forces is why the universe has the form it has today. If not for the forces pushing neutrons and protons away from each other, the atomic nucleus would collapse. Matter as it is today would not exist. This changes the entire universe. It's actually more correct to say that the universe is governed by the Law of Repulsion.

I am also bothered that the main focus of the film appears to be about attracting material wealth and lovers to oneself - a very self-centered focus.  How about we visualize world peace, and the end of poverty and war?  What happens when two people imagine conflicting things equally well?  Who ""wins?""",1177891200,20,2031,4.785714285714286
1611637,4,B00005JPJ8,"Some people say that its no secret, that there is nothing new. Others say that its all hype. Many say that its worth every penny.

It is a concentrated happy pill in that you feel good about yourself and of endless possibilities after watching it. Some people take happy pills better than others. Some shouldn't be taking happy pills at all.

I think that some of the negative reactions spawn from envy. Someone made a lot of money on the Secret and a lot of people think that they could have done the same. What they don't realize is that it takes a lot of hard work and talent to produce a documentary that creates such strong reactions. The Secret is not for negative people.

While I believe in the law of attraction and visualization I don't believe that you can just sit down, visualize, and wait for things to come. Its better to work with the law of attraction, visualize your goals, and then work as hard as you can to achieve those goals. Hard work breeds luck.",1177891200,17,1076,4.48469387755102
1611658,2,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret is not really a secret at all. This concept is in many new age books (anything by Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Norman Vincent Peale, Ernest Holmes and even the spritual novel ""The Destiny of Miro"".) All of these give more information and explanation on the law of attraction. This has never been hidden information and the opening sequences that seem to be like ""The Da Vinci Code"" are simply overdone. This can serve as a basic introduction. Several people discuss how believing in something has helped them to manifest certain things in their lives. The stories are inspiring but where the DVD fails is in not exploring the concept further.

Our beliefs can also limit us and keep us from what we desire. No matter how much you concentrate on being a millionaire, if you don't believe you deserve it, you won't get that big check. Knowing yourself is still your best tool. Recognize limitations in your beliefs and rid yourself of them. This must be done before you can really bring all that you want into your life.

Also whoever did this DVD never watched ""The Twilight Zone"". Be careful what you wish for. It is really more important to focus on the emotion you want to have such as being loved or feeling fulfilled or prosperous, then let the universe decide how best to give you what you need to bring you that emotion.

Now back to the BASHERS of The Secret.  The Secret never says that all you have to do in sit in a room and visualize about having more money then it will come true, The Secret doesnt SAY THAT!!!!

What The Secret DOES say is, ""Visualize with FEELING AND EMOTION of whatever you want, and opportunities will be ATTRACTED TO YOU,,then YOU must GO FOR THOSE opportunities presented.  For instance, lets say you want to make more money, visualize with emotion and feeling that you allready do have the money, drive that beat up Ford Pinto lol like its a BMW, treat you old apartment like its a new home, act like you live in a new home.  The SECRET says if you do this, opportunities will come your way, it could be a new idea that pops in your mind to make more money in your spare time, it could be running into a someone that tells you that so-and-so quit their Supervisor job that would increase your income by 50% if you applied and got it!

Thats what The Secret is.  Ya don't just think about it and it is given to you on a silver platter lol.  You visualize with feeling and EMOTION of what you want, and the universe will present you with THE OPPORTUNITIES for you to GET what you want, whether its through some business contact, or you come up with a great idea when taking a shower.

Now for the folks saying, ""Well what about the holacaust, did THEY visualize being tortured and murdered?""  ""What about the shootings at Virginia Tech, did they visualize being shot and thats why it happened?""

Of course not, quit being stupid lol.  Those are horrible tragedys, and nothing can stop those type of things.

THE SECRET deals with getting rid of negative thinking and if you focus on your crappy job,,crappy car,,dumpy apartment, then thats what you will PRODUCE in your life.  If you FOCUS on all the things in life that you DONT WANT, thats what you will produce into reality.

The last presidential election in 2004 is the PERFECT EXAMPLE!  All the Democrats did was FOCUS on hating President BUSH!  They put all their ENERGY towards what they DIDNT WANT (4 more years with Bush) and guess what happened?  Thats exactley what they got lolol.  Instead of FOCUSING on getting their guy elected, they visualized with FEELING AND EMOTION of what they didn't want, thus, President Bush was re-elected!

THE SECRET is nothing new, but i like the idea of the DVD, its nice to see other people talk about it instead of just reading the text.

Alot of other books talk about THE SECRET, Law of Attraction.  Books like, The Magic of Beleiving, The Magic of Thinking BIG, Psycho-cybernetics, Lead The Field and on and on.  All those books were written between 1950 and 1980, its time for someone to write about it again.

Take all of your attention and focus of what you DONT WANT, take all that energy and focus it on what you DO WANT outta life.

She said it had changed her life - although I didn;t see how she meant - she has always been overweight and an addict aand she still was but she said it had brought a man into her life. so I read it and tried.  I can't aford o spend mony on books but I like to read them if I think they will change my life.  well i read and I hopepd and i thought positive things - but in the sace of a month after reading this I lost one of my jobs and sliced my finger at the other one so had to tak time off that one too - and I con;t take any pan medication cause of my past drug history.  So I am down towo jobs and now in a shelter becasue I couldn;t pay my rent.  Monterray wound up at the hospital from being attacked by the new found man she mnifested for good louck  .  My good luck is that now I have all kinds of time - time when I can get into trouble again - time where i can look for a job - or two new ones casue i lost my old ones.  I guess i am just not thinking positively enough or something - I am sure it is all my faulty.  but you buy somethuign and you believe it will change and you havea buncho f reverands and holy people saying do it it is a secret.  And then your life is worse than before.  I don;t have much left to believe in  - and this didn;t help.  Go out and do something good for soembody else instead of reading this nothin - and then you will at least feel a lttle better.

Recently, I came across another documentary. It's not so much about tricks and advice but it definitely illustrates the real life application of ""The Secret"". I'm talking about the documentary ""Sanctuary Lisa Gerrard"" from Dead Can Dance. Even though, Lisa may not know it, she applies the secret!

1611663,4,B00005JPJ8,"The ""secret"" in this DVD was something that I was not aware of until 1998.  Through the short-lived television network, TPN, which broadcasted motivational, positive programming 24/7, I was introduced to the secret through many teachers (celebrities, philosophers, sports champions, successful  entrepreneurs like Famous Amos, people who had suffered severe misfortune but triumphed over it, etc.)  I literally went from feeling depressed most of the time to feeling depressed not that often.  So the info in ""The Secret"" DVD was not new to me, but the producers did a spectacular job of making the concept of the Law of Attraction totally visual and easy to understand and incorporate into one's daily life. It has already helped me and other members of my family start to tackle life differently and more successfully.  It was just hard for me to swallow Neale Donald Walsch's ""no blackboard in the sky"" analogy at the end.  He states that no one will ever stand in judgment of anything you do, now or ever.  I guess what I found most conspicuously missing in the DVD's format was the acknowledgment that evil does exist in this world and can indeed regretably influence the outcome of events.

I was skeptical, but I figured it couldn't hurt. Although I found some of it far fetched and too simplified, the basic principle of positive thinking and feeling confident has credence and power. As suggested in the DVD, rather than focusing on bills, I envisioned checks coming in the mail. Within a week I had 2 new clients and a part-time job! Although my marriage is still ending, I am OK with it and feel good about a new beginning. This DVD may not be a cure-all nor so quick and easy for everyone.

1611666,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is for the naysayer's who wrote reviews on ""The Secret"".

Larry King Live ran two episodes last November in which a number of the people who appear on the movie ""The Secret"" were guests and spoke on the law of attraction. I was in the kitchen doing dishes and at first I thought "" ...here are some folks peddling some book they wrote"". As I kept listening though I became aware that it was far more than that so I sat down to listen to the rest of the show. What these people were saying made sense to me on many levels and I felt like the blinders had been lifted from my eyes. A few days later I decided to go ahead and purchase a copy of the movie (after having viewed it online at The Secret website I knew I wanted to purchase a copy and share it with my loved ones).

The greatest thing Rhonda Byrne has done with this movie - and for which I am so eternally grateful for- is that she opened a door for many to step through and begin to begin the process of understanding ( or remembering as the great teachers called Abraham who come to us via Ester and Jerry Hicks) the law of attraction.

I do believe the title of the movie aka The Secret is compelling and on target as in some way this information was known by some very powerful people in the past who did not want others to become aware of it. All one has to do is view the scene of the movie with the smoke stacks of the great factories during the industrial revolution and watch the higher ups walk around in their suits and fancy hats while they looked on as the workers labored like worker bees to get the work done. Out of greed people who knew the secret wanted to keep it a secret because they wanted all the power. I know because at an earlier time I used to be one of the worker bees. I  always assumed and/or thought the others were smarter, more beatuful, luckier etc than I and so their lives were more  appealing in my eyes than mine. About 15 years ago I had a flash of clarity where I saw these people just thought differently than I and so that was the difference between us. A seed had been planted.

Rhonda Byrnes has made this information accessible to many who otherwise would not walk through that door and we all should give her kudos for that. Watch the movie...I also bought the CD and listened to it in my car for about a month after which I felt like I was operating on a new higher level of awareness and happiness.

The best thing is that by watching the movie I was led to the teachings of Abraham via Ester and Jerry Hicks. Abrahams teachings have brought me so much gratitude, excitment and happiness in the short time I have been tuned into them and I eagerly look forward to going to one of the workshops in about a month from now. I should sent Rhonda Byrnes a dozen roses just that!!!!

Thanks Rhonda - you've done a great servic through your vision and love for all that is.",1177459200,13,2878,4.163669064748201
1611667,4,B00005JPJ8,"Though the Secret gives a visual of how things come to you. I believe that if we a ""spiritual beings"" why wasn't there more reference to GOD! A lot of the content actually all of it can be found in the King James Bible. It gives a great visual for those of us who need more hands on and visual explanations. I enjoyed it very much and since I have applied God's word with these visuals, I have seen great change in me and those around me.",1177286400,5,438,4.045977011494253
1611688,4,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD is mainly a compendium of teachings given by various people (authors, doctors, teachers) who attribute their success to the ""Law of Attraction"" and these are edited together in an overall theme that in simple words states:  What you think about and feel is ultimately created in your life around you.

Ultimately, DVDs or books like this will be critiqued as if they are the end-all-be-all answer to our question of life, especially when they gain a lot of popularity.  It is easy to look at them that way, and I definitely see the danger and contradictions another reviewer has effectively argued.  That argument is valid, and what I would like to add is it should be noted that any theory or opinion like this, since it cannot really be proved or disproved, should be seen as a ""shadow"" of a much larger answer to our existence.  Even the major religions must be both wrong and right on some things, but are shadows of a much larger truth.

I really liked this DVD - I didn't love it, because of some inconsistencies and contradictions on the beliefs of the presenters themselves, but the overall theme is what should be focused on, while picking and choosing some of the details if you wish.  At the very least it is uplifting and hopeful.  I have watched it many times just because it feels good to watch.  I bet you will feel the same way despite any belief you may have for or against it.

But, I propose you watch this DVD for what it is - an OPINION or THEORY on how our life may fit in amongst the larger Universe of things.  Believe every word, disagree with every word, or take little bits and pieces for your own use, but at the very least please don't allow any teaching like this to be just believed or disagreed without experimenting for yourself if it works or not.  Just believing blindly amongst popularity creates nothing more that a fad, and if the information is good information, it will be eventually relegated to the ""back of the closet"" like fads eventually do, not getting the purpose it deserves.  Likewise, if the information is bad information and it is blindly followed, then it succeeded in gaining a potentially harmful life it should not have had.  Please make decisions on your own results.  I did.  I believe much of what is described in this DVD because I have found it works for me.  You should also.

Of course, we or the authors cannot know if everything this DVD tries to teach is true or not, but we can judge it according to what humans have observed since even ancient times.  In keeping with this, it has been observed that virtually every successful (economical, physical, social, emotional, spiritual etc.) person in our recorded history has not discounted the quality of what they think about.  Whether it be through positive thoughts only or prayer to gods or God, many can agree that observation has shown they work one way or another, although not all the time, and certainly not magically, but with some type of powerful emotion mixed with action.  And most societies, modern or ancient, believe one way or another in results based on the quality of their thoughts (prayer is a thought, right?).  In my mind, the theory of the Law of Attraction can be argued to be the same thing as prayer, just named differently and described the way it should be but has been watered down over many years - Positive thoughts mixed with powerful emotion, then action bringing the intended result.

I believe the teachings in this DVD are basically a new spin on what religions have been teaching for centuries - to pray - although in an updated form without the religion surrounding it.  After all, when you pray, such as for a loved one to get better from a sickness, do you just say the words or do you picture that person in your mind clearly, feeling better?  Which would be more effective?  And does God, god, Allah, the Universe care if I say an ""Our Father"" or if I just put positive images in my mind that could help others?  When I go to sleep at night, I picture my 2 year old son healthy, my wife smiling, and my job still there to support my family.  I'll never give up positive thinking mixed with strong emotion and action.  That's MY prayer, and the Secret, (Law of Attraction, prayer, positive thinking, whatever you call it) - whether you believe in it or not, it exists in one form or another, one name or another, one way or another.",1177200000,,4397,4.537389100126743

It was beyond words and I'm incorporating the Secret in my life as well as my family. I listen to the CD version while getting ready for work in the morning and at night. It has helped me immensely and I'll continue to do so. I'm so very glad that I decided to check here for the hardcover book...hooray, the price has been reduced...yipeee!

I think it was very well done but I have been exposed to these principles before, I guess I was expecting something totally new because of the name ""The Secret"".  You can find out a lot about the law of attraction, and positive thinking from Wayne Dyer and others.  Don't get me wrong this is not a meant to be negative feedback, I do accept what ""The Secret"" has laid out as being real.

1611693,4,B00005JPJ8,"I watched ""The Secret"" with coworkers, then with my family. A universal reaction is enthusiasm, tempered with a slight squint of the eyes, and a question, ""So, what did you think?"" There is an innate sense of something vital that's missing in the presentation.

The Secret takes the first principle of the Law of Attraction and plays on basic desires. Whatever you want, you attract. Granted, the authors couldn't cover all the ground to put these old ideas in new packaging to make it look like the newest craze. But we all need to remember that we are responsible to bring about the success we seek. No one else will provide that for you.

Where ""The Secret"" falls short is a simple-minded approach that raises one law above all other inevitabilities. By putting you as the most powerful force in the universe, it displaces both God and physics as governing forces. It also mis-shapes a universe that bends in illogical ways to give you whatever you wish, regardless of physical impossibility, A more balanced approach combines faith, acknowledgement of God, and exposure to past-generation Teachers of the Secret, like Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, James Allen, and Norman Vincent Peale. Of course, Jesus shared the keys in proper perspective over 2,000 years ago.

Still, ""The Secret"" is attractively designed and lays out ideas you can use to improve your outlook, your resources, and your results. Just don't expect to do any tricks like bending spoons or the universe.",1176940800,26,1472,4.951417004048583

1611695,3,B00005JPJ8,"I think this is a movie that has a lot of hype and a certain degree of truth. Speak to anyone very successful in there field and they will admit that this does not guarantee a happy life. They will ALL tell you that happiness is based on a balance of success in personal life as well as career.

And one without the other is like driving a car with 3 wheels. And success in carreer does not need to be making 6 figures. Any super hoop shooter can do this. Its about making a difference be it volunteering or cleaning trash all day. That is career success.

We need all the wheels to genuinely be happy. Also by the way career successs has a lot to do with good planning and hard work. As well as luck. Thats right luck. We can say that or we can say G-d its our choice. I find it hard to deny the presence of the creator when I just think of the most basic think a huge apple tree with fresh apples from a tiny apple seed made of basically nothing.

DNA that has millions and millions of genetics in a cell that is smaller than our amazing eyes with 120 million rods and 7 million cones can see. Each of our eyes contains this. Thats millions folks. So bottom line am I suggesting the movie has no value? No, I am not, I feel that positive thinking and focusing on gratitude and happy topics is going to lead to a happier life. The rest is a matter of good planning, taking care of ourselves and G-ds plan.

1611748,1,B00005JPJ8,"A Bugs Bunny cartoon has more depth and credibility. First of all, The Secret is hardly a secret, rather a slap in the face of thoughtful discourse on a subject that's been debated for centuries. I rented it based on the enthusiastic recommendations from co-workers, but mostly because I was looking for a cohesive and in-depth exploration of ideas that basically I buy in to.  Instead, what I got were talking head ""experts"" that include ""visionary,"" ""metaphysician"" ""life coach,"" mystery authors, and a quantum physics guy or two who might be brilliant, but are notoriously nutjobs in a controversial field.  Since this is such a telling, critical point, and that there are a couple of thousand reviews to wade through and you might miss it, here is a list of presenters from another reviewer, who got it from the IMDB:

John Assaraf - ""life"" coach
Michael Beckwith - new age author
Lee Bower - ""get rich quick"" author
Jack Canfield - ""life"" coach
John Demartini - ""get rich quick"" author
Marie Diamond - feng shui ""master"", life coach
Mike Dooley - new age author
Bob Doyle - ""get rich quick"" author
Hale Dwoskin - speaker, author
Morris and Cathy Goodman - motivational speaker
John Gray - relationship author
John Hagelin - author, seller of ""high fidelity"" audio equipment
Bill Harris - psuedo-scientist
Esther Hicks - spirit channeler, motivational speaker, author
Loral Langemeier - ""get rich quick"" author
Lisa Nichols - motivational speaker
Bob Proctor - motivational speaker, ""get rich quick"" author
James Arthur Ray - ""get rich quick"" author
David Schirmer - ""get rich quick"" author
Marci Shimoff - motivational speaker, author
Joe Vitale - self-proclaimed marketing expert
Denis Waitley - ""productivity consultant"", author
Neale Donald Walsch - new age author, speaker
Fred Alan Wolf - physicist, TV personality, has disavowed connection to The Secret

In an effort to establish credibility that simply isn't there, the redundant courtesy title faux pas throughout screams AMATEURS, accompanying every ""expert's"" name, e.g., Dr. So and So, Ph. D.  It appears to be a secret that properly it is either Dr. OR Ph. D., not both, and normally the credentials in American usage follow the name:  Myselfforexample, Ph. D.  Although some insecure Ph. D.'s and virtually all psychologists insist on being addressed as ""Dr.,"" the title is usually reserved for actual medical doctors. Otherwise, credentials become shades of gray with great potential for misrepresentation. In this film, most participants addressed as ""Dr."" are neither physicians nor Ph. D.s, and evidently earned the title in some other universe. Since the overwhelming majority have no genuine credentials whatsoever, a bunch of indecipherable and somewhat scary letters follow their names:  ""Visionary, I.M.A.,CH.,aR.,La.,TAN.""

Also questionable are the quotes from the famously successful that suggest, sort of, validation of these ideas, but not so much when yanked out of context.

Most distasteful of all, from beginning to end the ""secret"" is applied as a conduit to materialistic fame and fortune.  FEEL the steering wheel of that new sports car, and the universe will find a way for you to have it.  Hang a picture of that $5 million house on your ""visionary wall,"" and lo and behold you will find yourself living in that house. The most absurd example I can offer here is the assertion that those of us who get bills in the mail are ""attracting"" bills because we are thinking ""debt"", instead of ""wealth.""  Think ""wealth,"" and checks will come in the mail instead.  Evidently credit card companies have much stronger powers of manifestation.

1611751,4,B00005JPJ8,"I'm always searching and seeking for things that I do not understand in hopes of finding something that forwards me and helps me along in this strange existence we call life.  And whereas, every step I took to get here...other books, movies, seminars, etc...I felt that this began to sum up perfectly what I had encountered and began to know many times through out my life...that my life is exactly what I make it.  That I can only control how I feel and interpret and project in the world the way I want my life to be.  And I can only empathize with people who choose to be victims of their life.  I can't make them change and being sad about it doesn't help.  I can only live out my passion and being happy is completely up to me.  Everyday I wake up and I am grateful for my partner.  I am grateful that at a young age and without a degree I am able to more than thrive and live in DC on my own.  I don't have two jobs.  I don't have sugar daddies or side jobs.  I made it on my own.  Why?  It's because it NEVER occurred to me to NOT expect to be able to do that.  I just expected it and I had it.  Yes, as they say the Universe unfolded it for me and I stepped into it.  I never expected anything less.  I see interns (I live in DC) or people that just got out of college struggle and have to have roommates and it puzzled me.  And I realized when they came here..they just expected life to be like that in DC.

Some people have a problem with the phrase the ""power of positive thinking"" in general.  Realists can list and rattle off a bazillion reasons why this movie is a crock.  Positive thinking is just a term and it can rub you the wrong way or not.  When people think of positive thinking they associate it with a bunch of yuppie suckers with nothing better to do in their life but buy into cult like garbage.  Not true.  I am a Native American woman who grew up on the rez and by all accounts should have never amounted to anything more than the walls of my reservation.  Through this type of work and not necessarily just The Secret I have been able to get where I am now.  I have a great job working for my people with a comfortable salary.  I've been able to create going to Paris for free.  I've created a awesome relationship with my partner who wakes me up with kisses everyday.  And by sharing this with my family...we're closer than I ever thought possible.  And its through this work that I know I'll achieve my goal of helping my people and the younger generation want more and see there is more out there.  I'm creating that abundance now so they can harness it for themselves.  Its happening.  These are my results...watching this dvd or reading the book is just another step I took and the results just grow and grow and grow.

If you're open to wanting more than the box you think you have to live into...then check it out.  And keep searching.  Keep wanting more and being grateful for what you do have.  It works.  And for everyone else...if your life works for you and the success you've gained without it is enough for you then it is.  Keep doing that and be happy.  I'm not here to tell you you'll never be happy if you don't see this movie.  I'm just saying...your life could change dynamically than if you never gave this movie a it try.  It's worth a shot...and you don't have to buy it.  Someone suggested get it a library or borrow it from a friend...rent it or watch it online for 4.95 on your computer.  There is NOTHING WRONG with not buying this movie to experience it.  And there is nothing wrong if you do.

Bottom line...if you're open to having something be better and more spectacular out there for you then watch it.  If you're a ""realist"" and happy with your life and are happy with the limits you put on it, I wish you enough success and happiness to sustain you beyond what you thought possible.

The basics of the concept are explained simply and powerfully in this video. It is much better produced than I expected. Even some of the campier images (e.g., the Genie) are very well done. So far, I have only viewed the DVD once, but I intend to review it regularly to solidify the concepts in my unconscious mind.

While it may not entirely be a secret, I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in further self discovery and understanding how the material world is created. Overall it's very interesting, thought provoking and well delivered.

Having studied metaphysics for over 40 years, I find this DVD powerful, informative with easy to use suggestions. It is not to wonder the how or the why, but to use the power of attraction (magnetic vibrational resonance) to bring positive healthy reactions and responses from the Universe.

We use the power of attraction every day in our lives. When we concentrate or think about what we don't want, or a person we don't like, or a disease, we are using the power of attraction.

There are people who have difficulty accepting they create their own world, positive or negative. We create our world and how we respond to the world (universe)! We can re-act (acting the same way over and over) or we can chose to be come conscious co-creators of our own existance by creating new trains of causation.",1176336000,6,822,4.774647887323944

Its pretty much common sense. ""Do unto others..."" comes to mind from the Bible. Think positive, give out positive vibes and see what happens. Smile at someone and pretty much they'll smile back. I always say, take something negative and turn it into something positive. If the world watched this movie maybe we could all get along and live in peace once and for all. All of the brilliant minds of the past have known about the secret and most of them haven't even seen the movie.

Many pages in the book brought home to me that some of the things I had done in my life previously,totally ignorant of The Secret,  were in actual fact creating the the things and situations that I required at the time.

Since reading the book I have experimented on several occassions with small desires and to my surprise every one has materialised.  Not always in the way that I had expected but every single one came to pass.  Now I'm on to bigger things and fully expect to achieve my wishes.

I'm thankful that I have read the book and seen the movie.  I'm of mature age now and realise how I come to be exactly at this position in my life. Which isn't too bad!  I now have the power to do and achieve a lot more things before I meet my maker.

Every person in the world is different and what resinates with one mind may not with the next.  I applaud the cast of The Secret, they have all shared some of their greatest habbits with the rest of the world.

1) Thought is the first most important process in The Secret. You becomes what you think about most, and attract what you think.

2) Focusing on the positive. Focus on what you want and focus on it positively. Positive thought is 100 times more powerful than the negative thought.

3) Some times what we wanted and focus on are delayed. This is called time-delayed. The secret film said that time-delay is good. As it give you time to re-think and re-calibrate, re-choose and reaffirmed your path and choice.. Very Positive.

4) After having the right thought, comes feeling. Good feeling creates and draw more good feelings. Therefore, feeling good is as important as thinking good. Your thoughts and your feelings create your future.

5) `Your Wish is My Command'. If you keep having negative feelings and `wishes' in your thoughts, the universe will say ""your wish is my command"" and you get want your think and feel about. But if you think, ask and believe that you will get what you think about, the universe will response ""your wish is my command"". Change your current circumstances by changing your thinking first.

6) Showing gratitude is very important. We must have attitude of gratitude. Start shifting your thinking by having good gratitudes.

7) ASK, BELIEVE and RECEIVE: Ask for what you want. Believe that it is already yours. Receive it.

Every celebrity will no doubt tell you that your actions and the good will of others will do more to heal individuals in need rather than implicitly blaming the poor for their mindset.",1176076800,8,724,4.975206611570248
1611933,1,B00005JPJ8,"It seems everyone knows this ""Secret"" is not a secret. So the DVD and book lie from the outset. It was never suppressed. There is no proof offered that the famous people who knew the ""secret"" actually knew it.

It's a repackaged version of the Book ""The Power of Positive Thinking. Positive thinking is a good way to feel happy and confident. It helps to accomplish your goals. This book says you don't have to work you only have to think in the correct, positive way and then want you want will somehow arrive.

It says Isaac Newton knew the secret. And for those of you who aren't aware of the premise the secret is the ""Law of Attraction""

But Newton formulated something different,

The law of universal attraction

This was identified by Newton as a force acting upon any two bodies in the Universe, Called the law of universal attraction or gravity.

The law that an object will fall to the ground or the moon is held in place by a larger object; the Earth. It wasn't about getting necklaces.

Having people give you an expensive necklace is one of the things the DVD shows are attainable if you use their Law of Attraction.

Here's the central premise of the Secret so those of you out there don't have to spend money on this.

The law of attraction that is mentioned in the book and DVD is; if you have positive thoughts about wanting things or health or love then those things will come to you.

Ask, Believe, Receive are the key to getting what you want.

On one hand the DVD ""experts"" (since the creator of the movie found experts that is more proof there is no secret.) say that the law of attraction works whether you believe in it or not. But with Ask, Believe, Receive it states you have to BELIEVE for it to work. That is the way out for most spiritual con artists. If their predictions are wrong or their advice doesn't work it is your fault.

The DVD also warns that if you think negatively than those bad things will happen to you. One example in the movie is a person in their car who does not want to be late. He thinks I don't want to be late so that supposed negative thought radiates outside him and causes him to be stuck in traffic. I don't know about you but I have not wanted to be late many times and that was all that was on my mind.

I either left early and wasn't late or I drove really fast and I wasn't late and I was late. There was no correlation between thought and result.

The creator a Ms. Byrne a TV producer was not doing well financially or in her career when she read a book

''The Science of Getting Rich,'' first published in 1910. No suppression of that book. She then read other non suppressed books in the same theme.

So what did she do? Did she use the power of the secret to attract millions of dollars and attract wonderful TV projects to produce that would make her lots of money and fame? No she worked. She came up with and idea and wrote out a script, she sought out financing for the movie. She didn't wait until the financing was attracted to her. She sat down and wrote a book. She worked to get what she wanted.

Ms. Byrne upended the whole idea of the Law of Attraction by going out and getting something instead of ASKING, BELIEVING AND RECEIVING

Then by clever marketing, she was able to expose the DVD to the public and enough people who look for the easy way in life purchased it. They were not attracted to blindly send her money. She provided a place to buy it. The book preaches magic but the creator practiced hard work and persistence and good old fashioned imagination to get her millions. The fact that her ideas are not worth buying but sold into the millions is a testament to those many people who don't want to work or develop their imagination. They want the get rich quick scheme. Or get love quick or get healthy quick scheme.

Bottom line: The Secret is of no value as it can be summed up in a few phrases that have been openly spoken and written for ages.

Think Positive about your life, Think about what you want to achieve. Visualize your goal or whatever accomplishment large or small you want to attain. Much like a Golfer sees his shot landing on the green before he hits the ball. Study, work and show initiative in order to gain that which you want. If you sit in your home waiting, nothing will happen. Of course you should also buy a lottery ticket now and then because somebody has to win.

One last story about negative thinking, I wrote and performed in a play, at a small Toronto theatre. I financed it myself. I made the costumes and props and did most of the Publicity. We rehearsed and had some previews and then it was time for the night the critics came.

For two weeks I was convinced the critics would hate it. I was able to visualize their faces in the audience looking grim, bored and angry they had showed up.

It was irrational but those thoughts obsessed me. That Opening night was also the night the heat didn't work and it was 12 degrees outside

The reviews came out the next week and it was a huge critical success. They all loved it! The play sold out for 8 months. So despite what the secret says, despite the law of attraction that works whether you believe it or not, I didn't attract bad reviews. I had worked very hard and despite my negativity and fear the play was a success.",1176076800,15,5296,4.315524193548387

I'm a big fan of motivational speakers and self-improvement teachings and have completely adopted a ""Constant and Never Ending Improvement"" approach to life. So, when I hear someone say such powerful things about some form of teaching, I'm immediately interested. This ridiculous pile of garbage is nothing more than a doctors amazing knowledge of marketing techniques and new spins on old ideas. This ""movie"" takes old school neuro-linguistic programming and makes the watcher/reader focus on the smallest most insignificant area of themselves. I'd be surprised if half of the watchers/readers of this horrible excuse for a money making scheme actually pull anything from it. Pass on this garbage and invest in some running shoes.",1175990400,53,866,5.148936170212766
1611948,4,B00005JPJ8,"I borrowed this movie from a friend and watched it two times in a row.

I practiced some of the techniques, such as focusing on the positive aspects of others, including my spouse and coworkers.  I immediately noticed changes.  There were several days that I was so ""ill"" I could not focus on the positive, while at work, and the changes reflected in my coworkers' attitudes as well.  One particular day, however, I began my day in a sour mood, felt grumpy towards coworkers, but decided to change my day and make it a positive one.  Immediately, I noticed a turnaround in THEIR attitudes as well, and we all had a great day.

With my spouse, the result was amazing, as well.  Just MY practicing the techniques made a huge difference.  It truly was ""catching"".

The next thing I did was practice, every moment that I could (mainly while driving), on all that I saw around me that I was grateful for.  I'm currently trying to master the art of being grateful for my existence, which is a little trickier.  But the simple art of REALLY LOOKING around and thinking about what I have to be grateful for is eye opening, and somehow, diminishes the problems in your life.  You quickly realize all that you really DO have, and understand that you can overcome the bad.  Did it help change what might have started out a crummy day to a better one?  Of course.  I could have focused on the negatives, the problems, things I cannot change that upset me, and most of all, the fact that I had to work instead of enjoying the 80 degree weather outside.  But by focusing on the positives that I DO have, it somehow made it easier.  Any time I found myself thinking negatively or dwelling on the bad, I switched to what I DO have, and yes....it made a difference.

They taught the idea of ""living"" the ultimate, end result that you desire.  I did this, too, and still do.  It hasn't happened yet, but I hope it will.  What it DID do for me was this.

On my drive to work, I focused on that fantasy.  Considering that I have massive panic attacks every single morning on my drive to work, the result that came from focusing on something I desire so was that I haven't had a single panic attack.  It's been all good.  How can you complain about that?  Even if it never materialized, good came from it.  I never saw the harm in fantasizing about what you would like from life, anyway. What IS the harm?

I also found myself gearing more toward ""what I can do"" to achieve that goal, instead of mere depression that it seems hopeless.  I liked the line in the movie that ""if someone has done it, you can do it"".  Why not?

There isn't a thing wrong with hope.  Give me a hopeful person any day over a sullen, depressing, negative one.  If this movie gives someone hope, how can that be wrong?  Is hopeLESS right?

Here's an example for you.  We've always wanted to move to the beach.  I feel pretty ""hopeful"" that somehow, we'll achieve this one day.  This past week, I practiced my new ""techniques"" from this movie and other internet material on the subject.  While at work, a relative called, and I commented about ""when we move to the beach one day"".  This person guffawed and said ""yea, right.  You have to be realistic and take care of things in your life, not dream about things like that"", or something to that effect.

I felt my whole dream go down in smoke. From the mere words of a cynic.  It took the rest of the day to boost myself back up.

See, as in ""what's wrong with hope""?

The example they give in the movie using ""stubbing the toe"", with the point being ""move on - get past it"".  What's wrong with that?

They teach giving to yourself, and loving yourself.  Is this worse than low self esteem?  Does anyone condone low self esteem?  Who has that helped?  And yes, if you love yourself, you can easily love others.  If you DON'T love yourself, how CAN you love others?

Focusing on what you appreciate in others..how is that bad?  It's a WONDERFUL concept!  Trying to reinforce those good qualities that you do appreciate.  Is that so horrible?

Being positive when faced with illness...How could that be bad?  Isn't it common knowledge that attitude is extremely helpful in cancer patients?

Protecting your goal from negativity...pushing out the negative thoughts.  Doesn't that go along with low self esteem?  Believe in yourself and your dream?  Nothing ever stopped a person in their tracks faster than a non-belief in his or herself or what they were striving for.

Would YOU tell a child who wanted to be a champion gymnast that they were never going to make it?

There was so much more in this movie that inspired me.  Although it's presented in an exaggerated way, the principles are all good.  All good.  Anyone believing they can receive joy from being hopeless, dreamless, seeing the world in black and white with no colors to brighten that world, then this would not be the movie for you.

I myself have ordered my own copy today.  The two weeks I've practiced these methods have been quite an improvement over the previous two weeks, and I personally enjoy a little hope in my life.",1175990400,18,5095,4.470076169749728
1611949,4,B00005JPJ8,"This was actually surprisingly inspirational to my wife and I.  Neither of us  tend to fall for the spiritual and religious stuff all that easily.  But this movie captured both of us.  We found ourselves nodding the entire time through the movie because of all the common links it would bring up that we too had already seen in life.

As inspirational as this movie is though, it offers little in the way of explanation of the theory behind it.  the movie projects the theory just as simply as it can be.  but honestly the whole concept is a bit more complex than it lets on.  it seems as though this movie was more of an inspirational extension to 'What the Bleep Do We Know' than anything else.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-Bleep-Do-We-Know-Discovering-the-Endless-Possibilities-for-Altering-Your-Everyday-Reality/dp/0757305628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the Bleep Do We Know!?: Discovering the Endless Possibilities for Altering Your Everyday Reality</a>

1611950,1,B00005JPJ8,"I have been hearing about this movie for a few months now, but had a feeling it would not really be the type of material I enjoy and appreciate.

I finally got curious enough and looked for it at my video club. They didn't have it. So I looked online, at my video club's site. They didn't have it there either. So I came to Amazon.com, where I had seen this as one of their recommendations, based on the type of material I usually buy. Before buying the movie, I read the reviews, which is something I really got into the habit of doing and feel very grateful to Amazon for offering this feature.

As I read through the reviews, I realized I had been right all along. It's just a scheme to get money, and not worthy of my time or money. This is a shame.

Being someone very curious and interested in spirituality and psychology for many years now, I have had my share of books that go down this road (I even own a book by Esther Hicks). But at a certain point, I got tired of reading crappy material and decided to only go for things written with at least some scientific background, and from reliable, serious authors.

I believe there is a fantastic universe out there that we have barely started to notice and learn about. We should be motivated and stimulated to study further and learn more. But, unfortunately, our capitalist and predatory mentality makes us just try to make a buck out of it. It is, indeed, a shame.

As an earlier reviewer pointed out, it is offensive that the video claims that everyone can live lavishly and in complete disregard for our environment and planet. We are a very destructive race that needs to realize we are not gods and our acts will come with consequences. This is why I try to read and learn, and also keep my heart and mind open, as well as try do my part on what I believe is truly important. We should be worried about environmental issues, we should also be working on birth control throughout the planet. There is no room for all these people to live comfortably. Yes, you can fit a whole lot more humans on this planet, physically speaking. But we will kill ourselves, all other races, and even the planet if we keep going at this rate. If you have ever learned about maintaining fish tanks, you know what I mean. You see a big tank and think it can hold 100+ fish because it's big. In reality, if you have more than 30 or so, they will start to get sick and die because they need a balanced environment in order to survive, not just physical space.

Catholicism has done the planet no favor with their ""birth control is a sin"" mentality. This may have been useful a couple of thousand years ago, when there weren't 6+ billion people on the planet, but things have changed.

I truly hope we, as a race, can pull through this by raising our level of awareness and changing the way we live. I think learning to be respectful would be a great start. Respecting other races, the environment, and even the food we eat, would be a really great start. And I notice some thought movement in that direction, I notice people are much more open to information about this, and learn about what needs to change in order for things to work. Then videos like this, or books with material like this come out, and all I think is about how many well intentioned people read or watch the material and decide this is all crap and just forget about trying to change.

As I said, it's a shame...  :(

UPDATE:
A lot of people said I can't judge a movie without seeing it. It makes sense...

So I broke down and rented it OnDemand (by the way, have I mentioned I hate Comcast? - just like to say this whenever I have a chance). Yes, it says a lot of things I believe in, nothing new. My problem with the movie is still the same: it uses good concepts in commercial material trying to make a buck. I don't like that. Therefore, I still don't like the movie. It turned out to be pretty much what I thought. I'm just glad it played OnDemand (even though I hate Comcast - oh, wait...

I read a book by Scott Adams many years back, the one who writes the Dilbert comics, and at the back of one of his books (I think it's The Dilbert Principle), he has this thing called ""Affirmation"", where everyday, you write 15 sentences of something you want to happen. I picked what I thought at the time was the most impossible thing to happen to me - for me to get into the #1 graduate school in the United States on mediocre grades. Hey, guess what? I got in!

After watching this DVD, I went to look at the other things I've written. I think I wrote a total of 6 things, 4 of them came true - and all of these were similarly difficult to come by. For some reason I stopped doing that, mainly because I think it was a pain to write this all down, but this DVD seems to be pitching a similar idea.

I saw this after Amazon linked me to it through ""What the bleep do we know?"" And they're kinda similar ideas, even have two of the same speakers. The basic idea is to ask you to think about what you want, visualize it, believe that you have it, feel grateful of what you have, and that's it. There, I saved you the money you might have had to spend on the DVD.

I agree with some of the critics of this video, which suggested that all the bad things that've happened are things you've invited through your mind. I'm not going to touch that or speculate how others who are dealing with unimaginable suffering could accept that. I can only speak for myself, and I can certainly see how it is that you can fall into a cycle of despair and self-pity, and also how good and bad things seem to come in waves. That's not proving this radical theory of theirs, but it's something to consider.

One other thing that bothered me was their tendency to focus on material wealth. Now, they do talk about love and health, but they had money first, and I think they could've put that last, but I guess they figured that's one of the things that really get people down. For the cynic, you might also think that this is how they want to get money out of your pockets.

Interestingly, as part of the extra feature, the main guy (Bob Proctor I think) talks about these seminars and that on their website, you can buy stuff. Let me say this upfront: DO NOT SPEND A PENNY ON ANY OF THIS. It's not about whether you believe it or not, it's that even if they're 100% right, and especially if they're 100% right, then you don't need to spend anything on this. Just think good thoughts, think of what you want, and those things will manifest. I didn't even spend money on this DVD. I got it off Netflix (I guess I technically did, but you know what I mean).

As a more positive note, in the main part of the movie, they don't talk about selling you stuff, so that helps a little. Also, the book that supposed inspired this (and for some reason they don't mention it by name in the movie), is called ""The Science of Getting Rich"", and is written in 1912, so the guy's long dead and you won't have to worry that he's trying to rip you off. (Of course, religion has been asking people for money for eons and created huge industries, and that's seldom been brought up as a source of skepticism).

So, if it's not already apparent to you, I'll just say: Be skeptical. Don't waste money on this or any other kind of self-help, BUT, if it doesn't hurt to try, if it doesn't cost you to try it, then try it. Try sending out good things and imagining something you want, and see what happens. The worst thing is that you don't get it, and you're not worse off than you began. That's the best way to ""test"" it.",1175731200,5,3624,4.198275862068965

1612067,5,B00005JPJ8,"Thank you for taking your precious time in reading my review.  I hope that my undestanding of The Secret helps you in deciding whether to attain it or not.

The reason as to why I am writing about The Secret is because I feel very passionate about it and I know that many people can benefit from the teachings if only they understand them better.

To me The Secret represents the way our universe works.  I once read that ""we are not a mind living in a body but instead a body living in a mind.""  According to my understanding of The Secret we create everything that occurs to us in our daily lives.  The universe works with the law of attraction which says that like attracks like.  In terms of the mental aspect we attract whatever it is that we are constatnly thinking about.  It's as if we are creators of our own reality.

For instance, if you think about positive things you will tend to attract positive things into your life.  However, if you think negatively all of the time, you will attract negative circumstances.  The problem lies in that we focus too much on the negative aspects of our lives and the result is to receive more of that which we don't want.  By changing the focus of our thoughts we can alter our present state.

I had heard of this law of attraction before from different people and books, but I had never really completely understood it.  After watching The Secret I understood that what I was missing was the fact that it is our feelings that provide the fuel for our thoughts to become a reality.  When we FEEL strongly about something we tend to attract it.

In essence, the best way to approach life is to never ever give an ounce of thinking to the things we don't want; and simply spend all of our time focusing on the things which we truly want in our lives.

I have personally applied the teachings of The Secret and my life is so much better.  It's as if I am living little miracles on a daily basis. Things like parking spaces, clothing items, finding a nice gym, meeting nice girls, and finding a job with nice people are now common in my life.  I used to complain about my car having mechanical problems and now I never ever think about them and the car works perfectly.  I know it's a bit hard to believe but try it and you'll see.

So far I have watched The Secret 14 times because every time I watch it I get something new out of it and it reminds me as well as it inspires me.

I truly wish that those of you who find The Secret difficult to understand because of the way it is presented etc., can look beyond those persons communicating The Secret and simply pay attention to their message.  Try to think about the principles themselves that you are being taught and avoid judging it.  Simply try to open yourself to these new ideas and try to apply them.  Until you apply them you will not Know whether they work or not.  Patience and ""an unwavering faith"" is required to acquire those things which you most desire.

I don't have all the answers to all of the problems that the world is experiencing.  However, I do know that The Secret has helped me live a better, more prosperous and healthier life.

I trust that many of you are intelligent, motivated and well meaning individuals that if you only knew and applied the message from The Secret not only will you be able to help yourself but you can help many others as well live a happier life.

If I had to buy The Secret again I would not think twice and pay for it because to me it was worth every penny.  Thank you for reading my message and may peace, health and happiness be with you always.",1175644800,7,3598,4.309523809523809
1612068,5,B00005JPJ8,"I am so glad that someone has finally pulled the Law of Attraction into the media.  The media always seems to focus on the bad things that happen in our world.  As we know, what we focus on expands.

I believe that our childhood obesity epidemic is a direct result of many parents fearing that their neighborhood is unsafe because of what we hear about in the news.  We keep our children in the house, where they typically sit in front of a screen, eating less-than-healthy snacks, gaining weight.  Screen time has been positively linked to obesity.

It is my hope that the media will begin to focus more on all of the good people and things that are happening around us.  Thank you Oprah for helping to share this message.

As I read the other reviews I can see how some of these concepts have really push on other people's filter systems.

If you are serious about changing your life watch this movie and use it to clear out all of your limiting emotional responses to feeling like a victim or believing anyone has ever been one. Life is such a gift, all of it - even the events we see as tragic.

You are a magical being and the universe only has one answer to all of our request - YES. Of course we have to take the actions because just wishing ain't going to make it so. When I was first studying the nature of reality I said that these new age concepts felt like brain washing and one of the other students looked at me and said your brain need washing.

This is a great movie to help wash your mind of all that limiting stuff. I like the presentation in What the Bleep better but the message is here.

Early in my spiritual explorations a friend once said - ""You know either God is or God isn't. This is either friendly universe or a hostile one and your experience of life is dependent on how you answer those questions for yourself.""

This movie will show you how the universe works. And any emotional reaction you have to the concepts has nothing to do with the movie or the concepts and everything to do with your personal belief structure that is limiting your experience of this magical universe.

With love and aloha,

Susan

The encouragement for all to think big and out of the box is illustrated though sounds, visual images, colors,and symbolism that reaches all on a subliminal level.  For this reason,I recommend this DVD to everyone. In it,the ideas rapidly unfold. The message is given on both the visual and subliminal levels. Subtitles are used to imprint the subconscious while the viewer hears messages of encouragement, looks at Di Vinci-like drawings, beautiful photographs and listens to testimonials from professionals who are using "" The Secret"". Some humor is injected into the narrative and repetition is used. This appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds. I even recommend it for teenagers. As my daughter watched this, she used some of the concepts to change some of the dynamics and challenges that she faces,as well.

The universal ideas are presented in a understandable and gentle manner. An example of this is to "" use gratitude each day to change our mood"". This, in turn translates into self-motivation. Add the overwhelming message to believe that you may have anything you want and soon you will aim for the goals you have been putting off. There are many books and tapes that have similar and overlapping ideas, but this one unfolds it into a whole package. It includes a melange of ways on  how to change your thoughts, improve relationships, use visualization and realize your highest goals and give others the space to do the same.

This DVD opens up your mind while explaining the direct way to channel your thoughts into positive action. You can create a better self-image, relationships and change your moods by watching this DVD along with the book and sharing with close friends and family. I would certainly love to see groups of people form to share about their ideas,process and outcomes based on this DVD. That is how successful this DVD will be, in my opinion.

The DVD also is a great business motivational tool. These same ideas have been applied in leadership forums and have helped me to visualize change within the department that I lead. This DVD has allowed the channels of thought to speedily transfer into clear goals and great ideas that come to me without stress or strain, to present the ideas clearly and improve my communication with supervisors and employees. Another aspect is that this brings employees together to discuss the team goals, the goals and obstacles of individuals and to give strength and thought to ""what next in a company"". As an Assistant Principal I have already applied many of these ideas to reprogram my own thoughts and to open up lines of communication with teachers, parents and students. Having read many leadership books and watched DVD's specific to the field, this cuts along all lines of business.

Hey, I have a great idea for all those looking for meaning in their seemingly pointless and aimless lives.... yes thats right, the ""No one needs a purpose in life!, all you need is cash oh, and all the other garbage that makes life soooo much fun whilst waiting for death"".

Why let reality spoil your deluded life, just wish it all away.

A massive screening of this ""SEcret"" should be shown to all those starving families in Africa, they must be made to realise that they are actually to blame and must change their thinking as it sure would be easier to our collective (UN)conscience and hip pocket if they just wish all of their own suffering away.

I mean, to think that all we had to do all these centuries was to just think it all better!???

So reality is actually a form of mental illness all along, who would of thunk it?

Yes there are ""universal truths""

Including,

 1. Yes, we can effect change in our lives and those around us by positive thinking.

 2. Dogs make the best people.

 3. You get what you give.

 4. When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, sorry, that's probably Skizophrenia!

 5. The grass is always greener on the other side, unless you have to mow it.

 6. In this world there are 2 types of people, those who want to believe that they can find their riches without really trying and those who make their riches selling that fantasy to them.

In conclusion, I say if you want to believe the ""Secret"" and if it makes you happy, its money well spent.

And, If you do get all you dreamed of, perhaps you may then get bored of all your riches and think, what about those who don't have my wonderful life? And perhaps then you may feel compelled to help them, not only by spreading the ""secret"" like some expensive chain letter, but perhaps by actually getting up and giving your time and mega riches to help those less fortuneate?????

1612149,2,B00005JPJ8,"Would such a precious secret really be revealed for $35?

Why would something so IMPORTANT just be handed out to everyone.

...You know the answer to that.

I have been exposed to many ""new age"" and ""spiritual"" views. I have been a seeker of truth all of my life. My friends showed me The Secret one evening and it seemed very important for them to show it to me. I can see why they did. At first, even past much of the cheesiness, I loved it. I even bought it. Then after a few days reality hit me. Something was not right about it. They were leaving important things out, like accountability. The whole focus is on creating whatever you want for your own selfish fulfillment. Well how about the fact of what you want affecting others? The approach is so narcissistic. I don't remember much talk of helping others at all in The Secret. The whole video is about Self fulfillment. I'm sorry but there is already TOO MUCH of that going on the world. Especially here in the good ol' United States. Our addiction to things and money is ruining us.. isn't it obvious?

It is a wonderful dream to think that you can CREATE your own reality the way you want it. It is a wonderful fairy tale land that you could get lost in. It is not happiness though. It is not what anyone REALLY wants. It just can seem like it is.

They talk about being tired of getting bills in the mail. You should start visualizing money instead of bills. And the money WILL come.

Say what?! If you have bills, you brought them into your life by creating that debt. You can ""expect"" to get money in your mailbox all you want. What about your own accountability of the bills you have. The video talks about bills like they are just a result of your ""scarcity"" thinking. No accountability. Strictly self fulfillment.

This video shows quotes from great people of history, such as Einstein, Martin Luther King, and Mother Teresa. I wish they were alive today to speak about the selfish views of this video.

There are bits of truth in this video, don't get me wrong, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular.

I was amazed at how often some of the principles in it discussed were operative in my own life and I didn't even know. I think that all sorts of terminology can be used to describe what the secret really is, but for me it fits perfectly within my faith in God and trust that He will bless us according to our will and desires. It was liberating to feel what power lies in our hands to control the outcome of what happens in our lives, but I think it's important to realize that if anything happens, it happens because of God and He is ultimately the one in control.",1175472000,2,656,4.214285714285714

1612220,1,B00005JPJ8,"The assertions of this work and others of this ilk cannot be disproved. It is impossible to provide proof that you don't create your own reality. Supposedly, if you think the correct thoughts, you will create desired outcomes. If you do not have your desired outcomes, it is your own fault, because you obviously haven't thought the correct thoughts. If these ideas could be disproved, then if people did not manifest whatever they thought, we could conclude that the idea that they create their own reality is incorrect.

But no. The idea that you create your own reality can never be proved incorrect for many reasons. If people thought the correct thoughts but didn't get what they wanted, they either didn't really think correctly, didn't think the thoughts for long enough, or don't believe they genuinely deserve whatever they want to manifest. Notice how it is utterly impossible to prove the idea of creating your own reality wrong. That is, no evidence can ever be interpreted in a way that suggests that you do not create your own reality. If an idea can't be proved wrong, well, it can be proved right, either.

At first, the notion that you create your own reality seems rather harmless. Actually, it has the potential to create considerable distress.

The genuine tragedy behind this set of ideas is that it makes people who are truly suffering blame themselves. Those who are poor, abused, handicapped, etc. are led to believe that they have brought these conditions on themselves. Perhaps those who origninated these ideas thought that they might motivate folks who are poor or handicapped or abused. In fact, those who are already suffering often feel worse because they think they have brought their conditions on themselves.

There is an extra layer of damage that arises from the notion that you create your own reality. Changing thoughts actually does have a meaningful impact on mood and behavior. (This is probably what Epictetus and others meant by the power of thoughts.) Therapies that have proven effective often rely on challenging maladaptive thoughts so people can feel better and build meaningful lives.

Unfortunately, people who have endured the kind of unfalsifiable reasoning put forward in works like this one are apprehensive about using the effective therapies. The effective therapies seem reminiscent of the notion that you create your own reality, an idea that made them miserable in the past.

So this work is not only untrue, it is potentially damaging.",1175385600,99,2495,5.0290556900726395

I have always said if you think it you can do it and I am a living example of this law before I even new the ""attraction or intention"" definition for this ability...and the beautiful thing is you are only limited by your own connection to the universe.

1612235,5,B00005JPJ8,"For along time I have felt the pull to become a great teacher of enlightenment with my dreams telling me where to find the great teachings that I should be teaching.  This Secret narrows a lot of it down to one place. One book instead of my entire library full. And, It's corresponding movie is done in an extraordinary way that explains it all in a simple fashion like a mother teaching a child.

Since this book has came out and now the movie, I have bought about 20 copies and given them away as gifts to all my friends. They have pushed for me to open an enlightenment academy to teach about the Secret and other great works like the movie ""What the Bleep, do we know"".

Unfortunately, Owning two business's and remodeling houses to sell still does not provide enough income to pay managers to run my Nightclub and Restaurant while I pull back to start teaching about simple subjects like the Secret or Bleep. Although, these two books have opened my eyes and greatly doubled my income, I will need a larger financial backing for the center I should build.

 My recent success has all come about just by being introduced to a new way of asking for what you want. The powers that be, God, or what ever you personally want to call ""it"" will give you what you ask for, eventually, If and only if, you ask in the right way and you believe. This fundamental truth is a large part of what the Secret is.

Asking in the right way, is what this book and its corresponding dvd will teach you. It's what the Secret is all about. I recommend it for every one, I also recommend it for required reading or watching in every High School in the World. Could you possibly imagine an evolutionary jump in enlightenment on a worldly scale? The possibilities would be limitless!

I will soon be writing another review letting you know how my own personal request for financial backing came about, when it happens. Believe me when I say, it will happen. This ""Secret"" has given me the strength and courage to ask for the tools I need to make a big difference in this close minded world of the Bible Belt called Alabama.

Oh, by the way, if my review has helped you to actually decide if you want to at least give it a try, please say a wish for me to help me achieve my goals in helping others and know that I truly wish for you to reach yours.

Please tell Mrs. Rhonda Byrne and all others that may have helped make this book and DVD a reality, Thank You.

While I'm all for the power of positive thinking and believe it can be helpful, it is completely irresponsible to imply that that is all one might need medically.

There really is no secret and after watching this expensive DVD, I felt taken for a ride. All they are really saying is that the universe gives you what you spend the most time thinking about and it doesn't know the difference between something that might be negative and something that is positive. So, if you spend a lot of time dwelling on and thinking about the negative things that you fear, that is what you will get in life. If on the ther hand you spend a lot of time concentrating on the positive, that is what the universe will give you because you would have spent more time focusing on the positive (ie. it's all just about the power of suggestion).

It is the most effective technique I've encountered.  Hats off to the people who came up with this marketing strategy.  They'll make millions.  Watch for the sequels - there will be several.  There are many more effective, inexpensive ways to learn these techniques.  You don't need to go spending thousands to do it.

The ideas presented in ""The Secret"" are not new. There is no claim that they are. In fact, from the outset it is stated that these philosophies are ancient.

Some may try to pass this off as simply a ""New Age"" revision and blending of Napoleon Hill's, Dale Carnagie, and Hindu philosophies. To some extent this is true, but there is something to be said for getting an old idea stated in a new way.

There is not much new here and it hasn't been secret.  That's hype. You can find many of the concepts here from the Bible.  Jesus tells us to do these things in the Gospels. My very Christian mother has used these techniques for over 20 years through her church and reading the Bible.

Most of this information was also in the movie ""What the Bleep do we Know--Down the Rabbit Hole"".  A movie that I dearly love and is probably overall a better film. In ""Bleep"" the science is explained as to how this all works through quantum physics. I enjoyed the science lesson.

""The Secret"" is an easier dose to get down if one doesn't want to be bothered with quantum physics. ""The Secret"" doesn't spend much time on explaining how it works scientifically but it IS very inspirational. People must know though that they need to have faith, patience, and perseverance in order for it to work.  It is not a magic wand.

I wonder if the doubters who watch this film ever considered opening their minds to the teaching of this message and applying these techiques to their lives.  It certainly won't work if you stubbornly refuse to apply this information to your life.

There are people who watch these movies that seem to be addicted to their current life style. Apparently they don't want to make even the smallest effort to change their thoughts. Certainly most doctors would reccommend positive thinking. It's got to reduce stress if nothing else!

I've known of ""The Law of Attraction"" since the 1970s and have proven its value in my own life. I started living according to The Secret when I was earning only $525 a month as a government clerk. When I had no ""connections"" or credentials and no money either. Today my world is what I had dreamed it could be. Many of the people I used to work with are still struggling and their attitudes are still what they were in the 1970s. I changed my attitude before I had changed my circumstances and all the things I wanted to achieve somehow became accessible to me as I continued to optimistically work toward my goals. This will work for you too, but you have to be willing to be wrong, to not be ""cool"" for the moment and to accept a new way of thinking about your life.

If you haven't conscientiously lived this way for an extended period then no wonder you don't believe in it. Accurately saying that this doesn't work requires experience not just observation. It would be like criticizing exercise because you tried it for one week and it didn't work for you. Or saying that you listened to an entire recorded program on Spanish but still can't speak it fluently. Of course you can't, you haven't practiced it consistently over a period of months.

Yet, there are many folks who feel the need to discard and deny this message. You can see in some of the ""reviews"" how unhappy and cynical people have disparaged and devalued The Secret as if it were claiming to be a ""pay me first and I'll show you the only  true way to happiness"" message. That is NOT the case. This message has been offered for free on Oprah, Larry King Live and in interviews in all media around the globe. You don't have to pay to get this insight. Just watch for the places in your area that are showing it or borrow it from a friend, or go and read it in the library or a bookstore.
People have claimed that this is some scheme for the rich authors to get money from poor followers with the implication that the followers will remain poor. Hogwash! This is an uplifting message and experience that is based on practical truth. The authors have lived it and so have I.
Those who ""get it"" can do likewise. It's not unlike gravity. It is a natural law. This is how things work. Deny it at your peril. Gravity always works here on earth and so does The Secret.
I am proud of my colleagues for offering this message and I'm thrilled that the marketplace has responded with such enthusiasm. Millions are getting the message and their lives will be better for it.",1175212800,7,2768,4.40234375

They must have missed the part about your ""actions"" lining up with your thoughts. It's not just wishful thinking, it's being more aware of how you can sabotage yourself with negative thinking, and how you can become more powerful by monitoring your internal dialogue. Like any philosphy, you can take what works for you, and leave the rest.",1175212800,4,698,4.729508196721311

Of course if a child wishes for something grandpa would know about it and eventually buy the child his bike. It was a bit too much and a tad hokey.

I try to live my life in a positive light and the secret is something that I have tried to practice over the years. The concept to me is real and understandable. As for the DVD I would say most women know about this 6th sense and it is a lucky man who is also able to tap into this force.

I am not going to claim that I understand or don't understand the secret.  I am going to ask: WTF?

Some of the reviewers appear to consider ""The Secret"" to be the greatest phrase, aphorism, etc. ever uttered, and then there is a minority of reviewers who consider it utter drivel.  The diametric oppostion leads me to believe that ""the secret"" is some pseudo-religious thingee.  Usually pseudo-religion thingees can be more accurately classified as something in the flavor of a cult.  I am not saying that ""The Secret"" is something cultish or that there is any malicious intent behind this book, DVD, Audio book, etc., but it is interesting that people would feel so strongly (Read: emotionally based, not rational) about ""The Secret"".

In many ways & I'm so thankful that I've gotten into it.

If you don't 'get it' the first time, try looking at it again with an open mind.

The Secret may be a little heavy with financial gain, but it's the one thing that most people will pay attention to, and if the Secret works in their financial life then they will start using it in other aspects of their lives.

Within days, I got up off my lazy and wrote a book called ""The Ancient Secret Code: The Law of Attracting Bleep Loads of Cash, Goodies, Pleasure, Love, Power, Prizes, Riches and Wealth."" The irony is that this was all made possible by the secret.

Thank you Oprah. Thank you Rhonda. Thank you Bob. Thank you Jack. Thank you internet gurus. Thank you bodybuilders. Thank you genie. Thank you Leonardo. Thank you ancient Babylonians. Thank you guy that touched the statue and it magnetized into gold. That was VERY AWSOME! I'd like to know  how to do that. Oh, my gosh, I forgot...THE SECRET! Yes, now I can magnetize gold out of the belly of the whale! SWEET!

I am no longer ugly and poor. I am rich with the infinity of King Solomon's ancient treasure and I am EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL. Actually, this changes very rapidly based on the +/- quantum measurement of my thought waves. It's very inconvenient actually.

THE GOOD: The good news is that the positive thinking/feeling idea to keep yourself in a better mindset to work toward your goals. One of the positive messages is being responsible for your feelings and thoughts and having gratitude for what you DO have.

THE BAD: The movie is candy coated and does not address REAL world/society issues. If I ask and visualize the war in Iraq to end... will the Universe respond to me: ""YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND"" and if it doesn't happen I didn't do THE SECRET correctly? They said I could have ANYTHING I wanted. Gosh darn-it!

THE UGLY: The Speakers do NOT talk about the consequences of Evil. And condone the idea people are creating everything they get as if they want to get raped, murdered and what about the people who are starving in the world...

Parts of the film that didn't do much for me, because in my opion the producers were using 'money' knowing their audiance is a material society, that if money was used to guarantee an audiance.  This is the only aspect of the film that didn't sit well with me.

The Secret, is the Law of Attraction, this is an interesting concept and one that merits learning and knowing about.  And if you get past the materialism you can enjoy it.  This is the kind of DVD that you will either find it life altering or you might not like it and take it as a marketing tool designed by very smart people to make money.  It really depends on you, but you won't know it, until you watch.  It is one of those movies that you really need to see for yourself to formulate your own opinion.  Is it worth the $$$ to purchase it? I did, and I will watch it again, as it contains more positive than negative. Is the money part of it over done? yes.

Like anything else, it has its positives and it has its negative.  Don't look at it from the negative point of view.  Did someone make this film to make money? maybe yes, but so what if you get something out of it that might be helpful to you or someone else.  If you are not sure, borrow it from the library and if you like it, or find that it is useful to you, then buy a copy.  In my opinion it contains more positives than shortcomings.  Cover your eyes to the shortcomings and take what is positive for you.  If you do that, then you have gained.  Read the reviews, but in the end, it really depends on you.  Take in the reviews as information for consideration, but make your own decision through your own knowledge and not through the knowledge of others.

You still have to work at it; be it money relationships or whatever goals you have set for yourself.  As far as an illness, you still need proper medical care.

Now for the positive, The Secret does a phenomenal job at pointing out how important a positive mental attitude is, as without it you are practically doomed for failure.

""The Secret"" says that if you want something really bad, you need to focus on it to ""magnetically attract"" it towards you - this could be success, wealth, fame, whatever.

Which sounds great. I mean, its no shock people want to believe this, and it does sort of tie in with a larger sense of Eastern Philosophy in general. But what the producers forgot is that ACTION is what creates RESULTS.

This DVD gives you the impression that if you're lying in your chair all day eating Doritos and not attending job interviews like a loser, but if you THINK that you will become a millionaire soon, then VOILA you become a millionaire.

If that were true, I should have had a pony at 12, been a recording superstar at 18, and conquered the world by the time I was 21.

1612492,3,B00005JPJ8,"Let's take a look at The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of ""The Secret"".

First ...

THE GOOD: If you think your life just happens to you, perhaps watching The Secret will open your thought to new possibilities. You might find some concepts that can and will improve your present experience, make you a better person to live with and help you to experience more of the good in others.

It won't spoil the video if I tell you that ""The Secret"" is ""The Law of Attraction"". The basic concept is that you will attract into your experience whatever you focus on. This is self-evident to most people, but The Secret explores this phenominon in depth and in an admittedly very entertaining way.

Any true seeker will find *some* useful idea in almost any book or presentation of this kind -- and sometimes where it is least expected. So, it is with ""The Secret"".

While most folks who watch The Secret will focus on the ""good"" things The Secret will help them to ""get"", what I found most helpful was the reverse.

A lot of unhappiness results from focusing on the negative, and the concept of withdrawing your attention from those negative things that you don't want more of in your experience is very well covered.

This does not mean that you ignore something you can help to improve. You simply put your energy into the positive opposite. For example, you would focus on promoting peace instead of protesting war. And, you refuse to ""feed"" those phenomena you do not wish to see strengthened by your attention to them.

This concept might seem abstract, wrong or even dangerous to some pragmatic thinkers, but I have seen tangible positive results in my experience by refusing to focus on negative phenomena. At the very least, we're all a lot nicer to be around when not allowing ourselves to be dragged into negative thoughts and conversation.

So, if you look for good in The Secret, you can find it.

THE BAD: This video is possibly one of the most misguided efforts I have ever beheld. Here is the potential to help people by showing them how they can improve their and others' lives through *awareness* -- observing and redirecting their attention, thinking and feelings -- and this opportunity is completely overshadowed and squandered by appealing in the strongest possible terms to gross materialism instead.

So, instead of awakening you, it strives to put you even more to sleep in materialism.

The Secret promises to show you how to get all of the money and ""stuff"" you could ever want. Anyone who thinks that money and ""stuff"" will make them happy, must not have any.

If one really understood The Secret, they would know that the need is to focus on spiritual awakening. If we do this with sincerity, the money and stuff take care of themselves. We'll have what we *need*. Deep inside, you instictively knew that already, didn't you?

OK, so overriding a lot of very useful ideas in The Secret is this theme that the Law of Attraction is the way to get all of the gratuituous ego enhancements a poor suffering self-esteem-starved soul would ever want. Why have the makers of this video done that?

THE UGLY: Yeah, it's ugly. Just for starters, Google ""Bob Proctor"" (perhaps the driving force behind the making of The Secret) and check out some of his web sites. He's got lots to sell you including yet another MLM scheme he's cooked up where you can get rich selling his $2000 briefcase full of ""secrets"" to your friends and neighbors.

The real shame of all this is that some of the people who appear in and contributed to The Secret seem to have been there for the right reasons. But, a little investigation into what is motivating others is very revealing indeed.

So, watch if you wish, but watch with your eyes wide open to what some of the participants are up to. They want something and they want it from *you*.

Now, do you really want to awaken spiritually and find more life and peace or do you just want more money and stuff? If you want the money and stuff, by all means watch The Secret because it will most certainly help you get it. But if what you want is to awaken spiritually, I can make some better suggestions:

""The Power of Now"" by Ekhart Tolle

""A New Earth"" by Ekhart Tolle

These two works understood can really change your life for the better. You might enjoy them more on audio CD than reading the books but either way, you'll find much more benefit here than The Secret.

And, if you really want hardcore spiritual growth, check out ""Science and Health"" by Mary Baker Eddy. You might have to read this book a few times before you fall in love with it. Just keep reading and eventually you'll be very happy that you did.

Hope this helps.",1174953600,165,4672,4.562200956937799

You see, first you have to come up with a logical idea, but something you have to not sacrifice for (like a fad diet asks you to).

Second: You make it a 'secret' - you whisper it so that everyone wants to be in on it !

Third: You throw in a bit of a conspiracy, other people out there don't want you to know what the SECRET is!

Fourth: You allow everyone from conservative to hippy moon-beam alike to exercise their inner bigot, since once YOU know the secret all those 'other' people DESERVE what they get, up to (and including) starvation, homelessness, rape and death... but that's OK since they are just 'those' people and I didn't like them anyway - those sad fools! It's all their fault they didn't believe the SECRET. Now I can just tell myself it's ALL THEIR OWN FAULT and I don't have to feel bad for not caring anymore!

The idea that one has control over their own destiny and personal power is an extremely important shift in thinking.  However, I was very disappointed in the materialistic, self-serving bent stressed by ""The Secret"".  It focused on individual material gain, with no mention of one's responsibility to improving the world.  I also found the racial dynamics of the film disturbing.  Far from being universal, ""The Secret"" specifically targets the white middle class audience.  ""The Secret"" also privileges white men, almost exclusively, with being the historical holders of 'the secret', while implying that others have suffered because they have never figured 'it' out, and don't know any better.  These undercurrents are too blatant to ignore.  So, if you do purchase this film, be aware of the implications.  Other materials, such as works by Louise Hay, and Gary Zukav, or books like ""Ask and it is Given"", certainly give the same message with a more balanced, compassionate approach.",1174867200,8,1054,5.263473053892215

1612526,1,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is an entertaining look at how the Law of Attraction plays in integral part in how human beings interact with the universe, specifically as it pertains to how thoughts, words and actions create the ability for people to ""attract"" and obtain their desires.

But is this a ""Secret""?  No, not really.  Obviously, the Law of Attraction as well as other, fundamental, natural laws are not taught to people in our private or public education systems.  Neither is this Law or many others taught to people through their involvement in social, cultural or religious activities.

But what is so lacking here isn't the fact that ""The Secret"" is so secret, but that it leaves the viewer convinced that this Law and its sole application will provide a significant advantage in a persons ability to attract and obtain what they want in life.  Simply applying the Law of Attraction, in and of itself, will not provide any significant or non-significant advantage.

Truly, it is the application of this Law as well as other Laws not mentioned in this DVD that will enable a person to fulfill their potential through the development of their ability to know themselves and make decisions that will help them attract and obtain the life they choose.

The best way to predict the future is to create it, and simply applying the Law of Attraction will not create anything.  One must learn, understand, believe, embrace and apply all of the laws of the universe equally well and frequently if they are to achieve the success that this DVD denotes.

I believe that the author and contributors have created a nice piece of entertainment.  So much is missing here for this to be a reliable source of data and information to help people live, truly live.",1174867200,12,1742,4.792642140468227

The church has known this message for ages, only the world would not want to admit that. Now we are talking ""The Universe will agree with us, line up with us, or we with the Universer"" instead of saying God.

I enjoyed some of it, glad that it reinforced a message I already knew and needed to just be reminded of it again. And it coming from a different perspective was somewhat refreshing. But it was also represented still in a the Geenie in the bottle style. Too much commercialized and too much on the money.

1612572,3,B00005JPJ8,"As I viewed The Secret, I thought it was light in content, but was so pleased to hear a positive message regarding taking responsibility for our lives that I commended the producers and participants for getting the message out.  However, I am constantly hearing from people who are now condemning themselves because they are not attracting what they want as easily as The Secret indicates they can.  ""After all,"" they say, ""if Oprah and Larry King feel it's worth interviewing the participants of The Secret, it must be right"" - and their lack of results must be reflecting that there is something wrong with them.

Therefore, at this time, I have to give The Secret a lower rating than I might have previously as I believe that it's purely philosophy without substance or direction to take right action, and yet another attempt to make a dollar at the expense of viewers.  While it's great to hear the positive message, I believe it is creating more pain and suffering than hope and results for people.  As a professional counselor, I have worked with many people who to help them improve their lives, and I can attest to the fact that there is no easy answer such as The Secret attempts to provide.

There are a series of steps to understanding ourselves - knowing our own values and beliefs - and identifying and overcoming the barriers that block us from getting the results that we want.  Some of the participants in The Secret have indicated that there is more to this process and that we should stay tuned for The Secret II so that its authors and contributors can make more money.  Rather than holding our breath waiting for this event, we can obtain, read and complete the exercises provided in ""Anatomy of Success"" by Ronald A. Kaufman.

1612625,2,B00005JPJ8,"TheSecret revealed in this movie is what some call The Law of Attraction. That much should be clear by the time you read this review.

TheSecret is nicely presented. It employs nifty graphics and effects. Good eye-candy so to speak.

There are nearly 1000 reviews as I write this one, so I am not going to go into detail about what the movie talks about. Rather, what I'd like to bring to the potential viewer's attention are the serious pitfalls I found in this movie.

I found this movie to be very materialistic in its approach to reality and Life. I found it was tending towards a rather narcissistic way of utilising the Law of Attraction (LOA). The movie talks about how a few people throughout history have utilised the LOA to accumulate massive wealth, whilst leaving ""the rest of us"" in the dark. One only has to take a look around at the current state of the world to see that human greed is rapidly destroying the beauty here on this Earth. Human greed has, now and throughout history, created ecological disaster.

What I see TheSecret suggesting/implying is that now we can all fulfil whatever greedy desires we might have. It suggests that the notion of limited resources is a lie, and that we can all have whatever we want and however much of it we want. It mentions nothing of inclusiveness toward others, sharing, using the LOA to bring greater wisdom and awakening to oneself and others, and in fact very little that is of true value in a deeper sense. A whole segment of the movie looks at how one guy managed to get his 6 million dollar house -- like this is something we should all be seeking in this world, without considering the consequences.

I agree with the principle that we can all experience abundance and prosperity. I agree with the notion that our poverty and suffering is a creation that starts first within the human mind. I like the fact that this movie is opening peoples' minds to the fact that life is what we make it, and that we don't have to suffer our way through this world. I agree whole-heartedly with these points.

I do not agree, however, that the solution to this poverty will be found by people continuing to approach life and reality from a separatist/dualistic perspective (there is me, and there is everyone else). The challenge facing humanity at this time (especially those affluent enough to be buying and watching DVD's -- which is just a tiny fraction of the world's population) is not one of ""how can I create and accumulate more of what I desire"", but rather, ""how can I create and co-exist in this world with 6-7 billion other human expressions of Life in such a way that I am intelligently co-operating with those people, the Life within those people, and the Life manifesting as this world?""

""How can I use the principles of attraction revealed in TheSecret to add true creative and constructive value to humanity -- to the totality of which I am just one small unit? Is my purpose in this world to simply attract more material stuff into my hands and use?""

I found the presentation of The Law of Attraction within this DVD so shallow and simplistic that I am writing an ebook to address the matter. If you find this movie even remotely interesting, or if you too find it to be missing some major points, I encourage you to find and read this ebook in order to fill in the vast gaping holes TheSecret leaves for the viewer to either fill or stumble and fall into.

Be well, and enjoy the movie (and the popcorn),

With heart,

If you have a bad or compulsive thought nagging at you and its not in your best interest, you may as well indulge your whim because you cannot control the mystical powers that are forcing you towards acting on your self destructive thoughts or habits.

While it is true that a person is much more likely to achieve their dreams with focus and a positive attitude, I hardly think that it is a secret. Just good `ol common sense, motivation and attitude are required.",1174694400,10,566,4.66

We have seen huge improvements in our relationship and family dynamics as a result of ""The Secret"".

1612666,3,B00005JPJ8,"I run an Outplacement and career management firm in the Twin Cities.  After having worked with thousands of clients over almost thirty years, it has become apparant that although the mind has untapped and underutilized potential, thought alone will not achieve results without taking action to achieve your objectives.  The theory advocated in this DVD is very similar to that advanced by another famous motivator, Napoleon Hill in his best selling motivational book ""Think and Grow Rich,"" also available through Amazon.com.  This book, originally published in details a process that actually works and has probably made more people successful than any other book of its kind.

Overall, the Secret has an important message.  Belief, focus, and visualization are certainly parts of the formula, but overall if you do nothing, you will achieve nothing.  Persistence, an unwillingness to accept failure, a thirst to overcome all odds, making and acting on a plan to achieve your goals, and an unalterable conviction that you will succeed are as important as  belief and actually seeing yourself having achieved your objectives - whatever they are.  Yes I recommend the DVD or the book but only as a part of the solution.  Read Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich.""",1174694400,,1262,5.177339901477833

And there are some that will not give up their negativity at any cost as I can see from reading some of the reviews.  Those who are ready for it will reach the stars and those who are not will sit around complaining about this great work and anything else that could have taken them to a higher level.

A few years ago, I accidently put ""The Secret"" into practice without fully realizing what it was and why it was so important and the results have been amazing!

1612671,1,B00005JPJ8,"I've just bought and watched the DVD out of sheer curiosity. After all, so many great reviews must indicate that the DVD contains something truly ""unique"". I expected to see something really ""amazing"" in it ... hehe. And what did I see? A bunch of millionaires doing one big infomercial. An infomercial for what? For their businesses, of course. By the way, I've bought the book too ... and - for your information - at the end of the book, under each of the interviewed people's names, there are website addresses to their businesses. Hmm ... a coincidence? If you actually think this book and this DVD were created to ""change"" your life, and that they were created purely out of concern for your own well-being ... think again. It's all about money - the author and all of the interviewed people in the movie are the ones who are getting rich at the cost of your wallet, and at the cost of you being naive. Wake up folks.

Now, I haven't learned ANY ""secrets"" from this DVD. Nothing - absolutely nothing - that had been said in the movie, is new to me. If all you've heard in this movie really is new to you ... then you must have a very limited knolwedge from reading and researching (I'm not saying this to offend you). It is no ""secret"" that the human mind has extraordinary powers. It's no ""secret"" that these powers were known to humans thousands of years ago. And NO, it has NOT been hidden from us. Eastern philosophies are (and have always been) actually openly talking about it ALL THE TIME. There are THOUSANDS of books written on this subject. And the bunch of crooks that made the DVD claim that it's been hidden? LOL ... a good one. Like I said ... it's nothing new. Please don't waste your money. Instead, put it to some more beneficial use.

The people who made the DVD are taking credit for something they did not discover, and yet they claim that this DVD is telling you about something that no one has ever told you about before. I don't know what kind of a person will actually believe this crap.",1174608000,15,2016,4.416666666666667
1612672,5,B00005JPJ8,"The purpose of my 2 cents is to acknowledge that yes the marketing of the DVD is rife with material wants...unfortunately/fortunately however you want to look at it, our societies selling tool is targeted foremost by the aquisition of things--its what gets us to buy.  Yes this is how The Secret comes across from a marketing strategy (A good one I must add).  But upon further ""LISTENING - COMPREHENDING"" it is about so much more...thats just what catches the attention quickest...there are many principles to this law and if done with intent...you will grow beyond the ""material aspect"".  Just, being in a state of thankfulness and gratitude (1 law - no matter what your desires/wants), your inner spirit/guide/god or whatever you choose to call it, can bring a balance to self innately, and trust me your primary focus becomes more than just acquiring things or money... you will also seek/draw to you peace, harmony, health, and happiness in the midst of ""LIFE"".  Hey, so what if you test these principals initially in the aquisition of things--all is good, there is nothing wrong with wanting.  The only thing to potentially happen is your belief/faith will expound when it manifest, which will bring you closer to the essence of who you realy are...And if this happened in mass numbers...imagine.... To all the believers and naysayers alike...whether you believe it or not...it's happening. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts.....Namaste",1174608000,8,1458,5.058333333333334
1612673,2,B00005JPJ8,"My wife loved the ""Opera"" show about The Secrete so much that we both wanted to get the video.  We were expecting more information about the author's personal story but instead the video is made up of shots of the speakers giving their speeches and it comes across as a low-budget documentary.

The production is so poor that it's hard to watch it all the way through (cheesy, repetitive and sometimes boring).  The content is very similar to original ""universe"" thinkers such as Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich"".

If you've never explored self improvement products maybe this could help, if you can sit through it.  This is not worth the $29 in my opinion.  Get it used at a discount if you really want to see it.  This is just a money making/marketing gimmick with no real applicable answers to the curiosity generated by the Opera show(s).  This is pure marketing with no real value.",1174608000,11,891,4.666666666666667
1612694,5,B00005JPJ8,"Nothing new in this movie, but the fact that it is reaching a whole new audience is very exciting. Loan it to all your friends..........even if they don't ""get it"" maybe a seed will be planted. I tell people to get past the first ten minutes with all the whispering and new age hoopla. I'm not crazy about the fact that the movie highlights getting an expensive necklace or a mansion and a million dollars as being the compelling reason to watch this movie but those things are in fact important to alot of people. I believe our future depends on each of us having a ""visualizing and attracting"" mentality that will bring the end to war as a means to bringing peace. We can eliminate world hunger, genocide, street gangs, human slave trafficing to name but a few. To be able to create a great life at a personal level with satisfying relationships, a good job, and all the other things that might keep us from living a loving, peaceful and prosperous life. That these things are possible by believing in the law of attraction and then hopefully pursuing more information about our human experience in a spiritual body is the real reason for watching this movie and searching for more answers. That a better world might get a jump start with this movie makes me feel pretty darn good. We should have gotten there long ago! I also recommend ""What The Bleep Do We Know"". The  critics, scientists and nay sayers will never have the proof they demand, so I don't even bother to explain why I know the ""secret(s)"" are real.

1612696,3,B00005JPJ8,"Initially, I was inspired by the book so I bought the DVD.  The DVD is more concerned with getting material things, so i didn't enjoy it as much.  The book had more insight into more spiritual and emotional desires.  However, I don't feel either really explained how to proceed on a day to day basis other than ""putting up a picture"" or ""acting as if you had it"".

Nothing is to big if you can concieve it you can achieve it. Not one mention of morality or ethics is made. It seems that some people have forgot that we are just one person among 6 billion and sorry to say that everyone cannot be a multi millionaire or be a beautiful supermodel. Although we can all be rich and beautiful in our own way. It really is horrible to even suggest that a starving child may cause his own fate ,because he or she thought about it first. Perhaps the quadraplegic in the wheelchair would beg to differ,that his thoughts are manifesting his reality. I'm sorry but this is really some pie in the sky stuff and ultimately really cruel to consider. Perhaps if the folks in the movie held there heads under water we could all see how they will manifest gills on thier necks. Check out thier website and you will see how thier real desire is to get you to buy into a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme,forty dollars worth of stuff for two thousand dollars.

I have known ""the secret"" for years now, from wonderful authors like Dr. Wayne Dyer, Jerry and Ester Hicks, and of course from the likes of Oprah- but this film really gives you the tools to put ""the secret"" into action.

We're starting a dream board this weekend!

I find it so sad that there is such controversy about such wonderful news.

It seems anytime such positive information is given to the people, there is always a negative lash-back.  I suppose it is the simple fact the world is filled with darkness, as well as light.

This is a movie the is truly light- light of ""God"", ""The Universe"", or ""Love"", whatever you'd like to call it.

Plain, simple, powerful.  My Mom always used to say ""Whatever you think, comes to be"".  She was right.  I wish I grasped that concept 30 years ago.",1174608000,5,985,4.386740331491713

Although the concept is not new the film does present it in a unique and clear way.  And although I do believe in the fundamental message of attraction, I still find the film less than adequate in its presentation.  I believe that it focuses too much attention on the materialistic aspects of getting what you want, everything you want, the sky is the limit, greed has no bounds,  what you want.  In fact, I think ultimately it is playing on those baser emotions as it endlessly promotes itself and future productions.  It is in reality the commoditization of truth - truth as a commodity to be bought and sold to the highest bidder, or at least to those willing to fork out the outrageous price of $30 dollars. It promotes the idea that greed is ok, because even if we are all greedy there is enough to go around. It doesn't deal at all with the idea that there are certain things we shouldn't want or even with the idea that the law of attraction works equally well for you and me as for despots and dictators. In addition, it denies the fact that other laws must also be in play.  Did 6 million Jews really attract their deaths? Do the thousand of AIDS babies really attract their fate? If so doesn't that mean they got what they deserved? And what if my desires are in conflict with someone else's does it really boil down to who wants their desire the most. If the law of attraction is based in truth, as I believe it is -- and has been taught more  elegantly and purely in the book, "" As a Man Thinketh""  -- it should be balanced with the idea of responsibility, of wanting or desiring the right things and the realization the not everyone deserves or necessarily  attracted what life has given them, good or bad.",1174608000,2,1893,4.796923076923077
1612737,4,B00005JPJ8,"I do not normally go in for self-help material, however this product was attractive to me as it was easily understood and interesting to view.

The thesis is that Positive thought empowers the Law of Attraction [LoA]to bring you good things to your life. Whereas Negative thought combined with emotion, causes the LoA to bring bad things to your life.

While I am not entirely sure I agree with the whole viewpoint, I have to say that applying the advice has indeed caused small things of good to happen. Parking spaces that weren't available now are, etc.

So while I'm not particularly excited by changing my comfortable [if a bit cynical] viewpoint, I have to admit it's working at the moment.",1174608000,2,696,4.735537190082645

1612764,2,B00005JPJ8,"I think visualizing every day mundane tasks helps in performing them well, but from experience wishing yourself to greatness doesn't work.

I know quite a few people that think about being a millionaire all the time and aren't.

And I know one or two that are rich and don't think about making money at all. They either a) Inherited a chunk of money or b) Happened to enjoy doing something that was the right thing at the right time. These rich people enjoy being rich but none of the ones I know spent time trying to think themselves into the position.

I think visuallizing something like a swing in tennis can help, but visuallizing being rich or strong won't make you either and is a waste of brain power.

Most people who just try and wish themselves to be rich, try 'get rich quick' schemes and fail. Those that make it, it is often just a side effect of some other obsession (sports, beating the stock market, winning the deal etc.)

Ok If you imagine being the best stacker of books every waking moment you stand a chance because there isn't much competition. But if wanting to be rich or famous or a Nobel peace prize winner, and in reality thinking about it and visuallizing it was a big factor, then nearly everybody would be rich and famous.

In fact sometimes my brain gets tired worrying about something and doing something totally different and not even considering the problem allows the sub-consious to suddenly pop up with an answer I am looking for.

Also, as an altenative, how about if you spend time thinking about what you can do for others, then you can certainly get satisfaction and respect and in turn happiness and that is far more attainable than wishing yourself to riches or fame.",1174521600,,1711,4.571895424836601

We found it to be what we always knew, believed in our minds, heart and soul, however at different times in life we lose site of it until we need to rely on it.

It gave me such a sense of hope and inspiration that anything is possible.  I firmly believe that with focus and practice that anyone can change the way they think.  I have a lot of years of behavior to unlearn but I watch The Secret every few weeks to re-focus and get back on track.  I was so moved by it that I bought 3 copies, one for myself and 2 to give to my other sons. It would be a wonderful DVD to show all children in schools so they could learn this lesson early in life and not have to alter their thought process later in life.

However, it is the negative society that is shoved down our throats that keep us down. We as a society are responsible for that. Now, The Secret is the hammer that will help people (that choose to) to break down that barrier. As many have said, there are other materials that have discussed this subject. But, not a single one of them has had the impact that The Secret has had. I have heard that this book is dangerous....and I believe it is. It is dangerous because it makes us aware of what we are fully capable of. The people that call this book dangerous are scared. There is quote that defines this very clearly. ""What scare average people the most? They are scared of people going ABOVE average?"" Above is an understatement. I believe The Secret will open many doors for many people, again if they choose to. The DVD in combination with the book is perfect reinforcement. The DVD stimulates your senses.

I found that there wasn't so much ""new and amazing"" information here for me, but more a confirmation of what I already know - and utilize, daily.

I like getting those confirmations from the Universe!  Some new ways to look at things are presented.

Very upbeat, positive and hopeful!

This stuff works - even if you don't believe.  Follow the suggestions and test it for yourself.  You'll be amazed !

Not many people realize that some of them had ""poverty consciousness and low-self esteem"" for many years and that it took most of them over 20 plus years to turn their lives from desolation to restoration. This movie in essence is several capsulated formulas and postulates that will help anyone seeking to change the way they think....change the way that they view themselves and the world they CHOOSE to LIVE in and be. Plus, the Law of Attraction is one of many ancient Hermetic Laws stemming from the Emerald Tablets of Thoth.

The Secret invites you to change your way of thinking.  It invites you to implement the positive changes you want in your life.  If you want unhappiness, you invite unhappiness; if you want a happy, prosperous life, you invite that too.  It's all about mind set.  I found that viewing the tape several times to be inspirational, and this has truly changed my life.  I stepped out on faith and went into my law practice on my own.  I not only am still in business, (when everyone predicted failure), but it is prosperous and blessed.  Because I said it would be so and implemented my mind set to that goal.

We were not disappointed.  We are more convinced than ever before that the universe gives back what you give it.  If you give it positive thoughts, you get back positive responses.  Just focus your energy where you want it to go and things will fall into place.

Could it be just the power of positive thinking?  Maybe, if you choose to look at it like that.  I've chosen to focus on the positives in my life and what I want out of life, and so far, I am seeing positive results.  I no longer focus on the negatives, and I don't see anything negative happening as a result.

the problem i have with this philosophy is that it reduces god to a magician, our faith to ""if we do it right"", ""if we are good"", then we are rewarded.  in the christian tradition, that philosophy proven wrong by the death of jesus.  he was not prosperous or financially wealthy.  neither was ghandi.  the buddha renounced his wealth.  all credible religious traditions reject the concept of ""believe and the wealth will follow"".

this philosophy is put out by ""snake-oil salespeople"".  they must be laughing all the way to the bank -- they themselves have attracted money and we poor schmucks who purchased it have lost it.  however, i'd rather have my soul than money.",1174435200,10,885,4.596153846153846

I, personally, have used the law of attraction in the past (oblivious to the fact that I was using it)and it worked every time. When what I wished for came about, I perceived it as a miracle...which it was.  However, remember...the Bible says ""ask and it has already been given"".

I know there are those out there that say this can't be proven.  Well, there are many things out there that can't be proven...yet they exist, as we use them every day. Can you prove you exist?

Within minutes, I was feeling like a total fool, duped into buying something so ridiculous.  The DVD is terrible!!!  Lots of mysticism and focus on obtaining material wealth.  It is very poorly put together.

I fell asleep during the first watching, then made myself watch it a second time just to make sure I hadn't missed something that would change my life.  Nope - 'fraid not.

I leafed through the book version in a store recently and saw it contained some good quotes.  If you have to purchase a version, I would take the book over the DVD.  But honestly, they were both huge disapppointments.  What was Oprah thinking to recommend such hogwash?",1174435200,7,824,4.685314685314685
1612873,5,B00005JPJ8,"Watched this several times and the methods work, they corolate with my 90 yr old Grand Father's ministry teaching. Ask or pray (to universe or God, same thing) invision only the final result, then FEEL it as if it has already happened, believe it and thank The universe or God as if you had already recieved it, that's also called faith, in reality you trick your self into beleiving it and feel it in every cell of your body and when this happens you attract people who present you with opportunities that will get you to your goal.

This is the same thing as mind power or telekenesis, people feel an overwhelming disire to help you and by some strange power they are being attracted to you, this coincides with many things I have studied.

I highly reccomend this DVD, it's concepts are not new but it really helps to have a newer version of these concepts, follow it very carefully, take notes and make sure you are diong it correctly, do not ever think of or focus on anything bad, only fill your mind with good and it really is amazing how many good things manifest in your life, not over night but slowly, a little here and a little there, they begin to happen, don't be afraid then of change, take it by the hand and let it take you to your dreams.",1174435200,5,1256,4.340425531914893

Everything was ""revealed,"" but I was still somewhat of a skeptic.  I've never gone for ""new age"" stuff.  I've always considered myself someone grounded in reality, and this was hard for me to swallow.  However, because there were some things that I wanted to change in my life, I decided to have an open mind and try the methods taught in the DVD.  Surprisingly, changes have come about after only a short period of time.  I'm not sure if this is just coincidence or the power of magnetism taught in The Secret, but I do think that I am thinking in a much more positive manner, which is a plus, regardless whether the method works or not.  It has not even been a month, so I'll keep trying ""The Secret"" and see what happens.  I do like the way that I am thinking (""I can do that"" vs. ""I wish I could but something bad will probably happen""), and I think, for me, that's a huge improvement.",1174435200,3,1005,4.303191489361702

It was very good and reminded us in previous  times of our lives  when  we were positive we had positive things happen, so we knew it worked .

we  made a ""vison board"" as the authurs suggested and that is a  reminder to us  and  a ""vision"" of what we intend to achieve in our life .Already, although it seems we are always adding things to our vision board , things have ""started to change in our lives"" .the best part is: we seem happier and more content.  we recommend  you buy the movie as well .

What I see as the best part about this movie & book is it's generating interest in the Universal Laws, of which the Law of Attraction is only one.  So many people wander around in life without the slightest clue of why things happen to them, so they assign labels such as ""Bad Luck"" or ""Circumstance"" when it's simply the concepts presented in this DVD.

As I got older I started to believe the majority of the population -  I didn't have enough savings to retire - afraid I was to old and no one would hire me - the world was in a horrible state - fear took over and I became a ""responsible"", normal adult, doubting miracles could happen (even though I have seen many miracles occur) and keeping a job that was killing me with stress - The Secret just gave me that spark - that reminder that we are so very in control of our circumstances - I agree it is like an infomercial and is rather shallow - but, I loved some of the speakers and it gave me that push to start my meditations again and get away from the constant depressing messages we get all the time - kind of over-riding all the negative and having hope -  Those feelings have changed my life in a very short time, for that I am grateful.

I see how so very many people have no hope, let alone believe in miracles, I think that The Secret is probably the first and only positive message they have heard - I see no harm - I would much rather recommend this movie than suggest taking anti-depressants -  and perhaps the hour or so they are watching this they have missed a thousand depressing messages they would have been seeing on the news and other programs.

We are powerful - we are not victims - and I think that this DVD has the ability to help many believe that, or at least start them on a search for more positive material.

Some of the critis are so very harsh - I rather have my family sit and watch ""The Secret"" than ""Jackass"" or one of the many violent movies that have come out - I say the world needs ""feel good"" material and The Secret is just the start -",1174348800,5,1829,4.120786516853933

It does focus on positive thinking but the one thing people do not mention when talking about this is - taking steps to make things happen you can't just ask for something and have it fall into your lap while you're sitting at home.  You need to think positive about making positive changes in your life and think about the steps you can take to move toward the change.

1612929,4,B00005JPJ8,"THis is by far a phenominal DVD.

I first got it from my dad last thanksgiving.  I had no idea that the production quality was going to be as great as it is.  Some things were to my opinion somwhat farfetched, but with that said, it is an awsome dvd for those who want to understand why certing things constantly happen to them.  For all the critics out there listen to this: Its information to help you understand yourself and tells you basically what the power of positive thinking can do for you, which is something EVERYONE needs to practice. Yes its true to a HUGE extent that ""thoughts become things..."" To be successful in anything you have to have the drive the motivation the passion to achieve it, in spite of obsitcles, or else it ain't going to happend. You tell me, if you don't have a positive outlook, a drive, a passion for achieving any type of success, how far do you think your going to go?  Think about that.. and yes some things are a bit farfetched as I said and if you don't really listen to the fine details of the program you will come to the conclusion that the movie is just telling everyone all they need to do is sit back on their couch and think positive thoughts and them good things will mysteriously plop in their lap.  Thats not what its saying for the most part.  Its saying to not only be positive and to put those good thoughts of what you want out there but to also be attuned to infomration coming back to you from the universe.  Information in the form of Ideas or actions that must be taken before the results manifest and that is I think the next key step-ACTION!!  Thats what they say you have to be aware of as well. So don't misunderstand what is actually being presented.

For all my religious and conservative friends out there, this dvd need not be intimidating or that much conflicting with scripture because even in the bible it says ""as a man thinks in his heart, so he is..."" (proverbs 23:7, King James, new american standard, american standard version.)So lets not get too ruffled up over the positive aspects of this movie. So beyond the ""new age fluff"" of the dvd, see it for what it is; a of many tools to help guide you to achieving the things you want out of life.

The premise that manifesting thought into consciousness is a law of quantum physics makes the message of the Secret very powerful.

I'm generally an optimistic person anyway, so it wasn't an ""a ha"" moment to see them talking about how putting vibes out into the universe makes it come back to you on some level.  However, the way they indicate that wishing for something as specific as a bicycle will make it appear in your life is sort of ridiculous.

1613022,5,B00005JPJ8,"I thought this was excellent.  Very well written and so easy to read and understand.  But, applying the laws takes some practice.  This is well worth the practice as I already see results in my life.  This is really not new information but based on positive thinking that has been around for years.  However, the manner in which it is presented, is fascinating and really holds your interest.  VERY POWERFUL!!  Since I am also a Bible scholar, it was amazing on how much of this is actually taught by Jesus, but just using different words.  The law of LOVE was of first importance in the Bible, since GOD is descibed as LOVE.  To quote from the New Testament book of 1 John in Chapter 4 verse 8 it reads, ""He that does not LOVE has not come to know God, because GOD IS LOVE.""  The Secret brings out the importance of LOVE as also the Law of Attraction.  Thought and BELIEF AND FAITH are essential in the Bible in order for miracles to be performed.  Jesus and his disciples produced many miracles including raising people from the dead.  We think of only JESUS being raised from the dead but in the New Testament, Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, Paul raised Eutychus from the dead and Peter raised Tabitha (or Dorcas) from the dead.  When Peter tried to walk on water with Jesus, he did for a bit, than he became afraid and doubted.  When he did this, he began to sink and begged Jesus to save him. Jesus did.  He asked Jesus why he could not and Jesus answered saying, ""You with little faith, why did you doubt?""  The SECRET also tells us we must BELIEVE we already HAVE it for us to get something.  That is exactly in line with scripture.  This book has made a profound change in my life.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1174348800,6,1715,4.3841269841269845

I received my DVD a few days earlier than expected and watched it as soon as I got it. I watched the movie 7 or 8 times in that first week. I was calling up everyone close to me to come by and watch it. I was so excited to share!

The movie itself is sort of long 90 minutes to be exact. With this movie all my prayers are being answered. I am starting to see that light at the end of my tunnel that was so dark and dim before and I could not understand why.

I can only say that if you really follow their advice, and get really into what you want, you can have it.  I have had many doors opened to me in my life following some of these techniques.  Tony Robbins also uses some of them.  I think you will enjoy The Secret and what I have done is this: Whatched  it twice and then I passed it on.  I think everyone should do that. Ask the person you give it to, to pass it on to the next person when they are done.  There is nothing better then telling a secret:)",1174348800,2,627,3.9206349206349205

While of course I do understand that like attracts like, that is just the beginning. Creation is more complex than that. There are 3 components of creation in this world that we live in. Thought word and action. Thought is the beginning which should lead to word which is more concrete and more powerful than thought, which leads to action which is then more concrete and powerful in this world than either thought or word.

If you have (clarity, intensity, duration) of (thought, word, action) in this world you create. That is the formula. That is how you become a powerful creator in this physical world of time and space.

Unfortunately this program takes just one piece of that formula and expands it as if it was the entire universe. Hogwash. This program claims that clarity of thought is the whole answer. Well it just does not work that way.

What a surprise to find it is was mostly about making material gains! I have not read the book so I cannot say if it is the same, but I had hoped this DVD would be very enlightening toward the pursuit of good and not just in a material way. Very little mention was made of things such as health, happiness, love, peace and concern for others. Where is the focus on our planet and what good we could bring about by our thoughts, our feelings if we aimed them on the betterment of ourselves beyond the material? While there is nothing wrong with some prosperity - setting goals of multi-million dollar homes, jewelry, fast cars,etc seemed so shallow and so not worth the power of ""the secret""!  I am sure that ""the secret"" could very well be applied to a greater good, but what I kept thinking was this DVD is predominately about material goals.  It was a huge turn-off and I had a hard time watching the whole DVD.

I can see now how the law of attraction has directed my life down paths I really did not want to walk. By understanding this law I can take better responsibility for my life, my choices and bring myself to the paths I do want to walk.  After just a few weeks my husband and I have received several unexpected checks, have been able to smooth misunderstandings faster, and my health has improved.  I have taken this further by learning more about the teachers on the Secret [...].

Finally, I have found it to be a very simple thing to bring the principles and concepts taught in the Secret, which is the law of attraction, into harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is very important to me.

Not the message, mind you; the message -- which in this DVD revolves around the Law of Attraction--to think positively about something you want (rather than 'negatively') focus on ""it"" (instead of on something you don't want), and then be receptive toward ""it"" entering your life, is absolutely something we should all practice more of. But that's the extend of the video's content. That's it. That's the message.

I'm not exaggerating. There's really nothing more to the message. The video is an endless loop of a small handful of self-help gurus or self-described ""visionaries"" speaking about the ""Law of Attraction"" and its three precepts, over and over and over. And over. You get the full message within the first ten minutes. The rest is filler.

If after reading this much of my rant you're still wondering whether the purchase is worth it, try this first: tape-record yourself repeating endless variations of ""think positive"" for two full hours. Replay the tape. If your mind is already wandering five minutes into it or if you find yourself thinking, ""ok, I get it, be positive,"" then no, you don't need to purchase this DVD.

Hope that helps.",1174262400,15,1259,4.901408450704225

I wish it at least touched on Univeral Law, but I guess this is what they believe mainstream society is ready for... but that makes it seem very commercial, as it really focuses on attracting material things and wealth. I think they could have spent more time on health, spirituality, and the power positive energy can have on society as a whole, but that might be asking too much. I also thought that $30 was an expensive price to pay, but that seems in line with it beind so commercial. But, having said that, it was a very pleasant movie to watch and had a lot of positive reinforcement and it does leave the viewer with a very positive outlook. It works better as a pep talk to keep your mind on track and to keep you from getting wrapped up in the negative, than a theoretical or intellectual analysis.

If you want something bad enough, then keep telling yourself what it is you want (like a teenager wanting his/her drivers license).

Although the main concepts presented in the movie are for the most part correct, the ""whys"" they insert behind the concepts are questionable. Also, the whole idea of the thing being a ""secret"" is a hoax meant to invoke curiosity. It is so full of cheesy nonsense that it is hard to take the thing seriously, especially when they have ""visionaries"" talking about it. Overall, though, the concept can't hurt and isn't exactly WRONG.

You don't FEEEEEEEEEEEEL it.

You have to FEEEEEEL it to make it happen.  What is it, exactly?  Well it is the eternal manifestation of chimera-conduit-into-reality complexes as filtered through the mind-stream.

You have to FEEEEEL it.

All those poor people living in the ghettos, shooting crack, sodomising, bad-mouthing Jsus.

They don't FEEEEEL it.

All those people writing negative (Neg-a-tive/make-a-tiff...think about it) reviews for the SECRET, well they're obviously attempting to clog up the reality complexes with odious GREEN blood cells, thus trying to stunt the sails of the SECRET.  Why do they want to make other people, people like Rhonda Byrne, poor?

Because they don't FEEEEL it.

It has been calculated that the atmosphere directly above third world countries has been made thinner by their constant griping and make-a-tiff attitudes; this is why there is no water to make vegetation and food.  Well there's always water below the ground, you just have to think hard enough and it will rise to the surface.

1613368,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is not a movie or an adventure story.  It is like mini interviews.  Subject matter experts give you their takes on ""The Secret"".  One of them gives you a concept, explains it, then each of several experts discuss it with you and explain the ""how to"".  I give it 5 stars for its subject matter content and for, what I believe to be, its truth and accuracy.

With that said, ""The Secret"" is about accessing the Universal Law of Attraction (and the manifestation of Abundance).  Step-by-step, this video breaks it down in language and comparisons that are easy to understand.  The quick and dirty explanation is that you are as you perceive.  If you can really believe, remove all doubt, put emotion into the belief, focus intensely on what you want, and remove negativity from within yourself, you can likely achieve whatever you really want.  The video gives you more details on how to do it.

If you find it difficult to believe that you are what you perceive/believe/expect, break the concept down simplistically.  You get up today and spill coffee on yourself, as you are rushing to get out of the house.  You get angry, and then you rip your shirt trying to hurry up and pull it off.  Now you're really aggitated and thinking ""what else can go wrong?""  and ""what a day THIS is going to be!""  You just set yourself up for failure and your whole day will probably be rotten because you set the expectation that it will be.  Trust me, you WILL try to validate your own expectation that you have developed and you will draw negative happenings and people to you.  Now flip the scenario and don't even start off late, rushing and angry. Be peaceful, happy, thankful for everything and see how your day goes.  Smile at everyone, no matter who it is. Remove all judgements because you don't like the fact that someone has a tatoo, or wears different clothing than you do. I could say a lot more, but you need to watch the DVD to get it.  You can also watch an argument escalate between to people to watch the Law of Attraction at work, especially 2 cars on the interstate. One gets angry, blows the horn, hollers at the other and it just continues to escalate. They are attracting the anger that neither really want, but by sending the negative energy out there, they are attracting it back to themselves. I have seen the Law of Attraction in effect too many times to dis-believe it, especially since I have been consciously aware of it.

Of course, to clean yourself from the inside out, to remove all negative thoughts and emotions (hate, anger, jealousy, fear, envy, etc.), and to want something and really believe in achieving it BEFORE you have it--this is easier said than done. If it was so darned easy, everybody would be doing it. You need to actively practice gratitude, too, for what you already have.  (Right out of the DVD.  Not just me saying it.)

Let's say you're a grouchy crone and you get all this money.  You are rolling in it. So, you decide you want somebody to share it with, so you can enjoy life (travel, sit by the fireplace, whatever). If you're a nasty grouchy person, what kind of partner do you think you're going to attract? One who loves you with his/her whole heart???  One who will stand by you, no matter what?  What if the money disappears? That's why you need to get YOURSELF in balance.  Because what you think about is what you attract! If you BEHAVE nasty, you THINK nasty, and you ATTRACT nasty!  Hence, the Law of Attraction. And the more energy/intensity/emotion you put into the nastiness, the more nastiness you receive from those around you. If you want to be surrounded by love, YOU must be loving to attract that love!  (Duh.  It's really a no-brainer, but people are writing about it and making millions.)

The DVD also talks about how dis-ease manifests.  This topic alone could be priceless to you. Would you consider watching a video that might teach you how to never get sick again? Is it worth a try, even if you don't believe it's possible? Would you rather get seriously ill and then WORRY about it?  That will help, won't it?

If you are interesting in changing your life for the better AND you are willing to put forth a constant every day effort to do so, the principles in this DVD will help you get started. There are tons of tips throughout the DVD and it addresses the tons of questions in your mind. There is also a ton of other material out there to help you on The Law of Attraction (and the manifestation of Abundance), including Dr. Wayne Dyer's CDs and books.  These are life-changing concepts, if you're ready to accept them. All you hav to do is to watch the DVD with an open mind.",1174003200,4,4653,4.511933174224343

Intellectually, this may not come across as such a secret. In fact, Rhonda Byrne knew that there were other books and programs on this, but she also knew that it was a very limited number of people who knew about it, relatively speaking. All around us we see people getting rich off of gossip, death, deceit, destruction. It's refreshing to know some people are offering a glimpse of joy and hope and peace and love, for the price of Burger King dinner for a family of 5. If that makes them rich, great. They deserve it! May we all be lucky enough to earn a lot of money spreading happiness in the world.

For a while, though my life is already easy, abundant and prosperous, I felt that I was doing the same things over and over again. I was bored and stuck in the same experiences in my world. After I watched The Secret for the first time, within 72 hours, my life opened up magically. New opportunities were presented to me and I felt my world opening up like a flower. First, I sold a painting in a group show for the first time and 6 other paintings of my co-artists were also sold during the opening day. I have been joining that group show for the last 3 years and this is the first time that I sold a painting in that show. I got offers left and right for more group shows and for a solo exhibit. One wealthy art collector commissioned me to make many paintings to be sold in a fundraising event of a foreign embassy. Just this week, my son was pirated by another bank for double his salary, higher rank and other wonderful added perks.

I especially liked the attention paid to teaching the audience how to step from wherever they are to wherever they want to be.

Having said that, I will also say it raises many questions and is definitely controversial.

1613447,1,B00005JPJ8,"The ""Secret"" is made for simple minded, well fed, useless, and bored rich people.  It was created to relieve such people from unease and guilt.  So they can add self-importance to their frivolous lives and free themselves from senses of guilt and obligation...  One example of these successful marketing strategies I found particularly senseless and disturbing was the one of sending (gratitude?) rocks to South Africa, to sell them there and raise money.  Send rocks! There is no need to send money!  Did I get this right?  Why not quote Marie Antoinette's --one of the most brilliantly positive minded people in history! -- words of wisdom when she told her starving people to eat cakes?  Another quote that would have been equally appropriate is the one from our ex-vice-president Quail's when he exclaimed  ""They all look like happy campers to me!!"" during his visit in Africa.  True or false, who cares! ""The Secret"" is full of that kind of stuff anyway...  Stuff that would make anyone with an ounce of intelligence cringe.  Images of people living in utter poverty (India, Africa, etc.) are all portrayed with a smile.  They all smile.  The ""Secret"" 's message is clear:  forget the carnage some have suffered, the starvation, the epidemics, wars, etc.  These people are ""positive thinkers"".  So we are to believe that these people are inherently happy. The ""real unhappy"" people are those who have money, and crave for more privileges, and glamour...  and want even more of what they already have... Those who will waste their money on ""The Secret"" will add self-assurance to ignorance.  There is nothing there to learn.  It only tells you to act.  To act with the illusion of empowerment, and the belief that you are capable of being and doing anything you want, think or wish, even subconsciously...  It is not hard to imagine the unbearable combination of arrogance, ignorance, greed, and insecurity, with desires of super powers.

Please, let's not confuse ""power"" with ""strength"".  I think that power the way it is ""revealed"" in the ""Secret"" is quite negative.  It is also simplistic and destructive.  To give people the illusion that one can do anything, that limits are self-inflicted weaknesses, is obnoxious and dangerous. In stead of pushing limits, breaking confines, crushing boundaries, fighting demons, ignoring possibilities of failure, etc., one can learn to find infinite possibilities even in the narrowest confines...  Limits are ok.  Limits are useful.  One must have the strength to acknowledge their existence and live with them!  This will help whichever quest or goal one has--whether it is inner-peace, courage, love, the sublime, inner strength or whatever.  That to me is admirable...  Strength is admirable.

Empowerment, the law of attraction and the whole BS the ""Secret"" is selling us is a hoax.  History has proven that competition, and marketing do not create goodness.",1173916800,9,2910,5.0974576271186445

1613449,5,B00005JPJ8,"The first time I watched it, it really made me think. I admit, I had to watch it again to wrap my mind around some of it. So many of us go through life on ""dial tone"" just doing things ""automatically"" without really being aware of our thoughts, or our moods, we aren't even paying attention to what we are doing. Sometimes people are doing two to three things at once like trying to drive and talk on a cell phone while drinking a cola we got from a drive thru. And we wonder why things just seem to happen, why things are a mess.

Yes - this is information has been available for years and years - that is the point!! Yes - this is new packaging on information that has been around for centuries, that it the thing that makes this good. It is entertaining as well as enlightening and if you ""get it"" you will get it.

The only message in the DVD is to wish for what you want (as opposed to what you don't want) from the genie of the universe and it will appear.

The video made me take a closer look at my negative thoughts.  I finally saw that the things/situations I believed I could not do tended to result in things I wouldn't even try because I had made up my mind I wouldn't be successful.  As I watched the video I made small realistic swifts in my beliefs that eventually evolved to my complete determination to accomplish whatever I set forth.  The video also helped me to remember the times I used these techniques long before ever hearing about this dvd.  For example when I decided I wanted to move across the country many of my friends and family suggested how much money I should have saved before taking that big step.  I knew (with no proof whatsoever) I would be just fine, I would find work and a great place to live. I didn't have spare savings to help but also did not have any doubts and the people in my life who happen to be very practical just didn't understand that and yet I moved and I'm totally happy and secure.  As I said the Secret made me think of those things I believe I cannot do and instead of holding on to those thoughts I visualize the outcome I want and I research what I need to do in order to achieve it.  It's not necessarily easy but I found if I really started to believe it was possible then that 'work' became easier, enjoyable even and that's the gift I received from the Secret.",1173916800,,1480,4.279569892473118

1613477,4,B00005JPJ8,"No, this is not a new idea and not really a secret. But I believe it has become so popular because (besides the amazing marketing) it is explained in very simplified terms. After listening to/watching The Secret I felt like ""yeah, I can do that.""  But, and maybe I'm over thinking things a bit but, they use the principle of ""like attracts like"".  Okay, but what about the fact that opposites also attract?  They seem to totally ignore things that don't support the ideas they push.  Another thing that I was confused about... So I'm not supposed to think about the things I don't want, but rather what I DO want.  Sounds fair and simple enough.  But they say ""if you think ''I don't want to be late for work.  The universe hears ""I want to be late for work"".  So the all powerful universe has selective hearing?  I get it, but I don't get it.  But I have spent the money on the dvd and so I will try it out.

What this DVD packs in are empowering messages from incredible historical figures and extraordinary men and women here and now who are currently using this ""secret."" I firmly believe in the Law of Attraction, even though I might not have called it such all these years. The DVD might be simple in that it can be summed up to such phrases as ""Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find,"" or my favorite, the phrase that greets me every time I open my cell phone: ""If it can be dreamed, it can be done."" Still, simple as it, it is as a whole an important message.

For those who might feel uncomfortable or even offended that the commentators sometimes hint at the human self being its own ""higher power,"" that shouldn't be taken so literally. I think it's a universal way of reaching all schools of belief: in God, in Allah, in the universe, in fate.

And for those who shun this DVD, claiming it just says what we so badly want to hear, well, yes. Call us all hopeless optimists, but it's a wonderful world to live in when one knows he has the world at his fingertips.

You may not NEED this DVD. You might watch it and realize you already know what it preaches. I've done that parking space bit for years, and it never fails, even at the height of Christmas shopping season.

The Secret DVD presents dramatically and meaningfully one of the Universe's oldest laws - the Law of Attraction.

Producer Rhonda Byrne has come along to demonstrate in a moving and powerful way just how the power of mind can change lives for the better

She presents true case histories to show exactly how the age old Law  works. And the authors and teachers she features demonstrate truthfully how the Secret can bring about real positive change.

The book addresses how the Secret can impact on relationship, career, financial and indeed health issues - bringing about real life almost miraculous change through the power of thought and intention.

The DVD is full of enthusiastic people - it is presented in a logical and coherent thread. And when you have finished watching it you yearn to re run it and re run it yet again. This is self help magic.

While there is nothing new in the philosophy behind the Secret, the presentation has captured the minds and imaginations of many. My fifteen year old son applies it every day - and it works for him. We have all seen the changes first hand.

1613551,1,B00005JPJ8,"It is possible for the ideas covered in this DVD to make your life better, but not for the ""reasons"" the DVD talks about.  If you follow what it outlines, all that will really change is your attitude towards life.  You'll be eternally optimistic because you are ""absolutely positive"" that things will be good.  You will take more chances because you are ""absolutely sure"" that you'll reach your goal.  Good attitude and optimism will also improve your mental and physical health.  This is simply a way to program you to have a very strong positive outlook, which works wonders if you have it.  It is usually hard to get and maintain such a positive attitude.  This DVD can help some people to get and maintain such an attitude by making them believe (without any evidence) in some magical processes that will fulfill their dreams.  The real magic, if you can call it that, is your resourcefulness and openness which get unlocked when you ""know for a fact"" that things will work out.

This is not unlike many religions.  Religious people tend to feel better because they believe in a higher power that will see them through and, consequently, sometimes do better because of the resulting positive attitude and optimism.

1613624,5,B00005JPJ8,"I feel so blessed to own the original version with Esther Hicks. For those wondering what lead to the extended version, here's Esther words on it :

Copied from the Abraham-Hicks website:

THE SECRET

The Television Movie

From Jerry & Esther

Dear Friends,

Nearly two years ago, while on-board our Mexican Riviera Cruise, Prime Time Productions did an interview with Jerry and me, and with Abraham, in response to an agreement that we had all carefully crafted together for a television show that was to be aired in Australia called ""The Secret."" We were told that ""The Secret"" would be based on our work and that they would seek out other teachers who were in alignment with our work. We reviewed, on DVD, two other projects that had been created by this production company and found them to be beautifully done, and good-feeling pieces.

Since Jerry and I had never before stepped into the public forum in that way with our Abraham work, we followed the advice of our publisher, who introduced us to an intellectual property rights attorney who assisted us in drafting the agreement which would guide our involvement with this project. He explained to us that although he had included in the intellectual property rights license agreement that we were to receive a small percentage of the net profit from this project, and 10% of direct video sales, that it was very unlikely that (from his experience) we would receive any substantial compensation from our participation, and we were not unhappy with that arrangement. Our decision to do it was not motivated from the idea of making money from it, (unless there was profit to share) but because we were stimulated by the excitement of this beautiful producer, and when we met her and her beautiful crew, we easily loved them all.

As time went by, it became apparent that the television network that we had been told would air ""The Secret"" was not going to do it, at least not right now, and so the production company began seeking other ways of marketing their beautiful project to recoup their very large investment. While Jerry and I were uncomfortable with what felt to us like a rather aggressive marketing campaign (just not our style, nothing wrong with it) we stayed focused on our busy schedule and really had very little to do with what was happening with ""The Secret.""

Eventually we received an email from the producer of ""The Secret"" lovingly explaining (we never have received correspondence from her that was anything other than extremely loving) that the contract that we had all agreed upon and signed was no longer sufficient for their further distribution of the project in the areas they were now seeking to distribute the project, and that it would be necessary for us (Jerry and Esther) to relinquish our intellectual property rights in these areas forever and redo our contract or they would have to reluctantly edit us out. It was clear, from the lovingly written email that they did not want to edit us out, but after conferring with our publisher, and then our intellectual property rights attorney, and finally with Abraham, allowing them to edit us out was the path of least resistance. Abraham's words were very clear and easy to understand: ""Whenever you are given an ultimatum that says, 'if you don't do this, then we will have to do such and such,' it is best that you just let it go and move on. Otherwise there is always another, and this, and this, and this?""

Now, it seems there is quite a firestorm surrounding our dis-involvment with ""The Secret"". We are receiving so many emails and letters and face-to-face questions from disappointed people regarding this, so we want you to understand how we feel about it.

We think that ""The Secret"" clearly and beautifully presents Abraham's Law of Attraction in a way that is easy to understand. It is filled with stunning beauty and beautiful people, many of whom are our personal friends. We love the way ""The Secret"" moves us, and we feel joy rise within our hearts every time we watch it. We feel the power of it, and the clarity of it, and we love ""The Secret"".

It is our desire that, rather than being upset that our part of ""The Secret"" will be omitted in future offerings of it, that instead you enjoy the original Abraham version, as it is, at this time, and that you look forward to what other incredible things these talented people may bring to you. These are people who clearly care about the planet, who want to be of value, and who, in our opinion, are of tremendous value.

Financially speaking, we have been very well paid for our participation with this project? which has amounted to a staggering amount of money. And if money were the most important factor, we assure you, we would have found some way of staying involved.

So, we're out here doing our thing, enjoying the incredible expansion of the message of Abraham, and are so looking forward to the wonderful things that are in our future. Abraham says to us and to you:

It is our desire that you be easy about all of this. There is nothing that has gone wrong here. Everything is in alignment. The Universe will offer a steady stream of uplifting avenues to all of you.

There is great love here for you, Abraham.

Our love,

Jerry & Esther",1173744000,7,5255,4.693478260869565

Times when ""The Secret"" was just that,  a secret kept from the masses. It brings to life what most ""self-help"" books have spoken about for years. The viewer will be able to finally grasp what many philosophers, authors, and scientist have been saying for over 100 years, ""like attracts like."" You are what you think. The viewer will understand the power of our thoughts and how they affect our lives.

I got to say that ""The Secret"" is not really a secret, it has been under our noses forever, we've just missed it along the way. The Bible speaks of this secret in many passages. Minus all the ""new age"" stuff, its a good DVD, which helps you be positive, view circumstances differently, have hope, dream, realize dreams, and believe in yourself.

1613627,1,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD was disappointing.  The footage and music in the beginning gave a DaVinci code flavor to it, a suspense thriller twang - that was very disappointing, and somewhat embarrassing to the guest I was showing it to. I portrayed it in a serious manner, as did Oprah.  this DVD did not.  I feel the message of acting as if what you want already exists, or living as if you already have what you want and how you want to feel - that was lost with portrayals of money and material things, over and over again.

That should not have been the focus or even an intended outcome of this philosophy.  Mother Teresa was one of the richest women in the world, but she couldn't stand next to the Chicken Soup Man or the Entrepeneur and arrogantly state she lived in a $4M mansion.  She wouldn't even discuss what she had in monetary or material terms.

Because of this - this is a huge disappointment.  I am able to weed out the crap and apply the good points to my life, but I want to get rid of the DVD.  It's not worth showing to anyone.",1173744000,7,1031,4.219387755102041
1613628,3,B00005JPJ8,"Be careful what you think about. Be careful what you ask for. Control your thoughts and control your life. You are the commander. How actually? Throw out thoughts immediately if not to your advantage. Rethink or rephrase them immediately. That's what you do when you gently put thoughts aside during meditation. John Nash says he still hears voices, but has learned to ignore them. We must do that too. Learn to speak only in a proper manner to yourself.

Never say what you don't want. Construct a vision of what you do want. A good example is when Sister Theresa refused to go to an antiwar rally, saying, I'll go to a peace rally anytime.

What you hear you learn. My Dad would say ""that figures,"" when something went wrong,  My Mom would say ""don't do that, you'd be the one that gets caught""

The big issue. how do we acquire faith? It's a technique done by habit, not explanation. Repetition is the one force you have the most control of. Using repetition internally is the way. These things listed below happen to you and form your faith. Only the repetition is fully voluntary. The personal intellectual process is under your control somewhat, but sometimes it  isn't, like when you have habitual repetition of negative thoughts. Take control of it, through, will after a good internal conference with your personal intellectual process. That is, decide to use repetition in the manner your intention has chosen.

These things below happen to you and form your faith:

Fear

Intense experience

Parents

Real support

Social environment

Being convinced

Brain washing

Commentary; on the movie ""THE SECRET""

 About the so called ""law of attraction""

This movie is nice, to me, because they don't attempt to describe how or why this comes about, just that they observe it works. But the overblown and overproduced hype style is not well organized, slow, and annoying to me. It smacks of a new age evangelism. I have found that truth seems to come is small kernels among much sand. I'm developing the patience to do the work of separating the wheat from the chaff therein.

Here's what I think they are going for;

Think of yourself as a magnet

whatever is going on in your mind is attracted to you

control and hold on to the thoughts you want ----(not don't want)

clarity is absolutely essential to visualize as exactly as possible how it is in human terms. How it looks, feels, tastes, smells, and sounds  --- all of them.

THE PROBLEM IS; THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T WANT

it works every time

The law of attraction doesn't respond to negatively phrased requests.

ex; I don't want to be late. it only responds to the visualization of ""late"" The visual image of what you don't want is the problem. (I'm great at this)

It works all the time---whatever you're thinking.

Learn mind control of the conscious and unconscious so that they follow the demands of your intention. through daily repetition. (John Painter's physical method)

be careful; it works if you are thinking about the past, present, or future. (negatively phrased and visualized thoughts about the past are as harmful as ones about the future.)

A Scientific American article in the March 2007 issue says that past, present, and future thoughts ( and imaginings) all occur in the same specific brain cells. I read that just before seeing this movie.

 CREATION IS ALWAYS HAPPENING

passion makes it faster

angry = negative

Program your subconscious like governments and advertisers do! ""They will believe anything if you repeat it enough"",

Have a certain firmness, Physical and mental.

Avoid analyzing, understanding --- these not necessary to use it --- like using electricity !

Positive thoughts are much more powerful. Don't fear your negative thoughts. Just rephrase them quickly to a positive goal. Eventually you will phrase that way habitually.

Time delays in manifestation is useful. It allows for rethinking and changing course as necessary

 Have FUN with it

You've already attracted everything in your life PROBABLY MOSTLY NOT ON PURPOSE!

you must monitor all your thoughts  ---soon it becomes fun

your feelings tell you how you are controlling your thoughts. Start by feeling good.

""You don't get blessed because of your good works. You do good works because your are blessed. --- Get blessed!""  (Or actually notice you already are.) NHDH

Feeling good first is the basis on which this is built. Recognize and develop gratitude for what you do have. That builds the good feeling that makes it all work. Posture (physical) is an important component. Like  smiling first causes your system to feel good afterward, so also the posture of well-being creates the feeling of well being. Use method acting. Provide the feelings of having it now,

AVOID EFFORT!

Every day close your eyes and visualize the goal as if it's actually achieved

Trust and act on your inspired thought

Financial Debt,

The goal of getting out of debt will keep you in debt forever

Focussing on what you don't have stops it

Focus on what you want, not what you don't want

Your doubts will manifest

Have your house and environment express your desires

As you love yourself, you'll love others, Having the feeling of gratitude and posture gives a feeling of strength--- which makes you love yourself. It's not hard to notice gratitude. Start with something easy like, ""no asteroids have hit recently,"" Appreciation and gratitude are the driving force for all of this. It's not hard at all to start there. A quick thought of gratitude changes your system immediately. No one else can help you. You must do it. Take charge of your subconscious by Hitler's methods.

the placebo effect is proven and WORKS

HEALTH

Daily or more often

Set it up that you are already healed!

See yourself in a perfectly healed body

Focus on joy and gratitude not the disease

Shift attention away from your symptoms

Let nothing into your mind that could distract you from your vision

Man becomes what he thinks about

You can't obliterate what you don't want. You can attract what you do want.

What you resists persists

It's not your job to change the world

BECOME INTENTIONAL

""you don't have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step."" MLK

""whether you think you can or you can't, either way you are right"" Henry Ford

THERE IS NO BLACKBOARD IN THE SKY WHERE GOD HAS WRITTEN YOUR PURPOSE, YOUR MISSION. YOUR PURPOSE AND MISSION ARE WHAT YOU GIVE YOURSELF. (this is a new and big one for me.)

THE PRIMARY AIM IS TO EXPERIENCE AND FEEL ---JOY ---IF IT AIN'T FUN---DON'T DO IT.  How do you do that? Think vividly of something good that did that in the past. Then while still feeling that way, visualize having what you want. (Same as getting gratitude going)

First, put yourself in a state of gratitude, pet your cat, walk in the woods etc. when you feel good, then have the intention of what you want. Don't waste time doing this when you feel bad.

INNER HAPPINESS IS THE FUEL OF SUCCESS. --- START THERE.

""YOUR GOOD WORKS DON'T MAKE YOU BLESSED, BEING BLESSED CAUSES YOUR GOOD WORKS"" NHDH

IT'S ALL TECHNIQUE!!!

""You can't discover the unknown while you are in the known.""

J. Krishnamurti

SUMMATION (how to do it)

Do as often as possible --- a minimum of once a day

1, WRITE OUT WHAT YOU WANT

2. GET TO A POINT OF GRATITUDE

3. SAY AND VISUALIZE WHAT YOU WANT (YOUR NEW  ---""IS"")

4. TAKE A DEEP BREATH, TENSE, HOLD, AND RELEASE SLOWLY

5. GET AND STAY BLANK",1173744000,3,7518,4.8015625

1613630,1,B00005JPJ8,"The popularity of this item, and the positive reviews, are more and indication of a weakness in American society than of the quality of the product. People like to feel that there's something out there which is going to resolve the issues they can't handle and this DVD plays up to that. It's snake oil. Nothing more.

What a shame there's no 0 star rating.",1173744000,12,357,4.492307692307692
1613631,5,B00005JPJ8,"In a nutshell, it just gave me the few tools I needed to change my thinking and enjoy a more calm, serene life.  After years of battling anxiety and anger - just shifting my thinking allowed me to reduce those feelings in a very short time.

Last week I had to fly to assist a relative who had had surgery.  I hadn't flown in over two years because I had an anxiety attack during the last flight I'd been on.  I had to have my husband overnight a prescription of Xanax so that I could get on the flight home.  Needless to say, I was worried about taking this flight.  Not only did I take the flight, which had a connection requiring another flight, but on the return trip, after the first flight to my connection, my flight was canceled unexpectedly, and I had to spend the night in a strange town, and end up taking two more flights the next day.  Using a spirit of gratitude for just being able to fly (thanks to the Wright brothers) - I sailed through this experience - without popping open that bottle of Xanax in my purse.

I wish I had the funds to purchase this DVD and/or book for everyone in my family.  Our whole world would be a better place if we all could subscribe to these tools presented.

I think I will be buying the book now - to see if there is more detail, and more tools I can incorporate into my life.  I want to live!!",1173744000,4,1342,4.142857142857143
1613632,4,B00005JPJ8,"It was a good program.  Could get a person started down a different path. I am technically challenged and had trouble figuring out how to get out of the trailer into the main story,,,but that is probably not the fault of the dvd.

1613633,4,B00005JPJ8,"The first time that I watched this DVD I was a little overwhelmed with all that it had to offer....lots of information coming at you.  I had to watch it a couple of times to get the message they are wanting you to hear.  I liked it, just had to be 100% ready to take it all in.",1173744000,2,277,3.7586206896551726
1613664,5,B00005JPJ8,"I am so very happy that I purchased this DVD.  I knew most of the tenets presented in the secret, the element that was missing is what changed how I apply this idea to my life.  I have told everyone I know to purchase this DVD so they can refocus their lives in a positive way.  Thank you Rhonda Byrne for sharing this information.  You have helped countless people to understand how and why their present lives just aren't working.",1173744000,,432,4.3625
1613665,5,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD was excellent. I want to view it over and over again. It provided some pretty simple tools to help attract that which we want in our lives.

1613667,5,B00005JPJ8,I heard about the Secret on Oprah.  It's great advice.  This DVD is for everyone (children and adults).  It was a good way of taking in the concept and it had good examples that even a child could understand.  I highly recommend it.  It will give you a different outlook on life and the way we live it day to day.,1173744000,,313,4.065573770491803
1613668,5,B00005JPJ8,"As I watched the Secret (alone ,the first time) I was totally captivated by the pure common sense of it's philosophy.

It is advanced thinking and if you are ready, it can make a huge immediate impact in your life.  If you are not ready, just watch it again and again until you get it.

1613670,5,B00005JPJ8,"I had heard about this video from a number of different sources, but I was only able to locate it easily on Amazon.com.  I wasn't sure if it would live up to all the hype, but I have to say that in my opinion it certainly does. A month later I bought the book as well to have the concepts taught in the video at my fingertips.

If you are in a place in your life when you want to make some changes and began to attract some positive energy into your life, this video is for you. Just watching the video by itself isn't going to attract prosperity, but the concepts make sense and open you up to become the best ""you"" you can be.",1173744000,,628,3.9761904761904763
1613671,5,B00005JPJ8,"I think The Secret was a great DVD. If there is something out there that can make people feel good and awaken their positive thoughts than that is wonderful.

I have implemented some of the information into my life, and am a better person because of it.  I lent the DVD to several friends and family members, and just received it back; I can't wait to watch it again!",1173657600,,380,4.4

1613699,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've always been a worrier.  Two weeks after receiving my copy of The Secret, and watching it twice, I was involved in a potential tragedy.  My son, and two other men, were lost in the snowy woods overnight.  While Search and Rescue crews were combing our rugged back country, I waited at home.  Remembering the Law of Attraction, I refused to get bogged down in the pits of ""what if,"" and instead sang a song of ""my boy is fine"" over and over again silently to myself, while making positive plans for cooking a meal.  People around me were amazed by my composure, ability to focus, and my spirit of preparing for the best.  I had just returned from the grocery store, with lunchmeats and breads I hadn't planned to buy, and large mochas I had when my son and his companions just walked in the door cold, hungry, and tired, but fine.  They eagerly drank the mochas and ate the sandwiches we made.  One woman called me a rock star and my husband strongly complimented me on my behavior at such a stressful time.  To me, the price I paid for The Secret was paid back to me a million times over.  I didn't fall apart, nor did I feel my body suffered ill effects from the stress I should have been under, therefore...I worry no more.",1173657600,4,1229,4.350877192982456
1613700,5,B00005JPJ8,"I ordered the DVD and I must say I have watched it several times.  I also have the CD's which I constantly listen to in my car, it is downloaded on my IPOD and I have the book to read at the beach while I relax.  I can relate to the contents of the book because I am a Christian and The Secret is based on Biblical principles.  My kids watch and listen to it with me and they even believe in the contents and decided to make a vision board with a Play Station 3 on it (smile).  I made one myself and am anxiously waiting for my visions to become reality. I can remember as a little girl I used to wish for things and count on my fingers 10 times and it would happen.  I think our minds are really powerful tools and if we can use them to create destructive things why not use them for productive measures.  The lady that healed herself from only listening to happy things is a technique I used after my mom died to keep myself in a cheerful mood.  God is good and His word is true.  The secret is only a combination of God's word and from another best seller, The Power of Positive Thinking, which was also based on the Bible.  So I feel people should try the principles for themselves, what harm could it be to think positive thoughts continuously.",1173657600,3,1249,4.106995884773663
1613701,5,B00005JPJ8,"The Secret is not a secret but for many many people it may be. Even after they see it, The Secret will remain an elusive mystery. The Secret is simply the Law of Attraction. It does work, but knowing how to do it doesn't mean everyone will be able to, or want to. Several sections have been critisized as ""magical thinking"". This is ignorant and naive. However, if you only went by the information in 'The Secret' it is understandable since 3 important steps were left out. The primary one being ""action"". You cannot sit in a closet, ""ask, believe, and receive"". Sorry, but you will be sitting there for a long, long time with 0 results. Other sections that were critisized was the woman who cured her breast cancer without the use of western medicine i.e. chemotherapy and/or radiation and/or surgery. She did it in approx. 3 months. Critics say that gives the impression that one doesn't need western medicine. Even though in the same section one of the teachers specifically states if you have an illness that is acute or severe that absolutely get treatment while you explore what the mind can do. It isn't saying it ""will"" cure canvcer, it is saying ""it can"" cure cancer if the person doing it is able to do it so well that they can rearrange their own cells and immune system. How may people can tap into that? Near the end of the DVD there is a great segment on a man who was in an airplane accident and crushed his spine and diaphram etc. and was told he would never walk or use his limbs again and would have to stay on a breathing tube for the rest of his life. He was able to heal himself through the power of his mind, and thoughts. Yes, it is possible. Can anyone do it? Maybe. We all have a mind so theoretically yes. They call this guy the miracle man and isn't called that for nothing. Can you cure damaged parts of your body with ones mind, be it cancer or broken bones? Sure you can. Will you? I don't know, will you? That is the question. Since we all have our own thoughts and patterns whether one can take this information and use it is a whole other story. Most people I would say won't. They are too stuck in their habits of ""knowing"" everything to actually open their minds and then do what you need to do and really make a change in your life. That is something most people are not willing to do. The other critisism I have is that they do not explain on a scientific level what is occuring inside your body to your cells that creates the energy you are emitting. There is a reason why people who are miserable all the time, are miserable all the time. It is their habit to be that way and by golly no one is going to tell them any different. Their own cells demand it.  On the Larry King show, he asked one of the teachers, If everyone uses the Secret, who will clean the streets and drive the buses?"". It is a silly question. It's silly becaue everyione uses the secret whether they want to or not. The answer is, the people that want to drive the bus, or don't want to drive the bus. Either way, they are still using the Law of Attraction. If everyone used the secret in a positive way, then only the people that want to drive buses will drive buses. It may be a gravy job for some. No stress after you clock out, do your shift and go about your life. That is appealing to many people. Bottom line is that if you are intrigued by the Secret than do more research. Read about Quantum physics. There are amazing things happening right now like photographing one object in two places at the same time. I beleive MSN is doing a story on time travel and if it is possible. These are not new concepts, String theory is taught at many of our countries top universities. The Secret should inspire you to want to learn more and that is always a good thing. Hope you will read my book which should be available sometime this year, entitled 'Dirty Little Secrets' Till then, keep thinking good thoughts!

I believe this is truth and applies to every single person's life no matter where you live or what you believe.  I am sure that each person has see it in action in their lives in one way or another.

In less than a year I now own not one but TWO sucessfull bussinesses.

I wanted my friends to be able to experience the same joy and happiness I now have, without having to read book after book like me. I saw this DVD and relalized it was a wonderful crash course in everything I have learned. So if you need a pick-me-up or a drastic life change WATCH THIS MOVIE (or read the book =) It's not hoo-haa 12 step BS it is a powerful message and if you take it seriuosly it WILL WORK! I am living proof. And I know many of you are thinking well I am a christian or muslim or whatever... will this interfere with my strong held beliefs? And the answer is no ""The Secret"" is based on core principles that are the basis of most major religions, I am a christian and I can say it truely enhanced and reaffirmed how I feel about myself and the world around me.

I read one post calling it ""watered down"" and it is true there are more intense versions of the same teaching out there but when I want to feel peaceful and happy the last thing I want is intensity that is why ""The Secret"" is perfect for me and anyone else who feels they need a little light in their life.

Two, they really kind of gloss over the fact that you do need to actually DO something about your life, not just visualize it.

1613868,3,B00005JPJ8,"Here is the gist of the secret.  Your thoughts are what happen to you.  If you think good things, good things will happen.  If you think bad things, bad things will happen.

Watch the DVD for details.

However, let's take a look at their theory.

Is it possible to prove it wrong?  The answer is that no, you can't prove ""the secret"" to be wrong.  If you say ""I'm thinking positive thoughts but bad things keep happening!"" then they will say ""no, you're not thinking positive thoughts, because if you were, then positive things would happening. it is the universal law -- so start thinking positive thoughts"".

Since there is no way to disprove the secret, then its not science.  Which might be fine to you -- feel free to pay for this secret.

The secret is really just like a religion, you will have to believe in it, so I'm not here to say its right or wrong.

I do believe in the power of positive thinking, but more so as a psychological effect rather than as a physical, scientific effect that does something hidden in the universe.

So, feel good, think positive thoughts...just realize that you usually do have to DO things to GET good things.  =)

My $0.02.

Oh yeah...and the last thing I have to say is that this is a less informational message that copies the main idea from Napoleon Hill's book ""Think and Grow Rich"".  So go read that ""classic"" book, instead of this wannabe video that tries to convince you with silly ""inspirational"" sounds, and <sarcasm>such convincing arguments</sarcasm> -- they talk about the story of the genie and his 3 wishes -- and the original story had infinite wishes...think about it, if a story had the guy with the genie, then the genie is for real...you can ask for anything you want, just wish it!!!",1173657600,4,1746,4.544871794871795

1614043,5,B00005JPJ8,"I had heard about ""The Secret"" last year from a friend but never took the time to read the book or watch the dvd. In Nov. 06 my mother passed away from breast cancer at 65 yrs. old. I have greived heavily for four months as did my father. I was visiting him one day and turned on the t.v. to find OPRAH hosting the show of ""The Secret"". I grabbed my dad to watch it with me and immediately ordered the DVD and watched it. I was very moved and felt this was helping me so I mailed it to my dad. He watched it and ended up ordering his own copy and sending mine back to me. Meanwhile I ordered the CD's and the book. I know this theory has been around for centuries but if it works for us then let us have this to empower us to turn our negatives into positives and live the life we want.

The Law of Attraction is not just about creating wealth on a material basis in one's life, it is about calling into one's life the abundance that the creator/universe/God has always intended for us to have in all areas of our life. The teachers in the DVD make so many aspects of the Law of Attraction clear in each their own way and through their own actions; that makes a compelling argument for it. I am grateful to Rhonda Byrne for her labor of love and for sharing it with us.",1173571200,4,641,4.262295081967213

I have heard of the universal energy several times throughout my life and how it makes up all things and surrounds us. Realising that our thoughts too are energy, and attract things and people into our lives (the law of attraction) is very important to remember. This video drives that home over and over again and makes you realise that most people think of the things that they don't want, and that they are worried about constantly and therefore attract these things over and over again.

Like attracts Like, at least in this producer's head.

In the rest of the REAL physical universe, opposites attract.

If you REALly want to know how the laws of attraction work it's no ""secret"", just take a look at a battery. One end has a ""+"" symbol on it. The other end has a ""-"" symbol on it and the ONLY reason it supplies electrical current is because opposites attract.

The only reason any of us are here is because our two parents, who were the ""opposite"" sex, were ""attracted"" to each other.

There is nothing ""metaphysical"" about the secret. It's a waste of $30. I'm ashamed to admit that I got caught up in the hype after Oprah peddled it twice on her show.",1173571200,6,692,4.333333333333333

I gave this movie to my friend for a week and she followed all the steps and her life turned around in a matter of three days.

We say we are against war, but we perpetuate violence and crime through our ""entertainment"" in movies and on TV. We could end war and violence and poverty and crime and racism and all the other destructive behaviors we say we don't like by changing our own attitudes and behavior.

This movie reinforces that everyone has a different perception of what reality is and that reality is directly affected by how they see their world - half-full or half-empty.  People like to be right so they will look for situations or people that reinforce their own perception - even when the perception is negative and not what they truly want.  It sounds so simple - change your perception and change your world.  And the truth is that it is what we do when we hit the bottom and have to pick ourselves up to get better.  This movie is what you pop in the DVD player to remind yourself that whatever circumstances you find yourselves involved in, you can decide to stew in the sadness or look forward and find the good in what you encounter.",1173484800,9,799,4.520833333333333

If that's the case, it will surely provide more answers and clarification to the questions and doubts many viewers are struggling with.

The Secret embraces both Eastern and Wesern spiritualities. But the teachings pull largely from basic Buddhist (all sects) practices and beliefs - including reincarnation, the awesome power of stillness and utilizing unseen Divine-to-human energy systems.

The Secret as it is, cannot possibly cover its intense and profound  teachings in one, two, three - or more - books and DVDs. I suspect there's a lot more to come.",1173484800,3,820,5.051851851851852
1614252,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've been using the secret before I knew it was the secret. I usually don't write reviews but I felt a real need to do it this time. I was very impressed with the Secret. It starts off a little corny and gimmicky. But if you watch and pay close attention you  begin to understand the message. The message is not a message of greed as some people have said and it is not a message of positive visualization as others have said. The message is that you can attract positive things in your life by acting in a positive manner and expressing positivity in all things you believe, say, and do. If you act negative, express negativity and doubt, and believe negativity all things that follow you will be negative and the worse you feel about each negative thing the more your life can spiral out in to a negative place. This is not a scheme to get rich, a shortcut, or a New Age solution. This is a way of belief, thought and deed that will move your life in a more positive direction. The thoughts that lead our society now are thoughts of lack, debt, power, revenge, depression, struggle, and anger. This can help you start to rearrange those thoughts and actions to a more positive model. This is not an end all solution by any means but it can point you in the right direction. I'm sharing the Secret with all the people in my life that I think may benefit from it. I hope you who read this will get a copy or find the information elsewhere and spread it as well. It is a great intro to the truth about how the universe works.",1173398400,,1524,4.255172413793104

1614254,4,B00005JPJ8,"Before to talk about the DVD I want to tell you that this is not my language, therefore I could make some mistakes and I hope you understand.  Thanks.

I really like this DVD and I think is a positive way to think.  It doesn't matter which religion we belong, this talks only about the law of attraction in all the matters of our life.  We are what we think about us, sometimes we don't have the exactly mirror we want to look at, sometimes we just don't have a mirror to look at us or maybe we do have our great mirror.  I think this DVD makes think a lil bit more about ourselves and know how much we can get from the universe, not only about things, because this could be seen only in its materilistic side, we need to pay attention in the whole DVD and practice to practice in all the aspects of  our whole life.  Everybody has the law of attractions experiences every day,positives or negatives,  we just don't realize about  them sometimes, and if we do, maybe we need some push to start to work better about growing our inner self.  Therefore I think this DVD could help us to remember we can get everything we really want in all the aspects of our lifes.  I decided to watch it often to help me to remember to focus in what I really want.  I give 4 stars because I think they could focus a little bit more in other areas than the material areas.

I have personal experience with several of the participant teachers (it would be a mistake to call them actors) In 1992, I borrowed $5000. to spend a week with a powerful group of these same teachers and am happy to say it was one of the best things I have ever done with my time.

Oh yes... did it make me a millionaire? Several times over, but more importantly I have never enjoyed life and living more than now. Try it with an open mind and act upon the wisdom and you will be ""knowing"" in a ffew years that this was the start of something big, VERY BIG!",1173398400,6,943,4.209944751381215

If the persons with negative reviews of the material were to do that they'd probably reconsider.  I'm aware some haven't even seen it so give it a test drive.  You might be enlightened.  It's not a ""cult thing"" it's just a different way of perceiving.  Kind of like ""counting to 10"" when you get really angry with someone or something (an example to get my point across).

I get really frustrated reading the other reviews and comments of people who are incredibly skeptical about it but like they say, people do not like others who are more successful then them and try to criticize them.

1) the Lightbulb will go off in your mind and you'll 'know' that you've known this all along, but you're happy that you now recognize it, and you make a conscious decision to practice what you've learned.

2) You didn't know this, never imagined that you were in control of your life but it all makes SO much sense now, and your life if forever changed because you now feel empowered.

3) You think it's all bull.

For me, it was #1. I've always been aware of the law of attraction, and yes there have been many other books devoted to this subject, it is nothing new. But sometimes, there is one book or in this case one DVD that sparks something extra...this DVD did it for me and many other people that I know. Watching it often, to remind yourself of the law is essential. This is not a DVD you watch once and then put away to gather dust. This is a lesson that must be ingrained into your mind to keep the 'old' way of thinkin/living/creating your life by default from sneaking back.

Those who react in the third way to this movie, the ones who think it's all bull, will be obvious to observe. Once you recognize the Law, your eyes see so much more. The people who believe they don't create their lives consciously stick out like sore thumbs.",1173398400,8,1305,4.310204081632653

I discarded the negative reviews telling myself that these people must have closed minds or have lead jaded lives, and then I saw the DVD.

Luckily a friend of a friend let me borrow it.  The DVD isn't bad.  I would say that it is worth watching, but I wouldn't buy it, and if I had, I would be mad!  It is definitely a self-help DVD with a bunch of affirmations, self-talk, mind over matter, positive thinking, etc.  The stuff we all know and don't practice near enough. This is a combination of basic psychology, the power of faith, influential speakers, and good (or better yet, phenomenal) marketing.

While there were some inspiring and thought provoking words of wisdom from the speakers at times, the entire concept was a little hard to swallow. The only reason it got two stars from me is that I do believe in the power of thought and it doesn't hurt to be reminded of it every now and then. I personally believe that our thoughts do have great influence in our lives, but not sufficient to control everything in our lives as the dvd suggests.  (I guess the guy on the DVD really wanted to walk again and Christopher Reeve just didn't want it enough).

Some of this movie was plain silly, and seemed made for pre-teens!  The opening sequence to ""uncover the secret"" and the genie made me think I was watching a segment of Buffy The Vampire Slayer or Charmed.  The constant ""whispering"" was a little eerie and annonying to me.  Also, I was taken back by the lady staring in the window at the jewelry case, the kid wanting the bike,  and they guy visualizing himself in his dream car.  While I don't think that there's anything wrong with wanting material things in life, I really expected more intelligence and substance.

After watching it, I felt like I just left a motivational seminar or something, except for the silly dramatizations.  I couldn't help but make fun of them.

That's the (unintentional!) message of this movie. You will get if you are able to look behind the wishful-thinking smokescreen, the thinly-veiled consumerism, and the callous disregard for *anybody* whose fate happens not to be a member of the upper-class First World.

Yeah, the law of attraction really works. Unfortunately there's two crucial steps missing between ""want it"" and ""get it"", which are ""work for it"" and ""don't be in a situation where there's no way in hell of getting it"".

The real world is full of examples that this is true. Everybody ultimately dies -- and people routinely get killed for lots of reasons, all of them bad. This movie ultimately tries to tell me that, yeah, it probably was the Jews' own damn fault that they got gassed in Germany. (Just to pick the most extreme example in recent history -- there are plenty others.)

Sorry, but I refuse to let my brains fall out.

1614334,1,B00005JPJ8,"While there is SOME good information in this movie (positive thinking..) there are a few things that it missed entirely. The way that the ""secret"" is presented is materialistic and narcissistic. Nowhere in this movie was the concept of responsibility ever touched on. It definitely needs a ""be careful what you wish for"" disclaimer and at least a couple minutes of discussion regarding the fact that the more you learn, experience and the more you open up to profound spiritual energy - things don't get EASIER. They get HARDER. Life is complex and anything offering the ""answers"" to all your ""problems"" is a charlatan and obviously doesn't know what they are talking about. We need to be held accountable for what we manifest and take responsibility for the way our lives turn out.

Another thing - I absolutely am appalled by anyone who markets the concept that someone is ill because they aren't able to manifest health. Sometimes, things happen for a reason and we may not always understand why they are happening to us but it's offensive and unbelievably narcissistic to think that someone has cancer or whatever, simply because they either ""want to be sick"" or because they aren't thinking the right things to manifest health. If you want to read a great book about this, read Ken Wilber's ""Grace & Grit"".

If your focus and thoughts are positve, your life will improve and if your focus and thoughts are negative, your life will get worse.  I truly believe that.  I have seen it work both ways in my life.  It is the same as a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Also, focusing on gratitude in all situations is powerful.  Parts of the DVD are very motivating and inspirational, but there were some things that bothered me:

1)  We cannot forget the sovereign will of God.  While we all have been given free will to change our lives, there are some things (good and bad) that are out of our control and we may never understand why they occur.  We have to trust God in those situations. The DVD focuses on the ""universe"" rather than God.  God is the creator of the universe.

2)  There was too much focus on material gains.  I would love to have seen more on how to attain positive relationships, personal development and less anxiety, rather than a new car or necklace.

3)  I must agree with some of the other reviewers that the beginning and the genie were kind of strange.  They were a turn-off to me.

I would love to see a version made for Christians!!  A book I recommend for Christians is ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"" (revised edition) by Joseph Murphy.",1173312000,9,1298,4.47008547008547
1614374,2,B00005JPJ8,"While I basically agree with what a lot of the one star reviews say (with regard to its marketing and its misrepresentation as a secret, particularly), I think that if someone feels drawn to buy The Secret, they should. After all, the paths to the Mountain are myriad and, for some, The Secret represents a trail head. I remember when I first became aware of being on The Path at an early age, I read a lot of books that wouldn't much interest me today. I think the same may be true for many, years after reading The Secret.

My main caution with The Secret (I watched the DVD and browsed the book), is that The Secret gets the so-called 'law' of attraction wrong. Mick, Keith and the boys got it right 40-some years ago when they sang, ""You can't always get what you want, but if you try, sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.""

In my experience, what we draw to ourselves is what we need to further our own evolution toward real and abiding happiness (which only comes with a visceral understanding of our oneness with 'God'). This doesn't always correspond to what we wish. That which we draw to ourselves are lessons, not wishes.

I note that the DVD of The Secret extensively uses the image of the Universe as a genie which endlessly grants your wishes (if you only would visualize and feel what you want properly). But this is a cartoon image of the traditional folklore of the Djinn. Many of the tales of the Djinn were cautionary tales along the lines of ""be careful what you wish for."" Wishes are like that. Because we live in a consumerist culture, we are conditioned from early on to believe that it's money, cars, houses, etc. that will make us happy. But the wealthiest among us --I know quite a few-- are not. It is like Jesus said, ""It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to pass into the kingdom of heaven.""

My hope is that those who feel drawn to read The Secret or view the DVD will not find disappointment when everything they wish for doesn't come true and make them happy and turn away from some of the very valid lessons it presents. My sincerest hope is that it functions for what it is - a trail head to a deeper pursuit of truth.",1173312000,6,2213,4.325301204819277

1614411,4,B00005JPJ8,"I had been using the law of attraction in my life for about a year before I heard about this book (a friend recommended it to me right before it was on Oprah). I can tell you that the principles do exist and they do work. This is not a new concept, actually, but it explains it in a way that people might understand better. (One quick example: Wayne Dyer says: ""You create your thoughts. Your thoughts create your intentions, and your intentions create your reality."") This is just Eastern philosophy, or what some all New Age, packaged a little differently this time.

The disappointment I have with the DVD is the emphasis on acquiring material things. The guy who gets ""checks in the mail"" fails to explain that he got more checks in the mail because he no doubt attracted more clients. The law of attraction brings you an idea, a person, or an opportunity, which you then act on, which then produces income for you. A semi doesn't show up in front of your house filled with $20 bills. I'm glad Jack Canfield explained how he acquired his wealth. It was through having a clear final outcome he wanted, then attracting the right IDEAS, which he then acted on. This is how it manifested for me: find your bliss and be totally grateful for your current circumstances, put what you want out there, believe wholeheartedly that the universe will bring you what you it is that you want, and get ready to receive. I'm in the arts, and I've had amazing creative experiences using this method. They are also right when they say that when you are lined up with the future you want for yourself, the entire experience is effortless. People and circumstances you need to get to your end result appear. It really does happen just the way Jack Canfield described. Embrace what's coming your way and trust that it's going to take you where you want to go.

I do think people who are always broke will understand from the DVD that prosperity is a mindset. You first have to believe that you deserve it. This was a big wake up call to me. I had developed an unhealthy relationship with money. Over the years, I had started to believe that if you have money, you have attachments to material things, which I definitely have worked hard to rid myself of. I realize now that I don't have to turn into a person whose life revolves around material things just because I have monetary abundance.

They do talk briefly at the end of the DVD about money not being the key to happiness - that you have to find happiness on the inside. And James Arthur Ray DOES talk about the importance of following up with action (by the way, this is really what has been known as karmic action for thousands of years). However, these points are barely touched upon.

Another thing that bothers me is in the very beginning of the DVD, where they say something like: What do you really want? What kind of house do you want to live in? Do you want more success? They don't even touch on things that really matter, like harmonious relationships and world peace and to have a career that makes you feel fulfilled. They touch on these thing later, but I guess my question is, ""Do they think the only way to grab Americans' attention is by talking about the greedy aspect?"" Lots of us aren't focused on that at all and would have been excited to see those other things in the ""hook.""

I do wish they would have explained more about specific methods for getting to that necessary state of joy and bliss. A lot of people have pain they carry around with them. You attract good things when you truly feel good. I was surprised they don't talk about the importance of meditation, only because in the book it says how important it is. I am in a state of bliss 95% of the time. To get to this state, I used methods in a book called The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. (By the way, I lived in a state of debilitating depression for many years. The methods in The Power of Now really work.) It was a gradual process, but he gives you some fantastic tools. I highly recommend it. If you are a person who spends a lot of time thinking about the past or wishing it had gone differently or people would have acted differently, this will provide you with the tools you need to get rid of all of that. At least it worked - with miraculous results - for me. I am one of the people they refer to in The Secret DVD, where they say, ""People will ask you, 'I want what you have. What do you do differently from what I do?'"" People ask me that all the time.

I understand that it's hard to swallow that we bring about our own reality. Especially when you look at rape victims, etc. However, I AM a rape victim and I can tell you that at the time that it happened, my life was in turmoil and I felt very strongly that I had no control over what was happening to me in my life. (What I realize now is that I do have control: I have control over my perspective and my reaction to what happens to me.) If like attracts like, it is quite possible I attracted it into my life. I also felt at the time that I was being victimized in other areas of my life. (I am in NO WAY excusing the person who did this to me. I am also not telling you that being raped was ""my fault."" But I am telling you that I can definitely see how I might have attracted the circumstance during that time in my life.) What I'm saying is that people don't create a tragic reality by thinking and feeling, ""Wow! I really hope I am attacked, taken advantage of, or that someone smashes the window of my car next week."" What happens is that the person thinks prolonged thoughts of, ""I am always a victim,"" or ""No one can be trusted"" or ""Other people control my life"" or ""Bad things always happen to me."" Sometimes this collectively happens within a group of people as well. Surely we have all known a person who is pertually angry at the world. Doesn't it seem like that person can never cut a break? That they are always getting screwed over or people always want to fight with them?

Even with the areas I describe above that I wish would have been handled differently on the DVD, I am still giving The Secret 4 stars, because I know from personal experience that the law of attraction works.",1173312000,6,6192,4.319002579535684

This movie proves that you have to make maintaining a positive attitude in life unconditional.  While many other authors have presented this point, like Dale Carnegie for example, ""The Secret"" simplifies the explanation.

I am an intellectual but I still see the benefit of this DVD.  To hate it because it is not as sophisticated as other sources, or your preferred source, is to show that your understanding of the concepts therein are flawed.

""The Secret"" does not claim to have invented the concepts, they are simply being dramatic for the simple reason that too many people still haven't gotten it.  So maybe it is time for a simple version like this.

You have to admit that the more intellectual a text, the more difficult it is to reach people.

1614444,3,B00005JPJ8,"This is an edited review - my new rating is one star.

I am reviewing this again because I'm feel much more objective now.

Whilst I agreed last time with all that was said in the DVD, but that getting the principles to work was difficult, I've come to understand that in actual fact, the principles as delivered are completely false. There are shades of truth, and certainly thinking positive is to be commended and encouraged, but saying that whatever you want will be attracted to you, every time, is just nonsense!

I just walked away from an online program made by one of the presenters in The Secret because I finally woke up. The teachings are misleading and even dangerous. For example, the concept of curing cancer through thought. I wonder how many cancer sufferers out there are convinced they'll get better if they say ""Thank you for my healing"" all day long.

If you really want something similar but actually worthwhile, you may be better off getting Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. This book won't tell you the universe will deliver whatever you want without any work, rather that through persistence, perseverance and burning desire you can achieve what you want. The Secret contains magical thinking, Think & Grow Rich does not - it contains common sense.

I look forward to seeing more people wake up to what The Secret really is: just a money making exercise for its makers, and a cruel, misleading and irresponsible one at that.",1173139200,6,1452,4.723320158102767
1614445,5,B00005JPJ8,"I would say that this DVD has taken the very essence of personal development, be it in relationships, health or career, and managed to condense it into a very entertaining and even intellectually stimulating presentation.

The premise of The Secret is pretty much that everything in your current life as it is has been manifested by you; both events and things you deem as good or bad. By virtue of the thoughts, emotions and even 'micro actions' you adhere to chronically every day. (see The Science of Getting Rich - by Wallace D. Wattles).

Nay sayers to this paradigm may say that unfortunate people do not manifest hurricanes, or earthquakes or accidents. Or that no amount of 'positive thinking' will enable you to jump off a cliff and not hit the floor.

True...perhaps.

However, the arguments to and for this concept boil down to a simple question: Would you rather live your life resignedly as a victim of circumstance, or pro actively *choose* to see everything in your now as part of your creation; and thus something that can be undone and changed if necessary?

If I were to pick the winners in life, I would say they mostly live with the latter mindset.

One final note: although it's a great dvd, some religious folks may feel unsettled by the fact that it moves circumstantial responsibility from a deity 'out there' and places it right on your lap. If you can get over that little hurdle, you should enjoy the dvd ;-).",1173139200,17,1436,4.678571428571429
1614446,4,B00005JPJ8,"The people who hate on this movie completely miss the point.  In fairness though, Ms. Byrne does over-simplify the laws of attraction while bringing a hefty dose of hype.  If you browse this website I'll bet you'll find 50 books that explain the same principle.  More thorough and, in my opinion, better explanations are found by Wayne Dyer (""Power of Intentions,"" ""Real Magic,"" and ""Manifest Your Destiny""), Esther Hicks, Wattles, ""The Science of Getting Rich,"" ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", and Iyanla Van Zant just to name a few.  In fact, I'm taking a business leadership course that states the same thing. They all essentially say that thoughts are the predecessors to actions and you create your own world through your thoughts and attitudes.  (For example, does anyone know of a drama queen who sees everything as a slight?  She is creating her own world and pain).

I think the problem some people are having is the way this message is presented.  Ms. Byrne is very clever in recognizing that the U.S in particular is completely driven by its love of entertainment.  (Ms. Byrne being a TV producer knows how to make you tune in!!).  She correctly understands that 80% of America does not read books and will not watch anything that does not involve a sleekly produced action or mystery.  But guess what America, this is the condition we created and you can't fault someone for using it to succeed.  The fact that many people watch this and think it's something new or from the Devil proves that exact point.  It is neither.  Nor is it an invitation to sit on your behind and just wish for things.  It lets you know that you are the creator of your reality and any success in life begins with the belief that all is possible and that attainment will come.  That is what motivates people to action and to look for opportunities. Truly, the only limitations you have are in your mind.

If there is only one thing you take away from this movie, please let it be your resolve to express gratitude for your current circumstances and what you already have.  This alone will create major improvements in your life.  I am living proof of that.",1173139200,45,2142,4.63395225464191

Anyone who says the power of positive thinking is not possible in the real world; has not tried it on a regular basis.

1614448,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is such a wonderful age to be living in. This DVD summarizes in a clear presentation what I have learned over many years of studying. It is the underlying message in many of today's books, and as noted in the movie, the secret was known and made available to us by many throughout history, with names provided and the suggestion to further study them. Even the advice given to get it working for you is simple and easy to follow. To those who will declare it will not work, lol, well of course if that is what you believe, then it will not work for you. It is that simple. Application is the only verification I have found to work for this principle. We apply it whether we are choosing to believe or disbelieve.

Given the principles in how the Secret works, if someone had a bad experience in light of learning to use this gift, as is suggested in a previous post, then someone needs to readjust what they focus their thoughts on.

For those that are familiar with the law of attraction this movie isn't going to teach you something you don't already know. If you know the basics of it, it might teach you a new way to explain it.

The reason I watched it was because a few of my clients had watched it, they had gotten very different things from it. Some of them started becoming fearful while others thought it was a blessing. I ended up writing an article and posting it entitled: Is ""The Secret"" and the introduction to law of attraction a fear breeder or a blessing to people? Most of my clients have now read it and utilized what they have learned to overcome the fear they initially felt.

I personally liked the movie and have had some family members watch it as well, they have all learned something from watching it. There is much focus on materialistic things and they are used as a reference, even though there are people in the movie who talk about emotional wealth as well. It seems as if it is a movie for those who have never heard of law of attraction and for that group the movie is brilliant. I think it is setup in a nice way and uses ""showmanship"" very well. It has been marketed nicely and has received quite a bit of hype, but when you are selling something, that is a key. Be it Oprah, Dr. Phil, Tony Robbins, Donald Trump etc... They all do a great job of hyping up what they do and present the information in different ways designed to catch people's attention.

Overall, if you have never heard of the law of attraction then it is a good movie to watch, if you are willing to watch it with an open mind. There are many other sources out there that may speak more the ""language"" you want to be spoken to in. As a life coach I would recommend this movie to clients, because I know they can make sure how to utilize the information to their benefit. My only concern about this movie is that people will think that this movie is telling them to sit on the couch and just wish for things. When the movie is encouraging you to think outside of the box, to keep a positive attitude and to strive for the things you want. That you can do anything you want, but it all starts in your mind.

What if you learn one new thing from this movie, will it be worth it? What if you can utilize it to make a positive change in your life is it worth it? For me, a book has been worth reading, if I can utilize one thing from it.

After reading the reviews on here there was a quote that I remembered, just found it interesting because everyone will have a different opinion on this movie, just like everything else.

""We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us.""

1614472,5,B00005JPJ8,"I am utterly disgusted by some of the reviews I have read on this page, esp. the one that is entitled "" Satan is doing Cartwheels'. This is a sick, sick person/reviewer.  This DVD is so potent and lifechanging ( AND NON-DENOMINATIONAL) that for some religious nut to insult it so easily after the message of hope and empowerment it instills-it is downright disgusting.
I don't care who you are or what you do. Whether you work a 9 to 5 that you hate, or are the most successful person on earth. This DVD will teach you how to shift your chain of thought and put you in control of your life.
It will show you how thoughts ( or as people from my spirituality call it, 'postulates', or intentions) rule our lives and if you have a plethera of negative ones, you will attract negative things.
The DVD mentions the oddity that we have in the world, where the sick are the ones who speak so frequently of illness and the healthy virtually never obsess over it; like so many things, those who focus on the not desirable end up unintentionally causing it to take over their lives.
How I heard about this The Secret is when I went to a costume fitting for a shoot a few weeks ago and I had to wait for someone in the waiting area. I began chating with the girl that greeted the actors and took our measurements. As she was taking mine, I told her my stats and sort of joked about how overweight I am. This kind woman began to tell me about how she weighed the same amount as I did but was shorter. I couldn't believe her, as she looked tiny! SHe then told me how fantastic I looked, and how amazing I was. I was shocked! And she truly meant what she was saying! I told her how amazing she looked ( it was true) and she said ' I know. I have accepted that I look fantastic' and she said this in the most kind, honest way, not in an egotistical sense.
What she said stuck with me, and my husband and I watched The Secret to see what had inspired her.
You know, people seem to for some reason want to shift the blame onto other people, and believe that they are not in control of their lives. When I attended Catholic school as a kid, we were told that god was in control of our destinies; no one ever mentioned that WE were the shaper of our lives. If someone questioned this, they were told sternly that 'god has a plan for everyone'.
Think again. 'God' or life or infinity is a part of us. We are 'god', or part of the power that some deify and give that name. Our thoughts control our lives, and if we don't start living with a positive attitude, we will not succeed at all.
Buy this DVD right now, and then USE IT. Don't be scared off by people in your church or clique that tell you not to watch it because it is 'the work of satan' or some psychotic thing like that. THESE ARE EXACTLY THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT YOU TO SUCCEED!
I believe that everyone is great. Not that they can be, but they ARE RIGHT NOW. This DVD helped me realize that.
NOTE: I just read a 'message' from someone who responded to this review, and as I knew would happen, they attacked  it.
What inspired me about the costume woman is how she believed in herself, and how she accepted who she was as being great. Many woman ( if not all) and men question the way the look talk, act. We all do. I work in a very mean industry, where there is a set standard of how we should look and act. I would like to say it hasn't affected me in the past, but is has. And when one takes the careeer path of an actor or artist, one is frequently told they are not good enough and won't succeed.
This DVD helps me to accept my potential and the potential of others. I am no longer going to focus on the negative facets of my life and self and refuse to take personally any insults I may get ( here or elsewhere)!
So, if anyone wants to 'challege' my review, that's fine! I am not going to waste my time debating what you think is right and what the DVD says, or what my opinion is. But, I wanted to put a little blurb here ( on my actual review) to expand on why I was attracted to The Secret.

It consists of a bunch of empty slogans spoken in soothing voices by a bunch of sincere, smiling ""experts"" (philosophers, a metaphysician, a ""visionary"").  These are all spliced together with fictional scenes in a way that makes the whole thing seem kind of disjointed and manic.  These scenes are simplistic and laughable - a giant genie offering to fulfill your every wish, a man in Roman times copying some text (the ""secret,"" we are to presume) and then being chased through a tunnel, a woman seeing a necklace she likes receives it as a gift after visualizing it.

The ""Secret"" insults my intelligence.  I'm blessed with the ability to reason and think critically, and I know that when something promises to be the ""secret"" to EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED, it's too good to be true.

Think positively and work towards your goals,  but don't think that the universe is going to provide you with all of your petty little material wants simply because you really really want them.

If you don't like the word ""universe"", substitute it with God.  If you are Christian, as I am, can you not see the teachings of Jesus in this message? ""Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.""

The way I understand it from the teachings of Esther and Jerry Hicks is that we live in a vibrational universe (""God is spirit"") and we are vibrational beings (spirit...an extension, ""a child"" of God).  Every thought, word, or deed we send out has a vibration. Because of the universal law of like attracts like or energy always returns to itself, we attract back to ourselves what we put out.  I suppose that is why God only ""forgives us"", for example, to the degree that we ""forgive"" others.  What we send out rebounds back to us exactly.

The kingdom of God is within you.  And in God, we live and move and have our being. What does this mean?  We are in God and God is within us. (Is it not written ""ye are all Gods""?)  Tap into the universe (God) through faithful prayer, be joyful and grateful each moment that you can, faithfully believe God will answer your requests, treat others as you want to be treated, and watch your life change.",1172966400,35,1380,4.368627450980392

It is New Age self-help at it's very worst and tries to convince us that we are God.  Their so-called ""Religious Expert"" is a leader in the church of New Thought, which is a little-known cult in the New Age Movement. Does any follower of Christ have any business messing around with ""The Secret""?

""And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.  I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.""  Ecclesiastes 1:13-14",1172966400,19,945,4.4393063583815024

Napolean Hill wrote about back in the 30's - Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford and Thomas Edison practiced what we now call ""The Secret"".  Only they didn't call it a secret - they considered it as a way to achieve what they wanted.  Truly, the people who get so angry over The Secret are people who are hurt over how badly things have gone in their lives.  They are in pain - that's where anger comes from.  I loved The Secret - I've been using these principals for years.  Here's the common sense part:  Decide what you want, make a list (goals), and make it happen!  That's it.  Nothing mystical or mysterious.  If you aren't making a list of your goals, then how will you reach them?

Where is the work that you need to do to get these things besides just thinking about them. What about learning from the past so you do not make the same mistakes again.

I had a serious concern with a couple of the authors ""experts"" who I can only describe as ""oily""... such as the ""doctor of metaphysics"" (first name rhythms with 'slow') and the other (another word for back doctor?).

Oh, and that ""Doctor of Metaphysics"", well, looks like the ""doctorate degree"" came in the mail.  Sorry folks, the ""Doctor"" is a fraud! (Unless anyone can point to a fully accredited metaphysical university...)  Getting an advanced degree from a papermill and then preaching like you are a mental health professional is, I believe, illegal and dangerous!

I am amazed at how stuff like this can be repackaged, and the masses suck it up like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The concept of attraction has been around since eternity and has been espoused by the self-help gurus for decades. This book is nothing new. Hats off to the author, though, she will be (probably already is) a very, very rich person!

As an update- check out the upcoming March 5 Newsweek cover story on this book (view now on the Newsweek website). It supports this review and all the others that point out this book is just regurgitated positive thinking trivia, albiet perfectly marketed as espousing a ""secret"" that was just discovered by the author. Funny, even the author lets us all in on ""her"" little secret, she found an old self-help book on the shelf, written in 1910, dusted it off and retooled it with all the technological wizardry of the 21st century, got Oprah to give it not one, but two endorsements (really, to be fair, Oprah endorses the concept of the law of attraction) and PRESTO, you end up with the hottest selling self-help book of the new century.

Newsweek (and the 2/27 Today show) does a great job in punching holes throughout this ""self-help"" book. In fact, it comes pretty close to debunking and exposing this circus barker from down-under.

Just this weekend, I saw a steady stream of lonely hearts approach the Borders saleperson begging for a copy of this sold-out panacea.

I first read about the subconscious mind only hearing the ""I wants"" instead of the ""I don't wants"" about 40 years ago when I read my dad's copy of Maxwell Maltz's Psycho-Cybernetics.

The beginning and section breaks were hokey. The whispering was silly. But I liked many of the quotes that were whispered. This isn't an infomercial. Some of the additional features do come off as a mild sales pitch. You can buy more of their stuff if you want it but you don't need to because I think you get enough of ""how to"" in the DVD.

If The Secret were so clear and the movie unnecessary why is the world in the condition it's in? Why have war, poverty, hunger, etc. not been banished?

This movie is a wonderful introduction for most people and it's a fantastic reminder for the rest of us.

1614531,5,B00005JPJ8,"Some people might tell you that the breakout movie The Secret isn't revealing anything they haven't already learned, that these concepts have been around for a long time. And, of course, they are correct. There were authors in the early 1900s teaching this secret in books such as The Edinburgh Lectures On Mental Science by Thomas Troward (1900) and The Science Of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles (1910), which is the book that inspired The Secret.

Even more recently, if you read Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting by Lynn Grabhorn in 2003, or Ask And It Is Given by Jerry and Esther Hicks in 2004, or The Power Of Intention by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer in 2005, then, again, you are familiar with the universal Law of Attraction (a.k.a. the secret). Yet, regardless of the fact that this information has been available to us for a hundred years or more, no one thus far has explained the Law of Attraction so simply, straightforwardly and eloquently as this popular movie. And everyone will benefit from reviewing these principles over and over again.

So whether or not you are new to the idea that we can change our lives by monitoring our thoughts and feelings, I cannot give a higher recommendation to The Secret. I personally prefer the movie (DVD) to the book due to its visual presentation of the subject matter, the fascinating real-life examples they've used as evidence that the secret works, and the fictional stories they created to drive home their points. But get yourself whatever format you prefer as soon as possible, and begin to use the principles taught to attract whatever you want to be, do or have in life--that is, whatever you ""believe"" you can be, do or have.

One observation I made when talking to people who have seen this movie is that once people have seen this film, they find themselves feeling excited about life's potential and grateful for being alive during this amazing time in history when these rarely used concepts are becoming conscious to the masses. I can't wait to see the changes that will take place as more and more people grasp these ideas and utilize them. I plan to be one of those people, which is why I've watched The Secret three times already and plan to watch it many more.

1614534,1,B00005JPJ8,"A friend of mine was watching Opera and they were talking about ""the Secret"" is a book by Rhonda Byrne. She convinced me to read it. It basically teaches people to think positive and good things will happen. My problem with the book is two things. First it tries to teach that thought waves are projected out into the universe and attract similar thoughts (explained by Quantum Physics??) But the second teaching is the one that makes my go hum.... They explain the process it all in a way that, if good things don't happen to you, is because you don't ""believe they will"".

How destructive this could be... There is a psychological/sociological concept called ""blaming the victim"" in which we blame the very individual who has been hurt. This is the process used by an abuser (""If you behaved the way I want you to, I wouldn't have to hurt you!""), and it destroys confidence, self-esteem, hope...The medical profession has its own version...There is some belief that we are the cause of our own illnesses. (Most especially, cancer). What a horrible burden to place on someone if they become ill! Likewise, if you wish for something to happen (without a true understanding of what, in life, you can control and cannot) and it doesn't come about (winning the lottery, for example), then the blame falls on you...(""Well, you just didn't believe enough!"") Can you see what the implications of this nonsense are? They have an answer for everything. They talked about the people who die in war and how it was because they had the ""thought"" of war that drew them to their death. I can even begin to say how much damage this will cause. These are the basic RADICAL principles of people who do not believe in medicine and there child dies because of a simple cold, they blame the child for not ""believing enough"".",1172707200,78,1805,4.676100628930818

It sounds like science, but it ain't. Not even close. It's just clever BS, period.  In fact, the pseudo-scientific babblings of the principals of this production do nothing more than to demonstrate either (1) their misinterpretation and absolute ignorance about basic physical principles such as energy, matter, vibrations, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, or (2) unmitigated greed.  This concept is nothing more than a repackaged version of praying for what you want -- only in this scenario, you don't have to believe in a god that responds to supplication (prayer).

There is nothing wrong with thinking positively (in fact, it is essential) -- but it's even more important to think those thoughts in reality. Deep enough!",1172620800,71,1295,5.297560975609756
1614541,3,B00005JPJ8,"With all the hype about The Secret, I was eager to find out what everyone was talking about.  I bought both the DVD and the CD set and watched with great anticipation.

Perhaps because I have studied and utilized for over 2 decades some of the most powerful mindset tools, processes and technologies for creating what you want, my expectations may have been skewed compared to those who have never heard of or applied such concepts as the law of attraction.

That is not to say the DVD/CD does not have value.  I am sure there are people whose lives have been changed by it.  I think they did an outstanding marketing job.  An outstanding ""packaging"" job in creating The Secret.  The attraction  principles do work, and they provided a great introduction to those who have not been exposed to them before.

For me personally, my first disappointment was the fact that what was dramatically (and cleverly) built up as ""a secret"" - which to me something you know that I don't - was hardly a secret.  These principles have been around for centuries, have been mainstream for decades, with thousands of books, seminars, etc. covering the same principles.  I don't appreciate books, tapes, etc. that overpromise and under deliver.  So, to me, hardly a secret.

My second disappointment was the lack of depth around the subject matter. If you want more in-dpeth and leading edge info about how our thoughts create our reality, invest in the DVD ""What the Bleep?""  It offers fascinating leading edge quantum physics principles, along with great animation explaining in simple layman terms, why and how we create our realities.  In fact, some of the scientists on The Secret *first* appeared in ""What the Bleep?""  I almost felt when I was watching The Secret, that they copied ""What the Bleep?"" in many respects, although at a more superficial level.

My third disappointment/concern is how some Secret followers will interpret the messagge in the movie.  Again my perspective may be slightly skewed because I trained in and work with NLP (Neurolinguistic Programmming) which works drectly with the subconscious mind for helping people create accelerated breakthroughs in their lives.  The suggestions, recommmended processes, etc. in The Secret work primarily with the conscious mind.  Yet it is our subconscious mind that drives 80% of our behaviors and outcomes in life.

Yes, if you practice their recommendations for months and months, the  suggestions may eventually sink into our subconscious.  However there are simpler, quicker ways to create what you want.  The other piece of that, because the subconscious mind does drive our results, there are many blocks -- such as ""secondary gains"" for staying stuck, values conflicts, limited beliefs, etc. - below our conscious awareness that stops us from having what we want.  Because the movie does not address the difference between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind, and treats the whole topic superficially as why some people manifest and some don't, it creates the illusion that as long as you practice their suggestions, you will change your life.  There is so much more than what is presented as to what are the differences that make the difference to creating what you want.

While I am glad that so many people are becoming more aware of these principles, I am concerned about the fallout as well.  I am hearing people do potentially harmful things like go into deeper debt, making dramatic life changes with blind faith, because the DVD tells them they can have what they want if they just believe, etc.

I would suggest if you buy the DVD to take a few things that most resonated with you, and apply them to your life, as long as you don't sacrifice or overhaul other areas of your life without looking at the big picture.  Sort out the glitz from the message.  Also check what is not true for you and let go of it.

I would recommend the movie ""what the bleep?""  It goes hand in hand with The Secret, although more in depth and was the original movie that brought these concepts mainstream.

Third, I recommend that you check out book on NLP (as well as hypnosis which is a sister discipline).  Out of all the mindset tools and technologies I have used in over 20 years, I have found they are by far the most powerful.  One of the best ""beginner"" books is:  ""NLP: The New Technology of Achievement"".

I was a little skeptical but thought what the heck, after I watched the DVD, I could pass it on to my friend if I didn't want to watch it again.

Well, I couldn't even get through the whole DVD. The message of the power of positive thinking is a good one, a great one, that many people need. I'm already pretty optimistic so I don't need that lesson - certainly not candy-coated by bizarre re-enactments and lesser known ""scientists"" suggesting that we can get a necklace or a car or a parking spot just by thinking about it. It *SO MUCH* reminded me of a multi-level marketing meeting for NuSkin that I was invited to years ago...tempting people with jewelry, cars, etc., appealing to the materialistic needs of the masses.

I wondered what was wrong with me, why did I dislike a highly rated video so much? Well, first, I realize that most people with a healthy dose of skepticism or a scientific background wouldn't even order this DVD in the first place. Then, today I saw Newsweek's straightforward review that echoed my sentiments so well...I realized I'm not alone in thinking that this whole concept is kind of ridiculous!

So...if it works for you, that's great. Like religion or a support group, some people just need a little something extra to pick them up and keep them going, to give them hope for a more prosperous future. But this is definitely not for me.",1172534400,16,1599,4.487972508591065
1614546,2,B00005JPJ8,"There is a kernel of a wonderful idea in ""The Secret"" that is, unfortunately, presented in this book and DVD merely as candy-coated, imaginary thinking that perfectly suits American tastes. It is interesting that producer Rhonda Byrne is Australian, and yet she chose twenty-four Americans to serve as teachers of ""The Secret."" The ""teachers"" are most notable for their impeccable marketing credentials rather than logical heirs to the intellectual tradition of luminaries such as Shakespeare, Da Vinci, Newton, Emerson, or Jesus, all of whom are referenced as historical bearers of ""The Secret.""

Fortunately, there are teachers who tap the same vein as ""The Secret"" but provide more substance and depth. Great faith traditions are one place to look, but if you are interested in a more secular and specific course, I would like to point you toward ""Napoleon Hill's Keys to Success: The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement."" Napoleon Hill's work was recommended by Donald Mitchell in his Amazon review of ""The Secret,"" so I can say that I learned something as a result of ""The Secret"" that I wouldn't have known otherwise (thanks to Mitchell, that is; as far as I can tell, Napoleon Hill is not referenced in ""The Secret"" itself).

What is lacking in ""The Secret"" can be found in Hill's ""Philosophy of Achievement."" Hill talks about having a positive mental attitude and visualizing one's goals, in addition to a burning desire to reach a definite purpose, the will to do the hard work needed to get there, and the ethic of working in service of others, among other qualities. A far cry from ""The Secret"" telling readers that ""The only thing you need to do is feel good now.""",1172534400,17,1678,4.925795053003534
1614547,4,B00005JPJ8,"Many who have watched The Secret say that it really isn't a

""secret"" what is conveyed in the movie. Conversely when we look at the state of society and the way that many of us in America and other countries live their lives when there is a vast abundance of resources available to improve the quality of our existence, then one must concur that The Secret really is a secret otherwise people would make different choices to bring about different results. There is room for much debate around this film i.e. what about the bad things that happen in the world, but instead of debating I choose to focus on what feels good about the movie. This moves into a collective conciousness of sorts.

I began watching The Secret last fall before it became mainstream.

It was during a particularly challenging time in my life that I heard about it and was drawn to it. Most people have challenging times in their lives so I'm no exception. However it seemed like this season of my life was lasting waaaaay too long especially considering I was working so hard to have a really good life.

After viewing The Secret I realized there really is an elevator ride through life. It first begins with a thought, then a feeling, then taking inspired action. This is what sacred texts such as The Bible are really all about. This was the missing key in my faith walk.

I highly recommend grabbing a copy of The Secret as an entry point to understanding the significance that thoughts, feelings and actions play into shaping our lives into one that we truly deserve.

No matter what religion, faith or thought process you ascribe to, or believe, you will glean valuable wisdom from The Secret.

Keep an open mind and open heart and feel good!

I am somewhat amazed by many of the reviews that I have read here. For the life of me I cannot find anything negative about The Secret at all.

I started applying the power of positive thinking to my life this morning in acknowledging the things that I am grateful for. As I searched my heart and soul for all that I am grateful for I realized that I am truly blessed.

At this point I have no desire to ask for anything materialistic but I have no doubt that anything that I do choose to ask for will be received.

My interest in The Secret really has nothing to do with outward gain, as there is much more needed inwardly. This realization alone has improved my life already - imagine the potential..................",1172534400,14,916,4.3391812865497075

The Secret is nothing more than a regurgitated version of concepts from ""In Tune With the Infinite"" and ""The Science of the Mind"".

It is about harnessing creative visualization to achieve your earthy goals from personal happiness to business.

There is a catch however. When forcing Ether to get something, which is not karmic ally deserved, usually there is a backlash. This backlash is coming from disturbing the nature of things. I am sure everyone has heard of the woman who intently focused on getting a Mink coat and when finally she got it her, husband got transferred to Egypt.

It is useful to creatively visualize things that are beneficial for others and not for petty selfish gains. It is always wise to ad to our meditative session ""I want this and that if it is agreeable with my karma"".

The techniques outlined in this book are powerful and can be called ""white magic"" or sorcery. Once upon the time one could get into serious trouble from the religious authorities for practic-ing or even talking about subjects such as this. Nowadays the only danger is that we might actually get what we asked for.",1172534400,12,1318,4.71304347826087

This video presents diverse perspectives on that same Secret - as one person said, ""it gets you to notice it.""  I have found that regularly watching the video on my iPod when I travel or have down time helps remind me of the principles and concepts behind it, and helps me stay focused.

Are all the people on the video perfect?  No.  Do any of them have the complete answer?  Maybe, but not on the video.  Can this tool help the visual and kinesthetic learner gain insight as well as enthusiasm about the subject?  Absolutely, that's what it did for me.

1614604,4,B00005JPJ8,"Every generation has to rediscover essential truths for themselves. It takes a lot of savvy marketing to get a message through to today's generation accustomed to getting information in soundbites and unable to remain focused on anything long enough to really understand it. 'The Secret' has piqued our attention, and kept it, by promising that all the baubles that we lust after(cars, homes, bling) are ours for the attracting.  There may be nothing new here, other than emerging support from the field of quantum physics, but 'The Secret' speaks to us in a vocabulary of materialism that, unfortunately, we are too well versed in. To that end it succeeds. However it is all about individual choice-you get to choose what you wish to attract in your life.

We are what we think and feel - if we were not, there would be no placebo effect in medicine, stress and anxiety would not be behind much of the illness so pervasive in our society, we would not experience good or bad 'vibes' from other people, and athletes would not 'waste time' visualizing victory. 'The Secret' is at work, whether you explicitly believe it or not. You can harness its power if you wish to start creating your own reality, your own life.  But, you have to believe in it for it to work. It will not work if you try to harm someone else, or try to 'control' them and get them to do something. Also, don't expect the BMW to simply drop out of the sky because you 'think and feel it'. The film took some short-cuts to visually convey this idea. The car may just show up(ie. you win a prize drawing for a BMW), you just happen to hear of one for sale at a great price from a friend, or you start doing the things you need to do to get you closer to your goal- for example, you might be inspired to start saving money, something you may not have done before. The universe works in mysterious ways - you don't get to decide how and when what you want  manifests, but it will not come, if you do not truly believe and feel that what you want to attract is possible for you. You have to be willing to receive and believe you are worthy. If we could just do this last thing, and learn to fully love and accept ourselves, we could attract anything we want into our lives. That's the real secret.",1172448000,23,2262,4.391408114558472
1614605,2,B00005JPJ8,"If this is your first introduction to The Law of Attraction and the concept of your perception creating your reality this infomertial style Ad made into a protracted movie may serve a purpose if only to inroduce you to mind creation concepts.

Normally I love this sort of material and eat it up!  I have no problem at all with the basic premise of this DVD (although there are some exaggerated applications presented).  However, I was bored, felt like I had been had (especially for $30) yet faithfully watched it to the end hoping it would get better and was dissapointed with its lack of depth and repetitive commercial format with made most late-night infomertials look good!  I took particular offense with its shallow ""Get-Rich-Quick"" scheme of offering the shallow hook of aquiring cars and wealth by a magical knowlege of ""the secret"" which has never been a secret at all!

You could easily watch it for 10 minutes only and skip the rest of this drawn out infomertial and not miss a thing.  Save yourself the money and simply consider the DVDs singular and repetitive soundbite theme introducting the law of attraction (the so called secret):  ""Decide what you want, be specific and put imagery and emotion into it several minutes a day, ask the universe for it, act as if it has already happened and live a live of gratitude, and your wishes will eventually manifest"".  There, now you don't need to watch the movie at all!!

Consider not wasting your money and instead purchasing other more in depth and thoughtful works available:  ""The Power of Your Subconsious Mind"", by Joseph Murphy, ""Living Deliberately"", by Harry Palmer, any Science of Mind writings by Ernest Holmes, ""Psycho-Cybernetics"", ""The Power of Positive Thinking"", ""Think and Grow Rich"", Tony Robbins Works, the Short And Sweet Booklets:  ""As a Man Thinketh"", by James Allen, ""The Abudance Book"", by John Randoph, ""The Mental Equivalent"" by Emmet Fox, etc, etc.

All the above are much much better than this oversold, overpriced albeit commercially successful and shallow DVD which mainly proves that there is great money in selling dreams and hope by reincarnating old concepts in a new accessable commercial format (so old it is new).

In summary, only recommended as an entry point for those totally new to Mind Creation concerpts.  Many who have dealt in depth along spiritual lines may find this infomertial called a movie a waste of money and time and may perhaps be repulsed by its shallow content and commercial format and style.

However, in all fairness, beneath this ""Secret"" DVDs' commertial presentation is a theme that obviously strikes a chord with many - and to them I strongly recommend reviewing the much better works referenced above 1st or borrowing or renting the ""Secret"" DVD rather than buying (unless time and money are in ample supply).",1172448000,7,2837,4.930672268907563

If it is, your DVD player is probably too complicated for you to be able to watch this anyway.

If you enjoy e-harmony, or ""get rich with no money down"" commercials, you will love the feel of this ""movie"".

If you are already on-purpose, of at least on the path, this will feel like pre school material.

Buy ""As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allen, or ""Creating Affluence"" by Deepak Chopra instead of this if you need a start. Then move on to Tony Robbins.

But then again the ""doctor"" in the film isn't a doctor either, so much as a man with a made-up degree in 'metaphysical science' from an institute he founded.

But who cares about the facts right lets get to the message I heard you can get free stuff out of it! Well, that's the basic premise, that if you think hard enough about what you want it will send out magical brain signals into the universe and the universe will have to send you what you ask for. I guess that explains why all these new age weirdos in the film are driving around in Aston Martins on their own private islands... oh wait, they're not?

But that's what the film says anyway. You think it and it comes true. If you want a unicorn farm on the rings of Saturn just keep thinking about it, it will come. But if you think negative thoughts than the opposite happens and you get bad things sent you. Those kids getting their limbs hacked off in Darfur are just ""Neagatve Nancy's."" And finally we have proof that rape vicitms had it coming!

This film and the people responsible for it are bottom-feeding trash. But they found a market: what lazy, greedy American doesn't want more free 'stuff' without actually having to do anything for it?

I have seen the makers of this movie talk on talk shows and they give much more information than is on this DVD.  I think you would need to take a thousand different scenarios and then ask them how to deal with them before you could apply this philosophy because it is very confusing.  Kind of like scientology is so confusing and needs intense instruction to learn, I believe this ""secret"" needs alot more information and instruction to apply it so that it works as it states it does.

Wanna be rich, get a bigger house, drive a spiffy car, want that soul mate?  Start with being grateful for what you do have.  Then think about what it is you want, visualize it, really feel it and the universe will at some point give it to you.

In my case I followed the Huna Philosophy, and one of the seven rules is energy flows where attention goes.  In the Bible, and teachings of Buddha the principle is also contained.  Mark 11.24  Whatsoever ye desire, believe that ye have it, and it is yours.  So, I watched this movie featuring the eminent teachers of the LOA, not expecting to add much to my store of knowledge.  Much to my surprise, I did learn a lot from this movie, and on that basis I highly recommend it.

Before watching this movie I knew that my thoughts created my reality.  The missing link for me was the importance of feelings.  When you feel good, good things tend to come to you, and when you feel bad, you attract bad things.  So, it is important to have better ways of looking at situations, and then you will attract better situations.  The other concept that impressed me was importance of gratitude.  Gratitude rocks.

If you wish to buy a good book on the subject, I recommend The law of Attraction by Michael Losier, and, Ask and it is Given by Esther and Jerry Hicks.  My favorite quote from the movie: 'What you think and feel, and what you manifest is always a match. Every single time.  No exception' Esther Hicks. My other favorite quote: 'Your wish is my command.' The Universe.

Something like this was a fad in the 80's, a large number of enthusiastic people became followers, just as you see now.  In the 80's the fad lasted a few years, people saw that it's effects were illusory, it lost converts, and the fad passed.

And now it's happening again, the same 'ol shuck and jive.  A new generation of converts enriching the crooked authors, and once again, the fad will pass.

This DVD leads one entirely to selfish delusions.  It absolutely amazes me that people are so gullible to buy into the nonesense.  Just because a theory has been around a long time doesn't necessarily mean it's true.  The philosphy of war has been around since the dawn of time, war is an ancient philosophy, a horrible one.

The main problem with the philosophy in this DVD is that it has no understanding of duality.  The light of ""positive thought"" is a false light that casts a dark shadow.  Positive thought is eternally bound to negative thought.  By fosusing on the positive you are indulging in an illusion that  will bring you a temporary high.  The trick of duality is that by focusing on the positive, you are actually increasing your bond to the negative, your bond to duality.

Freedom, the freedom spoken about across history, comes from the detachment from thought, detachment from duality, detachment from the positive and the negative.  Only then can you see the transcendent light, a light that has no shadow, a light that cannot be touched by thought in any form (positive or negative), a light that cannot be touched by self will.

The teachings in the DVD only lead to delusions, selfish delusions.",1172016000,26,1869,4.712962962962963

A whole new way of thinking has been opened up to me after viewing this, first online, and then finally when I bought the DVD!  It's not a religion, or a cult...it's simply learning how to shift your way of viewing your life and from there, taking the steps to bring into your life exactly what you want!

I view the DVD whenever I feel I'm veering off the path, or whenever I'm beginning to feel frustrated at the point I'm at in my life. It's not an every day viewing. It's whenever I need that swift kick and pick me up! Bad habits are hard to break at times and I AM human, so once in a while, I need to watch this and when I'm done, I'm right back on the right path again!

I've been on this planet for almost 43 years now and something so simple and basic such as the message in this DVD is what it's taken me to finally know ""the secret"" to my very own happiness! I may not be completely there yet, but one thing's for certain...I'm on my way!!! I believe this to be true in my whole heart and soul!",1172016000,13,1070,3.9906542056074765

The last several years I had gotten away from the secret but fortunately and not through coincidence it has come back to me.  The secret has been used and written about from many different people from all walks of life dating back thousands of years. For example, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Joseph Murphy, and Wayne Dyer speak of principles that is called the secret. I do not consider it a fad otherwise it's principles wouldn't have survived time.  Plus it is not positive mental attitude, it is affirmative reality. I've read enough books, listened to tapes, etc... to know the difference, plus you didn't get ""IT"" if that's all you got out of it. You actually have to make an effort for this to work for you and not give up when it gets difficult.

The truth is that the new age philosophy propagated in this book is just a foreign bird with a local walk, and a selfish one at that. People who are attracted to this are looking to have their spiritual cake and eat their fleshly desires as well. And lets see what the ultimate outcome of such a position is:
In India some years ago there was a horrific train crash in which many people died including some Christian missionaries. As they were lying there dying, some of the villagers came up to the train and started stealing their necklaces and purses and running away laughing! When this became public knowlege, many were outraged at these people's barbaric insensitivity, but do you know what their response was? ""It must have been their karma that made the train crash, those missionaries must have been bad people in another life so they deserved to be treated in such a way!!!""
What does that have to do with this book and DVD you ask? Well, how about the fact that ultimately The Secret derives it's world view from monistic pantheism which does not and cannot distinguish between good and evil. Evil is called ""Maya"" or illusion and if one would only change their mind about the nature of bad or evil things, they would cease to be real!
Of course, anyone can see how this leads to wickedness in itself because true compassion is thrown right out the window ie. ""dont think about fat people or you may become fat yourself! (paraphrase mine)""
Instead, why not ground your self in Truth and not on the shifting sands of subjective morality and spirituality. The Secret is nothing more than a path to personal frusteration, disappointment and finally destruction.",1171929600,22,1942,4.551428571428572

1614697,2,B00005JPJ8,"I'm editing my Amazon review of this movie.  The review I'd posted here several years ago no longer reflects my opinion.

The movie ""The Secret"" is all about the ""law of attraction"".  If you're looking for a great resource on the typical ""law of attraction"" (LOA) belief, this is probably the gold standard.  It explains the information as well as anything in the marketplace and you'll come away with a very clear understanding of the basic concept.  The production value is top-notch.  The writing is clear.  And, overall, it's a positive message.

The problem, however, is that the message is TOO positive....to the point of being completely misleading.

For instance, the movie proposes that it is a ""law"" that you can simply focus on what you want, and you will get it.

That sounds good and looks good....the only problem is that it's absurd.  People do not get what they want by simply visualizing and meditating on it.  People get what they want by focusing on something and then taking persistent ACTION toward getting it...and simultaneously increasing one's skill in a particular area so that the outcome is more likely.

""The Secret"" ignores most of this formula and admonishes that ""you can be, do or have anything you want in life"".  It's a wonderful statement of human potential....but it says nothing about the need to actually apply effort, take action or to improve oneself in a particular area to get a result.

Not only does this incomplete formula lead most people to frustration and failure, I believe it's also dangerous to one's mental health.  Quite simply, telling a quadriplegic that they can be an NBA superstar simply by ""focusing on it"" creates a situation in which -- not only is he let down when he doesn't achieve it -- but is likely to blame himself that he ""didn't apply the law of attraction well enough"".

How many widows of cancer patients are feeling guilty about their spouse's death because they believed the over-simplified message in this movie and thought it was their fault because they ""gave too much energy to negative thinking""?

Those are not extreme examples and the point is simple: an incomplete formula creates frustration....and can also produce self-blame for that lack of result.

For the record, I'm not speaking from personal frustration.  This was not my experience.  I applied focus and clarity to my goals....acquired the skills....and put forth the action and went from broke to wealthy in less than a few years.  At the time, I gave a lot of credit to the ""law of attraction"" because I didn't really stop to notice all the things I was doing that were NOT part of ""The Secret"" formula.

CONCLUSION:  The movie is fun and entertaining.  But it is NOT an explanation for how life actually works.  And I believe that its intentional omission of ""action"" and ""applied effort"" and ""acquiring skills"" gives the viewer a skewed perspective about what's really needed in order to create huge results in one's life.",1171929600,10,2969,4.852882703777336

Life is not about ""test driving the car you want"" so you can ""manifest"" it. It's not about the ""2 million dollar house,"" the spouse that is to ""die for,"" or all the fabulous vacations you get to have.

If all that that were to disapear tommorow and you were sitting in a field with a hut you had constructed out of cardboard could you still find the essential joy in your heart, could you still feel the pulse of the universe, could you be overcome by awe for the beauty of the world that surrounds you.

These are exciting times and let us now begin to focus on the Solutions instead of the problems of the world because what we allow our minds to focus on expands.  If we focus on the Solutions and are grateful for the positive things in life and in the world, these things will continue to grow and multiply.  War only creates more war.  If we live in Peace, it will only create more peace!  Because LIKE attracts LIKE things!

1614731,2,B00005JPJ8,"This started out pretty cool.  The production values and 'story' were intriguing.  The Australian accent of the woman actress was predictable - sales Pyschology says that Americans love, trust, and are more likely to buy from anyone that has British/Aussie accent.  That's why every guy selling things at a home fair has a real or fake British accent.  It was all downhill when the people (most of dubious expertise) were cut in to the film and started talking - and talking - and saying the same thing to the point of out and out redundancy.  But I really listened to what they were saying, attempting to remain neutral.  That's when they whipped out the genie, who was alleged to represent God.  It highlighted quotes from the great minds of history - one of whom was Jesus, who was lumped in with Michelangelo and other inventors/artists.  What??  DON'T use scripture to manipulate people into thinking that Christ was in cahoots with these allegedly uber-enlightened, new age 'experts' who wish most to attract your hard-earned money into their pockets.  The most offensive part of this movie is that this is no secret.  From a biblical standpoint, a believer (in Christ) can ask anything of God, and if it's God's will for your life, you WILL receive it.  In fact, the Bible also states, ""You have not because you ask not.""  Don't forget to ask!  Now, from the standpoint of brain research, the so-called magic 'Law of Attraction' is really a function of the reticular activing system in the brain.  When it works (and for most of us, it does), it allows us to focus.  It's how and why when we set a goal, work hard, and hyperfocus on something like graduating from college, getting the girl/guy, paying off a large amount of debt, all else that does not contribute to that goal falls off the radar.  We complete that goal because we have focused on it.  Similarly, challenges with the reticular activating system manifest themselves in issues like ADD, and the inability to focus. So, if you want to be successful, focus, work hard, and pray.  Things don't work out?  Pray, get back up, dust yourself, work hard, and focus.  Things still don't work out?  Maybe your plan 'just wasn't your bus (or 'God's Will' for your life)'.  If you're searching for help with having the life you want, find it in the best-selling book ever - the Bible.  It's an amazing book, full of encouragement and wisdom.  Need human help?  Lou Tice at the Pacific Institute (who was my first teacher of the principals referred to here as the Law of Attraction - and an extraorinarily classy, world-renowned, and highly respected man), Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer, and Beth Moore can offer encouragement and hope.

1614732,5,B00005JPJ8,"I have to admit that I've read just about every self-help and law of attraction book out there.  This video puts ALL of them to shame.  Actually, I shouldn't say that because each book has it's own revelations to make people's lives better.

The Secret, though, has EVERYTHING you need in order to manifest ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you want in your life.  It's a one-stop shop to getting all of the knowledge that it would take many books, perhaps hundreds, to get all of this information across.

The biggest (and hardest) piece of information to swallow (and digest) is that the life you have now is something YOU have created by all of your past thoughts and feelings.

The best part of that revelation is that you do have the power to completely change your life in EVERY WAY.  It's exciting to know that you do have this power because the alternative is thinking that everyone and everything else controls your experiences in life.

Isn't it exciting to know that YOU control your experiences in life?  You may answer ""no"" if your life isn't good.  You should answer ""yes"" because you CAN make your life into ANYTHING you want it to be at any time, STARTING RIGHT NOW!

I highly, highly, highly recommend this video to everyone.  In fact, if I could recommend only 1 book, video, course, audio set on any subject, it would have to be this one above everything else.

This video gives you a specific STEP-BY-STEP plan on manifesting your desires in life then goes into great detail about each step.  There is nothing like it out there ANYWHERE!

I wish I would have watched this as a child, then again as a teenager, then again in my 20s...and frequently thereafter.  My life would be completely different.

Then again, it doesn't matter.  I've been using The Secret for about 1 year now and there has been some incredible changes!  I'm ready to up the ante again and do a complete remodel on my entire life and, within 12 months, I will be doing even much better than I am today.

Just to give you an idea:  I lost 2 huge multi-million dollar companies to several major lawsuits, including one from the government.  I wallowed in pity for at least 2 years before I watched this video.  I was broke, still going through the lawsuits, and lost all hope.  I lost 2 million-dollar homes, 4 luxury cars, and 1/2 million dollars CASH in the bank.  It was like a quick tornado that took everything almost instantly.

I realized I created it all because I didn't want to be in my business anymore.  I wanted something different.  I had been broke and struggling for the first 2 years after losing my companies.

Since watching The Secret and implementing the strategies, I've been able to pull myself slowly out of the ""mud"" and get my life back together.  The lawsuits disappeared.  We ended up settling with the government.  I went from having no income and no idea what I wanted to do with my life to making about $100,000 in the past 12 months.  Yes, that was a drastic cut in pay from my company days but much better than the previous 2 years where I made $0 the first of the two years and about $20,000 of the second of those two years.

I'm still trying to find what I really want to do rather than jumping into starting another company that I won't like running but there have been several income streams that have come from nowhere which has given me the option of figuring out what I want to do while making a great income.

I've watched this video about 6 times.  It's really addicting.  Each time I get something new from it.  This last time I watched it I took extensive notes on my laptop.  I didn't want to miss one droplet of important information.

Everyone needs to watch this.  Most people won't because they are skeptical or would rather live a life of misery and lack.  And that's fine for them.

And for all the skeptics or those who say that ""this stuff doesn't work,"" don't buy this video.  You've already made up your mind that this isn't for you.  Keep living your miserable life as it is while the rest of us completely change our lives with The Secret.

Remember, the choice is always yours.  And you can choose something different for your life today, starting with getting this video.

1614733,2,B00005JPJ8,"Generally, an offensive, hard-sell presentation of potentially useful information. Positive thinking and gratitude are good and healthful practices, but the so-called secret encourages readers/viewers to identify with consumerism and overindulgence as if that is the focal point of life to which we should all aspire when such practice, in reality, can only lead to further disatisfaction when more is not enough- and, truth be told, it never is. For a practice with lasting rewards, read ""God Without Religion"", which offers techniques for freedom from dependance on false securities along with a philosphy of self that is inclusive of all humanity.",1171843200,16,650,5.51
1614734,5,B00005JPJ8,"I just got this movie and watched it. I am a Christian and I have NO problem at all with watching it and do not believe the negative comments that other people are saying. Just so people know where I am coming from, I should say that I am the type of Christian who does NOT believe in the fire and brimstone ideas that certain Christian religions believe in. I believe God wants us to have good things in life. With that said, I believe there are a couple passages in the Bible that affirm what the movie tells us. For example in Matthew Chapter 7, verses 7-8, it says ""Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who askes receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened."" And in Matthew Chapter 21, verses 18-22, it talks about a fig tree that has withered. And in 21-22, it says ""Jesus replied, I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but you also can say to the this mountain, Go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."" Well, this last sentence is very much in line with the steps listed in the movie. In the movie it says to ask for what you want, believe as though you are going to get it, and then receive it. With this said, I don't necessarily believe things are magically going to happen for you overnight, or that they will happen exactly as you want. For example, in the movie it mentioned that the man who wrote ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" wanted $100,000 in the first year. He didn't get exactly that amount that first year as he wanted, but he did come close to it. So, I do feel he did have success. I do think if you practice what the movie says, you can achieve what you want in life or come very close to what you want through strength, motivation, and determination. Also, I feel that being positive and the positive thinking that the movie talks about is good for the soul. And if you are happy and it shows, your happy feelings will rub off on others and help to make the world somewhat better. Feeling positive and happy is better than being negative.

I also have to say that most of the concepts in the movie are things I have already learned before from self help books that I have read, but it doesn't hurt to hear them again. By hearing the concepts again and practicing them, this is how we can get better. After all, practice makes perfect. For example, the movie mentions that you should think about what you DO want and NOT what you don't want(I have read this before). This is because you will get whatever it is you are thinking about, even if it's something you don't want. The one idea in the movie that I had never heard of before that I thought was good, was to cut out a picture of what you want and place it somewhere so that you will see it frequently, so that you are motivated to have it one day for real. Such was the example where one person had a ""vision board"", where he cut out pictures from magazines, etc. of things he wanted to have and placed them on a poster board or something similar. This served as his motivation and he was able to obtain the house he had seen, which he cut out and was on his vision board. Another idea the movie presents that I also feel is true is that you have to pretend you are experiencing the final result of what it is that you want, such as wanting to overcome a health issue. I also liked the portions of the movie where they had quotes from successful people in the past. My favorite one was from Heny Ford who said ""Whether you think you can or can't, you're right.""

Anyway, I recommend getting this movie and forget what the nay sayers have to say. It doesn't hurt to at least try and watch the movie.",1171843200,29,3831,4.1617250673854445

Those who are fortunate to live in countries with thousands of opportunities around them will be helped by concentrating on what they want, rather than what they don't want, and this is not a secret.

If we believe what ""The Secret"" tells us, then children in African nations who are kidnapped and turned into child soldiers or sex slaves only have their own negative thoughts to blame.  Farmers in Bangladesh whose food and homes are destroyed in floods are creating this themselves.  I believe that this sort of thinking is sick and twisted.  It allows grotesquely rich individuals to say, 'I am rich thanks to my thinking - you have exactly the same opportunity as me, therefor I should feel no obligation to help those who are less well off'.

I also seems to say that because ""the universe will provide"", we can all have exactly what we want.  This seems shockingly short-sighted given the growing consensus that if we don't slow our consumption of the earth's resourses, there won't be a habitable earth in a few generations time.  So anyone who really wants it badly enough can have a $4M mansion.  Why is it that these people all seem to want more and bigger and better STUFF?

That's why I say this is about greed.

I brought my grandchildren up to believe in themselves and to think positive.

This is just the thing I needed to get myself back on track. Within 48 hours of renewing my faith in the power of positive thinking, my life started to change for the positive.

This is not a movie. It is not a documentary. This teaches you how to reach the things you want and how to attain it.

I am thankful for the kick in the backside to get me back to where I belong.

I recommend this to everyone.

My only complaint is that I ordered this dvd and it will not play in my dvd player. I got it to work on my computer. I purchased it directly from their site and I let them know that I'd like to replace this one.

1614759,5,B00005JPJ8,"As a serious student in both the spiritual and scientific explorations of our world, ""The Secret"" has informed me in ways so simplistic and obvious that I'm amazed I've missed it until now.  The Universe abundantly gives, and in that bountiful resource comes the sages and scientists, the guides and teachers,  the forerunners who keep announcing ""the truth"".

We are all 'one' - connected to everything that exists, creating everything that exists.  If we don't like what we have...then we'd better start dreaming anew.  ""The Secret"" shows us how!",1171670400,12,548,5.112359550561798
1614770,5,B00005JPJ8,"My wife and I have watched this movie documentary a few times ever since it came out several months ago, and we're so glad that it's having such an exposure on a massive scale. You could not ask for a bigger platform than 'Oprah' and 'Larry King Live' to talk about these principles. People are responding in a huge way because these are truths everybody 'knows' but just 'forgot.' That's why it's called 'The Secret,' even though it's a secret that's been staring us in the face all along. The Law of Attraction is a natural law just like the law of gravity or any other law of physics. What this movie does is just remind everyone that we can be more conscious and deliberate in using this law to our benefit, instead of meandering through life constantly bumping into things we have attracted unconsciously. This knowledge is very self-empowering and, as attested to by several participants in the Oprah show, can lead to dramatic life changes.

What you put your attention on grows. Focus on what you want, not on what you don't want. If you don't know what you want, make a list of things you don't want and then write down the exact opposite. Simple enough. But the tricky part is the allowing versus resisting. Focusing on what you want and feeling joyful/grateful about it, and focusing on what you want but feeling the absence or lack of it, are two different things. The former is an 'allowing' energy that will manifest what you want, while the latter is a 'resisting' energy that will manifest further lack. The nature and quality of the emotional energy is crucial. (For more details about how to navigate the Emotional Guidance System, I highly recommend the Abraham-Hicks material, e.g. 'The Law of Attraction' by Jerry and Esther Hicks.)

Now, when we say focus on what you want, that could be anything. While most people would put material wealth at the top of their list (which is perfectly fine, for the law does not judge), I like James Ray's definition of Harmonic Wealth, i.e., a person's true wealth is measured by how fulfilled they feel in these 5 areas of life: physical, financial, intellectual, relational and spiritual.

The difference is that a business dispute between the producers of this original and Jeremy and Esther Hicks led to a request to remove their discussions from this documentary and others replaced it.

This is an excellent documentary and I recommend either one as it reminds us that if we really believe in something passionately and pursue our dreams in the face of all obstacles or passion and convictions can lead to success in any realm of our lives.

I am giving 1 star because it is NOT an extended version and we owners of the original version are being misled and betrayed by the creators of this otherwise fantastic docuementary. Both the original version and this one and both are exactly the same length in minutes.  The difference is business disputes led to the removal of the Esther Hicks (Abraham) interviews from the original and other interviews were substituted in which was not explained until I wrote to the producers trying to understand what the difference was.  (I felt that extended should be like ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" (1.5 hours) vs. ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" Ultra-Extended Edition (FIVE HOURS!) and I expected additional length with this too.)

Both the original and this altered (not extended) edition of ""The Secret"" are EXCELLENT.  Both discuss the power of your thoughts, your dreams and where you focus your attention. Anyone who has pursued any passion feverishly to success through all obstacles by truly believing in their passion whether in a career, a hobby, or sport has already used ""the secret"".  If you find what you are passionate about in life, and focus your attention to manifest it you are on your way to creating the life you dream of.  Again, this rating is ONLY to send a message to the producers about honesty.  Otherwise, the content is so good that I watch this DVD over and over!  Why? Because it really embeds fundamental truths about life and how to live it successfully and shapes behavior toward more productive thinking that leads to greater success and joy in any area of life you put your attention on.

I've heard New Agers rant endlessly about the Powers of Intention and never believed it for a minute.  This program explains the process very well, though. Whatever you want, you do not just have to imagine it, but you have to feel your desires. This puts you on the appropriate vibrational level in order to attract what you need in order to manifest them. And then you have to act on your desires which takes a leap of faith.  The explanations here are believable and transforming.  If you're feeling stuck or helpless I recommend this DVD.

1614778,5,B00005JPJ8,"This is an excellent movie because, as one other reviewer mentioned, it has easy visual aids and simple ideas to which people can relate.  Though, it is nothing new, it is the first time you can watch it and hear.  How many millions of people never read self help books?  How many people who do, can't really understand how it works?  Those who think it is garbage don't believe in miracles and have no faith. Just the negativity of their comments is enough to make you sick to your stomach.

I for one have created several really great things after watching the movie.  I didn't start out with a 4 million dollar mansion because I wasn't ready to believe that . . . yet.  I was able to believe I could have a flexible job and still make the same kind of money.  I asked for it and within 2 days I was transferred into a new position created specially for me at the same company with much more flexibility.  Imagine that!

One morning, while in meditation, I ordered a handsome man with beautiful teeth to dance with that night. He would be well dressed, tall and very well built.  I knew I would recognize him immediately because when I turned around he would already be looking at me and smiling.  I had a wonderful time dancing with him that evening.  I didn't order the man of my dreams to marry and live happily every after because to begin with, I didn't want to make my order too complicated.  I was just learning.  Baby steps.

As for health, you're right.  No one would order cancer on purpose!!!  But I do know someone who was given 3 months to live with bone cancer and she decided to live and has no cancer.  That was years ago.  The doctors couldn't believe it.  Anyway, if you are looking for a way to better your life and you are willing to take responsibility, this is for you.

1614799,1,B00005JPJ8,"One of the main points of this very repetitive video is this: ""Your thoughts cause your feelings"". This is nothing new. It's one of the basic ideas of cognitive behavioral therapy. There's nothing magical about it. What this movie does is add a magical touch to it, and say that you can magically attract health and material posessions by your thoughts. It claims that it will happen every single time, including curing fata illnesses. Obviously if I wish I had a $4.5 million dollar mansion - like one of the guys in the movie says he has - won't just make it happen, or if I get cancer, I won't be able to magically heal myself. These teachings are like the prosperity gospel and will inevitably make people feel bad because they don't get everything they wish for and they think it must be their own fault because they've done something wrong.

Positive thinking does make you feel better, but the teachings of this movie are pure pseudoscience. The movie even claims that all terminal illness are caused by stress.

1614800,5,B00005JPJ8,"I was quite pleased with the presentation of the Secret. I found it to offer legitimate explanations as to why some get stuck in a ""rut"" and others sail through life with what seems to be virtual ease. You learn quickly there is nothing ""easy"" about it and for those who don't see the simplicity of it seem to think that it's presenting the ""granting of wishes"" when in fact it is not. Nor is does it claim any get rich quick ideologies which some mistakenly presume from watching (I think due to the clips they show between discussions which IMO is to relate to the lay person in simpler terms, or on a simpler less physic level how to achieve your goals/dreams). I believe it to be a presentation of factual universal law which is supplied to the viewer as a tool to use in whichever way you desire. In addition to the clips they give examples of ways you can use the information and create your own ""tools"" of sorts that guide you on your journey through life (we can relate their examples of a gratitude stone or collage of goals etc to what we may compare with our ""new years resolutions""- which most of us don't stick to, but the idea is hold yourself accountable by using some method). I found the DVD to confirm for me the way I have chosen to live the last few years (differnt from how I lived prior)- I make lists, whether short term ""new years resolutions"" or longer term life goals/life list and find that when I put my wants/needs/desires in my own face on a regular basis- I hold myself accountable. It's hard to do that when you just say something and don't have to account for it to yourself and let it fall by the wayside. Even if your skeptical, keep an open mind and if nothing else maybe there will be something said that you will see in the DVD, or hear that will help you make a better life for youself. After all, no matter our opinions on things we all want happiness, health, and a comfortable, fulfilled life and that all takes work no matter how it's taught to us.

Every true religion should be helping people find the truth within themselves that is empowering and will provide the assistance needed to live in this world.  One reviewer wrote regarding the video that the bible was quoted, ""God made man in his image"".  I for one have always pondered the deeper, real meaning of this quote.  And I have come to the same conclusion as mentioned in the video that we are the gods!  Is that blasphemy?  No.  It's empowering.  Because we can produce the same good as the God some believe in.  Shouldn't we want to do this in our lifetime?

Lastly, the comment made that you have to believe in the ""Secret"" or the ""Law of Attraction"" to get results is not exactly true.  Because the Law is working in all life rather we choose to consciously accept (thus, direct it and have our prayers answered) or unconsciously (thus getting more of the same e.g. what we don't want).  I've studied and still am learning that the Law does not discriminate and it will obey the people who have learn to master their minds.  It is energy of thought that gives energy to results.

Moreover, I have experience this Law in my own life and know I have because I have intentionally applied it and have gotten results.  Although, it's a discipline that must be practice and polished (I believe) daily.  ""Know thy self"".  Thank you!",1171497600,13,1449,4.575875486381323

It's all about fulfilling your every selfish desire.  Greed and gluttony are the keys to happiness. Now that the secret is out, I  wonder what will become of our society. Will we transform our world into a land of rainbows where rivers flow with chocolate and children in Iraq laugh and dance and play with gumdrop smiles?

Essentially, the movie features dozens of people reiterating over and over about how ""what you are thinking about becomes reinforced and determines what you will become"". Perhaps this is an astonishing idea, but it is a pretty basic psychology concept. This isn't to say that the idea doesn't have merit, because attempting to filter your thoughts - be optimistic - will affect your behavior and experiences, but the film was just too hokey and ridiculous. Everyone referred to this concept as ""The Secret"" and made it seem like the best thing ever. Maybe this would be interesting to you, but it was a bit too preachy for me, and seemed like it was made for people who easily conform and have no prior ideas about a concept like self-fulfilling prophesy.",1171411200,18,895,4.730769230769231
1614826,1,B00005JPJ8,"I was reluctant to buy this dvd in the first place because it sounded kind of cult-ish but i thought it did have a good message of thinking positively.  Well from the minute I started watching it I had this weird feeling like I was betraying God or something.  I kept watching and waiting for them to say something like God is who ultimately decides what happens in our lives, but it pretty much says the law of attraction rules all and we ARE God. It even refers to the bible saying we are made in Gods image, implying that we are God and we can make anything happen if we believe that.  Now I truly believe that positive thinking can heal and it definately brings good things, but this movie sends the message that I can believe something and poof it will appear.  I think it breaks at least two of the ten commandments--Thall shall not covet. and  Thall shall put no God before Me.  It even uses the word covet in the very beginning saying you can get what you covet.  I think that was when I really felt like i was a big sinner just from watching this.  To me this is just a big cult and if you do choose to watch it just remember that no matter what these philosophers say we are not the rulers of our world, God is.",1171411200,30,1221,4.1440677966101696

The ""secret"", while simplistic, is in fact something that most of us don't practice on a daily basis.  How many of us have a tendency to focus on the negative, which then, in return, brings more of the negative thing that we don't want.  It is a concept that gets you thinking and, if you're open-minded, it WILL change your life.  The ""secret"" will never work for those who don't believe.",1171411200,15,680,4.532786885245901

But I went into the Navy at 21 and from that point forward I sort of forgot all about ""The Secret"". To be in the military you are trained to not think as an individual but as a team (for valid reasons). So now I am 47 and what do you know...it all came back to me. There are many other sources that explain the various ways The Secret comes to be, but I enjoyed this DVD because you have several living examples of how The Secret is a success! I recommend watching this DVD if you want to put your life in order. If you are genuine in making a positive life change...you cannot fail. Seek other sources for more education, but this DVD is a good place to start and get prospective. Some have mentioned it's a waste of money...their opinion. I don't agree.

This DVD and the book both explain that if you dwell on the GOOD instead of the BAD you're going to attract that into your life!  This is real!  It works!  I""ve read several ""self-help"" books and motivational books.  The basic principles are in all of them, this DVD just takes them ""over-the-top"" with real people and real situations.  No, this won't work for everyone because everyone won't ""get it"".  And there will always be those few who ""get it"" more than others.  Give it a try.  REALLY give it a try.

This sentence was basically paraphrased over and over and over again throughout the ""documentary.""  This message really isn't a SECRET to anyone who has read a bit of literature or is familiar with any of many religions.  I was hoping for more of a scientific outlook (studies that have been proven, humans as beings of energy not matter, the laws of attraction), but sadly these things were only touched upon.  In fact, it seemed as if these concepts were merely mentioned to impress some folks?

However, I am glad I watched the presentation because being human, I need constant reminders to raise my thoughts and focus in order to continue shifting my reality. I had forgotten about the importance of ""feeling"" which the movie emphasized; if one says affirmations or state goals without ""feeling"" then the words have no power.

I find that this movie is a good contribution to raising awareness whether one's is an atheist, religious or on a spiritual path without religion. Its all about the awesome power we have within, of being connected to one another, and understanding we literally have a kingdom within.

I gave it a four star rating because of the over emphasis on material things... but give it a 5 star rating, for its added contribution in the field of spirituality and empowerment.

I do believe that the whole Davinci Code/Holy Grail type of introduction was overdone and the emphasis on materialistic things was somewhat unfortunate.  And I am sure some may take offense as to how they portray illnesses.  But hopefully if you are watching this DVD you are open-minded enough to overcome what I feel are the film's shortcomings.

Overall, though, the message is great and it does work.  Maybe not as dramatic as in the film, but once you start the practices ""The Secret"" discusses you will see a change in your life.

If you have done even a modicum of reading into spirtual self-help, I am sure you have come across the concepts depicted in ""The Secret"".  However, just as many professional certifications require continuing education; spiritual growth needs to be reinforced from time to time as well.",1171324800,18,949,4.89375
1614853,3,B00005JPJ8,"The good:  The message is a good one and can be inspirational for certain segments of the population.

The bad:  It will not easily convince those who require more rational and logical explanations for why ""the secret"" works (when it does).  The overly dramatic presentation made the whole thing seem comical.

The first thing I noticed was the over-the-top opening scene with famous historical figures using this ""secret"" to attain their successes and the power-hungry ones hoarding this ""secret"" away from the masses (this is in the clip shown by Amazon).  This set a tone for the movie (documentary?) that never allowed me to take it too seriously.  It continues on to interviews with ""experts"" who elaborate on the secret, which was interspersed with silly dramatized scenes of people using this secret to attain their goals.

The message given by these experts is that the universe is governed by the Law of Attraction - that what we think shapes the outcome of our lives.  This I don't have a problem with, except I would modify it to: ""What we think CAN shape the outcome of our lives.""  These experts are so eager to deliver their message that they seem to dismiss reality.  Just because I don't worry about not getting in an accident won't prevent one from happening (it will however, make the days leading up to the accident more pleasant and more productive).  Just because I want to be the greatest golfer in the world won't turn me into the next Tiger Woods.  Just because I want to cure cancer won't miraculously make me a scientist capable of doing so.  And so on and so forth.

There is a valuable message here however, one that doesn't rely on unrealistic promises.  Another way to talk about the Law of Attraction is to use the ""self-fulfilling prophesy"" idea from psychology.  When we think something is going to happen (good or bad), we act in ways that actually help make it happen.  It has nothing to do with brainwaves acting like magnets.  It is true that our attitude determines the quality of our lives, so having a positive outlook on life would increase the likelihood (not guarantee) that good things will result.  To have a more reasonable explanation for this can be found in the positive psychology movement.  ""Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life"" by Martin E. Seligman is a good place to start for people who want a more meaty, academic take on this ""phenomenon"".

The reason I give it 3 stars despite such a negative review is that to me, ""The Secret"" is like the ""magic"" feather in Dumbo.  The feather doesn't actually give Dumbo the ability to fly.  He always had the gift to do so.  What he lacked was the belief that he could and having the feather gave him the confidence to try.  If this DVD helps people have the confidence to let out their inner talents/skills to attain their goals and take more risks for the sake of their vision, then by all means, use it.",1171238400,88,2921,4.634241245136187
1614854,2,B00005JPJ8,"Like all pseudo-spiritual garbage, ""The Secret"" is a mixture of a little good and a ton of bad.  It contributes to the ongoing legacy of opportunistic ""new-agers"" who steal the mystical teachings of various religions and appropriate them to suit the materialistic mentality of the 21st century Westerner.  As always, instead of teaching humanity how to *comprehend* the sources of their desires and suffering - through meditation, reflection, or honest introspection - the makers of this video simply teach us a trick with which we can further bind and enslave ourselves to these sources (of desire and suffering).

Meanwhile, they are making quite a pretty penny for sharing such ""truths"".

I agree that gratitude, thankfulness and compassion are humane and beautiful things.  It is clear that thoughts are powerful generators of circumstances and events.  But that to be happy we must fulfill our every desire?  Damnation!  This contradicts the living teachings of every great Master humanity has ever known!

Buddha Shakyamuni: ""Desire is the root of all suffering.""

Krishnamurti: ""You will find this undying, unalterable happiness when you are liberated from the tyrannies of the self, its desires and longings.""

The Lord Krishna: ""When a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.""

Paramahansa Yogananda: ""When external objects of sense pleasure are destroyed, the happiness they give is destroyed with them.  But the ever new joy of God inherent in the soul is indestructible.""

Thomas a Kempis: ""Learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee.""

Samael Aun Weor: ""Analyze all human defects and you will see that they all have their foundation in desire.""

Jesus the Christ: ""Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.""

The ""Secret"" that God *wants* us to fulfill our every materialistic desire clearly contradicts the authentic religious teachings from every continent and every age.  It also flies in the face of a million real-life stories about the miserable rich, the drug-addicted celebrity, the unhappy millionaire, etc. etc. etc.

Either we continue to chase our own tails seeking happiness in the same old way or we start to look at this question in a totally new, intimate, and profoundly psychological light.

The prophets have spoken and so have the vipers of materialism.  Who do you trust more?

1614900,5,B00005JPJ8,"Have you ever thought about what the Secret means? It doesn't mean we've got a secret that no one knows and we all want to share it. The secret points to the common sense that we all know. It simply enforces basic principals that if followed will produce inner results; and that's where success starts. It doesn't guarantee riches it just states the obvious that if you believe you will be successful at rock farming, worm collecting, or finding potato chips in the shape of famous people ... Then you have a better chance of doing so if you truly believe you are capable.

I've spent a lifetime doubting my ability and self worth. I think most of us do that because we verbalize these thoughts in simple phrases that undermine our potential. Why do we do it? It's because many of us are truly afraid of trying then failing. So we create our own failure before any trying can occur. My mom used to say ""Don't say that. You speak it into your life when you do that."" I never realized it; but she was teaching a common sense basic principal that ""The Secret"" teaches. After discovering this DVD it helped me deal with my worst enemy on this planet ... No not Lex Luthor (lol) ... Myself. Some may ask why they didn't include more steps; you need to remember that the Journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step; and I applaud them for giving people the basic start because in this life we all need different road maps to make it to our destinations. Look at ""The Secret"" as the equivalent of someone gassing up your car, packing the luggage, and preparing your car for the journey that lay ahead.

Some people have been saying that this isn't really a secret so why call it ""The Secret""? People are reading too much into the title. It was meant to represent the answer to each individuals question. The title ""The Secret"" just means to imply the phrase ""The secret to (insert anything you wish to know the answer to ... Inner Peace, Happiness, Love, Self-Esteem) starts in your mind""

I also find it troubling that people have to bring the bible up when this is talked about. I'm a Christian and have always held the belief that GOD puts these type of things in our life to help us. If a person believes that GOD creates everything, why can't they believe that GOD worked through these people to help bring this common sense message to the masses? GOD gave us the ability to read, to listen, to learn. Do you really think he'd have a problem with people learning a lesson that doesn't require the bible being open in front of them?

This resistance, when it is present, is frequently operating at an unconscious level. I would like to have heard more discussion about strategies for overcoming inner resistance.

1614927,5,B00005JPJ8,"Well, yesterday I saw Oprah's story about The Secret and today I'm starting my exploration.  I live in Omaha and even in Omaha there is quite a buzz.  Seems to me this probably is old stuff but it sure is put together in such a way that I'm pumped and in the past month I've had 3 people (all strangers unconnected to each other) tell me that their lives were changed by the Secret.  So after the final push by Oprah, I went to New Realities and bought my secret key, secret treasure chest, and got a gratitude stone.  They have a web site too on Explore the Secret.

Some friends are talking about having a secret party . . . all about the law of attraction to create whatever you want.

The movie points out that people tend to focus their thoughts the negative (what they don't want or need) or they think about what they are already getting.  Instead, keep your thoughts focused on what you desire.

As a result of the movie, I'm trying to become immersed in this way of thinking, and this movie and the book are great starts.  Even if you aren't ready for ""immersion"" but you'd like to learn more about the law of attraction, I highly recommend this movie.",1170979200,12,1161,4.313364055299539
1614928,5,B00005JPJ8,"The ""buzz"" on this book has been phenomenal! That is noteworthy in and of itself. What is it about THIS that has grabbed people's attention now - and why? Are we particularly downhearted and in need of inspiration? And, if so, what makes this book and DVD stand out from the tons of self-help and inspirational books out there.

  Here's my take. While the book and DVD don't necessarily say anything that hasn't been said before it does:

1. Condense much of what people instinctively know and sense into understandable language. It reverberates with them because it simply makes sense and readers sense truth here.

2. There is solid info and research and personal examples to reveal that how we think affects not only the messages, verbal and nonverbal, we send to others but our actions. We have far more power over our life scripts than we think!

3. It goes beyond simple ""positive thinking"" to show, with personal examples from many people, how a change in attitude is just the beginning. Actions must follow.  Couples whose marriages had grown stagnant, others who'd lost hope...all were able to make remarkable changes in relatively short periods of time. They turned their lives around...and so can those who take heart from this book. It simply takes commitment and follow through.

  Don't read this with the assumption that you will find wealth, happiness and romance. Don't read it with a specific goal in mind -except that of being open to change. Keep your hopes and dreams in mind as you read this and you're likely to find personal and individualized inspiration.

  What I took away from this:  If you open your mind to the possibility of great change and revise your attitude, you may find yourself  amazed by how little changes can add up to a whole new life. Think positively, act positively and have the courage to take some risks.

On the other hand, I think the movie has good entertainment value and some very inspiring stories.  Overall I found it to be a positive experience, hence my rating of 4 stars.  For those who are completely new to metaphysics, this is probably a perfect introduction.  For one like myself, the hype obscures the value of the teaching presented.

This book follows a trend in recent books which express the innate power within us all to attract what we need in our lives; to manifest.  I had a wonderful teacher in recent months, the nationally popular clairvoyant medium Dr. Christian von Lahr of MystoftheOracle explain to me at a local Mind Body Spirit Expo how the workings of the consciousness energy helps us reach specific dimensions.  Christian explained at a high level how the spirit of our grandparents, great-grandparents, and those very many friends and family of our many past lives are all there in Soul, in Spirit with no other purpose then to shower blessings on us.  He conveyed we must learn how to connect, and it is the most natural of things.  He gave me the best psychic reading of my life and I have been living my dream.  This book explains the process in some more generalized, but easy to understand concepts, that we attract what we are in side, in our minds, in our hearts.  Christian has a book with coauthor Christopher Valentine, ""If You Could Only See .. A Gnome's Story"" which does a wonderful job of showing that there are spirits of nature who are real, and can help you attract what you want.  They explain so much of how Gnomes and Fairies are real, and have this purpose.  The Secret will bring you the results, and some of the amazing ways they actually come about are in this other book.  You can have what you want if you know the Secret(s).

1614958,3,B00005JPJ8,"Generally, and in my opinion, the overall message of the Secret (Extended) presents it's conclusion without the emphasis on doing. For example, the 3 Steps: Ask, Believe, Receive. A component of receiving, I believe, is not just sitting on your backside and waiting, but rather considering what else you can do to reach your goal and taking persistent action.

We do receive, or rather experience, what we focus on the most, and by focusing on a particular goal (material or spiritual) will help generate the momentum of thinking, feeling and most importantly DOING what we are inspired to do as a result.

None of the presenters in the secret received what they wanted without doing something in addition to Asking, Believing, and Receiving.

When they went on Larry King, they got paid and increased their wealth because they did something: wrote and sold a book or 50, created seminars, developed business plans, talked with other people in the ""game"" to understand how they did it, learned more through education, and etcetera.

While watching the DVD (a few times) it seems to me that it does imply the ""doing"" but it doesn't emphasise it. For reasons that are unclear the editors/producers chose to de-emphasise actions/doing in favour of a more ""magical"" cause-effect (ask and it shall be given).

(At the time of this writing) I work as a practicing psychotherapist and life skills counseller I don't think emphasising anything ""magical"" really helps people. However emphasising the development of a positive mental framework of thinking and feeling will encourage behaviour that when followed up with persistent actions will help us achieve our goals. Now that's something that people can use!

Also, you cannot ignore your environment and it seems The Secret doesn't even go there, which is unfortunate.

I generally enjoy the message of the DVD but in my opinion it falls well short of the mark in a few of the areas mentioned. Yet, at the same time, I don't feel pesimistic about the ""message"", I simply hope that most rational thinking people will not take the entire message ""as is"" but instead use their own brains to do some critical thinking.",1170720000,117,2159,4.96398891966759

Most people cannot begin to grasp the truth of Attraction because you are too relient on science (Only something that you can touch, prove and conceptualise.)

I am writing this because I believe that this DVD directly contradicts the teachings of the Christian Bible.  I am very concerned that many Christians may be misguided into believing that this film is beneficial to their lives, thereby moving further away from the teachings of Christ.

In order to illustrate the contradictions, I am taking quotes from the film and adding my comments as well as scripture (NIV Bible).  I can understand why this film is so appealing, but I am begging Christians to review the information within the film, and - as we are told by the Bible to do with all things - compare it to scripture.

The basic premise of this film is that you can alter the events of your life by focusing on what you want in a positive manner.  It sounds benign and beneficial.  That is absolutely untrue.  This is not benign.  It teaches New-Age Spirituality and can easily lead people astray.  God has severe warnings for people who do this.  There is a difference between thinking positively and believing your thoughts completely control your world.  You control how you perceive your world, not what happens in it.  God controls what happens in your world.

Isaiah 5

20 Woe to those who call evil good

  and good evil,

  who put darkness for light

  and light for darkness,

  who put bitter for sweet

  and sweet for bitter.

 21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes

  and clever in their own sight.

Quotes from ""The Secret""*

""Everything that is coming into your life you are attracting into your life based upon what you are thinking, the images in your mind.""

""It (the power) will sustain your very existence if you let it.""

One speaker, James Arthur Ray, describes God with the same words he uses for energy.  God is energy and nothing more according to this philosopher

""You are extensions of source energy.....  You are godforce, you are that which you call God.""

""You have god potential and power.""

""The power within you is greater than the power that is in the world.""

This is a direct reference to 1 John 4:4 that is referring to the Holy Spirit, not to us and our own abilities.  It is ironic that 1John 4 speaks to false teaching.

1 John 4

1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.

 4You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit[a] of truth and the spirit of falsehood.

""You are a magnificent creator.  You are here by your powerful and deliberate wanting to be here...."" (decide what you want and ) ""...focus on that, for it is by focusing on what you want that you will get it.""

Psalm  49

13 This is the fate of those who trust in themselves,

  and of their followers, who approve their sayings.

 14 Like sheep they are destined for the grave,

  and death will feed on them.

  The upright will rule over them in the morning;

  their forms will decay in the grave,

  far from their princely mansions.

 15 But God will redeem my life [f] from the grave;

  he will surely take me to himself.

""My primary aim was to feel and experience joy."" ...""if it ain't fun don't do it.""

""See yourself with the good that you desire, every religious book tells us that.""

Eccl 2

10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;

  I refused my heart no pleasure.

  My heart took delight in all my work,

  and this was the reward for all my labor.

 11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done

  and what I had toiled to achieve,

  everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;

  nothing was gained under the sun.

""You are the masterpiece of your own life, you are the Michelangelo of your own life.""

""There is no blackboard in the sky on which God has written your purpose, your mission in life.... Your purpose is what you say it is, and no one will stand in judgment of it, now or ever.""  Neale Donald Walsch, Author, ""Conversations with God""

Eph 2

10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

Mat 7

 21""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

God DOES have a plan for us, and it IS our job to determine that and then to follow it through.

This film literally describes the universe as a cosmic catalog, existing to do our bidding.  If you believe God exists, then believing the film's premise means you believe that God, the very Being that spoke the world into existence, lives to do our bidding.

I do not believe that.  I believe that I exist to do God's bidding and to be loved by Him.  I am to seek His will for my life and to act accordingly.  I am to ask God to put my desires into alignment with His desires, and then God will give me the desires of my heart.

Romans 8

28And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

2 Corinth 11:1-4

 1I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that. 2I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. 3But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 4For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.

*Regarding the Speakers:

Many of the speakers in this film are perceived as spiritual leaders.  The ""Chicken Soup"" author has books sold in many Christian bookstores, yet speaks of the universe as being directed not by God, but rather individual thought.  The ""Rev. Beckwith"" leads a church (Agape out of Los Angeles) that, when asked if it is Christian, answers ""No, and Yes.""  You cannot be both, and to deny Christ is a sin.  His teachings are by his own admission New Age.  Walsch, author of ""Conversations with God"" says that there is no judgment for your choices, but the Bible says otherwise.  There will be a day of judgment.  If not, there was no need for Christ to live or die.",1170547200,80,7020,4.325347758887172
1614965,3,B00005JPJ8,"A well put together, nicely presented version of the comparatively well-known Law of Attraction (they actually state so in the film quite early on).

If you are new to that 'law' or adhere to it and want a 'morale-boost' type of film it's great. It stands as a good introduction and also as a regular shot in the arm.

That said, if you've read much self-help or pop-spirituality there's nothing new here. Despite the trailer's frantic pace the actual film consists almost entirely of various thinkers, writers, scientists or self-publicists talking to the camera. Effective but not what the trailer leads you to expect.

The links between historical personages and the Secret are tenuous, being nothing more than quotes or achievements. Unfortunately they are like Nostradamus' quatrains in that they can be used in support of many philosophies/views/methods/ways of life and do not in any way relate specifically to this one - they can be appropriated by anyone.

My one main issue is that the occurrence of A followed by B does not imply a direct link or law of cause and effect between the two. I may scratch my bottom one day and catch a cold the next, but no matter how many times that happens it doesn't prove a law that one leads to the other.

There is no doubt that the law of attraction if applied is usually followed by success of the required type, but this does not mean this 'law' created the result. It may be no more than a mental boost, or an overcoming of doubt for instance, and the steps taken between A and B cannot be dismissed.

1614998,5,B00005JPJ8,"From my rating of 5 stars you can obviously see that I liked this movie.  Looking at many of the other reivews here it seems that you have either ""lovers"" or ""haters"" and not many in between.  Ultimately whether you like the movie or not is going to come down to you and your beliefs.

For me, I enjoyed the movie and it has had a profound impact on my life.  I thought that the theatrical aspect was catchy but probably a little over the top and for some, it may even take away from the legitimacy of the message.

I guess a good place to start is whether or not you believe in the Law of Attraction (LOA).  If you have never heard of the LOA then this may or may not be a good introduction to it, again it will all come back to your basic beliefs.  I knew of the LOA prior to watching ""The Secret"" and although I did believe it had merit, this movie really helped to energize my passion about it.

The beliefs that I spoke of earlier aren't necessarily religious in nature but many people will take that posture.  I myself am not really religous but I do consider myself to be highly spiritual.  This movie helped me to focus on that aspect of my life and gain a better understanding about the thoughts and feeleings that I have had for years.

My scientific belief that everything in this universe is matter and that matter is, in its simplest form, energy leads me to believe that the LOA can work.  If we are ""energy fields operating in a larger energy field"" then is it so hard to believe that at some level we can control not only our energy but also have an impact on other energy?

Here is what I do know: Since I have watched ""the Secret"", I have been a much more positive person and have lived a happier life with much less stress and worry.  I have even received some things that I intended for myself using the LOA.  (You can call it coincidence, but I don't.)  I also know that my friends and co-workers who have watched ""the Secret"" are also living happier lives now as a result of the actions that they have put in place for themselves from what they learned from this movie.

You may watch this and believe that the LOA works and can even empower you.  You may watch this and think it is the biggest crock.  You may fall somewhere in between.  Your reaction is going to depend soley on you and no one else, it has to.  But keep this in mind when you watch: everything they are teaching you should make you happier.  Whether or not you totally believe it doesn't matter.  If you are focusing on positive things and being thankful for what you already have and lose focus on all the negative things, won't you be in a better place psychologically?

Whether or not you believe that ""the Secret"" will allow you to control your destiny shouldn't take away from the fact that this movie can have an everlasting positive impact on your life.  Why not let the negative people live in their misery and continue to blame everyone and everything for their situations.

1615004,4,B00005JPJ8,"""What is the Secret---the great  `Secret of Life?""  That was the question used to extensively market this film via the Internet. It was claimed that the ""Secret""  had been hidden for hundreds of years, by  Roman soldiers, greedy businessmen,  and even the Catholic Church.  It was known and practiced by great philosophers, inventors, and artists (mostly Western, by the way), but hidden from the common people.

When I first watched the movie and learned that the great  ""Secret of the Ages"" was the Law of Attraction, I was more than surprised.  Law of Attraction a great hidden  ""Secret.?""

Well....hardly.

Buddha said, ""All that we are is what we have thought.""  And Earl Nightingale in his taped broadcast ""The Strangest Secret"" aired some  50 years ago, said ""You become what you think about.""

Before Earl Nightingale there were numerous American writers of the early 20th century such as F.W. Sears (see my review on Amazon),William Walker Atkinson, as well as Neville Goddard, who wrote quite extensively on the Law of Attraction.  And ""Abraham,"" channeled  by Esther Hicks, has been  writing and lecturing about Attraction for over 20 years.

So, it's not really a Secret at all.

Still, the movie was very well done and quite entertaining, though nothing more than a colorful assemblage of talking heads, with a few interspersed video clips to expound on the lessons.

That said, I really liked this film!

The atmosphere is very upbeat and LOA, after all, DOES work in a practical manner in your life, IF you let it. And if you make working with it a Way of Life.

There's the rub....

In my experience as teacher, and performance coach over almost 40 years, what I have observed is that most people want INFORMATION, but they don't want to PRACTICE.

And LIVING  the LOA demands practice, lots of it.  A few sporadic attempts at ""positive thinking"" simply won't cut it.  You must begin by first observing the correlation between your overall FEELING TONE (more than your thoughts) and what seems to happen to you in life.

Once you have seen some actual evidence of how LOA is actually working in your life, you can then begin adjusting and refining your approach to using it more effectively.

The movie does give a few general pointers in this direction, but they are rather vague:

1) Good emotions feel good and negative emotions feel bad.

2) Good emotions attract good things and negative emotions attract bad things.

3) Know what you want and keep your vision in mind.

4) Don't fight what is negative; attract what is positive. (In the world today, THAT is indeed a sagely  life principle, all too rarely  practiced).

That sounds pretty superficial, but is just about all the PRACTICAL advice contained in this film.  In my experience, effective practice of LOA takes a much more scientific approach.

Nonetheless, I think this film is an excellent intro for new beginners to this topic. I gave a copy to my little godchildren and they (age 8 and 10)  ""got it"" immediately---and started creating their vision boards!

Some reviewers have stated that the film seems shallow and materialistic, seemingly  concerned only with attracting cars, romantic relationships, parking spaces, or money.  Well, that critique is valid, but I would view using LOA at a beginner's level  to attain easily verified material things as a good way to validate whether and how the Law works for you.  After that, it can  be used in any number of ways and for much more expansive purposes  (abundance and peace in the world, perhaps?)

In the end, I would recommend this film.  It certainly embodies good vibes, is easy on the eyes, and reminds the viewer of some very fundamental truths of life.",1170201600,,3697,4.847756410256411
1615005,5,B00005JPJ8,"Whether or not you believe in the Law of Attraction, you are always using it. You are using it now in this moment. We are always drawing to us that which we are predominantly thinking. This isn't some ""pie-in-the-sky"" notion, this is the Truth. Jesus the Master Teacher said, ""It is done unto you as you believe...""

In just eight simple words, Jesus summed up life for each and every one of us and this incredible movie gets us to remember that each one of us ""creates our reality"" with our thoughts, our feelings, and the images that we are allowing ourselves to predominantly focus upon. Of course, we do not actually ""create"" reality but our interpretations of what comes into our lives can ""bless"" us or ""curse"" us.

Does this DVD tell us anything new? I hate to break it to you, but there is ""nothing new under the sun"". But maybe...just maybe....we need to apply that which we thought we ""knew"". I've been at this metaphysical/spiritual stuff for almost twenty years now and I am constantly amazed at the new insights I continuously receive from those things I once thought I ""knew"".

There will be the ""naysayers"" who say that this DVD is a rip off, but you gotta ask yourself, how many of these people have put this stuff into practice? Yeah, sure, it's easy to change your thoughts --- but keeping them changed, that's the tricky part. We have all been hypnotized to a certain degree about how things are in the world, but the bottom line is that our defintion of reality is not so much a definition of how it really is as much as it is a definition of how we are.

I've watched this movie over sixty times, I've given workshops based on it, I recommend it to anyone who has the ears to hear, the eyes to see, and the spirit willing enough. In and of itself, this movie will not change your life, only you can do that, but this movie will definitely give you those ""glimpses"" of Truth that when persistently and consistently and willingly applied can and will change your life for the better.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""All of life is an experiment."" Be willing to redirect your focus, be willing to let go of old beliefs and form new ones, be willing to be more than you ever thought you could and life will reward you with the greatest reward you could ever hope to receive; a well-lived life.

Peace and Blessings to you all.

This material however is NOT new or secret. See the quote below:

""All that we are is the result of what we have thought. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him."" -Buddha

And there are so many more throughout history, east and west. But for some reason we as a whole have lost this part it seems, or perhaps just drastically misinterpret things. Who knows.

For whatever reason our society has become blinded by materialistic views, and so even when ""the secret"" is right under our noses, we ignore it.

But if this film grabs the attention of the masses and motivates and inspires them to put their thoughts into action, so be it.",1170115200,12,902,4.409638554216867
1615039,5,B00005JPJ8,"As many of the reviewers have mentioned, there are many books out there that express the tenets discussed in this movie.  That is fine for people who love to read.  I read Catherine Ponder's books several times over the years and nothing ever happened.  ""The Secret,"" however, was a much better tool.  The combination of visual presentation and input from several different people made this a winning combination for me.

The best part is that the various people in the movie each have a different perspective, a different piece to the puzzle that makes ""The Secret"" the powerful movie it is.  For those of us who are baby boomers and were brought up with parents who's lives were a reflection of the depression, it is a wonderful announcement that the world we know, the world we were raised in is not the world we are confined to.

After reading through all 112 reviews, I see there are many people out there who poo-poo the idea that we need anything more than good common sense to change our lives.  Certainly, if my experience growing up had included sufficient information to make my life so that would be true.  That wasn't the case.  You can't know how incredible your life can be if you don't see examples of people who are doing it and want to *share* how they did it with you instead of looking down at you for not being as successful as they are.

There are many concepts in this movie besides increasing one's wealth.  I don't fault the film maker's direction of addressing that topic first.  Truth is, when you are working two jobs and still only able to put macaroni on the table at night, a spiritual word isn't going to be at the top of your list.  Money is required to raise children, keep a roof over your head, keep clothes on your back.  If I only have a couple of hours per day to recreate and relax (which includes the watching of movies), it has to catch me from the first minute and if that first minute isn't going to address my current issues it's not going to stay in the DVD player very long.

My life has changed incredibly since I watched this movie.  I went from hating my job and never having money, to watching money come to me before I even needed it - a huge change from watching due dates pass without the funds to make a payment.  Having that security makes me happy and knowing I can bring ""better"" into my life without hating what I have to do for it is a Godsend.

The movie is not meant to be an exact manual for going from point A to point B.  We are all so different, we will take different paths based on our experiences.  What ""The Secret"" does offer is it clearly lays out what is available to us, it shows us how we can get there from where we are, and it gives us examples of past success and tools we can use to make our own transformation.  I watch it every day because the energy of the people in this movie is so incredible, I feel better just being exposed to them.  I take notes with each viewing because I always hear something new that I didn't notice before and many of the tools these teachers used for their own lives work well in my life too.

Is ""The Secret"" for everyone?  Not people who are addicted to living in their own uncomfortable circumstances and clearly don't want to be any better than that.  For those of us who have always wanted a better life for our children or ourselves, ""The Secret"" is one of THE most important tools available today.

I prefer this version over the Hicks version.  Lisa Nichols has a sweet, beautiful spirit that comes from her heart, and as a regular person (as opposed to a channeled entity) her words flow more smoothly for the every day person's consumption.

If you've ever thought your life wasn't supposed to wind up the way it is now, if you've ever wondered what it's like to be the person you've always dreamed of then get ""The Secret.""  I combined it with the use of EFT (accupressure points) and it completely changed my outlook on the world.  (EFT hastens the process if you've had trauma in your life.)

From every point of view, it addresses the power of positive thinking, not only metaphysically, but spiritually, and practically. The greatest thing about this film is that it actually gives practical applications for this power, as opposed to simply discussing it.

 The sad part is, as is evident from some of the other reviews, that not everyone can see it. A perfect example is myself versus my mother. I had spoken of the secret and how powerful positive thinking is, and she had just come down with a cold. I caught the same cold, but, believing I was stronger than any cold, I was over it in a matter of hours. My mother, however, came to me several days later and said, `I've been trying positive thinking, but it just doesn't work'. Ha! Merely saying that proves this film's point.

From the very beginning this movie takes great ideas, like the concept of a higher reality or religous self-perfection(Emerald Tablets), and weaves them into a conquest for materialism and selfish personal gain.

Perhaps it could feel great to own a mansion worth millions of dollars, but not when so many of our fellow human beings are without basic necessities.

The dvd speaks only of this law of attraction, but ignores another law so often spoken about in economic affairs which states that there is no such thing as a free lunch.

In fact, Mr. Hill mentions the secret by name in His book, Think and Grow Rich.

Although I like the product very much, I think one should attach it to their faith, or anchor it to a belief system that they adhere to because to desire money and success without a proper foundation can be as dangerous as having a powerful atom bomb without the moral integrity to know not to use it.

As a writer I intent to make that point in a reply to this concept. As a Christian I know to put God first and then all else will be provided, even more than just putting success and money first where I may sacrifice my integrity for the sake of money and/or success.

However, I have a huge caveat: The health section is way too cursory, and possibly pernicious to anyone suffering from a severe health problem. For instance, they interviewed a woman who claimed she was cured of  cancer in just a few months, without medical treatment. It's very tricky to explain the power of thought to heal one's illnesses without coming off as, ""It's easy to get better! What's your problem?"" To use such a sensational example is grossly simplistic and, in my opinion, heartbreakingly irresponsible.

1615053,5,B00005JPJ8,"I am new to the secret, but within three days, I admit to watching it three times, not because I am a fool and out of that I expected to manifest money in my armpit, but because it is so compelling to our desire to believe, which has been crushed to some degree by heady intellectualism and science and psychology, that I had to share it with people who I thought could find new reason to believe in life's potential and a universal power that could sufficiently replace waning monoGods.

 So the movie is about money, god forbid, a movie made in america, where everybody wins, and buys an absurd spread in california.  But consider the producer of the movie and his intentions, possibly altruistic, but to enhance his own vision of success, he needed to make it marketable.  Assuming the interviews were not scripted, most likely the producer director cut the film to offer the audience exactly what they wanted to package to spread the movie in the fastest way and possibly for an ultimate goal of leading multitudes on a path of empowerment.  In our society, if a message doesnt have a price or a fancy package, it just won't sell as well.  And there are plenty of smart internet college students who are pushing the video for free, just find one, and he will manifest it.

 So with that in mind, if you really study the message of the movie's ""guides"", they do try to speak beyond money, money is the easiest way to spread the whole manifestation ""new age"" (How many new age ideas have gone main stream or actually have a rich academic lineage), but they throw out to you that the possibilities are endless, and would probably like to speak at lengths about their goals that reach beyond their attainment of the freedom of wealth.

 The religious arguments against the movie's ""accuracy"" were not intended as absolutes by their sources. They are aimed at individuals at different levels of spirituality seeking different paths, and like this movie for the hesitant amazon customer, if they are ready to receive a new spiritual opportunity, then they will be guided towards higher aims.  It is possible to conceive of a consciousness beyond the self in the same way that the boy in the movie conceives of a bike, but that requires a progression beyond the initial message of the movie, whether the more expansive teaching of its guides and historical guides.

 I really wonder if the critics of the movie actually gave the whole mindset a spin, like for as long is would be required for them.  Here's mine!  I have spent the last three years up and down with bipolar disorder.  I have been pushed a thousand spins by therapists, but piecemeal they bounced off me. Only recently have I begun to feel ready to receive the clarity of mind to integrate such teachings.  As I watched the movie, it was as though all of the pieces were in place (this will be different for everyone), that with the leap of faith and the belief in self and universe so well constructed by the movie, I could fight off the last of my final negative thoughts.  You see, it is not just the depressed and melancholic who need this ""new age fluff"", we all tell ourselves we cant do things and it comes true, but the ""mentally ill"" really need this, because the depressed are barraged with negative thoughts, and it is proven by psychology that these negative thoughts will drive them into deeper depths in which life becomes hell and nothing is possible, where the pills of science are only band-aids.

 So was it conceivable to me watching the movie that positive thoughts could do just the opposite?  Heck ya.  And I've had the strength to beat down thoughts (your memory sucks, you will never be social, there is a ceiling that is fixed by your scientific composition) one by one because I have positive images of what I will become, and suddenly, like the opposite of depression, I remember all of the positive things in my life that affirm what I am going to become.  Ya ya you can conceive yourself of anything and make anything seem true to the mind.  Well exactly!!  Why the heck not shape your memories and your life experiences into a path towards some self-defined goal?  That's what does it.

 My first miracle!  I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday because I could not feel chemistry.  She was not my soul mate!  (There are many soul mates when you look at the world right and can become satisfied with your position in the ""universe"")  So i decided to try out some of the far-fetched ""possibilities"" the movie suggests.  I have been meditating fairly effectively recently, so I turned to manifestation meditation, and I drew an eye of a woman that I defined as seductive, my ex-girlfriend, on the wall, I sat down, and I imagined my self walking around the college campus with all eyes on me like the one that I had drawn.  I imagined or fantasized that I could play the game of seduction in a realm where just in recent days I felt insignificant and powerless.  After thirty minutes of powerful visuals, I stood up and immediately, my phoned received a text message, from the very same ex-girlfriend, who was supposed to call me two weeks ago, asking if I was awake at 2am in the morning.  I immediately called her and she said she had been thinking about me continuously and we shared a very intimate if not transcendent conversation.

 So that's my very first ""proof,"" if there can ever be any for these sorts of things (oh and jesus visualized himself falling into the water before he walked on it) that will satsify such an enlightened age of thinkers and tinkerers.

Proof that it works in our society:  We all believe in the american dream, maybe not as well as we should, and we have the world's most confident economy.  Our economy depends on people believing it will function, that inflation will remain low, and growth will continue.  And the Europeans don't understand it, but we're a nation built on belief, it leads to enormous drive and creativity.  We all believe in driving our own cars, and pretty much we've devised a system in which we get the cars that we want.  Our movies all talk about following your dreams and oh it was meant to be, not because its something we won't ever have and makes us long for the unattainable, but because some happy person had a very similar experience and had to had to turn it into a movie, it happens again and again.  Our greatest threat is that we become limited by our information streams into thinking that genes pool us into certain categories or we are hardwired to attain certain jobs or diseases.  Look for the tremendous amount of science that pushes the pendulum towards the secret, or the science that is uncertain, because there are forces that it cannot measure.  And for proof of a modern man with ""the secret"", or a tremendous visualization capacity and faith, look at Einstein.

If you try this, step by step you will realize where ""what you think"" runs you into contradictions, and that will require work to overcome them, but if you burn that image strong enough into your forehead, you will fine a way to align your body and your mind in a synchronous direction in which the proof will manifest itself into a world not of false materialism but of happiness belief and higher consciousness, and then you find a new image, you understand what the great figures actually meant, and you start out on a new staircase, first step first.  I suspect that those that new the secret never had someone tell it to them like we are being offered it today.",1169251200,11,7506,4.590704647676162

1615088,2,B00005JPJ8,"I was curious about this movie because it was the number one selling DVD on Amazon, yet I had never heard of it. Thankfully, I didn't pay for it. There is nothing 'groundbreaking' or 'earth shattering' in this movie. It's common sense. If you think negatively, things in your life will continue in a negative direction. On the other hand, if you think positively, positive things will happen. What the producers of this film are trying to communicate is that all of this happens through the ""universe manifesting itself."" No. Wrong.

There's no magical comet in the sky that is the overlord of all that is and was. Things that happen in your life happen because you made choices, right or wrong, to arrive at your destination. This movie tells stories of people battling breast cancer with their minds -- only to have it magically dissolve in 3 months. To think... all those scientists and foundations who have wasted their efforts in the battle against cancer! When all it takes is a chat with 'the universe.' A plane crash 'miracle man' who recovered because he 'willed it' with his mind and the universe responded to the magnetic waves he produced to heal him.

It's no secret the human body and mind are capable of some absolutely incredible, amazing things. Giving the 'universe' credit for those things is a joke. Five minutes into this movie and you feel like you are watching some cultist promotional material. All of the contributors have 90 acronyms after their names. Makes you wonder who they are trying to convince. Watch this if you want a good laugh, but don't take it too seriously.

In closing -- I think that the contributors of this movie 'sent a message to the universe' through 'visualizing.' That message? 'I want to be rich.' And, so, it has happened -- through selling this incredibly stupid DVD.",1168992000,42,1820,4.753164556962025

I love to read, but unfortunately most people don't share my passion and it's difficult to convince people to read books about self-improvement and mind power. They just don't have the time or inclination for reading. With The Secret, they can simply pop in the movie and learn the easy way, through television.

I'd love to purchase any other movies on this topic that are available. I was able to teach mind power to my nine-year-old step-daughter by showing her this movie. It's very persuasive. It's presented in an easy-to-understand way, repeating the key concepts so that you'll remember them, which is exactly what most people need if they are new to the subject.

One of the other reviewers seemed upset that The Secret taught you how to gain money, love, and success, as though desiring money isn't a spiritual thing to do, but the fact is, money is what the vast majority of people need in this world. Poverty is a huge challenge that the world is faced with. If more people understood The Secret, less people would live in poverty and we'd have a much happier world. Not everyone wants to jump right into doing transcendental meditation and astral travel. They need to start with the basics - improving the quality of their life, finances, and relationships. Once they're financially secure, they'll have all the time in the world to sit around meditating and reading spiritual books and getting deeper into the world of self-improvement. Money isn't evil. The most charitable people in the world are usually the richest since they have the most to give. You can't give what you don't have. That goes for love, money, happiness, spirituality, and everything else.

I love the fact that I'm able to sit around all day watching The Secret or writing reviews or meditating if I choose. I can do that because I have a business working from home on the Internet and there really isn't any real ""work"" involved so I can just play around and do interesting things all day. It's a dream job, though I don't think of it as a ""job"". I created my life this way by using mind power. You can learn the mind power basics by watching The Secret.

1615118,5,B00005JPJ8,"The message this movie gives is absolutely true:  your thoughts create your reality, you co-create with the universe.

If you think about something with positive thoughts and emotions, listen and watch for signs and act on them appropriately, then it WILL happen.  Those of us who have practiced this KNOW this to be true.

My only disappointment in the movie was the emphasis on money and material wealth.  Imagine if all of humanity visualized with positive emotion world peace, plenty of food for all, excellent education and health care for all, preserving our environment!

Despite this, bravo, well presented, it's a great start.  Even for those of us who KNOW it to be true, it is a great refresher.

1615121,1,B00005JPJ8,"One Universal Law not mentioned in the film is Newton's Third Law- for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the East, this is described as the law of Karma. Every day, our thoughts and activities (actions) either create harmony or imbalance in the world, and what comes back to us is a exact reflection of what we have thought or done (reactions). Most times, people do not know when they are creating disharmony in the world-- it's not on purpose, but it is due to a lack of wisdom. Wanting things only for oneself without regard for others or the environment creates disharmony in the world, and it is only a matter of time before Karma brings back to the originator in the same measure as what he or she has created.

All beings are subject to this Universal Law (karma), and we see so many people trying to get ""stuff"" or wealth for themselves regardless of how it affects others or the very environment in which they live. But people feel very justified in this because they lack wisdom, not because they are inherently evil. Here is the problem: yes this movie describes the Law of Attraction which is itself not a bad thing, but demonstrates and glorifies the use of it to get ""stuff"" or wealth for oneself, and this is the theme of most of the film. There are those who argue that you have to look deeply into the film to see the true message, but there are great sources that teach the Law of Attraction in it's pure form.

If you have to decipher it out of this film, why not direct people to clearer explanations about it instead of defending this film so strongly?

The Law of Attraction is a force, and if it is used to create disharmony (i.e. working for the benefit to oneself regardless of how others or the environment are affected), the universal Law of Karma will do its work too. And since one action causes an equal and opposite reaction, and if the application of the Law of Attraction is powerful, Karma will bring back to the originator the effects in equal measure.

Discovering or learning about a Universal Law or power does not make one wiser, since it is only a tool. But we don't put guns in the hands of children-- they haven't developed the wisdom required to use them responsibly. To assume that people will be inspired to all of a sudden be virtuous because they discovered the Law of Attraction is not realistic. In using the Law of Attraction, one may think that they are thinking ""positively"" while wanting wealth and material things, but not knowing that they are taking away from others or harming the environment. Again, not because they are evil in any way, but only because they lack wisdom. There was no instruction is this film to use this law responsibly and with wisdom. It has been noted in many reviews that the Law of Attraction has been around for ages and is expressed in every religion. This is true, but it has always been accompanied with a great amount of teaching about virtues (charity, selflessness, compassion, etc.) for very good reason. The only virtue lightly touched on was gratitude, but only for the things received that benefited oneself only (which is not a virtue if practiced in this way).",1168128000,2,3179,4.5524475524475525
1615122,3,B00005JPJ8,"This is simply a self help movie with cool special effects.

I would say it's not worth buying though.  It does as most programs of it's kind focus heavily on financial gain so if you're not motivated by money it'll seem more like a load of bunk.  It's ideas are  really all about positive lifestyle and attitude, which is not much of a secret.",1168128000,12,509,4.43010752688172
1615123,2,B00005JPJ8,"First of all, I just want to say that this review is not being written to offend any of those people whose lives have been changed by ""The Secret."" If this is you, great. I'm happy for you. This review is for those people who are considering spending $30 on this DVD, hoping that it somehow solve all of the problems in your life (helping you get money, a boyfriend/girlfriend, cure your illness, etc.)

In its essence, ""The Secret"" is based on Cognitive-Behavioral Theory, which has been an accepted theory in the psychological community for the last 50 years. Basically, your thoughts drive your feelings, which in turn, cause you to behave in certain ways. ""The Secret"" DVD simply states this idea over and over again and applies it to aspects of life that cause people the most stress: finance, intimate relationships, and health. Moreover, the creators of this DVD add some inspiring anecdotes, some ""experts,"" such as the guy that wrote ""Chicken Soup for the Soul,"" some mysterious music, and quotes from key figures in world history (which may or may not be related to their knowledge of ""The Secret"") and the result is a polished, convincing product that may inspire people to think more introspectively about their lives. However, as a psychologist, I viewed this film as nothing more than psycholgy for the mainstream in a fancy package.

Listen people, save yourself some money and realize this: If you concentrate on positive things, rather than negative things, it is more likely that positive things will happen to you. If you think about your ideal career everyday for five years, it's likely that you'll take some action and move towards that career. If you think about getting a girlfriend every day, and feel confident that you can get one, you'll get one. If you're sick and are able to convince yourself that you are healthy, you'll be healthy. They're called psychosomatic symptoms for a reason. The downside of these teachings are the developement of obsessive tendencies (i.e., I want to date Jennifer Aniston, I put a picture of Jen on my wall, I put 100 pictures of Jen on my wall, I camp outside Jen's house, Jen gets a restraining order), and total letdown/depression, when these things don't occur. The DVD says that it is easy for people to become frustrated when positive things don't happen quickly, and that these things will happen, given more time. I'm saying that the majority impoverished individuals can envision being millionaires all they want, but how many actually become millionaires? If this was a frequent or possible as the producers of ""The Secret"" would like you to believe, movies like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" would not make millions of dollars. It would be an everyday occurence. I cannot believe this is one of the best selling DVDs on Amazon. Actually, I can. People are always looking for a quick fix and what's quicker than a 1.5 hour DVD that promises to change your life.

Here's my take home message: YOUR THOUGHTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FEELINGS AND YOUR BEHAVIORS REFLECT THESE FEELINGS. Save your money and learn a little about psychology. If this doesn't help change your behavior, go to a therapist.",1168128000,41,3165,4.868274582560296

And for all you centrists out there, without even seeing the DVD, it sounds much like thousands and thousands of years of spirtuality repackaged for a different audience.

1615151,1,B00005JPJ8,"While i agree that there's some element to truth in ""manifesting"" your reality by having a positive attitude and envisioning what you want, the overly simplified way this DVD talks about this subject is both insultiing a superficial.  In some ways, this is an incredibly cynical philosophy which essentially blames the individual for not ""manifesting"" hard enough if they suddenly find their wildest dreams aren't coming true.  And what about individuals born into difficult circumstances rather than a life of privilege?  This ""philosophy"" assumes we all start from a common footing, which is just NOT the case.  I think the most shameful aspect of this DVD is that the ultimate goal primarily revolves around acheiving material wealth.

1615152,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've finished watching the $5.00 online version and thought it was great. I originally stumbled across the secret while listening to an interview on the Mike Gallagar show. I can't remember for the life of me who the guest host was interviewing. (I think it might had been Bob Proctor.) Although I'm big on self help, I'm also in many ways a realist. I've read a lot of books that either went over my head and didn't stick or require knowing already rich and successful people. (""Think and Grow Rich"" comes to mind) The big thing I had to look past with this movie, was the conspiratorial, Divinci Code feel (packaging) to it. I'm afraid it originally gave my inner-skeptic a red-light. Hopefully all the gloss around it won't detract too many.

 The beautiful thing about this movie is that it educates you on what you already know. You are responsible for who your are. It kinda sounds stupid, but it's like loosing a set of keys. You know where they are, but you you just can't remember. So you search every place where they wouldn't be until you realize where they've been all this time. To put it another way, you already know everything, but you don't realize it.

  The only conflict with this movie will the one people set in place of themselves. Before watching this I've read a lot of whacky reviews. For the Objectivists among us (I've just rejected objectivism after reading the Objectivism 101 link from the guy at the Kennedy Space Center, because of its limitations) or better yet, the defeatist among us, this movie will be useless, because in order to apply the principle taught in this movie, the Law of Attraction, it requires faith. The same type of faith that your car will start, you'll wake up tomorrow, or putting your finger in an electrical socket will shock you. I believe the Law of Attraction is on the same level the Law of Gravity. It happens all the time, but different people work with it in different ways, consciously or unconsciously.  For those of you who are apprehensive for religious reasons, stop it. The ""Universe"" is a general way of referring to ""God"". I'm a devout Catholic (or I try to be) and I have a deep profound belief in God. I believe the Bible teaches that God only wants the best for you and supplies you with the tools to obtain what you want. This movie supports that. In my case, I want to be happy. I want to create circumstances that feed and support my happiness. Happy people are productive people. Happy people had a tendency of helping other people, which helps to make them happier. This is far from about being self-centered, because if you better yourself, you can better others around you, or make them less miserable.

  This movie won't change your life, only you can do that. But what this movie will do is bring you some clarity, so you will gain the confidence to take that next step towards change.  It's really all in your head, you just have to unmuddle it.

  Go ahead and spent the $5 to watch the online version (if your skeptical) with out the attitude that it's a scam and you'll be pleasantly surprised. I sure as heck was.  I've already purchase the DVD version at a $5.00 discount (since I can't order it direct from Amazon) to watch again and to share with others in my family and circle of friends.",1167264000,21,3284,4.534686971235194

1615154,5,B00005JPJ8,"The Law of Attraction, in my opinion, -is- the fundemental secret to Life!

The concept of LoA, beautifully summarized in this DVD, is inherent in all of life's ancient religions and teachings.  Of course, some will try and negate that fact, but if anyone were to take the time to truly study our world's religions and teachings (more than just at a surface level), one would see the deep correlation between these ""seemingly new"" concepts and the teachings of old.

The problem I see with most people, who tend to discount ""new age"" concepts such as the Law of Attraction (taught in this DVD), is they feel that it threatens their ""old age"" teachings and beliefs.  In my opinion, this couldn't be further from the truth.  I believe that these ""new age"" teachings are nothing but a new way of teachings ""old age"" concepts that have been around for centuries!  Times are new, thus the new way of looking at things (new perspectives), but the teachings, at heart, are still the same!

The last words I have to say are this... I find it very funny that these teachings are labeled as ""rubbish"" or ""pointless,"" by some, when these teachings do nothing but try and bring a more positive outlook on life within ourselves.  Is this so wrong?

Anyways, I feel that this movie is an excellent source for the teachings of Law of Attraction.  If you have never heard of this concept, and have an open-mind, then you should enjoy this movie completely! ;-)",1167177600,11,1444,4.627450980392157
1615155,2,B00005JPJ8,"Though the underlying message is the same (positive attracts positive, etc), this feels like a cheesy infomercial rather than an intriging metaphysical exploration like What the Bleep.  It was recommended to me as the ""sequel"" that ""really explains it all.""  I was really disappointed in the superficial and unsophisticated message presented here and recommend it only to those who stay up late looking for answers from paid TV shows.",1167177600,17,434,5.27536231884058
1615166,5,B00005JPJ8,"... but ONLY if you're ready for it. I've read some of the comments here and it's sad that people see only what they choose to see. But of course that's the Law of Attraction working again -- you get plenty more of what you think about! So naturally, if you think it's a con job ... well, it is.

I saw this when it first came out, which was about 9 months after I read Joe Vitale's THE ATTRACTOR FACTOR, which literally changed my life. THE SECRET does more of the same. It is simply the most visual, clearly-articulated explanation of the Law of Attraction that I have ever seen, and the fact that it's being embraced all over the globe in less than a year doesn't surprise me in the least. Rhonda Byrne and her crew have done an outstanding job in bringing to the world a truth that has always been known ... but not by everyone.

I'm sorry for those who have written negative comments on this list. It simply proves that not everyone is ready to accept the Law of Attraction. For those who are and who have always leaned toward a belief in our own inherent power and the joy and beauty of which we are capable, this will be a revelation.

There isn't a single person I've spoken to yet who has seen this film and been ready to hear its message who has not been completely bowled over.

But please, if you're ready to tear it to shreds as a con job and are already suspicious of its message, don't buy it. You won't get the point, and you'll feel you HAVE been conned. And that would be a shame.

For those who feel they are ready, watch it, listen to it, enjoy it. I have found that repeated viewings only show me more things in it that resonate with me, the sure sign of something of great value.

And by the way, since seeing THE SECRET and reading THE ATTRACTOR FACTOR (which I highly recommend and have reviewed on Amazon), my life has turned around so spectacularly that it's hard to believe I'm living this -- I have far more money, greater health, better relationships, my career is soaring, my family is thriving. Life is WONDERFUL.

It's not coincidence. The Law of Attraction is finally working FOR me, and every day is a joy.

My great hope is that once you see -- and UNDERSTAND -- THE SECRET, the same will be true for you.",1167091200,17,2240,4.2665094339622645
1615167,4,B00005JPJ8,"Bottom line: There's no new message here but the production is well done and will come ""just in time"" for millions of viewers"". It WILL help several someones and that is what's most important!

I needed to hear these messages again, and being the drama queen I am, a good soundtrack helped to further elevate my spirit & renew my interest in taking control of my own happiness again.

Regardless of the higher power that you believe in, this movie will help you seek your answers from within. They are there, ready to change your life for the better!

Highly recommended to those who need uplifting or know someone who does.

You can't please everyone all the time. So for the negative reviewers,sorry that the movie wasn't what you were searching for. Your message will get to you when you're open-minded and ready to receive it. But try not to ruin the good feeling for everyone else! Yeesh!",1167091200,10,893,4.632911392405063
1615168,5,B00005JPJ8,"This DVD can be life-changing if you watch it with an open mind and actually give it a chance. I read many prior reviews talking about this movie and religion. This movie has very little to do with religion. It is about the laws of the universe and how powerful they can be for you if you let them. I can say from personal experience that it WILL in fact change your life for the better, but you have to give it an honest effort and don't judge it before you even understand it. I believe the prior bad reviews written for this DVD are all based on ignorance and a negative opinion of it before it was even viewed.",1167004800,11,614,4.125
1615169,3,B00005JPJ8,"I enjoyed this movie and respect the passion that those who are in it show. It is very professionally done with great graphics and congent and passionate interviews. My complaint is it preaches a religion a belief system while on the surface seemingly benign to all religions. It is Hinduism and man is god. This of course flies in the face of True Christianity and the Life and teachings of JESUS CHRIST.

  The movie employes the Law of Attraction to get all that you want and need..abundance. This is a concept not foreign to the Gospels, in fact it is replete through out the Gospels...JESUS in numerous places states Nothing is impossible to them that believe, ask and it shall be given, believe and receive. All of this the movie teaches BUT where JESUS says its the FATHER who gives these things that our Joy maybe full the movie says its the Universe. This is the poison that will kill. GOD the Father is not an impersonal force a no name law but a Person who created us and loves us and wants the best for us. HE made the Laws that govern this universe so why not go to HIM.

  JESUS said what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and looses his soul. This movies intent may very well have you gain the world but at the expense possibly of loosing your soul. I pray you would seek JESUS and in HIM find all that you need and ask and receive from your Heavenly Father all that you need and receive Life and Life more abundantly from the LIFE GIVER Himself..and all these things will be added unto you...GOD bless JB",1166918400,9,1535,4.331010452961673

1615172,5,B00005JPJ8,"I seek to always develop myself in various ways - including Yoga, Shiatsu, Buddhism, NLP and various other development practises.

I found 'The Secret' online and found it to be a simple and transforming film. Many of the speakers are accomplished Therapists, Business Consultants,  QUANTUM PHYSICISTS etc.. and while, yes, one may find the approach a little sensationalised I feel it adds great value to the world.

You see, we are a culture that is digesting it's information in this 'hyped' format, and there are many people feeling disillusioned and disempowered with the way their life is going and - for whatever reason - traditional religions are not relatable to them and more 'New Age' type seminars/teachings are too 'New Age' for them. To say that this movie is  'of the Devil' and is seeking to promote 'evil' is crazy* We have a world that is totally out of whack, we are all focussing on what is WRONG with the world rather than what is RIGHT. SURELY, a movie that teaches that by being thankful for what we have right now and focusing on the quality of life one desires to lead we can lead a more positive and happy life can't be wrong - we need PEACE in the world, right? So, if people are happier how can it be bad. Some have criticised the use of focus on money and 'things' to be 'non-spiritual' or materialistic values - I say, look beyond the movie - this is NOT what it is saying at all! The movie basically uses these as examples as these are all issues that we face and so it can be described in common language. After all, not EVERYONE is going to want lots of money in life (though it sure does help to pay the bills), or a posh car, or diamonds BUT, if we can RE-PROGRAM our lives so we can BE HAPPY and focus on the GOOD in our lives and be thankful to 'God/Source/Buddha/Higher Power'Allah, or whatever your terminology is the world can be a more peacful place. AND, SERIOUS Scientists are studying the role that energy/vibration plays in our Universe so there IS a lot of fact in the movie. A world that teaches respect for others, happiness, gratitude, love and ALL those things - how can that be EVIL??!!

Organised and seperatist religions haven't done much to keep the world peacful have they?

BE HAPPY and WATCH a copy of this movie and if you are paying attention you will gain basic tools to re-pattern your thinking and make some positive differences in your life - MUCH cheaper than a therapist*

This is a FABULOUS movie and if it translates and transforms the life of people who would otherwise not get this info and has a positive impact on the community we can get this world back on track. After all, we are all one and should stop the sub divisions and get on with the work of making this planet a more peaceful, harmonious and joyful place to live.

As someone who has found it a challenge to look at the positive in life - despite complex Buddhist lectures telling me the same thing - I REALLY got the message from this movie and HIGHLY recommend it for some REALLY practical, fun and EASY tools to transform your life.

Blessings to all, we are ALL ONE!

1615173,1,B00005JPJ8,"I would like to correct a few points from the previous review.  Christians DO NOT believe they have to earn God's favor we know better.  We are also most definitely separated from God and have been since the Garden of Eden.  There is no way possible you could EVER do enough good works to earn your way to Heaven.  God is holy therefore He cannot allow sin into heaven and if you don't think you sin than read this:  ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."" -Romans 3:23

There is no ""Secret"" beloved except that Satan wonders to and fro seeking whom he can devour and he DOES NOT want you to know this.  The only way to heaven and everlasting life is to: ""Confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead and YOU WILL BE SAVED!"" -Romans 10:9

You can not earn this by good works and no one else can do it for you.  The Bible says in Ephesians ""For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works lest any man should boast.""

To be saved all you have to do is believe that Jesus is the son of God and that God did raise Him from the dead and you will be saved.  I've given you the formula if you are ready to accept Jesus into your life as your personal Lord and Savior simply say this prayer and mean it from the bottom of your heart:  God I've really made a mess of things and I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done.  I believe Jesus is your Son and I also believe that You raised Him from the dead.  Come into my life now and stay with me forever. AMEN

Really what do you have to lose by checking this out?  If you're right I haven't lost anything but if I'm right you've lost eternal life and heaven.  But believe me beloved this dvd is a lie straight from Satan and he will destroy you.",1166745600,25,1817,4.002777777777778

1615175,5,B00005JPJ8,"I bought this movie off the website based upon the recommendation of an old acquaintance that I had reconnected with recently at a personal development workshop. She described the movie as kind of like ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", but easier to understand and apply. She wanted to go into more detail and ""sell"" the movie to me, but I told her that I had enough information and that I would check the movie out.

The site allows you to view the movie for $5.00, but my preference was to have a copy that I could view multiple times to get the full benefit. While there is not much new here if you familiar with the concepts of getting what you want out of life, it is put together in a fresh way. Kind of like a favorite meal that you know you enjoy prepared at a new restaurant that gets it just right! It's familiar and new all at the same time.

It is uncanny how familiar this movie was at times. As I was watching, topics of conversation that I had had with close friends over the previous few weeks were replaying before me on the screen. It felt like the directors had scanned my mind and tailored the movie to me. At one point, the topic was so close to  a conversation that I had just had a week prior, that I had to call the friend that I had the conversation with and tell her about it. I paused the movie and as I did, the phone rang, it was her calling! As I relayed what had just happen in the movie and reminded her of the conversation we just had, I felt chills. I was about to verbalize this and she said ""Oh my God, I just got chills""! Wild! I could go on about other interesting coincidences, but it's not what's most important.

What is important is that you watch the movie and benefit from the ideas. While it is true that much of this will be familiar to some viewers, how many of us ""know"" something intellectually but don't apply it? One of my goals in getting this movie was to ""saturate"" my mind with these kinds of thoughts so that I get more and more of what I want out of life naturally as part of who I am. Considering what you have to gain from this information the cost is small.

Enjoy, and may you experience some wild coincidences of your own that will let you know just how real this stuff is!",1166572800,27,2231,4.143187066974596

I have never loved more, I have never brought in more wealth, and I have never felt better.  I am stunned where I am today.  I will not hype this DVD anymore than anyone already has.  I have shared it with many of my friends that already started believing their lives could actually be better.  After watching, they realized their lives could be amazingly better.  When shared with someone at the bottom of the bottom or someone who really does not believe their life can be better (that is except through hardwork and more hours at work and another degree and more money...) this DVD with be worthless.

1615187,2,B00005JPJ8,"""The Secret"" is about the intention-manifestation model and how to use the law of attraction to create whatever you want. The intention-manifestation model says that your goal is an effect to be achieved, and your task is to identify and then create the cause that will produce the desired effect, thereby achieving your goal. The movie points out that most people focus their thoughts either on what they don't want or on reinforcing what they're already getting.  The movie says that the way to succeed with intention-manifestation is to keep your thoughts focused on what you desire, even if it seems to have no presence in your life yet. Speakers in the movie included Jack Canfield, Joe Vitale, Fred Alan Wolf, John Demartini, and Denis Waitley.

There are good points and bad points to this movie, depending on your perspective and religious background. On the good side, it is absolutely true that there is power to positive thinking no matter what your circumstances are. Any physician will tell you that all kinds of catabolic hormones are released in response to being negative. It is true that if you are wishy-washy about a particular goal that you subconsciously will do things to sabotage yourself because deep down you may not believe it is possible to perform the goal that you have set. The problem I have with the ideas presented in this movie is that they have the potential to make a person self-centered and also unsympathetic with people who have trouble in life. Although there is a lot of talk in the film about goals that are ""for the greatest good of all"", it seems odd that one of the major efforts spawned from this idea is the ""Six Million Dollar Experiment"", in which the goal is to attempt to use the power of intention to manifest $1 million for each person who chooses to participate - hardly a lofty humanitarian goal. As far as breeding a lack of sympathy, I don't remember any specific comments in the movie, but the book of the same name by Rhonda Byrne has some comments about turning your back on the overweight because fat thoughts make fat people. If you believe that your own thought process is god over your situation, it is easy to blame people for their problems and ignore them. In this respect, I see this particular philosophy held in ""The Secret"" to have a lot in common with the ""prosperity gospel"" which is very popular in some of the Christian mega-churches. The thought process there is that God wants all of those who do His will to be rich and prosper, therefore, if you are not prospering you must not be doing His will and it is your own fault. I just think it is dangerous for any human being to believe that everything in their own lives is under their own personal control.

And there is much more to all this than JUST the movie itself -- namely, two books that you can study.  The main one is ""Ask and It Is Given,"" by Hicks.  The accompanying workbook is ""The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,"" also by Hicks.

I have been involved in a study group for several months now, and we are all working through the ""Ask and It Is Given"" book.  The material in the book is incredible, but I would probably never have been attracted to it if I had not seen ""The Secret"" movie beforehand.",1166486400,15,723,4.398496240601504

They cut out Ester Hicks, who's teaching is a big part of the secret and you can ""Feel"" the difference, for those in tune with energy you know what I mean. For those not I sound crazy to you, but this entire universe is energy and once you learn to feel the subtle energies you will never go back and what seemed crazy before seems 2nd nature now.

Don't listen to any of the negitive reviews, or those saying ""The Secret"" is no big deal or it B.S. or if you know religion you know this. Sure Christ taught it yet less than 1% of his followers have any idea how to apply ""The Secret"" or what he taught, they just pray to him which was not his message. This video will do more for you than 100 years of going to church becuase it is simple and not cryptic. If you are a christian it will only enhance your faith. And if you are not a christian it won't preach Jesus to you. It good for everyone.

This breaks it down so every one of all religions can apply ""The Secret""  This is not a theory but a fact. What the bleep taught the theory, ""The Secret"" teaches you how to do it.

This is a life changing video that has helped everyone I have loaned it to or given it to as a gift. It has also helped me go forward much faster.

I have been studing positive thinking, religion, science of mind, metaphysics most of my life since age 8. There was always something missing that prevented it from working.

I found what it was about 10 years ago and with the missing key my life changed. I went from totally broke no car, living with my mother, and bad credit, to my own,place a new mercedes and good credit and making over $100,000 a year in just a few years. Using what the creators of the secret would call ""The Secret""

We all have ups and downs, I think I forgot to use ""The Secret"" and my life took a slump I got back into this way of thinking again by Reading ""Excuse my your life is waiting"" By Lynn Grabhorn, it opened my eyes to the power of being happy and gratitude. Then I found Abraham-Hicks another step forward. Then one day someone sent me a link to ""The Secret""

I watched it and was amazed and empowered, There is something about that movie that will motovate and inspire you. It realy did not teach me anything new, but it reminded me and I watched it again and again, I have watched at least once a week for the last year!

Turn of your news and watch the secret and program you mind for success, watch it untill you think that way. And apply the principals and your life will change for the better! It does work 100%

Those the get nothing from this movie are either...

1) Not ready for it.

2) Closed Minded.

1615194,1,B00005JPJ8,"A friend of mine bought the DVD for myself and my wife.  We watched it twice, the second time with some friends, and discussed.  There are positive aspects to the spiritual message, including a focus on positive thinking, belief in a higher power, a degree of purpose and order in the universe, the beauty of sharing with others, and the physical/mental/emotional benefits of cultivating positive thoughts. However, the movie goes much too far into materialism and greed, as well as promoting a level of selfishness that borders on solipsism.  Furthermore, none of the claims made are well supported.

  In one diorama, a boy wants a new bike.  A narrator dialogues his inner struggle and ""coaches"" him (and the viewer) throughout.  The boy is encouraged to obsess over the bike, to cut pictures of it out and carry them with him everywhere, and to focus on this hunk of brightly painted aluminum with all of his soul and mind.  He is told to not only want it, but to know that the Universe will give it to him.  In the end, the Universe provides when his grandfather(?) buys it for him.  How does this not teach us and our children blatant materialism?

  Viewers are encouraged to identify themselves with their desires.  Is that the way that one should define oneself - ""I am what I want.""?  Aren't humans more than a list of wishes?  Is the ultimate expression of human nature ""Gimme! Gimme!""?  Could the ultimate relationship with the Creator be a response of ""Sure, I'll get you anything""?

  To its credit, the DVD does spend some time discussing positive thinking, and talking about how mental patterns either positive or negative have a profound effect.  In a roundabout way it encourages contentment as an aspect of being positive.  But contentment is then shown as a tool, a necessary hoop to jump through, only a requirement for getting something ""greater"" in some material form from the Universe - such as a relationship, or a new car.  How does this not teach manipulation as a means to getting what you want?

  Besides honoring materialism, the DVD also promotes avid self-centeredness.  For example, a man tells a story about how he had not heard from an old friend in a long time.  So he used the Secret - he thought/wished as the ""Universe"" listened.  He imagined himself and the friend talking on the phone.  He focused, and obsessed, and imagined, and then...one day the friend called him!  Wow!  The man realized that the Universe does indeed revolve around him - he only had to grease the wheels!  My point is to say, that if the man had actually missed the friend, he might have, using a bit of selfless empathy (putting himself in the other's place), realized that maybe the friend was missing him, too.  And the first man would have picked up the phone and called his old friend - no twisting of the galaxies necessary.

 So, that covers ""unhealthy.""  By unsupported, I mean that there are many claims made, but little proof shown.  First, there exists a general need for proof of the entire framework - how do we know that this actually works, or is true?  How do we know the creative being behind everything is a big Vending Machine in the sky?  Amongst much pseudo-science garble, the DVD gives two supporting ideas.  [Sorry, I'm not counting the  presentation, albeit riveting, of magical healing ""gratitude rocks"" (on sale on the Secret's website for a mere 15$ each.)]  Support:

  1.  ""If it doesn't work for you, you're not trying hard enough."" (a paraphrase of James Ray's discussion of the seedling)  How many cults, get-rich-quick schemes, pseudo-magical ideas, cures, and products have been sold to millions with this tag-line?  The Church of Satan, even, makes these same claims.  One could prescribe push-ups for cancer with this addendum, and then blame the patient for his/her own death!  This is hardly solid support.

  2.  ""Historical figures, geniuses and scientists from the past have used this."" (my paraphrase, again, from the DVD packaging, comments, and quotations used).  This I and my friends found both laughable and alarming.  Could Beethoven, who died in poverty and agony, have forgotten to use this Secret to make a little more income?  The filmmakers suggest that he was one of the historical figures who knew all about the Secret.  Are we supposed to assume that he not only wanted poverty, but obsessed on it?  Asked the Universe for it?  What about his deafness - was that a wish as well? Every woman to whom he proposed turned him down, and he died unwed.  Surely the Genie of the  Universe could have helped him out a little in the relationship area!  Yet in one major section the viewers are asked to believe that this ""Secret"" would help anyone find that ""special someone.""  Ridiculous!

  The alarming aspect of this is that apparently any claim to a historical figure's spirituality can be made, and, unless someone happens to disprove it, it stands.  How is this not libel?  Should one be allowed to reference Ghandi as being an Anarchist?  Lincoln a Freemason?  Hitler a devout Buddhist?  Just because the spiritual lives of the people mentioned in the DVD are not well known does not give the writers the right to gloss any facts that they wish into the script.  But perhaps Rhonda Byrne has made it her ""hearts' desire"" that this should fly unnnoticed, and the Genie of the Universe is trying (in its clumsy, gullible, eager-to-please way), to make it happen.",1166140800,59,5431,4.778856526429342

It was stuff I've been hearing in various formats over the past few years, but it made me get out of my chair, go for a walk, and renew everything in my life. I have seen past successes, but there were things emphasized in this movie that I had never thought about before - different ways of formulating thoughts and clarifying issues. I say 5 stars for material, 5 stars for graphic production, 5 stars for the experts, maybe a 3.5 or 4 in presentation; it can get a bit tedious hearing the same things over and over, but if you stick with it, you will see how to apply it to every single area of your life.",1165881600,27,1115,4.391304347826087
1615216,2,B00005JPJ8,"The self-help and actualization movement (SHAM) in America today offers two polar opposites of empowerment and victimization.  The former argues that anyone can accomplish anything with enough force of will while the latter claims that everyone ultimately has no control and that someone or something else warrants blame for any misfortune one experiences.  Admirers of Ayn Rand would likely much prefer to spend time with empowerment types than victimization types due to the former's optimistic sense of life.  Nevertheless, the empowerment movement has so enamored itself with New Age ""primacy of consciousness"" metaphysics as to drive away even the most open minded Ayn Rand fans living by her realist philosophy, Objectivism.  Given the amazing feats that people can accomplish with reason as their guide, this makes the empowerment movement especially tragic.

If anyone wants to grasp in one concentrated place the best and worst aspects of the empowerment movement, The Secret offers such an experience.  In a single 92 minute rapidly paced video documentary filled with impressive visual effects, a moving score and a parade of impressively credentialed and influential speakers and authors widely respected within the empowerment movement, the viewer gets a feast of all that the movement has to offer.  Sadly, that feast comes laced with a poison of profound, misleading, mystical errors and evasions that can literally lead multitudes of gullible viewers off the cliff of reason into the abyss of self-delusion.

The Web site for The Secret tantalizes viewers with trailers reminiscent of The Da Vinci Code claiming that ""the secret"" has remained the private information of select elites throughout history.  With this information, the teasers claim, these elites have risen to power, earned fortunes, and kept the masses at bay in the toil of fields and factories.  The creators of the movie assert that they have become the first in history to make ""the secret"" available to common people across the globe.

The video opens with a woman in dire straits attempting to get her life on track.  She learns of ""the secret"" after researching the successes of great men and women throughout history.  After more staged theatrics, the movie finally gets down to business.

What exactly constitutes ""the secret""?  Talking head after talking head explains it as the ""Law of Attraction.""  The entire video argues that the universe responds to thoughts and manifests whatever a person habitually thinks.  With dazzling special effects, the film shows various actors ""reenacting"" different situations, ""broadcasting their thoughts"" into the world and then experiencing externally the content of their internal, repeated, focused thoughts.

So, the argument goes, if you focus on the rotten nature of your job, your marriage, your social life and so forth, you will continue to manifest those awful experiences.  Conversely, if you change your habitual thoughts to how great you want those parts of your life to become, then eventually the universe will respond like the genie from Aladdin's lamp: ""Your wish is my command.""  Under this alleged natural law, anyone who couples enough emotion and sincere belief with repeated affirmations and habitual thoughts will eventually coax the universe into delivering the goods to his doorstep.

To abuse further the key term ""natural law,"" Dr. John Hagelin, former candidate for the Natural Law Party and champion of Transcendental Meditation, figures prominently in this documentary.  As do his many fellow gurus, he excitedly talks about how wonderfully well the ""Law of Attraction"" works for all who sincerely apply it.  Testimonial after testimonial gush forth from true believers.  They claim that because they wished, affirmed, felt and visualized with enough ""power of intention,"" they encountered abundance in all areas of life.

Nave persons unfamiliar with the basic axioms of Objectivism -- existence, identity, consciousness -- and seeking a better life while avoiding the victimization route will find much appealing here.  Unlike the morally arrested, subjectivist dupes of The Secret, however, Objectivists grasp that to act with genuine purpose requires knowing exactly what one wants, why one validly wants it, and then employing reason to achieve it.  In that regard, then, ""visualizing"" exactly how one wants to experience the future can guide a person into experiencing that future provided he acts rationally and productively toward that purpose.  If The Secret admitted to this limit then Objectivists would have little quibble with it.

However, this movie goes well beyond those objective limits.  It asserts, in effect, that one does not need reason at all but can simply focus on ""visualizing"" and ""experiencing"" the future using ""affirmations"" in order to ""attract"" what they want from a universe that becomes as obedient to human will as Aladdin's genie: ""Your wish is my command.""  Objectivists know better: A is A, and existence possesses primacy over consciousness.

Can an Objectivist employ a variant of the Law of Attraction that maintains sane metaphysics?  Yes!

In the Objectivist metaphysics, the root of volition consists of the choice to focus.  A person can focus his mind to bring reality into cognitive clarity, defocus it to turn his cognition into a fog, or even focus it away from reality to a fabricated world of evasions.  In addition, the ""crow epistemology"" captures the finite nature of human consciousness.  A person can only hold so many units of focus in his conscious attention at any one moment before his mind turns into a fog of ""too many units.""

Because a rational person needs to act with a clear sense of purpose, he needs to choose a life affirming purpose consciously and then maintain that purpose at the center of his focus so he can act productively toward it.  His purpose gives his subconscious ""standing orders"" to begin working on the challenge of achieving it.  Through reason, he can evaluate all concretes he encounters as beneficial, irrelevant or detrimental to his purpose.  Because he keeps his productive purpose ""in front of himself"" cognitively, resources he might not otherwise notice begin to grab his attention.  They existed already, but he never noticed them until he focused on his purpose and his need for those resources.  His consciously chosen purpose thus ""attracts"" his focus toward the resources he needs to achieve that purpose.  This sequence of explanations preserves the sane ""primacy of existence"" of Objectivist metaphysics and offers a fully grounded version of the ""Law of Attraction.""  It stands in stark contrast against the insane ""primacy of consciousness"" subjectivist metaphysics of the ""your wish is my command"" crowd in The Secret.

Learning to focus on a manageable number of productive purposes and to achieve them through rational action offers the real formula for earned success in any endeavor.  But the people behind The Secret want to keep that fact a secret.  Otherwise, they would have to pack their bags, return to the primitive swamps of their Witch Doctor ancestors, and wallow in the mud in which they would have to live without the assistance of the authentic producers -- those who proudly apply reason to accomplish life affirming, consciously chosen, productive purposes.",1165795200,68,7342,5.288793103448276

It's been wonderful for me, especially since I started to apply the laws of attraction. I've come into a lot of money lately. I've also had good things happen in my personal relationships with people.

1615219,5,B00005JPJ8,"I saw this movie over the internet from The Secret website, and I have to admit I was (happily) glued to the screen from start to finish.

The messages in this film are certainly life changing, and learning HOW to apply the law of attraction in your life will definitely turn your life around.

The visual effects in this film are excellent, and what is even more superb is how real people who are luminaries in the fields of quantum physics, spirituality, medicine, and life 101 - going from the bottom and rising to their highest ideals all SHARE how they apply the timeless principles in this film in easy to understand (easy to apply) language that takes the new age ""woo woo"" out of this incredible teaching, making it accessible to anyone.

You can ""feel"" the honesty, sincerity and passion the people have who share and relate in this film how the universe is really at your service, delivering in a neutral manner whatever you focus on, and truly believe in.

Beyond inspiring, THE SECRET is an amazing experience to view, and take in while you're viewing it.

What I loved most is how ""real"" and down to earth the people are in the film, and how they genuinely shared how they used the principles in their own lives, along with the results.

For anyone who is going through challenges in life, I HIGHLY suggest you watch this movie! I do have the book, which is great to have when you need a quick reminder.

I feel the movie delivers the messages with tremendously vivid, strong and memorable impact - which is a triumph in its own right.

This is one movie/DVD that you will gain so much from watching ANY time you feel down. It's THAT awesome.

You'll want to always remember to set your intentions with all of the feeling in your heart, visualize your ALREADY having it, as in past tense, then let the UNIVERSE take care of ""HOW"" it all comes to you. We're a lot more connected to receiving than many may realize. Once you get out of your own way, and allow the universe to do its job, you'll be AMAZED and astounded at how SIMPLE true manifestation is on ALL levels of life.

This extraordinary movie will make an enormous difference in your life - if you're looking for a gift to give anyone, at any time, I would get them this DVD. It TRULY is a most beneficial gift to humanity! IMHO, it deserves an award for all of the good that its messages can potentially create for positively transforming ordinary people's circumstances into extraordinary lives.

1615220,5,B00005JPJ8,"""There is a lie that's like a virus in the mind of humanity that there's not enough for everyone."" - Michael Beckwith from The Secret DVD

To tell you the amount of synchronicity that brought this DVD to me would be staggering. I'll just share a little bit before I get to the actual review (but, sharing how the Law of Attraction *works* via this ""testimonial"" should give you food for thought, too!)

A few weeks ago, I caught the tail end of a Larry King show featuring Michael Beckwith and J.Z. Knight (they were the only two people on the panel I recognized by sight). I liked how the panel presented the idea of thoughts creating reality (the law of attraction), and was especially moved by a story shared by one of the panelist. (Turns out that the guy's name is John Assaraf--a former street kid who's now a life coach). Here's the story: John is working on his office when his little boy asks ""What's in the box?"" John had moved several times in a five-year period, and the box in his office held his vision boards. After asking his Dad ""What's a vision board?"", John shows his son what they are, figuring that showing would be easier for a 5  year old to understand.

You see, a vision board is a poster board or cork board where you paste/pin representations of what you want to attract in your life. Well, John looked at one of his past vision boards and tears welled up in his eyes. There, on one of the boards created years previously, was a picture of a house. But not just ANY house. No, it was THE house that HE WAS NOW LIVING IN. He didn't realize that the house he bought the year before, and renovated, WAS THE EXACT SAME HOUSE (an aerial view) FROM HIS VISION BOARD. He then realized the awesome power of the law of attraction.

As I'm watching this on Larry King, I'm thinking ""Holy crap!"" Now, the law of attraction isn't new to me, but this was the most mind-blowing story of deliberate creation that I've ever heard. So I excitedly tell my husband (who was sleeping at the time of the airing) and he answers ""No way!"" We were psyched, and said we'd create our OWN vision board.

In the meantime, I get an email from one of my readers asking me about the law of attraction. Twice in the email he mentions ""The Secret"". In fact, in the second email, he says ""Well, you've seen The Secret, so what do you think?"" And I'm thinking ""Why does this guy keep acting like I know what this Secret thing is?!""

So I do a search for The Secret on Amazon. I end up getting a copy of the DVD, and the same night (last night) my husband and I begin to watch. At the very beginning, the music and images brought me to tears--I don't know why. In Pentecostal/Charismatic circles, they'd call it ""the anointing"". I was so moved--and so psyched--about this movie (even though I really didn't know what it was about, who was on it, or what to expect.) I just knew that what I was seeing was going to enhance my already blessed life.

Well, it just so happen that several of the people that were on the Larry King show were in this movie! Unbeknownst to me, they were plugging this movie earlier in the show. (J.Z. was plugging her Ramtha program, I presume.) And guess who was on there? John Assaraf, sharing his vision board story! Woohoo!

There were other bizarre synchronicities, including four different things that were said on the DVD that my husband and I *just* said/concluded within the last 24 hours. (For example, I'm reading an excellent book by cardiologist Mimi Gaurneri called The Heart Speaks, and had the epiphany that stress created by my worrying about my high cholesterol was a worse contributor to my numbers than trying to micromanage everything that came into my mouth. In the DVD, John Proctor--who is HILARIOUS, by the way--observed, ""Disease cannot live in a body that is in a healthy emotional state""--something I JUST said to my husband, in effect, mere minutes before the movie!) There were several times I paused the DVD and said ""Oh my God"" as we were hearing EXACTLY what came out of our mouth in an earlier conversation.

The Secret features around 30 authors, teachers, life coaches, and inspirational speakers sharing their experiences and insights on the law of attraction. (E.g. Neale Donald Walsch, Michael Beckwith, Dr. Denis Witley, John DeMartini, Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, Dr. John Gray, Hale Dwoskin, Marie Diamond, et.al.)  Basically, the law of attraction is ""like attracts like"". This is why expecting a crappy day and complaining about stuff yields more of the same--as well as people who will reinforce the same vibration. It's also the same principle as ""laugh, and the whole world laughs with you"".

The stories and insights the contributors share are utterly exciting, inspiring, and even surprising. One man, Morris Goodman, was in an airplane crash, becoming completely paralyzed. He was on a ventilator--suffering broken vertebrae, a destroyed swallowing reflex and diaphragm--and told by the doctors he'd basically be a vegetable, only able to blink his eyes. However, he pictured being a ""normal"" person again and resolved to walk out of their on Christmas day. Guess what? HE DID. (And he shares his story on The Secret).

Another incredible story was that of Jack Canfield, creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul book series. He describes the amazing synchronicity that led to him making almost 100,000--just as he intended.

What makes The Secret DVD different from other law of attraction products is that it explains that a rich INNER life is what gives context to outward success and ""stuff"". I especially loved the wisdom shared by Lisa Nichols on this topic, as well as how she became her own ""sHero"". I also applaud the emphasis on the importance of ACTION--following inspiration that the Universe provides in answer to your desires. Sitting on your butt--having a wishbone instead of a backbone (my words) is NOT advocated on this DVD!

No word is out of place on this DVD. The music and graphics are outstanding (and, in my opinion, this DVD accomplishes what What the Bleep TRIED to), as is the grounded wisdom shared by all the wonderful contributors. These people come across as compassionate, kind, sensible, joyful and grounded individuals who want the SAME for you...for us all. There are no fake accents on this DVD--no New Age gobbledygook or channeled entities or mystical theatrics. Most especially--and importantly--there isn't a HINT of superiority or chilly narcissism that one often finds in law of attraction books.

The law of attraction WORKS. I've drawn things into my life with ease because I expect it. For example, I've always had wonderful ""luck"" with men, and now enjoy a beautiful, fulfilled marriage to my soul mate (9 years strong). I attracted my wonderful husband because one of the things I KNEW from the time I was young was that I was a queen and that I deserved to be treated like one. I'd never marry or attract an abusive, philandering idiot because I never EXPECTED to. It simply was not in my consciousness.

Now, I've struggled in other areas, especially health (I watched my first husband--a ""name it and claim it"" preacher, of all things!--suffer and die from leukemia). This formed my belief that the law of attraction couldn't/doesn't work on health and healing. However, through time and experience, I've concluded that I don't know what my husband's contract was--and it's certainly not for me to judge or assume. BUT, I can choose, right now, to apply the law to my own healing from high cholesterol and iron deficiency anemia. And, as a result, I've lost 35 pounds in the last few months and feel definite improvements!

Also, my husband and I chose to focus on some things we'd like to attract, including $. Less than 24 hours after watching the movie and making this decision, I received $75--unexpectedly--from someone overseas. More is on the way. I've also used the law of attraction (at the time, I didn't know what the law was, but I knew certain things for sure) to attract a computer--my very first. My husband would ask ""How can you expect a computer to come out of nowhere?!"" Well, it came from one of HIS co-workers...and my husband, after watching me do my magic several times over the years (LOL) is now convinced there's something to it!

Here's just a few snippets of some of the inspiring wisdom you'll find in The Secret DVD:

""Inner happiness is the fuel of success.""

""If it ain't fun, don't do it!"" (This is so true!)

""Thoughts of greed, fear, stinginess, and lack creates the same.""

""Energy goes where attention flows.""

""Happier thoughts lead to a happier biochemistry.""

""Incurable means curable from within.""

""What you resist, persists.""

""Fortunately, there's a delay between thoughts and manifestations.""

What you'll find in The Secret DVD are laugh out loud moments, poignant stories, encouraging cheerleading, and immediately useful information that will enhance your well being. By using your feelings as a gauge, you'll be able to discern your preferences in life, as well as how you are deliberately creating through your thought patterns, attitudes, and beliefs. What can it hurt to get this DVD and try your own experiments? You can start small and apply it to any area of your life. The engaging, wise teachers on this DVD will show you how--and your life may never be the same again!

(This is easily done as you will want to share it over and over.)  I can't understand why the producers of this film seem to be hesitant about getting it into wider distribution.  For instance, why isn't Amazon selling it directly?  The message is so important and powerful, I find myself showing my copy to everyone I can find who shows a mild interest and has 93 minutes to sit still and watch.

Minor critique:  It does start out in a very materialistic vein and doesn't get into more spiritual realms until late into the film.  But the reality is that the material and spiritual (energetic) are one.

For those who are offended that the film encourages asking for material wealth in a world of limited resources, you are missing the point.  The real Universe is limitless, conscious and able to manifest limitless abundance for EVERYONE.  My God -- the Source of All, the Ground of Being, the Unity, Etc.-- can do this; if you think your god can't, I suggest you reevaluate your faith!

It's always easier to say 'nay' or 'ppphhlease' :) of course, and there is nothing wrong with that either.  Beliefs make fanatics, scepticism could be handy when they attempt to brainwash you, but this film offers only an idea, and ideas, as long as they don't turn into a dogma, are good to try out, again, if they make sense to you, if you so to speak 'resonate' with them.  My convictions come from experiences where i exercised trial and error, and i can say that 'the secret' works.  Humans have been long either programmed by someone or programming themselves.  We all do it to a lesser or greater degree.  So, why not program yourself with something that is good for you, considering the well being of others of course.

1615224,1,B00005JPJ8,"This movie is reminiscent of the book, ""Who Moved My Cheese"".  It takes spiritual laws that are powerful and provoking, and twists them for profit and materialism in a way that can do more harm than good. (While greatly enriching the bank account of the producers!)

The movie has some wonderful points, such as gratitude being an energy that helps us create more of what we love.  Also, we attract what we think about. The movie also had some wonderful examples of the power of positive thinking in healing physical ailments.

Where this movie goes wrong, painfully wrong, is leading people to believe that by focusing on the ""stuff"" that they want will make them happy.  In fact, obsessing over the ""stuff"" you want can make you unhappy, because in essence, you are focusing on your lack instead of staying joyful in the present moment.

While it is true our lives might be more comfortable when our desires are met, ultimately, only love and compassion can heal you.

When you focus on your true purpose, which entails delivering your unique gift to the world, rather than focusing on your desires and ego gratification you can experience the joy of fulfilling your destiny.  This does not mean suppressing your feelings of doubt and self worth by only focusing on ""happy thoughts"" and ""what you want"", but rather healing the wounds of separation through nurturing love and compassion for yourself and others. It is a subtle distinction, but a profound one.

Also, the very premise that the Law of Attraction is a coveted secret is fabricated.  You will find this concept in all spiritual texts. It is a beautiful concept, one that helps us remind ourselves to stay positive and to trust that things will work out for us. What the great spiritual teachers also teach us is to be kind to our fellow humans and to the earth.  This movie speaks nothing of charity, of service, of being present, and of purpose.  This was all about having what we think we want.  Be careful what you wish for!  This movie can lead you in the wrong direction.

If you believe you live in abundance of wealth, your mind will look everywhere for that evidence. Because of that, you become more aware of things that can attract wealth into your life and lo and behold, opportunities start to ""show up"". The truth is that opportunities have been all around you, you just weren't paying attention!

While it's not reproducible, I see it everyday. People attract the things they think about the most. People who live with a scarcity mentality usually do bad, people who live with an abundance mentality usually do good.

For this reason I say there's some truth to this ""secret"".

Although I don't believe that this secret can give you have a million dollars, I do believe that if you believe you have an abundance of whatever you want, you WILL do much better than if you didn't.",1164499200,40,1256,4.511013215859031

It blew my mind away!!!

You have to watch it over and over again! It's amazing!

My DVD arrived super fast! I watch it every day, sometimes only one Chapter due to my busy schedule - but it's worth it! It keeps me focused in the secret of ""The Secret"".

The message of the movie is revigorating and very very simple to understand.

Our planet will evolve faster due to the information that is given thru ""The Secret"", more and more people are practicing the secret of ""The Secret"".

Don't just watch others getting wealthy and living a dream life...a life you wished for yourself! Watch the movie and make it happen NOW!!!",1164326400,20,714,4.412213740458015
1615237,5,B00005JPJ8,"I've read a lot of metaphysical and self-help books over the years so have been exposed to the general theme and contents of this dvd already. However, the way it is presented is very inspiring and energizing and I found myself nodding my head in agreement throughout the video and silently cheering. It touched my feelings in a way just reading about it never did. People that have obtained wonderful results were in the presentation and it's presented in such a way that you feel like you're a part and can do the same thing. I definitely recommend this dvd.",1164326400,16,560,4.61
1615238,5,B00005JPJ8,"I have never, written an online review, but I could not let another moment go by without taking the time to share my most sincere and most heartfelt comments about this movie!  I am not a holistic practitioner. I am not in the metaphysical, new age or alternative medicine fields. I am not a public speaker, nor author, nor anyone with specific interest in this field other than an INSATIABLE inner quest to learn and grow!  I am the average consumer.  A person just like you who has questions...fears...hopes and dreams. A person who seeks and yearns for answers because there is a relentless internal question within me that I beleive is within all of us.  I can go on for pages about the series of coincidences and divine encounters that led me to this movie a few months ago, but I will simply get to the point.  This is by far the most amazing, beautiful, deeply profound and inspiring work I have seen!  Even as I type this I am moved to tears and gratitude. I watch this movie every moment I can and feel blessed and grateful to be alive and SOOOO excited at the turning point that mankind is now embarking on. WE ARE divine...WE ARE powerful...WE ARE evolving and WE ARE are all special and part of a beautiful tapestry that knows no religion, race, economic or social distinction! These are just man made illusions, limits we have imposed on ourselves that we can now overcome.  There will be times when you may feel lonely, sad, discouraged, or temporarily lost but this movie will help you realize who you really are. It will help you remember what you already knew when you were a child. It will help you re-connect with that part of yourself that is the ""real"" you. The powerful, special, ""capable"" you that can have a life full of joy while genuinely wishing joy for others as well. Blessings to all...",1163980800,23,1816,4.5182926829268295
1615239,5,B00005JPJ8,"I know that at least 2 versions of this movie exist and I've only seen half of this 'EXTENDED' version BUT I really prefer the 1st version with Esther Hicks and the message in the 2nd seems to be basically the same.  Are you as happy as you want to be?  24/7/365 happy?  Well, I'm not ALWAYS happy but watching this movie sure puts me in a good, positive mood and I really like showing to friends because they all seem to love it as well.  If you get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!  :-)
BTW several of the online bidding websites have the original if you don't mind paying extra (trust an unknown reviewer -the ORIGINAL version is well worth the extra money!!!)",1163635200,9,671,4.130769230769231
1615240,5,B00005JPJ8,"Several reviewers seem to have a problem with the idea that material abundance and spirituality can coexist harmoniously. Evidently they appear to believe that to be spiritual, one must take a vow of poverty, or at least modesty. And fault is found with Jack Canfield for espousing the type of material success that has transformed his life as a result of practicing the principles in THE SECRET. I believe that this is old, tired and antiquated thinking. Whether one finds themselves living in a heaven or a hell purely stems from their attitude toward all that life has to offer them.. they get to choose. Abundance is not innately good or bad, but for many, managed properly it can provide a richness of experience that living in the lack of it will not.

  I have read and listened to the teachings of Jack Canfield and several others from THE SECRET and find what they are offering to be a great help in bringing a much broader range of experience into what would otherwise be very ordinary lives. And it does apply to much more than just new cars and big houses.

  I love this movie and its message!",1163635200,15,1106,4.5606060606060606
1615241,5,B00005JPJ8,"In my opinion, there is no better film than this if one is looking for a better understanding of the laws of the universe. If you want to improve your financial situation, your relationships, your career, or whatever you're currently living, than this is the movie for you!

The film features a litany of modern-day teachers, including Jack Canfield (author of the ""Chicken Soup For The Soul"" series), John Gray (author of the ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"" series), and Morris ""The Miracle Man"" Goodman. Each not only offers a unique perspective of how thoughts create reality, but they also offer anecdotal evidence of how this philosophy plays out in all of our lives.

And it's the examples that are the real hook here. The stories offered of life-changing events that have not-so-coincidentally followed a change in the thoughts, emotions, and overall vibration of the teacher in question. If you're not familiar with the Law of Attraction, then this could be a real eye-opener for you. If you are familiar with it, it's a great gift for those in your life who are looking for a clear path to getting what they want.

And the choreography and production values are top-notch. It has the look of a high-budge thriller, with much more of a payoff than most of Hollywood's blockbusters. You will not be disappointed. And if you are, re-visit it in a couple of years and then see how you feel about it. Certainly, we are not all on the same path or on the same place on our paths, and as such, this material may not speak to you at this time.

So wherever you are in your life, just sit back, shut off the lights, put your feet up, and prepared to be blown away by, ""The Secret.""",1163116800,33,1691,4.552631578947368
1615242,4,B00005JPJ8,"This is a powerfully made documentary regarding 'positive' thinking. However, there really is nothing new to those of us who have read Peale's book The Power of Positive thinking and other get rich books. This is not to downplay this DVD because the world needs it now. These guys give a lot of information that has been part of the curriculum of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment for over 19 years. The RSE is an academy of the mind and takes the student beyond positive thinking. Yes, there is something more to be revealed. The Secret is only the first step.",1163116800,15,562,4.574257425742574

I bought 100 copies of it and have been sending it to all of my favorite people on the planet.  When I watched it, I was jumping up and down and laughing and clapping with joy.  It's so simple to understand, and it's presented in such a fun way -- it will be the best money you've ever spent.

So buy it, watch it, and then show it to someone else!!!

This film transcends any particular religious or political beliefs and merges science with spirituality like no other film.  I thought it was much better than ""What The Bleep Do We Know"".

I also recommend, if you like this film, that you read ""Ask and It Is Given"" by Esther & Jerry Hicks.

7942213,1,B00005JPJ8,"Movie all about the negative vibes you send out into the atmosphere, and how to re-direct them to effect positive changes in your life through, what?  unknown powers that be?  It tells you to concentrate positive thoughts and feelings, even when your mind is in the opposite state, and the universe will respond-in-kind to them, and reward you.  What force-be-with-you is this?  Sure, it is helpful to be positive and folks around us respond to that, but it makes living, the meaning of life, all about you!  About your thoughts, feelings, and living is dependent on yourself in holding up this burden. How are you going to do that? And how much and for how long?  They don't know. What an imprisoning philosophy!  This sounds good on the surface, but it is the antithesis of Christian faith in God.  People fail, but Jesus does not.  In this movie, a implementing a positive outlook brings good things to you, and is called the 'law of attraction', and they tell you it exists even if you don't believe it.  Perhaps, but it is nebulous and weak.  Christians do not adhere to this philosophy.  Christ came to free us and redeem us from all that.  For our faith is in The Almighty Father, and His Son Jesus, and The Holy Spirit.  You want good things to come your way?  When you are struggling with negativity, you go to the Lord in prayer and ask Him to deal with it and change it.  Then your feelings will change for real.  Trust Him to be in the driver's seat of your life and save you in death by asking Him, ""Come into my heart, Jesus, forgive me, and save me"".",1526169600,,1565,4.435087719298245
