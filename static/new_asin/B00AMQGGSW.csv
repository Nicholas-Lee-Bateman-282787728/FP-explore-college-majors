8553881,3,B00AMQGGSW,"This depiction of Lenny Bruce's life and career is fascinating from a personal, relationship account particularly with his ""wife"", manager, and others. Great cinematography with the interviews, Etc.

What the movie glaringly left out was Lenny's pinnacle of success as a comic around 1959-61. It flashed from early career to later career. No Steve Allen shows, live at Carnegie Hall, what??",1503360000,,390,5.39344262295082

8553886,5,B00AMQGGSW,"LENNY is a must have for Lenny Bruce fans. Hoffman turns in a brilliant performance. ""Mr. Saturday Night"" ain't too shabby either.",1429660800,,130,4.954545454545454

8553888,4,B00AMQGGSW,"I gave this tandem presentation Four Stars because Mr. Saturday Night represents a time in America that is all but forgotten and should be preserved for posterity. Billy Crystal brings that home to us in a brilliant performance.  Lenny is a story that lacks substance, background and nuance. The life and work of Lenny Bruce is sorely lacking and not well depicted here...but even at that...no other film exists about him so even this, should be an entry for posterity. Had Lenny been a stand alone film it would be a Two -Three Star rating maximum and that only because it was Lenny Bruce who changed comedy forever and brought it to a new reality. The set is a real kick because it depicts two completely different types of humor, comedy and times in this country. Most people today do not remember Lenny Bruce at all and if they do it is only because he was jailed for obscenity so many times.  His was a tragically short life and even Dustin Hoffman cannot pull this screenplay off as something of import.  Billy Crystal, on the other hand, is a comedian's comedian.  There cannot be a comic, past or present, that doesn't adore Billy Crystal and what he has done for that bygone era and comedy in general.  The man is an absolute treasure and genius. In Mr. Saturday Night he shows us the life of a typical Borscht Belt comedian and most comedians from the late 40's and early 50's came from that genre. From the Catskills to Vegas and every television show that existed at the time...these comedians were the mainstay of what was considered great comedy in the American heyday of talent. Crystal hands us that comic in spades and he is  brilliant in the role.  Then came Lenny Bruce...and without his important input, we would not have seen the likes of comics from Richard Pryor to Sam Kineson to many of the harsh political comics and so many of the in your face, foul mouthed comics that let us know comedy could be different and was indeed different for different folks! This tandem presentation is where East meets West and North meets South and is pretty much dead on.",1401148800,3,2080,4.575268817204301
