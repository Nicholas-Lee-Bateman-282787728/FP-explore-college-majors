8224617,3,B000WOSB1E,"Princess Diana lived an incredible life, and her tragic death shocked the world. This documentary film takes a look at the controversial circumstances surrounding her passing and poses interesting questions. It, however, has big problems in both its shortness and lack of detail in some areas. Viewers will get the feeling that this probably should've been twice the length and featured even more interviewees.",1524528000,,410,5.421875
8224618,4,B000WOSB1E,"With interviews, re-enactments, and actual footage this examines the final day of Princess Diana. Frustrating to watch. I wondered if they could have called in a helicopter to leave but it appears she wanted to be seen with Dodi otherwise she may have put on a disguise. Apparently they had a slightly drink bodyguard (not a professional driver) race them off into the night in an attempt to outrun photographers on motorcycles, doubtful that was going to happen.

Says that due to her critical state (she apparently had a heart attack) they had to drive slowly (really!) to the hospital so as not to upset her body and she have another heart attack! Surreal, difficult to comprehend. Includes CGI wreck reconstruction. Just a real shame, and for what? Nothing!

Claims that it was a possible assignation due to her badmouthing Prince Charles, shares conspiracies. Decide for yourself after watching. She was 38 years old! RIP.",1501804800,,927,4.974193548387097

8224622,5,B000WOSB1E,"As all the History Channel productions, this episode
focuses on the mystery around princess Diana's death - and in an objective manner, presents several theories for the viewer to ruminate, and draw a conclusion.",1258502400,4,212,5.264705882352941
8224623,5,B000WOSB1E,"This was an informative DVD on Princess Diana. It still didn't clear up the mystery of the death of Diana, but it did come out with some possibilities. I would recommend this DVD. The DVD came in good condition and in a very resonable amount of time.",1258243200,5,250,4.340425531914893
