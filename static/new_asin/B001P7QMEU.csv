8332511,3,B001P7QMEU,"Though I don't clearly recall&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Low-Blow/dp/6302669928/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Low Blow</a>, other people must have found it memorable enough to warrant a sequel  Blood Street. This one surprised me: even though my experience with Leo Fong has been poor and diminishing his budget doesnt sound like a way to improve his output, his first shot-on-video adventure is an entertaining spectacle. Judged on its own terms, this is an imperfect but ultimately fun little diversion.

The story: While investigating the disappearance of a millionaire (Stan Wertlieb,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-Hollywood/dp/B000EXDRLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to Hollywood</a>), private detective Joe Wong (Fong) is drawn into a deadly gang war.

Pictures filmed on video inevitably remind us of home movies, and in that regard, many people won't enjoy Blood Street by default. However, the feature is photographed and edited with professionalism, and there are few instances wherein you wouldnt presume this was created by pros. That doesnt save the picture from weak dialogue and an imperfect narrative structure, but the more you watch, the more its style seems natural. By its final act, the movie has become a jumbled flow of poorly-connected scenes, but its oddly harmonious in a careless kind of way.

Most importantly, the movie is fun. For all the faults with his final product, Leo Fong clearly had a ball shooting this and his enthusiasm is catching. There are plenty of unnecessary but amusing character embellishments to make you shake your head and chuckle. Joe Wong may be a homophobic chauvinist with sociopathic tendencies, but he can do a trick where he punches a thug so the guy's hat flips onto his head. Speaking of which, the action content is decent. Theres no set standard, with some scenes so bad theyll make you grimace while others are thoroughly satisfying. Leo Fong plays such an untouchable superman that he makes Steven Seagal seem modest, and while most of his encounters are forgettable, he has a surprisingly good bar brawl. Karate icons Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gymkata/dp/B00005JP3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gymkata</a>) and Chuck Jeffreys (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmoon/dp/B000034DDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmoon</a>) show off a bit but are not used to nearly their fullest extent.

A strong supporting performance by Stack Pierce (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Rage-in-Harlem/dp/B004YCKJGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Rage in Harlem</a>) helps cement this one as an entertainingly average outing, and definitely the best Leo Fong vehicle Ive ever seen.  Nevertheless, there are much better karate flicks out there, so other than Fongs fans, the only people I can recommend this to are VHS collectors. Dont go out of your way, but if you happen across it, give it due consideration.",1452384000,,3102,6.321513002364066
