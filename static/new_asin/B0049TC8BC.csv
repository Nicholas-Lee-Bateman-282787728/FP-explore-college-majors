4294716,5,B0049TC8BC,"Now here's an interesting premise for an anime. It's got cute girls, aliens, panties, magic. What more can I say for my opening paragraph? Oh, the DVD's are generally uncensored, so it's an ecchi anime, don't like then you might not enjoy this one.

The story starts in the year 1939, A mysterious Black cloud appeared in the sky, Aircraft were sent to get rid of the black cloud, but soon after they attack a mysterious black aircraft emerged from the darkness and fired lasers to wipe the fleet out, this is where the battle with the Neuroi began. In order to combat the Neuroi threat, man worked to make a new weapon, this weapon was known as the Striker Unit, a special set of plane engines powered by magic one wears on their feet and legs. A call went out to all the nations of the world to recruit witches with the potential to weild these Strikers, thus the 501st Joint fighter wing was formed. Now we meet Yoshika Miyafuji, a middle school girl from the Fuso Empire, she soon finds herself being recruited by the Strike Witches, of which she refuses as she hates war. That is until she receives a letter from her supposedly dead father, Dr Miyafuji, the inventor of the Striker unit. She goes with them to find out if her father really died. I'll leave it at that for now.

The art style is pretty standard for the character models, they are pretty cute in this respect, where the anime seems to excel is the designs of the weapons and striker unit, modelled on actual World war aircraft and weapons. There are one or 2 instances of which small attempts at 3D are trying during flight, which works I felt.

The soundtrack is appropriate considering the themes, war time band fair and orchestral songs as well as more cutesy music. Some is memorable while some isn't as much. The Opening and Ending themes ""To do what I can"" and ""Bookmark ahead"" are cute but don't feel different or unfitting. But then I have heard the songs over and over through my headphones from a dual album. The dub now I'm sure some of you are curious to know about. Considering the reputation Funimation seems to have for dubbing from the fan sub group, the voice work is not bad at all, no voices grated on me but a need to adjust to the voices might be needed, but as per usual the original Japanese voice work is included.

Now for the DVD's, for a fan like me, the DVD cases are lovely, featuring art of 8 of the 11 Witches spread out over the 2 covers, the cover case that keeps the DVD's together has a synppsis on the back featuring Shirley and Lucchini (Characters not included on the DVD cases) and some screen caps, which are pretty sweet. Whilst Miyafuji completes the set on the front of the case. The DVD's themselves feature different art of Miyafuji.

The contents on each disk are:
Disk 1 - The first 6 episodes and the option of voice work
Disk 2 - The final 6 episodes, the voice work option and Trailers from Funimation

Not much on the disks, bare bones stuff but I can give it a pass

Overall, Strike Witches is a series of fan service to both the otaku crowd and the aviation fans, the story might seem unfocused till the final few episodes but most episodes have character development, Art isn't going to win any awards but it's very cute. A soundtrack that is fitting and a pretty good dub to accompany it.

It's a personal favourite of mine, so if it sounds like your kind of thing then I implore you give it a go .",1283126400,4,3423,4.379527559055118
4294717,5,B0049TC8BC,"At first it looks like little more than fan service on a stick. Get past it, this is one of the best stories I've seen in a long time. Character development is good and the story line is engaging and well written. It's not as generic of a storyline as it seemingly starts out either. Due to the ""fan service"" and some adult situations I'd probably not recommend it for children, at least not without adult supervision and having watched it first. On the plus side for parents, there's not a lot of blood and it's handled tastefully (It IS a war, injuries happen).
  The setting is an alternate world where WWII was preempted due to an alien invasion and the only effective force to fight them is magic. Magic is not commonplace, so witches are recruited from all over the world to fly the ""Striker Units"". (If you look at the case, you'll see one on each leg of the main character). They even have magic propellers keeping the ""WWII"" feel intact. The countries are all renamed to give it a more ""alternate world"" feel, but it's not hard to figure out. I prefer not to give away the storyline in reviews. I will say there is an interesting contrast in the main character, who fights only because she wants to protect as many people as she can. (And at first seems to be an adamant pacifist, which never entirely fades). There is also some interesting character development around why people fight and the effects their reasons have on them. A little simplified, but it is only 12 episodes.
  LASTLY! This is a DO NOT MISS IT anime for most fans, almost regardless of the type you like. Don't pass it up if you don't like one aspect of it, like setting, or combat, or fan service. It has a wide range of appeal!",1278374400,8,1709,4.415873015873016
4294718,5,B0049TC8BC,"I didn't expect the grandest of story lines but I was was very surprised by the over all quality of the story. In some of these ""Cute girls fight evil geometric shapes"" animes you can often have a laps of story but this show delivered a story that, in typical anime fashion, was heart warming, action backed, happy, sad and dared to blur the lines of good and evil and reality and fantasy.

I would definitely recommend this set to everyone, but be warned, as is typical in some fan service anime there is some animated nudity, and mild sexual situations but nothing too obscene (there's no sex or anything like that) but all together nothing that is horridly vulgar or overly violent.

And a heads up, season 2 has already been announced, hopeful it will get dubbed and released state side, cross your fingers!",1272844800,,811,4.586206896551724

Girls without pants fly through the sky with the help of their magical powers and fight back.

Aside from those two things, there's also a lot of comedy to be had in this series.

I first saw this when I friend of mine tossed some links my way while on a game we both play, and needless to say I was laughing my butt off half the time... I was hooked.

If you're a true Anime Fan, this is definately worth your time.",1272758400,,502,4.197916666666667
4294720,4,B0049TC8BC,"I bought this anime on a whim and found it highly enjoyable. I was surprised to find it rated TV MA but this did not detract from the enjoyability of the series. The series keeps anything questionable to a minimum and although it may have a few questionable parts, it never felt like it was perverted.

The first two episodes are a little slow but after the third episode the series really picks up. The ending had a different feel, the story looses its lightness and gains a more action feel, then the rest of the series but helped tie the whole series together. I would recommend this series to any mature anime fan.",1272240000,,618,4.421052631578948
4294721,5,B0049TC8BC,"While it has many of the trappings of a typical light fanservice title, strike witches has more spark than you would think. Varied and memorable characters, quality design elements (the series if derived from a collection of figurines produced by a popular designer where elements of classic WWII aircraft are blended with kawaii teen girls), a decent storyline and good pacing. If you enjoyed ""Sky girls"" this series is, IMHO, better. Strike witches is on my short list of series which deserve more recognition than they get.",1269734400,22,526,5.057471264367816
4294722,5,B0049TC8BC,"While it is true that the Anime is mainly cater to groups that would appreciate fan-service, there is small details here and there that I found very surprising and amazed at the same time.

First of all, all 11 of the main heroines are based on a actual ACE during WWII and there striker units resembles the airplane of the respective countries. The sounds effect for all the guns are accurate, you can hear the loud and distinct sound of each bullet being fired from the BAR, and the rapid fire of the MG42.

Story-wise, nothing that will really drop your jaws, but it flows wells and does it well. The animations is also well done and very smooth. The dogfights are a treat and they use actually WWII formations and flight path are all coordinated.

If you happens to like WWII and Anime and don't mind some fan services then this is definitely for you.",1268352000,27,855,4.467948717948718

4294813,5,B0049TC8BC,"Definitely a good show, with a good story line. A lot of it is typical, reused story lines, but the show definitely does have its uniqueness to it.

Then I started watching it and found that they ran around in their undies while fighting.. Wait.. What?? No, I must be imagining.. wait.. this is anime.. Nevermind.. they went there.. lol Yup, that was about it.. Then started watching it and found it to be pretty good. If you wanted to compare it to a show on the same level, I would probably kind of go with martian successor nadesico. But with a better ending.

I would say that you probably have an idea as to what the show is about, and I am sure others have done a good job describing it already, so no need to go there. All I will say is that it was well worth buying. In fact, I have re-watched it too.. It was good enough to do that. What more is there to say.

4294816,5,B0049TC8BC,"As a WWII history buff as well as a Japanese anime fan, I knew I'd have to give Strike Witches a try eventually, but I'd been putting it off until recently because from what I'd heard it seemed just too ridiculous.  Recently a good sale opportunity forced my hand, and I bit the bullet.  The result?  While Strike Witches is hardly perfect, it is a lot of fun and should not result in serious injury from uncontrollable eye rolling.

Johnny Carson used to say that, ""If you buy the premise, you buy the bit,"" meaning that if you accepted the basic concept, you could accept a story written under that basic concept no matter how demented it might otherwise appear.  Strike Witches provides the perfect opportunity to test this theory.  On this alternate version of our Earth, World War II is being (and World War I was) fought, not between Human enemies but rather between mysterious (and all but totally evil) alien invaders and a united humanity.  What's more, because of the nature of the enemy only magical weapons worked against the Neuroi, and magic could only be wielded by young (teen or pre-teen with the rarest of exceptions) females, called witches, who rode into battle on mechanical brooms attached to their feet, called striker units, that were inspired by the fighter planes of our WWII.  I've yet to hear a good, logical reason for the lack of pants though....

The twelve episodes of the first season mostly concentrate on the story (or back story) of individual members of the crack international 501st Joint Fighter Wing, known as the Strike Witches.  Japanese central character Yoshika Miyafuji gets the first two episodes to do her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergeant-York/dp/B000HWZ4CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergeant York</a>&nbsp;arc from pacifist to potentially the best fighting witch of all, and Lynette Bishop, Gertrud Barkhorn, Charlotte E. Yeager, Sanya V. Litvyak, and Minna-Dietlinde Wilcke each get their own episode.  That leaves one all fan service episode about panties thievery and the four episode climax.

The best things about this anime are the beautiful animation, especially of the frantic air battles; the loving and accurate depiction of the WWII era Japanese warships (particularly IJN Akagi); the striker unit reimagining of WWII era fighter planes; and the depiction of a small military unit rising to the challenge, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few"" with so much of their rear ends exposed.

The worst things will take a little more explaining.  First, some (but only some) of the fan service was overdone to the point of boredom because if you've seen one spread-legged, tight-panties-clad camel toe, you've pretty much seen them all (I swear some of these were repeated stock shots!).  The very frequent bare breasted bathing scenes (Boy, these girls were fond of cleanliness!) tended to be better because they differed from each other and usually advanced the plot.  Finally, the game of panties, panties, who's got the panties in episode seven was both clever and funny.  Second, a fascinating plot complication, a seemingly friendly humanoid Neuroi was introduced and then completely dropped without explanation.  Third, the main character was arguably the least interesting character in the show, not bad you understand, but more than a little predictable in comparison to the aging witch trying to keep fighting even as her magic faded away, the confident commander who fell to pieces in the face of someone she cared about taking excessive risks with her life, and the shy and fragile night fighter who was beginning to lose herself as she fought all alone, to name just three.

Note: In contrast to so many anime and manga about coed institutions, this anime was almost completely devoid of any he-ing and she-ing.  There was a whole lot of female bonding in all senses of the word, but almost no male-female encounters at all, much less romantic male-female encounters.  There were various good reasons for this, including the base commander's overreaction to her own failure to get over losing a boy very dear to her, but the upshot is a distinct ""yuri"" undertone.  It is mostly played for laughs, but there are at least three clear examples of female characters whose affections for another female character go well beyond sisterly.  Interestingly, in all three cases this affection not only goes unrequited but all but completely unnoticed.

The story continues in Season 2.

Note: There are two different Blu-ray/DVD editions of this series to choose from.  The original edition consists of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B007V9EAA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B006MWA974/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;while the current edition consists of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-Season-1-S-A-V-E-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00GS1YP6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: Season 1 S.A.V.E.

(Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>.  As far as I can tell the only difference between the two is that the original edition Season 2 set comes with a box designed to hold both seasons' cases.  (There are also DVD only editions, but since they are priced higher than the S.A.V.E. multi-format sets, there seems little point in choosing them.)

Note: There are a number of Strike Witches episodes not yet released onto home video in America.  These are the Strike Witches Pilot OVA, which must take place sometime after episodes 1 and 2 of the first season, if it fits into the continuity at all; the three episodes of the Operation Victory Arrow OVA, which take place after the second season, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Witches-The-Movie-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B01IPEAHGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Witches: The Movie (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, which takes place after that.",1452211200,,6471,5.979414951245937

4294828,4,B0049TC8BC,"A series that has a lot of action and some questionable fashion choices. Please enjoy my review for Strike Witches

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) The setting is mid 20th century as in like an alternate WW2 where instead of Nazi's invading its aliens called Neuroi. The Neuroi are bent on destorying the entire human race so its up to the strike witchs to stop them! Our MC (Main character) is  14 year old Yoshika Miyafuji, who has the magical ability to heal people, one day Yoshika and a friend get into a minor accident where Yoshika heals her friend instacally. When a passing Strike Witch fighter sees what Yoshika did, the Strike Witch lands and tells Yoshika that she is Mio Sakamoto and wants to recruite Yoshika to help heal the injuried in their squad. Yoshika refuses but then gets a letter saying her father is killed in action while healing others so Yoshika takes Mio Sakamoto's offers and joins the 501st bragade to fight the Neuroi. When they get to base Yoshika is met by all the other strike witchs, each strike witch member personafies each country during WW2 except they are all on the same side and wanting to destory the aliens. The Neuroi are aliens that take on different forms of attack air planes, battle ships and other major veichals that can cause destruction.

Story line: over all the main story line is to stop the Neuroi from destorying the earth while each strike witch member learns more about themselves and how to better them selves in combat.

Netural Note: it will be seen in all 12 episodes for the 1st season where that all the girls (no boys members at all aka entire girl cast) NEVER wear any Trousers or Pants at all. They are constcally seen in the underwear/panties with just a shirt thrown over their top. If you ever seen the anime jokes on the internet ""oldest looking one in the show is the youngest and the youngest looking one is the oldest"".

Cons: what I hated most about this series is the background stories of the enemies aka the Neuroi. Ok so they are aliens, Check  . They are invading and destorying the earth, Check   . Why are the Neuroi invading? ummmmm nope sorry NO check. Where did they come from? No check again. Do they find out anything about the Neuroi other than they are aliens trying to destory the world? Nope sorry. They just never written in who, what, where, when, or why the Neuroi are who they are. It's like the creators of the show are thinking when they made this series ""Its just like well we need a villian in the series, lets put an alien destorying stuff, enough said!""

Over All: I enjoyed the series, You should buy this and the sequal Strike Witches season 2. You can read my review for it also!! please do!!",1430438400,,2710,4.514285714285714

Yes, it has a bit of mature content and there are a couple of tongue-in-cheek innuendos. But, by no means is any part of this show pornographic.

4294855,5,B0049TC8BC,"Strike Witches is a mecha musume anime set in an alternate version of WW2. Instead having to deal with the evil of the Nazis in Europe and war with Imperial Japan in the Pacific, the world of Strike Witches sees the analogues of both Axis and Allied powers allying themselves to face off against a species of genocidal, sky-bound aliens known as the Neuroi. The show primarily focuses on the escapades of Yoshika Miyafuji, a fourteen year old magical girl from Japan (Fuso in the show) who volunteers to join the 501st Joint Fighter Wing aka ""The Strike Witches"", an international amalgamation of veteran witches who are fighting to both keep the skies of the United Kingdom (Britannia in the show) safe from the Neuroi as well as the liberation of France (Gallia in the show) from the enemy before them. Along the way, we see Yoshika learn the values of camaraderie in battle, witness the effects of PTSD, and try to search for what happened to her father, a scientist invented the titular flying associated with the show, a magical powered flying machine known as the Striker Unit. Oh, and she never once wears pants.

Strike Witches has a lot of pluses, but perhaps the best thing about the show is that it manages to not take itself seriously while at the same time taking itself very seriously. At its core Strike Witches isn't all that different from other non-anime documentaries about a specific unit in war such as Band of Brothers; the witches of the 501st form bonds that go beyond just comrades and allies to levels of sibling love (and even some romantic love) all out of a desire to get through the war that they're on the front line of on a near daily basis. This premise alone is usually enough to make a gripping show, but with world laws as seemingly fantastical as Strike Witches's alternate version of WW2 (*cough*nopants*cough*), such overt seriousness/bleakness would've certainly appeared trite and stale. Instead, the show takes a far more light hearted approach that focuses on the sisterly, familial bond fostered between the various witches of the 501st. More then any documentary on a single unit not named Band of Brothers, Strike Witches manages to stress that although some people go to war for ideological reasons, some for money, some because its all that's available, at the end of the day soldiers fight in battle for each other, and it does this as a complete work of fiction nonetheless.

On top of that the cast of characters in Strike Witches are among some of the best I've seen in a long time. Part of this is because they remain compelling even though they almost all fit into certain cliches and tropes. Yoshika is your typical sort of naive immature rookie protagonist who later matures and understands the severity of her unit's situation and the war at large as it goes on, but at the same time never becomes the same sort of cold, grizzled veteran that you'd expect her to become by the end of the show. Mio, the witch who recruits Yoshika to join the war against the neuroi, is the kind of fearless, driving authority figure with all the bushido sensibilities of an Imperial Japanese soldier while Minna, the commanding officer of the 501st from Germany (Karlsland in the show) is the sort of level headed, logical, near unflappable (don't want to spoil the show) commanding officer whom the entire unit respects, a sort of the Dick Winters of the series. On top of these characters there are others who clearly lampoon cultural stereotypes of various national cultures; Perrine Clostermann's overtly pretentious and perhaps bratty nature pokes fun at stereotypes of the French, Gertrud Barkhorn is your classic rather anal-retentive German disciplinarian, and Charlotte ""Shirley"" Yeager is the sort of buxom, dashing war hero who's as much as celebrity to the United States as she is a soldier. Less defined are the characters of Erica Hartmann (a laid back prodigy/smart-allack), Francesca Lucchini (a prankster with 'wandering hands'), Lynette Bishop (an inexperienced witch lacking in confidence), Eila Juutilainen (overtly confident with a sensitive side), and Sanya Litvyak (a mysterious Eastern European beauty), but all of them manage to come together in a way that highlights their positives, negatives, and how they put their heads (and magical talents) together to solve all kinds of problems both on and off the battlefield. Not to mention the varied personalities result in a lot of cute humor.

The animation and sound of the show is also top notch. You would expect the witches of the 501st to move like they're on rails while in flight, but instead the viewer is greeted to an absolutely phenomenal display of hard maneuvering, natural flying characteristics, and gripping battle scenes. The striker units themselves are made to look like WW2 fighter planes (though its hard to tell the difference between them aside from colors and propeller nacelles) and the guns all have great detail, though the girls never seem to actually have to reload them (aside from Lynette who's armed with a bolt action rifle). The airplane sounds produced by the striker units sound sort of prerecorded, but they're period correct and don't sound like they belong in another era, as goes for the gun noises. Backgrounds such as cities, oceans, clear the sky, cloudy sky, and the countryside use touches of CGI to add a sense of depth, both never really go over the top in a way that makes the show feel like 2D figures in a 3D world. Perhaps the one fault in the animation are the neuroi, whom up close are animated purely with CGI and, aside from a few moments involving small, highly maneuverable neuroi, often behave like they're either getting towed across the screen or on rails. I can't say I know how giant aliens would fly, but it would've been cool to see the neuroi fly in a less straight manner more then they do in the series. Also, their ""shattering glass"" deaths could've perhaps been made to look a bit more exciting.

If there are any weaknesses with Strike Witches, it's that beyond the sorties, the sisterhood, and the minor love interest moments (and all the ecchi-stuff), there isn't much of a crisis until the last four episodes of the show. At that point the viewer is greeted to a plot about the folly of taking the human element of war, but it feels rather underdeveloped and is something I would've liked to have seen this plot elaborated on more. Perhaps that would've taken away from the light hearted/sisterhood aspect of the series, but it would've been interesting to see the story of the series end play out over perhaps one or two more episodes. In some retrospect though, touching on the show's numerous subplots of romantic interest and sexuality in as brief of a fashion as it does prevent things from going into the super-otaku fanboy stage that would've absolutely ruined the series.

In short, if you like anything to do with aerial combat, world war two, magical girls, or just want to see some underwear, Strike Witches is the show for you. Complete with a strong cast of characters and phenomenal animation, Strike Witches is the rare show that manages to take itself seriously and lampoon itself successfully all at once, and its definitely worth the buy.",1393977600,4,7242,4.832393231265109
4294856,5,B0049TC8BC,"Ordinarily I don't include a plot synopsis with my reviews, but I'm making an exception in this case.
In an alternate universe, a group of teenage girls with magical powers--""Strike Witches""--are
fighting the Battle of Britain. Instead of Nazis, they are fighting hordes of bloodthirsty aliens
called Neuroi. They do so by means of magical flying gear which is donned like a pair of thigh-high
boots--which is apparently the reason they go around bare-legged all the time.

Be warned: this anime depicts not panty-shots, but the girls running around in their underwear as
part of their official uniform (horrors!). (One episode becomes a game of ""musical panties"" wherein
one girl misplaces hers, takes another girl's, forcing her to take another's, and so on. It is done for
comic relief from the often rather grim storyline, and is done so whimsically that it is hard to
imagine anyone taking offense--at least no one who would be watching at all.) It also contains some
bath-house nudity, but Strike Witches is much more than your run-of-the-mill fan-service anime.

There is a war going on, with all that implies. There is tragedy and triumph, terror and bravery, selfishness
and self-sacrifice, and above all, a cast of characters one can't help but identify with. The growth of the
main character, Miyafuji, from someone who says at the start, ""I won't help you fight your war,"" to
someone who realizes there are things worth fighting for--even dying for, if it comes to that--I found
particularly moving.

The art-work is as good as any I've seen; the aerial battle sequences in particular demonstrate superb
animation.

If one must find something to object to, with Strike Witches it is that it's too short--just twelve episodes.
It ends too abruptly, as if someone told the writers after episode eleven, ""Hey, people. One more show
to go, so let's wrap it up."" Nevertheless, it is still well worth your time and money. See it!",1393632000,2,1935,4.962962962962963

The voice over is pretty good but like all cartoons/anime the mouth does not move with the words correctly. it could have been better if aniplex did the production instead of funimation due to the fact that the unnatural beams of light wouldn't annoy people and they can stop complaining about it.

Yes theirs alot of fan service (and id like to say if your 1 of those who don't like fan service stay away from these kinds of shows, and if ya dont, don't come to these sites complaining about it). Funny thing is while wacthing this i really didn't notice the fanservice as much as when i watched Rosario + Vampire. It was ridiculas the way they basically threw a panty shot in almost every seen just to show their panties. Now don't get me wrong i don't mind fanservie so long as it adds some humor but to show panties for the sake of showing them gets old mighty fast. Anyway i really didn't think the fanservice was all that bad in this series.
  All the girls are really quite special in their own way,. Normally i just faver 1 or 2 chars in a series but i liked all the chars even the stuck up girl wich i normaly detest. Our lead lady Miyafuji really is the heart of the show.
  Funimation did a excellant job in dubing this so no complaints their. The video both Standard and BR was great no issues unlike some of the other BR combo's ive seen them release.
  So if ya wanna kill a few hours with some good laugh's definatley get this 1, i have ordered the 2nd season and cant wait for the movie to come out heres hopeing.

4294873,4,B0049TC8BC,"You can't get away with talking about Strike Witches without talking about the fan service.  It is everywhere, and arguably it is the focus of the show.  I do not mind fan service, but if it certainly not enough to make me watch a show.  Thankfully, GONZO studios realized this and added things like plot, and character development, and exciting battle sequences to the fan service(not to mention a ton of fun historical references).  It is still a fan service show though, with panty shots, nipples, skinship, hinted lesbianism, and plenty of bath scenes.  If those bother you, then this is not the series for you.

What makes the show highly entertaining is the humor, which works(in a world where women don't wear pants, watching a woman try and catch a ride by showing her legs, and the driver not even giving her a second glance is hilarious), the overarching storyline set in an alternate history that is actually interesting, characters who are interesting, and most of all, the battle scenes.  The battle scenes are exciting and well animated, and wonderfully creative at times.  Watching the girls fly around with their oversized guns, desperately battling the Neroi is a blast.  The animation is top notch most of the time(though the CG gets a bit varied away at points).

Both the Japanese and English voice casts are good, the video quality looked good to my eye, the animation was excellent, the extras almost nonexistant as is usual from Funimation.

All in all, a fun if mostly mindless anime series.  Nothing great, nothing that has not been done before, but a very solid release.

And one last note.  I mentioned fun historical references in the opening paragraph.  One example(though from the second season and light novels/manga...but the coolest example): Adolfine Galland, the only woman in the series to wear pants.  She is based on Adolf Galland a WW2 German pilot who was notable in part for not wearing pants while he flew, but instead swimming trunks.",1357776000,,1977,4.874251497005988

4294876,5,B0049TC8BC,"I just recently started watching anime and I had remembered seeing ads for this show a little while back. I was able to first watch this show on Netflix, but it was recently removed. I was able to watch the entire first season, and I have to say, it didn't disappoint.

I am a WWII buff, so seeing an anime that was supposed to be set in WWII sounded very interesting. This isn't really historical fiction; it's basically an alternate take on WWII as a whole. However, the characters themselves are named after WWII fighting aces, which was just the icing on the cake.

The show has a main storyline driving it, but many of the episodes are random and are there for comedic purposes. This, however, did not take away from the show in anyway; I enjoy random hilarity, and this show did it very well.

Overall, I found it to be very entertaining. It isn't for everyone, but I decided to try it and I really liked it. I would recommend it for its comedy and its hilarious, well drawn and well voiced characters.

I do, however, offer this word of caution: The show is full of fan service, and a LOT of it. Even the ads mention nothing about the show's plot; they just talk about how the ladies don't wear pants. I felt the fan service didn't take away from anything, but if you really don't enjoy it, I'd recommend staying clear. Otherwise, give it a shot!

Also, you should probably not watch this anime since you're not going to be familiar with its main selling point. If you don't like insane amounts of fan service, stay away. Period. If it makes you uncomfortable at all, stay far away. For everyone else, please keep reading.

Okay, are you all still here? Good, let's get to work. Strike Witches is set in an alternate timeline of Earth during World War II. Countries have different names (United States of Liberation and such) and magic and witches are common place. A strange alien race of what I can only assume are machines with crystal hearts appear one day and begin destroying the planet. Humanity is slowly pushed back until technology invents the Striker Unit--a pair of airplane leggings that witches slip into and power with their magic. This anime follows the tale of the 501st (NOT Star Wars!) as they defend Brittinia from Neuroi, the alien race (Battle of Britain anyone?).  Yoshika Miafuji--uh, sorry. Sargent Miafuji is the newest member of the 501st and the story follows her through her initial training, bonding with the other witches, and their following battles against the enemies; both obvious and hidden ones. And that's the plot.

The first few episodes are a little slow after the opening battle. It starts with Miafuji being a school girl, then spends another whole episode getting to the base of the witches. These opening episodes are slow going, but once the rest of the cast arrives, the show begins to shine. Each witch is actually named after a real World War II ace from different countries. Germany is special because they get two! Anyway, like I said, once the other girls are introduced, the show picks up. Each girl has her own unique personality, ranging from the shy, quiet one, to the stern, all-business one and her goofball partner, to the rather perverted, trouble-making one. They all play off of each other rather well, and I found myself laughing with amusement on several occasions. The action scenes, though short, are solid and fast-paced.

The English voice actors/actresses all seem to enjoy their roles perfectly. There was only one part where it felt forced, and that was when someone was desperately screaming Miafuji's name. But then, those scenes always feel forced in any anime. The animation itself is rock-solid as far as I'm concerned, and the sounds are spot on. The engines the girls wear sound like engines, the sounds of their flybys are realistic, and each of their machine guns sound different. As in, the MG-42 that the German pilot, Barkhorn, carries sounds different from Yeager's Browning Automatic rifle. Now, I don't know what these guns actually sound like as my experience with weapons does not go beyond video games, but they sounded exactly like they sound in the games. So, good in my book.

Now for the downside. The story in the first season takes a nose-dive in the final two episodes. Episode 11 sets up what could be an interesting conspiracy (maybe the Neuroi aren't as evil as we first thought and the real enemy is within the army), but then the last two episodes rush through this too much to do anything with it. I don't want to spoil anything, but I was left with a lot of questions. Not cliffhanger questions, but little things like, ""How did they get their hands on that?"" and ""Why did she beat up only the one guy?"" and ""Why did the Neuroi do that?"" The overall storyline is resolved, but it's resolved a little too quickly and will leave you with questions if, like me, you like details being explained. If you don't, you have nothing to worry about.
Another thing that's on the downside is that not once does it ever explain why the girls don't wear pants. They either wear tights, or just panties. And I mean ALL the girls, even ones not in the witches. The only two girls who I saw fully clothed were Miafuji's Grandmother and mother. This bothered me to no end. I came up with my own theory, but I didn't look it up at first. I kept expecting the anime to explain it. Finally, after about eight episodes, I gave up and looked it up. It's what I thought: The engines they wear are powered by magic. As such, they need to be against the skin to get full power. Thin tights are fine, but wearing actual pants messes up the magic power. Since Neuroi can attack at any moment, witches need to be ready to go right away, so they simply don't wear pants (there's even an episode where one of them takes off in her bathing suit because she was tanning when the attack started). And the reason all the other girls don't wear pants? Witches are so respected for their skill, that girls started copying the look until it just because a standard fashion. I thought this rather odd, as the men would probably be constantly getting nose bleeds (an anime thing), but think about it: If every girl started wearing a bikini, at first it would be exciting, but after several years, guys just wouldn't take notice anymore. That's what happened here. This is the reasoning behind a major factor in the series and it's never explained in the anime. Bad form there and because of these two things, it loses a star.

Alright, let's talk about the elephant in the room. As I said, this show is filled with fan service. There are plenty of shots of the girls' underwear and several scenes where they're taking baths together, so there's nudity as well. There's even an episode centered completely around a panty thief--which I found utterly hilarious. Miafuji, while she looks like she's 10 or 11, is actually 14 and turns 15. This is common in Japanese anime and manga and is called a Lolita character. Francesca actually is 12 though. So yes, if this fan service makes you uncomfortable, this isn't for you.
However, the fan service is very rarely called attention to. What I mean is, yes, the girls will fly right in front of the camera at just the right angel, but the characters themselves rarely acknowledge it. It's not like, say, Negima or Omari Himari, where characters are embarrassed about their situation or showing off their stuff. It's just there for the most part until it feels 'natural' and you don't even notice it anymore. There are scenes where it is called to attention--Barkhorn finds her wingman, Erica Hartmann, asleep on the floor and is embarrassed because Hartmann doesn't have panties on, Francesca Lucchini likes to compare the girls' breasts and finds comfort in Yeager's, and Miafuji sometimes finds herself staring at the others because she wishes hers were bigger--but these scene are few and far between. I want to say they almost feel out of place, but not quite. So, for all of you out there hoping for constant groping and accidental falling scenes, this show is not going to have them. Surprising, I know.

This is a fun little anime, but it's not going to appeal to everyone--just look at some of the one-star reviews. I've yet to meet someone who admits to liking it without getting a little embarrassed in the process. The sound and voice work is solid, and even though the finale trips and doesn't quite recover fully, it doesn't ruin the show. It also ends with a hook for season 2, which I should be getting in a few days. If you can accept the show for what it is and get past the fact that you will see panty shots (or if that's the main reason you're buying this), then there's enough in this show for a fun view experience.",1349654400,3,7722,4.636230825420014

We were excited for the wartime setting and the premise of the step-in propellor stockings, but when the camera began panning over cameltoe and barely masked genitalia of these young girls, we had to stop watching. ""Fan-serving"" is a word that gets tossed around on here a lot.

What makes a good fluff show? Likeable characters, Brainless plot but something you still follow and is coherent, doesn't try anything new yet has something unique. Good Art factors in, and character design
you need good character design and it's not fluff with out pointless nudity. This show has all that plus a few fetishes that might be fufilled, This can appeal to Weeaboos, Single pervs like myself or just casual anime fans.

But if you want something deep look elsewhere this is a show you just turn your brain off and watch and before you know it the 5 hours pass by fast.

so the only ones who could be in the team are teens and younger....this is most of the witch teams...the main character is like 11 or something...and almost ALL the off time they are either naked or in almost sensual situations

But it isn't just action, there is also comedy and some sweet fanservice. And thank god for Funimation as it contains uncut nudity. Awesome fanservice awaits in some episodes where the girls' private areas are exploited in the glorious open for all dirty minds to see!  Anyways just wanted to make a short review. I'm pretty sure you'll find better reviews of this awesome series, but I just wanted to give my 2 cents.

4294892,4,B0049TC8BC,"After watching Battlestar Galactica (great but unremittingly grim), Speedgrapher (very good but unremittingly grim) I decided I wanted to watch something a little lighter in tone. I'd been waiting for this to be re-released and ordred it. Amazon did their usual great job of delivery and this was soon in my hands. It's a hoot.
The plot concerns a young witch who joins a squadron of girls fighting against an evil enemy called the neuroi. They don't wear trousers for some reason which gives a lot of the fan service. The first few episodes add some descriptive metaphorical flesh to the characters before the main plot kicks in. An evil airforce general wants the witches gone and replaces them with a prototype wonder machine. The predictable chaos ensues and the 501st squadron witches ride to the rescue. Happy ending, bad guys vanquised, etc, etc.
When I review things I prefer not to spoil the plot too much, after all why would you then watc h it. This was fun in a light hearted way. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to engage and the character interactions both support the plot and add to it as well. There's some inevitable fan service but nothing too over the top.

4294893,4,B0049TC8BC,"The anime is very fun to watch and has many good scenes as well as very good historical references. Each episode, aside from episode 7, develops each character and gives the viewer a good look into the lives of the characters. The designs of the leg-wear (striker units( that the girls wear are based off of the propeller planes of the time. Guns used by each character is representative of their home country, even if the names are changed, including various light machine guns such as the MG42 (aka Hitler's Buzzsaw), the American derived version, as well as various Japanese and British machine guns and sniping rifles. A slight disappointment with the sniper rifle since there are several guns of the period with magnifying scopes, although the caliber was not as high as the gun in the show.

A very strict warning to those with sensitive ideology, due to the difference in culture and public acceptability, this anime may NOT be fore you. Strike Witches offers a LOT of fan service and non-sexual nudity. It also touches upon the Loli aspect, so if you are a type of person to judge primarily on that aspect, turn away now. There is a reason for the MA rating...

The anime was a bit short with 12 episodes and many holes are left un-answered. It should also be noted that this IS the censored version, so there are conveniently placed soup bubbles and steam clouds. Although at the end, it does hint greatly at a season two, however, it does not hint weather or not the current characters will make a return or now if season two is produced.",1312156800,3,1548,4.605072463768116
4294894,5,B0049TC8BC,"Strike Witches is a story based on Earth(Naturally) about a group of witches known as the Strike Witches that defend their planet/homes from a mysterous enemy called the Neuroi.

The focus is on a young girl called Yoshika Miyafuji, an average normal girl who one day learns of her fathers past and is drawn into the conflict with the Neuroi, she comes accross as a somewhat shy girl but at the same time she has the detirmation to help others around her and better herself, and as shown in this series she demonstrates this by showing courage and conviction in the face of the enemy.

This is mostly a slice of life story centering on the various girls that serve in the Strike Witches, that also contains some drama and some mild character conflict between the battles, and the team bonding that occurs during them.

Initially one might look at the cover thinking that this series is perverted, it can be but it simply isn't the direction the show takes, the characters don't wear pants but its never forced in your faces, from the moment you encounter the witches it feels more natural when watching, and never becomes an issue.

The fun part in this series is that although the Neuroi battling is deadly serious, the show never really takes itself that seriously, the characters bond, have fun, and act as an organized group of individuals when they need to be, and if you're a fan of girl power, this show has loads of it.

It's worth noting this series does have nudity and an episode solely focusing on someone stealing Yoshikas pants, but its never really that perverted, if you can get over some of the adult humor, it comes accross as a funny, if not entertaining piece of material.

I fully reccomend Strike Witches for anyone looking to kill a few hours, the show is 12 episodes long, has a very entertaining English dub, and is currently on sale a very good price on here.

You need to watch. This is one gem of a series that must not be avoided, get over some your misgivings and you'l have fun, I promise.",1308355200,37,2020,4.532967032967033
4294895,3,B0049TC8BC,"I watched this series as it was broadcasted on tv a few years back

For starters, this anime takes place in an alternate universe, the setting is world war 2, however there are no nazis, the enemies are aliens called Neuroi and girls with magical powers exist, they are called witches, well with that established lets get on with the review.

In the year 1939, an alien race suddenly appears over the skies of europe, humanity tries to strike at the alien menace, however our weaponry has no effect on them, the enemy starts seizing our territory bringing death and destruction to our world, fortunately scientist Dr. Miyafuji develops the striker units, these strikers units powered by magic, enable girls to fly in the sky and project energy field, enabling them to find the enemy weak spot and destroy them, meet Yoshika is a young girl who 1 day receives a letter from her father (who is in the military and was presumed dead) with the help of fellow compatriot Mio Sakamoto, she embarks with her on a journey to find out what happened to her dad, however being on a military ships proves to be no easy ride as the journey is long as soon discovers how dangerous the enemy really is.

The series premise is actually cool, pantless girls flying that represent WW2 era ace fighter pilots flying around saving the world and having lots of fun while doing it.

The series is mostly a comedy, is has a bit of drama here and there and its littered with fan service, since the witches don't wear pants ""they don't exist in their alternate universe"" you are practically watching panty shots 90% of the time, this is a series of cute girls doing cute things with some action thrown in, if you don't mind this types of series then this series is really good, its got simple good fun as long as you don't mind the excesive fanservice.

The anime has alot of WW2 references, from the forms of enemy ships, the sound of the motors of each striker unit, the motors and even the paint jobs, to people like Winston Churchill, and WW2 fighter pilots, the later all turned into girl fighter pilots.

The anime is not story heavy, its a character driven anime, meaning that the focus of each episode is on the witches themselves and not the war, though there is fighting, its usually just to remind you there's a war going on.

Like I mentioned the anime is good if you like simple slice of life/comedy and don't mind fanservice as this is what its mostly shown, I give it a 3 stars out of 5 because, its not a great anime but its not bad either, just watch it for fun though I wouldnt recommend watching it with other people around as it contains boobies, which Yoshika approves.

Bar this misconception I also had the worry that it was made just to please the lolicon fan base in japan but I was wrong, if you can look past the pretty harmless as it turns out, fan service, than the show is a quite enjoyable one.

If you watch the episodes, you may notice that there isn't much in they way of story, but SW makes up for it in what it brings in character development with a good 8 episodes focusing on the girls of the 501st + 2 episodes to set up the story and 2 episodes to end the season. I didn't enjoy the first 2 episodes because I am not a big fan of Yoshika (the main character ) but after this, strike witches become entirely enjoyable.

I must apologize this review has kind of gone round in circles but I would recommend any anime fan that they should add this to there collection. I know of several people who normally dislike moe shows but where pretty hooked by SW.

I also liked the packaging, it as very nice, all eleven girls get there place somewhere on the boxes and on the inside of the dvd boxes is a character sheet of who the eleven girls are, what striker unit they wear, panties, and what animal there accosiated with, finally I liked the sow on patch that comes with SW, its nicely made and look very good, I shall need to find a good use for it, I love it.",1285372800,5,1534,4.1375838926174495
