8483571,2,B005QPOB0O,I took a cHanceville on this show and found it to be a huge disappointment. Not one of Alice Faye best. I will never watch this one a 2nd time.,1486771200,,143,3.8
8483572,5,B005QPOB0O,"If you know Hello, Frisco, Hello, you've seen the story of a producer who rises in his field, becomes perhaps too ambitious, marries into high society, and fails and is rescued by the woman who loves him. That's 1943. Hello, Frisco is a rewrite of King of Burlesque. Same general plot, same Alice Faye and Jack Oakie. The plot exposition in King of Burlesque is a bit rougher, but the show Baxter puts on at the end is wonderful with its singing (including a song by Fats Waller) and tap dancing.",1475280000,,496,4.461538461538462

8483574,4,B005QPOB0O,"Years ago, as part of a Fats Waller PBS special, I saw a film clip of a young girl tap-dancing alongside Fats as he sang ""I've Got My Fingers Crossed."" I did not know what movie it was at the time, but was anxious to find out who the diminutive tapper was. In 2004, when I purchased the BMG/RCA/Bluebird CD/DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fats-Waller-The-Centennial-Collection/dp/B0001VOHGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fats Waller: The Centennial Collection</a>, the bonus DVD had the same film clip, and it was only then that I found out it was from this movie, 1936's KING OF BURLESQUE. Thanks to Fox Archives, I now own the entire movie, and it is a fun watch, featuring Fats, Alice Faye, Warner Baxter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/42nd-Street/dp/B00004TZRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">42nd Street</a>), Jack Oakie (Shirley Temple's last Fox film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-People/dp/B00133QNUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young People</a>), and the diminutive tapper, whose name is Dixie Dunbar.

While the plot is typically thin, the music and dance numbers are very entertaining. There are quite a few of them, including one short number from The Paxton Sisters, who come out and tap to ONE CHORUS of ""Sweet Georgia Brown."" What's the point? ""I've Got My Fingers Crossed"" appears toward the end of the film; it starts out with Dixie Dunbar singing and tapping with male chorus boys, and then the set revolves to reveal Fats doing his bit, with Dixie doing her tap solo alongside Fats; her solo continues after Fats is done, with the male chorus boys briefly reappearing near the end.

For an 80-year-old movie, picture and sound quality are superb. Burlesque in the 1930s was an offshoot of vaudeville, and was not the vulgar X-rated type of ""entertainment"" marketed under that label today.

Okay, Fox Archives: how about releasing Glenn Miller's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sun-Valley-Serenade/dp/B00URVIVVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sun Valley Serenade</a>&nbsp;and Shirley Temple's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poor-Little-Rich-Girl/dp/B00DMEBBCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poor Little Rich Girl</a>&nbsp;on U.S.-formatted DVDs? I made a homemade DVD copy of POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL last Christmas; the Fox-owned over-the-air digital channel, MOVIES!, had ""A Very Shirley Christmas"" Temple movie marathon on Christmas Day; that night, I recorded the colorized broadcast of POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL. It's better than nothing; my old B&W VHS tape is copy-protected and could not be copied to a blank DVD.",1427500800,2,2948,6.791005291005291
8483575,5,B005QPOB0O,"Highly entertaining FOX musical from the 1930's.  Spirited performances by Alice Faye, Warner Baxter and Jack Oakie.  Faye gets to sing some good tunes including the wonderful SHOOTING HIGH.  This is another DVD-R release but the quality looks better than average.  Remade in the 1940s as HELLO, FRISCO HELLO again with Alice Faye.  If you love musicals you will be happy with owning this one.  And was there anyone ever like Alice Faye.",1425168000,,437,4.917808219178082
8483576,5,B005QPOB0O,"Another early Fox musical that zips along with great musical numbers.  Alice Faye, who became the popular music composers' favorite song plugger, puts her songs over with her usual expertise (Whose Big Baby Are You?, I'm Shooting High, I Love to Ride the Horses).  You'll enjoy Fats Waller in the delightful musical number ""I've Got My Fingers Crossed,""  and Kenny Baker with his beautiful tenor voice singing ""Lovely Lady.""  Warner Baxter gives a very warm performance as the owner of the show, and Jack Oakie is his usual delightful self.  A good back stage musical which benefits from Fox's superior editing.  The print is clean with good contrasts.",1423872000,7,652,4.9907407407407405
8483577,5,B005QPOB0O,"I purchased this DVD because I love Alice Faye in any film. I knew the songs from this film for many years because I've several CDs featuring her film music but I had never seen this film (TCM rarely plays FOX films and I don't have the the Fox Movie Channel where I live).

About 1/3 of the way through the film, I suddenly realized that this was an earlier version of ""Hello, Frisco, Hello"" (which I love!), that also starred Alice Faye and Jack Oakie. The King of Burlesque has a current day Broadway setting (the 1930s), Hello, Frisco, Hello has a ""Gay '90s"" San Francisco setting. The plot is virtually the same - but who cares? It's Alice Faye!

King of Burlesque is Alice in her Jean Harlow look alike phase. Jack Oakie is considerably thinner and younger than his later films. Film fans will
recognized Warner Baxter from the classic ""42nd Street"". Fox contract players abound including pint-sized Dixie Dunbar and Aline Judge. Look for jazz legend Fats Waller as the elevator man turned show-saver and a very young Kenny Baker (who most notably, was in ""The Harvey Girls"").

As with all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series, it's just the film - no extras, no chapters, no fancy inserts, no commentaries - just the film. Hey, it's better than nothing.",1422057600,11,1269,4.581497797356828
8483578,5,B005QPOB0O,I really enjoyed this B&W musical.  The male lead is a go-getter.  Alice Faye (Betty Grable of her era) is in love this this guy.  He marries a very rich woman to get ahead since his goal is to move from burlesque to Broadway.  Watch the movie to see what happens.,1401062400,2,264,4.117647058823529
