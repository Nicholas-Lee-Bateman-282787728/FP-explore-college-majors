8166148,5,B000M341U0,"Great cop flick shot entirely in Pittsburgh (back cover of DVD says Los Angeles), Suzanne Pleshette plays the tough C.O. of
the worst precent in the city, the cops are out of control as most of the people in the southeast district, look for Danny Aiello
in a small role as the Chief of Police.",1498608000,,293,4.345454545454546

8166153,4,B000M341U0,"I thought Suzanne Pleshette was just wonderful in this movie.  She is a Police Captain and she is assigned to clean up a station with a lot of corrupt cops.  She is tough, but fair.  Suzanne Pleshette is so pretty and classy, I really enjoyed it.  This role just fits her so well.  Even though she had to be hard as nails at times, she still had a sense of humor and she really became emotional at times due to the sadness of so much corruption.  It is an excellent movie, the only thing I would have liked to have seen more of is her husband.  I wish they would have spent a little more time on her relationship with him, but other than that it was great.  If you are a fan of Suzanne Pleshette's this is a must have.",979862400,11,718,4.042553191489362
