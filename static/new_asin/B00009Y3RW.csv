1896705,5,B00009Y3RW,"This is an awesome DVD box-set of Will and Grace. Being the first TV show that I bought on DVD, it left a very good impression on me. The four main characters (Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen)are wonderfully written, each one having his or her own personality and humor. The actors themselves are wonderful to watch. Eric, Debra, Sean, and Megan is the perfect ensemble for a comedy series.
  This season has many memorable moments, but in my opinion, the most memorable is the introduction of ""Just Jack"", the title of Jack's performance. Jack is definetly my most favorite character in this show. I can't wait for season 2 on DVD.",1060905600,,629,4.657657657657658

It sure whisks you down memory lane when you see these actors in their youth.  Trust me, this DVD collection is superior!",1060646400,47,2002,4.6543909348441925
1896707,5,B00009Y3RW,"What can I say about this show other than it's the best comedy on TV right now. I absolutely love this show. The cast works so well together. It's like you know they all love and adore each other. Whether it's Jack and Karen cutting up, Rosairo and Kare's fights, Grace's hideous outfits-honey what's this, or Will and Grace always being around for each other. You won't want to miss getting this Will and Grace collectors item. No matter what kind of day your having, as soon as you pop this in, you will end up leaving with a smile.",1060387200,2,534,4.35
1896708,5,B00009Y3RW,"Grace, what's with the outfit, you look like a crazed housewife from one of the square states!....I can't believe how great this show is--and to have it on DVD!!  I got it as a gift from NBC.com--I would wait and buy it on amazon, it's much cheaper!!  Not only do you get all of the first season episodes--but the ""themed featurettes"" special feature is to die for.  It's a series of 8 montages of clips from the first season grouped into different categories.  It's almost as much fun watching these as it is watching each of the epidodes.
It's also GREAT to have W&G and not have to wait for commercials!  The shows are the perfect length for when you are having a bite to eat but don't want to get hooked on whatever happens to be on cable.  But beware!  The first season is super addictive!
Things to look forward to:  the legendary first meeting of Jack and Karen (where they touch tummies for the first time ""I had no idea you'd be so--""kitten-with-a-whip""  ""Shoes?  Chanel.  Fabulous!  I know!""); Rosario's first epidsode; the unveiling of ""Just Jack""; Molly Shannon's first turn as the crazy luna-chick ""Val"" (""You funny lady--and you gay fella!""); the fantastic episode where the group goes camping (""I don't know Will, at night I like to ""spramp"" a li'l gardenia on for Stan...""); Debbie Reynolds' debut; the list goes on and on.
Even though this show is in syndication, it's a must have on DVD.  You can pick and choose when and how you want to laugh your butt off!!",1058832000,9,1477,4.549242424242424
1896709,5,B00009Y3RW,"In 1998, a new comedy called ""Will & Grace"" made its official debut on US comedy channel NBC. The series was widely talked about. I live in the UK, and Will & Grace has only been on our television screens for little over two years, but - as in America - the show has made a huge impact and formed huge fanclubs amongst both the gay and straight communities. Seasons 1 and 2 have been available in the UK for around a year, so I think it's about time the show is released on DVD in America!

Will and Grace are best friends who are both very close. Everything about their friendship is perfect for them to be a romantic couple, except for one problem - while Grace is straight, Will is gay. Will Truman (Eric McCormack) is a supercool lawyer who loves Grace as a friend, but nothing more. He is a rather strange character, but seems very grounded and comfortable with his sexuality. Grace Adler (Debra Messing) is a sassy, smart and successful interior designer. She is very dedicated and disciplined when it comes to her professional life, but her personal life isn't nearly so together, and Will is her stabilising force. She's a little neurotic, and she knows Will is the only person who understands her and can help her put things into perspective. Besides this, Grace is also a lot of fun, and her humour helps balance Will's more serious personality.

Will and Grace also have to cope with their two long time friends, Jack and Karen. Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) is a jobless and very hyper camp gay guy. He is highly neurotic, extremely outspoken, a little bitter, maybe even borderline obsessive-compulsive. However, underneath all that, he is a caring soul and a good friend to Will. Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) plays Grace's socialite assistant. Karen is always confident that her way is the right way, and that she gives brilliant advice. She is so happy just being who she is, and who she is so completely inappropriate that it can't really be fathomed.

With the first episode of Season 1, ""Pilot (Love And Marriage),"" Grace is preparing to finish with her slob of a boyfriend Danny, but he proposes! The conclusion to whether or not Grace goes through with it is hilarious, and it fits in perfectly with the follow-up episode, ""A New Lease On Life."" Grace is looking for apartments, but puts forth an idea to move in with Will. In ""Head Case,"" Grace comes up with an idea to expand Will's two bathrooms, but this idea soon turns into a living nightmare! In ""Between A Rock And Harlin's Place,"" Jack is rehearsing for his one-man play Just Jack! Karen offers her advice in a hilarious dance scene, while Will and Grace have serious issues about a client who is looking for a new apartment.

In ""Boo! Humbug,"" Karen reluctantly agrees to storm the streets on Halloween with Jack, but she ends up having much more fun than him with a group of Drag Queens! In ""William Tell,"" Jack lets slip to Grace about a guy that Will had an affair with a guy when he was in a long-term relationship with Michael. In ""Where There's A Will, There's No Way,"" Jack is in serious trouble. He has forgotten to pay his taxes and now his gym membership is under threat! In ""The Buying Game,"" Grace wants to buy her studio, but things turn sour when Will intervenes. Meanwhile, Jack is finding his massage training a bit too hands on with Karen. In ""The Truth About Will And Dogs,"" Will becomes obsessed with a pet dog. In ""The Big Vent,"" Jack is freaking out because Karen says his new play stinks. Meanwhile, Will and Grace are totally obsessed with the interesting conversations from the apartment below that they can hear through their heating vent. In ""Will On Ice,"" Jack and Karen strike up an unlikely friendship when discussing ice skaters, while Will's birthday is set to turn out badly again - and he can't even get a cowboy cake!

In ""My Fair Maid-y,"" Grace is freaking out thinking that she has lost all creative inspiration she ever had for interior designing. It's not long before Will's cleaning lady is claimed as Grace's saviour. In ""The Unsinkable Mommy Adler,"" Grace's mother shows up with an outrageous suggestion that Will and Grace should get married! In ""Big Brother Is Coming Part 1,"" Grace is trying to re-unite Will with his brother who cut him out of his life years ago. In ""Big Brother Is Coming Part 2,"" Grace appear to have made a mistake in her attempts to re-unite Will with his brother. In ""Yours, Mine Or Ours,"" Will and Grace argue over a guy who has separately invited them both to dinner.

In ""Secrets And Lays,"" the whole four go to stay in a log cabin for a weekend. Grace sets it up as a solution for Will's 'Split With Michael' Anniversary, but a blast from the past threatens to blow her cover. In ""Grace Replaced,"" Will is off seeing another woman while Grace is extremely busy. Is Grace a little jealous? In ""Will Works Out,"" Jack joins Will's gym but this leads to all sorts of problems for Will and his reputation with clients who also go to his gym. In ""Saving Grace,"" Grace potentially lands a huge deal with a male client, but Will has to go out with him for Grace to be successful in her deal. In ""Alley Cats,"" Will and Grace have to curb their competitive streaks when they stand to lose their friends, whilst Jack is performing CPR on Karen.

Will & Grace is a fairly new comedy in the UK, and its popularity is just soaring, and we're only on Season 3! The show has longevity, and that's what will make it one of the most popular sitcoms in history. Will's crazy moments, Grace's wacky situations, Jack's flamboyant attitude and Karen's hilarious one-liners are all in this collection for you to treasure forever.

1896710,5,B00009Y3RW,"This show is just the best and my absolute favorite. Season one kicked off so well in Europe, that ever since then I'm hooked! I never can get enough of it! I hope that all the other seasons will be released on DVD as well. This show can be watched over and over again thanks to Jack, Karen, Will, and Grace. Great actors with an enormous amount of talent that deserve to be recognized..they make you laugh and that's the greatest thing in life!!!",1056672000,6,447,4.333333333333333
1896711,5,B00009Y3RW,"i have waited for a long time to finally get this series on dvd.  granted i am writing a review based on dvds i have not even seen yet, but i have so much faith in this show that i already know that the set will be awesome.  for me this is the funniest show on television right now.  all four of the major characters feed off of each other perfectly.  notice how all the characters have special relationships with each other and how each one is unique.  of course you have the will and grace relationship which seems to be the traditional gay guy straight girl relationship.  then youhave will and jack which also seems like the typical gay guy and gay guy relationship.  will and karen are hilarious together with their constant insults towards each other, these scenes are side splitting.  then there is the karen and grace relationship which works so well also, and the reason being because that type of friendship doesn't really make a lot of sense but still seems to work.  grace and jack's relationship is also quite funny because jack always seems to be making fun of grace in one way or another.  but the funniest relationship in the show is found between jack and karen.  the first time the two of them meet is classic.  but it is also important to remeber that this is an ensemble cast and that as a whole they work perfectly together.  three out of the four actors have not won emmys for nothing and the show has not won best comedy at the emmys for nothing either.  the show has earned them and well deserves them also.  i will be the first in line to buy this set of dvds and i know that i will not be disappointed.  i really look forward to seeing the show without commercials because those are always such a drag.  so it is about time that this quality show comes to dvd and i cant wait for the rest of the seasons to follow close behind.",1056412800,5,1853,4.309248554913295

All the seasons available include syndicated episodes that are cut even more than their DVDs were. What that means is that the episodes are cut to air on other networks to include more commercials. This is not how they originally aired!
Some how long episodes are split into two and are missing footage!
Some episodes are 16x9 and others are 4x3.
What a mess! Don't bother. Even the DVDs are better than these.
For more information about what's cut on the DVD's, check out the W&G wiki page.  This set is even WORSE than the DVD's.

The main four characters (Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen) plus the recurring cast (Rob, Ellen, Rosario, Elliot) really develop chemistry in seasons 2-4. Grace even has a rival named Val (who also appeared on Seinfeld and Scrubs). Then, the show made the mistake of adding Harry Connick Jr's character in season 5. To make matters worse, it completely jumped the shark in the last 3 seasons by adding all of these silly celebrity guest stars like Jennifer Lopez and Janet Jackson.

The first 4 and a 1/2 seasons of Will and Grace were almost as funny as Friends. The rest of the series is pure garbage.",1427587200,,708,4.574803149606299

As for the show itself, I'm slightly bummed. I remember it being MUCH funnier during its original run. Now, it seems to be a gay version of Goldmember from Austin Powers. The punchline to every joke is ""It's funny because I'm gay! Isn't that weird?""",1427068800,,452,4.524390243902439

I really love the interactions between Jack and Karen more than I do that of Will and Grace.  Classic sit com funniness with great writing.  The entire cast is strong and does a great job.  I love how groundbreaking the show was too for introducing the first openly gay title character.  Yes there have been gay characters in tv in the past, but this was the first in your face main character about it.  Such a funny show at the end of the day with tons of rewatchability!.",1408060800,,568,4.30188679245283
1896781,1,B00009Y3RW,"Just a warning for those who have not yet jumped all the way on to the politically-correct band wagon - since nobody else seems to be talking about it.

If you are a serious, practicing Christian, Jew or Muslim, you will most likely find this show to be unusually offensive. Not only does the show include overtly ""gay"" characters (which many shows now do), but the overall theme of every episode I have seen always concerns how various ""gay"" characters chosen lifestyles affect their relationships, and the relationships of everyone around them. There is never more than a two minute break from this constant theme.

Any character in this show who is not happy with the concept of a man/man romantic relationship is always shown to be obviously wrong about those beliefs and usually also has serious personality disorders as well, in order to further discredit the character and his beliefs. There is a happy ending only when that irrational person realizes the error of his/her ways and becomes a member of the ""gay is good"" club, and therefore a better person.

In typical TV studio fashion, the audience is made to feel that the lifestyle of the Hollywood culture is the only ""correct"" one, and the lifestyle of everyone else is backward, outdated or otherwise defective. Shows like this never include a normal likable Christian who is not a liar, pervert, or hypocrite, who does not give in to political pressure to ""accept"" a lifestyle that he/she believes is against nature and is against his/her core beliefs. So much for ""tolerance"" and ""inclusion"".

But, as annoying and one-sided as all the constant ""gay is good"" preaching gets to be, the addition of outright blasphemy accompanied by extra loud fake audience laughter at God's expense is what made me throw my copy in the trash can to burn.",1406937600,2,1803,4.8441558441558445

My partner and I had evening jobs so when we got home we could unwind and watch the series as reruns. However Lifetime did not show them in sequence. We wanted to watch the characters grow throughout the 7 seasons. At the beginning of the series the actors seemed rather stiff and typed cast. Each episode you watch you could see the characters gradually relax in their roles. This is a must have dvd to watch as the characters develop.

1896866,5,B00009Y3RW,"WILL & GRACE, a groundbreaking sitcom, made its debut in 1998.  Why was it groundbreaking?  For starters, it was the first comedic series on network, ""mainstream"" television (NBC) where two of the main characters were openly gay men (Will, played by Eric McCormack and Jack, played by Sean Hayes), and a third character was more than a little ""bi-curious"" (Karen, played by Megan Mullally).  Their antics, adventures and romantic exploits were depicted in a very incidental way.  Homosexuality was significant and was the subject of every episode (for obvious reasons), but the scripts were so openly humorous and intelligent, that the stories could have been about anyone (read: anyone including straight characters!).  This sparklingly witty and unabashedly honest show brought Debra Messing, as Grace, to our attention as a very talented comedianne, with terrific timing and wonderful Newyorkese accent.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot.  I will say that this story opens with Grace (Messing) moving back in with Will (Eric McCormack) after jilting her fiancee at the alter (on account of the fact that he didn't deserve her).  Grace is a very accomplished interior designer and takes in Karen Walker (Mullally) a sickeningly wealthy, perpetually drunk/stoned snob, with a voice that would make Betty Boop sound decidedly mezzo-soprano and sullen, at that.  What's more, her off-the-cuff insults directed at Grace (poking fun at everything from her clothes to her love life), eternally coked up episodes and shamelessly classist, racist, and sexually ambiguous banter make Robin Williams' brand of ""late night"" humor look decidedly clean cut and G-Rated.

What's more, I can't end this review without mentioning Sean Hayes' brand of humor, as Jack McFarland, Will's best friend.  Jack is a ""singer/dancer/choreographer/actor.""  Does he have a real following in NYC, the city that never sleeps?  Not really--um, make that, not at all.  Therefore, he relies on Will, the uber ""well off"" corporate lawyer, to provide for him money for rent, other expenses and anything else he wants.  Hayes is so funny here.  I would call him a fireball performance artist, inspired by every gay/ambiguous icon known to man (Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, Tommy Tune, to name a few).  To call Jack ""flamboyant"" is a grand understatement.  Try, anyone playing off of him and his wild brand of snappy comebacks comes off as understated and pales in comparison to his infectious wisecracks.

This first season was a grand introduction to a very funny show that had very memorable episodes, that first year.  I highly reccomend it!",1181606400,3,2624,5.2023809523809526
1896867,5,B00009Y3RW,"My response to the first season of Will & Grace is this:

My life BEGAN when I started to watch W&G! It is the most satyrical, masterful, and edgy (in the sense that it raises the proletariat to the status of HUMAN) sitcom in the history of the world (To put it in Mel Brooks' terms)!

Grace is engaged to a real jerk, but when that relationship falls apart, she moves in with Will. This is only supposed to be until Grace finds a place of her own, but she and Will end up with each other as permanent roommates. Also in the cast are Jack, Will's flamboyant gay friend and Karen, Graces' secretary/assistant who doesn't really need to work because she married money several times. Sean Hayes plays Jack and he dose a great job and I think is one of the funniest charactors/actors to be on tv. Megan Mullally plays Karen who also is one of the best charactors/actresses to hit tv.

No, it's not that I object to. I don't care what the characters are or do to one another - as long as it's funny. And this is where Will And Grace falls at the very first hurdle - it's JUST. NOT. FUNNY.

So the two males are gay. Hurrah. No problem. Question - why do gay people HAVE to be represented as screaming queens, (Jack), screeching and bitching and being quite simply the worst character in sitcom history.

Then there's Karen, who's ""character"" is based purely on the fact she has a squeaky voice. Oh HA HA HA HA HA. And of course, as the series went on, that voice just got more and more high pitched until only dogs could hear it.

Of course, every simpleton loves this show, slapping their thighs at every stupid plot device, every tired, shameless mugging to the camera and irritating vocal tick.

This isn't ""cutting edge"" television. It's not breaking any boundaries - it merely shows gay people as DIFFERENT to straights. They're not just everyday people, noooo, they're camp as a row of tents, shouting and falling over and yelping and generally being really, really, REALLY annoying.

Is this the sort of message we want to get across? Of course it isn't. Don't be fooled.",1123718400,11,1366,4.555102040816327
1896892,5,B00009Y3RW,"Premiering in the Fall of 1998, Will & Grace has become one of the most celebrated shows of its time. Nominated for 49 Emmys, and winner of 12 (including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000), the show follows the lives of two best friends who live together. With a plethora of other award nominations - 24 Golden Globes, 14 SAG Awards, and 6 People's Choice Awards, Will & Grace continues to light up the small screen with its unique brand of comic humor and groundbreaking sitcom format...

Debra Messing stars in the role of Grace Adler, a straight interior designer who moves into an apartment with her best friend Will (Eric McCormack). Friends since college, Will is a successful lawyer who also happens to be gay (thus, keeping their relationship from becoming a permanent romantic one). Having dated before Will came out of the closet, the two maintain a more intimate relationship than mere casual friends. The comic sequences involving the two are complimented by Will's flamboyantly gay friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) and Grace's sarcastic, alcoholic assistant Karen Walker (Megan Mullally)...

The Will & Grace (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Love and Marriage"" in which Grace, having received an unexpected marriage proposal from her boyfriend, decides to get married. Meanwhile, Will believes the marriage will be a mistake, and he decides to risk his friendship with Grace in order to tell her... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Between a Rock and Harlin's Place"" in which Grace decorates Harlin's apartment, but gets carried away with a cowboy theme, and ""The Big Vent"" in which Will and Grace begin listening to their neighbors through a vent in their own apartment...

Will & Grace has a group of co-stars that could not be any better. The chemistry between Will & Grace and Jack & Karen is off the charts. And Jack is, well, Just Jack, to quote his one-man show. This character is hilarious. It will be sad if this character doesn't resurface after this show's run.

Despite decent at best interviews and well-done (and well-suited for the show) themed featurettes, this CD-set is missing some extras! Come on now, where are the bloopers????

1896895,5,B00009Y3RW,"WILL AND GRACE is probably one of the most refreshingly-hilarious sitcoms to come along in recent years.  The ensemble cast is perfect, the writing pin-sharp and storylines ideal.  The first season of the show still holds up pretty well (though the show only started to hit it's stride midway through season two).

""Pilot"" - Will (Eric McCormack) has arranged for his friend Jack (Sean Hayes) to move into his apartment, until his best friend Grace (Debra Messing) has a bitter breakup with her boyfriend.

""A New Lease on Life"" - Will tries to discourage Grace from moving in with him, whilst crazy Jack is slowly driving Will `round the bend.

""Head Case"" - Tensions run on high in the Will-Grace apartment when Grace decides they need to renovate the bathroom.

""Between a Rock and Harlin's Place"" - Grace accepts the offer to revovate Harlin's (Gary Grubbs) apartment, which infuriates Will.

""Boo Humbug"" - Will and Grace have settled down to spend Halloween night watching a series of Ingmar Bergman films when Harlin is called away and needs them to babysit.

""William, Tell"" - Grace becomes intrigued when Jack lets slip that Will had a secret affair last summer.

""Where There's a Will, There's No Way"" - Grace blames her failing lovelife on Will's influence.

""The Buying Game"" - Grace has the option of buying her rented studio space, but is shocked by Will's take-no-prisoners approach to deals.

""The Truth About Will and Dogs"" - Grace decides to buy a dog, and Will becomes insane treating the dog like a newborn baby.

""The Big Vent"" - Through an accident, Will and Grace start eavesdropping on the couple in the apartment below.

""Will on Ice"" - It's Will's birthday but Grace and Jack want to go see an iceskating show.  Foolishly Will decides to tag along...

""My Fair Maid-y"" - Grace is suffering major creative-block and the apartment is a shambles so Will employs a rather unorthodox maid (Wendie Jo Sperber).

""The Unsinkable Mommy Adler"" - Grace's mother (Debbie Reynolds) comes to visit and Will drops a crushing bombshell on Grace.

""Big Brother is Coming (Part 1)"" - It's Jack's 29th birthday and Karen (Megan Mullally) is planning a huge bash for her `poodle', complete with a 5-second `appearance' of Leslie Uggams and Will's estranged brother (John Slattery).

""Big Brother is Coming (Part 2)"" - After the disastrous birthday, Will and Jack lick their wounds.

""Your's, Mine or Our's"" - A good-looking but sexually-ambiguous new tenant moves in, and so do Will and Grace.

""Secrets and Lays"" - Jack, Karen and Grace take Will for a weekend in Vermont to forget the anniversary of his ex-boyfriend.

""Grace Replaced"" - A new neighbour, Val (Molly Shannon) becomes Will's friend and sets about replacing Grace in his life!

""Will Works Out"" - Jack becomes a member at Will's gym, stirring up a lot of feelings about his sexuality.

""Saving Grace"" - In order to land a well-paying design job, Grace has to act like a pimp by arranging a date between Will and her prospective boss.

""Alley Cats"" - Grace's insane compulsion to always be the winner on `Games Night' almost ruins a friendship.

""Object of My Rejection"" - Karen's maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) is about to be deported until Jack offers to marry her.  Grace's ex-boyfriend from Episode One comes back on the scene.

1896897,5,B00009Y3RW,"Welcome to the wacky and wonderful world of Will & Grace!

Will (Erick McCormack), a gay Manhattan lawyer, and his best straight friend Grace (Debra Messing), an interior designer, have been friends forever and share an apartment in New York City. Their love for each other is something that can be regarded as that special unbreakable bond that can - sometimes - be described as a bond stronger than a marriage.

Will's best friend - for fifteen years and counting - Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) is an outrageously gay individual who has been a struggling actor since, well, forever! Jack is totally dependant on Will for financial and emotional stability.

Grace's wacky, pill-popping, high society assistant Karen Walker only works because it makes her seem ""normal"". She (Karen) describes Karen's outrageous remarks towards Grace as ""work"".

Overall, this is the birth of a television classic and one of the most revolutionary sitcoms ever! `Will & Grace' season one is a real gem. You can never experience a great a first season as this! Despite the fact that many people only caught on in season two and three, season one boasts some of the sharpest writing that ever embraced TV! The cast magnificently portrays their characters to the tea! In season one `Will & Grace' was one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the 1990's and the show was nominated for a lot of awards in season one and has won quite a few this season most notably the `People's Choice Award' for favourite new comedy series. Still going strong in the US and around the world. `Will & Grace' is one of those sitcoms that continue to garner praise from both the television industry (peers) as well as awards from around the world.

Season one (and every successive season) has had the same legendary, outstanding director, the one and the only James Burrows. The writers have remained faithful to the show throughout these seven years - thus far - that they have been on television.

And this first season on DVD of Will and Grace is just the thing us fans have been waiting for for a very long time. Will and Grace has the best half hour of television besides ER and FRIENDS (which is no longer in the running) and it shows us that to have a TV show doesn't mean it has to be ""reality"" tv.  The characters of Will and Grace are believable, hilarious, and oh, did I mention hilarious?  But, besides Will and Grace, there is also Jack and Karen.  Karen is the emotionless, rich, loud-mouthed, jewelry flashing, clothing style, etc. DIVA of the series.  She has everything to be absolutely gut-wrenching hilarious.  And Jack is the flamer we all love and adore with all of his different-job-every-week antics and his slapstick personally, how could you not love Jack?  But what makes Will and Grace a top-spot TV show is it's writers and the cast's ability to act and make all of us (the fans) laugh until we cry...it will be a sad event when the series comes to a close, in my opinion, even more so than FRIENDS.

I rate this among the best... and to see it without the commercial breaks is fantastic.  The packaging on this volume is beautiful,  and obviously time was taken to make it attractive and classy... and it shows. The clarity of picture and sound is wonderful.

1896906,4,B00009Y3RW,"I was kind of late to the Will & Grace game, and this set is a perfect was for me to catch up and fill in. The pilot is almost bizarre because it was before they really found their stride, Karen's voice was a lot lower and what was up with Will's hair?!? Debra Messing's Grace is practically a modern-day Lucille Ball, heavy on the physical comedy and facial expressions.

All of the episodes feature the wacky adventures of Will, Grace, Jack and Karen, who all live and, with the exception of Jack, work in New York City. One of my favorite episodes is the one where Grace is being super competitive about games and she and Will end up alienating another couple. Another is the one when Molly Shannon moves into their building and becomes too friendly with Will for Grace's comfort. Of course Jack steals every scene he is in!! The featurettes (greatest bits with a theme) are hilarious!! This set is great way to relax if you've had a tough day.",1082246400,,947,4.442528735632184

And what's not to love about Will & Grace?
* There is the original humor with its brilliant gay undertones (my favorite line ""let's touch stomachs"").
* The unique characters that if taken in isolation would seem a little overdone, but together form a beautiful tapestry of friendship that play off each other's quirks and weaknesses.
* Of course there is the fashion, all the pop culture references, and that warm fuzzy feeling your are left with at the end of an episode knowing you just spend 25 minutes in good company!
I can't wait for the subsequent seasons to be released on DVD and watch the show taken on more substantive issues. But as a first season this is a worthy introduction to a very worthy show!",1081555200,4,916,4.625766871165644

There are so many episodes in this boxed set, and it makes such a difference when there are no ads! :)  It really is good value for money.
My only complaint is that in the first few episodes (I think it's better by the second DVD) the actual quality is really weird - if the camera tracks around a room it's really jerky - like watching a movie over the internet.  Don't get me wrong - it's not really bad, and it does get better, it's just really odd.

1896915,5,B00009Y3RW,"This is a compilation of the first season episodes of the multi Emmy winning hit TV sitcom ""Will And Grace"".  This stars Debra Messing, Eric McCormick, Sean Hayes, and Megan Mullally.  When the first episode aired in 1998, there was no other show like it.  It remains ahead of its time to this day.  Every script forces the audience's laughter to explode line after line.  Its unique storyline and its many surprising events give the audience the unforgettable experiences.  It's great that the producers can create a series dealing with homosexuality, a virtue that many unfortunately do not accept, and add some light to it.  A few years ago, few other projects featured this.
Those who didn't watch the first season will get a chance to see Will and Grace's lonely days before living together, Karen speaking in her low voice, and of course, Jack being Jack.  This features some of the episodes that have influenced many modern day sitcoms and movies.  Such combination makes this compilation worth the buyers' money. Fans of this show should also watch for Season Two to be released in the near future.
****Watch ""Will And Grace"" every Thursday on NBC at 8:00 PM central time.",1067299200,,1180,4.830845771144278

1896929,5,B00009Y3RW,"If you like Friends, you may also like Will and Grace, a cute comedy that has me laughing.  There is Grace, the interior designer, who has a very colorful Jewish family, Then there is Will, who is the nonchalant gay man who does not let his sexualality interfere with his work, Karen ius the rich, indulgent socialite who works with Grace simply to keep her down to earth, which she is not, and Jack is the flamboyant gay man who is very dramatic and theatrical and he is friends with Karen because they have the same characteristics.  Try the first season; it is hysterical.  I personally think it is better than Friends.  You will love it!",1064793600,4,641,4.5

Ever flip through the TV wishing W&G was on?  Now you can just pop it in...commericial free :)
The extras are really....bad.  Who wants to see an interview with the behind the scenes people?  Even the interview with the cast was yawn worthy.  They should have put bloopers, quizes, or some sort of interaction on here.
Is it worth the money?  No.  Go on Ebay and get it for $16.00, that's what I did.  It's worth $16, not $40.",1064534400,13,598,4.230088495575221

This DVD is worth the money, but I do agree with the other reviewers who say that the DVD is lacking in extras. I would have love to have seen bloopers as I'm sure there are many hilarious ones. The featurettes are pretty cool though. The cast interviews are good too. Hopefully Season 2 will have better extras, but overall this is worth the purchase.",1064016000,6,581,4.388888888888889
1896932,5,B00009Y3RW,"Will and Grace is the funniest TV sitcoms on TV.  I only started watching it in the last 2 seasons, and I haven't been able to catch older episodes on syndication, so I went out and bought this DVD boxed set.  And let me tell you, it was the best boxed set I've bought, with Friends: Complete First/ Second/ Third/ and Fourth Season coming in second.  Not one episode on this DVD didn't make me laugh. And the thing is that you could watch it over and over again and still look forward to it because it still makes you laugh.
My only complaint is that this DVD REALLY lacks extras and special features.  The box cleary says ""Loaded with Special Features""... but where'd they go??? Like... there are three interviews, one with the executive producers and creators, one with the director and one with the cast.  And there are 11 themed featurettes... but all it really is are clips from the episodes... so pointless... On the ""Friends"" DVDs... there are quizzes, commentary, music videos, multi-language subtitles etc.
Overall, this DVD was worth it's money.  Even though it lacked extras, I didn't buy it for the extras anyways, so it really doesn't matter.  Go out and buy this now... it's worth every penny!!!",1062460800,11,1210,4.652582159624413
1896933,4,B00009Y3RW,"I have been a fan of ""W&G"" since the day it premiered. Love the show and the interaction between all 4 stars. Alone----they shine with ability and talent. Together they are radiant, hilarious, witty, sincere, and spontaneous. I was thrilled to see the first season available. BUT.....I was expecting more in the way of extras (outakes, interviews, etc)....the section with the interviews is difficult to hear, had to have sound turned up higher for it. I am sure that there are zillions of ""bloopers"" and some should of been instilled in this set. However it is a wonderfully put together set and fun to see the shows with no commercials. Despite the lack of extras I will wait with baited breath for Season 2 to come available.",1062288000,,728,4.74015748031496
1896934,4,B00009Y3RW,"A very funny show in its first very funny season.  Granted, if you watch several episodes back to back the jokes seem a bit repetitive.  After all, what you really get are multiple punchlines of the same joke.  But if watched in moderation they are enjoyable every time.
For a box set release, however, it comes up a bit short.  We do get interviews with the cast, director, and creators.  But one problem with that is the interviewer:  I think he considers this interview to be HIS moment in the spotlight, so he milks it for every comment he can make.  He doesn't really give the cast a chance to shine in the interview.  And truth be told, they don't look too excited about being there anyway.  What might have been better would have been some outtakes and bloopers, as I am SURE they have some great ones.  And what I have always wanted to see was some perspective that the live audience members get to see at the tapings.  Have a video camera follow the audience in from the studio parking lot to the soundstage, through the audience warm-ups, the cast intros, the taping itself, etc.  I have attended 5 sitcom tapings over the years at various studios, and to me that was always at least as fun as the show itself.  You get to see how the permanent and fly sets are arranged with each other, how some of the production aspects work, etc.  That is just my personal wish list for a box set feature, but I think it is a good example of the kind of value-added material we should expect for the hefty price we pay for these TV series box sets, dontcha think?
But I went out and bought the W&G DVD set without hesitation the day it came out and I do enjoy it (especially the lack of commercials).  I just feel we should expect a lot more in the way of bonus features in these pricey box sets.",1061856000,13,1793,4.294642857142857

You could be the straightest person on earth and any one of the four great actors will make you laugh, especially Karen.  Not that she's better than the rest only that her character get to say all the things we'd love to say  to people but never do (she's a NASTY girl).  Let's hope that we don't have to wait until next year for season 2.  P.S. To the writrers if they're reading this, don't expand Jack and Karen's roles, they're only good because you've kept them at bay, keep up the great work.",1061337600,2,638,4.258333333333334
1896936,5,B00009Y3RW,"FINALLY!!!  Its about time that one of the best sitcoms in television history be released on DVD for its growing number of fans.  This tv series ranks with my other comedy favorites (Seinfeld, Frasier and Friends) as some of the best laughs on television.  Sporting the best ensemble cast since Seinfeld, Will and Grace started out of the gate with edgy humor, great writing and built momentum over the first season to become a breakout hit for NBC.  Eric McCormick, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and, my personal favorite, Megan Mullally, make each episode look effortless.  The chemistry between this foursome was instant and only grows stronger with each season.  This dvd set gives us the first 22 episodes of this groundbreaking comedy and introduces us to recurring guests such as SNL's Molly Shannon, as crazy neighbor Val and Debbie Reynolds, in a hilarious turn as Grace's mother.  We also meet, for the first time, Karen's maid played by the very talented Shelly Morrison.  This is a MUST HAVE for any W & G fans.  If you haven't seen the show, this is a great way to start.  The dvd has a few extra features, such as cast interviews and themed featurettes.  I enjoyed the extras but I hope there are more special features in upcoming season dvds.  It would have been nice to see out takes, interviews with guest stars, etc.  This is a great show and well worth adding to your dvd collection.",1061337600,6,1398,4.680327868852459
1896937,5,B00009Y3RW,"Will & Grace debuted in 1998 on NBC. Critics predicted that Will & Grace would run only one season, but America instantly responded to the 30 minute show with comedy packed into each minute. Since 1998, Will & Grace has been running on NBC, and just recently aired it's 100th show. I guess the television critics were wrong about Will & Grace.
  Will & Grace are play by Eric McCormack, and Debra Messing as Grace. Jack (Will's eccentric best friend) is played by award winning Sean Hayes. Grace's inappropriate rich assistant (and friend) is play by Grammy award winner Megan Mullaly. These four core-characters give compelling comedic performaces, and couldn't have been cast more appropriately. Shelley Morrison (who plays Rosario) a fiesty Salvadorian maid (to Karen) is often not mentioned in addition to the four main actors, but Shelley Morrison is a wonderful actress as well, that certainly spices up any comedic scene.
  So, now that you all have the vital facts on the history of Will & Grace. I'll go into some other important details. Will & Grace is often labeled a comedy (and which it is) but Will & Grace occassionally tackles some tough issues (with a twist of course)sexuality acceptance, marriage, commitment, losing loved ones, the discrimination between gays and straight communities, all these have been brought up on Will & Grace more than once. I think that in addition to being a comedy that everybody could seriously learn something from Will & Grace. So, whether or not you're looking to learn a valueable lesson, or just laugh histerically, I reccommend Will & Grace all the way. Do yourself a favor and have this DVD on your shelf somewhere, even if to save it for a rainy day.",1061078400,6,1707,4.855670103092783

There was an absurdly short interview with the cast and nothing that any second rate fan would already know was revealed.  I expected much more from this DVD and I wish I had skipped on ordering it.  With the show in syndication it's not tough to see all the first season episodes on tv, this is why I expected a lot of added extras; without the extras the DVD is a waste of money in my opinion.",1060992000,4,516,3.9902912621359223
