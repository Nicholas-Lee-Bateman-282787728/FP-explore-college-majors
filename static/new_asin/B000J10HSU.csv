8148433,4,B000J10HSU,"This is a pretty good flick and actually seems to be ahead of its time considering it was filmed in 1936.  There is some reference to CSI stuff by comparing fibers from the crime scene to a murder victim's body and clothing.  They also compare blood samples located at the crime scene and the victim.  I did not realize such forensic considerations were being made in 1936.  Also, it appears that drunk driving was as looked down upon then as it is now.  I didn't realize that DUI was even a ""thing"" back then.  Heck, there's even an overshadowing message against snitching in this film.  I would recommend it highly if you have 90 minutes to kill.",1480636800,,648,4.487179487179487

8148439,4,B000J10HSU,"This is a pretty good low budget crime drama from the 1930's.  In this story of the investigation of an insurance fraud ring, the insurance companies and the criminal justice system are actually interested in prosecuting the con artists.  What a difference five or six decades make.  I once investigated such a fraud ring but the only people interested in doing anything were the criminal investigators from a couple of different agencies and the local insurance agents and adjusters.  Our bosses simply didn't care.  The insurance companies took the short view that it was cheaper to pay them than to fight them, never mind the long term costs of such a policy.
The plot and script are logical.  The actors and direction are good.  The picture and sound quality are acceptable for a transfer of a low budget 1936 movie which was not carefully preserved.  I have to wonder at the leader of the gang having the unlikely dual occupations of interior decorator and murderous criminal.  Did the script writer have something against interior decorators?
I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1457654400,,1120,4.883597883597884
8148440,4,B000J10HSU,A good story. 1930s at its best,1429401600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8148441,3,B000J10HSU,"Accident insurance premium costs are sharply rising due to fraud schemes organized by ""Duke"" Trotti (Noel Madison), an oily interior decorator, along with an unscrupulous attorney, Mr. Rusick (John Dilson), who offer generous cash payoffs to bogus victims of rigged ""accidents"", the two knaves supervising an accomplished band of con artists.  A diligent police detective, Sam Belden (Robert Homans), nabs one of these scoundrels in the act of arranging a fake injury incident but, despite the District Attorney's confidence that a conviction will be attained, an assistant D.A. in charge of preparing the filing, Dan Adams (Onslow Stevens) deliberately arranges to lose the case through below standard preparation, because his younger brother, Eddie (Allen Vincent), using a different surname, is the arrestee/defendant, and it appears that the vile gang of scammers will continue to flourish, successfully gathering in more illegitimate proceeds.  Feelings of guilt over his purposefully poor court performance cause Don to resign from his position with the District Attorney's Office, and he hires on with a private insurance firm, Consolidated, with a purpose of exposing and defeating the racketeers, this with assistance from a comely Consolidated clerk (Kay Linaker) who goes undercover in an attempt to entrap the clever swindlers.  At this same time, Eddie decides to quit the racket and takes a wife as well, but Duke does not intend to permit Eddie's survival outside of the gang, and as he is no longer considered trustworthy by the group's members, and since Don does not believe that Eddie's unlawful ways are at an end, the latter's tribulations mount and perilous circumstances are in the offing for both of the brothers.  Efficiently directed by veteran journeyman Phil Rosen, the film follows a fairly original plot theme that focusses upon insurance fraud and that helps in the development of a smartly paced melodrama that offers solid turns from several in the cast, notably Homans, and also Barbara Barondess playing as a new bride hopeful that she may persuade her husband to remain, for the safety of both of them, upon a straight and narrow path.  Reissued in a DVD format, without much needed remastering, by Alpha Home Entertainment, its print has moderate debris issues throughout, while its sound quality is often poor, especially synchronization.  As is its custom, Alpha provides no extras of value, but yet must be complimented for making available such lightly known films as this often pleasing programmer from the mid-1930s.",1211155200,,2559,5.306172839506173
