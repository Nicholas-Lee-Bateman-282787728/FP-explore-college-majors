1981667,5,B00019GH8E,"Late Verdi may be awesome but I've always had a passion for the savage crudity  of his early years and Nabucco satisfies that passion wonderfully. This is the biblical story of the Assyrian kind who defies God and is struck insane. This 1987 production from LaScala is great on all counts. Muti loves this music and throws himself into it with a vengence. Bruson is at the height of his powers. Dhimitrova's part is a killer and contributed to the ending of Verdi's second wife's career.  No such problem for our diva here. Why didn't she have a career this side of the Atlantic? The staging is traditional and the scenery recalls Art Deco. There's really no weakness and the chorus Ah, pensiero which became the unofficial Italian national anthem will melt your heart.",1077753600,53,769,4.731343283582089
1981688,5,B00019GH8E,"I have a hard time finding all those problems other reviewers find. This is a wonderful biblical opera with awesome voices, scenery, costumes and music. I have never heard a voice as spine tingling as Dimitrova...in such a demanding role. The chorus pieces alone are worth the price of admission. This opera is so good that I will probably add the MET version to my library. By the way there is no problem if it does not quite fit history.",1302652800,3,439,4.5
1981689,5,B00019GH8E,"The opera Nabucco is a milestone for Giuseppe Verdi. It was his first hit musical, composed after the death of his son and wife. Symbol of resistance I believe the North of Italy by Austria and certainly stop him and his editor who had a future as a composer. Musically it is a joy to see in opera maturity. But it has the characteristics of genius, especially in the issue coral.
The Scala in Milan is distinguished by the conservatism of their productions. Often up styles is overstated. The Nabucco they agreed more than wrong. Scenarios representing the Babylonian period, light and mingle with appropriate costumes sometimes heavy demai.
Renato Bruson is a baritone with an international reputation. He sang in all the major opera houses of the world, including Brazil. His technique combined with enviable colorful notes made it a central focus in Verdian roles as Falstaff, Macbeth and Nabucco. Interpretation was never his mark, but then it becomes Nabucco. It shows an excellent actor. It incorporates all the feelings and emotions of the character. Your pipeline is strong in the first act, destroys without the slightest compassion the temple of the Jews. The loss of power to the adopted daughter makes him lose lucidity, is troubled, enigmatic, lost. A true Nabucco, voice and interpretation.
Ghena Dimitrova is without doubt one of the greatest sopranos of the late twentieth century. Her Amneris alongside Luciano Pavarotti at La Scala is unforgettable. In this opera has the responsibility for giving life to Abigail. It does this with great skill, surely one of the greatest interpreters of this character. His dark and powerful voice suits the requirements of the score. His performance is flawless scenic, cold, Machiavellian and ruthless to achieve their goals. These are some characteristics of the temperament of that character and very well expressed on stage by Dimitrova. Mais an outstanding performance.
The orchestra of La Scala is unsurpassed when it comes to Verdi. His Italian musicality, combined with a perfect technique and a proper balance in all suits gives us a unique sound. Example for all other orchestras in the world when it comes to Italian opera. The conductor Riccardo Muti's more than proven competence, you know make the most of its orchestra. Movements correct and full knowledge of the score only increase the quality of their interpretations.
A central factor for the successful development of the opera Nabucco is the chorus. Participates actively in all the acts and presents the best-known part of the score, Penseroso Go! Enslaved, humiliated and hopeful, and represent the chorus of La Scala. They sing and act very well, with a unique style. Many of them with the level of soloist. Accompanying the choir bass Paata Burchuladze plays the role of Zachary, leader of the Jews. Deep voice, dark and serious generous. Lend deity your character. Defends his people tooth and nail, makeup and costume perfect.
The image of the dvd is of good quality, nothing exceptional in the case of an analog matrix. The sound is of good quality. You can choose scenes, menu practical and easy to use.
The reader must be wondering why the title? Two versions, two ways. The other way is a dark shot Nabucco in Naples. Hard to imagine how a theater of international fame can go wrong both in a production. Soloists weaknesses of the mountains, Maurizio Fruzoni, Carlo Colombo, and Lauren Flanigan with voices are inadequate. Sometimes ocher, the often opaque. The only one that saves Renato Bruson is still not in their best days. Sings without much inspiration, nothing compared to the Nabucco at La Scala. The governing Paolo Carignani remember a band from the inside. Dull and reading at least one wrong or strange in the score.
The highlights were the sets and costumes, modern, light and beautiful. The choristers are another positive factor, can sing well, even with the intricacies of the soloists. The direction of television errs in many outlets, it shows the essence of the story. Sound and image of that terrible qualidade. Voc like Verdi, who enjoys opera, run this version.
Dvd of Naples is overwhelming evidence that to make good opera soloists need is qualified. It's no good to hit the production and sin in singers, even the papers ""minor"" should be given special attention. We have seen many operas with excellent soloists and bad comprimrios. The merits are with the Scala of Milan, was right on all counts and did a great job. The San Carlo in Nabucco was more confusion than answers.

DUAS VERSES, DOIS CAMINHOS.

  A pera Nabucco  um marco para Giuseppe Verdi. Foi seu primeiro sucesso musical, composta aps a morte de seu filho e esposa. Smbolo da resistncia do julgo do Norte da Itlia pela ustria e a certeza pare ele e seu editor que tinha futuro como compositor. Musicalmente no  um primor como veremos em peras da maturidade. Mas j apresenta caractersticas de genialidade, principalmente no quesito coral.
  O Scala de Milo se notabiliza pelo conservadorismo de suas produes. Muitas vezes at peca pelo exagero. No Nabucco eles acertaram mais que erraram. Cenrios representativos do perodo babilnico, leves e adequados se misturam com figurinos s vezes pesados demai.
  Renato Bruson  um bartono de reputao internacional. Cantou em todos os grandes teatros lricos do mundo, inclusive no Brasil. Sua tcnica invejvel aliada ao colorido das notas centrais fez dele um destaque nos papis verdianos como Falstaff, Macbeth e no Nabucco.  Interpretao nunca foi sua marca, mas nesse Nabucco ele se transforma. Mostra-se um excelente ator. Incorpora todos os sentimentos e emoes do personagem. Seu Nabucco  forte no primeiro ato, destri sem a menor compaixo o templo dos judeus. A perca do poder para a filha adotiva faz ele perder a lucidez, fica conturbado, enigmtico, perdido. Um verdadeiro Nabucco, na voz e na interpretao.
  Ghena Dimitrova  sem dvida um dos maiores sopranos do final do sculo XX. Sua Amneris ao lado de Luciano Pavarotti no Scala  inesquecvel. Nessa pera tem a funo de dar vida a Abigail. O faz com maestria, com certeza uma das maiores interpretes desse personagem. Sua voz escura e potente se adapta as exigncias da partitura. Sua atuao cnica  impecvel, fria, maquiavlica e sem escrpulos para atingir seus objetivos. Essas so algumas caractersticas do temperamento dessa personagem e muito bem expressas no palco por Dimitrova. Mais uma atuao marcante.
  A orquestra do Scala  insupervel em se tratando de Verdi. Sua musicalidade italiana, aliada a uma tcnica perfeita e um conjunto equilibrado em todos os naipes nos proporciona um som nico. Exemplo para todas as outras orquestras do mundo em se tratando de pera italiana. O regente Riccardo Muti de competncia mais que comprovada, sabe tirar o mximo de sua orquestra. Andamentos corretos e pleno conhecimento da partitura s fazem aumentar a qualidade de suas interpretaes.
  Fator fundamental para o bom desenvolvimento da pera Nabucco  o coro. Participa intensamente de todos os atos e apresenta a parte mais conhecida da partitura, V Pensero! Escravizados, humilhados e esperanosos, assim representam os coristas do Scala. Cantam e atuam muito bem, com um estilo nico. Muitos deles com nvel de solista. Acompanhando o coro o baixo Paata Burchuladze interpreta o papel de Zacarias, lder dos judeus. Voz profunda, escura e com graves generosos. Empresta divindade ao seu personagem. Defende seu povo com unhas e dentes, maquiagem e figurino perfeitos.
  A imagem do dvd  de boa qualidade, nada excepcional por se tratar de uma matriz analgica. O som  de boa qualidade.  possvel escolher cenas, menu prtico e fcil de usar.
  O leitor deve estar se perguntando o por qu do ttulo? Duas verses , dois caminhos. O outro caminho  um tenebroso Nabucco filmado em Napoli. Difcil imaginar como um teatro de fama internacional consegue errar tanto em uma produo. Solistas fracos tem aos montes, Maurizio Fruzoni, Carlo Colombara e Lauren Flanigan esto com vozes inadequadas . As vezes ocres, as vezes opacas. O nico que se salva  Renato Bruson , mesmo assim no est em seus melhores dias. Canta sem muita inspirao, nada comparado ao Nabucco do Scala. A regncia de Paolo Carignani lembra uma banda do interior . Sem brilho e com uma leitura no mnimo equivocada, ou estranha da partitura .
  Os destaques ficam com os cenrios e figurinos, modernos , leves e bonitos. Os coristas so outro fator positivo, conseguem cantar bem, mesmo com as trapalhadas dos solistas. A direo de televiso erra em muitas tomadas, no mostra o essencial da histria. Som e imagem de pssima qualidade. Voc que gosta de Verdi, que aprecia pera, fuja dessa verso.
  O dvd de Napoli  a prova contundente que para fazer boa pera  preciso de solistas gabaritados. No adianta acertar na produo e pecar nos cantores, mesmo os papis ""menores"" devem merecer ateno especial. J vimos muitas peras com excelentes solistas e pssimos comprimrios. Os mritos ficam com  o Scala de Milo , acertou em todos os quesitos e fez um excelente trabalho. O San Carlo nesse Nabucco mostrou mais equvocos que acertos.

1981690,3,B00019GH8E,"If this recording were sound only on a CD, I wouldn't hesitate in giving it 5 stars or whatever is the maximum.  This would be in spite of the fact that the libretto is hilariously fictional.  It isn't even Biblical, which is another sort of fiction.

I strongly recommend you get the CD set if available, and avoid this visual dog of an opera.  The cast is nothing short of being in glorious voice.  Ricardo Muti's hand at the podium is firm, yet flexible, bringing out the strong sense of drama in this piece.  The wonder of the piece is Abigaila, a role which has ruined many a voice and which some great sopranos have refused to sing.  Ghena Dimitrova has the measure of this part and sings it with great bravura.  The other major parts, while not quite so challenging, are performed fully up to Dimitrova's standard.  Shut your eyes, or at least don't look at the screen more than necessary to get a sense of the subtitles, and you're in for a huge treat.

Well, now we have the opera itself.  Plot-wise, it's a mess.  Pre-20th Century opera often plays fast and loose with history, but Nabucco is in contention for being the worst piece in this category.  It's about as historical as Disney's ""Snow White"".  The title character is known in English as Nebuchadnezzar II or Nebchadrezzar - a distortion of his real name, Nabu-kudurri-usur.  In the opera, he is called ""King of Assyria"".  Yeah, sure.  But in his time, Assyria had already been disposed of; he is actually king of Bab-Ilu (Babylon).  In the opera he has 2 daughters (Abigaila and Faena), one adopted (presumably) and one by birth, one with a Hebrew name and the other with a name of unknown provenance.  The plot is driven by the ambition of the former and the purity and sweetness of the latter.  Neither of them is known to real history.

Nabucco and his subjects supposedly worship the god Baal as Head God (they actually worshipped Marduk).  Baal was Head God of the people of Canaan, Phoenicia, and other places in that general area.  The Tanakh (""Old Testament"") runs a tabloid-style story about Nebuchadnezzar going mad and eating grass and all that.  In the opera Nabucco goes sort of mad (mostly by having bad dreams).  This is followed in Bible and opera by a ludicrous conversion of ""Assyria"" to the worship of Yhwh (""Jehovah"").  The Book of Jonah contains a similar howler.  There is a scene in which the great statue of ""Baal"" crumbles to the ground, but for some reason (see below) it's omitted - greatly weakening the dramatic impact of the production.

So much for the shortcomings of Verdi's librettist.  We turn now to the physical production, which is where the real problems of this version of Nabucco reside.  To put it briefly, this is one of the worst examples of the ""stand still and sing"" perversion of opera I've ever seen.  Somehow opera has become the museum piece of the musical world, performed with the dead hand of reverence - and the hand on this performance is particularly dead.  In scene after scene, in war and in civil dissention, the chorus stands stock still.  At one point the chorus stands around in front of an elevated tableau that doesn't even twitch during the whole scene.  The main characters don't fare much better.  They stand just as still, but they do it in a spot light.  This is why the idol of Baal doesn't crash and crumble to the stage floor:  it would be embarrassing to get more movement out of a statue instead of the people.

Granted, there is some movement.  It occurs when it's absolutely unavoidable - people coming onstage or going offstage.  Nabucco does one aria lying on the ground - easier to hold still, you know.  Such movement as does exist is usually fairly languid.  On the whole, the vigor and movement of the music in Muti's hands is in telling contrast to the pallid, trance-like aspect of the people onstage.  Verdi would have had a coronary.

Speaking of stage aspect, we should consider costumes and sets.  Don't expect to see anything that even remotely resembles the Middle East of the 6th Century BCE - although some of the long tiered robes resemble costumes shown in Assyrian and Babylonian art.  The color scheme is generally almost monochromatic for the most part uninteresting - and not at all representative of a barbaric era of strong coloring.

The sets are monumental, not at all resembling the architecture of the period but at least like it in spirit.  The only thing that has a feel of Assyro-Babylonian times is a gigantic representation of the brilliant ""Dying Lioness"" frieze from (as I recall) Nineveh, the pinnacle of Assyrian art.  Not that the King of Babylon would have any such thing in his palace....  On the whole, the sets are more surrealistic than strictly representational.  In fact, they tend to overwhelm at the same time the static choruses underwhelm.  This disparity of scale adds to the ridiculous note already sounded by all the goings-on - or, rather, lack of goings-on - in the staging.

So the performance gets 5 stars, the staging gets 1 star -- average, 3.  I've already said it:  to get the part of this opera that's really good, get the CD set.",1224115200,11,5137,4.654060066740823
1981691,4,B00019GH8E,"SOURCE: Live performance from La Scala in Milan, produced by National Video Corporation in association with Radiotelevisone Italiana, Milan.  Nabucco was the first production of La Scala's 1986-87 season, so this performance can be assumed to have occurred in the autumn of 1986.

SOUND: Generally adequate two-channel stereo.  The microphones were apparently set to capture the solo vocalists and the orchestra.  The chorus is attended with less care, leading to what strikes me as a seriously underpowered ""Va, pensiero"" in Act III.

CAST: Nabucco (Nebuchadnezzar), King of Babylon - Renato Bruson (baritone); Abigaile, the elder but adopted daughter of Nabucco (or maybe his daughter by a concubine slave) - Ghena Dimitrova (soprano); Fenena, younger daughter of Nabucco - Raquel Pierotti (soprano/mezzo-soprano); Ismaele, presumably the son of Nerthaniah, son of Elishama, of the blood royal - Bruno Beccaria (tenor); Zaccaria, High Priest of Jerusalem - Paata Burchuladze (bass); High Priest of Baal at Babylon - Mario Luperi (baritone);  Anna, a Jewish woman - Francesca Garki (soprano); Abdallo, a loyal officer in Nabucco's Guard - Ernesto Gavazzi (tenor).

CONDUCTOR: Riccardo Muti with the Orchestra and Chorus of Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

SETS AND LIGHTING: Not very impressive and generally dim.  Act I takes place in the interior of what is meant to be Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.  The main feature (indeed, about the only feature) is a long, curving, gloomily lit staircase.  Act II takes place in the palace in Babylon, a bluish and largely featureless space, and a hall elsewhere in the palace, conceived as a curving, blue, set-spanning staircase.  Act III, Scene 1 is specifically identified in the score as the hanging gardens, but there is not a plant, hanging or otherwise in sight.  The set has touches of Baroque architecture and animal motifs.  It couldn't possibly look less Babylonian.  It is bluish, though.  Scene 2 is ""on the banks of the Euphrates.""  It consists of dimly lit, anonymous risers that allow for silhouettes against a featureless sky.  The gloom makes the chorus all but invisible.  Act IV returns to the palace, this time to a virtually blank stage.  Scene two (supposedly the hanging gardens again) is a large, white stairway leading to a golden, man-sized statue of Baal at upstage center.  This is the brightest scene in the opera.  It looks like a moonlit night.

COSTUMES: Poor Ismaele has the only touch of red to be seen in the whole production; unfortunately, he seems to be wearing a dress best suited for the Homecoming Queen of Babylon High School.  His pearl-covered hat is something that Theda Bara would have killed for.  Fenena, in her pale, high-collared dress, dead-white make-up and sugar loaf hat, looks like she has just beamed down from the moon.  Zaccaria is wearing a sort of caricature of a Pope's miter, encircled by a golden crown, beneath which appear the (Roman ) letters YHWH.  I imagine that a real high priest of Jerusalem would have thought that in terrible taste at best, and more likely blasphemous.  There are some white costumes, but most are dark blue or black and hard to see in the parsimonious lighting.

STAGE DIRECTION: Almost absent.  The singers were apparently told to stand here or there and then left to their own devices.  This is very much a classic operatic stand-and-deliver staging.

COMMENTARY: ""Nabucco"" was Verdi's third opera and his first hit.  It was a sensation that established him on the spot as the successor to Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti.  He had just come through a personal crisis in which his wife and children had died in rapid order and his second opera, a comedy of all things, had been such a failure that it had been withdrawn from production.  His depression was such that he had decided to give up composing.

One of the most famous stories in operatic lore speaks of Verdi's producer physically forcing a copy of the libretto of Nabucco into his pocket, of Verdi throwing it across his room, of the manuscript falling open to ""Va, pensiero,"" and of the way that caught his attention.  When Giuseppe Verdi died six decades later, thousands of Italians spontaneously sang ""Va, pensiero"" as his funeral procession passed by.

In 1842 many regarded Verdi as an unpolished peasant from the tiny town of Busetto.  He had no significant patrons in the musical world and only a few advocates.  One of them was the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi.  She had championed his first opera and she appeared in the first production of his third as Abigaile.  She would eventually become his second wife.  Prior to her long and devoted alliance with Verdi, she had led a life not at all unlike that of Violetta Valery in her husband's ""La Traviata.""

The libretto is a fine example of 19th Century Italian piety, blood and thunder action, and casual indifference to historic facts.  In this opera, for example, the king of Babylon is regularly called an Assyrian.  He, the very man who had carried the Jews into Babylonian exile, is portrayed as ordering their return to Jerusalem--just seventy years too early.

""Nabucco"" is early Verdi, but it is a true masterpiece.  It has never dropped out of the standard operatic repertory and it works as effectively today as it did in 1842.  ""Nabucco"" not only established Verdi as Rossini's, Bellini's and Donizetti's peer, it demonstrated that there was already more sheer, bold muscularity in his composition than in all three of his predecessors combined.

Bruson is good as Nabucco.  He is a natural baritone, though, and I personally prefer a bass-baritone sound for the part.  Burchuladze is a fine bass-baritone Zaccaria, although here again my preference would be for a true basso-profundo.  Dimitrova is excellent in the role of Abigaile, a notorious voice-killer.  At the time of this recording, she had no serious rivals in the part.  The Ismaele and Fenena are adequate in their parts, although far more memorable for their preposterous costumes than for their singing.

This production marked the return of Riccardo Muti as Music Director of La Scala.  He gives the audience their money's worth by conducting the overture like a hyper-active windmill on speed.  After that, he is calmer and turns in solid work.

This is a good performance, one that's noticeably better sung than staged.  Fortunately, the staging is merely inadequate rather than stupid and insulting in the manner of so many productions in this age of Eurotrash  ""Regietheatre.""

1981692,5,B00019GH8E,"This 1987 performance of a La Scala production of Verdi's Nabucco is stunning and powerfully rendered. A superior Nabucco you are hard-pressed to find. This production stars Renato Bruson as the titular Babylonian tyrant, Ghena Dimitrova as the wicked Abigaille, Becaria in the tenor role of Ismaele, Pierotti as Ferena and Burchuladze as the Zaccaria the Priest. La Scala opera productions are top-notch, and the singers, even if some of them are not well-known, are of the highest calibre. Of the entire cast, only baritone Renato Bruson and soprano Ghena Dimitrova stand out as well-known singers. Bruson's power lies in the combination of a dramatic and rich, full Verdi voice as well as his portrayal as Nebuchednezzar. His facial expressions are intense and stern, his costume befits the character well: a silvery armor with helmet. He is fierce, proud, haughty and vainglorious. In the scene after he is struck by God's lightning for assuming he had become God, he has a dramatically rendered Mad Scene. In the last Act, when he finally admits to being a mere mortal and repents, we SYMPATHIZE with him. After his aria, we are moved. I was. And in that final scene when he leads the ensemble in ""Immenso Jehovah"" after destroying a statue of Baal, the opera reaches a powerfully emotional climax. As the opera's hero, Renato Bruson pulls all the stops and sings the role with more dramatic integrity and more beautiful voice than any baritone I've heard.

Ghena Dimitrova's Abigaille is another attraction. Her voice is supremely powerful, and the fiendishly high tessitura of the role is a piece of cake for her. This was her signature role. She is an imperious, vindictive and completely evil Abigaille, the adopted daughter of Nabucco who was born a slave. Her rival, the other daughter of Nabucco, is sung by mezzo Pierotti with great bravura and touching pathos. I didn't care for the tenor Becaria in the role and would have preferred Placido Domingo in the role, for his richly layered voice would have made his minor character far more developed. One review mentioned how the women's costumes were hideous. I disagree. Ghena Dimitrova looks wonderful in the costumes. When she enters with her entourage of armed men, clad in a midnight blue armor, flowing cape and helmet, she looks almost like a Valkyrie in Wagner's Die Walkure. The mezzo singing Ferena looks like a fairy-tale princess, a vision of purity in a white veil and gauzy white gown, studded with tiny crystals. All the costumes are terrific and this is the most gorgeous-looking Nabucco I've ever seen. Babylon looks like a mythical, exotic land, at times resembling Atlantis, as in Act 3. When Abigaille becomes Queen, her Throne Room is grandiose and decorated with images of mermaids, fish, and the Zodiac sign. In the duet with Nabucco, the backdrop contains a tunnel where a light shines through and in the highest part we see cherubs and in the lower portions we see Assyrian animal and human figures. The contrast between the white robes of the Hebrew priests and veiled women in white and the dark or midnight blue armor of the pagan Assyrians is a great touch, evoking good versus evil. On DVD, it's a must have. I love all of Act 2 and 3. Ricardo Muti conducts with aplomb, really immersed in the music and making grandiose Karajan-like or Toscanini like gestures.",1132617600,19,3353,4.8927943760984185

1981695,5,B00019GH8E,"Nabucco, one of Verdi's  earlier operas that he completed in 1842, was the work that launched his career. The choral gem, 'Va pensiero', quickly became the unofficial national anthem for the Italians whose country was under duress from its neighbors at the time.

This performance stars Renato Bruson as Nabucco, Ghena Dimitrova as Abigaille, Paata Buchuladze as Zaccaria and Raquel Pierotti as Fenena; it is performed at the La Scala in Milan. The conductor is Riccardo Muti, whose animated performance during the overture was, to me, one of the highlights of this DVD. The video and editing was done expertly by Brian Large, whose deftness in this area (not only in this recording but others I've seen as well) seems to allow him to consistently get the best  vantage points and camera angles.

The scenery is elaborate in its structure, with some surreal qualities that at times, I found a little out of context. The costumes of the principals and corps de opera were generally resplendent in quiet flat tone robes and gowns befitting the circumstances and occasion. The exception here were the two female leads(Abigaille and Fenena) whose attire could best be described as unbecoming (honestly, bordering on ugly)

The performances are sincere and powerful; the voices well controlled and vibrant. This Nabucco adequately interprets the era it tries to represent with all its religious plotting and power struggles. The audience received this production with enthusiastic applause and cheers (as it truly deserved).

The disc allows you to go directly to any scene you like and the subtitles are available in five different languages including Italian. Bravo!

It is one of the most peaceful Verdi opera with one of the most peaceful endings (his daughter drinks poison, converts to Judaism and perishes in about five minutes) I have ever seen.  It was steeped in religion of course (this time Assyrian and Jewish), but (sigh) I'm getting used to it.  The singing and the music were wonderful.  A friend of mine who doesn't like opera commented that the sets and scenery were awesome.  It is early Verdi (his first hit in fact), and the tunes (except ""go my thoughts"") aren't as clearly defined as in, say, Rigoletto, and there is much choral singing.  But I liked it very much.

I am a fan of Sam Ramey in anything, so the Met wins in that area.  The costumes at the Met are a little over the top, and they are over the top here as well, just not quite as much.  I suppose in the end I would have to choose this one because the sound quality, although frankly not up to par, at least is UNIFORM.  The Met video has generally better sound, but overloaded and harsh in areas.  It is a tough call, as I say, they are both traditional stagings with great artists.

For such essential repertoire, one really needs both ... :)",1406073600,4,1043,5.023255813953488
8008485,3,B00019GH8E,I ordered this DVD because I had heard and loved the music. The voices were fine in this DVD but the staging was boring and the costumes were totally terrible. What ever was the costume designer thinking to put the leading lady in something that looked like stretchy armor over her ample girth!,1403913600,,294,4.566037735849057
8008486,2,B00019GH8E,"Let's call the whole thing off. Sorry. I'll try to put a positive spin on this without coming right out and saying it was positively boring. Verdi's music is beautiful, and the singing, especially that of Renato Bruson, was excellent. The sets were nice, the costumes were pretty, and young Riccardo Muti was flamboyant. So much for the good part. Unfortunately, the staging was the sort that for years has kept audiences away in droves, and has inspired so many cartoons, usually depicting the proverbial fat ladies wearing horned helmets and carrying shields and spears. Most of the action was, ""Chorus, stand stage right and don't move or do anything to betray the fact that you are alive. On cue, you will raise your right hand and hold it there for 117 measures, then switch hands. Just stand there and sing. Oh, and Principals, same thing, except stage left."" I had a ticket for tonight's performance of Nabucco at Minnesota Opera, but after watching this, I gave the ticket back to them.",1348876800,4,994,4.784883720930233
8008487,5,B00019GH8E,"Verdi, one of Italy's most well-known and highly respected composers, created some of the most evocative operas throughout the 19th Century. However, it was Nabucco that brought him to international fame. His first two operas failed to impress critics and audiences, but his third opera gained him some respect that he never earned with his first two works. Nabucco is a spectacle of biblical proportions. It tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and the exile of the Jews. Since this was composed when Verdi was still fairly young, colorful melodies are less frequent. However, the opera is still a masterpiece with its terrific vocal solos and catchy musical themes.

As with many other operas from Verdi, Nabucco is often performed in numerous opera houses every year. I have only seen one live performance so far: the 1987 La Scala presentation with maestro Riccardo Muti.

CONDUCTOR:
Muti's vision of Nabucco is a definitive marvel. It's quite authoritative: he favors quick tempi and high tension. His choice of pacing can be quite aggressive, but it's necessary for such a dramatic opera. Some of the most famous arias (including the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves) are taken at a moderately slow pace, so none of the natural beauty is lost.

ORCHESTRA:
The Orchestra of La Scala is, of course, fantastic. They play with stunning enthusiasm throughout the opera. The players are obviously some of the most skilled musicians at the time of this specific performance.

STAGING:
I never thought I would see such minimal stage action during such an exhilarating opera. Most of the time, the singers (soloists and choir) just stand there, frozen in place, even during the most intense moments. Only Nabucco and Abigaille move around the stage while expressing various emotions. Thankfully, the impressive sets make up for the deficient stage action. The costumes and sets are semi-traditional: they look properly biblical, yet most of them look very quasi-realistic, almost as if they've comes directly from expressionistic paintings.

PERFORMANCES:
This is such a wonderful ensemble of soloists, one of the most memorable for the stage. The great Renato Bruson performs brilliantly as the title character, while Zaccaria is sung by Paata Buchuladze with a clear and stellar voice. The late Ghena Dimitrova is a marvel as Abigaille. Raquel Pierotti and Bruno Beccaria are excellent as Fenena and Ismaele. The rest of the cast (Garki/ Gavazzi/ Luperi) does a fine job with their respective roles.

CONCLUSION:
This is one of the finest operas I have ever seen, and it'll probably become one of my favorites soon. Since this was the first time I have ever seen Nabucco, I have to say that, despite its lackluster stage direction, this production is absolutely outstanding. With first-rate conducting, a lovely orchestra, incredible choir, fine sets & costumes, and an unforgettable cast of soloists, this rendition of Nabucco is essential for both beginners and avid Verdians.
