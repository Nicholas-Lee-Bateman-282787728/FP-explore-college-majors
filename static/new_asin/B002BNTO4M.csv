3895152,3,B002BNTO4M,"From this movie's self-description, you might think this is a a benign documentary about the life and art of a Philadelphia muralist. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  This documentary is about a deeply disturbed man who was repeatedly sexually molested as a child and about all the ensuing horror in his life, his art, and in the lives of those around him. Yes, the man makes murals in Philaelphia but honestly this movie is not about that. If you want to see a movie about murals, look elsewhere; I wish I had.",1266278400,4,520,4.531914893617022
3895153,4,B002BNTO4M,"This little gem isn't so much a documentary as much as it is a story. It's rather typical in its portrayal of a family dealing with depression, adultery, and separation, but what draws it all together into one big mound of coolness is the creativity involved in Isaiah's (The Father) work as an artist, particularly focusing on mosaic design. I believe the movie said the family resided in Philadelphia, and Isaiah's entire focus is beautifying life in and around the city by putting himself and his loved ones into his work. That coupled with the slow deterioration of his immediate family make for an interesting, if somewhat involved, piece of film making. Typically, most documentaries bore me to yawns and tears, except for those based in the genre of science, but as much as I wanted to turn this off, I couldn't help but stay glued to it, for all the wonder and color of Isaiah's work, for all the strength and stability of his wife, Julia, for the innocence and caring demeanor of Zeke, the brother who isn't filming the movie, and for Jeremiah, the brother who is filming the movie, and his attention to detail in describing, not only with interviews, but with highly visual aspects, the nature of the world in which he grew up. This one gets four stars from me! ****  Highly enjoyable!",1263340800,8,1295,4.6798245614035086
3895154,5,B002BNTO4M,"This documentary is so very very good , I hope it gets nominated for an Academy Award , it is about  passion and a couple with a real deep HEARTISTIC connection to each other , never mind the artistic .  That their son made this movie was so very cool and that both sons stepped up to help the parents realign with each other goes so against what we are all taught  in our culture today. BRAVO, BRAVO .BRAVO!",1253059200,6,408,4.139240506329114

8361673,5,B002BNTO4M,"I loved this movie. It really made me think about the line between genius and insanity, the amount of love and passion that it takes to create something monumental. Though I don't love all of Isaiah Zagar's pieces, overall I'm in awe of his vision, his life, his single-minded pursuit of his dream. It's beautiful.

There is one scene in particular that may make some viewers uncomfortable, where Isaiah talks about an experience he had with an elder man as a child. If you're watching this with or as someone who has a history of abuse (Isaiah doesn't characterize the experience that way), it could potentially be upsetting. Just be aware.",1389571200,,641,4.774774774774775
8361674,5,B002BNTO4M,"Very interesting story about a mosaic sculptor in Philadelphia, PA-  Takes the viewers into the mind if an artist who began his career by making sculptures from the items that the tenants in his apartment buildings had left behind when they moved out-  If you want to learn how to make sculptures from broken bottles and broken sinks, toilets, etc. Isaiah Zagar is the expert !!!",1384992000,,379,4.7272727272727275

8361676,5,B002BNTO4M,Five stars for this film. The DVD is focused not only on the artist but his family. It is a documentary of his works and how his family and outside life come into his creation. Amazing!,1358035200,2,185,4.166666666666667
8361677,5,B002BNTO4M,"I love this documentary. I buy very few discs and I waited a long time to purchase this because of the expense, but finally I was concerned it might go out of print and disappear. It is a documentary filmed by a son, in an attempt to better understand, and perhaps even forge a closer relationship with his father. His father is an eccentric, perhaps mentally ill artist who works in mosaics, in the most extreme fashion, and has been emotionally, if not physically absent for much of family life. Is a beautiful, emotional and disturbing family journey, as well as a glimpse into the mind and art of a very unique man. Truly unique.",1343433600,5,633,4.51304347826087
8361678,4,B002BNTO4M,"Great movie about an interesting family. Makes me want to visit Philly to check out Isaiah's art. I enjoyed the beautiful animated sequences of photographs and illustrations, as well as moving shots through Isaiah's buildings.",1293235200,5,226,5.485714285714286
