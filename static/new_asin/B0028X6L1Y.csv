Eureka Seven Vol. 1 has 6 disc's episodes 1-26 and Vol. 2 has 6 disc's as well with episodes 27-50.",1271462400,,246,3.843137254901961
3874918,4,B0028X6L1Y,"I've got to say, you'll get your money's worth with this series. At 50 episodes AND an OVA, the show has some longevity and will take up some space in your collection. It is worth it.

Continuing from the first season, the action remains top notch. However, in early episodes of volume 2, you'll notice that the animation quality has gone down. This is corrected about episode 30 or so, so no big hit there.

Most of the character relationships, backgrounds, and the back-story are finally filled in for us. And there are some genuine tear-jerker moments to be had. The wife and I enjoyed the heck out of this show, but it isn't quite up there with a tightly wound, explosive series like ""Cowboy Bebop"".

Eureka 7's only downfall is it's generally lax pacing and repetitious soundtrack. Characters (specifically Eureka) have a tendency to fold in on themselves and not develop for LONG stretches of time, or at worst act uncharacteristically. The last few episodes may confuse you. But, there's nothing too terribly awful about this entire series, save for the English dub of Eureka's kids. Were they meant to be that annoying?

Taken for what it is, Eureka 7 carries some great libertarian, anti-state messages, runs on a free spirit, and generally does its own thing. The wife and I enjoyed marathoning this, but my suggestion now would be to take it slow and rewatch episodes as well.",1266451200,7,1387,4.766666666666667
3874919,5,B0028X6L1Y,eureka 7 is a grat show to biging to it a moust see for any anime fan and the end will blow you away so don't mis this one,1255046400,,122,3.2413793103448274

3874921,5,B0028X6L1Y,"If you have never seen Eureka 7 you need to see it, period.  If you are a fan of Evangelion, you need to see it, period. If you love crazy mecha action, you need to see it, period.

I'm not kidding.  This show has me thinking . . . . dare I even say it. . . that it is even better than my beloved Evangelion.  I never thought there would be anything that could ever come along that would make me even suffer a fleeting thought like that but with Eureka 7, my mind has been flooded with that realization. . . . Eureka 7 may be the greatest anime series of all-time.

Now it has to be said, there are a lot of similarities between Eva and Eureka 7, and you can tell that BONES was highly influenced when creating this story by the classic Angel series. How only the ""chosen"" can pilot the Nirvash (just like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd child in Eva) and there seems at least at the beginning to be another alien race that wants to destroy mankind (like the Angels in Eva) and that the subject of rebirth for mankind (the Third Impact).  But Eureka 7 seems to run with these themes and tie them all together with one of the most heart-wrenching love stories I have ever seen.  Pure brilliance.

And I have to say that I have watched the series both with the Eng subtitles and with the Eng dub and I have to say the English translation on the dub is great and perhaps delivers an even more moving performance from the voice actors.

I have never teared up more at an anime.  Weird.  What always got to me was during the English dub at the end of every episode Renton and Eureka would both say in unison ""To be continued. . ."" but in a way and tone that reflects how the episode ends emotionally.  At the end of many episodes they sounded happy, chipper, excited, relieved, worried. . . it really let you know how the characters were feeling.

But what really got to me was the end of episode 47 I think.  They had such a sound of hopelessness in their voices like everything was done. . . and then at the end of episode 49 . . . there was only Renton uttering those words.  I have never been more emotionally invested in the characters of an anime series in my life and it may be because they reel you in with 50 episodes!

Buy this show.",1247270400,23,2227,4.12037037037037

3874925,2,B0028X6L1Y,"Not a bad anime. Scifi mecha series. Renton is the young boy the series centers around who falls for the not quite human Eureka. Together the two pilot the mech, Nirvash. Personally, the supporting cast save the series from being too immature. The show clearly is intended for children. The main characters: Renton who loves Eureka who has 3 adopted kids all of them clearly under the age of 15. There are so many episodes where within a single episode all these children are overacting every emotion that they can. It is like watching Daddy's Daycare towards the end of the series and then you return to the scifi mecha universe that is Eureka 7. Aside from the whiny, weepy, angry, complaining rebel kids, the anime isn't half bad. I wouldn't recommend buying, but renting or watching online I would.
Overall, Renton has to have everything spelled out to him in every episode, even after the plot is revealed he still doesn't understand what's going on (by now even anyone old enough to even watch can't understand why he doesn't ). Renton has an emotional breakdown along with Eureka and her adopted kids in every other episode.  By the last episode Renton still doesn't understand what's going on, crying, ranting, throwing a tantrum but just like every episode within a minute he pulls it together just in time to be a man/hero.",1397088000,,1333,4.745689655172414

3874927,5,B0028X6L1Y,"If you're looking for another great mecha series that has comedy, drama, romance, mystery and a little bit of angst then this is the series for you.",1388534400,,148,4.518518518518518
3874928,4,B0028X6L1Y,"Maybe you've seen my review on the first collection--and if you have, it's the same exact thing for this one. Nothing is wrong with the show. In my mind, the show is nearly perfect. Sure, it takes and borrows from some of the other greats, but this is a story truly its own, truly unique. It has earned its place as one of the anime greats all on its own.

This is merely about the packaging and about the various minor and not-so-minor scratches that were to be found on every single disc. Some were deep and wide enough that I panicked, thinking that the disc wouldn't play. Luckily I was wrong and everything works, but it still slightly upsets me that such a rare and wonderful work from Bandai wasn't in as prestine a condition as I would have hoped upon arrival. This is my only qualm.

If you're even thinking about buying this--even if you aren't yet--BUY IT WHILE IT IS STILL CHEAP! You will not be disappointed. At least... That's what the teenage fan-girl drooling over this series on the inside of me tells me :P

Seriously, though, well worth the money and I couldn't be happier that I own one of the greates going-out-of-print anime of all time, getting it all less than $500 to boot! :)",1386892800,,1201,4.425339366515837
3874929,5,B0028X6L1Y,"And the DVDs help bring that experience to you. Enough juicy special features to sink your teeth into plus all of the second season waiting to be enjoyed. I however highly disagree with the price listing I've been seeing on here. I was able to, believe it or not, able to buy my copy of this series for under $50, as apposed to above $100. The people who are selling this DVD set for so high should really get a better job to make some cash as appose to jacking the price on an anime series everyone should be able to enjoy. A series that takes you on a journey that not many series are willing to go, and are able to pull of successfully. Even the ending is understandable. So to anyone looking to buy this DVD set, haggle these otaku neckbeards from this high and mighty stance of superiority on setting the price for these DVDs. The DVDs were released in 2009, and shouldn't be going for anything more than their original price unless they were at least 10 or 20 some odd years old!",1378339200,,985,4.2727272727272725

3874931,5,B0028X6L1Y,"This is a very good continuation to a great 1st season. Renton starts to be less of a wuss. He really need to man up to win over Eureka. I love everything about this anime. It has drama, action, comedy, and fan service, thanks to Talho. We finally get to find out what happened to Renton's Dad and Sis. It's all pretty amazing, and a little heart wrenching.

The animation, soundtrack and characters all make Eureka Seven a very appealing anime. It's not even close to being one of the best animes ever. Anything by Key Visual Arts just towers above every other anime out there, but Eureka Seven is great! Please don't miss it.",1350086400,,627,4.452173913043478

3874934,5,B0028X6L1Y,This completes one of the best series ever made. It explains everything you had questions for in set one. The animation is top notch a few eposoides in just like the first set. Buy both at the same time as you'll want to watch it all at once!,1322265600,,242,4.0625
3874935,5,B0028X6L1Y,"If you're looking at this you've already either purchased the ""Eureka seveN: Complete Collection Volume 1"" or you're about to so there's no point in describing the series as I'm sure you're well aware that this is the single best science fiction story ever, animated or otherwise.

Volume 2 concludes the series with the same perfection you experienced (or are soon to experience) in the first half of the series. By the time the series ends, ""Eureka seveN"", unlike so many other series, not only answers every question you may have had and delivers several ""Holy crap!"" surprises, it actually has a very good, very satisfying ending.

I'm a very nit-picky person when it comes to my entertainment, but other than breathing at high altitudes and at tremendous speeds without some kind of air mask and and never changing their clothes despite several scenes where the female cast go shopping, there is not one scene, not one word of dialogue, which I can complain about. ""Eureka seveN"" is not only a fantastic and original science fiction story, it is impeccably well told from start to finish. Like ""Cowboy Bebop"", it's the kind of showpiece you can lend to your anim hating friends to show them than anim has come a long way since ""Robotech"" and ""Captain Harlock"" that they watched on TV when they were little.

Nice menus, good quality video and audio, and the English voice acting is as good as the original Japanese cast (yes it is, purists -- accept it) and I'd go so far as to say it's better because having Renton (the main character) voiced by a boy instead of a woman sounds a lot more convincing. Subtitle options include the now standard (for the most part) of well translated full subtitles or translations for Japanese words that appear in scenes only. Also, the opening and ending songs include both English translations and romaji for those who enjoy singing along.

My only disappointment is that the audio wasn't remastered into surround sound, but otherwise this collection is proof that Bandai finally ""gets it"" and has stopped buying properties to just dump cheap English dubs on us.

The extra's are a bit dry and the limited number of trailers for other series is disappointing as is having the third openings and endings appearing textless only once each and not at all for the final opening and ending, but it's a far cry from Bandai's past standard of not giving us any extras at all.

All of the commentary (one episode per disc) is ""hosted"" by the Japanese voice actors for Renton and Eureka with one or two of the other cast members as ""guests"", and with few exceptions this is rather like listening to a bunch of friends getting together and talking as they rarely bother to comment on the show itself. The sole exception is when the director ""guests"" and gives insights into some of the symbolism, much to the surprise of the ditsy hosts who clearly thought that this was just another dumb animated series. You'll lose track of the number of times they say with shock and surprise ""...and this aired at 7am on Sunday morning!"" every time a serious scene comes on.

The cast interviews (again, one per disc) with the English and Japanese voice cast is hit or miss (mostly miss) but that's the case with most DVDs; however, I would have preferred interviews with the people responsible for the actual production of this series like the directors and writers as I'd love to hear more about the symbolism, etc., but again, it's better than the nothing Bandai usually gives us.

In conclusion, don't hesitate to buy this series, and specifically, this two volume set of the complete series of ""Eureka seveN"".",1300838400,,3633,4.746434231378764
3874936,5,B0028X6L1Y,"This set contains the last 24 episodes of Eureka Seven, comprising the second half of the series which is much different in style and subject matter from the first.

The first half of the series dealt with Renton trying to fit in with Gekkostate and his... er, ""courtship"" with Eureka. This half has Renton and Eureka united as a couple and determined to face their destiny: a half spiritual, half scientific quest to commune with the mysterious Scub Coral life forms. Along the way, the Gekkostate, joined by some new characters and maybe even a few characters who'll switch their allegiances to the side of the heroes (to get slightly spoilery), have to face down the villain and his forces, who were shrouded in mystery in the first half of the series but come to prominence here.

Eureka Seven is a truly great anime series, one that combines a coming-of-age romance story with a sci-fi/fantasy epic and uses the trappings of counterculture movements like surfing, skating, and rave culture to give the thing a really unique feel. If you enjoyed the first half of the series you'll likely be on the edge of your seat (really!) with this more intense second half.",1300492800,,1166,4.767326732673268
3874937,5,B0028X6L1Y,"I have watched a lot of anime titles with mecha and casts of characters where a boy and a girl fall in love but this by far is the best. Mecha battles are fast paced, frantic, and like watching a ballet of graceful dancers (armed with guns and blades) dance through the skies (blowing up other mechs and slicing them to pieces). The art is well drawn and detailed, no corners skipped, if there was any reused footage I never picked up on it. Now, I am a guy and even though the mecha battles thrill me, the relationship between Renton and Eureka still pulls at my heart. Watching these characters go through trails and good times, watching their relationship grow and how it effects everything around them and how important it is to the developement of the story just makes me smile warmly and appreciate the love of my life even more. Renton is a very admirable character for his devotion to Eureka, and Eureka as well for the her devotion to others and Renton. A very positive Anime series.

The DVD collection is 50 episodes and I had no problems with watching them as the video is very clear and crisp and the english dubbing very well done. The discs feature drawings of the characters of the show and are well done so they don't look like cheap grey painted copies. Make sure to get volume one and two so you can see the series in its entirety. I haven't checked out all the special features, but there is art form the show and commentaries so the makers of DVD's put some effort into making this a very good DVD set. I hope this helps, and I am sure people will enjoy this series.",1288569600,5,1587,4.361486486486487

There are a lot of comedic points as well as serious. For me, I felt like all my questions were wrapped up at the end of the story and as a bonus, Eureka Seven actually has an enjoyable ending.
