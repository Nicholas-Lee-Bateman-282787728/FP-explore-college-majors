In a potboiler drama loosely based on Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino,"" San Diego's wealthy Larra&ntilde;eta family is a study in dysfunctionality. Patriarch Jorge (Rabal) rules with an iron fist. Oldest daughter Margaret (Channing) lives in her father's house with husband Ed (Coffin), much to the old man's disapproval and their misery. Beloved Jorge Jr. is dead, memorialized by a photo and ever-burning candle. Estranged first son Martin (Hurt) was ostracized for trying to sell dad's ranch when temporarily put in charge of it. Family baby but wise beyond her years, Irene (Follows) is saddened by so many things that are beyond her control.

Favorite child, middle daughter Josie (Leo) elopes with Army enlistee Jack (Hutton), a man of small prospect. An angry Jorge comes to their wedding night hotel and with a threat of disownment forces Josie to return home with him. Jack follows; both cars race down a dark road in a driving rain. Jack slows down but Jorge continue to speed. His vehicle goes off a wooden bridge and sinks in a bog. After jumping in after them, Jack is only able to rescue his bride.

Martin arrives at the hospital and is told of the events that led to his father's drowning. He gets a good look at his new brother-in-law and swears revenge against him. Jack's unit is sent to Italy; Martin begs his commanding officer for a transfer there and he ends up a corporal in Jack's platoon. We see his demented slow burn and wonder when Martin will attempt to fulfill that vow of vengeance.

A perhaps unconscious nod to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergei-Eisenstein/dp/6305908753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s rapid-cut editing technique occurs during one jarringly effective war sequence that consists of three separate scenes spliced together in split-second bites. Other WWII Italian Campaign scenes are expertly mounted and the family drama well-acted. Weakest link is William Hurt's failed attempt to portray the psychopathic black sheep, a hard-to-believe villain that spoils an otherwise superior picture. At times his imagined nemesis, Timothy Hutton also isn't convincing, with feeble grins meant to indicate fealty toward a man he doesn't know is planning to kill him.

7809533,5,6301115619,"Appropriate attention to detail is characteristic of this powerful, well-cast, and well-made melodrama with the action pivoting about a San Diego based Spanish Basque family, skillfully directed by Basque Mexican Gregory Nava and featuring effectual contributions from many members of the cast and crew.  Two of cinema's ablest and most intense actors, William Hurt (who partially researched his role at the Center For Basque Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno) and Timothy Hutton, perform here as brothers-in-law obliged by one's iniquity to resolve their fateful conflict with violence, while other singular performances come from Melissa Leo, Stockard Channing, and Megan Follows as siblings of the Larraneta family, and Francisco Rabal is impressive as paterfamilias of the clan.  A potent scenario emphasizes love and revenge as primary emotions within a creatively edited work noteworthy for its brilliant cinematography and montage by Nava as well as director of photography James Glennon, the action shot principally in Croatia, Trieste, and southern California.  Suspense, an essential element of any genre, permeates the film, extending from its opening scenes to a Hitchcockian flavoured climax, enhanced throughout by Hurt's dynamic reading and by finely wrought episodic Ennio Morricone scoring.  Costumes of Durinda Wood, set designs by Anne Kuljian, and the first-rate production designing of Henry Bumstead (who also plays several pages as an army Colonel) are united in the accurate recreation of 1942/5 San Diego as well as war battered Italy, and pre-war autos employed are correct.  The mentioned adherence to accuracy of detail is clearly evident during scenes filmed at the historic Santa Fe Depot in San Diego that is still in use, occasioning tactical concerns that are nicely handled.  Also of interest to cinephiles are wigs topping many of the females, due to contemporary (1988) modes of shorter hair, and additionally avoidance of obvious non-period jewelry among both featured players and extras.  The presence on the soundtrack of that ultimate Verdian soprano, Rosa Ponselle, reflects the posture of the film's creators toward constructing a vivid drama of grandly emotional proportions, an objective clearly attained with this woefully undervalued motion picture.",1108339200,4,2303,5.619596541786744
