8708270,4,B00UTTEN6O,"Black Bart DVD-R  (Distributed by ATI) I took a chance on this and did NOT get burned

No telling who is issuing these DVDs.  Google:  ""Audio Tape Inc"" and you will get no info, but at a bargain-bin price this is an acceptable product.

The cover art creates the dubious first impression of a rip-off:  Low-Res image with photoshopped elements of the original movie poster flipped and rearranged. Front cover erroneously credits Charles Bolles as a cast member (Bolles, AKA Black Bart, is actually Dan Duryeas character).  Likewise, the DVD label-art is of the DIY stick-on variety.  Back cover gets the 1948  production date, synopsis and cast correct. Undoubtedly cut and pasted from some other public domain"" source.  Case is the sturdy type.

The claim, on screen, pre-feature:  Mastered from the best sources.  The reality:  It looks like a clean-professional transfer from a high quality source film to digital with NO digital remastering or restoration work.  Best of all it has no obvious piracy telltales like a TCM broadcast logo popping up in the corner.

The print:  Of 114 Universal-International  Westerns, 101 were shot in Technicolor and this is one of them!  The print has a few artifacts (an obvious missing-frames-jump about 4 minutes-in and fuzzy resolution in a couple of spots a little later on) but is remarkably free of anything really annoying like scratches.  Miss De Carlos many close-ups are luminous.  Sound quality is excellent throughout.  In general, the same issues as found in the over-priced WB Archive Collection DVD-Rs.  The official Run-time is 80:30 my player reads it at 76:58 but I detected no splice or jump in continuity to suggest over three minutes of narrative is missing.  Not a ""Universal Vault Series quality item but the next best thing.

Fun fact: Yvonne De Carlo plays a very similar character (Lotta Crabtree) in Bonanza (S1 E1) A Rose for Lotta (1959).

It seems preposterous for ATI to slap on a copyright date (2005) and an FBI WARNING scroll whilst claiming the Public Domain right to distribute this intellectual property as if it was their own.  In reality this is  Cultural Heritage that belongs to us all.  These opportunists, like all such public domain raiders, have one goal: printing money for themselves without producing (or preserving) anything.

The Dream:  A Digitally Remastered Box-set of Yvonne De Carlos U-I Westerns / Adventures presented in 1080p by a reputable film-preservationists type studio.  The Reality:  Shot-in-the-dark public-domain stuff like this.",1515974400,,2535,5.119804400977995

8708276,5,B00UTTEN6O,"The good little Western, produced ostensibly to highlight the talents of Yvonne De Carlo, turns out to be just as much an excellent vehicle for that woefully underrated actor, Dan Duryea. Duryea spent most of his career playing second fiddle to more touted actors; often times he was a wonderfully fascinating ""bad guy."" He had a laugh and a sneer that were remarkable. Sometimes he was the proverbial ""good"" bad guy, as he is in BLACK BART. Here he tries to ""go good,"" but with interesting results. As always, he is extremely entertaining. Duryea's finest roles are, perhaps, as Whitey Kincade in the Audie Murphy film, RIDE CLEAR OF DIABLO. Then there is his portrayal of the psychotic military man in THE MARAUDERS. In BLACK BART Duryea's talent is on display again. This is a solid little Western. I have the import PAL DVD, plus a copy I made off TV; hopefully, it will appear on DVD  also in the American NTSC format. In any case, highly recommended.",1337385600,10,956,4.690476190476191
