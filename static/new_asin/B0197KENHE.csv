7565103,5,B0197KENHE,"A great follow up to Somm's this film is a great and very approachable insight into the wine industry, the growers, the history of the producers and more.

7565115,5,B0197KENHE,"An amazing documentary about the wonderful and mysterious world of wine. Its makers leave most conclusions to the viewer who has to decide whether or not wine tasting is a science, an art, or mostly nonsense?",1485216000,,208,4.805555555555555

As a budding oenophile I can say I learned a lot from this film and have watched it 4 times this week. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good bottle of wine. Because of this film I've begun trying and collecting as many types of wine as I can find and have become particularly interested in Barolo.,1468540800,2,463,4.213483146067416

7565160,4,B0197KENHE,"I enjoyed this video but I suspect it is because I watched the first video more than once and i knew the people.  That being said, I chose to give only four stars because I didn't feel as though some of the self-imposed questions were not actually answered - you have to infer the answer. I felt as though any negative position was skirted in order to keep from offending anyone (or everyone) in this community.  I do highly recommend the video because it is still fun to watch - just don't expect the same amount of depth as the first video.",1467763200,,542,4.303921568627451

7565235,4,B0197KENHE,"It's a very well done doc, praise to all technical depts.  HOWEVER, as others have noted, there is definitely an annoying sound issue when streaming the film.  After just a few minutes a loud thrumming takes over the right channel and continues throughout the film.  Like a helicopter hovering a few blocks away.  I decided to tough it out but I can see how most others would bail right away.",1456099200,3,392,4.557142857142857

7565252,5,B0197KENHE,"Great film/documentary. I learned a lot about wine. At the end of the day, red wine tastes the same to me whether its a $200 a bottle or $10 a bottle. No matter if I stand there and twirl my cup for 30 minutes or sip on it like its blazing hot. Listen, If you live in North america, California and Washington State have the best wines. If you live in Europe, obviously France and Italy have great wines. No different from religion its a matter of opinion. Just don't sit there and twirl your wine glass and smell it. You look ridiculous.",1455235200,,537,4.223300970873787
7565253,5,B0197KENHE,Great film whether you like wine or not.  Great human interest and especially great if you do happen to enjoy wine.
