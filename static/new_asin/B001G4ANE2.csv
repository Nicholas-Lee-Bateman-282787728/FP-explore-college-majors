8303807,5,B001G4ANE2,"This may be a bit long for a review, but it is absolutely worth it!
I found the weighted bar section of this DVD on my cable's 'On Demand' programming. I did the 20 minute session once a day with my broomstick. I shockingly lost 22 lbs in under a month (and still going) so I was understandably devastated when they removed it from the On Demand. Luckily, I was able to order the full DVD from Amazon!
I love Ms. Spreen's presentation, her commentary and the added tips about technique as well as her calm encouragement. I'm not a 'workout person', so her approach of fitness through combat routines drew me right in. The moves are fun, educational, easy to follow and far beyond any of the other workouts I have tried before. I actually look forward to doing the routine daily, which is a HUGE deal for me. This wasn't just about weight loss for me, I have a medical condition that has effected my life in many, many ways. Ms. Spreen's DVD has helped me immensely by giving me the tools to take back my self esteem, build my strength, improve my quality of life and has even greatly enhanced my coordination (which none of my medical treatments had been able to accomplish). I can not emphasize how incredibly life changing this has been for me. As I said before, I have only ever done the 20 minute bar section but I will definitely be checking out more of the routines!
Buy it, pick your favorite section of the DVD, do that part once a day and I assure you it will be worth it. I journaled every day as a way to hold myself responsible and to write down any moves that I felt I could improve on, as well as any parts I made progress on and was proud of. Every day I felt a little stronger, went a little further and gained a little more pride. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, effective workout that doesn't feel like a workout!",1478217600,2,1851,4.291428571428572
8303808,5,B001G4ANE2,Kimberly Spreen is excellent!  She gives great cues and gives you an excellent workout!! Worth every penny!!,1471737600,,108,5.352941176470588
8303809,5,B001G4ANE2,"This video is exactly like the workouts on SportSkool, which is where I found out about it.  I love following these different routines and always feel invigorated after each one.  Really great and one of the best, if not the best, kickboxing videos I have invested in.",1391817600,,268,4.680851063829787
8303810,5,B001G4ANE2,Amazon...Thank you sooo much for having this available...I'm still new at purchasing stuff on-line. But Amazon never ceases to amaze me...You always have what I'm looking for. This video was 'on-demand' with my cable tv. But one day I went to use it and it was gone...I was soo bummed. Then I just started looking and as always...my search always leads me back to you. It's great...Kimberly Spreen is great...And I am a very happy and healty customer. Thanks again.,1360972800,,465,4.825
8303811,4,B001G4ANE2,"I had actually taped a portion of this workout 2 years ago from cable t.v. I taped it on a vhs and realized that if I didn't find a dvd, eventually the tape would wear out! It's a good workout...burns calories. But I also just love the instructor (not too cutesy & annoyingly peppy!) and the kick-box workout gives a sense of strength, power & confidence. I love that she has moves that work your abs (core) while doing the standing workout...something besides crunches. I don't really do the part with the bar. I'm thinking I should buy another copy just in case something happens to this one! I either take it on vacation, or some of the moves & routines I can do from memory...basically, a good workout that you don't need any weights or equipment for.",1356825600,,755,4.478260869565218
8303812,5,B001G4ANE2,"This dvd is the same as Creative Instructor Video 2705 - just at a lower price. In it, Kimberly Spreen's cuing is clear and precise.  The premixes really add a lot of variety so you don't feel like you're doing the same old workout each time you use this dvd.  You don't need any equipment for the Kickboxing but a light body bar (maybe even a dowel) is used in the combat section.  The stretch at the end of the video is very thorough at about 8 - 10 minutes long.",1280620800,,465,4.087912087912088
8303813,4,B001G4ANE2,"Today was the first time I used this workout. before the workout, I weighted 126.5...after the workout...I weighed 124.6.  This is a really, really great workout.  I am a home excercisor and this has become my favorite workout in one fell swoop.  Cueing is so important and Kimberly does this so well. (I still need to practice the workout a few more times before I get it down.)Also, she explains the importance of proper form over exhertion throughout the workouts. The combat workout was so much fun.  Really different from exhausting workouts like Jillian Michaels, BFBM. This wokout left me feeling great after (I did the 94 min mix).  It was fun and interesting. I used a dowl from a broom  with with combat sections.  Sooooooo much fun!!!!!! I love trying different excersice videos and this one is truely a keeper. Kimberly created a great routine with this one...Way to go. This one makes my top 5 faves!!! Highly recommended.",1268265600,,935,4.80625
8303814,5,B001G4ANE2,"This is the same as CIA 2705, just repackaged at a much lower price - works for me!
This is a 92-minute workout but can be broken up into 1. kickboxing, 2. body bar workout, and 3. abdominals. It also has some premix options letting you alternate kickboxing with the body bar, or have a shorter workout with warmup and cooldown. It is medium to low impact throughout, but intense enough to make you sweat a lot. I did the body bar section with a 9 lb. bar which was just right for me (she recommends to not go higher than 9 lbs). The routine is varied, but so well cued that you can always keep up and it's never confusing. Kimberly is extremely likeable in this DVD and the encouragement feels real. I love when she says: Here we go again, I can't stop (and I just know what she means :-). I felt really good after this workout.",1239580800,13,829,4.1875
