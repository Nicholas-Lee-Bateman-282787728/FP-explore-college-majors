8439913,5,B004SKMHPY,"This is a true art. It happened to me that I had to watch this movie just with a flyer saying ""In a small town, something happens. blar blar"". It was a subtitled movie but it never bothered watching. Actually, I think, it did not to be subtitled. Watching the movie, I need not to even read subtitles. The screen said itself. Only watching the picture was enough to understand what was going on and feel all the emotions. They say music is the art without boundaries of language. I say this movie transcended languages. Movie is very Ole Bornedal. I pick Dina and this the favourite ones from director Ole Bornedal.",1362096000,2,615,4.5
8439914,4,B004SKMHPY,"Judge Josh Rode, DVD Verdict-- Deliver Us From Evil is not a slasher flick, but make no mistake: it is raw and often brutal. It makes no bones about showing abuse, beatings, murder, and rape, and all of it in gritty (though not gratuitous) detail. Idealistic Pernille (Norwegian pop star Lene Nystrm) tells her children early on, ""There are no evil people. Only people in need of love."" The rest of the film seems hell-bent on proving her wrong.

Deliver Us From Evil is set in a poor Danish town in the middle of nowhere and the feeling of small town hopelessness is so prevalent it almost becomes a character itself. Even the colors are faded, as if washed out by the weariness of existence. It's a strong effect, although it hinders some of the imagery possibilities; when Pernille stares with foreboding at spilled red wine, for instance, the muted color doesn't carry the same impact that a brighter tone would have.

Other than that, the picture is reasonably clean and sharp. The sound mixing is also nicely done, and I love the minimalist soundtrack. When there is music, it does a good job of fitting the scene and ramping up the emotion; only once does it spill over the top and become intrusive. Even better, Bornedal lets a lot of the film speak for itself without music, to great effect. The rape scene has only birdsong as its score, and is all the more unsettling for it.

The extras include a ""making of"" featurette, which talks mostly about small-town Denmark and how difficult it was for Bornedal to live there. There are also interviews with the main actors as they break down their characters. Then there is a trailer and ""The Theme,"" which is just Bornedal talking about how everyone has evil somewhere inside them.

8439915,4,B004SKMHPY,Not a bad movie.  I like Danish films...not quite as good as some others I've seen like Adam's Apples.  The story seemed to get better as the movie went along and had a pretty good ending.  Lene Nystrom is one lovely lady.  Never heard about her until I watched this film.,1309651200,,272,4.2745098039215685
