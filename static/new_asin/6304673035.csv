905911,4,6304673035,"There really are two reasons to see Elvis movies...the stunning time  capsulization of a gentler time and a different locale(It happened at The  World's Fair comes to mind!!!!love that Tomorrowland architecture) and the  music(Viva Las Vegas). This piece gives you both, a sort of sixties resort  acapulco, and some sizzling Esquivel tinged Latin Pop.  The title song, in  it's kind of non pc sort of way, is one of my favorites of the title track  variety(though thanks to a collection bought at a truck stop in New Mexico,  I have a great affection for many of them).  ""This is no time for  Siesta, this is time for fun"" demands Elvis, and truly the music is  fun.  No room to rhumba in a sports car is great for the title alone..  oh, Elvis is a cliff diver in this one, and as he is conquering his circus  performer demons he sings one of the great Elvis songs, which is one of a  small subgenre of his numbers.  The subgenre has to do with a guy trying to  get to some ethnic girl, but the only way she can communicate is through  the cultural dance of her heritage....Elvis's earlier foray into this  subgenre was The Blue Hawaii steel string tinged Rock-a-Hula Baby(penned by  Ed Wood girlfriend Dolores Fuller).  This one is the same song plot called  BosaNova Baby, and it is worth the entire video.  Elvis in bolero jacket,  banging away on drums and keyboard.  Never mind the diving(Do you  think he succeeds), get down with The King",968112000,5,1444,4.54296875

906005,3,6304673035,"Released in 1963, Fun in Acapulco stars Elvis Presley as a lifeguard/singer at a ritzy Mexican resort who stirs the interest of two women and rivalry of a Mexican diver. As with most of Elvis movies, he sings a song every 7-12 minutes.

While the story takes place in Acapulco and a lot of scenes were shot at a resort there, Elvis never set foot in Mexico during filming, presumably due to his busy schedule. This becomes clear as you watch the movie: Several cast members clearly shot some scenes at the actual resort (Ursula Andress, Elsa C&aacute;rdenas and Alejandro Rey), but whenever interaction with Elvis is required, out comes the rear-projection. Some good examples include Presleys bike ride with the Mexican kid, Elvis & Ursula along the street and every shot with Elvis and another character sitting or standing near a wall overlooking the ocean. The film is such a lark and rear-projection was so prevalent back then that the movie works in spite of this, but it was definitely noticeable and therefore excessive.

As far as the women go, forget Marguerita (Andress) and Delores (C&aacute;rdenas) (as fine as they are), I'll take Janie (Teri Hope), the petite blond on the boat at the beginning. She had the requisite curves.

The film runs 97 minutes.

Directed by Richard Thorpe.
Elvis Presley's 13th film. He was the age of 28 during filming.

Mike Edwards (Elvis Presley) is working on a boat, Lady M, coming into Acapulco. Also on another small motor boat are The Four Amigos: Armando, Pedro, Pablo and Sam. Armando tells him of a place to go to. Mike agrees. Now the daughter (Teri Hope) of the owner of the boat tries to make a move on Mike, but he resists her flirting because she is too young and immature.  Mike goes into town where he meets an 8-year old boy, Raoul (Larry Domasin), who tries to sell him some jewelry (very similar to the role he played in Dime With A Halo (1963)). Mike finds the El Torito's Restaurant and meets again The Four Amigos. Mike sings with them. That young girl is there too, but lies to her father about Mike and he gets fired. Now Mike doesn't have money to get back home to America. He needs to find work. The boy, Raoul, tries to be of help to Mike in getting work and he does.

906266,5,6304673035,"The Elvis Presley movie series are all fun, and entertaining. Of course their contrived storylines allow for the intermittent song. I guess technically the movies are musicals. Even though (they say) Elvis felt trapped in this multi-movie contract deal, there were some good movies to withstand time. I also like ""Kid Galahad"", ""Roustabout"", and ""Blue Hawaii"". I think everyone has their favorites. It's not heavy drama, it's just fun.",1404518400,2,435,5.318840579710145

906362,5,6304673035,"As a student of Spanish, ""Fun In Acapulco"" sounded curious, so i watched it and found it to be a great movie for anyone, young or old.  The scenery is beautiful of Acapulco, the ocean, the palm trees, the cliffs, everything.  Elvis gets a job as a lifeguard at an Acapulco resort while he is performing musical presentations on the side in nightclubs and hotels.  One of the best parts of the movie is the little Mexican boy, about eight-years old, who follows Elvis everywhere, giving him advice on how to succeed as a singer in Mexico.

Elvis sings some of his biggest hits, like Cassanova, and at the end, a Mexican traditional song about Guadalajara, after diving victoriously off the cliffs.  The only part that I found objectionable was the treatment of motherhood.  When Dolores takes Elvis out for a ride on a clear, Acapulco night and they discuss marriage, Dolores tells Elvis she doesn't want to get married since it is associated with cooking, cleaning and geting fat, and wiping the nose of a child.  But this is only a small part of the movie and it quickly moves on.

I've already watched it 3-4 times.  Highly recommended.",1395014400,,1138,4.65

And of course a young, trim Elvis.. This one is set in Acapulco, Mexico, and opens with Elvis being befriended by a young boy named Raul who wants to be his manager. After a rollicking duet while Elvis bicycles through the streets to where Raul tells him to go he gets hired by a hotel to sing because their regular singer is sick. Among various singing engagements Elvis encounters a sultry, female bullfighter, and the daughter of a chef who has a mission in mind. I also got treated to the lifeguard being played by Alejandro Rey, a good-looking guy I remember from The Flying Nun. Elvis' character, Mike, has a secret we see in flashbacks but that he keeps hidden. However, Rey finds out and calls him a coward. A fight breaks out leaving Rey too injured to do his famous dive off the cliffs so Mike takes up the challenge. As with all Elvis movies, everything turns out fine, including the end song, Guadalajara.",1373587200,4,1105,4.448275862068965

Still, this 1963 musical-comedy remains preferable to ""Blue Hawaii"" and ""G.I. Blues."" Bolstered by the presence of Ursula Andress and a solid supporting cast, the King rips into a few classic numbers such as the Leiber-Stoller hit ""Bossa Nova Baby."" However, the less said about ""No Room to Rhumba in a Sports Car,"" the better. Acapulco's Technicolor visions cannot disguise the fact that Elvis never set foot in Mexico (his scenes were shot on the Paramount backlot), which makes for a surreal viewing experience.",1280620800,,654,5.121495327102804

906787,5,6304673035,"KEN'S Review on Elvis movie Fun In Acapulco. Elvis has his hands full as a would-be cliff diver and former aerialist attempting to simultaneously cure his acrophobia and win the hand of an aloof displaced royal (Ursula Andress). Add to the mix a pint-sized impresario hoping to break our hero as a lounge act, the inevitable swarthy romantic rival, and a sultry lady bullfighter, and you'll see why ""You Can't Say No To Acapulco.""
Me and my wife Kathys have all 31 of Elvis Presley movies and this is one of oyr Favorites. Great Music, Dacing and Songs. I would recommened this movie to all Elvis Presley FANS!",1259280000,,610,4.657407407407407

906895,5,6304673035,"I've always liked this film.  Since my family didn't have money to travel, Elvis' 'travelogues' as he contemptously referred to them, were a welcome change of scenery when I was in my early teens and these films were first shown on network TV. Elvis was cool, he was in some of the most beautiful locales in the world, surrounded by beautiful women but otherwise he had a hospitality kind of job.  Any guy could imagine being Elvis and having his looks and talent. In a perfect world, Elvis would have had a multi-faceted career that reflected his talent. He would have scored in dramatic roles, recorded great interpretations of R&B standards as well as superior romantic ballads in addition to doing these 'travelogues.'  As a savvy business man, he could have made canny investments in resort hotels and travel services which this type of film would have promoted. Sort of like Jimmy Buffett does today.",1191283200,,906,4.832258064516129
906896,5,6304673035,This is a great Elvis movie. The singing is awesome and the cliff diving brings an edge to the movie. not your typical fall in love with the girl and sing to her all the time.,1185667200,,175,3.888888888888889
906897,2,6304673035,"I recently watched this movie with my young niece and nephew.  They like Elvis but most of his movies are pretty hard to take.  To keep them occupied, I told them that Elvis never left Hollywood to make this movie so they needed to spot the real Elvis shots and the other location shots that featured a double.  It worked.  Between songs, they had fun picking out the real locations from the bad rear-projection shots of Elvis.

""Bossa Nova Baby"" is the only real song worth anything (like ""Return to Sender"" was the only real song in GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!).  The rest all sound like bad Mexican tunes about bulls or bullfighters.  Ursula Andress is hot but she's a long way away from Honey Rider in DR. NO.

The best of Elvis's post-Army movies was VIVA LAS VEGAS and the worst--and there are a lot of them--would be HARUM SCARUM.  FUN IN ACAPULCO would fall directly in the middle.",1175990400,,882,4.49685534591195

906899,1,6304673035,"I've come to the conclusion that Elvis fans are simpletons. Here's another in a long, line of Presley vehicles that combines a juvenile plot, silly acting, and endless three chord songs with inane lyrics. This guy's acting was worse than his singing---and that's saying something. The most conspicuous thing about the movie is the amount of grease is Presley's hair and the repetitiveness of his monosyllabic dialogue. He was a real cornball with a gnat's IQ and no talent. Truly, do his idol-worshipping fans realize that Presley's IQ was under 80? If it wasn't for Colonel Parker, Presley would have spent the rest of his days driving trucks and eating fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Uh huh, uh huh.",1166140800,,713,4.95

906902,5,6304673035,"""Fun In Acapulco"" might look like it on-screen, but it wasn't fun in Acapulco for Elvis or Ursula Andress. Both of them were learning new languages. Ursula Andress was just learning English (reason for her voiced being dubbed in ""Dr. No""), and Elvis had to learn Spanish because some of the songs he sang have Spanish lyrics. So it was hard work for them. You have to hear Elvis sing in Spanish. It's so different. Here, he plays a former circus performer who comes to Acapulco to get away from his past. He's hired as a lifeguard at a hotel, and sings for the guests at night. Being a lifeguard wasn't easy, because when he was in the circus, he was in the acrobats. On one swing he missed his partner who fell to the ground and resulted in a terrible accident. When a rival lifeguard learns about it, he challenges him to dive again since now Elvis' character is afraid of heights. He's finally able to gain back his courage, beats up the rival Alejandro Rey in a great fight scene, and climbs to the highest clif and makes the highest dive. He wins the heart of Ursula Andress, too. Great latin rhythm, latin love, and latin themed Elvis flick.",1036800000,14,1147,4.440758293838862
906903,5,6304673035,"This movie review is not written by me. This movie review is written by Elvis Presley. April Fools Day! Elvis Presley heads south of the border. And if you don't know what I mean by that. He heads down to Mexico.
Mike Windgren (Elvis Presley) was put off a circus act with his famkly until an accident happens. The act is broken up. Now Mike is Mexico, where he is fired as a boat hand.
He is fired when his boss's minor daughter accuses him of bring her to a place that his not where she suppose to be. That same night he meets Raoul Almeido (Larry Domasin). He is a child. He looks like a midget Elvis!
Raoul helps Mike find a job at a htel. He is take the place of a bad singer, when the person is sick. And his aslo a part-time lifeguard at the pool. Before he's hired he meets cliff driver and the only lifeguard Moreno (Alejandro Rey). He dives 136 feet off a cliff. You won't catch me doing that.
He aslo meets Moreno's girl named Margarita Dauphine. She is played by Ursula Address. The songs are all sung by Elvis Presely with Larry Domasin sing a song with him. The movie was directed by Richard Thrope (Jailhouse Rock). Viva Elvis! Viva Mexico!",986083200,2,1155,4.254545454545455
906904,4,6304673035,"Fun in Acapulco is one of Elvis' top 5 movies. When he made it in 1963, he still had zip in his step and conviction in his voice. Those aspects faded after he completed Viva Las Vegas.
The scenery and songs are good with the South-of-the-Border flavoring, the script is one of the best ones in any Elvis movie, and when he breaks out into a song, it is on stage or in a more appropriate situation-not just starting to sing in the middle of a fight or something.
Fun in Acapulco showcased some of Elvis' acting ability as his character overcame his fears. Given a chance, Elvis could act, but his fans preferred to see him sing and dance. You get plenty of both in this movie.",983232000,2,675,4.28125
