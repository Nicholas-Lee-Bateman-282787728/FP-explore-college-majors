8167491,5,B000MAEXZ6,"I recently saw this on You-Tube before it was pulled for copyright infringement. I know a little about the subject and the fact Buchanan came out with this in 1984 shows he was ahead of his time since the Hendrix murder theory wasn't widely known at the time. Most likely Buchanan's source was from Hollywood insiders asssociated with Jimi's management and Warner Brothers. This would actually give it credibility, since they were the people who knew at that time.

  The average reviewer slams the movie as conspiracy theory nonsense without realizing the COINTELPRO Program aimed against these rockers was very real and was intending to destroy a movement they saw as subversive and connected to communism. Intel's interest in Jimi Hendrix is evidenced by his FBI file and its entries which indicated serious interest in him. Jimi was on the list of worst threats to the American government known as the ""Security Index"". His FBI file was similar to other known Index targets who were killed by FBI.

  So, while this is a pretty poorly made movie it does cover something that most people miss. Buchanan didn't get Jimi's murder exactly right but he was on the right track. He made the mistake of portraying the ambulance drivers as CIA spooks who murdered Jimi in the ambulance. Later discoveries showed they were innocent people who just did their job but witnessed important evidence. Buchanan also made the mistake of portraying Monika Dannemann as a helpless victim when those same discoveries showed she was the one with dark involvement.  Never the less, he was close to the truth and exposed something very dangerous and unknown at the time. Typically, the public not only didn't notice but they attacked him for his brave attempt at exposing some of America's most evil secrets.

Joe Bob Briggs used to have a review column in a zine.  The title of the publication escapes me, but I've always been a fan of Joe Bob & it was in this underground format that I learned about the movie 'Beyond the Doors'.  This movie attempts to explain the premature demises of three prominent rock musicians: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Jopin & Jim Morrison.  This was not director Larry Buchanan's first foray into this style of movie.  He previously directed two movies about Marilyn Monroe's private life as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trial-of-Lee-Harvey-Oswald/dp/B0000CG8H1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald</a>.

The movie is not really about the Doors.  In fact, of the three musicians, Morrison's character is given the least amount of screen time.  The movie attempts to show a government conspiracy to eliminate ""roadblocks"" to Nixon's reelection (the movie's terms).  The three rock musicians were selected because of their appeal to America's youth.  This is tied into FBI head J Edgar Hoover who at that time was conducting the infamous COINTELPRO operation against dissident groups.  The details of COINTELPRO are well known to students of alternative politics in this country, and while it did target Hollywood figures such as Jean Seberg it is less clear that musicians were investigated as thoroughly.  It should be pointed out, however, that many of the COINTELPRO targets were smeared and intimidated but only a limited number of them were actually murdered.  The movie specifically mentions William C Sullivan, an FBI intelligence officer who later wrote a tell all about his time in the Bureau.  Sullivan died in a hunting accident in 1977.

Of the movie's characters, Jimi Hendrix is the most likely target due to the fact that he had met with persons affiliated with the Black Panthers (who were being heavily monitored).  His encounter with the Panthers is referred to in the movie.  The movie suggests that the rock stars were slipped some bad drugs.  Of course all three rock stars had used copius quantities of narcotics & alcohol so an early death could just as easily have been a consequence of this lifestyle.

This movie is an interesting experiment in that it is attempting to present a conspiracy theory to a teen audience (most of Larry Buchanan's movie were directed at young people).  Does it succeed as entertainment?  Fans of the three artists will probably find the imitation music to be unimpressive but the guy who plays Jimi Hendrix does a pretty good impression.  It may not be the most compelling drama but it beats Jomo & the Smoothies.

8167493,2,B000MAEXZ6,"A film that suggests Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were all murdered by an interlinked conspiracy, but offers little in the way of hard proof to back up this claim. The three legendary musicians/singers are portrayed by actors performing songs ""in the style of"" Jimi, Janis and Jim. So not only is there no footage of the actual musicians performing, but none of their actual music is to be heard, either. The actors provide what boils down to impressions of the dead legends, with varied results. Suppose this may be interesting if viewed following a few bongloads, but short of that, not so much.",1175472000,2,612,4.783018867924528
