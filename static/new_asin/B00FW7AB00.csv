Redlegs isn't perfect by any means, there are a lot of issues in terms of storytelling (like why do we need the girls there besides looking pretty?) but the drama, the message and the environment shines in its own way - even as gritty as the material gets.

If you like buddy films, guys figuring out what to do after the loss of a friend, and Cincinnati, definitely give it a look. My friend Gad plays the guy who died. It was great to have the back of my head in one of the shots too. Check it out, you may be surprised. It certainly is a different type of film and at around an hour in length, it isn't quite feature-esque feeling, but not just a short either. Go Redlegs!",1496880000,,840,4.217391304347826
8618872,2,B00FW7AB00,"I am always sad to write a review for a film I watched going in with expectations. Because I never do that to begin with. As a critic for my university journals review and now vast freelance, I believe in honesty above all. As I have never bashed a film, I indie, blockbuster, or otherwise. I must say, I am terribly disappointed by this film. A solid story drawn out climaxing within the final ten minutes. It was like someone's first time who had dreamed of sensations so strong their body would register beyond euphoria but instead, even with an emotional connection of visceral proportion they are left unsatisfied on a hard mattress with only a street lamp lighting an empty room.

There is no need to discuss storyline here, it is non existent and rushed, rushed yet delayed.

I saw hope in a flailing indie industry within the depths of the vulnerable eyes of Evan Louison. For I cannot decide which of his talents I long for more. The raw and revealing nature of his writing, the ominous grit of his music lulled by the timbre of his soulful yet youthful voice, or in his acting for which I was introduced to first. If it it is Louison that captured you in this unfortunate but one dimensional flicker, seek and find Buttercup Bill or one of his shorts. Someone to watch indeed. And as for this first attempt a single brava is given where none should be. If it were not for the cardio infarction playing as the credits came and went, this review would read far different.",1484438400,,1479,4.4944237918215615
