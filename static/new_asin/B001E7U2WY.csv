Probably are NOT already believers in the inerrancy of the Word of God. BUT THIS may
Help you with that problem;  do you think that all the historians of the ancient past were LIARS ?
Never mind the Bible, if you like . I used to wonder how could peoples who thought themselves so well educated write like they
Actually BELIEVED in giants, earthly women
MARRYING the gods who lived on Mt Olympus,
Etc.  Start investigating these ""myths"" as if some
How they might be true...... Since every
Civilization with a written language wrote about the very same things happening around them.
They weren't MAKING UP the same stories all over the world! They were ALL writing about

That the ""ancient ones"" had passed down to the
Tribe that they used to hunt with a ""GIANT"". He
Ran ahead of the hunting party as they chased
