4892132,5,B005TQACLC,"I saw this live this summer in Houston and even met Britney Backstage. The show was so amazing and full of energy. it was truly magnificent. There were even live pre recorded vocals!!!! the live vocals won't all fully be on the blu ray unfortunately, but its still a great show and i cant wait to recieve my copy!!!",1320364800,7,315,4.3559322033898304
4892133,5,B005TQACLC,"Britney Spears' Femme Fetale concert was amazing. She had a great mix of songs and some of the songs include Baby One More Time, The Big Fat Base, Til the World Ends, How We Roll, Hold It Against Me, Up and Down, If You Seek Amy, plus several other songs. Her costumes were amazing as ever and so were her special effects. She really kept the crowd entertained throughout the entire concert. I also loved how her concert told a story with the videos that were shown before some of the songs. My ONLY regret about this concert is that it wasn't long enough :)

If you are a fan of Britney Spears then you have to add this blu ray to your collection.",1320278400,6,648,4.225806451612903

4892136,5,B005TQACLC,"Britney at her best these days! This show was really spectacular live when I saw it in Miami, and I expect the DVD to reflect all the glory! Yes she's not the sparkling dance diva she once was, but I was impressed and can't wait for this to come out on blu-ray... Go for it, you'll enjoy!",1320105600,13,288,4.0701754385964914
4892137,1,B005TQACLC,"Alot Of editing went into this Show to make her look Interesting. Originally Broadcast on EPIX CH, Now released on Dvd, It has the excitement of a High School Talent Show. She was once a good dancer but Now she always seems lost on stage with NO stage presence. Whatever Medication she's on... She needs to quit. Furthermore The Entire concert is Lip Synched. Why waste money when you can just listen to the record???
Not worth the money. Unless you're still in High School",1320105600,16,473,4.576470588235294

4892141,4,B005TQACLC,"What Can I say, It's Britney Bitch! Don't get why they didn't use her real vocals though. I went to this concert and she sang live for the majority, also a few performances were cut from it. Disappointing at her company for doing that. Let the hear her voice cause we loved it",1428883200,,276,4.226415094339623
4892142,4,B005TQACLC,"It's a good concert, she performed all of my favorites. But why did they edit her vocals to sound like she's lip-syncing? I could tell she wasn't because a lot of parts you could faintly hear her natural voice because they dubbed over the studio recordings. It's good, but I just wish they didn't do that.",1425600000,,305,4.464285714285714

4892145,5,B005TQACLC,I love the song remixes used on her Femme Fatale tour. They are better than the original songs in my opinion. This is her best concert and has so many of her hit songs. A must own for any Britney fan!,1417478400,,200,3.902439024390244

4892153,1,B005TQACLC,"Did Britney realize this show was being filmed because she completely phoned in her performance???!!! It was a complete train wreck. If you're going to lip sync through an entire show, the least you can do is tear up choreography. No such luck. It's like the girl completely forgot how to dance.

4892158,1,B005TQACLC,"Frankly, I expected more from Britney. an early fan of hers, I've followed her work closely for years...until today.

This video is absolutely hideous.

Not only was her styling was atrocious, her face looked constipated and she pretty much sat the entire show.  She may be depressed",1396569600,,283,4.9787234042553195

4892160,4,B005TQACLC,It is really cool bur there are some errors in the menu like the names of the songs are wrong but is a good concert,1388620800,,115,3.64
4892161,3,B005TQACLC,"Visually, it was very boring. The first half felt like I was going through a powerpoint presentation. The performances felt kinda rush and fast paced at times. Her dancing wasn't all that stellar. Her dancers had more energy and effort than her which is sad. After since her breakdown and having kids, her dancing and personality haven't been the same. The good news is her personality seems like it's slowly coming back based on what I saw on ""I Am Britney Jean"". I personally wouldn't go out to watch Britney in concert. Her performance skills are just not interesting and are lifeless. She's not on the same level as Beyonce or Janet when it comes to that aspect. Her dancing and her movements remind me of Madonna except that Madonna has more energy and her shows are usually more visually stunning. The middle part and I guess the few last parts were somewhat interesting. The lap dance gave me Janet teas but even that doesn't even comes close to Janet's. I think the only thing she had going on here were the outfits, the songs, and her body. That's about it. I think The Onyx Hotel one remains her best one. I don't remember ever feeling bored while watching it. I think Circus seems a tad bit better too. Too bad those tours are not the ones that got the DVDs. Such a pity.",1388188800,,1282,4.482905982905983
4892162,5,B005TQACLC,"I was lucky enough to see the Femme Fatale Tour live and I LOVED IT! With a setlist to die for, even Britney haters will be caught tapping their foot to these killer beats. That being said, the show itself does not film well. Maybe it's the way it was edited, the audio, the camera angles, who knows, but the Epix DVD version pales in comparison to the live concert experience. For better concert DVDs look up Live from Las Vegas (the Dream Within a Dream Tour) and Live from Miami (the Onyx Hotel Tour). While those are better DVDs, Femme Fatale was overall her best tour, combining remixed old songs with addictive new ones from her 2011 album of the same name.",1381795200,,663,4.3983739837398375
4892163,3,B005TQACLC,"Looking at this for just a ""fun factor,"" the Femme Fatale tour DVD is a good choice to buy. The sets are huge and almost omnipresent, Britney and her backup dancers have obviously rehearsed the dance steps, and songs from throughout her career are featured here, not just ones from a certain time.

However, it is obvious that in post-production, Brit's live vocals were either mostly taken out, or they just put the song vocals over Brit's live ones. Why? That is just such an insult to her fans. At least some of her songs have some live vocals coming thru, and hey what do ya know, she sounds good.

The actual live vocals can explain the somewhat-disappointing dance moves and the choreography that accompany them. Some songs have dances better than others (3, How I Roll stand out as being the most fun/classic numbers; Britney herself seems happiest performing How I Roll, too). But overall, Brit's big new songs, Hold It Against Me and Til The World Ends are great songs with crappy dances. Britney herself seemed out of it and stiff in the HIAM opener, and the moves themselves for TTWE just weren't my style.

Most songs included featured either a remixed version or some new intros. Props, they came across well. I'm not sure if I cared for the backup dancers; they were talented and who knows how much time had to be put into the fitness training they underwent. But too often they're moves were more energetic/exaggerated than Britney's, which takes away from the purpose: that she is the star and the others are there to make her look better. But then again, Britney didn't exactly put on a dancing clinic, either.

Still though, this is Britney which means it's more or less a blast to watch. There's just something about her stage presence that puts her in that upper echelon.",1380672000,,1791,4.6761904761904765
4892164,5,B005TQACLC,"Love Love Love IT!!!
(although she could
Performed a couple more of her old stuff thrown in! But still phenomenal!!!!",1378771200,,117,4.9
4892165,5,B005TQACLC,"I rated this DVD 5 stars, not because of the actual DVD, but for the sake of the overall tour. As most have already cited, the editing and overall presentation EPIX passed off as the finished version of this DVD is laughable and in the end, damages the nostalgia and any positives the Femme Fatale tour offered. For starters, everybody is aware that Britney though not necessarily incapable of doing so, has not displayed herself as the performer she once was. I say this as a fan and do so not expecting others to follow suit, but I believe Britney has the potential to be every bit the performer she was in her prime. I've read where several statements have been made by other members of her dancers camp saying, in her defense, that Britney is well beyond capable of tearing it up in rehearsals, it's her own issues with her self confidence that lead her astray come show time. Many have come to her defense, claiming her lackluster stage performance comes on the heels of knee injury and 2x over, childbirth. I call BS and do so as a diehard fan. In 2007, a good span of time before her breakdown and forced psychiatric restraint, Britney attempted a comeback of sorts, performing a series of stripped back performances as part of a gig with the House of Blues. At the time, she had not long given birth to her second child, and while not in the best physical shape, she executed nearly flawless choreography reminiscent of that of her pre-breakdown days. The issue with Britney's abilities now comes by her own show of strength. I'm only guessing, but seeing as how Britney still remains under almost total control of her father via conservatorship, her lackluster behavior is as expected. She doesn't feel free and isn't merited to be such on her own, not entirely. The reins have let up some in recent months and judging by what I've seen and heard of her, she's closer to 'real' Britney as she's ever been. Her next album is on it's way and appears to be piggybacking loads of promise. Britney is in control and is doing it the way she wants an important element said to have been missing during the Femme Fatale era. I've read, she was fed up and had become disinterested in the project and the direction it was taking. That transcended to the stage. With that said, the Femme Fatale Tour while not her best, was not represented how it could've been. The videos I watched on YouTube offer an entirely contrasting view than that of Epix's portrayal. It's because of these proofs that the Femme Fatale tour and Britney are not failures, the DVD is just shoddy quality. For those of you borderline giving up on her, be patient, album 8 is coming and is said to be personal out the tail pipe. Britney Spears is not over by a long shot! As far as advising for against buying or not buying the DVD, it's purely your choice. I did before I realized it's errors. It's not perfect, but it's not an utter waste of life either. I recommend checking into the tour on YouTube regardless.",1377043200,,2983,4.525925925925926
4892166,1,B005TQACLC,I thought this would be interesting but it wasn't.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  Waste of money. Junk.,1375660800,,114,4.65
4892167,5,B005TQACLC,"It must be tiring for people to hate on her but they are still checking her out. Hate it for ya, if you're a hater, you're a fan. I believe this is a really good concert. She did an awesome job! She is still in front of a crowd giving it her best and it shows through her success from the beginning of her career till now. Her fans are her drive and that includes the haters. She has never let me down yet. Even when everyone talked about her VMA performance in 07, I still watched it. There are so many performers these days who could sing live through the whole show but that wouldn't keep me entertained. Britney loves her fans, who in turn love her back and that is why she is highest on the totem pole for my favorite of all time.

Be sure to check this out! It is simply amazing what she can do. Pretty as a picture and Southern as sweet tea. Love always Britney!!",1372032000,,870,4.058139534883721
4892168,5,B005TQACLC,"Love Britney Spears! She's sexy and entertained. This concert movie is just great! The songs, Britney, dancers... everything on stage it's simply PERFECT! When I was watching it I felt like if I was in the concert and I really enjoyed it.  Good job!  :)",1371945600,,253,4.6
4892169,1,B005TQACLC,"I watched this on Netflix, and it was AWFUL! I have been a Britney fan in the past, but I don't think I want to fan over somebody who lip synchs, and can BARLEY even dance. She looked lazy, her facial expressions were awful, her speeches and screams were terrible, too. Garbage! DON'T BUY!",1369785600,4,289,4.37037037037037
4892170,5,B005TQACLC,This tour was not my favorite of Britney's ICONIC tours but it was a lot of fun! It is great to see that she was able to pick herself up and continue to dominate the pop world. We went and saw the Femme Fatale Tour twice in Chicago and we had a blast! Britney fans will be pleased.,1364774400,,281,3.8620689655172415
4892171,5,B005TQACLC,"So ive been a lifelong fan of Britney since day one. I had pervously seen her ""The Circus starring Britney Spears"" tour back in 2009 and knew i had to go see her again!
I went to this tour 3 times in the space of 4-5 days. Twice in London, once in Birmingham and can i just say i LOVED it the more i went to see it! i didn't get bored which is what you would expect seeing the same show that short in time over again.
Once the tour had finished, i hoped that Britney would release it on DVD (Whch i also think she should have done for the Circus tour as a Circus is a show in itself!) and to my delight, she did!

This DVD is amazing because i get to experience the show over and over again and what makes it even better is that you get a BONUS CD OF REMIXES!
So if you want to watch this tour, or relive it, then GET THIS DVD!!",1363737600,,828,3.786127167630058
4892172,5,B005TQACLC,Britney never fails to put on a great show! I saw her Circus Tour show and it was amazing and this one was just as good.,1361923200,,120,3.6538461538461537
4892173,1,B005TQACLC,"I would have given this a zero rating if possible! This DVD is a complete and total utter piece of garbage! The choreography is off key and bad. She is very stiff and barely dancing other than a few poorly coordinated movements and the WORST OF ALL...she is LIP SYNCING!!!! This is totally unacceptable! I understand that Brit is one of those studio artists but I would have preferred to hear her voice a little unsteady or poorly controlled than the studio track over crappy choreography! I'm disappointed because I love Brit and her music since ""Bay One More Time"" and her comeback from the bipolar breakdown was commendable but this is not her standard whatsoever. I'll still buy her cd's because her music is very upbeat simple dancey pop. No ballads or deep moving music. Just fun upbeat dance clubbing with friends. The DVD was painful to watch. I couldn't even make it through the first set. I will be demanding my refund as well as all of us who wasted $15. It would be great if we could all file a class action lawsuit to demand a ban on the sale of this fraudulent p.o.s.",1360627200,5,1081,4.49238578680203

4892177,2,B005TQACLC,"She's better saved for produced videos with a lot of CG and professional dancers intercut.

Live, she barely moves, lip syncs (of course) and needs help even stepping down from a 2 step staircase!

She'd occasionally wave her arms and make some attempts at a dance move here or there, but there were no moments where you thought she was accomplishing more than any teenage girl dancing in her bedroom mirror.",1358294400,,408,4.732394366197183
4892178,2,B005TQACLC,"I used to love Britney and her performances but COME ON, this tour and DVD are blatant ""grab-the-money-and-go"" clunkers.  She barely seems interested at all and seems to hand-dance in slow motion. She used to be a powerhouse performer (even if she never actually sang) but gone are the wicked-hot dance moves and unshakable confidence. She barely moves her lower body and is in pretty bad shape. The entire production looks cheap, from the costumes to her jacked-up hair extensions.  Sad to see a former superstar just going through the motions (barely) so she can make some more money.  I'm pretty much a former Britney fan at this point.",1356480000,,639,4.844036697247707
4892179,5,B005TQACLC,"I really loved this concert. Britney is great as usual. I don't understand why people thought that they covered her life voice? She is obviously singing life. You can hear the difference between CD sound and this concert sound. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and think that every Britney's fan would too. It's one of my favorite DVDs for workout.

She remarked that Britney seemed to be walking through the show and how little Britney put into the performance when compared to her back-up dancers. If you put out a concert dvd, you want to make sure that it's the artist's best performance. Unfortunately, this isin't it.",1354147200,,417,4.805555555555555
4892182,4,B005TQACLC,"Just like everyone else said, the concert is great and Britney looks awesome but she sounds like she was dubbed.

We all know that she can't sing live but now she can't even dance too. So, what else she can do? The true Britney is gone since before Gimme more but this is worse. I'm buying this for my collection but i finally know that is just a trash.",1347667200,2,356,3.8904109589041096
4892184,3,B005TQACLC,"The production was done really well and I've always been a fan of Britney, so I was enjoying the music. There was a lot of flashiness and props used, the only issue I had was Britney. It seemed as if she was lip syncing everything, which I don't have a problem with if she's dancing.

However, she didn't dance like she used to a few years ago. I know that things have changed, but there was one thing I always counted on it was her awesome dance skills. Her backup dancers and the stage productions were done really well, so it kind of filled the gap.

It was okay for me, only because I expected Britney to have the crisp dancing I remember. There was some good remixes of old favorites and even a cover of a Rihanna song that wasn't bad. There's also a surprise guest at the end, but I don't know how most will feel about that when they find out who it is.

Overall, watchable, but if you're looking for the old Britney, you're out of luck.",1347235200,,943,4.198895027624309

4892187,5,B005TQACLC,"I could not stop watching this concert. Maybe because I have waited so long for her to release a concert DVD. I mean, it is no Dream Within A Dream or Onyx dance wise but if you watch it for the sake of entertainment (not comparing it to the others that she have done.), you're gonna love it. Dream Within A Dream is by far the best Britney Spears concert dance and production wise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Britney-Spears-Live-from-Las-Vegas/dp/B00005UKKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Britney Spears - Live from Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;but this is my favorite. I mean, the set list (who would've thought that she would sing S$M) the stage (It is the best I've ever seen!) and Britney herself seem to be enjoying it. I am fine with them dubbing the show, I really am not fond of the crowd noise but during the Till The World Ends number - the music doesn't sync up with her lips on the last Chorus s it looks like she is lip-syncing badly. But overall, it is a great and spectacular show.

Hold It Against Me - the backdrop was so good. Her outfit kind of made her look fat though. The choreography is good. There is a little thing about the editing though (this show was shot for 2 nights), on the last Chorus of the song, you'll see that Brit was dancing while the screen at her back closes, then one scene it is still open. It is not noticeable though.

Up 'N Down - AT the end of HIAM, Brit was caught by the cops, this song opens with her and her female dancers in a cage. I like how she escape from it and her dancing here is on fire.

3 - And who said she can no longer dance????

Piece Of Me - they could have omitted this number IMO.

Big Fat Bass - not a fan of this song and I think, her dancer, Adrien Galo, stole the spotlight in this number.

How I Roll - love this song. The choreography is real cute.

Lace And Leather - Brit giving a lap dance to her stalker, I mean, fan... Alex.

If You Seek Amy - one of the better performances, simple yet effective.

Gimme More - the outfit shows off her figure. I wish this was the performance on the VMA '07.

Drop Dead Beautiful - I always laugh when Sabi pops out on the stage.

Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This is officially an Adrien Galo show. Lol.

Boys - nice concept.

Baby One More Time - the second audio option gives you the live version of the song. It is really nice to hear Brit's 2011 version of this epic song.

S&M - IMO Britney walks so gracefully, I have never seen any supermodel walk like that.

Trouble For Me - I love this! The choreography is sooooooo good. This is one of the best songs off of Femme Fatale, it was not given that much attention so I was surprised that it is on the set list.

Slave 4 U - Britney danced the original choreography, it is not the same as before, but at least she tried and it is really lovely to watch. Would've been better if they have not changed the vocals and put the 2000 track on.

I Wanna Go - this has taken the toll of the dubbing thing. I have seen a video on YouTube if this exact performance plus the live audio and it is so much better, you can hear the audience singing along (Okay, I take back what I said about the crowd noise.) I mean, this song suppose to have the audience interaction but they have taken it away.

Womanizer - My most favorite. This number was put up so well. The back flip is the heart of the performance, I mean, you cannot go to a Femme Fatale concert without taking a picture of Brit doing the back flip. You can see all the cameras round the arena during that epic moment. Britney has proven that she is still the ultimate performer.

Toxic - I am not a fan of this number. This is the one that I skip. I mean, why they had to remix this epic song? Oh, well... Because Brit cannot dance to the original version.

Till The World Ends - what a way to end the show, her best dancing the whole Femme Fatale era. And her angel wings??? Just wow.

I might have some not so good feedback but I am giving this 5 stars because it is Britney b*tch! (I know, I should get a life.)",1340755200,,4072,4.221649484536083
4892188,3,B005TQACLC,"I was seven years old when I first saw the video for ""...Baby One More Time."" From that moment on, I've been obsessed with this chick!! The awesome outfits, amazing dancing, flawless music, and her beauty! Who didn't fall in love?! I bought into the ""Britney Brand"" her and her management have created from day one. I stayed up to date with all the current Britney news and what not. I even stuck around when she married, had two kids, divorced, went a tad bit crazy, and returned to fame. I admit, she's not the same! In some ways, she's better! In others, she's not the same! I was first disappointed of the release of ""Blackout."" It has never been my favorite album. It's grown on me since, but I feel it's not up to par with her last efforts. Also, I don't care for ""dance music."" Her lack of promotion. I was disappointed that she just doesn't care anymore. I was very excited about ""Circus."" One of my favorite Britney albums. It was an actual pop album. Some catchy songs, some ballads, a general theme.  Completely disappointed by lack of promotion for that album as well! At first, she did interviews, performances, and came out of her shell a bit. Then she never did anything else with promotion besides the ""Circus Tour."" Let me tell you! That tour, I wanted to me absolutely amazed! I expected her dancing, high energy, and amazing smile. Nothing! Now, it's another ""dance album."" A bit better than ""Blackout,"" but even more auto tuned!? Seeing the videos on Youtube for ""The Femme Fatale Tour"" I was unbelievably impressed and relieved! She was dancing actual choreography! Singing live!!! Had a big more energy! When the dvd was released from Epix, I ran straight to the store! Watched the dvd a few times. Was satisfied even though the show was dubbed over. After a few watches, I became bored. The dvd is crap! I can't believe after ten years of not having a concert dvd, this is what we get! I'm almost to the point of never purchasing another Britney item again! Her next efforts have got to be fierce and flawless! This is coming from a HUGE fan! But I'm getting tired of this!!",1338854400,,2097,4.532981530343008
4892189,4,B005TQACLC,"Being a fan of Britney Spears that never had the finances needed to see her in live in concert, I was overjoyed when this DVD was announced. I saved up extra to buy the special edition including the remix CD. But I was a little disappointed by how everything was handled with this release.

First of all, let's address the elephant in the room: Britney's dubbed vocals. It's no secret that Brit Brit (dare I say) dabbles in lip synching, but judging by YouTube videos of this tour, she actually sang live for most of the show (if not all of it). On the DVD, however, EVERY SONG IS DUBBED. Epix released a statement claiming Britney made the decision to do so but I cry foul. Britney can actually sing, so why is she always covering it up?

Secondly, this was just shot very badly. There are certain moments when the camera cuts from Britney dancing to some group of people in the audience. Sure, that's all fine and dandy the first couple of times but it happens so often I swear I saw the same group of people three times! Not only that, but the shots of the audience were BLURRY!

Thirdly, the DVD menu COMPLETELY typo'd some song names. It's like no one in charge cared about the packaging. (Let's use the album cover AGAIN. Maybe they'll use it for her next album too?)

And a fourth critique is a small one: WHO IN THE NAME OF LIZA MINELLI STYLED BRITNEY'S HAIR??? Seriously, I think I should just call her Weaveny instead.

Those points aside, it was amazing to see Britney on top of the world again and it really looked as though she was enjoying herself. If it were any other artist, this would be getting two or three stars but because it's Britney, I'm giving it four.",1336867200,,1678,4.382636655948553
4892190,3,B005TQACLC,"I am a hardcore fan since Baby One More Time back in 1998.  I have loved her since.  The first concert I went to of hers was the Circus.  It was amazing, although I could tell it wasn't really live.  I've seen her Live from Las Vegas and Onyx Hotel tours.  Both were pretty amazing.  I went to the Femme Fatale tour last summer.  My friends and I didn't have great seats so I was hoping for Britney to run around the stage more and do more.  I may as well have just watched this DVD at home.  It seems she did more during the Circus tour.  I'm questioning whether to go to her next show, whenever it may be.  I went to Gaga's concert and she did a heck of a lot more.  I've also seen Adam Lambert on a tiny stage but his presence and voice just rocked the house.  Britney is not all about the voice but she is about dancing.  I don't like that she lip syncs; I'd rather her sing bad and dance her butt off.  At least you know it's live.  Also the ""what's up Toronto? I love you Toronto!"" seemed a bit fake; possibly pre-recorded.  Even calling the fan up on stage for Lace and Leather seemed off.  Britney just sat on the prop onstage while her dancers/back up singers did all the work picking.  Maybe it's just me but I would be so embarrassed hiding behind a recording track and lip syncing.  I would walk off the stage with my tail between my legs and I'm surprised Britney didn't.  I didn't give it a 1 star rating because I liked the show, it's just Britney seemed to be in the way or prevented the show from being 5 stars.  I love Britney but I wonder what is going on with her.  Supposedly she had 2 knee surgeries and that may be why she doesn't dance like she used to.  She also had 2 kids.  Madonna has been through a lot.  Heck, Mariah Carey had 2 kids and is still kicking onstage.  Beyonce was pregnant and doing shows.  So was Gwen Stefani.  Something else is going on here because of other performers can still kick butt while pregnant, after pregnant, surgeries, etc... then she can too.  Heck Michael Jackson went through hell and back and his last concert was better than ever!  Oh and he was dancing and it was live.  Britney I hope you fix whatever is wrong and can come back ""stronger than yesterday"" :)",1335225600,,2224,4.172169811320755

4892192,2,B005TQACLC,"I had the opportunity to attend Britney's concert in Chile in november, and I loved it... I had been waiting to see her in concert for 13 years, and it was just one of the best concerts of my life, and the one I paid the most to see. It was pure energy for 90 minutes, plus the fact that she did sing live in a LOT of the songs (not all of them), it was a fantastic concert. Well, after seeing her in concert, I got the DVD and was expecting to be amazed by the show one more time, but this is just a HORRIBLY made DVD.

Where to start..

1. The cameras are WAY too static and barely move and follow Britney and the dancers, it just makes it really boring, plus the angles are really bad, they're filming from above the stage, which just makes it look small, it's like watching a security camera footage! When you capture a live concert you want to get the excitement and the greatness of the stage and effects... Fail! Bottom line: the director should never work again and probably killed!!
2. The editing also plain sucks... I know my stuff since I go to film school, and whoever post-produced this concert was absolutely stoned or it was their first day at the job. The cuts are completely out of time, it just a visual mess they've created.
3. Dubbed vocals. For the first time ever (and I'm a huge Brit fan) I am 100% sure that she DOES sing live. The un-dubbed version of this concert was leaked and posted on YouTube and you can really tell the difference, but Epix, for some stupid reason, decided it was a good idea to replace ALL the vocals with the studio versions. Knowing that Britney sang live at the actual show, and that she is heavily criticized for her lipsyncing, it would have been amazing to hear her live vocals on the concert DVD.
4. The back cover looks like it was made by a 5 year old (not offending any 5-year olds!), the color is nowhere near similar to the ones used on the front cover or the Femme Fatale CD artwork. I have seen a billion fanmade covers online that are way prettier!
5. And finally, but not less important... ""Leather And Lace"" on the menu.. instead of the actual name of the song, ""Lace And Leather"".... REALLY?? This is Britney's second DVD with wrong song titles! You would think that for a release as anticipated as this one there would be some sort of Quality Control process... I guess not.

Having YouTube and my own recorded HD videos from the show I attended, I just prefer watching something else to remember this tour, to watch it and get excited and wanting to jump in my room. I just don't watch this DVD anymore. It's nowhere near as exciting and energetic as the ""Live From Las Vegas"" or ""Live And More"" DVDs.

Look for this concert on YouTube. If you see it and are satisfied with it and actually like it, then buy it. Honestly, I would have skipped it.",1333324800,,2816,4.297551789077213
4892193,1,B005TQACLC,"What a train wreck. I don't understand the myriad of good reviews! BS obviously screwed herself up so much she has to fill the stage with talented dancers, flashing lights and ridiculous props to distract you from the lip-synching and stiff dancing.

While I understand she's older and cannot move the way she used to, she dances worse than Madonna, but Madonna is effing 50-something! So I don't buy the age excuse. I'm thinking she's on medication for Bipolar Disorder making her movements stiff and uncoordinated looking. Could I do what she does? Nope, but damn sure, if I was getting paid untold amounts of money, I'd be like Madonna rocking it like nobody's business.

I felt bad for fans that paid outrageous ticket prices. Maybe now is the time for BS to try acting. Thank Goddess this was on Netflix and I didn't buy it.",1332547200,5,829,4.671232876712328
4892194,5,B005TQACLC,"Thank you. Great tour! Nice DVD, good seller! The next is Madonna :)
Ive been at Budapest to see her performance. Its great tour but i need old Britney :)
I bought this because I am a true fan and love all her work. You decide to buy it or not.",1328659200,,244,3.803921568627451
4892195,1,B005TQACLC,"Where do I begin with this concert Blu-ray/DVD? You know when you're left with questions after watching a concert Blu-ray/DVD that it's a failure all around. That's the only way to describe this travesty. Was there even a point of putting it on Blu-ray? Because you'd have to be both high and deaf to enjoy it? I'll never know.

Ok let's get down to it. The obvious being the lip-syncing. Why ignore the elephant in the room? I know this is pretty standard for Britney because she's done it her entire career but why did she make the decision to have her pre-recorded, or ""live"" vocals dubbed over? She would've gotten some credibility as people would believe she was singing live. And yes, it was Britney's decision, Epix released a statement stating that it was up to the artist. It begs the question as to why she'd want that. What's the point of being a singer if you don't like your voice or you don't want others to hear it? Why do fans have to fight tooth and nail just to hear you live? It's not like your albums aren't edited enough to where you sound robotic and unnatural. You're better of waiting for the demos and stems to leak. What adds insult to injury are the 30 seconds in total, performances with Sabi and Nicki Minaj which had more live singing than from Britney and it was her concert/tour. Also, does Britney and her team think we're stupid? They dubbed over 'Baby One More Time' and 'Slave 4 u' with the album vocals, you're talking vocals from albums that are over a decade old. I give up.

The dancing, more like what dancing? Whipping your hair isn't dancing, Willow Smith does that and still sings live. ""arm dancing"" isn't dancing either. I used to be able to defend Britney and say ""she dances really hard and therefore it's ok if she lip-syncs"". These days she does neither. I gave her a major break during Circus because it was her first tour in 5 years and she went through a lot leading up to it. I've run out of excuses and can't and won't defend this.

Epix and team Britney really dropped the ball as well. The cover, really? That took a lot of consideration to use the album cover. I hope they didn't think too hard with that decision. The image on the disc itself was much better. When you go to the menu and hit ""song selection"" they messed up a few song titles as well. It's 'Lace and Leather' not 'Leather and Lace', it's also 'Trouble For Me' not 'Trouble'. Did they not pay any attention at all? There's parts where they pan to the audience and it looks pixelated and choppy. And what's with the image on the back cover, the top left B&W photo? That looks like a photo backstage, prayer circle before the show perhaps? That's not on the Blu-ray/DVD or part of the show. Is that an indication that there was extras to be included originally?

In short, like I said, there's questions, and there shouldn't be while watching a concert. In my opinion, the only thing that was done correctly and would make it worthwhile are the Music Videos for each single released. And even that's not on the DVD. If you don't have Blu-ray you're screwed. What I gathered from this? Britney doesn't want to do this anymore and her team hates us all. Don't be the last to know....that this is a waste of time and money.",1328486400,12,3242,4.425460636515913
4892196,2,B005TQACLC,"I got this video for my girlfriend who is a diehard Britney Spears fan.  Even though she staunchly defends her idol, even she cannot deny that Britney has lost the flair she once had for her line of work.  She not longer does the complicated dance moves she once did; instead, she continues to favor switching dancing roles with her backup dancers.  Most pop-stars do the most impressive dancing during stage shows and music videos.  The backup dancers accent the dance moves but never outshine the star.  At concerts and even in her videos Britney does little more than walk and provide a minor hip-shake.  Her dancers will sometimes carry her or move her back and forth with some contraption, but the rest of the time they quite literally dance circles around the once shining star.  Oh, and let's not forget that she rarely if ever sings at her concerts.  Fans pay good money to see Britney lip-sync to her CDs.

I think most of her fans realize that the work she had done in the past was excessively hard.  She set the bar so high in her early career that even she can't reach it anymore.  No reasonable person would blame her for getting tired.  Heck, I don't even blame her for loosing the flair for the business.  She's taken way more crap than she deserves and she's worked hard to get where she is.  However, if you're a pop star and you don't want to dance anymore, you don't want to sing at your concerts, you don't write 90% of your songs, and you don't play an instrument, then it's time to get out of the business.",1328227200,5,1528,4.43010752688172
4892197,5,B005TQACLC,"I think ""Femme Fatale"" is Britney's strongest CD that you can choreograph many dances to through most of the CD, ESP ""I Wanna Go"" and ""Trouble For Me"". This DVD of her tour in Toronto is even better. ""3"" ""Trouble For Me"" and ""S&M"" make the whole concert worth buying, but the rest make it impossible to buy later on. There are only 2 downsides to this DVD for me. The biggest is that the concert IS dubbed, so it does sound more like her CDs, which I understand and appreciate when dancing to it, but it really sucks because I can never see her LIVE. The other downside is that ""Criminal"" and a few other songs were removed from the setlist BEFORE this was filmed, so if you are looking for those perfomances like I am, you will be severely disappointed. Overall, I would buy this again anytime I could afford it, and I watch it 3-5 times a week.",1327708800,,846,4.260869565217392

I loved the concert when I went and saw it in Portland, and I can tell you at our stop she sang live to nearly every song, it was amazing, but this DVD is kind of saddening to me since they take her live vocals and just throw most of them out the window. Despite this though, this DVD was amazing. I watched it and it really rushed back the feeling of going to this concert, and now I can experience it over and over again. Overall I really do enjoy this DVD! And to everyone whining because there aren't any bonus features, get over it. The concert itself should be enough, it certainly was for me.

She even gives us a surprising little known song, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, which is performed flawlessly and beautifully on a swing in the air.  One of the highlights for me.

4892202,5,B005TQACLC,"""Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour"" is a strong concert dvd that showcases the musical hits from the ""Circus"" and ""The Femme Fatale"" cd collections. I attended one of her fun concerts over five months ago, and was curious to see how this concert dvd would compare.  She gave a great live performance, and watching this version exceeded my expectations of what I had set.  The following are some of the various interesting moments of this dvd:

If U Seek Amy: The dancers were cleverly simulating the paparrazi.  Britney Spears was wearing a Marilyn Monroesque skirt during the performance.

Gimme More: There was a unique Egyptian theme and she was wearing gold to keep with the theme (a golden two-piece).

Drop Dead Gorgeous: The dancers are seen positioning themselves in gold frames, and singer Sabi makes a guest appearance.  Sabi is also known for appearing with Cobra Starship in their music video of ""You Make Me Feel"" (including lending her vocals to ""You Make Me Feel"")

I Wanna Go: There is a good group sequence of the dancers carefully timing their moves with Britney Spears.

Nicki Minaj appears towards the end of the concert.

There is also a remixed cd with this edition, but I admit to liking the concert dvd portion more.  However, I only wish that at least one to two bonuses were included.  ""Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour"" is recommended for anyone who enjoys her songs from the"" Femme Fatale collection"" and/or liked any live concerts from the ""Femme Fatale"" tour.",1326499200,2,1508,4.824902723735408
4892203,5,B005TQACLC,"Instinctively, I keep reaching for and playing this regularly.

While it is true that her vocals do sound incredibly processed, Femme Fatale is one video you might want to consider if you like shows by Cher, kylie, Madonna and Lady Gaga.

Femme Fatale employs the concert spectacular formula - stage, costumes and sets designed to blow you away along with a big cast of dancers and acrobats. In this case , the only absentees are the band, making the music seem all pre-recorded. Nevertheless, it's still a fantastic mix from start till finish.

While her Las Vegas DVD showcased Britney's hits up to her third album, Femme Fatale featured songs mostly from her new CD of the same name, with some from Blackout and Circus. Old gems are not forgotten. Toxic gets accelerated and Boys received an Egyptian opening.

What really got me going was Hold It Against Me, Till The World Ends and I Wanna Go - the last number had me putting my hands in the air and going Oh! Oh! Oh!...

Generally, singers who dance vigorously will be also breathing heavily. Somehow, I don't see or hear that here. Well, I'll give Britney the benefit of a doubt as I would have been on my feet all night had I attended the real thing!",1326412800,2,1208,4.548387096774194

I am a huge Britney fan but I was nervous about the show because I didn't want to think that I had spent that much money to hear the woman lip sync. I was SO pleasantly surprised that for over 60% of the concert you could hear her way louder than the backtrack. Unfortunatly, people at EPIX apparently wanted to add fuel to the criticisms about her not singing live by releasing a DVD that was COMPLETELY dubbed over by the Femme Fatale CD vocals.

The DVD, however, is totally lackluster.

There is no reason why a good director/editor couldn't edit this show to be much more exciting and high-energy. Instead, Britney appears slow and disinterested in the entire performance. Also she looks like she is completely off in her lip-synching, which is ridiculous because even if she WASN'T lip-synching perfectly live, the editor should have been able to match her lips up to the audio track.",1325548800,2,499,5.0
4892207,4,B005TQACLC,"We can all admit it ... There's something about Britney Spears that just keeps you interested. As a country, we watched her rise and fall, harder than most celebrities ever do. We then got the privilege of watching her return, and while her 2008 comeback album 'Circus', and the tour in support of it were mediocre at best, we still praised Britney for a triumphant return. We let the fact that she hasn't been at her peak since 2004 slip out of importance ... but NOW, after the mediocre comeback, the stakes were higher than ever for Britney in 2011. I'll admit, I've been a fan since the 6th grade. Since the first time I saw her prance around in that school-girl outfit. I've loved Britney as a person, not as a performer, so i'm happy to see that in her personal affairs, she seems to be much, much happier this year. However, as a performer, she's slipped and fallen .... HARD.

'Femme Fatale' is actually some of Britney's finest work, despite the fact that she had absolutely nothing to do with it. 'The Femme Fatale Tour' is a much needed burst of improvement since 2008 as well, though unfortunately, she's still missing the mark.

This tour and DVD are a whole ton of fun. Flirty outfits, great back-up dancers, sexy choreography, and great music .... the only bummer is that the WEAKEST part of this show, is Britney herself. Britney manages to improve upon her 2008 Circus Tour by actually conversing with the audience this time around, which let's face it, she barely did at all the last time around. The bummer here is that she's still not putting much effort into the dancing, and the lip-syncing is just getting more and more embarrassing. In a world where Lady GaGa and Adele are both live singers, and selling out shows, the stakes are high, and Britney is missing the mark.

Songs like 'I'm a Slave 4 U','Toxic', 'Baby One More Time', and 'Till The World Ends' are all great hits ... and frankly, the fact that she lip-syncs them doesn't even offend me. It's the fact that the live tracks for some of these songs are literally ripped right off of the album, and are obviously fake. See most pop stars obviously use a live backing track, the thing is those pop-stars at least take the time to pre-record those live vocals. The bummer with the 'Femme Fatale Tour', is that Britney didn't take that time at all. This show feels rushed, and not quite as well plotted out as it could be.

The DVD itself is a total let-down unfortunately because it doesn't have any kind of behind-the-scenes work at all. The fact is though, you're only paying $13.99 for it. If you want all the extras, look at the Blu Ray, which features interviews, rehearsal footage, music videos and more.

Britney is a great burst of energy on stage, and she's always been fun to watch. Plus, make no mistake, this show had the potential to be one of her greatest ever. If you can get passed the obvious lip-synching and not so impressive choreography, then you might just see that fact.

Pros: Great Costumes, Energetic back-up dancers, fantastic show lighting, and theme.
Weakest Link: Britney miming every single song.",1325376000,2,3108,4.61121157323689
4892208,3,B005TQACLC,"She looks great!  However, I was disappointed.  Would have rather previewed this by renting it before I bought it.  Love the bonus videos on the menu but it is the LEAST Britney and her producers could do for her fans who bought this Bluray.  It didn't bother me that the concert chosen for the Bluray was low live vocals over recorded tracks.  She does that because she has to dance through all of her songs and no artist could sing live and dance like she does without lip syncing.  Not without being deprived of oxygen anyway.  What bothered me is the fact that there was NO spontaneity, or like one reviewer said, no connection with her audience (at least not for this particular live performance).  The scene in which she does bring an ""audience member"" on stage seems totally preconceived.  I wonder if the guy was really picked at random or whether he was an actor who was hired.  The performance of ""If U Seek Amy"" was unintentionally laughable because she couldn't keep up with her choreographed moves.  It was rushed and irritating.  The whole show was like watching an elaborate and lengthy video.  It was too dry, rehearsed, and over-choreographed.  She was too standoffish with her audience and if I were a fan who paid for this particular concert, I would have been a little PO'd. Lastly, the concert was way too short to have been totally worth it.  Sorry Britney, either you could have done a better show, or at least chosen one from another city for release.

4892224,5,B005TQACLC,"I finally got my hands on this amazing DVD of Britney's latest tour ""Femme Fatale"" & I can't stop watching it. I'm a huge Britney fan & I think she killed it on this DVD. My favorite performances are ""Hold It Against Me"", ""Up N' Down"", ""How I Roll"", ""Gimme More"", ""(Drop Dead) Beautiful"", ""If U Seek Amy"", ""S&M"", ""Trouble For Me"" & ""Till The World Ends"". Nicki Minaj & Sabi also make special appearances during the show which is amazing. I do have some things I would like to say though especially to those who are writing negative reviews. I'm so tired of hearing people point out that Britney lip syncs. First of all, Britney has always lip synced for most of her performances. If you haven't accepted that by now, then there's no reason why you should have even bought this DVD or watched it. Us true Britney fans know that she does sing live sometimes & when she doesn't, we're okay with it because we know what her voice sounds like, we know that she's talented & we know she's going to put on one hell of a show. Plus you'd be surprised at all the other big artists out there that lip sync or sing to a backing track like Britney does most of the time. She did sing with a backing track during this show but the vocals were dubbed over for some reason. You can hear her in several parts of the show. Also, I'm tired of people saying that Britney can't dance like she used to. So what?! She's 30 years old now, she's had 2 kids which DOES change your body but she knows how to work what she's got & put on an amazing show. I was really impressed with alot of her dance moves & how much confidence she's finally showing again. I saw her on her Circus tour & she was amazing but you could tell she was a little nervous. Here, she's not nervous at all & she looks so happy. And to whoever commented that her dancers outshine her during ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", I really don't know what performance you were watching because she did the choreography perfectly & kept up with them at all times. She is Britney Spears, she's broken countless records, sold out countless shows & stayed on top for almost 15 years. She's a legend & an icon & if you're a Britney fan, you'll love this DVD. If you can't move past the lip syncing thing or the dancing thing, you just need to stop paying attention to Britney & find something else to do with your time.",1324080000,3,2340,4.225446428571429

Yet, this one is really entertaining and worth watching.  I also agree with the other reviewers about covering her live vocals, that took greatly from enjoying the whole concert experience because we only get to listen to snippets from her live vocals while the recorded tracks dominated the stage.

4892228,3,B005TQACLC,"Well it isn't the ""Onyx Hotel Tour"" filmed by Showtime.....however I expected more from this taping...

There's only two offending causes for me:

The Audio: The producers decided to be lazy and simply cut and paste the cd tracks onto the DVD because they sound identical...they could have at least tweaked them a bit to make them sound ""acoustic"" but nope, Instead we get  video footage with horrible cd track dubbing.

The quality: Am I wrong to expect HD quality???? I mean it was professionally shot, was it not?? Yet, the quality is as good as a VHS?? How is that even possible with today's technology?? Also, if you look carefully you can see that they mixed ""professional"" shots with shots taken during the concert (you know the one's they show on the screen for the cheap seats) because the quality gets worse.....e.g in ""Hold it against me"" when she's in the chair the quality gets blurry and smoky??? or maybe that was just a bad effect?

Besides those factors, it's an ok DVD, but it's sad that the bootleg Las Vegas video online is better....this DVD DOES NOT do it justice...This concert was breathtaking live!! so glad I saw it in Chicago and Milwaukee :-)",1322956800,3,1170,4.660194174757281
4892229,2,B005TQACLC,"When I first learned that Britney was going to tour, I got myself pumped to shell out big dollars to see the Femme Fatale tour because I figured she'd put on a great show. I had saw Beyonce, U2, Janet Jackson and several other major music concerts around the same time as Britney was touring and I just had to add Britney to my list. What I didn't know was that to sit in almost an identical location for the Femme Fatale concert as I did at Beyonce's  I Am tour, the Femme Fatale price was significantly higher, as in another minimum $100. So I decided if I can't get good seats, I won't go. So for months, I'm trapped in DVD Land, patiently waiting and hoping that the Femme Fatale concert will become available on DVD. I became a Britney Femme Fatale DVD Stalker. Guess what? Now only was it available on DVD, it was available in Blu-ray! Talk about being frantic, I quickly pre-ordered the Femme Fatale Blu-ray and waited for it to arrive. Then I read a few comments about Britney lip syncing and after some thought, I changed the Blu-ray to DVD.

The DVD came yesterday and I rushed home, turned on the big HDEF TV, kicked up the surround sound, made popcorn, turned off all of the lights because I knew that this concert was going to be fierce and I wanted to ""live"" in it. Well, all I can write is that I'VE BEEN HAD! I'VE BEEN TOOK! LED ASTRAY! RUN AMUCK! HOODWINKED! BAMBOOZLED! Here's a quick listing of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Femme Fatale DVD:

1. Good -  Britney's backup dancers were really good, especially the men. The choreography was good, not mind-blowing, but good. Oh yeah, the theatrics were pretty good too;

2. Bad - Britney herself, didn't bring the crisp, unbelievable dancing. She was dancing like she was dog-tired, and from what? Definitely not from singing and dancing simultaneously!

3. Ugly - Britney  lip synced approximately 90% of her songs.

I fell asleep TWICE, woke up and watched the songs that I missed. I'm glad I didn't shell out $$$ to see lip syncing in a live concert. I figure, if Madonna, who is like 52 years old and Beyonce and Shakira who are in the same age bracket as Britney can all sing and dance their mudda-shut-your-mouth tails off in their concerts then if Britney is lip syncing, her dance moves should in the least be slammin'.  After watching Femme Fatale one time, I thought it was uneventful, quite dull and thought to myself, hmm, I should have watched Lady Gaga first. Still, I favor Britney. She comes off during the concert as a very appreciative and nice person and also because I'm glad that she appears to have pulled herself together after the drama from a few years ago, I will watch Femme Fatal again - but probably after watching the Lady Gaga Monster Tour.",1322697600,4,2747,4.467065868263473
4892230,3,B005TQACLC,"The video quality is like seeing a dvd instead a blu-ray, I expected much more.
I think that Britney do the best she can at the moment, i've seen her live and it was almost lipsync ......this bluray sounds entire lipsynced.",1322697600,2,223,4.463414634146342
4892231,3,B005TQACLC,"I have some mixed feelings on this concert DVD. What I like, is the film quality. It's very high def, and it just looks pretty. Britney's body is also impressive. I haven't actually seen this concert in person, But as a die-hard, i've seen bits on youtube dozens of times. Her body looks much more fit in this particualar Femme Fatale showing than others.. I notice some very defined abs, and i've actually wondered if it's just airbrushing... and if it is, that's a dissapointment.

Everybody always says how this tour is apperently sung mostly live. If so, that's wonderful, but this DVD doesn't prove that at all. I was especially annoyed at how when she sang ""don't let me be the last to know"", it was just the track off of ""Oops I did it again"". Listen closely.. it's the EXACT SAME ONE. No live singing there. Really? All she was doing was sitting on a swing. I noticed that the very last line was sung live... But it sounded very weak.

Wasn't impressed with her Slave 4 u routine at all. Her backup dancers were making her look bad. Another thing that pisses me off, is there's nothing else on the DVD except for the concert. No behind the scenes, no interviews, nothing. That had me a little shocked.

I give this DVD a 7/10. It's okay, if you're die hard. it's nice to see her in action, if you can even call this action.. I miss her FLATTERING outfits. Those ankle-high boots she wore the entire time were hideous! Also the ""baby one more time"" performance was tacky and stupid.",1322438400,,1489,4.446886446886447
4892232,5,B005TQACLC,"Her show is amazing ! I was like: oh my god like: is it really britney ? like: damn gurl ! She's dancing not that much but it's very spectacular. She's not fat, she's not singing but her clothes are cool for a 90's prostitute. Her songs are always nice and they are a little bit remixed and pre-recorded so it's nice. I love the worldwide theme with new york, egyptian, asian... very sexy but in a nice way.
It's a nice live and it's cheap so buy it, you'll love it even if you're not a huge fan of her.",1322438400,,503,3.99009900990099
4892233,3,B005TQACLC,"I would have loved to have seen this concert in person; then I may have found the energy that was missing from the DVD.  As I watched the concert unfold, I was disappointed with the fact that the music sounds EXACTLY like the disc.  By saying this, I mean, that there is no ""live"" vocals on the DVD.  After reading more reviews, I find it's because they dubbed over her singing specifically for the DVD.  Very disappointing.
Don't get me wrong with the rest of the review, I have been a fan of Britney since she hit the scene but the woman has no grace.  You can chalk it up to bad knees and what not but she just clomps her way through the steps.  A lot of the time, she's upstaged by the talent of her dancers.  It's a given that she's not the same as she was ten years ago but she should exploit her strengths not try to keep the same ol', same ol'.  It seems forced.  Another review mentioned that it appears her heart isn't in it.  I would agree.  She's just going through the motions and speaking the scripted lines with little to no presence...though, she does look wonderful.
All in all, I'd rather listen to the CD than watch this DVD.",1322352000,,1144,4.225806451612903

I was also a little upset they didn't include Britney's performance of ""He About To Lose Me"" on the DVD. I think that is one of the best on the album.

4892236,1,B005TQACLC,"OK....so let me start by saying that I am a die hard Britney fan and have seen her 12 times live on various tours.  I did not get to see the Femme Fatale Tour so I was very excited to see the DVD.

The only positive thing I can say about this concert is that Nicki Minaj comes out and does her thing on ""Till the World Ends.""  Everything else about this concert dvd was terrible.  The filming was static and very cheap looking (I think there were about 3 cameras total)....and the editing was just awful (it looks like they spliced together some raw footage and called it a day).  It looks like they filmed a dress rehearsal of the show because the audience in silenced in the audio mix and Britney's live vocals (because she did sing live for a good portion of this tour) were dubbed over making it look like very sloppy lip syncing.

There is no backstage footage and nothing leading up to the concert besides a lame video.  This should go in the books for a guide on how to mess up a concert dvd.

I wish she would have released the Circus Tour instead.",1322265600,6,1056,4.218905472636816
4892237,5,B005TQACLC,"This DVD for the Femme Fatale tour by Britney Spears is a great idea for the fans and people whom were waiting a DVD since her last tour back in 2009 and is a great moment for having such a cool DVD cause the Album is amazing and the set list is quite well thinking and the tour set list even more.

She's definitely one of the best artist in the world and a great performer. If you like Britney, you will love this concert.

We all know how was the preparation for this but if you have any negative comment about the details, we all have too but we just step that aside and continue enjoying the show.",1322179200,,602,4.050420168067227

So basically, every song performance is same same and it makes me fall asleep. She is gorgeous and fit and I have so much respect for her but this is too painful to watch. And did I even mention some of the remixes are terrible.
I think Britney should have another choreographer and another Record Title, I mean whoever recorded and designed and released this DVD is so bad, the cover itself looks cheap and seems like they must have rushed to release it.",1322179200,3,727,4.473684210526316
4892239,4,B005TQACLC,"My musical taste generally leans towards indie-music, but I always appreciate great ""pop"" and Britney Spears' latest CD ""Femme Fatale"" has been one of the most unexpected surprises for me this year, a fantastic guilty pleasure if you want. I caught the ""Femme Fatale"" tour in Columbus here in Ohio this past August, and it was a fantastic show, period. The never-ending debate about whether Britney lip-syncs or not is totally besides the point, as far as I'm concerned, you go to the show to experience the totallity of it. So when I saw this DVD/CD deluxe edition at a big-box retailer the other day, I just had to pick it up.

""Britney Spears Live: the Femme Fatale Tour"" (DVD; 86 min.) brings her show from Toronto, and it was exactly the same set I saw in Columbus. The set list is heavy on ""Femme Fatale"", which is a great thing, as I happen to think it is Britney's best album, period. For me this DVD is simply a great memento of a fun show I saw a few months ago. But truth be told, I would not have bought this but for the enticing bonus CD that came with this.

The bonus CD (10 tracks; 56 min.) brings a great collection of remixes and one new track. There are three remixes of each ""Would You Hold It Against Me"", ""Till The World Ends"" and ""I Wanna Go"", and while you may think that is overkill, in fact those remixes are quite nice, never unrecognizable from the origial track, but done creatively in a way that I'm enjoying those songs in a new way. There is one new track, ""Scary"", which would've fitted very nicely onto the ""Femme Fatale"" album proper. In all, I am very pleased with this deluxe edition, which is available at a big-box retailer for just a few more dollars.",1322092800,,1691,4.382165605095541
4892240,2,B005TQACLC,"this would be something only a hardcore Britney fanatic would enjoy. i am not one but was curious to see how the show compared to other artist's recent shows... needless to say this show was quite boring. yes, i understand the whole thing is lipped with pre-recorded vocals but whoever mixed the audio did a really bad job. on my 5.1 surround system i had to turn the center channel up all the way to match the blaring left and right channels pumping out the studio tracks and background vocals. on certain songs u can hear her pre-recorded ""live"" vocals thru the center channel speaker, but faintly. i found that odd. the mixing also lacks bass to the subwoofer. i thought hey even if the show sucks i can hear the older revamped songs in great 5.1, another let down.
over all the concert was lacking the old energetic ""wow"" factor she used to deliver with her dancing and choreography. the video interludes were creepy and lame. lip syncing expected but the sound still isn't that good. and it shouldve included the entire concert.",1322092800,,1033,4.619565217391305

4892242,5,B005TQACLC,"Just watched the entire Blu-ray from start to finish. A-MA-ZING! Britney worked it! I saw The Femme Fatale Tour live twice and actually met Britney in Zagreb (flew all the way from Helsinki for that) and she was really sweet. You can tell that she really loves what she does. Back during the Onyx Hotel Tour you could tell by watching her performances that she was pretty much over it. Even though she was technically on point, delivering some of the best dance moves in the industry, looking at her eyes it felt like someone was forcing her to tour and she just wanted to stop. Not anymore. On this tour she looks so much more alive and in the moment. She's having fun with the crowd and the performances. She's full of energy and spirit. It felt like watching the Britney at the starting point of her career again.

The tour itself was very well directed. The costumes were great and the set list is packed with hits. I can't pick a favorite performance because they're all really essential. Sure there were some stand out moments but the show wouldn't work without those less elaborate moments either.

The video quality is top notch. I did see some weird jagged lines in some scenes but they didn't really bother me. The only complain I have about the video is that they did a poor job hiding the fact that they used footage from two nights on this release. Her hair looked different and the editing team didn't really seem to care at all. Also the lighting was different on these two nights. The first night's lighting was way too bright and it made her look pale and her hair looked like it was drenched in sweat. They seemed to have fixed the problem on the second night and she looked a lot more camera friendly. So seeing these two footage being switched around back and forth in one song was kinda annoying.

The audio quality is great, I really like that they didn't drown it with audience noises. Most of the concert was dubbed with album vocals which really pissed me off at first but I'm kinda getting used to it now. I found a little ""easter egg"" with the audio: during ""...Baby One More Time"" if you listen to the LPCM track you'll hear the album vocals but if you switch to the DD 5.1 track you'll hear the live (well, pre-recorded) vocals. I thought that was kinda neat seeing that we only got the dubbed vocals during the Epix broadcast.",1322006400,,2356,4.449074074074074

People can say what they will about Britney Spears, what they claim she is and what she isn't, but there is no doubt the woman is the poster girl for pop music, a transcending phenomenon for all generations. To keep it short and simple, I will say that the Femme Fatale Tour DVD is nothing short of spectacular. You don't have to be a fan per say, but if you are someone looking for an amazing display of talent and pop music perfection, this DVD is for you!

4892246,3,B005TQACLC,"I have always been a Britney fan but I have never felt compelled to see her in concert because of the major fact that she almost always lip sync all of her music for her live performances. There is no real talent in that but nevertheless I love her and her music and I buy her cds. I love great dance music and I love to dance myself. She does have some beautiful ballads as well. For those of us who are Madonna fans also, I believe that some, if not most of us may be disappointed with the Femme Fatale Tour. Britney rarely dances and her choreography for the entire show is from the waist up. I do not believe that the stage set up or the costumes did her any justice really. It is her dancers who have all the energy but they(the dancers) do not accent her the way Madonna's dancers do. Some of you might think it's unfair to compare the two but as a fan, I am spending my money on their music so I have that right. And for the record, I have been to a Madonna concert-The Sticky And Sweet Tour. What I do like about the Femme Tour is the new song arrangements but there was nothing spectacular or memorable about the performances for me. Some of the fans were having a great time dancing while others just simply looked on. I give Britney credit for lip syncing to her songs well. However, in her final number for DANCE UNTIL THE WORLD ENDS, her lip sync wasn't in unison with her record. I am content with my purchase(at Target) and I am most happy that a dance remix cd is also included. With the inclusion of the dance cd, I gave this review one more star making it 3 stars.  Personally, life could have turned out for the worse for Britney Spears after her public meltdown. It is great to see her happy again and enjoying life.",1321920000,2,1736,4.182089552238806
4892247,3,B005TQACLC,"Sadly instead of growing as an artist at least concert wise this went backwards. She isn't a train wreck but is nowhere near the performer/dancer she once was. I think she can be, but she has to find herself again too many ppl are controlling her. She looked uncomfortable performing some of the moves in ""if u seek amy."" Even the costumes felt a little cheesy; it's sad idk who's running the show but it's not going to last... Circus would've been a better DVD to put out.

Britney seriously needs to take a year to think about what she wants out of life and to get her crap together. Whether it's being with her family or being worthy of being a top entertainer she can do it she just needs to find a direction and get some standards. She owes it to herself and I'd hate to say it but she's going to lose fans if she doesn't raise the bar a little higher. I'll continue to be a fan, but it's sad to watch wasted potential.",1321920000,,924,4.191011235955056
4892248,3,B005TQACLC,"I saw the show back on June 28 in Portland, and I LOVED IT. However, this DVD is Britney's worst. Her dancers upstage her, and that's not right. I don't like the job Epix has done with the audio, visual, and whatnot. Britney Spears is BRITNEY SPEARS. Come on? You would expect more out of her... I bought this because I am a true fan and love all her work. You decide to buy it or not. A plus is the menu. It's basic, but it's nice. It plays the instumental to her hit I Wanna Go and shows small video clips throughout the show. I don't think you would be wrong to buy this but understand you get what you pay for and Epix sucks.

Dear Britney, next time you film one of your shows DO NOT let them dub your live vocals and stick to the pros [Shotime, HBO, and others. NEVER EPIX.]",1321833600,16,780,4.032258064516129

4892254,1,B005TQACLC,"I really believe in some ways Spears had a genius never before seen. I think her ""Live From Las Vegas"" DVD, which I reviewed here at Amazon, was simply the best show ever put on by a single female performer, and I've been going to the theater for over 50 years. Britney had a breakdown. She has not been able to get in touch with her creativity since. These meds thicken and slow you down, and confuse you into thinking all is OK, when it isn't. I saw her on stage in ""Circus."" I was afraid she was going to stop on stage and start to cry. The show was smoke and mirrors with no real dancing from Britney. This is the same thing: a sense that everything is moving s-o-o  s-l-o-w-l-y and without any enjoyment on her part.  I feel for the girl. I do. It takes tremendous guts to do what she's doing, but she's running out of time, and you can only play the ""Emporer's New Clothes"" routine for so long (as Empress). Soon there may be boos and jokes on late-night comedy shows. The hands-off-Britney halo she carries now could vanish, and what will her support system offer her then? Hebephrenia? It's no accident her mental-health professionals are lost:

Her psychiatrist appears to have been chosen by the same motivation(s) she used to choose the 48 hr. husband #1, who never failed to sell her out to the tabloids as much as possible after their 48 hr marriage. Husband #2, Kfed, performed as much mean-spiritted psychological homicide, theft and adultery on the poor girl as was possible, topping off his decapitation of her sanity by stealing her children. Then Sam Lufti and the paparozzo Ognog. Into the mix she chose this uninspired unpublished psychiatrist, who has never done anything with people suffering with delusional states except MEDICATE THEM! See reviews for Dr. Deborah Nadel, Santa Monica, CA. Britney needs someone who has come out of schizophrenia himself, and who can hold a light unto her path.

I, like Britney, entered schizophrenic processes in 1970, and have spent the last 40 years coming out of this disease. I have done so without meds and my videos on my website prove I can do the same with hers. My work using Britney's own Chaotic video to demonstrate her road-to-destruction is at my trailopen website.",1321401600,10,2238,4.643939393939394
4892255,3,B005TQACLC,I only give it 3 stars why did they cut off songs like Burning Up and He About To Lose Me I hate when they do this to concerts. not good at all,1321401600,2,143,3.3636363636363638

4892257,5,B005TQACLC,BEST POP TOUR EVER! BRINTEY SPEARS WITH HER UNQUE STAGE PRECENCE SHINE ON AN AMAZING STAGE WITH AN AMAZING PRODUCTION LIKE ONLY THE LEGENDARIES OF POP CAN DO!,1321315200,3,158,4.678571428571429
4892258,2,B005TQACLC,"I'm one of the rare people that is giving this a low score not because of bitter dislike for Britney, because I'm quite the opposite and have every disc and have seen many of her shows.  This rating is specifically for the production value of the DVD/Blu-Ray release of the Femme Fatale concert.  If you saw this concert in person, then you'd know that she actually sang a hefty portion of the show live, which is what fans have been asking for (especially after she lip synced the entire Circus concert).  However, on this DVD/Blu-Ray, when she does sing live, you can only faintly hear the actual vocals underneath pre-recorded tracks that were NOT heard at the actual concert (even the YouTube clips will prove this).  Why the producers of the disc would choose to cover her live vocals and continue to feed the ""Britney lip syncs because she can't sing"" myth is beyond me.",1321228800,46,876,4.632258064516129
4892259,5,B005TQACLC,"I'd like to start off by saying that I attended this concert back in June and felt that it was an incredible show. Most of the time I can't stand to watch full length concerts on tv because I'd rather be attending the actual concert. It took alot of self control to sit down and watch this, but after getting into it, it made me remember how much of a great time I had at the concert. So, all in all I enjoyed the filmed concert very much so.

Before I had the chance to view the concert via EpixHD.com, the only footage from the concert that I had seen was small snippets of certain songs. The only problem I had with the sneak peak footage was how the live/pre-recorded vocals that I had heard at the concert were dubbed over with the actual track. Thus making it look like, at certain times, that Britney is lip syncing very poorly. At first I thought I would have a problem with the film angles because there were only 3 different cameras. But everything turned out great! I enjoyed it immensely.

If you are a Britney fan, you will love this dvd. If not, then leave negative comments aside and walk away. The Britney that people watch and observe today is no where near the Britney that people fell in love with 10 years ago. Which is why there are devoted fans that have stood by her through thick and thin. Britney doesn't perform to please haters, she performers to please her fans and because she loves doing so. Yes she isn't the same performer she was when she first started. But if I had 2 knee injuries, 2 kids, and a highly publicized meltdown, I would have just given up. She is still going strong and that's why millions still love her, because she didn't quit and give up like so many would have done. It takes a strong person to comeback from what she went through, which is why fans love her.

Once again, If you are a Britney fan, I highly recommend this concert for you. It was such a great show and is really in the top two shows of her career. There is a little bit of the old and new in this concert.

ENJOY! :)",1321228800,48,2035,4.223650385604113
4892260,4,B005TQACLC,"I went to see Britney's FEMME FATALE tour at the M.E.N. Arena and enjoyed it for the most part and I'd recommend the DVD/Blu Ray release of the concert to Britney fans as most of the concert is live [the choruses of the dancier tracks and a few other parts are clearly prerecorded].

But... I'll be honest and say that if you don't like Britney, then you won't think the concert is really anything to shout about; Some parts are clearly using prerecorded vocals, it is a fairly short concert [this is because some of the songs Britney performs are shortened] and it isn't as 'showy' and bright as most other pop concerts.
Britney also does not connect with her audiences very well; there was a few rehearsed ""How you doing [insert name]?"", but I don't think that counts.

***

Anyway, on to the music...

Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is the highlight of the evening, as she does indeed perform it 100% live which shows that, yes, she CAN sing.
Trouble For Me and Till The World Ends are my favourite tracks on the Femme Fatale album and are great performed on stage, although some parts of these performances use prerecorded vocals.
Another must-see, for me, is when she performs If U Seek Amy. It's probably my favourite Britney single and her vocals are great on the live version. The classic single Toxic also has more zest to it when performed live and I love the oriental arrangements in this portion of the show.

Another standout is when Britney sings her verse from the Rihanna S&M remix. It's a shame that she only sings her verse; it is short and I was left wanting more.

***

I also love that the tour has one solid storyline holding it all together; There is a total of five segments for the tour, portraying a story in which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a stalker. The first section of the concert consequently features her escaping from prison along with other female inmates.
The second segment begins with a video intermission in which a stalker reveals that Spears is a secret agent. A video interlude in which the stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees the beginning of the third section, which features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics.
The fourth segment is preceded by another video interlude, featuring Spears changing clothes and choosing between different passports inside a hotel room. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.

***

I've gone to watch all of Britney's world tours and have to admit that I was saddened to see that the rag mags are semi-right for once; although it's not as obvious as it is in her Circus tour, Britney does look robotic a lot of the time and her dancing does look somewhat stiff.

I'm not having a dig at her herself, but maybe whoever is shoving her onstage should think twice, as she doesn't look comfortable and as if she's enjoying performing - she actually looked almost scared at times. For her Oops! I Did It Again and Onyx Hotel tours Britney has a mesmerizing stage presence and looked so happy to be there, and I would love her to feel like that again, but that hasn't happened yet.

Who cares if Britney lip-syncs? That's Britney. She has admitted for years that she lip-syncs to put on a better show, and most fans are fine with that - that's no reason to give the concert a bad review. This is a must-have for any Britney fan!

A complete waste of your money. Unless you want to watch an artist pretend to sing while dancing half-assed. Absolutely no talent. It should be 0 stars.",1320710400,9,401,4.47945205479452

4892267,5,B005TQACLC,"I went to 4 of her European shows and I was absolutely blown away. Every tour is more legendary, iconic and spectacular than ever. I couldn't imagine how she could possibly top ""The Circus Starring Britney Spears"", but as usual she exceeds even the highest expectations. This show is monumental, she performs many songs from her latest album (which was considered the avantgarde of pop by the most authoritative and prestigious critics in the world) and many classics get a completely new treatment. Her dancing is as usual well above the standards of music business and she clearly shows the technique and ability gained by someone who's been studying professional dancing seriously practically since she was born (along with singing, athletics and other disciplines). The vocals are 90% live and pitch-perfect, the rest of them relying on singing on top of a pre-recorded track. The sets, costumes and special effects are mesmerizing, plus this time you can definitely see she has fun and enjoys every minute of what she does on the stage. On many occasions she looks sweet and humble, while at the same time being sexy, fierce and in control throughout the show. It's definitely THE tour of the year and shows that the one and only queen of pop is Britney. Without having to put on ridiculous and trashy stuff that can attract only 10-year-old people and to fake exaggerated love for her fans, she still attracts millions of people through her music and passion and manages to genuinely express her love for her fans. She keeps on making music one step ahead of anybody else and topping the charts. She keeps on being a beacon for the industry even 13 years after she appeared on the scene and has gained the complete respect of the industry and of critics all over the world. And when she puts on a show, her music and her presence alone are enough to capture the audience. Nobody should miss such an epic event. I miss seeing her perform just inches from my nose. I can't wait for the Blu-ray to come so that I can relive the memories and enjoy the epicness of the event over and over again.",1320710400,8,2096,4.682926829268292
