6655096,5,B00NGQJK88,"This was such an inspirational story. No matter which side of the immigration reform battle, this will make you question your values. The advisor for the team was at our school, and he said rather than arguments after this movie, there was always a much more reasoned discussion afterwards. You will never be the same after watching this movie. OUTSTANDING!!!!!!",1426291200,5,362,5.05

6655100,5,B00NGQJK88,Great story that on the surface is about an underdog team of high schoolers. The profound lesson on the U.S. immigration situation is the true stunner. Great film,1421712000,6,162,4.821428571428571

6655103,4,B00NGQJK88,"It is inspiring and allow us to have great family conversation with my tween and teen. I first thought that it was a movie (I read from commonsense that it was inspiring and great for family).. but it turns out that it was more a documentary than movie. I later found out that there is a movie that was made on this true story, and it is called 'Spared Parts'. I actually prefer the documentary because we know these are real people, on real social issue (being 'undocumented' people) : on one hand, they beats all odds, as a Hispanic high-schoolers to beat MIT in robotic competition; on the other hand, it makes us ponder how much difficulties that they need to overcome in their career life. It is inspiring that they provided so much hope to the school, to the next generations of high-schoolers. We are just so proud of them, especially how they encounter difficulty in later lives of lesser opportunity and pursue on ! I am thankful of this documentary !",1463961600,2,960,4.522988505747127

6655114,5,B00NGQJK88,"It told a deeper story than just the one about winning the prize, taking it away from MIT.  This is a heartfelt documentary that presents a greater understanding of the plight of ""illegals""--or undocumented individuals whos ancestry came from South of the Border.  It moved me deeply.  Too many born in America Americans think everything should be done legally, but lives cannot always wait for legality.  I have no problem granting these young people financial aid in their own state if they have worked hard to make it to college.  I have no problem with giving aid to anyone who proves themselves.  Theses are not lazy people.  These are people who add richly to our nation.  We have many born-here types who should have their drive, ambition and desire to help themselves and this nation.  These are not the people we should be turning our backs on.  I loved this documentary.  I always root for the underdog when he is giving it his all in the fight!",1461715200,,955,4.658682634730539
6655115,5,B00NGQJK88,"This a great movie that makes me cried its a movie that will make you change the way of seem immigrants , I would strongly recommended to anyone",1461542400,,144,4.178571428571429
6655116,5,B00NGQJK88,Underwater Dreams is a documentary that at first seems to echo a fair number of stories - underdog kids overcome difficulties to win a competition against apparently superior competitors. This film is far more than that. U.D.tells a  more heroic struggle than you might expect. High school teams do not beat top tier universities. It does not happen and it is not supposed to happen. It happens here.,1461542400,,400,4.882352941176471
6655117,5,B00NGQJK88,"A truly inspiring documentary that gives voice to individuals who are not usually able to share their narratives to the masses. It reminded me that at the end of the day we are all people trying to all achieve similar goals - to love and to be loved, to care for those around us, and to live with a purpose. We, the people, can achieve greatness together as a community through getting over our fears.",1461369600,,401,4.36
6655118,5,B00NGQJK88,"I liked the way this film talked about what happen to all four students after the competition.  I had no idea how bad undocumented students have it in this life.  All they know is the US, but the US doesn't want to know them.  It's very sad.",1461283200,,241,4.085106382978723

6655120,5,B00NGQJK88,"This is an amazing story, it's hard to separate the film itself from the compelling true story it seems to tell.
As a documentary, it's a bit sloppy. The narrative is disjointed in a way that it forces the user to strain to follow along the winding path of these four amazing young people and their equally amazing teachers as they achieve an amazing accomplishment against seemingly impossible odds. The film focuses on details that aren't important and spends far too much time interviewing people tangentially involved in the boys' story.
The film shifts from the narrative of the robotics competition in the middle of the film and seems to shift into full propaganda mode detailing the bureaucratic and heavy handed struggles these young men faced even after proving their potential beyond any doubt.

As an experience, none of that matters.

If it wasn't a true story, any screenwriter who penned such an outlandish tale to expect an audience to believe a group of undocumented, impoverished, high school age kids from the harsh Arizona desert would defeat the world's top engineering school in, of all things, an underwater robotics competition would have been laughed out of Hollywood,at best, or , at worst, locked up in an insane asylum for even having such an absurd notion.

As a cast of characters we have something of a Marvel super hero team that seems like it was dreamed up by Stan Lee himself.  Oscar is the Leader -a soldier in the making, Christian is the quiet genius, Lorenzo the wise-cracking mullet sporting mechanically inclined bad-boy, and Luis is the towering soft spoken gentle giant. I struggle to think of a more likable, authentic, and humble group of young people ever portrayed in cinema.

ultimately they turn their disadvantages into advantage as their limited finances and experience means they have to find innovative solutions to solve problems, and ultimately isn't that what engineering is all about? Something the MIT team would do well to learn.

So we have our Hollywood ending, right? The high school boys from Arizona win the prize and beat out the season spoiled brats from MIT and go on to be rich and famous after attending MIT and inventing the next great thing, right?

That's where the politics come in, but it's not politics - it's their real life. Through no fault of their own these boys were brought to the states without documentation and regardless of how amazing and brilliant they are and how truly American they are. It was heartbreaking to see the struggle to achieve that doesn't nearly reach the level it should have. After watching this, it's hard to not be on their side.

The cover of the movie shows a kid whose not really even in the movie but for a second towards the end, because ultimately these amazing kids from  Arizona won't fully enjoy the victory because that victory belongs to future generations of young people who stand on their shoulders to achieve even more.",1461024000,2,2941,4.854291417165669
6655121,2,B00NGQJK88,It was okay. Needed editing down by half. Very repetitive. The inspirational story is dampened by the harsh reality undocumented immigrants face. And it was sad to see how the participants in the MIT robotics team all have fantastic careers while the kids who won the event are mostly just getting by.,1459209600,,301,4.8076923076923075

6655128,4,B00NGQJK88,"I am using the novel ""Spare Parts"" in a college ESL class and this documentary about the teens and their big win at the robotics contest is a welcome supplement to the novel.  The 6 main characters are introduced in the first 9 mins of the film so readers of the novel have a face to name. The juxtaposition of inner-city migrant kids' lives and the well-to-do white kids from MIT speaks volumes about class, race and economic divides.  The visuals in this documentary tell the story even more than the words, which makes great for second-language learners and young(er) kids (grade 5 and up).  Highly recommend for classroom use or family movie night.",1454976000,,652,4.701754385964913
6655129,4,B00NGQJK88,It was a very well done movie.  It talks about the importance of how well the team from the high school were prepared and how simple there design was and worked.,1454544000,,161,4.193548387096774
6655130,4,B00NGQJK88,Would be 5 stars but they had to make a political statement at the end. Had nothing to do with what the kids proved they could achieve.  Sad that it ended that way. Michael Pena should of made political based movie instead.,1454544000,,223,4.309523809523809

The answer is NO we cannot. Because the left politicizes every single thing that they can to advance their grubby agenda. Apparently the achievement of some very smart kids means we should throw our borders wide open to whoever feels like coming in.",1450742400,2,328,4.754385964912281

6655146,5,B00NGQJK88,"Loved the story of incredible achievement of these Latino kids. Interesting to note only the women went on to college, the young men did not go on. Heck, MIT would have taken them on scholarship had they applied. What happened there?

As important, the reality of the US's insane laws to do with immigration. What I don't understand, is WHY anyone in the US, especially in states like Arizona, would call Mexican folks ""alien"". Check out the map. Not all that long ago, Arizona once was, along with the west side of the USA (you guessed it)... Mexico.

Hey, the conquerors had bigger guns and we lost. But we're not aliens. My name is LOPEZ.",1445990400,3,641,4.565217391304348

6655205,5,B00NGQJK88,"What a wonderful documentary about four undocumented high school students who entered a national underwater robotic contest on a whim in the college division--and won.  This documentary shows the actual contest, and the aftermath, and interviews the students, judges, the MIT students who lost and came in second place.  A very inspiring movie.  This shows how that contest changed the lives of the students, their school and the community.",1433289600,3,440,5.3478260869565215

6655207,5,B00NGQJK88,"Good watch.  I wish it was included on Prime. (Now it is available free on Prime.)  The first part is encouraging as the High School students are not ""sophisticated"" enough to do anything but their BEST rather than just trying to get by.  They beat out all the other teams across the board! They even got a special ""Judges Prize"".  Then they got ambushed by their political reality after they graduated from high school.  Then it gets depressing.  They meet up with the MIT team they beat 10 years later.  The MIT students have great jobs but are clueless to understand that ""trying to start a business"" is sometimes a way of saying ""I am unemployed with few prospects"".  They students did not give up hope, they just have not been able to go where they should have been able to. We cannot afford to waste people like this.

Can we afford to waste these kinds of people? (NO!)",1431648000,3,876,4.459119496855346

8678080,2,B00NGQJK88,"Major let down after purchasing Spare Parts and then watching this - it was obvious that Spare Parts hype it up and it felt really good in that movie. MIT look like such undefeatable component - but I know this movie was closer to real life and unfortunately was feel with politics which just gave it nasty taste.

My hope was just after watching Spare Parts,  I wanted to help others even with robotics and I have actually done this - but this in ways hurts that desired.  It just means that real life is not always as sweet as it in movies.

Don't give me wrong - there is nothing in wrong in helping other achieve there dreams,  but the way this movie put politics into is not the way - there must be a better way to handle situations like this.  I almost wanted to give one star but could not because the goal of this teacher helping these students.",1488844800,2,853,4.234567901234568
