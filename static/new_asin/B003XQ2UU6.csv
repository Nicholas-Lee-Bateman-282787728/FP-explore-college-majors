8408474,2,B003XQ2UU6,I misunderstood/ miss read. I already have Fantastic Four and all the X-Men DVDs. I thought Fantastic 4 and X-Men were in a movie together.,1352073600,,139,4.6
8408475,4,B003XQ2UU6,These are movies for someone who loves films based on comic books and the special effects are good. Fantastic 4 has less of a plot than X-Men does. The Characters and their conflict with one another not to mention the full throttle grab you by your heels intensity of the film is a little to somewhat less when in comparison to X-Men.  Fantastic 4 is a decent film but X-Men is an EXCELLENT one. The background on all of the characters is not always clear in X-Men.  The background on the characters in Fantastic 4 is fairly boring.  I am a person who likes to in general have a very good grasp of what is happening in a movie from beginning to end. I need a engaging plot and interesting characters. X-Men has all of these things while Fantastic 4 only has them to a lesser degree.,1225152000,2,782,4.3061224489795915
