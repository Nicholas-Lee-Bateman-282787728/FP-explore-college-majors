4483026,3,B004VLYHTE,"The Royal Jewels provides a survey of the more modern jewels belonging to the British Royals. The jewels are beautifully filmed. Some of the history of the jewels is included. Among others, jewels that passed from the Russian Crown Jewels into the hands of Queen Mary are discussed in detail, as well as many gems that originated from the South African diamond mines.

However, I gave the show only 3 stars, because one of the oldest and most interesting jewels, the Black Prince's Ruby, is only mentioned briefly and none of its amazing history is told in this presentation. The Black Prince's Ruby is the large red stone at the center of the cross on the crown (the Imperial State Crown), pictured on the cover of the DVD.

The Black Prince's ruby, which is actually a spinel(all red stones used to be referred to as rubies) is the large (170 c.) uncut red stone set in the Imperial State Crown. The Sovereign traditionally wears the Imperial State Crown at the end of the Coronation Ceremony and for the State Opening of Parliament.

The red gem came onto the stage of history as the possession of the 14th Century Prince of Granada, ruler of Moorish Spain. Later Don Pedro of Castile stabbed the captive Prince of Granada to death and claimed the large stone from his corpse, during the Reconquest. In 1366, Don Pedro's illegitimate brother, Henry of Trastamara, revolted against him. Pedro fled Spain taking refuge with Edward the Black Prince of England. Edward restored Don Pedro to his throne in return for the chicken egg sized red stone. During the war to restore Don Pedro, Edward the Black Prince became disgusted with Don Pedro's cruelty and oath breaking. Once Edward returned to England, Don Pedro was soon deposed and killed, in 1369, by his bastard brother.

During his campaign in France, King Henry Vth of England, wore the large red gem on a jewel encrusted crown atop his helmet. He almost lost it, and his life, at the battle of Agincourt, in 1415, when the French Duke of Alencon struck King Henry V with a battle ax, cleaving away a portion of Henry's crown. Henry survived and won the day. The stone is also reported to have been worn by Richard III, when he died at Bosworth Field and a victorious Henry VII ascended the English throne.

James I had the stone set in the state crown for his coronation, in 1603. Cromwell had the royal regalia melted down or sold, during the Commonwealth period. The Black Prince's Ruby was sold to an English jeweler. It was purchased by the crown for the restoration regalia of King Charles II, in 1660. The State Imperial Crown was remade for several coronations, including Victoria's and George VI's, but always included the historic Black Prince's Ruby.

Two other historic gems, set in the Imperial State Crown, are also passed over. The history of the large oval blue stone (the Stuart Sapphire)set in the bottom back of the Imperial State Crown is ignored, as well as the blue gem at the center of the cross set atop the crown (St Edward's Sapphire).

All in all, there are a number of interesting photographs and film clips included in this show and a great deal of 20th Century history connected with the Royal Jewels. However, I found the presentation more slanted toward Royal watchers than to an actual and complete history of these jewels. I am left wondering why the makers of the documentary chose to ignore the Black Prince's Ruby.",1345420800,15,3407,4.706375838926174

I am very disapointed.",1337644800,3,97,3.6666666666666665
4483028,5,B004VLYHTE,Absolutely fascinating.  Interesting to see how the jewels are modified throughout time to suit both the era and person wearing them.  The most beautiful collection of gems that you can think of.  Can't wait to view the other DVD's of the European and Swedish Jewels.,1333238400,3,267,4.888888888888889
4483029,5,B004VLYHTE,I love the royal family and this Doc is amazing and gives you a real in depth look at the public and private collection of the royal family. even if your not a fan of the Royals and just a fan of Jewelery this is one DVD you have to see!,1327536000,,237,3.6666666666666665
4483030,5,B004VLYHTE,"This was purchased for our daughter, she loved it and thought it was
very informative.  The Royals are her hobby, and she knows a lot
about the subject, so she would be a good judge this was a good
product.",1315872000,21,206,4.15
4483031,4,B004VLYHTE,"wanting to know more about the royal jewel collection, i purchased this dvd. what a wonderful (albeit short at 50 minutes) piece!

historically informative, visually stunning, and well presented, i am entirely pleased with this purchase.

not only can these beautiful pieces be seen up close, but the accompanying historical footage of various members of the royal family is tip top. it was also interesting to see how the jewels changed settings and hands over the years.

for anyone interested in the royal family and/or jewelery in general, this dvd is well worth the price.",1314316800,26,577,5.052631578947368
4483032,5,B004VLYHTE,Wonderful DVD and a must for all who are into jewelry.  A great insight as to fabulous gems and owners.,1313366400,5,103,4.15
4483033,4,B004VLYHTE,"Even though I was familiar with many of the history of the gems and crowns it was worth seeing them in HD up close.  The sharpness of the pieces is stunning. Its almost like seeing them up close and in person.

For those not familiar with the stories or history of the Monarchy this is an informative and light account of the jewels and their origins.

I loved the historical footage Of Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary as well as learning about the jewelry gifted to Diana for her wedding.

This was well worth the price.",1312934400,37,520,4.385416666666667

4483040,5,B004VLYHTE,With as many jewels as HM owns this boils have been a much better documentary and lasted much longer,1407196800,,100,4.315789473684211
4483041,3,B004VLYHTE,"Like some of the other viewers, I was rather let down by this documentary. I have visited the crown jewels twice and I can tell you, visitors must be kept moving at all times.  You are in and out of there VERY fast.  So, I would have liked more accurate footage of what I had to race past on my visits. Some is okay and some is outright fakery.

However, the reason I gave it an ""okay"" rating is that I did enjoy all of the background and history of the pieces shown, even though there were some big error in there too.  I also liked some of the insights offered by the talking heads in this documentary, especially the one discussing how she was initially so surprised that QEII had not bestowed more of the pieces onto her daughters-in-law, as had previously been royal custom.  To be honest, I had never thought about that.

Nevertheless, this documentary is disappointing, but it will have to suffice until a REAL documentary about the jewels is made.",1405123200,,955,4.428571428571429
4483042,4,B004VLYHTE,I was really impressed by the clever way the jewels were used.  I never knew any of this.  It was informative and enjoyable,1396224000,,123,4.304347826086956
4483043,5,B004VLYHTE,"An extremely interesting account of these prized possessions and artistic masterpieces from centuries of the royals.  To be sure, each piece is a national treasure, and though questions arise of the need for these jewels to be kept by just a privileged few, this is still an opportunity to view and appreciate this beautiful art form.",1392076800,,334,4.964285714285714
4483044,5,B004VLYHTE,The condition of the cover and book was perfect. This is a great book and any Royal Family buff will enjoy the book.,1389398400,,116,4.086956521739131
4483045,5,B004VLYHTE,I never get tired of seeing the Royal jewels. I have many royal books and this is the first DVD. Thought the colors would be great to see and they are. Worth buying for those who love the British Royals!,1388188800,,203,4.1
4483046,5,B004VLYHTE,I wanted a memento of our trip to London and more depth about the jewels.  This DVD delves into the history of the items and is worth seeing if you are interested in royalty.,1378166400,,174,4.117647058823529
4483047,4,B004VLYHTE,Nicely presented narrative with good visual reviews of the pieces. As an amateur who enjoys seeing precious stones this was a lovely video!,1369785600,,139,5.086956521739131
4483048,5,B004VLYHTE,The DVD shows the Crown Jewelswhich I was lucky to see in person a few yars ago with my mom and 3 of my friends while we were in London.  they are simply gorgeous.  I also like knowing about the history of the other jewelry items on the DVD.  Some of the items I had seen in a book that I have about the Queen's jewelry collection.,1365379200,,331,3.91044776119403
4483049,5,B004VLYHTE,"If you are interested in the royal jewels, this is a great DVD.  The jewelry is not just jewelry; all the pieces have a history which is what makes them what they are.",1365206400,,167,4.0606060606060606
4483050,3,B004VLYHTE,I gave the video 3 stars only because of the photos and clips. I was very disappointed to find mistakes. A glaring one being the misidentification of the Duchess of Teck. It is a shame that careful research was not done. I was also put off by the lack of objectivity concerning Queen Mary.,1359936000,6,289,4.37037037037037
4483051,5,B004VLYHTE,"This documentary of the history of the royal jewels was very interesting, and more fun to watch than a book might be to read.",1356220800,,125,4.25
4483052,3,B004VLYHTE,"Very beautiful review of the gems and the people who have worn them.  I would have liked to have seen more of the jewels that  exist from historical royals such as Elizabeth I or Henry VIIII, ect.  A history of the gems origin would have enhanced the presentation.",1356048000,2,264,4.458333333333333
4483053,2,B004VLYHTE,"I ordered 'The Royal Jewels' DVD through Amazon.com along with a number of other royal-related books recently and eagerly awaited its delivery.  Upon arrival I immediately noted that the DVD cover bore a photographic image of The Imperial State Crown - not the actual crown itself but a facsimile.  Much to my disappointment, it appeared to me that all of the jewels shown (up close, in detail) were 'fakes' - some I would even describe as horribly cheap respresentations of their historic originals.  It seemed to me that the only 'real' examples where those that once belonged to the late Duchess of Windsor and those, for the most part, all bore tags presumably placed there by the auction house contracted to sell the jewels in the late 1980's.

I CANNOT RECOMMEND this DVD to anyone genuinely interested in 'the royal jewels'.  Importantly, the DVD does not clearly separate the Crown Jewels from the private collection of jewels owned by HM The Queen and by other members of the royal family. This is an important distinction which should have been noted.  There were also a number of significant errors made through out such as refering to Queen Mary's mother as ""The Duchess of Cambridge"" when, in fact, she was upon marriage The Duchess of Teck.  (Note: prior to her marriage she was known as HRH Princess Mary of Cambridge, daughter of TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.) There were also many examples when a particular piece of jewelry (such as the ""Albert Brooch"") was being described but the footage shown was of the Queen wearing something similar (but not the same!)  The same can be said about the description of how the late Princess of Wales altered some pieces of the sapphire and diamond jewelry that she received from the Saudi Royal family for her wedding in 1981. All examples of very poor research and an obvious overall ignorance of the subject matter, in my opinion.",1345852800,17,1896,4.794478527607362
