8153383,5,B000JU8HB0,"Jeff (Frankie Darro) and Frankie (Mantan Moreland) team up in this tale of murder with just the right amount of comedy and hilarious shenanigans! They witness a murder at the Carlton Arms Hotel,where they work overtime to avoid being caught goofing off on the job, and set out to solve this crime before they become the next to be eliminated. This is delightful entertainment that kept people talking long after they left the theater and so will you after you see ""You're Out of Luck""! Thumbs up from me! Don't miss it!",1337731200,7,519,4.6521739130434785
