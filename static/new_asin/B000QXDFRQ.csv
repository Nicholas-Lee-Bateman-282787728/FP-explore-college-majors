2849354,3,B000QXDFRQ,"This was *way* less interesting than some of Bunuel's other work.  His ""Phantom of Liberty"" is brilliant, for instance.  He's obsessed, in this film, with some of the nuances of Catholicism.  Your enjoyment of this film will be roughly in proportion to your leve of interest in religious philosophy.  If you're not interested in religious philosophy, take a pass.",1193443200,4,363,5.101694915254237

2849356,5,B000QXDFRQ,"The Milky Way (1969)
Dir. Maestro Luis Bunuel
One of best movies that analyzes European Christianity and Catholicism with a Surrealistic microscope. Two allegorical pilgrims on there way to Santiago de Compostela from Paris see 2000 years of Orthodoxy through a series of unrelated vignettes dealing with heresies and anathemia. Blasphemy? Hardly. Sacreligous? Never!
Critical in a loving way? Of course. Get this movie. Pierre Clementi rules as the Destroying Angel!
Extras are minimal with  1 short documentry and 2 interviews, one with a critic who sounds like he didn't get it in the first place.
However, this Criterion DVD is packaged with the class that The Milky Way deserves. Subtitles default in English with overlapping text. Original language: French with a touch of Spanish and Mystical Latin. I see this movie as the natural sequel to Simon of the Desert.
Luis Bunuel, filmmaker, Surrealist Extraordinaire, we'll never see his kind again. Nope. Thank God for him!
Coincidence or not, you decide: the timing for the release of this movie and the Mother Theresa journal?!!!!!",1188259200,17,1087,5.211428571428572
8197957,4,B000QXDFRQ,"This has as much in common with Monty Pythons Life of Brian as any other film I can think of.  Both successfully make fun of religious orthodoxy by having random characters intensely (and absurdly) debate the very, very fine points of what exactly is heresy.  The difference is, thats just one element of Life of Brian, but Bunuel has in essence made a whole film of it.  Whether its a waiter, or Jesus himself, everyone weighs in on which interpretation of catholic teachings are correct in a series of sketch-like scenes.

Whats interesting is that Bunel, an avowed atheist, has really done his homework, and almost all the arguments either quote directly from the Bible, or from various Catholic scholars, thinkers, and heretics.

The story loosely follows 2 pilgrims on their way to Santiago in Spain to see the relics of the apostle James.  On the way they encounter an ever wider net of people, all of whom have passionate beliefs in their particular brand of dogma, to the point of being willing to kill for it.  (The two pilgrims are very tramp-like, and put me in mind of Waiting for Godot  I wouldnt be surprised if Bunuel made that connection intentional.)

In the end, the film is an effective comic outcry against obsession with any dogma; religious, political, etc, and the fact that people are willing to kill those who violate their own strict interpretation of 'the rules'.  The film is funny, but more often in a way that made me smile, not laugh out loud.

The repetition of the basic joke did wear thin for me after a while.  But this is still heady, very, very smart, and a lovely combination of absurd humor and humanist sentiment.  It also manages to be surprisingly open ended about Christianity, seeing the sweet side as well as the absurd, and occasionally presenting miracles as real (or as real as anything in this absurd world), making it clear that Bunuel's anger is far more at those who would destroy faith by being literal and compulsive, than at the idea of faith itself.

It's sad that this smart, rueful film - while not Bunuel's very best - has gone out of print and is ridiculously expensive at the moment.",1462060800,,2144,4.667553191489362
8197958,5,B000QXDFRQ,"Very good indeed, but I never received the booklet. That was a BIG disappointment especially since it was rather expensive!",1444694400,,123,5.2
8197959,5,B000QXDFRQ,"This is perhaps the best of Bunuel.  First saw this in college in the 70s.  Ended up taking friends back again and again until I had seen it 4-5 times.  Then became basically unavailable for many years, but with the Internet finally got my hands on a VHS at a good price.  Promptly watched it once again and was pleasantly surprised that it was just about as good as I had remembered.  Never played it again for fear my old VHS machine would eat it, as it was prone to do in those years.  Alas no more old VHS, but was recently looking for a new machine to make a digital copy. This DVD version should be even better than the VHS.  But at more than $90 a pop from Amazon?  Probably would pay that if I did not have the VHS in my safe still.",1423699200,,740,4.02054794520548
8197960,4,B000QXDFRQ,"""The Milky Way"" was directed by an atheist, but I (as a Universalist Christian) found the film opened the door to an intelligent debate on the nature of Christ.  If individuals are exceptionally close-minded about their faith, ""The Milky Way"" will be an affront.  However, if you are strong in your convictions and can tolerate an argument against (or perhaps for) them, this film may prove enlightening.  As a warning, there are some bizarre surreal elements that can frustrate with their absurdity.  (For example, a priest that is barred from entering a bedroom is show inside the room even though he never physically enters.)
  Overall, ""The Milky Way"" is very intelligent and philosophical cinema and wholly worth your time.",1401753600,,728,5.07563025210084
8197961,5,B000QXDFRQ,"A friend and I saw a documentary about the Way of St. James, which revived my interest in ""the Milky Way,"" Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's film about 2 travelers on the route; I'd seen it when it was new, 40 years ago, and loved it immediately (not a universal reaction). Its slight plot is really a springboard for explorations of faith, dogma and heresy -- expressed in the context of Catholicism but powerful even for this unbeliever. It's also funny as hell. Or as heaven, depending on who you believe...",1400371200,,497,4.659090909090909
8197962,4,B000QXDFRQ,"The final entry in Luis Buuel's unofficial ""French trilogy"" finds a pair of vagabonds seeking a ride, hop, or skip to a holy site in Spain. But the story isn't about them and their journey so much as it is a narrative of the Catholic Church's blasphemies and contradictions. Buuel masterfully weaves the film from one scene or character to another naturally, even when both are unrelated. For example, in one scene, a restuarant server is speaking with the cooking staff about the duality of Christ. The vagabonds appear and he kicks them out. The camera follows the server as he greets a pair of patrons and continues the conversation about Christ with them, right where he left off. Many non-sequitors and surreal pieces are stitched in such a manner quite smoothly. This is the weakest of the the three films in the French trilogy (the others being ""Le fantme de la libert"" and ""Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie""), but that does in no way mean that it is a weak film in and of itself.",1306454400,2,990,4.598870056497175
8197963,5,B000QXDFRQ,"This is a masterpiece of Bunuel's stream of consciousness surrealism at a late stage in his career.  Only could an ex-catholic (of the fervent variety) have produced such a memorable and hilarious parade of images, including the hypocrisy of the faithful, a novel view of Christ as a great spontaneous orator, and the extremes of behaviors - martyrdoms, self-mutilations, you name it! - of Christians.

The plot, if there is one, follows 2 tramps as they travel towards Spain, in a long debate on religion while panhandling, visiting prostitutes, or wondering about the meaning of it all.  There are miracles just missed, spliced with images from history, and Bunuel's speculations.  In one scene, a restauranteur is expounding how ""God is in everything like liver is in this pate"" and extolling Christian generosity only to turn the bums away in the rudest manner.  There are so many scenes like that that stick in the memory and get the viewer to question, all the time conscious of the mystery that is life.  It is profound, funny, and open to interpretation.

Recommended as a masterpiece of experimentation and intelligence by one of the greatest directors of the 20C.",1306108800,3,1173,4.984615384615385
8197964,5,B000QXDFRQ,"If for no other reason, this film is relevant for making you understand why beards are important.
If it doesn't happen right away, it eventually becomes clear that Luis Buuel is master of cinema. Buuel's style of filmmaking (specifically in this film) is very transparent in that you cannot recognize his authorship simply from the visual, it is more a matter of diegetic content. True transcendence and a degree of experimentation is achieved along the lines of narrative and the ideas that create this narrative. Style is kept to a minimum. With Buuel, this is a good thing.
  The milky way develops as the two main characters travel back and forth through time in a ""linear"" pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Yes, that sentence is supposed to sound that way. As stated before, Buuel's uniqueness in this film is due to an experiment with narrative, not so much with cinema as a medium. Buuel allows us to think in perhaps the more traditional terms of experiment with storytelling.

  The milky way is a film that clearly expounds Buuel's fine sense of humor. Buuel has a humor that is truly unique, consequently yielding utterly unique works of cinema. It is a humor that is truly humanistic, irreverent as though it may be.
  One particular scene that I truly enjoyed was when the two pilgrims are at a truly horrific/comedic presentation at an all girls school, where the young students mechanically recite reasons for ex-communion from the church to the very enthusiastic parents that sit around and listen. In a contiguous scene we see a band of revolutionaries executing the pope (played by Buuel for further irony). When the gunshot is heard by the parents attending the meeting back at the school one of them asks bemused: ""What was that?"" one of the pilgrims replies ""Oh... I was just imagining the pope being shot"".
  There are plenty of other examples of such exquisite comicality so particular to the mind of Buuel (I might have slightly distorted the last scene in my retelling of it -it has been a while since I have seen the film).

The milky way is incredibly witty, exploring the absurd that makes us human. Buuel's atheism is not to be misunderstood.
It is the atheism that comes hand in hand with reason for sure, but at the same time there is an understanding for the cultural value
of religion. It is clear that there has been great proximity to catholicism during his upbringing. And when you grow up surrounded
by ideas and images as those of most religions, and confront these to reason, you have no choice but to become a surrealist, after having
evidenced people choosing or made to believe in the absurd. At least it is something along these lines that we could get from Buuel. Or so much more, or something completely different. He would have been amused.
It is a work of subtle cinema, yet the ideas set forth and played with in this film remain with you. Pacing is slow, but in a good way (just in case you were wondering).",1252195200,3,2960,4.696911196911197
8197965,4,B000QXDFRQ,"In watching Bunuel, one has to accept the inevitable disconnectedness of surrealism. By providing us with the 'spine' of the two travelers' pilgrimage, the movie has continuity while still allowing the director a free hand for his precociousness. The result is a lot of separate stories, ideas, delightful silliness, and surprises that keep the viewer involved and challenged, but not confused. This is one of the better Bunuel films in my opinion. In addition, the print and color were exceptional, except in a few washed out clips. Finally, the extras were adequate, which is more than I can say for most of the Bunuel offerings I've purchased.",1196553600,3,646,5.046728971962617
8197966,4,B000QXDFRQ,"despite the weight of the subject at hand, and the disorientation from the rapid montage from one time period to the next, this may be the least surreal of all the French era Bunuels.  Within a mix of what for Bunuel seems relatively light provocation, he presents a series of historical religious events that amplify his critique of the Church for it's losing its way through its obsession with infallible detail that contradicts itself as it evolves.  i confess that as a fan of the parable of the good samaritan, i  share a sense of befuddlement at the intolerance and exclusivity of the fundamentalists of any religion, let alone one founded on love and tolerance.

but what makes Bunuel's argument so interesting is his avowed atheist stance.  from his earliest movies on, he has ridiculed the folly of authoritarian ascension, seemingly maintaining full grasp of the beauty of the original that lies beneath the facade.  he opens the door for the viewer, while demonstratively refusing to take the step through for himself.  one can only wonder what motivations lay at the heart of an artist whose gifts produce such clarity.",1193875200,17,1131,4.921052631578948
