846117,5,6304326319,"A well-to-do- Indian family is paid a visit by the supposedly long-lost uncle of the wife.  His passport reads ""M. Mitra."" But is he a relative?  Her husband doubts whether Mitra is really her uncle.  She doubts it also, but is frightful of being unhospitable to her own uncle.  They agonize over what to do-- how to treat this man, when he may be a dear relative, away from the family for 35 years, and he may be a fraud.
It's been done many times in many movies; the stranger comes into a family and disrupts the quiet domestic life with his foreign ways, his ""differentness,"" but in this potent drama, director Ray injects the question of identity.  Is M. Mitra who he says he is?  And even if he is, what are his motives? The plot of Agantuk is very simple, but the movie asks the viewer to reconsider how he sees strangers in his society.  The setting and characters are of India, but the themes of the movie are universal.
Utpal Dutt is wonderful as M. Mitra, the stranger.
Robi Ghosh is also sensational-- knee-slappingly funny as a family friend who begs to visit so he can slyly question M. Mitra, to determine his authenticity.
Mamata Shankar plays the role of the mother/wife with understated grace, until late in the movie.  Then she brings the movie a great deal of heart, in a scene where she openly grieves about the way her family has treated M. Mitra.  The scene is touching without being mawkish.
If you love great cinema and gripping drama, rent or buy Agantuk (The Stranger).  It goes for your heart and your brain.

846118,5,6304326319,"This last work of Satyajit Ray shows a prolific genius never tires of producing masterpieces. Like a typical Ray film, the narration proceeds in more than one dimension and one needs to see the movie more than once to realise that (although in this aspect he had reached his best in his earliest works). Every viewing brings out something new in the character, story, and their progression, something so subtle that you feel you hade missed it when you saw it before. It's very difficult to say about the story, for there is very little to be told, yet so much to be realised and felt when one sees it. One dialogue in tha last scene, when the child's father (I forget his name) asks the uncle whether it's customary among the uncivilised tribe to hug a person goodbye, says it all. This movie is the statement of a person's realisation about the human civilisation, it's contradictions and fallacy, and yet coming to terms with it in the end. Simply, a very poignant and beautiful film, about humanity.",991008000,4,1003,4.640449438202247

7868236,5,6304326319,"As reviewers of the DVD and video cassette versions before me have mentioned, Ray proceeds here to challenge values of our modern lives, but there's one bedrock value he leaves untouched: the role of women. We see in Agantuk an ""ideal"" Bengali family, which is called  into question. What's never taken on though is the idealized Indian wife. Our leading lady's quiet and gracious. Since she's privileged, she can sing classical music well. She's beautiful as she soundlessly traverses the set. But she's confined in her role as surely as is her husband and his associates. She serves the males at the table, waiting demurely to eat once they've had their fill. No ""modern woman"" she, as her guest observes. Her husband flings himself in distress across his bed; she can only cock her head to one side and furrow her pretty brow.

This was 1991. Such a depiction of a woman would never fly today, at least not in Satyajit Ray's setting of enlightment.

Otherwise, the film effectively shines a light on what we hold dear--an act on--in our modern lives. Alas, only his perfect woman isn't put to test.",1332720000,,1101,4.7539267015706805
7868237,5,6304326319,"I own all of Mr Bongo's Ray releases and all are very good quality. You should keep in mind, however, that most of Ray's films have been very poorly kept and so finding good prints is extremely difficult. Also, even original prints were not in the best condition when the films were released due to budget issues. But still, I have compared the Mr Bongo releases with Indian releases and I can tell you that Mr Bongo's are many, many time better - and about as good as your likly to ever find.",1274832000,5,493,4.311827956989247
7868238,5,6304326319,"Anila (Mamata Shankar) and Sudhindra Bose (Deepankar De) welcome the unexpected arrival of Anila's long lost uncle, Manmohan Mitra (Utpal Dutt) with great hesitation.  For the first time in nearly three decades, he shows up, out of the blue, and the first thought that runs across the couple's mind is that this man is attempting something [...] and dishonest with them.  As the story progresses and Mr. Mitra reveals more and more stories from his past, quite openly, the more their suspicion dissapates.

Filmmaker Satyajit Ray was always a marvelous storyteller, and this film doesn't pale in comparison to his other films.  It is entertaining and engaging.......",1178323200,,666,5.196261682242991
7868239,5,6304326319,"From the earliest films, The Apu Trilogy (1959) to his latest The Stranger (Agantuk), from India, filmmaker Satyajit Ray has garnered numerous awards and is recognized as one of the greatest directors.  With his work, he wore many hats, including that of a writer and a graphic artist.

Ray was born in 1921 and died in 1992 and made 40 films and documentaries.  If you enjoy foreign film, see at least one of Satyajit Ray's films.  Especially this one!  Characters are good, dialogue is excellent.

Filmed in 1991, most of the setting takes place in the house, there is no soundtrack, it is 120 minutes and in color.  Don't watch while sleepy, there is great challenging dialogue you won't want to miss.

Anali Bose, her husband, Sudhindra Bose, and their young son live well with servants in India.  Anali receives a letter that an uncle, Manomohan Mitra, is coming to visit and she saw him when she was only 2 years old.  Anali's husband believes him to be an imposter.

Anali follows tradition to treat a guest with respect, but her husband's suspicions lay heavy on her mind.  Meanwhile, the uncle, Mitra, learns the doubt the family has.  Mitra is a world traveler, fluent in many languages, a learned man, and has a keen philosophical sense of life.

The husband, Sudhindra, at two different times, invites ""qualified""  friends over to challenge and grill Mitra to find the truth.

""Come Clean or Clear Out""
Those are the exact English words said by one frustrated interrogators during one of the grillings that the uncle is subjected to.  The grilling sessions are quite amusing and informative.

English language widely used.
What has struck me about this film were the many uses of the English language and phrases intermingled and spoken by all.  It is puzzling.

Highly recommend Ray's

7868240,5,6304326319,"This remarkable film is in many ways a self portrait of Satyajit Ray because he was none other than an anthropologist and philosopher in the true sense of playful, childlike wonder.
This is the the story of how how a life of curiousity and wonder have to survive in this cruel and foolish world which judges everything in materialistic terms.
The philosopher is always and everywhere a stranger,though full of joy, simplicity and wonder at Being which is fervently demonstrated in the 'cosmic magician' sequence. Only those with the child in them alive will understand!",1087689600,4,569,5.0
7868241,5,6304326319,"This film is rather important, even today. It is about the chase for a Nazi war criminal who has managed to erase his tracks and has emigrated to the US where he managed to integrate the good society of a small town. He was responsible for the final solution in one important concentration camp. The first idea that comes clearly from the film is that a criminal of that type can never reform and is a perverted mind and man forever. He has to be caught and neutralized. He has to be brought to court to answer for his crimes. The film is quite well done and the suspense is rather well built. The end is spectacular and very demonstrative of what such a criminal can come to if he feels menaced. Even love cannot erase his crimes and cannot make him come to terms with his responsibility because he has no conscience any more. To be shown to young audiences for them to see what war and fascism can lead to.

7868243,5,6304326319,"Satyajit Ray's last bow. And no doubt one of his finest. The movie, like most of Satyajit Ray's classics, operates on many levels. On one level, it is an endearing story of a long lost uncle who comes back after many years and throws a typical middle class household into disarray. Is he for real or an imposter ? On the other level, it is a movie about our basic conceptions of civilization, and of our myopic tendency to compartmentalize the world into  ""family"" and ""strangers"".
Unlike some of Ray's later works, this movie does not become preachy or unduly morose..rather there is a subtle strain of humor that runs through the entire movie .
Acting-wise, Utpal Dutt, in his last role also, gives us the performance of a lifetime. This movie is all Utpal Dutt and there is noone who could have done justice to the role other than him. The supporting cast is stellar comprising some of the best actors of Bengali cinema. And throughout the movie, the technical polish and consummate artistry that is the stamp of a Ray movie is embellished in each shot.
Great till the very end... the only regret is that we will never  see movie making like this again.",1028332800,7,1156,4.579710144927536
