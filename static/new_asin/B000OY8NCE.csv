2803291,5,B000OY8NCE,"Battlestar Galactica is a re imagining of a great series. Perhaps the show is a little bit too cerebral for some reviewers, but I find the story, characters, and presentation to be top notch. The theme of ""what it means to be human"" as well as the inspection of ""grey"" morality is what leads me to continue watching this show. I am tired of ""simple"" shows and I want something with as much meat as a great novel. I feel that we have this within the frames of ""Battlestar Galactica"".",1196467200,3,482,4.366666666666666
2803292,5,B000OY8NCE,"Those of you who are complaining that this summary does not bring you up to speed and prepare you for season 4, that's because it is not meant to.  It originally aired and was available for download before season 3 started.  It does a great job of wrapping the mini-series and the subsequent seasons into a digestible episode.  It's not meant for BSG fans.  We already know ALL of this.  It's simply a freebe to entice more viewers.  Starting off watching some shows a few seasons in doesn't make much of a difference.  However, with BSG there is a lot that these characters have gone through.  Without a bit of back history new viewers are going to have no clue what is going on and immediately turn away.  This short at least gives them a chance to stay tuned.

That being said.  True fans... it's worth watching to get your fix of anything BSG, total n00bs... it's worth watching to get up to speed, everyone else... don't waste your time.",1196035200,8,942,4.482352941176471
2803293,2,B000OY8NCE,"We like this show, but not all the sex. No plot to it. We don't care about Baltar's sex life or any others. They spend way too much time showing this. If they would make the story more about the journey, and the fight against the cylons, it would improve the series. We loved it when the producers brought in the 2nd Battlestar, but hated the fighting between the commanders. They should bring back a 2nd Battlestar and this time, have them work together to save the fleet. If these writers' would focus more on this instead, they could really bring the show back.  As it is, it seems like it is going to tank if the writers do not stop doing all the useless sex and more on a real story. Developing the stealth craft was great, it gave them an edge on the cylons. We stopped watching the show for these reasons, it is getting boring! Sorry. Wonderful job, however, on the graphics. Beautiful photography. Actors and Actresses do a terrific performance.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-Three/dp/B00129W6LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica - Season Three</a>",1195084800,,1143,5.314917127071824
2803294,4,B000OY8NCE,"Firstly, I have never seen the show.  I love science fiction but usually only in the movies because I find a lot of the sci-fi shows on tv to be low budget with poor scripting and acting.

This show however looks fantastic, if you didn't tell me it was a tv series I'd think it was a movie.  Aside from looking great the story looks to be engaging, exciting and just plain entertaining.  The whole point of this download is to get you into the show and to get you updated on what has happened so far, it does that well, I feel like I could just jump in and start watching the show.

**A warning though, if you plan on buying/watching all of the old Battlestar Galactica episodes in the prior seasons I'd hold of on watching this as it will spoil it for you.**

I recommend taking a look.  And while your at it take a look at the other free download, it's good too.

2803295,2,B000OY8NCE,I haven't seen Battlestar Galactica since 4th grade or so.  My goodness how they've grown in parts and places and such.  This ain't your father's Battlestar I'll tell you that.  I tried to watch the whole thing but just couldn't get over the frat like need for busts and such.  I wanted sci-fi.  Not sci-fi meets Sports Illustrative Swimsuit issue because our story line need some spice (or better writing).  Anyhow... I'm glad this one was free.,1194393600,,446,4.7272727272727275

2803297,1,B000OY8NCE,"I used to like the old Battlestar series,but this is one of the most boring shows I have seen! Poor acting,poor story line and even poorer special effects!",1193529600,4,155,4.571428571428571

2803299,5,B000OY8NCE,"Amazon seems to have combined all the BSG download reviews and spotlighted my previously separate ones of both Season 3 Unbox and Story So Far, so I'm going to update this review to comment on the free downloads and focus on the ones you have to pay for in the other review.

BSG: The Story So Far is an interesting splicing of the highlights of the first two seasons.  While now two seasons behind, it's good as both a quick catchup on older material as well as containing the added bonus of getting to listen to Mary McDonnell narrate the highlights of the journey through New Caprica through Roslin's eyes, which is interesting in itself.  Like some of the best Unbox downloads, it also has better-than-DVD video quality, which is about as good as the series will look if you haven't gotten to watch it in HD.  Recommended.

BSG: Phenomenon is a neat 30 minute tribute to the show by various celebrities, including Joss Whedon of Buffy fame, S. Epatha Merkerson and Jesse Martin of Law and Order, and numerous others.  It's certainly a promo, but what's fun here is that the various stars don't seem to have been hauled in by the ear to talk up the show by the network; they come across as genuine fans who were just pretty excited to get to talk about how they started watching and what they love about the show (and beg for a walk-on cameo before it's over so they can see the sets and meet the cast.)  Good stuff.

BSG: What the Frak is a hilarious 8 minute run through of the first three seasons with a rapid-fire tongue-in-cheek narration.  Won't ruin some of the great lines here, but one example as Tricia Helfer struts: ""There are 12 humanoid Cylon models.  Some actually look like models.""  Probably shouldn't watch if you haven't watched the first three seasons and plan on it eventually; too many spoilers, the humor is inside, and the pace is too much to really get a clue as to what's been going on - but for the fan who's watched it, it's a riot.

Finally, BSG: Revealed is a misnomer and not worth watching.  It's marketed as a sneak preview of Season 4, but there's almost no new material and the commentary by stars and producers on it is mostly old news.  There's also a very annoying banner at the bottom of the screen during the entire broadcast promoting the premiere.  PQ via Unbox is surprisingly mediocre given it and Phenomenon are airing in HD on UHD too.  Not worth it even for free.",1188950400,51,2413,4.474885844748859

2803332,5,B000OY8NCE,"If you need a sci fi show you can binge watch, this is it. Every episode is riveting.

It's so well made. They do a great job of making a story about people fighting robots on spaceships into a very realistic show. That's not an easy challenge. It pulls you into the series so you feel like Battlestars and Vipers and Cylons could be all be real things. It's not a super futuristic space show like Star Trek with digital touch screen panels for everything. The buttons, switches, and keyboards to control everything add a touch of realism.

And its' just a great story.

Season 3 starts with the humans being trapped on a planet with the Cylons. It's a great story arc in the series.

This is just one of the most underrated sci fi shows in history. And yes, I know how it ends. I liked it.",1517184000,,790,4.281879194630872
2803333,2,B000OY8NCE,"A spirited evening with bright friends often takes the tack that sails into AI and how it will one day dominate the human world and become our masters. The Galactica version of the rant is compelling. I'll take a dozen of Cylon  #6. please. Contradictory conjunction: The dark minor chords, the stately rhythm of the scenes, the endless concerned faces delivering predictable speeches - these elements do not carry content that makes use of their structure. Despite a delicious meatball sub from Milano's, I could not willfully suspend my disbelief. This would seem to be a critique of the director, Sergio Mimica-Gezzan.  It is more the result of time. Perhaps, in 2007, I would have been riveted by Season 3.  Alas. I killed my TV and the opportunity passed me by.",1516320000,,766,4.8320610687022905

2803336,4,B000OY8NCE,"Season 3 had some good episodes, particularly at the beginning and end, but some of the middle episodes dragged.
There seemed to be a lot of family confrontations: father/son, mother/daughter, husband wife.  This is supposed to be an action movie, not a remake of ""Long Days Journey into Night"".  I think the writers were just trying to stretch the plot get through the season.  I am surprised there was not an episode in which the Fleet ran out of tobacco.

2803443,4,B000OY8NCE,"This series kinda runs as the polar opposite to Babylon 5 (a prior show by the same creators) in a lot of ways, with the exception of a convoluted, destiny-oriented storyline. It gets a lot too Game-of-Thrones-y where the alliances and backroom deals are concerned sometimes for my tastes. It can be hard to get into at times precisely because of that. Otherwise though the acting is really good in my opinion; James Olmos and Mary McDonnel have to be two of my favorite TV actors of all time. Tricia Helfer really makes her character a lot deeper than her initial oversexed demeanor would suggest. The rest are good enough that the acting sometimes trumps the story line in keeping me into the show.

Beautifully animated, protagonist ships suffer damage, and it stays there to at least some extent. The logistics of a fleet of spacefaring vessels which were never intended for long-term independent operation now finding themselves in exactly such a situation without resupply or dry dock are addressed and indeed major plot points throughout the series.",1480291200,2,1056,4.932584269662922

2803583,5,B000OY8NCE,"This show is amazing. This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I would recommend it to anyone, as long as you're willing to go on a ride. It is a little bleak and deals with some controversial stuff and rarely lets up. There aren't really any funny episodes here. A lot of characters die, and almost all of them do terrible things ""to survive."" This is a show about the end of the world. It's not an easy thing to watch. I heard a review once that said this is the ultimate post-9/11 show, and that line stuck with me. It's terribly true. It reflected its time. This is maybe not it's best season. There are some winners and losers in this season's episodes. The first few are kind of a miniseries in a sense and then it drags in the late middle and the last episodes of the series I did not enjoy. I would never recommend anyone start here- start with the miniseries, of course, and work your way up. I found this season very disappointing at the time, as I recall. There were episodes I absolutely loved and rewatched until I knew every line and some I never, ever rewatched and scoffed at the thought of. It's a journey. It juggles a lot of characters, and this season especially your favorites may end up sort of off-screen or off to the side for several episodes before you check back in with them. A lot of side characters get their moments to shine in this season, their little bottle episodes or story lines. Stick with it. Season four I still despise to this day, but this season is worth your time. The acting is top notch. The storytelling is dark and bold. By the end of this season you have loved every character AND hated every character, and very, very few shows can do that.",1455408000,,1699,4.29595015576324

2803613,5,B000OY8NCE,"My favorite tv series of all time. It's sci-fi, but even people who are not at all technically savvy love this show. It focuses more on the military side of things, and leaves out a lot of the techni-babble you hear in other series like Stargate and others. While tv is bound to sacrifice some scientific fact here and there, this series does a very good job of making everything as realistic and close to the laws of physics as possible. It's a good mix of sci-fi, love and drama, and military/political issues.",1447113600,,512,4.516129032258065

2803691,5,B000OY8NCE,I loved every season of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. Every season seemed to have a cliff hanger keeping me on the edge of my seat until the next season began. The best part of streaming is you don't have to wait for another season to air.,1431302400,,245,4.23404255319149
2803692,5,B000OY8NCE,"Season 3 is often thought to be the weakest season of BSG, but it's still way better than 99% of TV. The season kicks off with a bang, with most of humanity under oppressive Cyclon occupation on the dreary New Caprica, where it's apparently always raining; Tigh leads resistance fighters, including suicide bombers, while Adama plans a rescue mission from the safety of Galactica. As always, the focus is on human-scale emotions despite the epic, end-of-the-world situation. The effects were spotty - Galactica dropping into atmosphere was one of the most breathtaking spaceship scenes I've ever seen, Pegasus saving the day was another unforgettable scene, but the Cylon basestars seem like cheesy, 1970's sci-fi sets that were dug out of storage. Even the music for the basestar scenes is boring elevator-music. There are also more stand-alone episodes in this season which can cause the plot to drag, though they typically focus on giving us a closer understanding of what makes the characters tick. Minor characters like Gaeta and Tyrol become a bigger focus. If you're going to skip episodes, the non-skippable ones to watch are the Exodus episodes, the Eye of Jupiter story arc, the Maelstrom story arc, and Crossroads (Baltar's trial). Finally, this season gets pretty dark. Characters are put in terrible situations - we see a whole new side of Tigh on New Caprica. We see another beloved main character basically lose it after the emotional trauma of the last 2 seasons. Stick with it - the end of the season is classic what-does-it-mean-to-be-human BSG philosophy, and it sets up for the unbelievably awesome 4th season.",1431216000,,1630,5.085820895522388
2803693,5,B000OY8NCE,"I am a huge BSG fan that decided to complete my collection of BSG DVDs. I ordered seasons 2, 3, 4 and 4.5 from Amazon and they all arrived in a timely fashion in different shipments. All of the different seasons came in their respective bundles shrink wrapped.  I was finishing up season 2.5 and looking foward to  my up coming weekend marathon of BSG season 3. I put in DVD 1 and all was good. I took out #2 and WTF its a Blank recordable DVDR. There is no label, theres no recording, nothing but blank. #3 was all good but #4 was again a blank no label DVDR and #5 was fine.
I checked all of the other series and there wasn't any other problem with the DVDs. I noticed the binder was a bit beat up and the shrink wrap felt different from the other series binders. Perhaps a repackage was done I don't know.  But naturally Amazon took care of it and even sent it 2 day delivery. It was a good job by customer service @ Amazon.

2803766,4,B000OY8NCE,"Series three started off with the same pace and narrative drive as series two but somehow seemed to run out of steam in the middle before getting back on track for an excellent finale.

It could be argued that the mid-series doldrums were for a bit of light relief from the break-neck pace and allowed for episodes which provided much needed depth to the main characters and, in this respect, they succeeded. There was, however, far too much reliance on flash-backs and irritating conversations with people who were not there (not just between Baltar and the skinny blonde for a change).

Every sci-fi series seems to suffer from the occasional duff episode (even Babylon 5 had a few) so it isn't fair to be over critical; it is probably because the remaining episodes are so good that you notice the sporadic poor ones",1420934400,,819,4.72027972027972

2803780,5,B000OY8NCE,"When Science Fiction became stale and the television landscape filled with the reality nonsense this show appeared to push the envelope of science fiction and drama. Turning a cheesy 70's sci-fi show into one of the greatest remakes ever to be produced.

The creators of this masterpiece were able to take something that was so memorable in the 70's and flip it until it only resembled the past, but turn it into something even more memorable and relevant today. By taking modern issues and creating allegories for us to study and learn by, this show pushed our imagination and allowed us for a brief moment to submit to the possibility of greatness.

Each hour of this show is a non-stop critique of our own weaknesses, with a lesson to be hopeful. In the years since this show went off the air, I have hoped for something great to come back to Syfy, sadly though in that time nothing approaches what this show achieved, instead we are left with the cheesy movie of the week and WWE wrestling.

If you have never seen this show, I highly recommend picking up all four seasons of this and watching them multiple times over, as its as much intellectually stimulating as it is action-based.",1419292800,,1188,4.647619047619048

Never watched when it was originally on,recently stuck inside been watching Everything I never did before but anyway,love BG,it is a scyfy soap opera,an adventure,a love story that actually follows through. The characters develop and develop and develop,who could not like this show I cannot imagine. If you never watched before,give it a chance,watch a few episodes,you will get hooked,well,I did,obviously. O,just try it,you will see it is good stuff",1405123200,,489,5.621621621621622
2803957,4,B000OY8NCE,"Entertaining. I like syfy so I could not stop watching. There is an interesting ""spiritual"" approach that goes on in every episode which even includes some psych characters, or even a ""machine"" that is always in a ""bathtub"" that seems to be a spiritual guide which ""mind"" goes bac and forth from past to future. I am not sure if that is it yet. On the other hand the humans continue being ""humans"" with all their imperfection and vicious attitudes not different from what we have been living since the world is world. Another interesting thing is that I have not seem any aliens, like a big ugly bug or those mutants from other syfy movies. No. There are the humans, machines that look like human and that even thing they are humans ( some very attractive by the way) and machines that look like robots. In the whole Universe where the Battlestar Galactica travels there is no other specie. Oh well. The best is just watch it without much compromise. Just for fun, I guess.

2803987,5,B000OY8NCE,You don't have to be a science fiction fan to like this show.  The writers have created good stories with interesting characters that you can't help but care about. The acting is well done and the special effects are good for tv.,1403913600,,229,4.4523809523809526
2804017,5,B000OY8NCE,"You really have to see seasons 1 and 2 to follow along with series, but each episode is interesting on its own. Admiration goes to the actors and series details, as each intertwines the past set of episodes into the newer ones, with added intrigue and drama as the race to Earth continues. Animation and science fiction detail add to the realism, although most of the scenes are more about societal changes and moral issues that make each episode build on the next.",1403913600,,465,4.614457831325301

2804020,5,B000OY8NCE,Arguably one of the best seasons of an amazing show that transcends simple sci-fi action dramas. Just the Exodus episodes make this worth owning. I own hundreds of DVD's but this is one of my favorites.,1403481600,,202,4.638888888888889
2804021,2,B000OY8NCE,"Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great.  Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin.  I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3.  The first two seasons I couldn't believe I had missed this show when it was on, after season 3 I'm speechless at the waste of time it was.  All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons, and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were, but to waste a season on it?  The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free?  I've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk?  Its not a letdown, it is maddening that I wasted the time.  I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god.  Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching.  All the background on the Admirals marriage, and the character background should have been boiled down to 10% of the first two seasons, not stretched through an entire season 3.  Oh, and let's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods.  Frak them all.",1403308800,,1446,4.354477611940299
2804022,3,B000OY8NCE,"This series just keeps getting wacky.  From a military perspective on this fictional event, the civilians can go ""frack"" themselves if they think they're in charge.",1403222400,,164,5.3076923076923075

2804049,5,B000OY8NCE,"Full disclosure, I've watched e entire series twice, and am watching it again now for want of some good sci-fi that has been sorely lacking since BSG went off the air. What's amazing to me is that I'm still gleaning new details on the third watching, what with the multi-layered storytelling, excellent writing, acting, and direction. In fact, I can now tell when Rhymer directed an episode based on the feel of action, dialog and special effects.  BSG is really, really good, and well worth the time if you appreciate well written, complex drama that just happens to take place among the stars.",1402099200,,595,4.776699029126213

The casting is amazing and I've found faces that I look for in other shows; Tamoh Penikett, Katie Sackhoff and Jamie Bamber and the list goes on.  Ronald Moore and David Eick did a super job of reimaging the original series.  The character interactions are amazing.  Some of the plots twists caught me off guard and wanting more. If non-scifi people would give it a chance, they'd most likely love the story and become fans.",1402099200,,536,4.760869565217392
2804051,5,B000OY8NCE,"BG is an outstanding series with fabulous actors and storylines daring to touch highly sensitive and controversial themes without succumbing to the temptation of banalization. Some of the religious underpinnings are somewhat ludicrous, but I assume that any other choice would have angered a lot of people (I don't know any living believer in the Greek mythological gods). None of the main characters is flat, two-dimensional, and each of the actors is capable of showing the complexity. Highly recommended!",1401667200,,507,5.430379746835443

The characters you will NEVER forget. It is a hugely deep seeded introspection into the why and why not of being human, leading to questioning what is human and where does humanity come from and to to.
If you want to think, to delve into the mind Battlestar is gift.

The one caveat I have about this season is it gets a bit bogged down with dysfunctional relationships - not exactly a sci-fi centerpiece. However it is still part of an excellent series and if slogging through a bit of relationship angst is necessary to move the storyline along, so be it.

But it did end on a high note and I cant wait to begin BSG S4 (I will not explain what BSG S4 is because you probably know what it is.

Much of the characterization  the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this, the third season. I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations, whether well-considered or foolish, with pride, joy, fear, or disapproval.

I was young when the original series debuted and don't remember much of it, so I didn't come into this series with too much baggage.  For me, it started off great - I like a lot of the characters and the portrayals.  I loved Edward James Olmos in Miami Vice and he nails it here as Commander Adama.  But in Season 3 things start to get a bit crazy.  The prime example is the transformation of Gaius Baltar from scientist to politician t pariah to... fighter for the underclass?  Also, there seem to be more filler episodes - understandable to an extent for a 26-episode season, but do people really want to watch an episode about labor relations on a science fiction show?",1394409600,2,772,4.363636363636363

They each are amazing characters and each makes me cry for their despair and for their happiness. The way that the actors each show the pain that they are going through is amazing.

2804253,5,B000OY8NCE,"I have tremendously enjoyed watching Battlestar Galactica. The settings, the characters, and the battle scenes in space gave me many hours of entertainment.

Human beings living on a planet called Caprica are besieged by the Cylons, the machines they created to serve them. When the Cylons evolve beyond human capabilities, they become their mortal enemy. The Cylons now look at the humans living on Caprica as superfluous, and they must be destroyed. The Cylons nuke Caprica and the remaining 50,000 human survivors must leave their contaminated planet in a fleet of ships. The common theme in all the scenes is the driving mission for the human race to find earth. As the fleet of ships move through space they have to fight the stalking Cylons.

The cast of characters has to fight as well their own demons. The president of the fleet, Laura Roslin, a Secretary of Education in her previous life, is elected to take the reins and steer the fleet in the search for Earth. She is, however, dying of a terminal disease. Commander Adama still mourns the death of his older son, while being estranged from his younger son. Kara, nicknamed 'Starbuck', is the fleet's ace pilot. Her mission is to seek out Cylon's ships and destroy them. Deep down, she carries a deep secret that drives her to drink heavily to drown feelings of guilt. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew fights the Cylons and their close call with death, by living hard and fast, for each day may be their last.

As I watched this high octane series, I couldn't help thinking about our planet earth and her fragile habitat. Are the Cylons, perhaps, in each one of us?

A highly recommended series!",1392336000,,1657,4.743055555555555

The plots and storyline could be applicable to life as we know it but also being relevant to the futuristic fantasy world they are set in, however,I feel that this season is not as good as the first two, the plots seem to be somewhat redundant and perhaps darker than before and not as strong. Sometimes trying a little too hard to be politically correct in it's attempt to transfer all of the problems of our world and applying them to theirs. After all, isn't part of the reason we watch T.V. is to occasionally escape reality or for the suspension of belief.",1391558400,,642,4.358333333333333

2804308,4,B000OY8NCE,"Not quite as good as the first two seasons but the bar was set pretty high there.  The first two seasons are incredibly imaginative and creative and they created this world with seemingly limitless possibilities.  However, this season feels like it is trying to hard to mirror current or historical affairs and unfortunately I think that distracts from what made seasons 1 and 2 so good.  Also most of the characters you might have liked before become just annoying.

2804310,2,B000OY8NCE,"so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar...truly awesome, military sci/fi show, insane sets, great plot, good acting and those Cylons. all great....

the end of season two had some difficulties. alot ALOT less action and more crying. lots of crying. lots of drama. lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.

season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust....i truly cant take Starbuck anymore, whiny brat...could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.

entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons.....which, lets be honest...is the best thing about the show.

it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi' alltogether.

terrible mistake.... i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar....you had a AMAZING thing going.",1390694400,3,864,5.142857142857143

2804343,5,B000OY8NCE,"I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica so this review is heavily slanted towards the positive.  That being said, the show continues to surprise even years after it went off the air.  Season three is a great continuation of the humans from the 12 colonies, searching for the lost 13th tribe on the distant planet Earth.  The season begins with a bang and ends with a great cliffhanger.
For those who are not familiar with the new version of Battlestar, this is a fantastic reworking of the original 1970's show.  Ronald Moore(Helix) and David Eik have created a Scifi masterpiece that will capture your imagination with incredible sets and unforgettable characters.  If you are into scifi shows like Firefly or Star trek, you will not be disappointed.  It would take to long to list the episodes and give a synopsis for each, so go get this show, sit back and enjoy.",1390089600,2,866,4.6644736842105265

I have my problems with what come's next. The Cylons disappears for a long while, which is not bad  by itself, if only these absence wasn't filled with so many episodes not that interesting about the humans. The show's mythology also takes a convoluted route I didn't like with prophecies and Higher Forces acting behind the humans/cylons conflict.",1389139200,,489,4.963414634146342

2804378,5,B000OY8NCE,"If you've not seen the newer Battlestar Galactica, you really should.  It is great Science Fiction.  Heck, it is just a great story, period!  This is a series best watched in ""binges;"" that is, watch an entire season in one week, preempting your normal TV viewing.  When you do that, it is much more like watching a movie, or a serial movie, than it is a TV series.  There's action, adventure, romance, war, life-or-death situations and decision, emergencies, subterfuges, blackmail, treachery, even treason!  Not to mention some of the prettiest Cylon models this side of the Galaxy.

One could nitpick this little thing or that minor nuance...but hey, this is great television.  Enjoy it.

One caution:  There are many scenes inappropriate for younger than 14, and more probably up to 17 or 18.  Even as an adult, I find myself keeping the remote in my hand to be able to fast forward through some of the spicier scenes.  That is the single negative critique I'd have of this series, and it is not a trivial critique.  The newer BG is NOT something to let your kids watch willy-nilly; just because the old series was PG-rated.

Again, a very good show...just keep the remote handy.",1388275200,,1183,4.735294117647059

I watched most of this while doing other stuff, like cooking or cleaning up around the house, which is good because if I had been paying full attention to this I might have lost it. The most annoying thing to me was what they do to Lee Adama's character. They should have given him another (living) sibling because lee has to handle all the various ways a father/son relationship can be strained and it's too much for one character. I got sick of the rollercoaster-ride of his character development--from Fat Lee to noble commander, then back to CAG (which seemed like a major regression since it accompanied the rekindling of his romance with Kara--in the boxing episode with flashbacks, which was, in my opinion, the WORST of the series), and then to.. lawyer and politician? He's putty. And then there's Gaius, who suddenly transforms into a revolutionary in jail, and it turns out he's a farm boy who worked himself up to the top? Not believable.

I am, by the way, a SiFi/Fantasy Fiction fan. However, on Amazon Prime, I was able to watch JUST the story and characters and got so involved I ""Binged"" for two weeks through all 4 seasons. The story line and sub-plots are addicting, the characters appealing and multi-layered (including the villains!) and the production excellent all the way around.

But it could have gone on longer and JM and the other guy could have been replaced in stead of ditching the show. The wonderful actors are having a hard time getting roles. I do not understand that. Boomer is doing well on Hawaii 50. Starbuck on Longmire, too bad. President Roslyn on Major Crimes a major successful shift. The chief was spotted on some show last week as a lesser cop, too bad, he is great. who have I missed?",1374883200,,570,4.287037037037037

I cannot think of a series where I enjoyed the ending more. I highly recommend this series to all fans of intense drama as well as fans of science fiction",1374624000,,308,4.15
2804552,5,B000OY8NCE,"The conclusion of Season 2.5 had one of the most dramatic cliffhangers in all of television.  The Colonials, who had been living peacefully (if not happily) upon New Caprica for over a year, were discovered by the Cylons (courtesy of nuclear explosion on Cloud 9 following the presidential election) and had their planet invaded and the population enslaved, while the Pegasus and Galactica (and the remaining space-bound ships) made an emergency escape because they were in no condition for a fight.

  Season 3 begins with the occupation in full force.  Slave labor and prison camps are the norm.  Baltar is merely a puppet leader forced to do the Cylons' bidding.  A resistance movement is also making life hell on the occupiers.  The early episodes are spectacular, especially to the 2-part ""Exodus"" episode where Galactica and Pegasus return to rescue the Colonials from New Caprica.

  The high-wire action is followed by the aftermath of how the fleet comes to terms with that horrible occupation.  Secret tribunals seeking retribution against those humans who collaborate with the Cylons, and Gaius Baltar's own responsibility, have a clear representation in the controversy over the real-world issues of detainees in Guantanamo Bay and other underground `black' prisons.  A divide also begins to form among fleet members who were trapped on New Caprica during the occupation and those who escaped with the Battlestars and then staged the rescue.  All the while, the journey towards Earth continues.

  There are a few more standalone episodes, which serve as info dumps, in Season 3 because this is the only season of a full slate of episodes without a mid-year finale.  However, there a very few weak points.  Morality continues to play a major role as the fleet tries to determine how far they are willing to go to defeat the Cylons and how they will continue to address the issue of actions of those who worked with them.

  Several mind-blowing revelations occur as the season moves on, and some of the characters get greater opportunities to shine.  Sharon Valerii (now under the call sign ""Athena"") has earned Adama's trust enough to become a full fledged officer, but continues to deal with resentment and personal conflict over her Cylon heritage.  Starbuck's coping with her own PTSD following the escape from New Caprica is a major theme.

  It should come as no surprise that Season 3 ended with another major plot twist; one which will make the heads of first time viewers spin (that is all I will say about it).  However, the journey continues to be an incredibly enjoyable component of this whole series.",1374451200,,2626,5.002309468822171

2804619,3,B000OY8NCE,"This was a memorable season for the show, revealing a lot of tension.  I am not sure, however, how satisfying it was.  Yes, I'm giving the season three stars and they produced quality work.  However, while I am enjoying the events, I'm not sure that I'm enjoying the characters.  I find myself in the odd position of not being sure if humanity -- as represented by the main characters -- is worth saving.  All of these people are deeply flawed.  I don't feel actual respect for any of them.  Of course, they are in a situation like none in which I have been, so perhaps I'm being overly harsh.

Battlestar Galactica is a decent show.  The actors for the most part do their jobs well and the individual stories are interesting.  I'm just finding myself questioning whether I should be rooting for the enemy... or for anyone at all.",1368489600,,830,4.510067114093959

Battlestar Galactica extends the message by introducing the human-looking, human-feeling, human-behaving Cylons, posing the question of how different are humans from these machines. In the end, I suppose humans are biological machines, and the difference between biological machines and the electronic machines in the story is not much.

After viewing the Dirty Hands episode of Battle Star Galactica I am feeling inspired to doing just that. Dirty Hands&, in my mind follows precisely this very same line of thinking of integrity B.S.

I love the characters, and the rediculousness of the Baltar character, and the situations he finds himself in.  The acting is what really amazes me.  It is not your common scifi series with the low budget acting. Edward James Olmos is always steady and composed, delivering these completely perfect performances, and the performance of the ensemble that comprises the crew is tremendously understated, and each character seems perfectly cast.

can see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.

2804761,4,B000OY8NCE,"Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.

Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.

Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.

I love some of the individual episodes from Season 3. Starting off the season with much of the crew forced under Cylon occupation was brilliant. We get to see the characters really put through the ringer. And they change. There are some really compelling moments. One of my favorite episodes focuses on labor disputes in the fleet. It's a small glimpse into life for the hoi polloi in BSG, but it really makes you ponder what life would be like under such circumsances.

That said, Season 3 is the point at which BSG really started to jump the shark for me. While I liked the idea of beginning the series with part of the crew under Cylon occupation, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. I still haven't gotten over the idea that they're perfect imitations of people. However, in Season 3, the Cylons just leave any pretense of being machines. They act like people in all but name. They have petty jealousies, fall in love, and argue amongst each other. Worst of all, several of the episodes follow Gaius Baltar on a Cylon base ship and there's a ""love bed"" on the ship! A bed with bright red sheets and plushy mattress just for Baltar and his Cylon women. I definitely started getting sick of the Cylons by this point.

Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like where Season 3 is taking the larger story. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.",1356480000,,2748,4.764705882352941
2804762,5,B000OY8NCE,"It's gritty, raw, and sometimes shocking.  The writers picked up bits and pieces from the original series, but added a lot of new work to make it fresh.  It is no longer a campy family show, it's a full on evening sci-fi adult drama.  You're never quite sure where it will go next, but it may actually be too intense for many.

I've used the same review for all seasons, it's one big story, to review each season is like reviewing one glove.",1354924800,,441,4.27710843373494

This show was soooo good in fact, that it did not belong on the SciFi channel, but rather on a better funded channel.  SciFi is known far more, even today POST Galactica, as a channel that spends a goodly amount of time and money making utterly horrific sci fi crud, like the one about the giant (?) sea lobster thingy.

This episode was amazing. The two part judging of Gaius Baltar was really good to. The revealing of 4 more Cylons out of the final five was amazing; especially when you find out who they are. It blew my mind to find out. Anyway, this episode, and the last one, have an intriguing element, the music, that is interesting and weird. I don't really understand why music, but it probably has some meaning. The build up in this series has been really great. This series is now in my top 5. I don't know where to put it. It's awesome. To anyone who hasn't seen this episode or the last one yet, don't skip these, these are very important and amazing episodes. You'll be blown away at the end of this episode, of that I assure you. Really, I do have to wonder who the fifth Cylon is. That's the question that will probably echo through the next season. Great season, awesome series so far, can't wait to watch the next season.
Oh, final note, as I didn't list it before. You get to see a someone you didn't expect to see in this episode. Plus, that person has news, great news. It's interesting to see that person again. It really adds to the excitement of the ending of this season. I had to wonder if Lee was hallucinating or not at the end. However, I'm going to guess no, even though that is a really mind-boggling idea. The music at the end was a really big help as it really did add to what was going on; a perfect element to add.

Great episode. This episode was really needed. It makes a lot of sense when you think about it. I enjoyed how Admiral Adama once again introduced his wisdom and worked to try and help with his crew. Also, the main element along with the basic fighting element, Kara (Starbuck) and Lee. Now, we've all seen how things between them have been...hmm...interesting. They've always had feelings, both good and bad towards one another that rise to the surface on occasion. The whole iteration of their relationship is really good. The story really allows it to unfold. The interesting plot twist is how she gets married right after saying how she loves Lee. Most people would probably say she has commitment issues. I think she's got a few problems. The fight between the two of them is great as it allows them to blow off the steam that they've been building up for who knows how long and finally get together. Now the hard part is going to be what happens next. Kara (Starbuck) got married, and so did Lee, so this is going to be really interesting. I foresee two divorces coming up. Anyway, not to make divorce sound great here, I'll move on (note: I don't like divorce. Please, don't commentate on that if you have a point. I'm not getting into a debate on divorce and will not respond to a comment that looks like the person wants an argument on divorce. I am simply commentating my feelings towards it). So, this episode was a good releasing of tension for the series. I enjoyed it. This series is really good. Alright, onto the next episode.",1349568000,2,1566,4.5964285714285715

Kara's a frak-up.  Lee's an insufferable twit.  Their character flaws serve as the basis for the majority of the side-plot turned main plot, and it's about as annoying as they can make it.  The pace and frequency of flashbacks is jarring and pointless, and the fact that these character flaws (the same ones, again and again) are driven to the point of inanity.

Given the chance to wipe out the cylons once and for all with a bio weapon, Rosalin says ""you're terminated, mother frakkers.""  Adama gets queasy thinking about how his interminable struggle for survival might just come to an abrupt halt.  He's got his back against the wall, the cylons have dropped the nuclear hammer, the rock is between Adama and a hard place, the fan has hit the space merde, and the bath water has gotten thrown out with Hera, the bionic baby.

Helo decides destruction of the cylons can't be on the agenda and kills the captive cylons before they can be introduced into the cylon population.  He keeps the soul train rolling.  Adama keeps his soul by promising never to use the peculiar encephalitis to wipe out the cylons ever.  But really--how much trouble would it have been to capture a single cylon, infect him, and execute him for resurrection?  This should have been the series finale.

""I, Borg"" was another oeuvre of RDM.  Watch it.  It's the same story.  And Picard gets chewed out later on for not going through with genocide against Starfleet's #1 cybernetic foe, the Borg.  Apparently some other writer recognized how much of a blunder that plot represented.  There was never an explicit acknowledgement in BSG.  Do you really just ignore existential threats?

and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,
not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a
great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop
show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generally
the blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.
However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problem
and I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there was
a slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhaps
it was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefully
it seemed more a reproduction problem.

This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but accept
as an artistic decision.

Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy
(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might want
to make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the best
you can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the later
discs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too late
to ask for an exchange.

None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode the
occasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wife
never noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).

As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as though
you can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuate
quickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the math
and figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.
(And you will want the complete set)

Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray box
set for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extras
as the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",1320796800,2,3398,4.513029315960912

The careful crafting of a story so elquently done in both the pilot episode and season 1 are no where to be found towards the end of season 2.5 or 3.  As the show has progressed it has become a very simply written, spiritual, religious mess and the characters are not as cohesively developed as they once were.  The writers must have changed.

DVD CONFUSION
-------------------------------------------------------
The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.

========================================

OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD
-------------------------------------------------------
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from customer Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.

BOTTOM LINE:
-------------------------------------------------------
As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:
(1) Buy either one of the Blu-Ray sets or the Gray DVD set.
(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).

NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------
-The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!

2804824,2,B000OY8NCE,"I would definitely concur with Joshua Feldman's fine review that Season Three was the weakest of all the BSG seasons overall.

Yes, sure, the 'escape from New Caprica' episode was killer, as was the Eye of Jupiter mini-arc in the middle of the season. But there were plenty and plenty of 'throwaway' episodes throughout ('The Woman King' stands out as especially bad), and perhaps worse, a lot of characters seemed poorly-written in this season.

Starbuck comes especially to mind... she's absolutely wonderful and badass in other seasons, but in much of S3 she becomes a whiney, self-centered brat, for lack of a better term. And the continuing romantic drama/quadrangle between her and Apollo and their significant others was strangely annoying, not poignant or heartbreaking. Another Season 2 ball fumbled in S3.

Heck, even the whole New Caprica arc early on seems one lost opportunity after another, the fantastic 'escape' episode aside... showrunner Ronald D. Moore and friends tried too hard to make it into an Iraq allegory, rather than letting that message grow organically out of the situation. Too heavy-handed, and too obvious.

(and strangely, too low-tech... the Cylons didn't appear to have any better way to keep tabs on the imprisoned colonials than we do nowadays... doesn't seem realistic, honestly)

The big show trial at the end of S3 also falls very flat, if you bother to be discerning at all about it... while I very much liked the character of Romo Lampkin, it seemed incredibly ridiculous that Apollo was suddenly going to became this first-rate lawyer and lynchpin of Baltar's legal team.

To be fair to Season Three though, this is not the first time BSG has engaged in this sort of silliness... Starbuck doubled as a SWAT team sniper in S1 for example. Apparently, one of the 'Big Three' characters (Apollo, Starbuck, Adama) MUST be involved in any major action, no matter what. One can envisage Adama elbowing Doc Codell away from a patient during a major surgery scene, having suddenly developed elite brain surgery skills, lol.

I'll draw flack from the less discerning fans for saying this, I know, but really, you can skip most of S3 safely... you're really not missing much.

S4 is better, though not as much better as you might like.

The indispensable new BSG remains the Mini-series, S1, and the majority of S2, up until those late-season S2 clinker episodes started showing up ('Sacrifice', 'Black Market'). This is what happens when you go from 13-episode seasons to 20-episode seasons... quality inevitably suffers. ""Just not enough time to make every episode special""... this is a quote from Ron Moore himself regarding this issue. And... he's very much right.

That said, the new BSG remains one of my favorite shows, its low lights not withstanding. I just wish the good times could've lasted a bit longer than they did.",1280275200,9,2864,4.9978991596638656

I think in some ways it's my favourite season, and the courtroom scenes in 'Crossroads' held me absolutely riveted to my screen.

As this is true across the board I'd ordered American versions of Seasons 1, 2.5 and 4.5 and was delighted with 1 and 4.5. 2.5 was a disappointment because none of the special features apart from the extended version of 'Pegasus' was subtitled. Before I buy Season 3, could someone tell me what the subtitling status is there?

2804837,2,B000OY8NCE,"Battlestar Galactica started out as a military science fiction show (though its science is nonsense). In its second season it became a political drama. In its third season it became a soap opera with cheating spouses, a mnage  trois, emoting Cylons, sex scenes and many shots of nearly nude hunks, dream sequences, imaginary lovers, etc. I assume that the producers and writers decided to abandon the original fans (mostly males who liked action stories) and appeal to soap opera-loving females.

Of note is that the genre changes of Battlestar Galactica failed. Viewership declined throughout the second season and declined more rapidly during the third season. The show's Nielson ratings averaged 2.3 in season 1, 1.9 in season 2, and 1.4 in season 3.

2804838,5,B000OY8NCE,"Overall, I'd say season three is good because, of course, it advances the story, though it does tend to drag a little in the middle of the season what with Baltar becoming a religious icon.  Additionally, some of the stand alone stories don't seem that interesting considering what all is going on, and what I, as a viewer, wanted to know, such as just who were the final five Cylons.  However, fat Apollo is just tongue-in-cheek enough to be interesting.  Also, some of the extended episodes don't really seem worth it, especially since there are deleated scenes and commentary.  I would have rather had another episode.  Just buy the frakin' thing already!  So say we all already.",1275177600,,682,4.786324786324786
2804839,4,B000OY8NCE,"I agree with the top reviewer that this was the weakest link in the 4 season chain that is ""Battlestar Galactica"".  This season is almost all about character development and does much to deepen our understanding of the emotional baggage that some of the main characters are lugging around that influence and explain many of their decisions.  However, this process necessarily involves a slowing of the dramatic pace and story progression.  This season is back-fill, not new ground.  Even so, this season is still better than 99% of what's out there in the sci-fi universe and absolutely necessary viewing for series continuity understanding.",1271289600,4,641,5.194174757281553

2804844,5,B000OY8NCE,"BSG Season 3 (Region 1 version), contains all the aspects of Season 3 that our pathetic Region 4 version avaliable here in New Zealand contains....plus those our local version does not offer, for which I rate it. Highly. Thank the gods for multizone DVD players and the ability to order in this magnificent and complete version of Season 3 via Amazon. This is becoming a habit...having to order in superior (complete) versions of parts of the show from Region 1 sources overseas because the inadequite versions they release here just don't cut it. Thank you, Amazon for (again) filling a gap in the series for me. Why is it that us poor region 4 people like me down here in New Zealand have to put up with substandard versions of our favourite show (BSG) sold across the counter in our local shops that include only incomplete versions of everything? Our R4 Season 2: missing deleted scenes from 2nd half and with only the regular version of the ""Pegasus"" ep, our R4 ""Razor"", only the rated (incomplete) version, only the unrated R1 version is complete, now our R4 Season 3: cool as DVD intro with scenes from the ""Exodus Pt 2"" capital ship battle, I'll admit;...but containing only the episodes...nothing else!!!!! No deleted scenes, no webisodes, and only the regular version of ""Unfinished Business""....do the companies involved in their release not give a damn? Are they so out of touch that they think, oh, New Zealand, they are so far away, they won't care for the full versions of BSG, only American fans will want or be interested in versions containing the full nine yards?? Well, please wake up, take a long hard look at yourselves and kindly release the full versions to all fans, everywhere. The fact is that with a show like BSG, there is no such thing as a ""casual fan"". There is only one kind of fan that exists for a series like this; the committed and completist hardcore fan who wants every little piece of the series in his or her (yes her...there are many female fans of this fine series and good on them..) collection. Edward James Olmos would be furious if he learned that New Zealand and probably many other non - R1 fans are only offered incomplete versions of the show...I have read he values fans and supports their access to all his projects they may be interested in from his career, both television and stage. It is something you company execs need to take seriously, as it shows you have the respect to take us fans seriously.
Season 3 starts off slowly with the colonists and the bulk of the civilian ships still trapped on Cylon - Occupied New - Caprica after their arrival at the end of Season 2, and only a token contingent of the fleet plus both battlestars with only minimal crews planning their rescue from their secret location in space. Things then then build quickly to the magnificent ""Exodus Part 2"" major space battle where the Galactica and Pegasus put everything on the line to break out the bulk of humanity by engaging their Cylon captors' motherships in one of the biggest battles of the entire BSG series. The rest of the first half is quite exciting, following duel plotlines like in Season 1 where the story alternated between the fleet and Helo on Caprica. So early (Post New - Caprica) Season 3 alternates between the fleet and Gaius Baltar onboard the Cylon Fleet. One episode, (""Hero""), even shows flashbacks to Admiral Adama's battlestar he commanded prior to Galactica, Battlestar Valkaryie, in a dark and disturbing pre - war mission. The Season reaches a strong plateau with a three episode run, ""The Passage"", ""The Eye Of Jupiter"" and ""Rapture"" dealing with the fleet crossing a dangerous star cluster to reach a planet to mine for a food source. However the civilian fleet jumps away when the Cylons arrive leaving a tense two - episode standoff between Galactica, (the sole defender of the fleet after the breakout battle of Exodus Pt 2) and four Cylon Baseships with a Resurrection Ship. The latter half of the series is a very dark and depressing series of episodes dealing with internal human - fleet issues, Starbuck's Death and the final ""battle"", which is not a buildup to a space confrontation, but a legal drama of the trial of Baltar after his recent involuntary return to humanity. However, in it's last phase, Season 3 still has a few surprises...four of the members of the ""final five"" cylons are revealed, and the series ends with a cliffhanger on an action footing, a ship to ship confrontation with a Cylon ambush spiced up by the return of Starbuck in the closing moments. Season 3 has higher highs then Season 2 before it, but lower lows also. It also starts to unfold the plot. This is an interesting, but at times quiet, Season in the overall series. But it is worth it if only for ""Exodus Pt 2"" alone...which is one of the best hours of Science Fiction I have seen.",1262908800,,4847,4.670175438596491

I battled through some boring episodes and then bam I was hooked, right about the end of Season 2.  And then season three hit and I figured it was going to go bad yet again being away from the ship, on New Caprica, but it was actually better. The show developed this interesting pull.

2804869,2,B000OY8NCE,"I held off watching BSG until the series had run to a close, and was greatly impressed by Season 1. Season 2, although it had its low points, was also excellent. By contrast, Season 3 is an assortment of low points punctuated by the occasional great scene or episode.

I have to agree with other reviewers who have noted that the drama throughout Season 3 felt contrived and overwrought. The biggest issue in my opinion is that I couldn't confidently say of the writers, ""And they have a plan."" Conflicts between characters are drawn out seemingly to fill time; the Cylons transform from frightening to nonsensical; compelling questions from earlier seasons are answered badly while uninteresting - or downright annoying - twists are introduced.

There are some very entertaining high points in BSG Season 3... but they don't begin to make up for all the lows.",1254787200,5,860,4.883561643835616
2804870,4,B000OY8NCE,"The 3rd season of Battlestar Galactica begins with the scene on New Caprica.  Tight loses his wife, and Starbuck loses her emotional stability at the hands of the Cylon occupiers.  The colonists on New Caprica are then rescued by a carefully orchestrated surprise mission by Pegasus and Galactica, and the series goes back to the search for Earth.  In between, Starbuck is killed, and then comes back to life; and Balter is imprisoned on a Cylon ship, then imprisoned on Galactica.  We also have 4 of the 5 humanoid cyclons revealed, along with President Roslin's re-acquintance with cancer.  So overall, a very eventful season.  Probably the high points are the dialogue, of which numerous scenes stand out.  Some of the best include Apollo's defense of Baltar at the latter's trial, Six's explanation of projection to Baltar while on a baseship, Ellen's defense of herself to Tigh, Starbuck's taunting of numerous other people, and Romo's elaborations of justice and the legal system.  The script itself has numerous holes.  Probably the biggest holes are in the early episodes on New Caprica.  The cylons clearly have the technology to monitor the entire range of electro-magnetic, thermal and acoustic radiation, yet they resort to tent-by-tent search and seizures of colonists.  these glaring plot holes continue throughout the season and conclude with the trial of Baltar in the last 2 episodes; Cross-Roads 1 and 2.  Neither the prosecution nor the defense calls Baltar to the stand, which is unheard of.  And the show does not give any explanation as to why he is not called to testify.  But overall, still a good show.",1254009600,,1627,5.022388059701493

2804872,5,B000OY8NCE,"I'm a newcomer to ""Battlestar Galactica"" and am only now watching the series on DVD.  After a somewhat lackluster Season 2.5, BSG got back on track with an action-packed Season 3.  The colonialists have settled on New Caprica, only to be invaded again by the Cylons, although the Cylons have a different intention this time.  The season is full of action and intriguing plotlines, as the colonialists mount a resistance movement to escape from New Caprica, which reverberates throughout the entire season.

Season 3 contains some extremely strong plotlines and episodes.  I was particularly impressed with ""Collaborators"" in which the resistance deals with the colonialists who worked with the Cylons in various ways.  The episode is powerful and reflects the kind of long-term implications of war; creator Ronald Moore aptly compared this episode to the kinds of things seen in France after WWII, for example.  I'm always a sucker for the darker, more politically-tinged episodes of BSG, and this one really did it for me.

The season contains several stand-alone episodes that don't continue the main plotline of the search for Earth.  Some of these episodes work well, especially ""Dirty Hands,"" which considers the blue-collar workers who are toiling in the fleet under nearly impossible conditions.  Unfortunately, some of the stand-alones are less successful, particularly ""Hero"" and ""A Day in the Life.""  Overall, I was pleased with the directions in which they take the main characters, although I was disappointed that Duwalla's part continues to shrink and be less satisfying.  I also was not fond of the turn taken by Starbuck as she follows her ""destiny.""  I've never been a Starbuck fan, and I found this entire plotline irritating.  Hearing Ronald Moore give Katee Sackhoff constant tongue-baths on the dvd podcast commentaries just added to my irritation.  The woman does all her acting by curling her lips, clearing her throat, and making weird snorting giggles.  Please make her stop!  Ok, I feel better now.

Fortunately, the season ends with some very exciting episodes.  Foremost among them is the reveal of four of the final five Cylons.  As is typical of BSG, the season ends with some great cliffhangers that promise to take the series in intriguing new directions.  What I perhaps love most about BSG is its willingness to make changes rather than resting on its laurels.  The story is constantly driving forward and taking us to new places, which is sometimes uncomfortable but always thrilling.  For me, Season Three was better than Season 2.5 and about in par with Seasons 2.0 and 1.",1250985600,,2609,5.101415094339623
2804873,5,B000OY8NCE,"If you've seen Season Three already, you know what I'm talking about.

With the new rule of Baltar, almost everybody has decided to live on the planet.  The ships are still left in orbit in order to patrol and to just be there just in case.  There are certainly changes.  It's like going to a high school reunion: people are fatter, people are missing things they had before, people are married, people are pregnant...

Now, how do we know that choosing Baltar as the new president was a bad idea?  The Cylons invaded and occupied the planet and he was their very own puppet.  I bet those people wish they'd stuck with the Roslin-Adama administration.

We have a resistence planet-side while we have the ships regrouping in order to come back for a rescue mission.  This ships along with their crews are completely out of practice.  Amazingly, the chief slacker of all ships is ""Apollo,"" who got married and ended up getting fat and lazy.  He's like the poster boy for not getting married.  It's really pathetic.  We lost our adorably hot fly boy.

And like everything, out of every bad thing comes good things and bad things.  We get the release of the Cylon they've deemed as Sharon Agathon back into service in the fleet.  We've got people married and with kids, but there are a lot of casualties.  Ellen Tigh and Tigh's eye are among them.  We also see ""Starbuck"" deal with an additional emotional trauma when she gets the child she was brainwashed to think was hers taken away on return to the Galactica.

The fleet is able to free those on the planet and everyone returns back to their ships.  Roslin and Adama take over once again.  There are people, though, that are still suffering from what had happened over the last several months and the time since they returned back aboard.  We find out more pieces to how to get back to Earth and that there are five unknown Cylons.

2804913,2,B000OY8NCE,"I don't get how this is the same show.  Season 1 introduced a simple premise and added layers of complexity.  Season 2 took that premise, expanded upon, and introduced the war as a single thread, where little battles won here and there, and little bits of information seemingly turning the tide of the war.  In fact, these two seasons reminded me a Seven Samurai type series, where intelligence, tactics, strategy, and personal styles subtlety turn the tide of war. Those two seasons exceeded my wildest expectations.

Now, this is season 3.  Boy, the producers and writers really just dismissed the concept of the show and almost everything we invested in it.  Spoilers below.  Most of the things that made the show great are just tossed aside for pointless religious concepts or stand-alone shows that go nowhere.

You know how Boomer, the central figure of Cylone/human defining moments, the one that brought the whole humanity question involved?  Well, the writers basically said FRAK YOU and kind of dismissed her.  Uh, okay.

You know how the show barely showed the enemy, only letting us see the small details that mattered, giving enough to whet our appetites?  Well, FRAK YOU, now, whole plots revolve around it, and they're just a bunch of babbling idiots.  Uh, thanks

You know how they worked really hard to destroy a few enemy Baseships?  How they sacrificed an entire battleship to take two out?  Well, guess what?  They're like 40 of them, so that sacrifice was absolutely pointless.  Another Fraking insult.

You know this show defied conventional standards?  Well, the Frak you again.  The first 3 or 4 episodes are pretty much a shoot `em up action.  The last two episodes?  A trial, where, sticking with a stereotypical boringness, ends with a ""emotional compelling dialogue presented from the witness stand"".  You know, like every Fraking courtroom drama created.

You know who Tom Szerek fought long and hard, with campaigns and assassinations attempts to become president?  Well Frak your memory, you're suppose to forget that.  Szerek actually becomes president, and then just gives it up in a minute.  WTF?  Oh, then he gets power hungry later, in season 4, so it further insults your intelligence.

And the worst thing of all were the two virus episodes.  This is true jump the shark territory.  You know how the show tries to throw in little morality?  Well, they got really full of themselves and thought they could throw in immensely stupid ""moral questions"".  Basically, they can easily win the war by introducing a virus into the Cylons and end it all.  Well, the writers say Frak you to your intellect, and want you to conveniently forget that all the episodes before involved ""Cylon genocide"" (e.g. destroying a resurrection ship), and almost all the episodes afterwards are involve ""genocide"" (e.g. especially in season 4, with the destruction of the resurrection hub), but suddenly, these two episodes, ""Cylon genocide"" is bad.  Just lazy writing that really annoyed me.

And many of the shows were completely wasted.  Another Frak you to those who want continue the saga.  There was a whole show about a doctor who intentionally kills random people from one planet, and other episodes where Baltar mumbles into bed with two female Cylons.

This season by itself was bad, but that it took a great show down with it just kills me.  With the exception of about a half hour of good, informational material, this entire season could actual be dismissed and Battlestar Galactica would be better.",1234742400,13,3524,4.955555555555556

This season had a great mix of everything, the overall story arc remained interesting and strong but also there was a great deal of tangents taken to tell stories about how the characters are handling life in such an intense situation. I really don't want to mention specifics and spoil anything, but these stories took a look at a different perspective of what life would really be like. These were purely character driven stories, adding so much depth to these characters and what life would really be like in a situation like this. I absolutely LOVED these stories and I don't think I have ever seen anything like them. They were clever, well written and inspiring and really, that is what I love and look for in stories.

Maybe some people would find these episodes boring, because they don't advance the main story arc forward (though there are plenty of episodes that do that and they are great as well), but if you like this show for more than the main story arc, and you are interested in the characters and their regular lives and struggles and triumphs outside of simply surviving as well, I think you'll love this season.",1233273600,,1329,4.533333333333333

It reminded me of a quality STAR TREK TNG episode that really made you think. It was great. And then other than those 2 or, possibly 3 stand alones, everything is moving forward great.

2804990,3,B000OY8NCE,"I consider this show to have had great potential. The special effects are great. Everything has the look and feel of a gritty ship, a collection of people on the run in spaceships. And the acting and dialog is very good, believable most of the time. This season suffers from several flaws that knock it down from fantastic to merely ordinary.

First and foremost, the lack of any heroes. I'm not sure there are any characters in the show I have much affection for. Starbuck was annoying from day one. When she was written out of the show (I assume she's probably back in season four, but I don't have cable, so that will have to wait), I was happy that I'd get a break from her for at least a few episodes. There is hardly any joy on Galactica, and little reason for any. They're going to all connive and bicker and backstab and frak and booze their way back to Earth, apparently. Just when I start liking any of the characters, they go off and do something half-cocked or mean or stupid or selfish, and I return to ambivalence or outright hatred for them.

In season three, there are too many (one would be too many) soap opera-ish episodes focusing on the sordid personal affairs and traumas of the sordid characters. As a result, finding the way to Earth and trying to understand what the Cylons are playing at -- the main plot arcs -- get cheated. In other words, they do a lot of treading water.

Visually, the frequent use of handheld cameras that bounce around -- the field of view veering off left, right, up, down, jerking, jiggling constantly -- is irritating. If one were watching this on a big screen it could induce motion sickness. I can't remember the first season's visuals, but I'm sure this criticism applies to season two as well. If you've made it this far into the series, you've gotten used to it. It still can be an annoyance.

But for all that, the show has its moments. Some of the courtroom scenes in the trial of The Great Weasel Baltar are particularly effective. The first few episodes telling of the escape from slavery to the Cylons on New Caprica are almost worthy of a motion picture. These successes make the weakness of the episodes in between all the more glaring.

I'm looking at season three as something I had to mostly wade through to get to what will hopefully be an impressive conclusion to the big mysteries they've developed in the series.",1213228800,5,2383,4.506944444444445
2804991,5,B000OY8NCE,"I am a huge fan and Season Three does NOT disappoint. The story line is excellent, the characters continue to evolve and I continue to be totally hooked.  People that have watched from the beginning know all of this, but I discovered Battlestar Galactica much later.  I don't watch much TV and haven't been into science fiction since I was a kid.  My introduction to the series came from Battlestar Galactica writer/producer David Weddle, who is a friend of mine.  He invited me to a screening one day and after that I ordered Season 1 and I have been addicted ever since.

This season introduced the idea that Balter should be tried for his crimes, which I thought Crossroads one and two did a good job of conveying his emotions as well as everyone elses. It is also worth noting that towards the end of the season most of the unknown cylons had been revealed. This added a new piece to the puzzle and changed the ball game.

2805017,4,B000OY8NCE,"At first, many were quite skeptical about the idea of reviving the old ""Battlestar Galactica"" show and updating it quite heavily though now critics and tv watchers agree it's one of the best shows on TV. But even the most critically acclaimed television shows can hit rough patches and most would say Season 3 of the show was arguably its less ""perfect"". While there was some stellar episodes and twists, there was also a bit of meandering and episodes that are interesting but don't really add much to anything. The beginning of the season was some of its most interesting and the finale wasn't as massive and grand but it ended the show on a good note; it's just the middle that wasn't quite up to snuff.

At the end of season 2, the show surprised everyone by jumping forward a year and having the settlement on New Caprica taken over by the Cylons. Season 3 takes place a good length of time into the occupation as characters are all over the place emotionally and having to take on different roles. After escaping (in one of the most exciting action sequences the show's ever done), we follow the crew as they try to find Earth and we learn more about the Cylons and their plans.

The opening set of episodes were quite compelling as character lives were essentially reset and given a different form than what we saw on the ship. Chief Tyrol was now head of a union, President Roslin was a schoolteacher and Anders and Tigh are resistance fighters trying to wear down the Cylon force. The end couple of episodes follows a surprising character death and a trial that takes up the majority of the finale. These bits are just as intriguing as any of the episodes from the previous 2 seasons and with some great character moments and episodes that feature characters almost exclusively, it makes for a good well-rounded experience.

It's the middle section that kind of drags though there's nothing inherently wrong with it. Some are just uninvolving while others, such as Helo's dilemma with a doctor or Tyrol's troubles involving a factory are good episodes but they don't really register on the grand scale of the whole season, they were just good. The mid-season break off point where we get another clue to Earth's whereabouts is great but season 3 feels more like it drags its feet a bit, managing to make it to the season finale but not building tension and pace but just offering episodes to tide you over till they end it. It's kind of similar to the first batch of episodes from season 3 of ""Lost"" which had good episodes but when you hit the next set, there's a sharp notice in quality.

With the special features available and the podcast commentaries present on practically every episode, season 3 is of course going to be a pick-up for fans of the show. But like most shows, there will be their stellar years while others are just good. Season 3 is a watch sure, but only chunks of it being exceptional.",1212451200,3,2918,4.595009596928983

Well acted, especially at the ends of the season, BSG continues to shine in Season 3.  The middle gets a little heavy, too much emotional baggage for some.  But, it can't be All Starship Combat, All the Time!  The characters, even those who are Cylons, are flawed, human, and very relatable.

With the Cylon occupation in full force and the pressure being on for the colonists of New Caprica and the President Gaius Baltar.  Fans of the show before won't be disappointed with plenty of action between the various characters and the Cylons (them having their issues themselves).

The Cylons attempt to make peace with the colonists by starting up a police force made up of colonists of New Caprica.  It just insights the rebels as many view the new police as traitors conspiring with the Cylons.

More background of the characters are revealed and the tensions are flaring over Baltar's impending trial for crimes against the colonists that will seperate people and thrust them onto opposing sides with varying views on death being the penalty and others wanting the justice system to actually do what it should do.

2805035,5,B000OY8NCE,"I am a big fan of this show. I actually only started watching it from the DVDs in 2007. Seasons 1 and 2 provided some of the best and smartest television that I've ever experienced, and season 3 continues that tradition.

If you've already watched seasons 1 and 2, I don't think there's anything that I can say here that will make you want to watch season 3 more than what you've already watched so far. Maybe you're here looking for reassurance that this season won't disappoint. I'll tell you this, I went through it in less than a week, 3 and sometimes 4 episodes at a time.

If you haven't seen seasons 1 and 2, then you shouldn't start with this season because this show has one story that started with the very first few minutes of the pilot mini-series and is still yet to fully unfold and reveal itself in the final fourth season.

Compared to seasons 1 and 2, season 3 falls a little slow in a few of the episodes in the middle, but the beginning and end of it is in my opinion stronger and more exciting.

You learn a lot about some characters in this season. Some characters die, while others undergo major events that alter their lives forever.

The finale of this season is the best so far in the series.

p.s. The 10-minute each ""Resistance"" webisodes should be watched first, but they are in the bonus features section on Disc 2.",1211068800,,1344,4.377510040160643

2805037,4,B000OY8NCE,"Season three for BSG is a bit disappointing. The old formula was dispensed with, and replaced with an ""anthology"" format. While this format worked (and worked well) for series such as ""The Twilight Zone"" (old and new), ""Doctor Who"" (old and new), ""The Outer Limits"" (old and new) as well as ""The X-Files"", it just didn't make one feel as though there was an unbridled passion to WANT TO see the next episode, as seasons one and two did. The stories stayed true to moving toward Earth, but seemed disconnected by needlessly examining the personal stories of people we ALREADY know. In defense of season three, the last three episodes were definitely nail-biters!

I am HUGE fan of this series, and season three is in my library. Season four appears to have returned to the ""old"" formula, once again, because Earth Looms distant on the horizon, but three will be known as the one season that just couldn't close the distance.",1210982400,,923,4.732919254658385

I don't usually collect TV series but I own every BSG episode (including the fill-in Razor) through season 3 and can hardly wait for Season Four to be available.

This included every episode but the very last one in which I felt they really went in a strange direction revealing too much too quickly. In any case the writers are going to have to work overtime to make this make sense and have some sort of realistic contiguity about the show.

In any case it is still worth viewing and depending on how the next season pans out it could really go either way. I really hope it does for the better because this show has really been a ground breaker as far as night time TV dramas go.",1209686400,,569,4.126126126126126

2805077,4,B000OY8NCE,"Logic?  Who needs logic?  The entire human population is now the size of a  very small town, about 1/3 the population of Peoria, Illinois.  They are at war, on the run, with few resources.  And so. . . a dozen ""reporters"" cover every ""press conference"" given by the ""president.""

Or. . . the Cylons capture most of the human population, and decide to try to help the humans instead of hurt them.  But the Cylons don't bother to increase the food rations, or provide equipment for industry, or do anything that would make life better for the humans on a miserable little planet.  Why?  Who knows?

Then there's the clumsy and illogical politics.  The little town, so much smaller than Peoria, fights the Cylons by turning to. . . suicide bombing!  The first suicide bombings in the universe not motivated by religious hatred and promise of a sweet aferlife!

The amazing part is that the logical gaps and silly political statements don't interfere with the fun.  The look and feel of the future has that gritty Blade Runner quality that draws you in.  Captain Adama is just wonderful with his pock marked face, deadpan expressions, and understated authority and frustrations.  (But, boy, his son Lee sure gets annoying this year.  He reminds me of a youngish Al Gore, only less endearing).  And the interplay between Baltar and the Cylon in his head continues to provide many of the best scenes.

All in all, a guilty addiction.  Looking forward to next season.",1209427200,,1460,4.741035856573705

2805079,4,B000OY8NCE,"I was a casual viewer of season three during its run and was initially turned off by the New Caprica occupation story line. I'll admit that because of my schedule and the late time slot at 10 Friday's it was difficult for me to stay in tune with the series. Seeing it on my own schedule and sans commercials, however, gives me a renewed interest in the story line and a greater appreciation for the direction the writer's chose. The characters seem fully fleshed out and -- if possible -- even more complex, and I never tire of the gritty style of the photography with its unsaturated color, high contrast and use of a hand held camera. I especially like the choice to give even the space scenes a hand held look, which suggests there is a person out there behind the camera; a weird dynamic to be sure! I am quickly becoming a big fan of season three. I would recommend, however, they redo the packaging similar to the recent release of the more affordable SG-1 series and incorporate 2 discs to a sleeve.

2805080,5,B000OY8NCE,"Third season of BSG still gets a 5/5 from me, although it seems kinda slower than first two seasons. There is no big bundle of plot twists in the middle of it like with the previous two. Season one had Starbuck journey - Adama crisis, season two had the Pegasus. All three events radically changed the rest of their respective seasons probably preventing them from getting stale.
There was really no big surprise and no breakthrough in the third season until the very last episode. Because we already knew they were going to rescue people from NC pretty soon into the season; and the verdict in the trial was also kind of predictable.

I don't like how technically bad the episode commentaries had become, instead of doing a good quality dedicated commentaries for DVD set they use ""pod-casts"" again. Overwhelming majority of commentaries are done by RDMoore alone talking through what seems to be a long metal pipe with a mike glued to the other end. Additionally, I don't get why do they feel it's better to completely TURN OFF the sound from actual movie during the commentary. Is it supposed to feel like commenting on a silent movies, like a retro or something?!

The ""tradition"" of showing key moments from current episode after the beginning sequence AND BEFORE THE VERY EPISODE AIRS has gotten very old and unnecessary.

2805083,5,B000OY8NCE,"If you're considering this product, there's a high probability that you, like myself, are a true die-hard fan of intelligent Sci-Fi. Almost all of televisions offerings... well frankly Big budget movies as well, are low brow, dumbed down and often down right silly creations for the sci-fi audience. Most are direct to video bombs starring such revered actors as Lorenzo Lamas or dubbed with such imaginative titles as 'Mansquito'. Most t.v. Shows or made for t.v. movies are rip offs of other High budget movie releases. Point being, The 'industry' dosen't take it's sci-fi fans seriously.
But Not so with Battlestar Galactica. Although every episode may not be the space battles we all get the biggest kick out of, they are all well written, well portrayed and interesting looks into the lives of a people on the run for years now and how they cope. BSG is by far the best sci-fi series to ever grace the small screen and some, myself included, count it amoung the best dramas ever as well. It satisfies every part of the package that makes a great story that just HAppens to have a sci-fi theme. Its amazing to think it was spawned from the original series which Even as a kid I thought was bad. This new BSG does everything right. Everything. It's smart. It's dark but hopeful. It's exciting and often full of suspense. It's characters are interesting and deep and well developed. And, though we sometimes don't like to see it, it's not afraid to kill off characters we are familiar with or have grown to love.
  BSG brought me back to television. It is the only show in years that I truley look forward to seeing each week. You may not know me from Adam, but lemme tell ya. I am often told I am too critical of movies or shows because alot things don't 'work' in them. All to often the 'universe' a story is set in has conflicting rules for it's characters. Which makes the whole thing unbelievable. Which my non-sci-fi fan friends claim is a oxymoron since sci-fi or fantasy in general is 'unbelievable'. But to us fans of the genre, as long as the storyteller follows his own rules for that universe, ANYTHING is believable. BSG is real and true to it's universe. It is consistant and believable in every sense.  And that is why it's fans are among the most loyal and dedicated of any series on TV today.
  It doesnt have the fantasy elements of alot of other sci-fi offerings. You have the humans on the run, their cylon creations in pursuit and some meta-physical bond between them driving them both towards a common destiny.
  That's my 2 cents worth of fanboi opinion. My only suggestion is, if you're new to the series. Start at the beginning with the miniseries. The show relies heavily on previous episodes to continue the story.
Enjoy this jewel. It ends soon.",1209340800,,2775,4.616632860040568
2805084,5,B000OY8NCE,"Season Three of Battlestar Galactica is its best and most consistent season yet. The first season was excellent but was still setting the show up; the second season had some fantastic episodes but a few that didn't quite make it; but the third season is good from beginning to end.

The plot thickens considerably, and even the ""stand-alone"" episodes in the second half are engaging and well-made. Some people watch to find out what happens next, so episodes like ""The Woman King"", ""Unfinished Business"", or ""Dirty Hands"" won't satisfy them, but each of these episodes develops the characters and the situations they face beyond the scope of a typical science fiction show. The realism of the setting is one of the show's strengths, and it can be felt in every episode. ""Unfinished Business"", an atypical story with no jeopardy and no Cylons, consisting of flashbacks to the failed New Caprica colony intercut with an informal boxing match in the hangar deck, is my favorite episode of the series; even better in its extended version.

The acting is, as usual, exceptional. Jamie Bamber and James Callis especially deserve credit; Jamie Bamber carries the final three shows of the season and delivers a climactic court-room speech in the finale, which sees Dr. Baltar on trial for treason. Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell start showing off darker sides, proving their characters are willing to resort to desperate measures -- biological warfare, summary executions -- to keep the human race alive. And the Cylons become much more complex and human over the course of the season, helped along by Lucy Lawless and Dean Stockwell in supporting roles. Mark Shepherd -- who genre fans might recognize from ""Firefly"" -- steals scenes as an eccentric defense attorney in the finale.

The show's special effects have always been extraordinary, and this season has some of the most spectacular shots yet - the Galactica jumping into and out of a planet's atmosphere, a supernova, several gorgeous nebulae, and all the shots of Vipers and Cylon centurions we've come to expect. It's a visual treat. The crowning moment is probably the final shot of the season, pulling back from Galactica and the fleet, and ending up with an extreme zoom on faraway Earth.

The ending is a very serious cliffhanger that raises almost unbearable expectations for Season Four. The DVD also contains Ron Moore's informative and entertaining commentaries, and some rather silly video blogs from producer David Eick; also an extended version of ""Unfinished Business"", the only episode so far to revolve entirely around its characters without placing the ship or the fleet in jeopardy.",1209254400,,2659,5.077803203661327

In spite of this, if you loved Seasons 1 and 2, then 3 is well worth the price.  At the very least, go out and rent it just so that you can see the humans escape from New Caprica.

The main storyline(s) continue strong, and the central idea of a race brought slightly closer together due to devastation but still prey to the same old human failings has lost none of its life.  Before diving into this set I heard so much about the proliferation of dreaded ""stand-alone"" episodes that do nothing but mark time.  I kept waiting for this massive infestation to occur, but by my count, said episodes number four...four out of a total of twenty.  And IMO two of them are quite good (especially the one about the development of the union, a long-overdue topic) - the other two are comparatively so-so but far from horrible,  and I didn't  mind a bit of breathing room from the forward thrust of the main tale - I like the world they've created enough to enjoy roaming around in its further corners, and having a little break from the often-present tension is a welcome relief sometimes.

But yes, there were far too many episodes in the middle where they decided to make it more of a ""human"" drama and got bogged down in things like unions, domestic disputes and other claustrophobic episodes where not much action takes place (although I did like the boxing episode).

And of course there's the shocker episode with Starbuck (no spoilers).

Not sure if you needed a trial at the end and not sure that they needed to make Baltar so pathetic and unlikeable.  But they almost pull it all out with a classic Galactica nail-biting, definition-of-cliffhanger final episode, which was an adrenaline shot.  The temple episode was classic as well--a perfect mix of action, story and mysticism that ranks up there with the best episodes.

Battlestar Galactica Season 3 [BSG3], for those unfamiliar with BSG in general or struggling to categorize it, is what i consider true science fiction.

Science Fiction by definition is fiction based on reality. The reality being science and what we know to be true in the universe.

Succesful science fiction are those that allow the observer/viewer to side-step our reality and look right back at it.  The ""fun"" part or the creative part of sci-fi is HOW they side-step you and allow you to look back. Side-stepping...looking back through a lense...all can be called a mechanism.

BSG succeeds perfectly with its mechanism and through it we are provided  points of view of our REALITY that we probably would never ever have seen or imagined.  And what are these points of views about? Politics... religous views... philosophy... gloss packaged definitions of freedom, terrorism...humanity...war... existentialism...morality...

Morality.  That, for those of you wondering where my review of this particular season is in this whole text, is on of the underlying themes of the season.  It has existed in other seasons just as the other themes also exist in season 3...but in season 3 morality takes the driver's seat.

You will surprise yourself first by realizing that you've seen the other side of a particular issue [that is basically an analogy for a reality based equivalent]...then find yourself perplexed as to what your stance is on this.

""I thought my stance has always been 'no' to this or that...but now I'm not so sure""

""When you look at it from this side...from the side you have been cheering on the whole time...it doesnt ...seem so bad...?""

You will thoroughly enjoy going through that and I believe it is a credit to the BSG team that they have DESIGNED something that can exctract such reaction and thought...or more clearly, that they have designed somethign that can extract such SPECIFIC  reactions and thoughts from you by design.

Things get darker in season 3 and perhaps appropriately so if it is to be based on whats happening in our world.  You wil hear many reviews about it being dark and heavy, but if you want the real deal this is it.  Keep in mind that as with reality, as dark as thigns may seem, it only fuels it's opposite: hope.  Hope may be another major underlying theme that everyone has missed on when reviewing BSG 3.  It is there in a big way and you don't realize it until someone points it out to you.  That is the one spoiler i may have provided and its not a plot spoiler but an experience-spoiler.

Watch and you will understand how it makes you take that side step and allows you to look back at real life, through the BSG mechanism, from a different perspective on everything you have believed in.

BSG is not nerdy. It is real.  This sci-fi is more real than reality based shows! ""Princesses"" may not be rescued in the end. They may all live ""happily ever after"" but at what expense?  ...and... might your understanding of what ""happily ever after"" is change in the first place by the time they end their journey next season?

For those of you that have been watching BSG from the beginning: continue although i bet i don't have to tell you that.

For those that are new to the experience: start from the beginning. pick it up, watch the fireworks, then free your mind.",1208736000,,3339,4.731833910034602

She is showing the same symptoms of fundamentalist elitism as ""W"".  I'm expecting her to walk on the bridge of Galactica and announce that she's the ""decider"".

Basic Jr. College Anthropology has shown that when 2 cultures come together the first thing that happens is a lot of hatred and fighting (the humans vs. cylons).  Next comes a blending where they begin to need each other and lastly is a merger where they share a manifest destiny and work together towards this goal.

2805112,2,B000OY8NCE,"I loved the initial mini-series and most of the first two seasons (although the second half of the second season had a few clinkers). The first four episodes of the third season, as the New Caprica story arc from the second season was completed, were also very good.  Then the series fell apart.  The amount of action dropped sharply, with whole episodes going by without any sign of the Cylons.  Instead we were treated to soap opera.  Most episodes involved exploring the emotional state of one or more characters.  There were endless arguments and emotional outbursts and lots and lots of crying.  Adama cries, Laura cries, Lee cries, Starbuck cries, Adama cries some more, Laura cries some more, and on and on and on.  The plot of the series is hardly advanced at all.  You could skip from episode four to the last episode and have missed very little.  What happened?  I have three theories:

1.  The executive producers ran our of ideas and just filmed whatever scripts were handed in to complete their obligations to Universal.
2.  The budget was cut so that special effects had to be kept to a bare minimum.
3.  They decided to refocus the series to appeal to new -- read ""women"" -- viewers.

I'm inclined to think that 1. is the correct theory.  The producers had some good ideas about how this series could be ""reimagined,"" but they blew through them in the first two seasons, leaving very little to fall back on in season three.  If their objective was 3., then they might have considered that the intersection of the people attracted by the action-oriented sci-fi of the first two seasons and the people attracted by the soap opera of the third season is probably the null set.

Unfortunately, the first episodes of the fourth season are, if anything, worse than the third season.  The best we can hope for now is that they have an interesing finale waiting if we can just last through the rest of this season.",1208563200,20,1921,4.6301775147929

2805137,3,B000OY8NCE,"Lots of well-written reviews here that I basically agree with.  Summary:  the middle of Season 3 seemed to lose focus after a brilliant and intense beginning.  Things finished up pretty nicely, though.

The culprit, I think, is that Ron Moore and the other writers simply had too many story ideas to properly address in a single season of episodic television.  All of the mid-season standalone episodes, ""A Day in the Life"", ""Hero,"" and the show with the strike on the refinery ship, featured interesting ideas that weren't adequately developed.  Lots of cool ideas:  ethnic tension, the fate of exhausted and demoralized civilians, decaying ships and supplies, sinister actions by the Colonial government during the Armistice.  But all squeezed into too few hours of time and not developed.

Despite all that, I got a lot more out of watching S3 back-to-back on DVD than I did when it aired.  In watching back-to-back, you see just how much story continuity really did exist over the entire season, and how far it actually did move the overall BSG tale.  Oh, and the extended version of the infamous ""boxing ring"" episode?  The new footage adds a lot, but then I also liked that episode on first viewing, too.

2805139,5,B000OY8NCE,"I thought the New Caprica plot point was a poor departure from the bulk of the first two seasons, particularly because during the last 30 minutes of the last episode of season two a whole year had passed, which was as long or longer as the entire length of the series. But season three has atoned for this error by providing some interesting issues posed by the colonization, and, by granting the producers some leeway in how the colonists escaped New Caprica, the quality is as high or higher than the prior to seasons.",1208476800,,520,4.542553191489362

2805144,5,B000OY8NCE,"It's high drama in space. Even if you don't like Sci-Fi, you'll like this show. Season 3 starts off very strong. There are some weak points near the middle. For instance, I thought that Admiral Adama and Prez Roslin got more than a little unreasonable and out of character in the episode ""Dirty Hands"". As a viewer you find yourself drifting out of the story and thinking about how the writers are manipulating you into emotional frustration since the behavior of the characters gets a bit too unrealistic.

Drama this dramatic opens the door for comedy sketch writers, but so far they either haven't recognized how well the table has been set before them, or they don't dare touch something that so many people take so seriously. For example, we seem to be watching Adama shave his face far too often and one more outbreak of ""So say we all!"" will likely lead me to discover if I can skewer myself with a piece of common kitchen cutlery before I asphyxiate on my own vomit.

Regardless of any nit-picking and fault-finding, BSG is still head & shoulders above anything else on TV and it would appear that the best has been saved 'til last.",1208217600,,1140,4.583333333333333

Oh ... one more thing. I bought seasons one and two (the latter of which was is two parts) in stores. I got season three here on Amazon ... BRAND NEW ... and saved about 25% over what I woulda paid at Best Buy. That's no BS people.",1208217600,,466,4.131868131868132
2805147,5,B000OY8NCE,"What sets BATTLESTAR GALACTICA apart from other sci-fi series on TV lately is the unashamed ambition. Just as LAW AND ORDER claims to rip off its stories from the headlines, the Peabody-Award-winner Sci-Fi channel series has set its roots firmly in the most urgent issues from the real world. The difference here being in scope - LAW AND ORDER picks private hells; BSG goes global.
If second season had real politics all over it, this third season at long last released on DVD is about terrorism and idealism, faith and fanatism, the community and the individual. As seen in the cliffhanger from season 2, the human race finds an Earth-like safe haven after having their worlds destroyed by the Cylons, the monogamist androids who devote their cyberlife to the destruction of their infidel creator, man itself. The problem is Cylons have found it, too. Gaius Baltar, the man who inadvertently helped to seal mankind's doom, is the puppet president of this New Caprica. He tries to survive between his repressive masters and the conspiratorial human mob. The old feud has become guerrilla warfare.
It's the perfect setup for treason, torture, self-discovery and sacrifice. And because the series creators don't stretch the storyline too much, matters are solved way before mid-season. The aftermath is as painful.
Althoiugh some of the subsequent episodes, such as THE WOMAN KING, lack the punch of the dramatic beginning, puzzling pieces are presented little by little as a build-up for the final season. Characters will die, status quos will be changed, allegiances will be challenged, and a Bob Dylan song will be given a whole new perspective.
As usual, the 6-disc box is a treat. No wonder the series ratings have been on a descent - viewers prefer to wait for the DVD release and get the full picture: deleted scenes, expanded episodes, mini-webisodes, behind-the-scenes docs, and the insightful podcast commentaries by creator Ronald D. Moore (STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION). BSG DVDs are a hit both in the US and overseas.
For those who don't know, it's a good opportunity to jump in. Recaps are easy to follow and they might tease you to watch the previous seasons. For the die-hard fans, it's a new chance to wonder why the Emmys have systematically neglected this show. Maybe reality bites too deep.",1208131200,,2310,4.987046632124352
2805148,5,B000OY8NCE,"The makers of Battlestar Galactica (BSG), who not only proved they had a big enough brass pair to offer up a challenge to Star Wars and Star Trek, but delivered on one of the most memorable Seasons in TV history with BSG season 2, blast this show off beyond the stars with Season 3. Fraking mind-blowing television like this has never been so good, offering some of the best SF since Khan tried to get his vengeance on Kirk and Yoda pulled out a lightsaber.

BSG is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous BSG series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.

The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill humans of the twelve colonies across the galaxy.

BSG season 3 is about escaping from the occupied Cylon colony concentration camp and exposing the remaining `Cylons 5'. Collaborators are uncovered and dealt with. The Cylon social life is explored more deeply as is the interior workings of their basestars. A new threat against the Cylons emerges. Long lost soldiers turn up. Crew dissension threatens the Galactica. More prophecy is unveiled, a leading cast member dies, Baltar goes on trial for treason and some of the final Cylons are revealed.

Season 3 takes place mainly on New Caprica but is soon back on the deck of the Galactica, but also on Colonial One (the President's cruise ship) and the inside of a basestar. There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) maintains his position as one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) as the President goes through some radical character dilemmas as does Starbuck, a woman in this version of BSG, whose background love relationships are as important as her action-woman persona. Commander/Major/Civilian Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) ascends up the ranks and descends them like a yoyo. Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) finds himself in an impasse between himself and the Cylons. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) may revolt. Colonel Saul Tigh's (Michael Hogan) relationship with his wife turns nasty. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) may prove that Cylons can co-exist with humans. This is but a small section of the interesting storylines and enormous cast that BSG has to offer... and yes important characters do die, so its edge of your seat stuff through and through.

The CGI is up there with the best ILM can put out. If you thought Season 2 pushed the boundaries then Season 3 is that multiplied by 10. One scene even sees the Galactica enter an atmosphere for an amazing launch sequence. The real stars of the show are the screenwriters. It is their boat and they are taking us on what appears to be a voyage unparallel to anything else you have seen before.

BSG Season 3 keeps up the post-9/11 brain candy. The writers sometimes jab at the Bush administration foreign and war policies and then again seem to back them up. In Season 1 it was about the constant search for fossil fuels and battling for control of resources while freedoms get restricted in the fight against terrorism, modelling our own political struggles. In Season 2 its politics coupled with colonization. Season 3 is about concentration camps and the lengths people will go to for freedom including having none.

The interesting religious confrontation involving polytheism (the human belief system in BSG) and monotheism (the Cylon belief system) is extended more. Even some Cylons are becoming addicted to their death sequences. Prophecy starts to come to life.

Season 3 is mostly about escaping the concentration camp and discovering the final 5. If you are a fan of SF or just high-quality television, then nothing should be holding you back. BSG could very well be the most important SF TV since Star Trek. It certainly has propelled itself out of this world and is in a dimension all of its own... except when Cylons appear. Oh and did we forget to mention that TV doesn't get much better than this? It is worth saying that more than once.

It is a bit more character focused and has fewer battles, which means the tension is more internal to the characters. The season is filled with a lot of difficult choices and ethical dilemas but this in no way becames too dramatic or over the top and the show never looses sight of the overarching story. We do get a bigger glimpse into the inner workings of the Cylons and of course the season ends with not one but two gigantic plost twists. The set includes lots of deleted scenes which become obvious as to why they were deleted. And there are a few behind the scenes interviews etc. which are always fun.",1207699200,,715,4.383458646616542
2805167,3,B000OY8NCE,"Both the 5 stars and the 1 star reviews hit on the truth at some points. Depending on what you love or despise about TV, you'll either love or hate BSG Season 3. The gratuitous T&A is somewhat scaled back, though the scenes are simply shot with clothes on now.

Season 3 opens up after the end of Season 2, virtually a few weeks after the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. The first portion of the series covers the resistance against the Cylons and the incredible stress put on both the people on the ground and the members of the Fleet who are planning their rescue.

The Cylons obviously play a much more prominent role in this season, rather than Virtual Six being the sole member of the Cylons present. After the escape from New Caprica, the show does by degrees slow to a crawl, though several episodes are well made and do illsutrate the incredible tension being placed on the survivors of the occupation. The scenes involving Gaius Baltar being held prisoner on a Cylon Baseship are very well done for how surreal they are, and for Baltars near descent into madness due to psychological stress and torture. The season ends up spectacularly with the trial of Gaius for treason against the Colonies, and while a little overdone, is still impressive for how passionate it is.

All told, Season 3 is simply moving pieces around the board, and while the plot is moved forward, a large portion of the season is designated for backstory and stock storylines.",1207699200,,1458,4.6434108527131785
2805168,5,B000OY8NCE,"If you've watched the first two seasons of this excellent series, your expectations have probably been set high for this, the third season.  Battlestar Galactica, Season Three does not disappoint.  The first several episodes are arguably the finest of the series, and the season ends with an amazing cliffhanger that should not be missed.

Be sure to watch the series in order:  start with the Miniseries (which is both sold seperately and included with the Season One boxed set), and continue through in order.",1207699200,,511,5.0476190476190474

2805170,1,B000OY8NCE,"Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews. This show is not ""ground-breaking"", or ""the best show on television"" or whatever. Its a caricature of a sci-fi show, in that its basically a soap opera in space. BSG even gets covered in Soap Opera digest, that's how far gone it is from the realm of sci-fi

All of the characters behave non-sensically, no plot issue is ever resolved, any time anyone is getting along they have a fight for no reason, just to keep everyone at each other's throats all the time, and the writers routinely contradict themselves in every single episode

Starbuck is not only the best fighter pilot ever, but the best sniper ever, the best hand to hand fighter ever, she can time travel, Cylons love her, she is the only one who can find Earth, and any man on the show would give his right arm to sleep with her, and she's a great painter? What can't she do? Nothing comes to mind

One episode you have a guy point his fire arm at his commanding officer, mutiny, refuse direct orders and demand to have his way, then 10 minutes later everyone has forgotten about it, and the next week THAT SAME GUY is doing something he doesn't want to do, something he knows will lead to disaster, because ""orders are orders""?

There's all of 10 main characters left on the show, and as of this writing there are maybe 5 of them who haven't been revealed to be Cylons. Kind of makes you wonder why they're bothering to continue the war on humanity when every single human leader is a Cylon, but I don't guess the show was meant to be scrutinized that closely

BSG is an insult to its viewers, and has much more in common with Desperate Housewives or Dirt than it does with the X-Files, the original BSG, Star Wars, Star Trek, or any other sci-fi show I can think of. Which is fine if that's what you want, but they don't market it as the kind of show it is, that's what I'm saying

I will say the mini-series was pretty good, and the first season wasn't bad, but in season 2 this show went off the rails big time and by season 3 it was just a complete joke. Do yourself a favor and don't ever get started on it unless you just love lots of pointless screaming and soft core sex scenes that stop and start at random times",1207612800,25,2229,4.295238095238095

2805172,5,B000OY8NCE,"This is the best season so far of a stellar show.  Seasons 1 and 2 were both great, but season 3 goes the extra mile because the writers showed complete fearlessness by letting it get dark.  The bleak sensibility is endemic to the series' circumstances; what we have here is pure existentialism.  What hooked me into Battlestar from the beginning was not just obviously the amazing mini-series, but moreover its ending, when Admiral Adama admits privately that though he's just given a speech to the entire remaining human race about how they're now heading for Earth, he has no idea where Earth is.  This season goes beyond the tit-for-tat space battles with the cylons, which I do love.  The creators had the courage to dig down deep into the premise, to deal with life on board these ships, both human and cylon.  I love that we spend time on board the cylon bay ships, that we see the human class differences and basic social structure perpetuating from the colonies, that we really get the feeling of not just hopelessness that was present in season 2, but of resolve.  Most television programs turn away from that kind of darkness/depth and retreat when confronted with the prospect of boring down into the most organic inner recesses of a given premise.  That retreat is often referred to as ""jumping the shark"".  The creators of this new Battlestar series are crafting Sartre-esque literature.",1207526400,,1401,4.828451882845188

I enjoy a wide range of shows and certainly would not limit myself to action, and I say that so that when I say this season was so boring I had to force myself to finish the DVDs people will not assume it was just because the action went down.  I stopped caring about most of the characters, they just started to really seem lame.  I think there are now, because of the fairly predictable cliffhanger (spoiler - nearly every major character is a cylon), some serious continuity problems in the show.  The so called cylon plan is so long and so complicated that it will take a rather inventive final season to plug all the plot holes.

Enter Season 3.  The first episode was just perfectly made and acted.  It felt like a completely different show.  This season's four-part opener is some of the best TV out there, especially the magnificent ""Exodus Part II"".  The show continued with such excellent episodes as ""Collaborators"" and ""Hero"".  The first half of the season ended with the jaw-dropping ""The Eye Of Jupiter"".  The second half of the season was slightly weaker then the first half, but still had great episodes such as ""Maelstrom"" and ""Crossroads Part II"".

2805190,5,B000OY8NCE,"I didn't think it was possible to match or improve on the previous seasons of this fearless series, but then I watched season 3 on DVD.
What's best about this show is that the writers and producers are not afraid to take on the tough issues of our times and reflect them back to us through the characters and storylines on BSG.
This time, we follow several characters on story arcs which alter their lives forever.  There's Lee Adama and wife Dee, whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace.  Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter, abusive mother.  Lee's complicated relationship with his father, William, is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar's trial.  In the meantime, Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife, Ellen, and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues.  The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar, to a degree, and then perjures himself on the witness stand.  And the Cylons themselves show us more faces, more personality, and more of a purpose than they ever have before.  Lastly, Agathon and Athena must deal with the fact that she's a Cylon and their baby daughter is a hybrid.  I hope that more will be done with this in the last season.",1207180800,,1338,4.688034188034188

I think Season 3 had some lagging parts in the middle --as if they budgeted all their money for the terrifically insane first 4 episodes and then those killer episodes near the end-- but didn't leave much for in between. However, even ""lagging"" BSG episodes blow most TV shows out of the water.

This series is easily one of the best currently on TV (now that The Wire is finished--I'd wager it *is* the best).

2805192,3,B000OY8NCE,"Consistently the best thing about the ongoing BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series has been in its intellectual ambitions. While its predecessor and namesake, the Glen Larson series from the late 1970s, was largely a space opera, this series is actually a study in war, and attempts to cover such difficult ethical problems as loyalty, violence, torture, religion and class in a war-torn society (except this happens to be a society in outer space). But you often find yourself applauding the series more for its intentions than for its execution, particularly in this, its third season.

Season 2 ended extremely thrillingly with a leap forward in time of a year in the final episode when the fugitive fleet, after settling on an Earth-like planet, found themselves invaded and conquered by their Cylon nemeses. This season begins four months after that during the ongoing Cylon occupation; although the show's creators remark repeatedly on their pride concerning these first four episodes (which involve the humans having to escape the Cylons yet again) in their somewhat gaseous podcast commentaries provided as extras on their DVDs, these actually some of the least enjoyable and least original episodes of the series so far. The creators of the show seem to have tried too hard to push for contemporary analogies to Iraq and Afghanistan. The cinematography replicates the gritty stock and overexposed lighting of recent international problem films (such as RENDITION and BABEL), and the tone goes from the darkness of the previous seasons a bit too far into out-and-out bleakness. There are too many fancy torture scenes here (and in other episodes during the season), and it's a big relief when the fleet gets back into space. The succeeding episode, ""Collaborators,"" is one of the best of the series, and some of the other stand-alone episodes are quite intelligently done. But by the end of the season, when the show has bizarrely become an endless courtroom drama (with Apollo a defending attorney!) you feel like the writers have become a bit bored by the premise and don't know where to go next. It may be the best thing for the series that it ends next season.

The acting on this series can be absolutely first-rate, and Grace Park, Alessandro Juliani and Katee Sackhoff continue to turn in terrific performances episode after episode. Some of the other actors seem a  bit hampered by the fact their characters seem caught in a creative revolving door: yet again we have to see Colonel Tigh descend into alcoholic sprees and depressive bitterness, Laura Roslin struggle with cancer, and Apollo and Starbuck have another fling. The special effects are sometimes heartstoppingly beautiful, as with a flight through a bullseye -colored planetary storm system and a battlestar falling through clouds towards the ground of a planet below; at other times, such as in the scenes set on the Cylon basestars, the sets seem cheaply furnished courtesy of a Seventies mall headshop. The whole season is worth seeing despite its wild unevenness: you always feel at the very least the creative team is trying at something, even when they don't quite succeed.",1206748800,26,3148,5.085106382978723
2805193,5,B000OY8NCE,"Having read some of the reviews here, I'm left wondering whether or not I watched the same show that they did.  I will admit that there were a few episodes here and there that really did nothing to move the major story-line plot along.  However, I can't, or won't say that I didn't find those particular episodes lacking in entertainment value; because they didn't.  But, frankly, this series has been great and any series that presents the season finale that season 3 did for this show is just simply excellent.  1.  A fleet dead in the water w/Cylons bearing down.  2.  The revelation of most of the unknown Cylon models, (and who they were).  3.  The reappearance of a main character thought dead, with the revelation that she'd been to Earth and knows the way.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I've been chomping at the bit waiting for season 4 to get started.",1206748800,,867,4.535483870967742

2805218,5,B000OY8NCE,"It is of considerable (psychological) interest to me how broadly distributed across the spectrum reactions to this season have been. Here is my reaction, for what it is worth.

This is the best season of BSG so far. Individual shows suffer from individual weaknesses, but as a whole *I* was unable to ""put it down.""
(1) ""I"" -- this is my more or less subjective opinion, and,
(2) It is a DVD and not a book ...

One of the strengths of the season was that the sexual violence was diminished while the psychological dysphasia was amplified. Character development was given some *SERIOUS* attention. And for all of his flaws -- in more than a few instances, because of them -- Colonel Tigh is something of a personal hero to me. After spending much of season 3 delaminating, he gets one of the best lines of the series in the final episode of this season. Of course, noble sentiment can often be a setup to an even greater fall -- this is BSG.

As noted, a few individual episodes were not as strong as others. But my biggest complaint against the *season* is that the writers/directors once again chose to end on a cliff-hanger. This seems rather sophmoric  on their parts; they evidently do not trust their audience to return after the break to see the 4th (and evidently final) season.

The DVD's are still worth owning. The stories are good and many of them are exceptional; while the acting, camera work, lighting and sets are consistently rich in that BSG sort of way.",1206230400,3,1472,4.5606060606060606
2805219,5,B000OY8NCE,"This is one of my favorite shows on television right now, if not the best.  The writing is top notch.  It's a show that makes you feel and think, in equal measures.  There were moments this season in which I was sincerely thrilled in ways I haven't been by 99.9% of the other shows currently on tv, and there were other moments when I was so touched and so emotionally caught up in what was going on with the characters that it was just heart-wrenching.

This is the show that, after I watch each episode, I don't sell the set on Ebay, I don't give it to a friend, I don't put it in cold storage, I treasure it, I put it somewhere safe and convenient and I watch the episodes over and over, at my leisure, because they are that good.  I never get tired of this show.  I will never part with my season 2 set and I am going to buy a copy of season 1 just so that I will have it.

If you want some good compelling television, this is it, maybe it's not always perfect, but it's as close as you can come with what's on television these days.",1206230400,3,1037,4.029268292682927
2805220,2,B000OY8NCE,"BSG has had something of a sordid history with video quality on dvd.  my motivation for writing this review is to let others know what the quality of the product is, as opposed to the quality of the show.  if you're a fan, you're going to want to buy this, we already know that.  but what exactly are you getting for your money?

a brief history of BSG on DVD
with the release of the miniseries on dvd, fans were treated to a digital quality copy of the source material.  this dvd was far from perfect though, suffering from excessive grain in every shot.

with the release of the seasons 1-2.5 box sets, audiences were treated to a much better visual experience.  the show itself is shot on HD, so these transfers benefited from much better source material.  on a 42' HD set, these DVDs looked fantastic.

the BSG season 1 HDDVD release held a lot of promise, as it's only logical that a show shot in HD should be viewed in it's native format.  sadly this version BSG season 1 looked arguably worse than its standard def counterpart.  this version suffered from excessive grain, low contrast, a lack of delineation of fine detail in dark scenes, and a blown out color palate.  the HD release looks even worse than the universal HD broadcasts, which suffers from its fair share of problems.

being familiar with the hit or miss quality of BSG on disc, it was with some anxiety that i picked up this boxed set.  sadly my fears have been borne out, as season 3 is one of the worst presentations of BSG available.

the details:
20 episodes are packed onto 6 dual layer discs, which would appear to provide ample space for a high video bitrate and any commentary/subtitle tracks.  unfortunately the video quality is beyond sub-par, the biggest complaint here being rampant grain in almost every single scene.  for the record, i've viewed every episode in the set (although i have yet to work my way through all of the commentaries).  i know people are thinking ""grain"", all this guy talks about is film grain, well it's film get used to it.  no, i won't.  well-lit scenes look great, but the darker a scene gets the worse the detail gets.  since so much of the show takes place in dimly lit interiors of various spacecraft, this deficiency hits BSG particularly hard.  this version of season 3 is definitely a step up from the standard def broadcast versions, but if you've seen any BSG on sci-fi HD or universal HD you're going to feel cheated.

bit rates hang around a very average 4Mb/sec.  for comparison the seasons 1-2.5 box sets hover around 8Mb/sec, which (math time!) means these dvds check in at roughly half the quality.  so it's not just me being picky here, there's a quantifiable difference in video quality between this release and earlier box sets.  the main difference, as far as the human eye is concerned, is that these dvds lose much of the fine detail inherent in the source material.  look at virtually any scene aboard the galactica and you'll see what i mean.  the BSG interior design is filled with clean lines and deep shadows, none of which comes through on this release.  at first i wasn't convinced that these dvds could really be so bad.  i figured that maybe the discs were suffering because of upconversion to 1080p, courtesy of my ps3, so i turned off upconversion.  even at 480p these dvds look every bit as awful as i had feared.  bottom line, this is most visually disappointing presentation of what is otherwise a visually stunning show.

extras:
included in this set are some deleted scenes, an extended cut of the episode unfinished business, and some web-released content that is now being billed as a ""special feature"".  the deleted scenes don't change anything major throughout the season, and would appear to be largely cut for time.  the extended episode is easily the best bonus feature, as it just feels like you're really getting something extra, whereas most of the material i could do without.  the podcast commentaries are by far the weakest of the bonus features.  they are every bit as cheap sounding as one might imagine a podcast to sound, and lack the thoughtful introspection i'm accustomed to hearing on commentary tracks produced after the on-air run of an episode.  there are only two proper commentary tracks included in the set, and they are what one would expect.  i completely bypassed the video blog and webisodes, since i've no interest in the former and have already seen the latter.  if you're a fan of youtube quality video on dvd, by all means spend your time watching these.

my big beef with this release is that it seems to pack a lot of special features, but does so at the expense of the main attraction; the episodes themselves.  yes i like special features, but good ones, why not use more of that valuable storage space to up the quality of video?

the bottom line here is this; if you, like me, want to brush up on season 3 before season 4 airs this is really your best option unless you've tivo'ed the HD episodes.  the video quality of this set is superior to the standard def broadcast and itunes downloads, but beyond that there's not much to be said about quality here.  if you're gifted with more patience than i, i would suggest waiting for a blu-ray release.  given the quality of the first HD BSG release though, i still hold a fair amount of skepticism.  in the end, it gets two stars simply for being BSG.",1206144000,19,5390,4.5958115183246075
2805221,2,B000OY8NCE,"What a frackin awful mess.  I really liked Seasons 1 & 2.  Season 3 however was a waste of time as it barely moves the story along but instead wallows in pointless subplots and flashbacks.  What were the writers and producers smoking? Maybe two episodes are even worth watching, at most. At this point I am not sure I'll even bother with Season 4.  Don't waste your time, pass Season 3 up.",1206144000,9,389,4.361111111111111
2805222,4,B000OY8NCE,"As with all reviews this is about both the qualty of the set and the show. If you disagree post a review as these reviews are designed to help fans who haven't purchased or seen the show make a decision NOT whether you agree or disagree (that's what the comments section is about). Moving on...

Every season of every TV show has episodes that don't stand up to the best that has come before and after. The show looks very good. The extras include podcasts, deleted scenes a terrific extended episode of one of Ronald Moore's favorite episodes ""Unfinished Business"". There are also 2 episode commentary tracks in addition to the podcasts ported over from the web from the original broadcast. David Eick's video blogs are also included as well as the webisodes (which I never got around to watching so it is kind of cool having it here). I would appreciate more behind-the-scenes type of specials but I like that sort of stuff. Fans who just want the episodes will be pretty well served by its presentation here.

This is another really good set. I am disappointed that we don't have a Blu-ray version (yet) and I find it unlikely that Universal will be releasing this on HD-DVD with the collapse of the HD-DVD consortium. The show looks better than the standard definition broadcasts but not quite as sharp as the high definition. I'm looking forward to the fourth and final season of this terrific show. I'm also looking forward to Moore's future series (I am a bit disappointed with ""BG"" producer David Eick's update of ""The Bionic Woman"" which, while it has its moments can't even compare to ""BG"").

PLOT SUMMARY AND SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:  The third season has to my mind some of the best episodes of the series particularly during the episodes on New Caprica leading up to the deliverance from the Cylons. When we last saw the survivors of humanity they had settled on New Caprica. They were abandoned by the Galatica and Pegasus when multiple Cylon warships showed up in orbit because Adama (Edward James Olmos)and Lee (Jamie Bamber)felt that they weren't prepared to take them on. We get a healthy glimpse into the rigors and harshness of the Cylon occupation showing that, interestingly, they aren't any better or less flawed than their human captors.

Saul(Michael Hogan)has started a resistence movement carrying out guerilla warfare against the Cylons to try and cause as much damage as possible in hopes of helping Adama on the ground when the Galatica returns to save them.

From there the series deals with the fall out of settling on New Caprica in the first place, how humanity will deal with collaborators (it's one of the most riveting episodes of the season in my opinion), find out that the Galatica and the Cylons are on the right course for Earth and that there is a mysterious plague striking the Cylons. As with previous episodes the show deals with a number of ethical issues that other shows wouldn't (and couldn't) touch. I know that there are those that were disappointed with the 3rd season feeling it ran too long or that many of the stand alone episodes were weak but I would disagre; I felt that the quality was consistent with the first two seasons dealing with interesting and complex themes.",1206057600,5,3225,4.75

The pace is deliberate and suspenseful but if I was watching these episodes as they happen on TV I might find the pace maddeningly slow, but on DVD it is absolutely perfect.

  In any book or comedy routine, it's impossible to have climax after climax after climax. At some point you have to give the audience a chance to catch their breath and enjoy the nuances.
  As on any trip, there is an expectant departure and an exciting arrival. The points of interest along the way depend on the observer.
  Personally I loved the middle episodes of season 3, particularly the forwarding of actor Tamnoh Penket (Hilo) as a main character. The concluding trial is a tour de force by Jamie Bamber (Apollo).
  Seasons 1 and 2 had their fillers also (see food shortage, prison ship).

But Season 3 started out great (wrapping up the New Caprica storyline from the end of Season 2.5) and it certainly finished strongly, setting up the upcoming final season in gripping style. If you can put up with about five weak episodes in the middle, Season 3 is more than worth owning.",1205625600,4,535,4.525773195876289
2805257,5,B000OY8NCE,"Season 3 finally takes the viewer into the world of the Cylon and starts the process of deconstructing the barriers between human and Cylon. From its deeply distopian beginning with the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, the viewer is forced to consider their preconceptions on issues such as torture, suicide bombing and the legitimate boundaries of resistance.

The rescue in the Exodus episodes is a stunning and tense piece of drama and the SFX are a match for Hollywood's big budget movies. The human relationships - especially Kara/Lee/Anders/Dualla;Tigh and Ellen; Roslin and Adama - are teased out more in this season and there are great subtleties in some of the writing - and acting.

The deaths of Kat and Ellen Tigh - along with the now infamous death and later reincarnation of Starbuck - maintain the toll on the emotions.  Some people did not like episodes such as The Woman King, A Day in the Life, Dirty Hands because they felt they did not advance the story arc.  This imho is unfair as they each provide unique insights into the way society and some key individuals operate.  Each episode explores an issue of importance and its resolution advances our understanding of the pressures on people and society.

With the last three episodes and Baltar's trial, the writers really stepped up to the plate. Superb dialogue, character conflicts, treachery and loyalty and the tension in the courtroom would be enough in its own right.  But this all sets the scene for the shock outing of four of the Final Five Cylons - a real roller-coaster ride.

And the ending with the 'return of' Starbuck and the sight of Earth - what a way to set up the Final Season!

BSG 1 was one of the best seasons on television I'd seen in a long time.  BSG season 2 and 2.5 were equally gripping and held high some cinematic excellence.  Season 3 was a tremendous disappointment and letdown.  My wife will no longer watch.  It has become a scifi soap opera.  They showed Vipers exit the launch tubes a handfull of times, and focused on everyones relationships.

Character development is one thing, but completely changing the face of the show and moving away from the action was a season killer for me.",1204934400,17,713,4.64
2805259,4,B000OY8NCE,"I love BSG but season three is IMHO the weakest season so far, mind you it's not a weak season. I agree that the pace of this season is a lot slower. I also agree with the criticism that the whole 'search for Earth' &  'Lords of Cobol' story-arc is almost completely absent from this season (and there are not many cylons to be seen either).

Still it was (and is) very entertaining and great Sci Fi. And after all the development of the main characters is a good thing (though I don't see the need to do it all at once :-)

The episode where Galactica dives into the atmosphere is probably the best episode in the whole series so far and some of the greatest SciFi television ever.

BUT : I have an enormeous problem with the idea that you sacrifice a capital ship like that - meaning Pegasus which is of course the fastest, strongest and most modern battlestar of the two.  From a story-point of view you could say, okay they had to lose pegasus (and after all, the show is called BSG and not BSP) but really, flying your ship into the middle of a cluster of base-stars ?

That's probably the most morronic tactic you could think of even if you had to improvise.  'no no sweet Cylons, no need to surround me, I'll do the  hard work for you ??!! What the frak was that about ?'

I wouldn't receive Lee Adama as a hero after that one. He did not follow orders and lost a capital ship with invaluable resources (modern medical facilities, repair shops, equipment, food-supplies etc. etc.) in the process.  In the real world they shoot you for things like that...

Considering what a brilliant idea it was (story-wise) to have Galactica dive into the atmosphere the 'solution' on how to remove Pegasus from the story is a big let-down.",1204588800,,1733,4.384375
2805260,5,B000OY8NCE,"Most people would be slightly weary of the idea of a new and re-invigorated version of the spectacle Science Fiction Drama series Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) being up to the year in which the series became 'Galactica 1980', which lead to its thoroughly trashed downfall, was a bit of a surprise that a network had decided to re-fashion the show with a more updated and far more interesting story. Many fans would, should insist that this is a re-imagining not an intrinsic remake of a cheesy lovable, and to use a pun for a modern show, ""That 70's Show"". Many of the sci-fi fan-boys, and girls, were in need of a successful sci-fi drama series that had the ability to keep fresh interest and action with drama to top.

The show comes from that concept of a 2003 mini-series, a somewhat thorough and enjoyable close to 3 hr pilot. The principal point, machines are made by man, evolved, rebelled, and a war began.

Sci-fi rubbed off on this show, and it pays to respect it with homage's. With elements from novelist Philip K. Dick from his earlier works of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" now known as the film adaptation ""Blade Runner"" along with the dark twisted parallel of the humanoid Cylons, and that mirrored `skinjob' reference. It also manages to match the dark allegory of P. K Dick' ""Valis"" a unique exploration of plethora's and universal metaphysics.

The virtuous and glamoured imagery bears the likeness of Kubrick' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with cross-cut scenes of Baseships in the sunlight of a nearby star, with a score to match. The score itself is very cinematic, in that it mixes and mingles with the imagery of the show to great exertion; continuously trying new techniques and new ways to give the eye candy. The score feels very dark, operatic and at the same time very tautly tense; it again has mirrored Vangelis' score in ""Blade Runner"" with the deep drum sound to hard hitting acoustics.

Battlestar Galactica is the best character drama that has the real dexterity of raw emotion; the acting shapes plot and vice versa. The characters are flawed and they should be, the situation creates the drama and evidently shapes the characters actions. It perhaps is the only show to bludgeon the scene with taut and well crafted dialogue and sharpest whit, measured writing that current shows like LOST and Heroes could benefit from. The dialogued scenes are spot on quality, the actors all themselves have unique range; perhaps currently the best acting troupe on TV. They have unique ability to play different parts of their personas during the course of a single episode, and still bring a sense of morality, logic and whit to the role; very much unlike a ""space opera"".

The acting troupe has characters including Edward James Almos' brilliant depiction of Commander/Admiral Adama; easily being a favourite. His slightly depressed attitude yet experience make him capable, if not slightly down heartened. His display as a commander of the pride of the fleet does show why he is the best person to have control of a superior vessel. He is quick to think, act and knowing what the cost is with the troubles of his confounded life. Two other characters change form and gender, the two now female, where the Galactica predecessor had two male characters, (when fans should not complain) Katee Sackhoff as Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, is born into the role of a hard-headed female Viper pilot. As well as the other female candidate played by Grace Park nicknamed 'Boomer'.

One thing this show does well is giving the most unexpected outcome possible, real credit to the writers that show they have a lot of grenades to go certain ways and that their bold spontaneity will either be accepted or judge by audiences. The writers of this show are very clever, in that you might think they plan out the show years in advance a la ""Babylon 5"" or ""Lost"" however you could not be more wrong. The show is written by boldly engaging the big issues currently on TV. You wonder how does a rag-tag fleet survive in the most logical and pragmatic way, scripted to show you that the real evidence of this is present in stories inspired by recent history and current events.

Truth is that many aspects of futuristic life may well be reflected on the current stand stead of today's socio-political and ethical conflict, that's if we decide to create robots that want to kill us. The themes themselves also reflect the big issues: drama, love, personal betrayal, post-9/11 parables, death, rape, murder, greed, religious extremism, depravity and also the antonyms when the situation lightens up (there is humour). In addition, unremittingly keeps putting forth the notion of what is exactly human. It's about genocide, war and the abyss after the precipice.

The special effects are not the only thing that shows high production value, it would put some of the current Trek franchise to shame. Everything is luscious, from the pure spot-on script and unexpected plots to the character actions and the big explosions going on outside.

The imagery splits from sporadic to perpetual, the effects are full of ardour CGI and digital FX, 'in the mind of the pilot/documentary' shot sequences. The new breed of improved and scary Terminator influenced Cylon centurions and human-looking Cylon infiltrators who's brutal degradation towards mankind reflects the worst parts of humanity. Is it pure hate, spite, jealousy or maybe because they have found a god to kill for; sound familiar? Moreover, what you have been waiting for, yes it does have graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it's not for everyone.

The World is over. The Fight has just begun. 10/10.",1203724800,5,5670,4.883575883575884
2805261,5,B000OY8NCE,"I was never a fan of the earlier Battlestar Galactica of the seventies. I preferred to watch Star Trek. However, I am hooked on this remake. The acting is great and the plot captivating. The characters are believable, and the cinematography quite spectacular. There are many twists in the story: you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode. My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!

Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.

Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica. Gaius Baltar, the President of the twelve colonies, surrenders to them, while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.

Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule. A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons, and sacrifices are made. We see humans strapping themselves with bombs, and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.

Can we stop for a second here? Isn't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel, and the Iraqis in Iraq? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one's disposal should be used to attack the invader, including using humans as bombs? Furthermore, terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder. To the colonials, the terrorists are freedom fighters. To the Cylons, they are simply terrorists. There are some provocative scenes, but after all, this is the kind of world we live in.

We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials, and to resume his quest to find Earth. The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't watched the show yet: Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials. The Season continues with trying to find Earth. New clues are discovered, and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.

Season 3 focuses on the human element, survival, and punishment. Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama, some crew members take the role of vigilante, ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock. These `victims' are not judged by a jury of their peers, nor are they given legal representation.  Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone. Again, depends through which eyes you are looking. Adama did not see such actions justifiable, and he put a stop to them. However, the perpetrators, or self-appointed jury, were never charged.

I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons. There is talk of genocide, and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons. But wait a second. Cylons are machines. If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple, would this be genocide? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA, would destroying them then qualify as genocide? Meanwhile, though, the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race, resorting to living in harmony with them. Again, the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series. Isn't this what good TV is all about?

Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar, bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham. Again, whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder. We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons, but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well. His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics. I personally thought that episode was the best one. I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.

The Season ends with a huge revelation: some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons. I won't tell you who, because I know some of you who haven't seen the show will read this review, and this revelation could spoil the whole season! Just let's say you will be utterly surprised. However, I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation. We'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means. Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony?

Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode. We saw her die three episodes earlier. She says to Lee,""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is, and I'm going to take us there."" Is she a Cylon too? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy?

I really enjoyed the bonus disk, ""The Story so far."" This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season. There were many scenes I had forgotten, and this episode sort of brought everything together again.

There is only one issue I have with this show: I think there are too many standalone episodes that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show. The major appeal of this show (at least to me) is its continuity: how each episode continues on the previous one. Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline, and slows down the action.

That's the way my friend first summed up the first few episodes, and I'd have to say I agree. I wasn`t entirely enthusiastic about the immediacy of the issues presented, but I suspect that's the idea.

The don't pull any punches but the do leave some viewers way outside of their ethical comfort zone, when it comes to issues of torture, wmd's, insurgency and occupation, which again is not such a bad thing since the reality of the real war is incomparably worse than most of us can possibly imagine.

Personally though, at the time this series came out I was also studying the neoconservative political movement, and the unrelenting surreal nature of hubris, coupled with the real news and the unreality of the real political discourse in that quarter of our political landscape was such that I found that not watching BSG until this examination was finished was preferable.",1202169600,4,1066,4.782608695652174
2805265,4,B000OY8NCE,"Battlestar Galactica's new incarnation is superb entertainment. The first two seasons were the best show on television, SciFi or otherwise. Huge themes, such as an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world born of the robot servant's revolt (the Cylons); or a theory of human genesis that posits sister worlds, is interwoven with minute intimate personal detail of fascinating charaters. Characters are explored - their pasts delved into to reveal their evolving natures. These individual threads are picked up and engage the main threads and build towards exciting conclusion after exciting conclusion. The central plot - humanity's struggle against the robot Cylons is nuanced as well. There are moments of savagery on the part of the humans, and moments of odd tenderness, vulnerability, and spirituality on the part of the Cylons. Like life, there is little black or white. Hated characters become humanized, then loved. Characters evolve and change. They are scarred by their experiences (physically and psychically) - and are never again the same. This all increases the sense of reality and our (the viewer's) sense of involvement. Many of the plots echo current events - New Caprica looks like Iraq, for example. The writing, on the whole, is exemplary.

Battlestar's staging succeeds as well. The special effects advance the state of the art for television. As others have noted, technology does not dominate. In fact, many key technologies are familiar - or even retro: they use telephone handsets with intermittent audio problems; guns shoot bullets; space fighters look like 1960s jet fighters; ""Dradus"" looks like contemporary radar; books are on paper (albeit with a trapezoid shape); their computers are not networked by design. Like the rest of the writing, even these small details are explained and woven into the plot - the anti technology slant is a reaction to the Cylon's revolt. This allows the plotting and writing to remain in the fore - transcending the SciFi genre. I didn't even mention the subtle and addictive language ""Galactica speak"" that you will soon be talking (if you don't already). This is some 'frackin' good stuff indeed.

Season 3 starts where season 2 left us - with the Cylons occupying the human settlement on New Caprica and oppressing the humans.  The humans react with armed resistance and acts of insurrection including a suicide bombing.  This depiction of armed insurrection as a basic human response to oppression is bold, and extremely brave considering the political environment at the time those episodes were written and filmed.  These early episodes in Season 3 are controversial, thus, and as hard to watch emotionally as anything in the series.  To folks who feel that this means the writers of this show have joined Al Qaeda, I'd refer them to read history, including the history of the American Revolutionary War.  Americans have behaved this way before (not that the humans of Battlestar Galactica's world are Americans, of course, but they represent us - unavoidably.  The 1984 film ""Red Dawn"" is all about American citizens engaging in insurrection to fight the Russians for example).  The resolution of the New Caprica crisis involves a space battle that contains the most thrilling special effects sequence I have ever seen on the small screen.  The finale is also extraordinary - involving a mind blowing confluence of events impossible to even remotely characterize without spoilers but involving brilliant plotting, emotional power, and fantastic special effects too.

So why not 5 stars? Season 3 has a tough time exceeding the high bar set by the first two seasons. Other than the New Caprica beginning and that crackling ending, the focus on Gallactica and the Colonial Fleet becomes absolute for much of the remainder of the season and the show loses sight of the Cylons. This is a shame. The battles with the Cylons - both physical and psychological, are the wellspring of the show's crackling tension. Without the Cylons in view, the show sags. We have an airlock crisis, a whole show about Admiral Adama's memories of his troubled marriage, a long show trial of Gaius Baltar - that while dealing with great issues and having great moments lacks the life or death slam of events in the first two seasons.  Season 3 is more cerebral, and less action packed than the first two. Is it still worth watching? There are many great moments even in the slower episodes.  If you've come this far you've probably fallen in love with the characters and will not mind some psychological background story.  Plus, you're crazy if you don't watch the first two seasons and if you do you'll absolutely need to wait on tenterhooks for season 4 with the rest of us - and you'll need to have watched season 3 for continuity alone. Make no mistake, season 3 is still great television - just not quite up to the heart pounding level of the first two seasons, that's all. The finale to season 3 is incredible, and will leave you panting for more. So say we all!",1202169600,115,5015,4.983253588516747
2805286,5,B000OY8NCE,"From what ive seen enough of (24, prison break, lost, CSI, bones, eureka, stargate, heroes, Dr who etc) Battlestar Galactica is quite easily the best out of them. I won't go through why I think the other named series aren't good enough (because it would take all day) but ill say why BSG is top quality.

Season 3 starts with the new caprica arc which is the best opening four episodes for any season because they were true to the storylines and were written by Ron moore (who will direct in season 4) and BT and DW who are excellent writers. This arc finishes with Exodus part 2 which is the best episode ever filmed and is almost flawless. After new caprica we have all the bulldog, kat, and genocide stuff which for the most part is very good but at Unfinished Business most people say it was one of the worst they have made. But its an amazing episode but if it would take ages to tell you why so ill just say that its something that grows on you.

Season 3 mid season was nothing compared to last seasons with Pegasus and the resurrection ship but and was when I as a viewer felt that BSG was losing its steam just like all big-budget series do (lost, prison break, 24, heroes). After mid-season you could call the next four boring but I would say these average episodes (apart form a day in the life whcih was bad) of BSG are a lot better than the best episodes of other series. It is this characteristic that sets BSG apart from other series.

The final arc is what everyone waits for in BSG, the last 4 episodes of the season... After wathing all four for the 1st time I thought there was no question that the final arc last season was the better but I realised that this arc is patchy but still is equal if not better overall than last season. Maelstrom and the son also rises couldve been better but still are  decent episodes. Crossroads part 1 and 2 are both excellent and are real examples of why BSG is something that is amazing and underated.

Dont get me wrong this season was the worst season out of the 3 seasons (season 1 being the best) there are and no one should be under any illusions about that (the seasons don't just get better and better- it works like sequels for movies-its very difficult to make a sequel thats better than the predecessor). However, season 3 overall is far beyond any season of any other series ive seen so that make this season still pretty amazing then!

On the transfer, i would say that its the best dvd transfer ive ever seen (note thats probably because its shot in HD) so kudos to universal for that. Dont be fooled by some of the grain you WILL see, that is added in post-production by BSG to make it look intense. All the clear stuff can be seen on any planet they are on ie new caprica. The level of detail on close ups is very high and colour saturation is rock solid. Sound is decent not spectacular but we all know we want the picture quality more than sound.

If you're not into scifi it doesnt matter youll like this...  its not star trek (the common misconception). Remember everyone who starts watching this gets addicted and I am yet to meet a person who has willingly given it a proper chance and doesnt like it. This is a series you must own...
Think about it what other series can you think of that offers insane cgi (so good Lucas tried to sue BSG for copying off Star Wars and lost), intense action in ships and on ground, nuclear warfare, sex, drugs, threesomes, torture, rape, suiside bombers and normal suiside..the list goes on. All that and a show that movie directors look up to ie Tarantino

Highly Recommended.

Roll on the last season... He that Believeth in me

2805288,5,B000OY8NCE,"Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.

Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having ""us"" attack ""them"" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.

On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the ""stand alone"" variety. All of the ""mythology"" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.

Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.

Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.

1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.

2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.

3. The death of Jammer: In ""Collaborators"" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.

4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying ""Adama wouldn't lie to me"" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: ""I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie."" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, ""And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral."" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.

5. ""Exodus, Pt. 2"": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained ""The Adama Maneuver"" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named ""Exodus, Pt. 2"" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.

6. The fight between Kara and Lee in ""Unfinished Business."" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, ""I missed you."" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, ""I missed you too."" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.

7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six ""I love you"" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.

8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/

9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.

10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: ""The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues ""a bogie at my ten"" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, ""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there."" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.

This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clichs that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this.",1201132800,21,13788,4.599186991869919
2805289,5,B000OY8NCE,"and it's a big BUT, and a big IF. BUT - it shows signs of losing the plot midway, and IF - season 4 pulls it all together again. And, I'm afraid, there are a few threads that it would take a Thomas Pynchon (Gravity's Rainbow) to pull together with style - we have the weird love triangle on the Cylon ship, with Baltar, No 6, and the Cylon D'Anna ( playe by Lucy Lawless, 'Xena, warrior princess'), and new hints about Baltar's destiny, and then D'Anna goes doo-lally, and there's the ongoing mystery of why Baltar and No 6 hallucinate each other's presence - all that alone would take a genius to pull together, and there's much more, like Sharon 2's child, and why the Cylons didn't know who the final 5 were. I've just watched the series 4 sneak preview on the Razor dvd; one of the cast says a lot of balls were thrown in the air in series 3, and he thought some of them were bound to get dropped - that's a hint!
All the same, I can't think of ANY other series that would be worth Pynchon's talents.

It starts great; there's a change of pace, announced at the end of season 2, with the Cylons changing tack, and deciding against exterminating the humans. The occupation, escape and consequences are great, and continue the momentum of the previous 2 series through discs 1 and 2 , episodes 1 to 8. As other reviewers have noted, episode 8, Hero, has a rather unconvincing plot, but it does contribute important background to the plot. However, I find Sharon's wholesale conversion to the human side a lingering weakness, though not a fatal one; I can indulge them a bit of artistic licence - this is SF, not Tolstoy, and all the better for it, in my opinion. But there's a slight sore thumb: in one episode we see the Cylon's deciding that Sharon's baby must be protected at all costs; then, in the next episode we see Sharon saving the fleet from a Cylon all-out extermination attempt - this does not compute!
But there's a bigger sore thumb - as previous reviewers have noted, when they have a chance to destroy the Cylons and save the human race, SOMEBODY SABOTAGES IT AND NOBODY SEEMS MUCH CONCERNED - WITHOUT EXPLANATION (apart from, possibly, some qualms about genocide)! That just seemed to dissipate the momentum of the story (though it certainly picks up again). I really hope the writers have realised that and will make sense of it in season 4, I hope they don't just glide over that. Anyway, their plan wouldn't necessarily have finished off the Cylons - just the ones on the closest Resurrection ship. That was sloppy too. Come to think of it, they could fix most of the outstanding flaws by inserting a few 30 second scenes here and there, but then I'd have to shell out more money for a new 'director's cut' - I probably would too!

The next episode is where things start dropping slightly below standard, for me, and this continues for the next 2 discs, episodes 8-16; momentum having already been lost a bit, in my opinion, we now find what some reviewers have called a 'soap opera' intruding - a lot of time being spent on the mixed up love lives of some of the major characters. Opinions seem divided over episode 9, Unfinished Business, which concentrated on love lives - I couldn't say it wasn't good, and it fills out the characters a bit, but I find myself itching to use the fast forward for the first time in my BG life - maybe I'm a hopeless boy's adventure type. I agree with some reviewers that I found the next episode, the Passage, could have done with a pre-amble, but it's a good episode; BUT, it did leave a slight sour taste in my mouth - one recurring character is written out in a way that could be interpreted as suggesting that her heroic death was an atonement for her recently discovered previous criminal life - a bit severe, to say the least! And the the love interest from Unfinished Business crops up again to water down the next 3 episodes, which are great in themselves - it's not the human interest that bothers me, it's the amount of time it gets, and that the writers don't really do anything interesting with it. Then there's episode 14, the Woman King, which all reviewers including myself agree is a filler, and seriously below standard - but not that bad, really! And the next 2 episodes while very good, and containing more useful background, are a bit in the 'crisis of the week' mould. Episode 16, Dirty Hands, is great though - it's just a pity it comes 3rd in a row of 'slight diversion' episodes. Dirty Hands deals with industrial disputes and labour problems, and some of the dialogue hints, for the first time, at the class/power structure of the world of the colonies. This is something that has been missing from BG so far; in Babylon 5 and Joss Whedon's 'Firefly' the hinterland of corrupt politicians and shady corporate power is an important part of the story - without dwelling on it too much, we're made aware of the structure the characters inhabit, but BG seems to exist in the abstract - for instance, how did a system dependent on robot labour adjust after the robots rebelled? What about the corporate powers that manufactured the Cylons in the first place? All we know about the colonies (apart from hints given in this episode, mostly in a conversation between Chief and Cally) is that they have sports teams and an elected government involving a 'quorum of 12'. Dirty Hands helps fill it out a bit, but there's still a lot missing.

Anyway all the above niggles accumulate to diminish the spell a bit, for the first time, but Dirty Hands is the beginning of it getting back on form again, and the last 4 episodes are back to the old edge-of-the-seat form. The revelation of the remaining Cylons (bar one) is great, and done with real style, and I'm sure there's a good explanation coming up for that and how come you-know-who's been to Earth.

If all the above seems a bit negative, take it as read that I agree with all the praise others have heaped on it - there's no point in repeating it - this is still head and shoulders above anything else on the tv, even the Sopranos; and it's a good contender for the best tv series ever - it's certainly the best looking, and most convincingly realised science-fiction ever, on tv or feature film. But it still only gets my number 3 for favourite tv series, after Babylon 5 (though BSG makes B5 look like a stage-show) and Oz (HBO's prison drama)- maybe joint 2nd spot with Oz!, and I think I've figured out why, and a big reason why this series of BG wanders so much - there are too many significant characters, and many of them have doubles who are also significant characters(several in No 6's case); and some of the 'male romantic lead' types, like Apollo and Helo and Anders, are hard to tell apart at first glance, I find, because they're about the same size, weight and have similar hair colour and style.

But again, compared to nearly anything else, no praise is too high for Battlestar Galactica. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, MAKE IT ALL COME RIGHT IN SEASON 4.

A slight quibble about the discs though - some of them can be really reluctant to load; and the navigation - if I use the 'select episode' option, it sometimes takes me to immediately after the main theme music, missing out the bit of the story that always comes before it - could be very confusing to newcomers.

Watching this series is a great pleasure - and never disappointing, for it treats you as an intelligent person.

2805292,5,B000OY8NCE,"This is such a great show and its great that Sci-Fi finally decided to release season 3. This season slowed down in tempo a little bit during the middle but because of Sci-Fi putting pressure on the writers to diverge from the Arc-heavy plotlines that made Seasons 1 & 2 so great to more or less standalone episodes which mired Season 3 down a bit towards the middle...but then again its Sci-Fi, and they can never let a good thing be without screwing it up one way or another. However, Ron Moore has assured fans that Sci-Fi will return to the hands-off approach to allow the writers to end it on their own terms. Can't Wait!

BSG is something to behold, television at its finest.",1200096000,3,681,4.448
2805293,3,B000OY8NCE,"I will say that Battlestar Galactica is the best sci-fi series currently on TV. However, this most recent season feels much more defined by its bookends. Battlestar's third season started off with a bang, logically taking up the overarching plot from the end of the second season, and wrapping it up with four strong episodes. However, the season takes a nosedive from there.

While the episodes that follow fluctuate from entertaining and meaningful to mediocre and pointless, all of them share some common weaknesses. All of them are standalone episodes. Standalone episodes are only good if they are qualitative enough to justify a character study, small story, etc. or if they still contain small bits of the C-plot of where the series is going story-wise. However, due to Battlestar's very strange oil and water relationship between its standalone and overarching stories, the latter strategy is never implemented. What we get is a plethora of disjointed episodes that provide flash in the pan moments of exquisite acting and writing, but barely seem to make sense in the big picture, a balance which the previous two seasons were able to meet at higher degrees.

Throughout most of the season, you're waiting for something to happen. You're waiting for them to find a marker to Earth...you're waiting for more details into the final fates of certain characters. When those payoffs are hindered, even by relatively astounding standalone episodes, you're going to feel a bit cheated and a bit impatient. I would definitely say that Battlestar's third season is a ""bookend season,"" where the first four and the last two episodes are really all that truly mattered to the premise and plot of the series itself. With some amazing episodes, this season's rating is only hurt by its poor layout and meager story offerings.",1200009600,29,1821,5.066666666666666
2805294,4,B000OY8NCE,"First. This is a GREAT series which is doing a world of good for sci fi and popular acceptance of sci fi(as long as they don't follow the harry potter cookie cutter for fantasy movies as we have seen for the past few years)

And, this is a great season.  Some didn't like the ""artistic license"" taken in the last episode but I thought they did a very good job of the whole thing.

However, I have two negative points.  First this series keeps skipping the edge of good sci fi and popular (read petty) interpersonal plot devices to attract a wider audience.  Yet considering that they do such a good job with the rest of it that it is fairly easily overlooked.

The second negative point is the way the publisher/producer/studio???? keeps jerking us around in DVD sales.  They tried season 2 and 2.5, why, to get more money for the same package.  I might understand that its an expensive series to shoot yet we also find out that the writers strike comes about because so few are getting royalties on DVD sales.  Other regions get this MONTHS before the US does. Many of us wanted to watch it again before the 4th season comes out.  Now that is not possible! Also its originally slated for 60 dollars (a markup to make 40 dollars seem more reasonable??)  I understand the producers/publishers have to make money but I suspect given the popularity you are getting greedy and it may just bit them(I hope).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>My suggestion.  WAIT 6+ MO TO BUY THIS
wait till the price drops to 30 dollars or less.  Don't give in to the hype and pay the inflated prices.  Show the publishers that we want to be loyal fans, we want to buy it when it first comes out.  However, when they mess with us like this without making it widely known why they are delaying the release, playing around with prices etc.... we can exact punishment by not buying it for 6+ months.  We can show them that if they don't play nicely then neither will we.  Please  wait to buy this, and possibly send a message that we, the once loyal consumer, will behave when they do.  Or even buy it used when the opportunity exists.

I generally make it a point to buy things new when they come out to support the types of shows I want to see more of. but not this time. Im going used.",1200009600,8,2246,4.3768115942028984
2805295,3,B000OY8NCE,"Season 3 of Battlestar Galactica took over a bit after the second season finale, which found most of our heroes stranded on the dismal planet of New Caprica, under Cylon oppression, and with the odds tilted heavily against them in terms of being able to mount an effective resistance. The series's third season starts out with four episodes that must rank among the very best of the series, which detail the covert resistance against the Cylon occupation. It's four hours of television full of modern-day resonance, as we see the ""good guys"" grappling with the ethics of suicide bombings, and the ""bad guys"" are somewhat sympathetic as they sit in their councils and wonder why the humans aren't taking advantage of the great new order they have been promised. The lines are blurred, to some extent, and the fact that this does not come off as political agitprop (from the left or right) is a testament to series god Ronald D. Moore, whose conviction and attention to detail in setting up the political and personal implications of occupation is plausible and impressive. Characters are continually making sacrifices for what they think is right, regardless of what side of the conflict they take, and we see real courage all around. It is, in sum, a truly satisfying four hours of television. And the episode that follows immediately afterward, which involves secret trials for collaborators, is another masterpiece, especially in how it looks at Starbuck's feelings about her role (or lack of one) in the resistance, and it reminds us just how closely the personal and political can be entangled.

So, for the first quarter of the season, this show put out some great television. It's a pity that it couldn't keep up the pace. Instead, it seemed like as soon as our heroes found their way back aboard Galactica the show immediately lost any forward motion, preferring variations of stock stories like the infamous ""people trapped in the mine"" episode (A Day In The Life). At times, it doesn't feel like the arc of the series is being advanced at all--the episode with the evil, racist doctor is one such episode (The Woman King). And the show's focus gets broader to encompass the travails of the fleet's working class (Idle Hands) in an episode that feels like a lack of focus. Hell, that could be the entire season summed up in a nutshell--after a terrifically focused opening salvo and before the pretty good three-part finale, it seemed as the show had lost any sense of forward momentum. It frequently felt like the show was just going from week to week, and that the episodes could really be viewed in any order--this is not entirely true, as the story arcs were frequently advanced in minor ways in these episodes, but for a show that has all been about the big picture and all about the arcs from day one it is incredibly frustrated to have to watch all these intrinsically trite and uninteresting storylines, presumably intended to add more ""depth"" to the series, but that I suspect were included to entice more viewers to tune in. The gambit failed, and perhaps they'll be gone in the next (and final) season. Nevertheless, it is enough to make one doubt the show's trajectory as it concludes.

This is not to say that the season was a wasteland between the beginning and ending episodes--I felt that the Kat episode ""Maelstrom"" was actually quite good and appropriate, and the midseason two-parter in which the humans and Cylons square off over a planet that might just hold the key to the location of Earth certainly held my attention. But these were rare exceptions, countered with heavy doses of episodes like ""Hero"" that were impossible to care about even at the time one is watching them. Let's hope that the show is able to rediscover in its final season that ambition and vision that made the show such a hit in the first place.",1200009600,162,3848,4.776276276276277

2805327,5,B000OY8NCE,"Having grown up as a kid totally addicted to the original campy/glossy BSG I must say when I heard they were beginning the whole thing anew in a new big way I was excited! I remember all the hoopla and hubbub regarding the direction of the new series and treatments of characters and can safely say I love BOTH series with equal veracity.

Allow me to state however that the modern BSG is fast becoming for me one of THE greatest works of film making art I have ever had the privilege to witness. The story arc of the modern BSG series is beyond superlative. Unlike some other reviews I have been gripped equally by each season and have also been totally immersed in it's emotive and deeply powerful story line. To be quite honest the story line of BSG makes Star Wars seem like a cartoon by comparison and I love the Star Wars series as well.

I am not going to bother giving away ANY plot spoilers as it's the last thing any new viewer needs - all you need to know is that with each season that passes I find I can't get no frackin relief! It was an agonizingly long period to have to wait in Australia between Season 2 and Season 3, so much so I feared we'd never see it at all. Now I have literally just finished watching my edition all in the one hit in the space of 2 days ... after the final scene I HAD to jump online and read the reviews I had been deliberately avoiding!

This show kills me! So now I find out there is a new Mini Series prequel about Pegasus called RAZOR! When can I get this and when will it be released in Australia? If any Aussies out there care to fill me in I will be eternally grateful. All I can say is that I am totally spent after Series 3 and yet I NEED more already. Those who have watched this season already will know exactly what I mean when I say ...

""I can't get no relief""

Comparing it to the fun but often silly stuff that makes up most SF just won't do.  This  is a show for grown ups.

2805334,5,B000OY8NCE,"I continue to be amazed at how much I love ""Battlestar Galactica."" I usually don't enjoy science fiction, but this show is unlike any other sci-fi series I've seen before. In fact, ""BSG"" just may be my favorite television show of all time, which says a lot!

Season Three of ""BSG"" picks up right where Season Two left off. The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves. Unfortunately, the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down. After invading New Caprica, the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them. Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation. Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan, which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded. Obviously, the Adamas and their small crew can't just abandon the rest of humanity, and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.

I don't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet. However, there's a lot that goes on in Season Three, especially where Tyrol, Tigh, Tory, Anders, and Starbuck are concerned. If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking, just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three!

There are a few small issues I have with this season. First of all, I think there are too many ""one-shot episodes"" that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all. Having a few episodes like that is fine, but I think there were an abundance of them this time around. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the way certain music served as a major revelation during the season finale. Hopefully Season Four will do a good job of explaining things.

Overall, though, this was a great season. I'm very sad that there's only one more season left, but I can't wait for it to start up again in March.",1199750400,16,2038,4.529891304347826

My co-worker got a copy while there at Christmas on the off-chance that it would play on his US DVD player (it does not).  I put a sample url at the bottom this review ( -- apologies to Australia Guy on behalf of VA guy and UK guy ...)

As for the writers' strike postponing the release of Season 3, I've heard this, but it sounds like an internet rumour, and I have not found any real verification of it.  As far as I've found (reading about other DVD releases), the strike only affects DVD's for shows filmed after the writers went on strike. So, technically, they could release to DVD the 8 or so shows they already filmed in Season 4.  Let's hope they get to finish the series somehow.

David Huber's review below (or is it ""above"" ?) says it all.

I disagree with CornHolio (Australia Guy) -- I thought Season 4 was at least as good as the others.  I wasn't a fan of the ""courtroom drama"" episodes, but there were some fantastic episodes in Season 4.
However I do agree with CornHolio -- I do think he'd have a crack at Tricia Helfer -- we can all agree on that.

2805338,5,B000OY8NCE,"Some of the best writing in TV is in Battlestar Galactica. As well as some of the best acting.

All seasons have been great, but this one is particularly excellent - the characters and the people are truly struggling and striving to survive. Not a season of space battles, like the previous ones, but a season of introspection and character development. As well as a fair number of plot twists and ""Whoa! I didn't see that coming!"" moments.

I am constantly amazed at the depth of the writing in this series. It is filled with creative and complicated plot lines; many plot twists; and terse writing that is so efficient, that I often have to rewind and listen to a part of a scene again to get all the words. This series has the least amount of exposition of any show I remember seeing. It can make following what's happening difficult, but it makes for far more exciting and interesting story telling.

If you are new to Battlestar Galactica, I suggest that you start with the movie and then work your way through the seasons. The episodes don't exist very well on their own, since they are all intertwined in one grand narrative that one needs to watch from the beginning.

I think this series is brilliant. And not just as a science fiction fan, but also as a fan of writing and story telling in general. Technically, Battlestar Galactica is excellent. The story line is also compelling, watching a small group of human beings trying to find their way back to their ancestral planet of earth while they deal with issues of religion, mythology, lost and altered history, and fight their own mechanical creations which are more fundamentalistically religious than the human who created them.
