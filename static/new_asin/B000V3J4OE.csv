8216394,5,B000V3J4OE,"This is One AWESOME VIDEO about African American Artist from 1940-1965.  The Video has Super Rare Film Footage and Clips of the likes of James Baldwin, Sonia Sanchez, Ossie Davis, Arthur Mitchell, Deloris Browne, Raven Wilkins and just so many more  If you are
a fan of James Baldwin, he is covered extensively in this video.  Richard Wright and his relationship with James Baldwin both negative
and positive is explored.  Clips of Lorraine Hansberry and her Play, Raisin in the Sun  is also included. I just don't have the words to
describe the Great and Professional Job that Executive Producer, HENRY HAMPTON, Co- Executive Producer, SAM POLLARD and Producer, TRACY HEATHER STRAIN did in putting this Documentary together.  If you are a student of African American History and have access to a VCR don't let the Price Stop you from Purchasing THE DREAM KEEPERS 1940-1965.  It is More than Worth the Price,  FANTASTIC VIDEO!!!  Great to Share with Family and Friends, it's a Keeper.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",1420416000,,1006,5.006024096385542
