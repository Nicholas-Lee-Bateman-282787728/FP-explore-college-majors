6332612,4,B00J44A5DK,This is an excellent documentary of one mans dream to build an entire city. A great example of mid-century architecture as well.,1404000000,,128,4.863636363636363
6332613,5,B00J44A5DK,The little boxes DVD arrived quickly and in good condition. Little boxes is a documentary based on the book of the same name.,1400284800,,125,4.478260869565218
6332614,4,B00J44A5DK,"This short film is a paean to the good work of Henry Doelger. I live near this development and attest to its virtues.
But because it was produced by a realtor the controversies are left out of the film. Although the song ""Little Boxes""
appears at the end, nothing about it's controversial ideas are mentioned in the film. Also the rather authoritarian home
owners association is left out of the discussion. Definitely worth viewing.",1399161600,,432,4.851351351351352
6332615,5,B00J44A5DK,"This ""Little Boxes"" Documentary is HUGE historically! It really nicely covers the genius of Henry Doelger with his advanced thoughts on community.  The collaboration of Mr Keil & Ms Lamboradella was excellent. If one ""dreams"" and then acts, it can be accomplished. If you like City History, you will enjoy this a lot! We have the book, signed by Rob Keil as well and are proud as Daly City Dwellers to have both on our shelf!",1398556800,,425,4.592105263157895
6332616,5,B00J44A5DK,"Having grown up in South Florida with it acres and acres of cookie-cutter track houses, I was amazed at the beauty and cleverness of Westlake's revolutionary community design which completed well before I was born.

This documentary reveals the depth of thought and design that went into this truly amazing architectural development that provided the American Dream for so many working-class families.  It also reveals Henry Doelger to be the Henry Ford of community construction.  Unlike Mr. Ford, Mr. Doelger seems to have been a much, much nicer employer and a much broader innovator.

This proved to be one of the rare documentaries that I wanted to immediately watch after my initial viewing.",1397606400,2,697,5.1415929203539825
6332617,5,B00J44A5DK,"Raised in Westlake and as a member of the family I found this to be an accurate portrait of my uncle and father.
I  never realized when living through the events portrayed in this documentary how many peoples lives that they impacted.
Highly reccomend to all who have connections to this area and there are thousands of us. who do.",1396224000,4,331,4.516666666666667
6332618,5,B00J44A5DK,"Fantastic book!  You'll love this documentary if you're a fan of mid-century modern architecture, or are familiar with the Westlake suburb of Daly City, CA.  A great neighborhood with a fascinating history, and home to some of the coolest houses ever made!

Well done Mr. Keil!",1395964800,,277,4.978260869565218
6332619,5,B00J44A5DK,I lived in Daly City/Westlake all my life and this DVD brings back all the memories of how it used to be back in the day. So very interesting on how Henry Doelger built homes in his own creative ways like no other! I saw this video at a presentation by the writer and am so glad it is now available to purchase. I can't wait until I receive it!,1395532800,,344,3.9285714285714284
6332620,5,B00J44A5DK,"Having just seen this film, I was very impressed. I grew up in two Doelger homes, and honestly, I took them for granted until I saw this film. The narrator goes from the very onset of the conception of having a community to actually becoming a community. I don't want to give anything away, so I will leave it at that. This is definitely worth watching, and I plan to watch it again. Even if you did not grow up in a Doelger home, you will still enjoy this film. Great job.",1395273600,6,473,4.1521739130434785

8647869,5,B00J44A5DK,"I've bee studying suburban architecture, including New Urbanism. This is an example of New Urbanism before there was such a thing. My own neighborhood has examples of similar architecture that must have been inspired by Doelger's architect! Fascinating movie!",1444176000,,259,5.666666666666667
