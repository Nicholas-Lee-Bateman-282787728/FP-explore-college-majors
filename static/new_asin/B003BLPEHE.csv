4107033,5,B003BLPEHE,"The 1950's were the heyday for syndicated programs.  In some cases syndicated shows such as ""Sea Hunt,"" ""I Led 3 Lives,"" ""26 Men,"" ""Whirlybirds,"" and ""Death Valley Days,"" among others, were just as popular as their network brethren.  Arguably the most popular non-network program of the decade was ""Highway Patrol,"" starring Broderick Crawford.  An Oscar-winner for ""All the King's Men,"" Crawford had gone through a period of starring in mostly ""B"" pictures, and was looking for a regular payday.  Here you will find, in PRISTINE condition, the complete season 1 of ""Highway Patrol.""  Unlike bootleg copies of the show, you get the original opening sequence of a car quickly arriving at a highway patrol roadblock, and narrator Art Gilmore's preview of that evening's program.  Also, Crawford returns at the end of the show to give sage advice, such as, ""Clowns should only be seen at the circus, not on the highway,"" or ""Leave your blood at the Red Cross, not on the highway.""  I love it!  In addition, you get the complete closing credits of HP.  Rotating sergeants include future stars Paul Burke (""Naked City,"" ""12 O'clock High""), Stuart Whitman (""Cimarron Strip""), along with character actors William Boyett (""Adam-12"") and Terry Frost (countless 50's westerns).  And don't miss a pre-""Rawhide"" Clint Eastwood as a slick-haired biker in episode 27.  The audio on ""Highway Patrol"" is a 10, the video an easy 9 (only the occasional speck), and this is a one time chance to acquire a 55-year-old TV classic.  Snap this one up, and maybe season 2 will be offered later in the year.  Thank you for reading my review.",1281916800,176,1616,4.940740740740741

The quality of these DVD discs is excellent and it is so fun to look back to the past of what cars looked like, peoples fashions and just everything!!

4107062,5,B003BLPEHE,"Here is the first season of a T.V. show that is still talked about and seen today.  Broderick Crawford as Dan Mathews kept the action coming as did his co stars such as William Boyett who later went on to play the watch commander in the T.V. series Adam 12 as well as different police officer characters in Dragnet, and Guy Williams is also featured in a few episodes before donning a cape and using a sword as Zoro, and later exploring outer space in Lost In Space, Barbara Eden also puts in a role, as does Leonard Nimoy And Robert Fuller also were feature in episodes.

4107065,5,B003BLPEHE,"I love watching these 50s programs. The cars, the unpaved roads, the small cities and towns, what a blast from the past! They tell quite a story in just 25 minutes. Find a drama today that runs only 25 minutes (30 minutes with commercials). Academy Award winning actor Broderick Crawford is Dan Matthews, the head of the Highway Patrol office. Great stories. There's nothing like seeing '57 and '58 Fords in primo condition. So cool. So fun. You should check it out. 10-4?",1425945600,,472,4.698795180722891

4107068,5,B003BLPEHE,"I'd already purchased Seasons 2, 3, and 4 but Season 1 was just too expensive. I started putting $5.00 a week aside for several weeks and before I knew it l had the purchase price. This DVD package was worth every penny. Though they are black and white the picture is so sharp you don't miss the color.

This is real TV. The stories are well crafted. The actors are great in their personification of characters. None as deep as Broderick Crawford playing Dan Matthews the head of the highway patrol station. He makes you believe he was actually out there manning our roads and highways. He was a tough talking no nonsense officer of the LAW.

I will be rewatching these dynamic episodes again and again. They are way better than anything currently on TV. I am having so much fun watching it. You never know what the next episode is going to be about. It's like boxes of Crackerjacks for your TV, a prize in every story. Another fun thing is to try to recognize the actors and actresses.

Currently watching disc 10. The final story is a Christmas tale. How apropos. Happy viewing!!",1417996800,8,1081,4.505102040816326
4107069,5,B003BLPEHE,"One of my all time favorites.  The prints used here are fabulous, most so sharp, one can see all the
wrinkles and blemishes on actor's faces in close-ups.  So far I've seen the first 3 discs, so far, great !
  I read once, don't recall where, that one episode of the series, had Broderick Crawford in a very
bad state approaching intoxication.  Anybody know which season and episode that was?
  Also, in a trade publication around 1970 listing shows available for syndication the listing
for this series said ""some color""  were any episodes filmed that way?  Anyone know?",1416441600,3,571,4.744897959183674
4107070,5,B003BLPEHE,"Highway Patrol was a truly groundbreaking TV show in its day. The intro was very ""official"" sounding and made one aware of the importance of public safety. The show also gave ""new talent"" an opportunity to showcase their talents on this highly rated program. As you watch these episodes watch for Clint Eastwood and Guy Williams ( Walt Disneys Zorro ) but not together.

This 50's show will bring back fond memories for those who grew up in this special place in time.",1414886400,3,468,4.63855421686747

4107077,3,B003BLPEHE,"I'lm wondering WHEN this is going to be released by TGG. The current setup is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, & MADE AS YOU ORDER? What crap. The current company obviously is NOT selling many of these, but if the rights were turned over to TGG, Season One would be affordable & sell much better. I have Seasons Two, Three & Four, but will NOT purchase Season One until it is realesed by TGG. If the purchasing of Season One stays the way it is now, I will NEVER purchase it. I'll have to settle for what I have. I gave a rating of 3 stars ONLY because of the current price.",1401753600,6,560,4.1
4107078,5,B003BLPEHE,The first season of Highway Patrol is by far the best. The plots have more detail and Broderick is at his best barking orders to the rest of the team on the highway patrol. This has to be one of the first series shot on location which means you get to see a lot of what Los Angeles and suburbs look like in 1957 through 1959.,1401580800,4,325,3.9393939393939394
4107079,5,B003BLPEHE,"Early TV had a lot of good shows. It was a new post-war medium yet. A lot of movie actors moved into TV - and usually the fare was either a Police show, a comedy show or a western. The structure was all new to new the medium, and they had to pack a lot of writing into very short time frames. A lot of its flow requires the viewer to not only follow expressed plot but to be able to make logical assumptions to move it forward.",1399161600,3,427,3.8636363636363638
4107080,5,B003BLPEHE,"This is the first season(55/56)for Highway Patrol and it is a doozy. There are only four eps per disc,as compared to TGG's releases of the rest of the seasons which average about eight,which makes it look like they're a touch clearer(less compression?).This  season is done by MGM themselves.
Each ep at the end of the opening theme has a car quickly backing up and driving away, then the thank you to the highway patrols across the nation. You will see this footage is taken from the end of the pilot. You will hear Broderick tell us:It's not the car that kills,its the driver,or the reckless/careless driver isn't driving his car,he's aiming it,or.the clowns at the circus are real funny,but they're murder on the highway,or try to be the kind of driver you think you are,or leave your blood at the red cross,not on the highway. William Boyette who was to become to Highway Patrol,what Ken Drake was to Sea Hunt,appears for the first time in ep#3. And the audio supervisor is none other than Quinn Martin,later to produce such hit shows as The Invaders,The Street of San Francisco,Barnaby  Jones and  many others. Oh yes, and Broderick Crawford's first words:""All units been notified?"".
You'll see such known actors,and those to become better known,like:Clint Eastwood,Emil Sitka(The Three Stooges),Robert Fuller(Laramie,Wagon Train),Guy Williams(Lost in Space),Joe Flynn(McHales Navy),Stuart Whitman(TV and films) ,Bing Russell(Kurt's father),and many others. A big surprise is seeing on the screen, famous silent film director Erich Von Stroheim directing some eps.
All in all these eps look like they've been filmed yesterday. Some are grainy to be sure and a few in less than good shape(looks like the master film had gone and dupes were used).But overall it is a joy to hold in ones hands the entire first season of Highway Patrol starring Academy Award winner Broderick Crawford, with his pistol quick delivery. The set comes in three snap cases,four discs in  cases one and two, and two in case three. Enjoy a show the whole FAMILY can watch!

4107083,5,B003BLPEHE,"Ahh the Highway patrol! I can't say any bad about the Dan Mathews... he always gets his man or woman. He always talks so fast. I read other reviews on him, that they always had a show rapped up by noon because Mr Crawford would be drinking or drunk after that. That's why you see so much fog in a lot of the shows.

4107091,5,B003BLPEHE,"Best show ever. Really great if you enjoyed looking at classic cars from the 1950s. They are all brand spanking new. And the best part is you could read up on the show on the Internet, like the star of the show doesn't have a drivers license, which is why you never see him driving on a real city street. He is an alcoholic, which is why he always has cuts and abrasions on his face , from bar fights",1385337600,,400,4.0125
4107092,4,B003BLPEHE,"I remember watching this as a very young kid at my grandpa's. I mostly just remember the black and white classic police cars.

Broderick Crawford was the only real regular and, in spite of his drinking problems, overall he does a great job. The scripts are very straightforward - nothing fancy - no 2 parters, etc. But you really don't have much wiggle room in 23 or 4 minutes running times. On top of that they didn't have a lot of money. The subject material also gave them limitations - can't get too fancy and have it be within the bounderes of Highway patrol.

Picture is pretty good (B/W only) and sound is acceptable for this very old syndicated TV show. Writting is suprising good.

I got this at the library but may buy the next 3 seasons as they're much cheaper than the 1st one was.

I would rate this a very sold 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10. Recommended!",1375142400,4,859,4.316770186335404
4107093,4,B003BLPEHE,"This was a syndicated series produced by Ziv from the 1950's. It starred big Broderick Crawford in his only series which ran for four seasons playing no-nonsense Dan Matthews chief of the Highway Patrol. All of these have now been released on DVD.
This show tells the stories of the patrolmen of the Highway Patrol who roam around the country dealing with all sorts of nefarious activity. Anything from murder,car-jacking,bank hold-ups and kidnapping etc,etc. It was filmed in black and white and ran for twenty-five minutes. Plenty of gun-play in this show but the acting is kind of wooden. I enjoyed it anyway and it seemed to get better from the second season on. There are not a lot of famous faces in this series as guest stars. Here are the ones I spotted over the four seasons.
Barbara Eden (Jeannie) I Dream of Jeannie.
Ed Nelson (Dr Rossi) Peyton Place
Richard Bull (Mr Olson) Little House on the Prairie
Leonard Nimoy (Mr Spock) Star Trek
Robert Conrad (Jim West) The Wild Wild West
Ted Markland (Reno) The High Chaparral
Robert Fuller (Jess Harper) Laramie

4107096,4,B003BLPEHE,"An excellent series that consistently provided great characters and solid stories throughout it's run.

The packaging is excellent and easy to use and keeps the discs safe. The quality of the videos was excellent. The picture was sharp and clear. In one episode, ""Retired Gangster,"" there is a scene where you can actually see a small bug walking across the camera lens.

BC was one of my childhood heroes from the fifties. To my young friends and me, Dan Matthews was a bigger hero to us than Superman or Tarzan.

Dan Matthews was a 'believable' hero. He was a down-to-earth cop who went after the bad guys, comforted the victims, and heaven help anyone who threatened a child on his watch!

And, as children, we saw right thru that 'rough, gruff, bull-dog' exterior... barking out orders. woof woof woof... and saw a heart of gold. We loved him unconditionally and didn't care that he had a broken nose, a bit of baldness going on, a big pudgy tummy, or a huge dented scar on his forehead that looked like something left from a childhood accident.

BC also taught us to know the difference between himself and his character as he always ended his show with, ""This is Broderick Crawford, see you next week."" And he always gave us a safety tip. (To this day, I have never gotten a ticket for speeding.)

What is neat about those old shows now is that they show parts of California the way they were back in the fifties... unfinished highway, open undeveloped land and other things.... and it is fun to notice the prices of things... .69 cents for steak, 12,500 for a home, or .16 cents for men's shirts. I also understand that some of those buildings used in the show still exist today.

It is also fun to watch sometimes because of all the young actors who appeared on various HP episodes and went on to be stars, plus some of the scripts were written by various people (Gene Roddenberry for one).

I just wish that MGM could be persuaded into cleaning up and releasing the rest of the seasons.",1346716800,5,2081,4.845070422535211

I collect the offbeat , cult and barely remembered films and TV shows of the 1950s and 60s. I love Highway Patrol as its one of the timeless shows that required real actors  . Good script writers and location shoots . Im not bashing todays epic ( yeah!) TV shows and movies with their massive CGI budgets and actors that look like they need to eat a cracker or a real meal . I met Mr. Crawford in NJ ( early 1980s )after he had done a show at a dinner theatre . He was as described by many gruff in manner and speech. When all was said and done he grinned and said, you want me to do the sign off don't you ? We looked as he pulled a old police style mic from his jacket pocket and in grand style said, 2150 to headquarters ,2150 to headquarters . We shook hands and he signed autographs but nothing could top Mr. Crawford giving his old Highway Patrol call sign.

4107130,5,B003BLPEHE,"I have watched Amazon for many months hoping Highway Patrol would become available. I remember this program when it first came out on TV back in the 1950'sand it is one of my most memorable programs.

The Amazon description of this item indicates that the DVD's are duplicated ( individually burned ) on DVD R discs.  Any blank or recorded DVD R Discs I have ever bought or have  seen usually have a light purple  color on the recorded side.  The ones I recieved with this set do not have that but instead are silver color which indicates to me they may very well be factory  "" replicated ""  ( professionally manufactured )  Discs just like  the ones you get with most popular DVD's.

I have watched several of the discs so far and I am very impressed with the picture and sound quality.  It is possible that some enhancement technique has been applied when the transfer from the archived films to the digital mastering of these programs. You might be surprised that it is more than possible the picture quality you get from these discs could be better than the picture quality of the original broadcasts of these appeared on your TV back in the 1950's !  There have been a lot of improvements in TV's since then and those improvements come through even when watching original programs like this that were made in  "" Glorious Monochrome ""  ( Black & White ).

Although you can not expect full range stereo sound from these DVD's as you would with todays movie DVD's, the sound quality is quite good and faithful to the original.  There is no noticable squelching of silent spots in these programs as you may have heard on digital reproductions of early films and poorly stored original movies and tv programs.

Speaking of silent spots, the primary thing I remember about Dan Matthews was  "" 10 - 4 ""  LOL. I did not remember his fast talking and rapid fire telephone calls, I guess they had to squeeze as much information and dialog into the time alloted for the program. I never noticed it back then but of course I was much younger.

Concerning the playability of these DVD's, I have tried them on a budget $29.95 DVD player and a $179.95 DVD player that I must have bought about 10 years ago.  They both play these DVD's just fine. Out of curiousity I also tried these discs on 2 different PC's and they play just fine there too !

For anyone having the desire to have this set of Highway Patrol DVD's I would not hesitate to recommend them.

I seldom spend this amount of money for  a DVD set of old TV Programs but this is one that I was waiting for so it is well worth the price to me.

I don't have to go into the story plots, etc. as I feel anyone reading this or the many other favorable reviews here can well remember Highway Patrol with Broderick Crawford.  The Original  "" 10 - 4 "" guy !

Many thanks to MGM and Amazon for making these available.

4107131,5,B003BLPEHE,"These discs are the holy grail of early police tv shows. I grew up watching Highway Patrol, along with Sky King and Superman on Saturday morning TV. These shows are as good as I remember, and a nostalgic look into the early 50s. Great shots of California scenery and the iconic Highway Patrol Buicks(and Oldsmobiles, and Fords). Hard to believe that Crawford was 44 when the series was shot; he looks a good ten years older. I guess 50 is really the new 40 these days. There are a few oddities; when a car crashes down a hillside, the car going down the hillside was clearly not the one that was at the top of the hill. Occasionally you'll see different cars in pursuit of the bad guys and so on. Chalk them up to a time when audiences weren't quite so sharp eyed for such continuity errors.

4107134,4,B003BLPEHE,"Released in 1955, Highway Patrol is a crime/police drama known to audiences of all ages through heavy syndication.  Broderick Crawford was the star of the show playing burly Dan Matthews, the tough-as-nails chief of the otherwise un-named Highway Patrol.  Seeing and hearing Dan Matthews, you knew he was in complete control and would have the bad guys apprehended by the end of the half hour show.

The show had realistic story lines and equipment, courtesy of the California Highway Patrol.  One interesting thing about the show involved the Buick coupe patrol cars, which were actual CHP vehicles.  Buick had actually produced a custom patrol car for the CHP using the the more powerful 236 horsepower V8 from its more upscale models in the entry level 2 door Special coupe. The big V8 in the light couple produced a real high performance police car for that era.  Minus the CHP lettering, those cars and uniforms were the real thing.

Tight realistic stories, police jargon, real police cars and props kept the attention of young boys who one day dreamed of being law enforcement officers.  Times have changed and so has police equipment, but these stories are still entertaining and a neat bit of nostalgia for those of us growing up in the late 1950's and early 60's.

Filmed in black and white, the video and sound quality of the disks are very good considering the age of the material.  About the only thing I would dock the overall package for is a lack of extras.  The package is remarkably sparse without so much as episode or air-date information.

Overall, a fine but spartan release of a fine golden Age police show.  Hopefully MGM will see fit to include some extra's for those of us interested in those old TV shows that played while we were growing up.",1296432000,12,1769,4.741830065359477

On the other hand, if you recall the '50's and early '60's as a time of sanity and 'the way it should be' in regard to fashion, cars, and macho, these episodes will take you back there for at least 30 minutes.  Broderick Crawford may have been a human scotch recycling machine but his tough guy-in charge persona is wonderful.

4107142,5,B003BLPEHE,"Highway Patrol has always been one of my favorites. It was the first series, together with The Cisco Kid, I ever watched in my life, bringing good memories of years gone by. It was the mid-fifties, I was twelve and living in Buenos Aires, Argentina. My family had an old black and white tv set. I could hardly wait for the daily double presentation starting at 0600pm (The Cisco Kid) followed by Highway Patrol, at 0630pm. I really enjoyed those shows and always wandered what they would sound like in English, since they were all dubbed into Spanish. The famous Broderick Crawford's quote ""10-4"" was translated for ""entendido"". I was so happy to find out that the first season had been released on DVD, and that my truthful supplier Amazon.com had it for sale. I was eager counting the days for its delivery. Unfortunately, although advertised as ""Highway Patrol - The Complete First Season"" with a total of 10 DVDs, somebody goofed at Amazon.com and shipped me an abridged version composed of only four DVDs, covering only a few episodes. I wonder what the first episode looked like.

Nevertheless, don't let this mishap bother you. Although in black and white it still is great, one of the best shows in American television history. Good to see familiar faces such as Stuart Whitman, a guest in one the episodes, later a regular patrolman seated next to Broderick Crawford. So, rush and buy it. You will definetely enjoy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highway-Patrol-Season-1/dp/B003BLPEHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highway Patrol Season 1</a>",1289433600,5,1592,5.317460317460317
4107143,1,B003BLPEHE,"I've waited a long time for this release.  You could say over fifty years, from when I played with my Dan Matthews plastic gun and sported an enamel Highway Patrol badge.  But I didn't know about DVDs back when I was eight.  My parents had no TV then and I had to stay with my grandparents to see Superman, Sea Hunt, Highway Patrol, etc.  So I was pleased to see the show finally available on amazon and ordered it over two months ago when dispatch was promised in less than two weeks.  The idea of made-to-order DVDs seemed a good idea for items where demand may be unpredictable, and I was happy to see reviews from those who had actually RECEIVED the set to reassure me that the picture quality was from 35mm masters.

Since then I have responded three times to amazon's e-mails apologising for delays and asking me to confirm that I still wanted it.  Yes, I certainly did.  The latest, today, tells me that I can now expect delivery by November 22.  Let's hope.

A polite personal note from amazon a few days ago apologized again for the delay but offered no explanation for why a so-called ""manufactured-on-demand"" item should be delayed so long.  I might have suspected some sort of problem with rights or quality issues with the original being copied but some lucky customers have received theirs already.  The guy with a DVD-writer can't have been on vacation that long.  What is going on?

I look forward to posting a positive review when it arrives.  Ten-four.

A couple of the episodes had a minor sound or picture glitch, but it did not ruin the episode. Can't wait for the additional seasons to be released.

The quality was excellent, Broderick Crawford was fantastic as a state cop, but the best part is that Hollywood did not portray the police as thugs or criminals and put a very positive view of the those that protect and serve. I highly recommend this product. Although the actors are gone and the cars over 50 years old, the values, citizenship and respect still ring true.

I was familiar with this series as I watched it as a child and I still like it. Hopefully, it won't be too long before Season 2 appears.

After watching the show , I immediately got on the internet and started digging up all the information I could find on it. First of all , any nostalgia buff will find this show hard to ignore . The old vehicles , homes , gas stations , ect. make you want to jump through your TV screen and spend a few months walking around on the set of the show , riding in those old vehicles or eating at one of those old cafes . I bought one season on an online auction site but the audio/video quality was pretty bad . The season 1 from Amazon is terrific ! Video quality is easily 9.5 out of 10 . I will definitely buy seasons 2 , 3 , and 4 if and when they are available . A+ !",1286668800,4,795,3.824242424242424

crime from murder to excessive speeding on our highways.. ( and always with a safety tip at the end). Seldom do you actually see a violent act such as a blow to the head of an innocent or blood spilling out from a gun shot etc.
I suppose the fact that I grew up in Southern California at the time of Highway Patrol filming makes me a little nostalgic of the area and of simpler times.

4107152,5,B003BLPEHE,"My grandfather was a county sheriff in the 1950s, riding high in a 1954 Ford sedan and catching bad guys with neither a spotlight nor a gumball machine, just a hand held red light. He told me a story once of going on a call to a guy that had murdered his wife. When grandpa got there, the wife was dead and the guy was sitting in his rocker with shotgun on lap.

""Are you going to shoot me?"" Grandpa asked.

""Nope, I got her and now I'm waiting for her boyfriend,"" he said.

Broderick Crawford, one of the most distinctive American actors of the 1950s, never acted out anything like this in ""Highway Patrol,"" the great series that ran on American TV from 1955-59. Crawford, who was head man at the highway patrol, usually barked at officers to get him a '58 Buick Roadmaster or to get the bad guys. He was a mean, tough SOB and a macho man in an era when such men ruled the roost on American TV.

Crawford was also an accomplished film actor, having won an Oscar during the crime drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-King-s-Men/dp/B000BITV92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the King's Men</a>&nbsp;where he played the other side of the fence -- a master criminal. He also played another sort of lawman in 1977's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Private-Files-of-J-Edgar-Hoover/dp/B000059ZXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover</a>&nbsp;replete with the FBI chief's relationship with a boyfriend in the bureau. This Broderick Crawford was a far cry from the tough sheriff on ""Highway Patrol.""

Another reason to buy this, aside from Broderick Crawford cult of personality, is to see some authentic 1950s American cars and scenes. Crime films made today, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Confidential/dp/B001CN2WXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A.

So bust your budget and pick up the first year of ""Highway Patrol"" for a view of America you won't see today. There are still crime dramas on TV but, after you watch this one, you'll see their highly stylized visions don't match the realities you can find in older ones.",1285286400,6,2555,5.986301369863014

When looking for their suspect, they never mention the make of the car being pursued--just a two tone sedan with the number of the license plate. Broderik Crawford is rough, tough and a no nonsense type of guy. No meranda rights mentioned here just the take down of the criminal. A few familiar faces in the shows like Clint Eastwood or Guy Williams before he played Zorro --probably  unknowns at the time. Great shows and quite entertaining besides. Looking forward to seasons 2, 3, and 4. The little sayings by Crawford at the end of show are a little dated, but still  priceless .Only one thing I noticed, no air dates listed.

As a previous poster already said, the majority of these episodes appear to come from 35mm prints instead of 16mm TV syndication copies. The only one that doesn't look that great is the episode ""Gambling"" from Disc 2. I'm not so sure that's from 35mm, and if it is, it may be from a multiple generation dupe.

The only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is the lack of a soft telecine. For whatever the reason, MGM decided to hard-telecine the video. It's 2010 for crying out loud. Only fully progressive telecining should be going on nowadays.",1284163200,4,634,4.56140350877193
4107160,4,B003BLPEHE,"Watched this show weekday afternoons after school when I was ten and really didn't appreciate the adult storylines.  Fury, Gene Autry and the Three Stooges were more my level.  Now, some fifty years later I was remembering the opening theme and it drew my attention back to the series.  I popped the first disc into the DVD player and on a sixty-inch screen was catapaulted back.  The producers chose automobiles that would become classics and seeing them now in their prime is pure enjoyment.  The quality of the picture is better than any bootleg copies and immensely better than I remember seeing on our 19 inch Zenith. Screen writers must have had to write 35 minutes worth of dialog for each 25 minute episode because Broderick Crawford's machine-gun paced deliveries leave Sergeant Joe Friday sounding like Forrest Gump.  As enjoyable as a ride with Peabody and Serman on the Wayback Machine.
Oh, go ahead and get it!
Follow Up Weeks Later....Okay,just saw Guy Williams (Disney's Zorro) play in a couple of episodes before his Caped Crusader days with Walt.  Without a mustache and without many lines, he still looked like Zorro until he ran down a hill in one scene.  Hate to say it but he ran like a girl. Broke my heart.  The cape must have hidden his gait in Zorro.  Clint Eastwood was in one episode as a motorcycle gang member. He made Crawford's Day.",1283817600,17,1363,4.713080168776371
4107161,5,B003BLPEHE,"This was a 'blind buy' for me as I was not born when the series premiered and never saw it in reruns. I do remember my father talking about it as he watched it in its original run.

I received my set 1 week after I placed my order (using free shipping option). The audio/video quality is better than I expected a 1955 TV series would be. I've seen other series of the same vintage (mid-1950's) on DVD that did not look as good. All discs play well. (by the way, these DVD-R's will work only in a ""play-only"" device such as a stand-alone DVD player or a computer with a DVD-ROM drive, not a set top DVD recorder or the usual DVD burner drive).

The outdoor scenes were shot on location, not in a studio backlot and one gets a fascinating look at a mid-century Americana that is long gone, to say nothing of all the vintage autos you will see.

Broderick's Matthews character is gruff, straightforward and no nonsense. No suspects demanding their 'rights' or politically correct sensitivities here.

The list price was a bit too steep for me, but when Amazon put it on sale at 25% off, that clinched the deal. Now we will just hope for seasons 2-4 and maybe some other ZIV shows (such as the Emmy nominated ""I Led 3 Lives"") in the future.",1282780800,82,1236,4.337662337662338
