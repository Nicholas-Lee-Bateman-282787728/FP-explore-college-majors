559675,5,6303104576,"People assume that anime is only sci-fi or action-oriented.  Not so.
They Were 11 (my favorite anime flick) is proof positive that anime can be character driven within the mystery genre.  Buy this film!",1023148800,2,202,4.911764705882353
559676,5,6303104576,"This movie is based off of manga by Hagio Moto.  The final part of the elite Cosmo Academy requires ten cadets who have never seen or met one another to survive as a team for 53 days on a space craft.  So trust and teamwork are a very imporant part of the exam.  However, problems start to arise when the group discovers that they have eleven members on their team and that somebody is purposely sabotagin things.  But who is it?  And why are they doing it?  The question then becomes can they survive as a team for 53 days when they don't trust one another.",983404800,9,558,4.216981132075472
559677,4,6303104576,"This is in many ways a classic ""who dunnit,"" and most of the pleasure of this movie is in discovering everyone's secrets, most  especially the identity of the mysterious ""number 11."" The movie  is quite involved with a complex, but not overly confusing, plot and  surprisingly well developed characters. The pace is well chosen, frenetic  when necessary and yet quite thoughtful when appropriate. My only concern  was a few blatant translation errors. Two characters are referred to as  ""Hermaphrodites"" because they have not become either sex yet. The  proper term is ""Androgonite."" Similarly, one of the characters  calls himself a ""cyborg,"" despite having no technological parts  whatsoever. Other than that, ""They Were 11"" is a very solid film  with consistently clean and fluid animation. Even the voices are well  chosen for the parts, and the dubbing is very high quality.
A constant  problem with these kinds of movies is that in theory, the ""odd man  out"" could be anyone, you can generally eliminate everyone from  suspicion except for one or two people within the first ten minutes. While  I was able to quickly dismiss several of the characters, I was genuinely in  the dark until the final revelation. While I did find the end somewhat  trite, with everyone getting a happy ending, I still enjoyed the movie  immensely.
The largest flaw in the movie was the characterization of  Frol. I can see where the director was trying to create a highly  contradictory character to prepare for the revelation about her true  nature, but to me the character just came off as aggressive and nave,  almost stupid. Some of the other characters were also weak (you have to  wonder how people with such passive personalies can make it into such an  exclusive university) but in general, I enjoyed the diversity of the  characters. The characters greatly add to the replay value of the movie,  which is also unusual for a mystery.",965779200,11,1926,4.940625
7837425,5,6303104576,A clever and wonderfully written mystery. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Such a great film! I cannot recommend this highly enough! Do yourself a favor and seek it out!,1435017600,,185,4.166666666666667
7837426,5,6303104576,"Not a typical sci-fi story, TW11 is an interesting take on a closed-room mystery.  There's supposed to be ten students taking their space academy exam, but when they get to the location, they have eleven.  The designs are obviously old-school and the hair never moves, but it's still not the worst animation I've seen.  It did it's best to be modern-for the 80s-in all aspects, especially the cultures and norms but didn't quite succeed.  (The main character accepts everyone, and the ones who do look down on others are shown as wrong.  At the same time, everyone feels it's natural for the hereditary prince to take command.)",1406332800,,627,4.822429906542056
7837427,4,6303104576,"Here's the scenario: ten aspiring space cadets are sent to a derelict ship as part of their entry exam... only to discover that there is (gasp!) an eleventh person!

Yes, ""They Were Eleven"" has a pretty simple premise, but it manages to wring a surprising amount of suspense from the simple set-up. While some of the characters are never fleshed out enough, the ones that are are well-developed (if not always likable), and there's a genuine sense of suspense over what exactly is going on.

As mentioned above, ten space cadets are sent to a derelict ship floating in space, where they must survive for the next couple months without outside help. Additionally, the ship is riddled with about-to-explode bombs, infected with a deadly disease, and is in a slowly-decaying orbit. I wonder how many people die during these tests.

But they immediately discover that there are eleven cadets instead of ten. No one knows who Number Eleven is, or why they are there.

Their de facto leader Mayan immediately suspects mild-mannered Tad, who seems to be strangely familiar with the ship. And as the days pass, the cadets' suspicions about each other grow -- even as the ship's orbit decays, threatening to unleash the deadly disease that killed its original crew. If they can't work together, none of them will survive.

""They Were Eleven"" is a good example of a simple story concept done well. It's just a straightforward whodunnit set in space, with some mystery and the occasional plot twist. You have no idea who Number Eleven actually is or what they're doing until the finale, where everything clicks into logical place.

The tension keeps building up as the characters get more and more paranoid, to the point where the slightest action can send them on a screaming witch hunt. But they also show us the good side of their personalities, such as when one of their number is near-fatally injured, and everyone clusters around to make sure he'll be all right.

The one scene that DIDN'T make sense was a weird comic relief scene where people start throwing pies at each other. It felt weird and disconnected.

About half the characters are pretty well-fleshed out, but without too much clumsy exposition -- we have the quiet, increasingly confused Tad, the haughty King Mayan, bratty aristocrat Doricas, the scaled giant Knu and the laid-back adventurer Amazon. However, some of the characters aren't fleshed out, like Chaco, Tasta and Toto. They're just blanks.

And Frol's character is so aggressive and overemotional that I can't buy that he/she could pass any kind of elite test. But the slow-building relationship with Tad is quite interesting, as is Frol's quest to achieve manhood or independence (which are synonymous on his/her planet).

""They Were Eleven"" is a strong, suspenseful little sci-fi story, with solid '90s animation and some well-developed characters. Some flaws, but not nearly enough to keep it from being enjoyable.",1354752000,,2938,4.989775051124744
7837428,5,6303104576,"This imo is one of the best anime movies ever created,harking back to a simpler and perhaps better time of anime goodness. The characters are all unique,the story is entertaining and the ending along with an added epilogue for each of the characters is a very refreshing happy ending at that.

They don't make em like this anymore. A very rare and unique piece,I can't recommend it enough!",1330041600,,389,4.720588235294118
7837429,5,6303104576,A really entertaining short movie. You're never sure who is the odd man out and you end up guessing about it over and over. Has a nice ending too. This is another anime that should be part of any collection and the price it right too.,1326412800,,234,4.108695652173913
7837430,5,6303104576,"I remember I bought this movie as a Used VHS copy from Blockbuster. It was a lucky find because I had no idea what an amazing film this truly is.

Each character is unique and memorable, and I even feel emotionally connected to them.

I was probably 12 years old when I first watched it, and I remember it was on my birthday, and I was bawling in tears because I found the story so sad. It's basically about what people do when they are faced with the fear of death.

I would compare the quality and breadth of this film to Grave of the Fireflies, although perhaps They Were 11 is not nearly as sad.

I even watched this film with a Japanese friend. She was not a huge fan of anime, thinking it was more for children; however, she said she loved the film. She hadn't seen or even heard of it before, but she found it quite spectacular, which says something I think coming from an actual Japanese person.

Do I recommend this film? I strongly recommend this film. It has a literary quality to it much like Lord of the Flies. Only think of it as taking place in Outer Space with Space Cadets instead of Children, with a hint of Agatha Christie because there is a secret one, perhaps a ghost, who is not supposed to be there on the mission with them.

I love this film! And I could not see myself parting with it as I can watch it over and over.",1325289600,3,1342,4.162162162162162
7837431,5,6303104576,This is a classic anime an incredible story line with a perfect plot twist. Part of the reason I love anime.,1305676800,,108,4.190476190476191
7837432,5,6303104576,"The story is about Ten young space cadets who are put onto a decommissioned spaceship as their final test. If they pass this test, their lifelong dreams of being valued people in their respective societies will come true. Their orders are to survive as long as they can with what they have. However, once they arrive at the decommissioned ship, they find that their crew has gained an eleventh member.
As the days pass, the eleven cadets must deal with their suspicions of each other as well as the sudden knowledge that the spaceship is in a decaying orbit around a star, which is causing the temperature on the ship to rise. With this rise in temperature, a sickness begins to spread among the crew as they work to stabilize their orbit and determine who among them is the spy.
This anime shows different people from different back grounds and races living in one environment, fighting one problem after another, which was the biggest one of them ""suspicion"". feeling the tension between the crew grows over time with no leads to who is that Eleventh person makes you sympathize with each one of them.
for a 1986 movie the Art is an aye candy, but it might be just me who like this style of art, but as i compared it to other classic anime from that time, ""they were Eleven"" was as good as it could be.
for the OST unfortunately i'm bad at remembering them from movies, but the ending song ""Boku no Honesty"" by Shinichiro Kawakami was a good closing to the anime, a nice quite song.
it's been a while since i'v watched a movie as good as this one, i pretty much recommend it to anyone who like classic space anime.",1261353600,2,1616,4.462837837837838

7837434,4,6303104576,I liked this picure overall.  The tension of the situation had me rooting for the team to make it to the end of their challenge.  I certainly couldn't guess who the extra person was.  I do think I might have enjoyed a couple of female characters to even out the boys club but oh well.,1179619200,4,284,4.127272727272727
