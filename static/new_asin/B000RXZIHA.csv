8202973,3,B000RXZIHA,"This excellent social history is flawed by a very spotty technical overview. Like ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" this film's portrayal of the socio-economic effects of military technology is concise, complete and informed by a wide spectrum of political and academic opinion. The Juxtaposition of the likes of  Noam Chomsky and John Milius, or Tony Benn and the senior editor of ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine is informative and entertaining.

The technical narration starts off well with decent summaries of the development of the Gatling and Maxim guns, and their respective international impact. After World War I the film drops almost all interest in crew served weapons, and is completely focused on light personal weapons from the MP18 through the Kalashnikov. The latter part of the series is mostly concerned  with the AK-47 and the weapon's effect on postwar world politics. Towards the end there are also very quick looks at helicopter gunship tactics in Vietnam, cheap automatics used by contemporary LA gangs, and the experimental ""Metalstorm"" guns in Australia. With the exception of the ""Metalstorm"" segment, this structure served the thesis of cheap, plentiful weapons empowering post colonial guerillas and urban gangsters. This is interesting but by no means a complete history of the subject.

In the end, I had two big problems with the film; First, The history of the AK was significantly distorted beyond mere editing errors. Second, the narrative omits or glosses over too many important figures and weapons. There is little or no mention of John M. Browning, the BAR, the legendary M2 .50 cal, the Bren, the FN/FAL, Eugene Stoner, and on and on.  This was bad enough, but the suggestion Mikhail Kalashnikov invented not just the AK, but the Assault Rifle concept was beyond sloppy and very nearly fraudulent. The film shows the AK as a response to  the German MP-38 and MP-40 submachinegun. The film features extensive interviews with Kalashnikov, and implies intermediate ammunition, and the light, fully automatic SMG/rifle hybrid or ""Assault Rifle"" were all his idea.  The film does not mention, not even once, the very successful German MP-44 Sturmgewehr. Given the MP-44 was a light, fully automatic rifle with the distinctive intermediate ammo, pistol grip, and curved 30 round magazine of the AK; Given the weapon saw much active service two and three years before the first AK rolled off a factory line; given the word Sturmgewehr itself means ""Assault Rifle"" in German, the root of Kalashnikov's idea seems obvious: The template for the AK-47 was the MP-44. I can't see why these important facts were omitted unless it was to give a popular audience the notion that the ""great proletarian weapon's"" roots were purely Soviet. That choice is fair showmanship, but lousy history and it disturbs me.

Portraying the Assault Rifle as a Soviet concept, rather than a brilliant, rugged,  Soviet adaptation of German Technology, makes me unwilling to recommend this film to viewers who don't know anything about firearms. However, viewers who have the background to see through the flaws of the second half will find it a useful and entertaining introduction to the social, political and economic impact of automatic weapons from the late industrial revolution to the present.",1325721600,2,3293,5.186440677966102
