8535463,3,B00005R1NJ,"Ok, here's the reason I give this DVD such a strange review.
First off, if you're looking for a really dirty Penthouse video, this might not be it. Out of 7 scenes, 2 are really spicy (borderling hardcore w/o the close-ups). The other 5 are so surprisingly lame they make Playboy videos look raunchy.
Most of these scenes look like girl/girl shoots from past videos that never made it past editing. The last scene appears to be the only new tandem that was filmed.
The girls involved are hot, but the director must have been on xanex or something stronger. You can see the girls hesitate A LOT. The girls ask each other questions (about god knows what) and talk to the director.
The quality of women involved is very high, but still. Lorissa McComas never removes her bottoms ... never even gets off the horse she's sitting on. Her partner keeps looking at her like, ""you know, you can come down whenever you want."" Roxanne Michaels, who longer does softcore videos and movies, keeps asking her girl if what she's doing is ok. The late Leslie Glass, a true beauty, is sooo bored during her shoot, it looks as if she's making fun of the director while the shoot is going on. AND, she gets something stuck in her hair and freaks out for a moment. Leslie and her girlfriend are made to walk around in circles, lightly kissing and touching (and getting dizzy, I'm sure). Florida porn star/stripper Jesse James is in this dvd, too. Needless to say, she does not hold back. Her scene is hotter than hell, but looks to be shot on Hi-8 by one of her amutuer photographer friends. Oh well ...
Overall, the two scenes I mentioned are the only reason to see this release and give it any points at all. If you want a swanky dvd from Penthouse, you go with the All New Pet Workout or Tropical Spice. You simply can't go wrong with either of those.",1014163200,20,1834,4.445103857566766
