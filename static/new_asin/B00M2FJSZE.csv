6554325,1,B00M2FJSZE,This is literally just a repackage of the volume 1 DVD released 5 years ago! And it's more expensive! Don't waste your money.,1409011200,23,125,4.478260869565218

6554330,5,B00M2FJSZE,"Flapjack is just a wonderful show.  I suspect it never caught on as it wasn't on Adult Swim and was sort of a ""not quite for kids"" but not violent or as crass as the popular Adult Swim shows of the day.  But that's a shame, because it's charming, hilarious, artistic, weird in the best way, and clearly a labor of love with its own distinct flavor.  This disc only has five (double) episodes, but they're good ones and this is very enjoyable.  You -can- watch (currently) all of Flap on Hulu so if this DVD whets your whistle but isn't enough to completely satisfy, check it out there.",1454112000,6,585,4.339449541284404

6554333,5,B00M2FJSZE,Unfortunately it's not a whole season's worth of episodes but rather a compilation. Still worth the price though,1451865600,3,112,5.277777777777778

6554335,5,B00M2FJSZE,"As disappointed as I am that a full on release was ever made of this series, I'm SO pleased that I could find this and at least have some enjoyment out of my favorite, underrated, under appreciated, cartoon network show!",1447891200,3,220,4.525

6554339,5,B00M2FJSZE,I have no idea why this cartoon ever stopped being made... it is so freakin' funny.  I think it was intended for an older audience.  Reminds me of the strange junk that would happen on old school Ren and Stimpy. :-),1437004800,5,215,4.219512195121951
6554340,4,B00M2FJSZE,"Great, silly fun! Picture and sound quality are good. There are some cool extras. I always enjoy seeing the voice actors and the evolution of the characters from concept to finished animation. No booklet or any frills, but a good value for the price. I knocked off a star because when you put the disc in, instead of the main menu, you get several commercials for other DVDs. Annoying!",1435881600,3,385,4.594202898550725

8669862,1,B00M2FJSZE,"This DVD is basically ""The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, Vol. 1"" from 2009 but with a different DVD case, that's right, CN re-released a DVD from 2009 with a different case.

Same Episodes.
Same Special Features.

The ONLY benefit to buying this version is that it's slightly cheaper.

I wish CN would release entire seasons of their shows on Blu-ray instead of slapping a few episodes on a cheap DVD.",1506211200,,408,4.8
