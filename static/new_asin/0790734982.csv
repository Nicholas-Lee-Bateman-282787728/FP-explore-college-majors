7791423,4,0790734982,"The Reagan defense-spendin' years brought us this flick about a 2nd-rate arms dealer (Eddie Muntz - Chase) down on his luck who happens to be in the wrong place at the right time to capitalize on a $300 million dollar combat drone airplane contract. Problem is, the plane suffers from a few design flaws and the USA doesn't want to buy it. But there's money to be made.

The special effects are only studio-quality, much like we saw in many movies of the 1980's (Aliens of 1979 being an enjoyable exception). Standard Chase humor here and I like Gregory Hines as the troubled arms dealer discovering his spiritual side. During his struggles with his new-found Faith, Hines has to take a flamethrower to a 1974-or-so Monte Carlo to resolve a dispute.

There's the banana-republic military dictator who's interested in the drone (the Peacemaker) and Sigourney Weaver. Great cameo appearance by Richard Libertini who I enjoyed in Fletch, Fletch Lives and The In-Laws. Libertini is an arms dealer, based on the real-life arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi who dated Mary Hart (Miss Million Dollar Legs herself).

I'd give the movie 3.5 stars, because of the nice, odd touches like the Pep Boys automotive commercial (Manny, Moe and Jack!) that shows up on one of the computer monitors. Though not his best movie, this is one of Chase's better efforts, unlike Modern Problems or Nothing But Trouble (ouch). Not the greatest movie in the world, but a little fun, especially when Chase turns the tables on a would-be robber. Listen for the classic subtle Chase insults to his arms clients at the beginning (""you smell like you smell now"") and his twists of the cliche's (""what's a place like this doing around a girl like that?""). Kind of a different film, but some interesting footage of Reagan's defense build-up speeches.",975369600,10,1810,4.8892508143322475
