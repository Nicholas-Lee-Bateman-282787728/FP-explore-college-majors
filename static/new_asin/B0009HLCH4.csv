8060994,5,B0009HLCH4,"Before I start this review, I should warn the reader that I've only watched this movie through once, and I didn't look at the subtitles as I was watching it.  Therefore, since my ability to understand spoken Russian is not exactly great, I may have missed a lot of dialogue that might have otherwise made me give the film a lower rating.  But as it was, the movie was really enjoyable.  It was an older movie, which fortunately meant that there wasn't a lot of stuff in it which was objectionable.  I'm not sure that I could have had my 6-year-old in the room with me as I was watching it, but so far as I recall, my 13-year-old would have been fine.",1401667200,4,650,4.260162601626016
