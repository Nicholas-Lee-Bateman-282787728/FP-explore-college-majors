The subject matter is compelling and prods the viewer to think about the situations dealt with in Singapore during the sixties. Don Hany and Joan Chen as the leads are capable of carrying the series in any direction. Great cinematography, writing  and acting. Very believable!",1421107200,8,358,4.868852459016393
6776485,5,B00OYT0ZM6,A wonderful series. It is a shame that HBO is not moving forward with a second season.,1417824000,3,86,4.117647058823529
6776486,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"I read somewhere that this was the first series that HBO Asia bankrolled. If so its a pretty darn good debut effort.

The series is, in effect, a crime/detective style arrangement. The premise is that a private investigations agency is run by a chap named Winston (played in flashback in a couple of episodes by Russell Wong). Prior to the first episode he is killed and his wife (played by Joan Chen) decides to keep the agency open. Partly to support herself and secondly as an excuse to look for her husbands killer. She is assisted by her secretary (Pamelyn Chee) and sporadically by a former Australian soldier named Sam Callaghan (Don Hany) and his local business partner. The first episode introduces a range of continuing characters  among them the local CIA Agent and the local CIA station chief, the local triad gang, an Australian journalist, local police chief and a love interest for the Sam (Claire, played by Maeve Dermody). There are other characters that are regular but more on the periphery and of course there are those that appear only once or twice.

What makes the series work is that there are a couple of threads which wind their way all the way through the show and a couple of new ones that start up within the first few episodes. Interspersed with that the series deals  of course  with a range of cases that the investigative agency takes on. The intelligent inter-weaving of these and the way the characters move forwards are two of the series biggest strengths.

Another factor in the shows favour is that it is set in Singapore around the time of Malaysian independence and in which Singapore was going to join in initially. There are various factions wanting this, or not wanting it, and there are MI6 and CIA operatives working to agendas that don't fully correlate. This adds an element of espionage to some of the stories, allows some action and also some political tension to seep into the storylines and that broadens the palette from which the show can paint its picture.

Lastly the differing cultures and languages of the population of Singapore adds some spice. This means there are times when subtitles are used but they appear only occasionally.

Filmed in Semarang on Java the production values of this series are quite good. It is obvious at times the recycling of sets and street scenes but you expect that in such a series. The production crew has tried to mix things up by having dockside scenes, urban scenes and used some natural settings nicely. I even liked how they incorporated the odd good storm into the story.

This is a series that youll probably return to and re-watch. And while it wasn't filmed there if youve ever been to Singapore youll probably find this interesting on a different level.

Heartily recommended.",1459728000,,2776,4.764583333333333

6776498,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"Rich in 60s music and vibes, this noir series set in Singapore instantly draws viewers in with fast-paced action and plots upon sub-plots. Don Hany portrays Sam Callaghan, an Aussie businessman with a dark past. Sam's neighbor Patricia Cheng (played by the talented Joan Chen, who's always terrific) seeks his help in keeping up her husband's detective agency after her spouse is killed while on a case. Of course it's not just ONE case that brings Sam on board,  because so much needs attention in 1964 Singapore, from gangs and politics to the welfare of children and missing persons. This is a mystery series with nonstop intrigue, storylines that flow, and the flavor of a distinctive era as a country teeters on the cusp of change. Ten one-hour episodes on three disks (subtitles available) plus a bonus behind-the-scenes feature, all with excellent cinematography that feels more like a theatrical film, add up to a top-rated viewer experience. A second season would have been wonderful--can the detective agency really stay afloat?-- but the HBO Asia producers decided against it, so thankfully, Acorn Media has brought the series home for mystery fans looking for international, vintage flair.",1432166400,2,1201,5.158974358974359
6776499,3,B00OYT0ZM6,"My wife and I have been watching a lot of British mystery/spy films of late.  This one is actually from Australia, produced by HBO Asia, and was purchased largely because of the reviews it got on Amazon.  The first episode of the ten in the series was very good.  It introduced Sam Callaghan (played by Don Hany) as a  former soldier who ended up in Singapore in the 1960's who eventually began working for Patricia Cheng (played by Joan Chen) who tries to keep the Cheng Detective Agency afloat after here husband is killed... ostensibly by the local mob.  Hany was ""cool"" and there were some interesting fight scenes which added to the action.  But after that episode, the series devolves into a simple procedural.  Not being familiar with the history of Singapore, I got lost in the politics of the time or the reason any of it happened.  And it was not really explained.  They showed riots in the street and explosions, but why did that happen?  The show did not really explain the reason.  I also lost complete interest in the relationship between the obviously intentionally stubbly - meant to be cool - who only works when he has to - Callaghan and the elegant Claire Simpson (Maeve Dermody) who usually appears at embassy parties in ball gowns.  Other than the fact that she was also Australian (and her husband left her alone to travel the orient on business) I didn't understand the attraction.  Maybe it was a simple case of women loving the bad boy.  Regardless, I gave up after episode 4; I didn't make it through the entire series.  Those 4 episodes were ""OK"", but I don't recommend it highly at all.",1429747200,3,1614,4.594405594405594

6776504,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"SERANGOON ROAD, (2013).  This television series, a noir crime drama set in the stunning city of Singapore, was made as HBO Asias first original production by Australias ABCTV.  In it, the locally born Sam Callaghan (played by Australian actor Don Hany) agrees to help his neighbor Patricia Cheng, played by Joan Chen, help  run her detective agency, inherited after the murder of her husband.  He is then pulled into a dangerous world of Chinese gangs and international politics. This private detective procedural features a diverse cast set against an exotic backdrop: 1960s Singapore, a secretive, crime-ridden city at a crossroads.  I received this as a review copy. The box set consists of three discs, ten episodes, 10 hours of entertainment plus a behind-the-scenes featurettenine minutes, production notes by series creator Paul Barron, a photo gallery, and, thank goodness, subtitles, else what would we do with the Babel of languages and accents of Singapore, long a center of the Asian world.

The production features a strong international cast. Hany, (JACK IRISH) carries the series manfully, handsomely, on his broad shoulders.  Mind you, he is very much the current style of detective, with his obvious flaws, of which, perhaps, the writers have labored overly to give him an explanatory backstory. He apparently was born to the local ruling gentry, but lost his parents during the bloodbath of World War II, part of which he spent in the notorious Singaporean prison of war camp Changi.  Nevertheless, he had chosen to stay on as an ex-pat, who can speak the island city states major languages and has many connections throughout its society.  However, as Sam does generally choose to fight on the side of the angels,  Im not quite sure the drama can be described as noir.  But, no matter.  Joan Chen, (LUST, CAUTION; TWIN PEAKS, MARCO POLO), shows quite a range as the detective shop owner.  The pair are well-supported by Michael Dorman, (WONDERLAND), as Conrad Harrison, young CIA agent; Chin Han, (THE DARK KNIGHT, MARCO POLO), as Kay Song, chief of the powerful local Red Dragon gang and Maeve Dermody, (BLACKWATER), as Claire Simpson, beautiful wife of an important local businessman, Sams lover.  The scripts are shrewd, tight, action-filled.  The photography is excellent and atmospheric, product of an all-seeing eye; scenery outside the city, beautiful; inside, seems that it might have inspired the look of Ridley Scotts great 1982 BLADE RUNNER, in which the cityscape of Los Angeles has been thoroughly Asianized.

 Listen, the series cant be beat for its choice of time and place.  In 1964, the world is changing; the global balance of power is shifting. The colonial rule of the British has come to an end, independence is on the horizon. The island city state, birthed in blood, can now forge its own identity, in further bloody struggle. Singapore, which lies off the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, about 85 miles north of the equator, was first settled in the second century A.D., founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles (after whom I named a Malaysian-breed cat) as a trading post of the East India Company. The British claimed the island in 1824. It was occupied by the Japanese during World War II; became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963.

Serangoon Road.  Singapore radiates from it.  The one main artery that runs through the island; whether culture or crime, politics or patriotism, espionage or enterprise, all roads lead to Serangoon.  Too good to miss, I tell you.",1424563200,7,6091,5.10383064516129
6776505,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"This mid-1960s era action/adventure series comes complete with ample bombs, knives, kicks & fists. An Asian area, in the midst of the Vietnam escalation, causes the city to become infiltrated with international politics that interferes with its own local ways and economy. An interesting setting of varied conflict where Widow Patricia takes over her husband's Cheng Detective Agengy after his murder. Although the 5 lead characters are played by actors relatively uncommon to the American TV screen, they do a great job with this series. Sam, a child POW in WW2, mentally fights past issues as he assists Patricia with `one last case.' Then another, and Patricia's niece also helps and finds a romance interest in a CIA agent sent to Singapore. Sam has his own liaisons with a business man's wife. Plenty of sub-plots to go with the cases ranging from murder, adultery, missing person, and international smuggling. Most takes place in Chinatown, Singapore, a rough, dark, violent, and steamy community.

With so many good detective series, the completion is keen, but this Aussie, Asian, American, UK mix ranks in gripping watch-ability with the top 90%, thus earning it at least 4.5 stars, so round it to 5 and enjoy it at least once. It's back to 1964, and you'll recall some of the nostalgic music.

8685389,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"""Serangoon Road"" is a mystery series produced for HBO Asia in 2013 in collaboration with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It takes place in 1964 Singapore shortly after Malaysia obtained independence from Great Britain and before Singapore became independent from Malaysia. The Brits are pulling out of their crumbling empire, while the Americans are moving in with the intent of using Singapore as a base for covert operations in Asia. The Cold War is on: Americans, Brits, and their local allies on one side and communists, socialists, and labor unions on the other, while Singapore's ""secret societies"", which mainly profit from vice crimes, try to position themselves profitably in the new order. It is against this background that Sam Callaghan (Don Hany), an Australian expatriate who spent part of his childhood in Changi Prison under Japanese occupation before serving in the Australian army in Malaysia, runs an import-export business with his friend Kang (Alaric Tay). His neighbor is elegant widow Patricia Cheng (Joan Chen), who, cognizant of Sam's street connections and physical courage, hires him as an investigator for the Cheng Detective Agency.

I don't know how closely ""Serangoon Road"" physically resembles Singapore in the 1960s, but the series capitalizes on the inherent tensions and exoticism of a linguistically and ethnically heterogeneous society in the midst of sweeping political changes and under pressure from outside forces. It can't help but be interesting. There is no denying that the series is populated with stock characters: Sam is a scruffy, streetwise hero, perhaps more Chinese than Australian. Patricia Cheng is a beautiful, affluent widow. Her niece Cheng Su Ling is British-educated and resentful of her parents' expectations. Journalist Bruce ""Macca"" MacDonald is a stereotypical cynical post-War foreign correspondent. Kay Song (Chin Han) is a ruthless young gangster contemptuous of his grandfather's traditional management and eager to usurp him. Wild Bill (Ted Maynard) is the plainspoken American CIA station chief, while Conrad Harrison (Michael Dorman) is the idealist rookie agent. The list goes on. The cast is large. But the characters have plenty of texture. They are interesting. They make me want to know what they will do next, which is rare.

The only character that strikes me as false is the head of British MI6 operations in Singapore, Major Miller (Shane Briant). He is so duplicitous, amoral, and sleazy that he seems like a caricature. The episodes are peppered with action in the form of street-fighting. There is romance, tragedy, mystery, and politics too. The characters usually speak English but sometimes Mandarin. I am told that it is realistic that upper-class Chinese in Singapore would speak English to one another at this time in history. Mandarin, however, would not have been heard as much as a number of other Chinese dialects. Possibly the filmmakers chose Mandarin because they could easily find a cast who speaks it, and there is a bigger audience for Mandarin than for Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, etc. I have read criticisms that ""Serangoon Road"" features stereotypical characters and gets the geography of the road wrong. But stereotypical doesn't imply inaccurate. Having read the memoirs of some Western war journalists of the period, I can attest that ""Macca"" is perfectly plausible. There is probably a practical reason that the filmmakers concentrated on Chinese characters.

There are ten 55-minute episodes:

""Shotgun"": American sailor Daniel Maholovich (Jordan Prainito) is stabbed to death outside a Singaporean night club minutes before a bomb goes off. A group of Navy Seals observe his friend Nate Crosby (Cleave Williams) leaning over the body, so he is assumed to be Maholovich's murderer. American authorities hire the Cheng Detective Agency, owned by the widowed Patricia Cheng (Joan Chen) to find Crosby, as they believe she has good street contacts. Cheng asks her Australian neighbor Sam Callahan to do the job. He did work for her husband, and he seems to know everyone. Callahan is introduced to young CIA agent Conrad Harrison (Michael Dorman), who emphasizes the urgency of the situation, as Crosby is considered a security risk due to the sensitive nature of the work he did for the Navy. Meanwhile, Callahan's business partner Kang (Alaric Tay) in import/export is in hock to the Red Dragons due to gambling debts, and Sam is having an affair with Australian socialite Claire Simpson (Maeve Dermody), whose husband is frequently absent.

""Reach Out"": Sam's journalist acquaintance Bruce ""Macca"" MacDonald (Tony Martin) shows up at the Cheng Detective Agency with a Mrs. Feng (Xiang Yun), who has escaped communist China and returned to Singapore in search of the husband she left behind during the war. Patricia and Sam sympathize with her desire to find her husband Chan Li (Bernard Tan), so they agree to help. But Mrs. Feng can't seem to find the house she and her husband lived in until 1942. When she says she is sure that the present occupants are using her tea set and hair pins, a violent scuffle convinces Sam to try a different approach. Su Ling (Pamelyn Chee) sets about tracking down Chan Li through his old business interests. His fate is less than clear, as some people claim to have seen him shot by Japanese occupiers while newspapers indicate that he might have changed his name. Meanwhile, American Cultural Attach Conrad Harrison attempts to woo Su Ling, and the Red Dragons deny knowledge of a break-in at the Cheng Detective Agency.

""Ball of Confusion"": Amid street protests and riots in Singapore, Patricia Cheng attempts to deliver some photographs to a client before curfew, but she is assaulted and the photos stolen. When Patricia doesn't return, Su Ling asks Sam to find her. Doing so requires that he commandeer a car that will be allowed to pass after curfew. A photojournalist named Hafiz bin Ariffin (Osman Sulaiman) had taken Patricia to safety, but it seems that her assailant was specifically after the photos. The client was a Mrs. Lin, who hired the Cheng Detective Agency to photograph her husband, businessman James Lin (Edmund Chen), whom she suspected of having an affair. Sam tries to track down Mrs. Lin to get to the bottom of the photo incident. Hafiz is arrested on trumped-up charges, and Sam learns that the crackdown on street protests is being used to veil other activity. Meanwhile, Patricia contemplates how to get Sam to work officially for the Agency.

""Give Me Money"": Sam's business partner Kang (Alaric Tay) only gets deeper in debt with the Red Dragons when, unbeknownst to Kang, he pays Kay Song (Chin Han) with counterfeit money. The new manager of operations at Frank Simpson's company, Maxwell Black (Nicholas Bell), hires the Cheng Detective Agency to find out if one of his employees is taking kick-backs. He suspects Frank, placing Sam in the awkward position of having to investigate his mistress' husband. Sam pokes around at the company and learns that Frank's subordinate Peter Watson (Socratis Otto) also suspects him. Kay Song makes Sam an offer he can't refuse in order to enlist Sam's help in identifying the person who is betraying the Red Dragons to a rival gang and to the police. Conrad Harrison gets a chance to impress Su Ling with his gallantry and stature. The explosions and street fights in this episode are gang-related rather than political.

""Heatwave"": Sam and Kang ferry West Pacific's manager of operations, Maxwell Black, Frank and Claire Simpson, and journalist ""Macca"" MacDonald to a remote village where the company has made charitable contributions, including a jetty and medications for the local hospital. Claire meets a young boy who doesn't seem to be responding to treatment for malaria. She wonders if there could be something wrong with the medication. When Sam has a lab test a bottle of it, it turns out that the medication is diluted and therefore ineffective. Black hires the Cheng Detective Agency to investigate the diluted medication. Meanwhile, Claire takes it upon herself to take authentic drugs to the village, where Kang angrily criticizes her and Western Pacific for being ""short-term do-gooders"". Claire's moral rectitude endangers her husband's career and places her in the sights of MI6's Maj. Miller (Shane Briant), who seems to have his finger in every pie in Singapore.

""Tracks of My Tears"": It is the Month of the Hungry Ghost. A male infant is left on the doorstep of the Cheng Detective Agency with a note and a roll of money, but the ink on the note washes away in the rain, leaving no clue as to what the child's mother intended that the agency should do with the child. After some initial concern that the child could belong to Sam's ex-lover is dismissed, Kay Song's (Chin Han) sister Hue-Lin is discovered dead in the river, having suffered blood poisoning following a childbirth her family knew nothing about. It falls to Sam and Su Ling to discover the identity of the baby's father before Kay Song and his grandfather the Tiger General find the baby, its father, and the Amah who kept Hue-Lin's secret. Meanwhile, Conrad Harrison has returned from Saigon unimpressed by the situation there but still eager to battle communism. Su Ling is torn between her attraction to him and disapproval of his politics.

""My Girl"": Conrad Harrison interrupts a terrorist bombing while he and Su Ling are out for a stroll. He gives chase, but one of the bombers is shot by another party who knocks Harrison out. Police blame the bombing on unionists led by Professor Lin Chee Kit (Jason Cheong), brother of ambitious Singapore businessman James Lin (Edmund Chen). James Lin hires the Cheng  Detective Agency to find his brother before the police do, so that James can secret him out of the country. Su Ling doesn't believe that Prof. Lin could be guilty, as he always advocated nonviolence. Meanwhile, police arrest Kang for smuggling explosives for the unionists, which Kang claims were planted. He had intended to smuggle arak that is served at unionist clubs. Aiding terrorists carries the death penalty, so Sam is in a hurry to find the real culprit behind the bombing. Conrad comes across an MI6 file containing troublesome information about Su Ling while he's compiling a list of suspicious persons.

A representative of the Australian embassy (Tim Draxi) hires the Cheng Detective Agency to find two young Australian women who disappeared from the freighter Orion Star bound for England. Gina Kershaw (Sophie Hensser) and Camille Edquist (Siobhan Dow-Hall), whose father is a close friend of the Australian Prime Minister, were not on board when the ship docked in Singapore. Sam is suspicious when he finds their cabin door kicked in and their luggage gone. He learns that Hawk (Fish Chaar), as associate of the Red Dragons, may have removed two women from the ship when he made a ""milk run"" to deliver prostitutes to the crew. That's enough evidence for the Australian embassy to blame the Red Dragons, but Sam and Inspector Amran (Ario Bayu) are skeptical. Meanwhile, Mei Ling (Melody Chen), a waitress at Black Lotus Bar, reveals to Patricia Chen a secret about her deceased husband. Maj. Miller tells Conrad what he wants from him.

After a night on the town with barmaid and aspiring journalist Angelica Warnock (Ella Scott Lynch), sailor Robert Collier (Ernie Dingo) wakes in her apartment the next morning to find Angie has bled to death from a stab wound. He is immediately arrested and charged with her murder, but Robert doesn't remember what happened. He implores his old friend Sam to find out. Angie was a protg of journalist Bruce ""Macca"" MacDonald (Tony Martin) who tells Sam that she was researching a story on drug smuggling though Singapore's harbor. Sam speculates that may have led to her death, but Robert's case is complicated by racial politics in Australia, as he is Aboriginal. Meanwhile, Maj. Miller (Shane Briant) asks Conrad Harrison (Michael Dorman), who is becoming more resentful, to supply him with a CIA file on Vietnam. And Patricia Cheng implores Inspector Amran (Ario Bayu) to let her see the police file on her husband Winston's murder.

With Lee Kum Fong (Daryl D'Cotta) in jail for murder and also a suspect in Winston Cheng's (Russell Wong) murder, Sam and Patricia focus on finding Winston's killer. They retrace his last steps in an effort to identify the client Winston was meeting the night he died. The trail leads to a covert relationship between Singapore businessman James Lin, the CIA, the Red Dragons, and a mysterious business partner. Meanwhile, Wild Bill's (Ted Maynard) suspicions about Conrad Harrison have been aroused, and Conrad is becoming more assertive in demanding a quid pro quo from Maj. Miller. This episode wraps up several storylines that have carried through the season, such as Winston Cheng's murder and Sam and Claire's relationship, while leaving others hanging. Unfortunately, there was no second season, so some storylines remain unresolved.",1509235200,,13059,5.093414292386735

8685396,5,B00OYT0ZM6,"It's 1964 Singapore, a time when the curse ""May You Live in Interesting Times"" applies. The British Colonial rule is ending and the island city/state hasn't settled into its own identity yet. The identity crisis includes terrorist bombs, violent riots and racial tensions. Not just inner turmoil, but the Cold War has its icy fingers in the pie, too.

Against this multi-ethnic background, people are just trying to get along. Patricia Cheng is trying to keep her husband's Cheng Detective Agency afloat. At the least, she wants to solve one last mystery: Who murdered her husband, Winston? She hires Sam Callaghan to do the legwork.

Sam is an unsettled man. He's an expat Australian. As a child he saw his mother killed when the Japanese occupied Singapore. As an orphan, he was put in in an internment camp. He had worked for Winston off and on in the past so he knows the ropes. Or he thinks he does.

""Serangoon Road"" is categorized as a mystery because it has the one big mystery that takes all 10 episodes to solve. But each episode also has it's own mini-story line and the feelings can range from ""noire"" to political drama, from tough-guy thriller to Cold War shenanigans and on to romance. And speaking of romance, I loved the non-Hollywood ending.

I thought some of the acting was marvelous. Kok Tao Aunty, the street-wise fortune teller is a hoot. In addition, Joan Chen, as Patricia Cheng, has what I call a Helen Hayes smile  it can light up the room. Pamelyn Chee, playing Su-Ling, has the pert smarts of an Audrey Hepburn. And Michael Dorman is the quietly and firmly befuddled CIA agent.

Singapore has a real Serangoon Road, pronounced  sehr awn GOON. It is a broad boulevard and the area around it is known as Little India. Most of the island nation of Singapore is modern, so the producers had a challenge finding 1960's Singapore for filming. They ended up building a smaller cramped version of the road on a backlot on the neighboring small island of Batam, a 40 minute ferry ride across the Singapore Strait.

""Serangoon Road"" originally broadcast is Sept/Nov 2013. It is HBO Asia's first original commissioned series, and was produced in conjunction with Australia public TV. There are no plans to produce a series 2.  The show has 10 episodes which total 557 minutes of viewing, that's over 9 hours. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen with 5.1 surround sound. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and the 1st bonus feature.

Barron says, ""It was a fascinating time. And so the angst was to set a detective series against this backdrop, against this political, social upheaval that was going on, that was a world that's largely unknown to our audiences.""
....2.  Production Notes from Series Creator Paul Barron. This is 5 pages to read on screen. Barron writes, ""My intention was that 'Serangoon Road' would be a Singapore story, not just about some expats in an exotic location.""
....3.  Photo Gallery (1 minute)

This is a very enjoyable series, 4.5 stars rounded up to 5. Once in a while, the drama and dramatics gets a little ponderous, but overall it is quick on its feet with enough variety that we were never bored.
