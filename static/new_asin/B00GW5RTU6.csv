6120315,4,B00GW5RTU6,Great workout just like the first on. Love it.,1407888000,,46,4.222222222222222
6120316,5,B00GW5RTU6,"Excellent Seller!!  Great service!!
For me, Hip Hop Abs is a ""better"" workout than turbo Jam.  I am not sure about Level 1 because this is the Level 2 DVD's  and it is my first experience with HHA.  I think the Level 2 comes in the same package with Level 1  When you order from Beachbody a lot of stuff is included in the package... but on the internet you find people who are willing to sell you just One of the items at a time and that is okay by me.

Anyway, I would recommend this for people who have already been working out for a month or two.  It's not for complete beginners or for people who are in extremely Good physical condition.  so basically, you should need to work out but you are rusty and getting back into it.  Also best for people with a pooch in the abdomen.  This will not give you a six pack it is designed to aerobically work out the abs. People who already have ""flat"" abs may find it easy but that is because the abs are not a problem area or a fat deposit area for them.  If you have a belly you will feel the burn.  I sweat more doing this.  It is a challenge I look forward to.  My legs are already strong so the Turbo jam with all the kicking is not as challenging.",1406073600,9,1197,3.9957805907172994
6120317,5,B00GW5RTU6,"This is the second ""Hip Hop Abs"" set released by Beachbody instructor Shaun T; it is known as both Hip Hop Abs Level 2 and Hip Hop Abs Ultimate.  (I believe that the ""Ultimate"" version may have been sold with extras, including the weighted gloves worn by Shaun T for several of the workouts and a workout rotation calendar.)  Although I never tried the original Hip Hop Abs, I decided to jump right in with Level 2 since I exercise daily and consider myself to be at least an intermediate level.  Plus, I was also already familiar with Shaun T's style from another one of his workout series, Rockin' Body.

For these workouts, Shaun T instructs live in front of a group of six background exercisers (both men and women).  The woman to his left, Tania, always shows modifications, mainly keeping the moves low-impact.  Minimal equipment is needed for these routines:  Shaun T uses optional weighted gloves during two of the workouts, but the rest of the group uses light dumbbells instead.  Also, two of the workouts have short floorwork sequences, so a mat is helpful.

This is a 2-DVD set.  I have broken down each in further detail below.

The Main Menu for DVD 1 lists FAT BURNING CARDIO 2, AB SCULPT 2, and SPECIAL FEATURES (Meet the Cast 1, Meet the Cast 2, Slim in 6, Beachbody Supplements, Turbo Jam).  The two workouts are described below.

FAT BURNING CARDIO 2 (44.5 minutes)
This is an all-standing routine, and it is the only one in which the weighted gloves are not used.  Shaun T begins with a 3.5-minute warm-up that mainly alternates marches, slides, and ab pumps; he ends the warm-up with a brief static stretch.  The moves in this routine incorporate Shaun's ""tilt, tuck, tighten"" principle, with many of the moves starting from a basic bounce (sort of a mini standing crunch) and building from there.  Furthermore, quite a few of the exercises here also appear in the other workouts, including Ghetto Stomp, Double Dutch, Kick-It, and Booty Pop.  Shaun concludes with a short (1.5-minute) cool-down that includes standing side stretches.

AB SCULPT 2 (32 minutes)
For this routine, Shaun T wears his optional weighted gloves.  There is more focus on abs toning here, yet this is still a cardio workout.  Again, the 3.5-minute warm-up includes marches, slides, and ab pumps.  Shaun has his background exercisers pick up their weights for abs-focused moves such as row the boat, core twist, and washing machine.  With 10 minutes left, Shaun moves to the floor for 3 minutes of plank work (Tania modifies on all 4s) and then 3 minutes of c-curve abdominals.  The 3.5-minute final stretch includes both lying and prone work before coming to standing to finish.

The Main Menu for DVD 2 offers the third workout, TOTAL BODY BURN 2, plus a bonus segment, GET ABS OR DIE TRYING.  The latter is a choreographed dance sequence that Shaun and crew break down for those who wish to learn.

TOTAL BODY BURN 2 (45 minutes)
This workout alternates between more cardio-focused segments and more toning-type sequences.  Shaun T wears his weighted gloves for the entire routine, but the background exercisers pick up weights for the toning portions only.  The 4-minute warm-up is similar to the others in this set, with marches, tucks, and slides; Shaun again adds a short static stretch to the end.  Each sequence lasts about 3-4 minutes.  Again, many of the moves have appeared in the other routines, including washing machine, twist with knee, and pass-the-dutch.  With 10 minutes left, Shaun T suggests getting a mat, but he continues for an additional 5-minutes of standing work, moving into a step out lunge lunge sequence which become progressively more difficult.  The 5-minute floor work includes brief push-ups and some c-curve abs work before concluding with a final stretch.

Overall, I am really enjoying these workouts.  I'm generally not a big cardio person, so I like that these routines are fun and dancey without being complicated or overly repetitive.  I also really like the focus on the abs--in fact, I have found that keeping the cardio lower impact (mostly following Tania) helps me keep the work in my abs even more.  Although Shaun T is incredibly goofy (he is constantly making up silly rhymes) and self-centered (one of the songs is actually sung by him and ABOUT him, with the words ""Shaun T...that's me""), you can't help but to like him!  Plus, he's actually a great instructor:  he provides mirrored cuing, he always counts reps evenly, and he is constantly offering helpful form pointers.  Finally, he makes it all appear easy, coming off as completely laid-back yet having boundless energy.

The only thing I did NOT like about these workouts was how LOUD the music is.  When you choose your workout, there is an option for ""Music even louder?""  I always selected ""NO"" for this, but even so, the music is loud enough to make Shaun T hard to hear at times.

In the end, however, if you want to have fun while exercising, I would definitely recommend this DVD set.",1405555200,21,4995,4.8065650644783116

6120331,5,B00GW5RTU6,Great exercise program. I recommend getting level one first then progressing to this as it is important to get the exercise moves right. Really good work out. Interesting and keeps you motivated  and it works!! Some of the crew at the back are really amusing. Recommended highly. I can't  stop doing these exercises.,1438819200,2,316,4.943396226415095
6120332,5,B00GW5RTU6,"These videos incorporate a bit more jumping jack-type exercises compared to Level 1, but they are still very fun videos that are all a great workout!  Shaun T is excellent.  All of his videos are great.  He really teaches you how to focus your workouts, so you can get the most out of the time you spend.",1437696000,,304,4.298245614035087
6120333,4,B00GW5RTU6,"Level 2 is about the same as level 1, but with a slightly longer exercise time for each one. The moves retain a lot of their repetitive sameness, and shouldn't be to difficult to pick up after a few times going through the videos. If you've done any of Shaun T's other workouts, such as 'Insanity,' this will probably be far too easy for you. However, due to the sheer amount of focus you have to put on your abs during these exercises, and the amount of time spent on them, you will definitely be seeing at least a slight difference in them after a few weeks of consistent practice. If you'd like my advice, as someone who does both 'Insanity' & 'Hip Hop Abs' on a weekly basis, alternate between the two- do one hard workout one day, and switch to the easier version the next, taking a few days' rest in between one or two out of the week. I guarantee that this, coupled with a moderate diet, will give you results.",1436400000,4,917,4.275862068965517

8627914,5,B00GW5RTU6,I found the level 1 Hip Hop Abs at a thrift store and really liked it so I thought I'd try Level 2.  Shaun T is so much fun and it's a great cardio and strengthening workout!  He really shows you the moves and explains what to do before speeding things up.  I think it is a step up in difficulty from Level 1.  It's a great way to unwind and lose the stress of the day.,1485648000,,369,3.7532467532467533
