8683996,5,B000AN38YW,"This is the best bloopers video I have ever seen. It's like they sat around and said, ""Hey, let's make a football bloopers video without any actual football bloopers. Instead, we'll show some normal football minor errors, then have a bizarre conversation between 'Tom' and 'Coach.' Put in a backdrop of crazy music, cut away from actual football for a series of non-sequiturs, and we're done!"" The result is pure gold. This isn't a film that shows football bloopers, the film itself is the blooper. The VHS playback adds to the comedy by further warping the music and voice overs.

My friend bought this from a Ross in the early nineties. In college, we watched this jewel while drinking countless times, and still quote it to this day. Unfortunately, you can't find any clips on Youtube so you can preview the awesomeness in store for you if you buy this masterpiece. I own Football Bloopers, and am seriously considering replacing my dead VCR so I can watch it again.

Highlights:
The movie appears to begin in the middle of a larger production. The opening line is ""And it may help the quarterback to get a good, firm grip on the snap."" It also has a strange conclusion.
At certain parts of the show, it's impossible to discern what the commentators are saying. You can debate this with your friends.
Amazing low-budget 1989 special effects! This includes drawing cartoon mustaches on people!
OJ Simpson is in it! He gets tackled and it looks like they rip his pants. What a blooper!
After the slow-motion ballet part, the Coach and Tom disappear and someone else becomes the commentator. The footage, sound quality, and expressions used seems like it was all filmed in the 70's.

All in all,  I highly recommend. If anyone is capable of posting clips to Youtube, I would be so happy.",1422489600,,1787,4.717948717948718
