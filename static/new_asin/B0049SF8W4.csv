4293990,5,B0049SF8W4,I was skeptical at first but have to this turned out to be a very good movie. What's even more awesome about it is actually having Ip Man's son in there as the humble practioner refining a future master. Two thumbs uo.,1288051200,2,218,4.214285714285714
4293991,4,B0049SF8W4,"Wing Chun is one of the major schools of Chinese martial arts.  It uses short, in-close movements as its major means of attack/defense.  This DVD has some excellent examples of the style, and gives some idea of what this form looks like.
This  DVD, in conjunction with the other two Ip Man DVD's give a good historical look at the form and its development.",1285718400,2,356,4.53125

Funny that the actor portraying Ip at his college age meets and learns from Leung Bik and is played by Ip's real son who was in his mid-80's by then.  The storyline is amazing and the action all the way through is excellent.  With Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao in it, it is over the top with great martial action.",1460073600,,483,4.095744680851064

4294092,5,B0049SF8W4,"Tracing the legend of Bruce Lee's master, Ip Man, back to the beginnings in Foshan, China, Ip Man: Legend is Born tells the true life story of this grandmaster of Wing Chun, played by 2010 World Wushu Champion, Dennis To, and features some of the best martial arts choreography ever captured on screen as well as ranking as one of my top ten martial arts movie of all time and also incorporating what can easily be deemed one of the best five story lines in a martial arts film. This movie has it all -- martial arts  training as a disciple, the challenge from different schools (in this case a misnomer, as the challenge actually comes from the Japanese), the defence of Chinese pride against disrespectful foreigners, love, betrayal, intrigue, and an historically accurate spy story thrown in.

The story revolves around the lives of two boys, one the son of a rich man and the other an adopted son whom their father had found abandoned in the blind downpour of rain; and as the movie proceeds, they are introduced to the grand master of Wing Chun, Chan Wah Shun, portrayed by Samo Hung in a cameo appearance, who passes away within an extremely short span of time. Then, the story turns to Ip Man leaving Foshan for Hong Kong to pursue tertiary education and sees him defending the Chinese against foreign aggressors, by the way of a British teen who calls the Chinese pigs during a football match, and having challenged the foreigner, who further insults the Chinese by calling them the sick old man of Asia, they engage in a duel that sees Ip Man breaking the foreigners hand, and having taught the British a lesson through that feat, sets the bone straight again. Following this encounter Ip Man's reputation in Hong Kong grows and, searching for medication for his new found friend, the foreigner, Ip enters a Chinese medicine shop where he is challenged and badly humiliated by Leung Bik, played by Ip Chun - the real life son of Ip Man, who had broken away from the traditional school of Wing Chun as founded by his family, thereby, cementing a conflict with his brothers Ng' Chung So and Chen Wa Shun, who are considered the orthodox school of Wing Chun; and, having been so humiliated, accepts Leung Bik as his master and begins training as Leung Bik's disciple. When he returns to Foshan, he demonstrates and proves the superiority of Leung Bik's style over traditional Wing Chun and is punished by his master, played by Yuen Biao, who had taken over the reins from Chan Wah Shun.

Meanwhile, the Japanese have challenged Yuen Biao's school, and having been defeated by the Ip Man's adopted brother, who we will later be made to realize was a Japanese agent who had been sent to Foshan as a child to infiltrate Chinese society so that the Japanese could further their imperial ambitions in China, seeks to convince Yuen Biao's school to accept the Japanese as disciples.

The movie culminates with Ip's adopted brother finally being made ,by the Japanese, to slaughter everyone at Yuen Biao's school of martial arts, and the climactic battle between the two which is one of the most exhilarating fight sequences you will ever see on film.

Highly recommended.",1386806400,2,3171,4.716606498194946

For the record I rate the first one, #2 and the 2nd one #3. I recommend this movie for anyone who watched the first two and was left wanting more and I recommend it for anyone who hasn't watched any of the Ip Man movies, because of the backstory it's easy to follow along.",1378684800,,465,4.054347826086956

But this is actually a fanciful prequel, starring charismatic martial arts expert To Yu-hang, also known as Dennis To, as Ip Man (1893-1972), the famous martial artist and teacher of Wing Chun kung fu. As a boy, Ip Man is advised to always focus on what you feel, not what you see. He is obviously gifted and is sent for his studies to Hong Kong. There he receives lessons in Wing Chun techniques from eccentric elderly coach Leung Bik, played by Ip Chun, real-life son of Ip Man. The young man resolves to start his own school of mixed martial arts techniques after graduation. But upon his return, his master (Yuen Biao) is outraged by his student's improvisatory kung fu, which seems to him undisciplined. These issues and personal problems must be put aside, however, due to an invasion by Japanese spies and ninjas: issues of family sacrifice and betrayal so central to HK cinema come to the fore. The climactic sequence with action choreography by Bruce Leung must be seen to be believed. Director Herman Yau masterfully oversees both the narrative arc and the eye-popping combat sequences, which will be thoroughly enjoyed by all fans of martial arts techniques. This combination Blu-Ray and DVD has supplements featuring brief interviews with cast members. In Chinese with English subtitles.",1377907200,4,1422,4.953974895397489

4294114,3,B0049SF8W4,"Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.

I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this ""biographical"" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.

The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.

In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans. It has an interesting, if wildly fictional, story and is well-acted. It's a great movie for a lazy afternoon.",1365379200,,1240,4.576576576576577

4294135,3,B0049SF8W4,"This is a PREQUEL to the Wilson Yip directed 2-part biography of the Wing Chun wizard Ip Man, which starred Donnie Yen, and was choreographed by Sammo Hung (""The Victim"") and Tony Leung Siu-Hung (""Bloodmoon"").  This film replaces Yen with Dennis To (""Bodyguards and Assassins"") and the director's chair is now filled by Herman Yau (the ""Troublesome Night"" series).  After sitting out ""Ip Man 2"", Tony Leung Siu-Hung  is back, teaming with Checkley Sin Kwok-Lam to stage the fights.  Several of the cast members from the first two films have different roles in this, including Sammo and Fan Siu Wong (""Story of Ricky"").

Ip Man is a young teen in the very early 1900s when his father sends him and his adopted brother Tin Chi (Fan Siu Wong) to study Wing Chun with Chan Wah Shun (Hung) in the city of Foshan.  When the Master falls terminally ill, he asks Ng Chung So (Yuen Biao, ""Dragons Forever"") to oversee the school.  Man and Tin Chi grow into respectful and dedicated students and Ip Man briefly leaves Foshan for scholastic studies in Hong Kong, where he learns a few amended moves from his deceased master's disgraced former-student Leung Bik (Ip Chan, son of the actual Ip Man).  When he returns to Foshan he'll have to deal with jealousy, love, tenacity and the Japanese.

This is not a bad movie at all but much of it registers a little flat.  Dennis To does an okay job as actor but had little experience prior to this film.  I certainly look forward to seeing him in more stuff.  Otherwise silly situations and dialogue marr the film's overall presentation but if you were watching for the fights then you shouldn't be too disappointed.  Plenty of fast exchanges with minimal wirework that's only used to SLIGHTLY exaggerate a move or recovery and for that I say ""thank you!""  I must mention that I normally find it excruciating when movies like this show an older gentleman trying to best a young fella but here it actually works.  Ip Chan was at least 85 when this film was made. While you wouldn't expect him to single-handedly clean out a bar filled with sailors, his athleticism is nonetheless impressive.  It was also nice to see Yuen Biao again as his movie appearances seem to occur with decreasing frequency.

The history of Wing Chun seems to be a fascinating subject to Sammo Hung as I've seen 5 movies that attempt to depict the art and he has been involved with all of them.  It's assumed that his interest blossomed via his friendship with Bruce Lee, as Mr. Lee was a student of Ip Man. Prior to his work on the ""Ip Man"" franchise, Hung directed and starred in the non-sequential ""Warriors Two"" (1978) and ""The Prodigal Son"" (1981).  ""Warriors Two"" featured Cassanova Wong as the Cashier (or Banker) Wah, the same character depicted by Sammo in this film.  ""The Prodigal Son"" featured Yuen Biao as Leung Chang (played in ""Warriors Two by Leung Kar Yan), the man who would go on to teach Cashier Wah.  The art before that is a bit of a mystery but it originated from a Shaolin nun who blended the Snake & Crane styles specifically for female student Yim Wing Chun, who went on to marry (and teach) a man whose surname was Leung.

The National Arts/Mei Ah/Eleven Arts/Funimation DVD has a very fine widescreen picture with spoken languages available in English or Cantonese.  Subtitles only available in English.  Special features consist of a ""making of"" segment and some trailers.  This is not a bad film and has better-than-average fights but I'm not sure how heartily I can recommend it.  I think it's arguably better than part 2 but inferior to part 1.  As much as I historically love Chinese film, this almost gets an extra star just for NOT being wire-fu epic!  3.5 out of 5.

The movie simply tends to drag a little bit. While I understand that this is a depiction of the life of an actual person, the story between Ip Man, his adopted brother, and Ip's wife was simply not that interesting. This is the drag on the movie.

I loved Ip's real life son in the movie, plus it was nice to see Fan Siu Wong actually get a chance to show his skill in this movie, rather play a background actor.

I have seen Daniel (Yu-Hang) To in the other Ip Man movies (Ip Man, Ip Man 2, both are excellent movies) and he did a solid job in those movies with smaller roles. I was a bit surprised to see him as the main featured actor in a role as Ip Man but he does a very good job, both with humility and pride. I appreciate the fact this movie focuses on the development / advancement of Wing Chun, portrayed by Ip Chung, an ""authentic"" Wing Chun practitioner and son of the actual Ip Man. Ip Chung plays the role of Leung Bik and portrays him well for the brief amount of time he appears on screen.

Like the previous Donnie Yen featured Ip Man movies, The Legend Is Born centers on the Japanese invasion of China, and the response of the Chinese people. There are civil wars as well as struggles to unify China versus Japan. The martial arts action is quite good, intentionally amusing at various times, and not over the top with their usage of wires for some of the stunts.

4294140,3,B0049SF8W4,"An ""Ip Man"" film without Donnie Yen? You may be thinking such a project will end up with terrible results. In fact, flawed as it is, ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born"" is not that bad, thanks to the capable cast including Dennis To and Fan Siu-wong, as well as supports from familiar faces from Hong Kong cinema such as Yuen Biao, Lam Suet and Sammo Hung in a cameo role.

In ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born,"" Dennis To (also known as Yu-Hang To) plays the legendary martial arts fighter and master of Bruce Lee. The film chronicles his young days in early 20th century Foshan, where he meets his future wife Cheung Wing-shing (Huang Yi), and Hong Kong, where he learns a new fighting style from another Wing Chun master (played by Ip Chun, Ip Man's real-life son).

Dennis To (with physical resemblance to Donnie Yen) is credible as young Ip Man. Action sequences are competent, but not as innovative as those of other two ""Ip Man"" movies starring Donnie Yen, who always adds something new to the choreography. One exception is a brief but impressive sparring scene by Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (both blindfolded), but the rest of the martial arts stunts lacks style or power Donnie Yen might have brought in.

The story is weak and sometimes incomprehensible, and the production design looks not very authentic. I don't mind these things anyway because what I want is action. ""Ip Man: The Legend is Born"" tries its best, but after our watching the two Donnie Yen features, the new film's action is just adequate.",1335398400,,1503,4.600746268656716

4294161,3,B0049SF8W4,"There is no denying that the legend of martial arts teacher Yip Man (also known as the man who taught Wing Chun to Bruce Lee) have been a financial success in Asia.

With the popularity of the first two ""Ip Man"" films starring Donnie Yen, there have been big questions on how to continue the Ip Man stories, especially with Donnie Yen not wanting to do anymore Ip Man films.  The solution, focus on a prequel while Ip Man was young or focus in the future when he is much older.

And in 2010, Director Herman Yau (""All's Well Ends Well 2010', ""The Eight Immortals Restaurant: The Untold Story"") and screenwriter Erica Lee (""King of Comedy"", ""Only Fools Fall in Love"") decided to do the former with their film ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"".

While not an officially related to the first two films, Yau did cast Dennis To who looks like a younger Donnie Yen, while also casting Sammo Hung and Fan Siu-wong who both appeared in the previous Donnie Yen ""Ip Man"" films.  But perhaps the biggest draw was the casting of Ip Chun, the actual son of Ip Man, who plays the role as Leung Bik (the man who would teach Ip Man a new style of Wing Chun).

While the film does take liberties by creating fictional stories around the true story of Ip Man's actual martial arts training when he was younger, the addition of half-brother and also Japanese antagonists continues the trend of foreign invaders vs. Ip Man.

VIDEO:

""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and the film is intentionally saturated and warm in the beginning but later becomes fully detailed and colors are vibrant.  There is very good clarity and detail on clothing and wooden objects, doors and fences.  You can see the detail on the album that Wing-shing is carrying as each line around the album is visible.  While closeups do not show skin pores or that much detail, primarily detail is scene on clothing and objects.  I didn't notice any banding issues or artifacts.  Overall, skintones are natural, black levels are very good and picture quality is great!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is presented in Cantonese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is presented with English subtitles. As all Asian films that I watch, I prefer not to watch the English dub track but for those who prefer it, there is an English dub track included and the fact that FUNimation is well-known for their voice actors that they hire, I would think that fans of these English voice actors should have no problem with them.

I will say that the lossless audio track was not as immersive as I would have liked.  But while there are plenty of action sequences in this film, it's not like the previous ""Ip Man"" films which tend to sound more immersive.  The action sequences do sound good and are effective during the action sequences but these moments are not as long as I would have hoped.

But overall, the the lossless audio track features crystal clear dialogue, music and action sequences when it is featured onscreen.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Legend is Born: Ip Many"" comes with the following special features:

  Making of - (13:21) Behind the scenes footage and interviews with the cast.
  Theatrical Trailer - (1:58) The original theatrical trailers for ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"".

EXTRAS:
""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" comes with a DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I loved Donnie Yen's first ""Ip Man"" film, the second was OK and despite this film not being related to the other two and is more about Ip Man's earlier life, I would have to say that this film is primarily a popcorn action film.

There are lot of liberties taken with Ip Man's life and unless you do the research, some people may think he actually had a half-brother and that what they are seeing onscreen is biographical.  But the truth is that there are fictional moments that are presented around Ip Man's non-fictional life as a young man learning Wing Chun, that I often wonder how he would feel if he was alive today and see how writers really distorted his life for the sake of entertainment.

Granted, the film does feature Ip Man's son, Ip Chun which was great!  And I can only hope that the estate of Ip Man are getting paid well with all these ""Ip Man"" related stories and I don't think that there will be an end to these stories anytime soon.  They make money and people all over the world love the martial arts action that comes along with these films.

But while I did enjoy ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"", as a guy who loves to research the lives of these individuals that these movies are based on.  I now wonder how much of what is featured in this film is actually truth.  We know that Ip Man studied under Chan Wah-shun and when he died, Ng. Chung-sok took over.  It is documented that he studied in Hong Kong and learned alternate forms of Wing Chun from Leung Bik.

But other than that, we know that he had a brother but not this half-brother that was featured in the film.  Was there a real Mei Wai?  Did Ip Man meet his wife at a market?  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure what is fiction and what is non-fiction in this film aside from the training from his two masters.

And personally, I just hope there is not a constant number of films that are released and continue to distort the true story of his life.  If anything, I hope that people are smart enough to know that ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is completely accurate.

Outside of that, I will say that the casting of Dennis To is fantastic.  I know the director has made it clear that this film is not a prequel to the previous two films but I have to admit, Dennis To looks like a younger version of Donnie Yen.  And for anyone watching this film, they will think that this film is an actual prequel to the other two films because of that.  Also, casting Sammo Hung and Fan Siu-wong who starred in the Donnie Yen ""Ip Man"" films also makes things a bit interesting.

As for the Blu-ray release, you get the making of and trailers.  Picture quality is very good and the lossless soundtrack is also very good but not too immersive.

Overall, ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" is an entertaining popcorn action, martial arts film but it's also another film that distorts the life of the actual man.  Throwing in a fight against Japanese dressed as ninjas is becoming a bit too farfetched and more Shaw Brothers-like than any other ""Ip Man"" film before it. But I do understand that as long as these ""Ip Man"" films continue to be made, it does well in the box office.

""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" continues the action but showcases Ip Man during the time of his earlier teenage years.  If you are looking for a martial arts film to sit back and enjoy without wanting to learn about the actual history of the man who taught Bruce Lee, then definitely give this film a try!",1323993600,47,6818,4.451248992747784

You are kidding yourself if you believe that Sammo Hung Kam-bo is going to appear in anything less than a Grade A movie. Just like any great American actor, why would he? Ip Chun, the real-life eldest son of Ip Man appears in the movie as one of historical sifus his father trained under. The story line is set before the Ip Man story line and deals with a young Ip Man (Yu Hang-To, who looks just like a young Donnie Yen) learning Wing Chun from three different sifu. The special effects and martial arts scenes are entriguing, but remember this is a historical piece about a real master of a real art, not fantasy martial arts. So if you are looking for people soaring through trees and fighting on water, best to rent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The sets are beautiful and if you are a lover of all things Chinese you will be entralled with the very essence of this movie. I saw it in Cantonese with no sub-titles and then with English subs. Even without the subs the gist of the story was easy to follow. Ip Man is critical to the martial arts explosion of the seventies as his lessons shaped Bruce Lee's vision of martial arts, his own system, Jeet Kune Do, and ultimately his ability to capture the world's attention. Wing Chun caused Bruce to set aside the ""classical mess"" with all the fancy stances and dance-like formalities and adopt a more economical, decisive fighting method. This is why at the end of Ip Man 2 there is a clear nod to Bruce Lee. May you all be well, and enjoy life.",1302912000,5,1581,4.380952380952381

4294175,2,B0049SF8W4,"I order this DVD from ying138, and the quality is good, there are Chinese audio  and English subtitle.

However, from the martial arts point of view, I am very disappointed with the martial arts choreographer/director, the actors' performances and the filming techniques. The Wing Chun performance in this movie is very ineffective, weak, there is no energy, and unrealistic. There is no real body structure, power and spirit in the performance. It is terrible, comparing to some other older movies such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prodigal-Son/dp/B000J9YJT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prodigal Son</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Victim/dp/B00005ALMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Victim</a>"". The film techniques made the fights looked like a soap opera performance.

The story also contained a lot of completely bad historical tales. For instance, during his time, sifu Ip Man had never wanted to teach Wing Chun to foreigners. And it was one of the reasons why he disliked Bruce Lee. But in the movie, it showed that sifu Ip Man wanted to sell Wing Chun around the world.

And the things about authentic Wing Chun, the conflict between Ng' Chung So, Chen Wa Shun and Leung Bik were completely bogus. Besides, according to sifu Ip Ching and Ip Chun (two sons of sifu Ip Man), the very existence of the Leung Bik character was very questionable, as well as the time sifu Ip Man supposed to study Wing Chun in Hong Kong.

In the real life, father of sifu Ip Man was very wealthy, and sifu Ip Man never lived in the Wing Chun school.
The name of the Wing Chun school was not Jing Wu (as in the movie). In the real life, Jing Wu was the name of Huo Yuanjia's school in Shang Hai, as featured in some other movies such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jet-Li-s-Fearless/dp/B000K2UW06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jet Li's Fearless</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-Legend/dp/B00003W8NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of Legend</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-Of-Fury/dp/B0015RCUR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist Of Fury</a>""

For people who know Wing Chun only through Ip Man's system (which seem to be the whole western world), sifu Ip Man was only one of millions Wing Chun practitioners. He happened to have a student which was the loud-mouth Bruce Lee, therefore he became famous. Although sifu Ip Man had great skills in Wing Chun, there were (and there are) many many others much better than him in Asia. And what the western world sees about Wing Chun is just a weak commercialized version of the true combat art.",1295568000,61,2766,5.937185929648241
4294176,3,B0049SF8W4,"Starts as a rather sweet romantic pantomime, but towards the end devolves into something completely silly: for some inexplicable reason the writers decided that Ip Man's adoptive brother was a Japanese ninja spy planted in Fatshan at the age of the 12.  Why oh why oh why?  Reminiscent of Ip Man 1, where Ip Man suddenly became a patriotic hero, single-handedly enthusing the masses to rise up against the Japanese oppressor - possibly good for ratings on the mainland, but not a whole lot to do with historical reality.

If you're a student of Wing Chun, a lot of attention has been paid to detail, and there are some fun fight scenes, though a lot of blows seem to be delivered with no noticeable effect.  The filmmakers seemed to be pursuing some agenda with respect to the 'authenticity' of Wing Chun variants, but I came away confused as to what they were trying to say.  There also seemed to be a sub-agenda dealing with Wing Chun's capacity to deal with modern grappling styles, a subject of much recent and heated debate, and this seemed to me forced and heavy-handed - though perhaps the casual viewer wouldn't have noticed the sub-agenda.  However the cameo by Ip Chun is delightful.

If you're a student of Cantonese, the Cantonese audio track is exceedingly clear and easy to understand.

If you are a completest or a kung fun nut, go ahead and spend the money.  If you actually want something concrete for your hard earned money and precious time, watch Ip Man 1 or 2 again.",1288137600,111,721,4.368421052631579
