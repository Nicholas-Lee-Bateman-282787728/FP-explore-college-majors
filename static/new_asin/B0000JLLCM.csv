The film has an amazing twist, a very convincing lead actor and supporting cast, and provides a thought-provoking lesson about friendship.  I hear the producer put this together with a budget of only $3,500!  I can only imagine if he was given a REAL budget.  If you can get past the stereotypes and challenges of movies with limited capacity and focus on its content vs. what the director had to work with, you are in for an impressive film.  It's definitely worth the purchase.  Why didn't Hollywood pick this film up?",1233705600,,643,4.6875
