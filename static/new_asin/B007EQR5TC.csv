8515455,1,B007EQR5TC,"I collect musical videos, this was the first time I ever returned a video. Very little music, all TV interviews..not what I expected.
Nice cover, the rest was all talk......not music.",1409270400,,183,4.935483870967742

8515457,5,B007EQR5TC,"Hi my name is Janel people know me as Jay and most call me Jaynil. My shosen and number one review is Whitney. Whitney Houston for who she was. We all knew how amazing and talented she was as an actor but most known as a singer. Her music inspired me and guied me trhu my lifestyle. Bad moments and not so bad one. She was a tru excemple of what it was to look for God not just in bad times but great ones. I miss her and wish she was still in present with us. But only God guides us to our destiny yet we need to know how we shoes to do in life. God has the answer of why she was taken away from her love one and her fans. R.I.P Whitney Elizabeth Houston. Your music is, has, and will always be in my heart. I'll Always Love You.

8515458,5,B007EQR5TC,"Seeing as this is a copy of different interviews given by Whitney over the years, I will say this DVD is very well done. It has 146 mins. of nothing other than Whitney.  Her interviews and private moments are broken down into *17 Chapters* on the Main Menu. The menu is very easy to navigate.

The *Chapters* range from pre-Bodyguard days to an interview given some time during her last world tour in 2010.  The 2009 interview with Oprah is also included.

Some interviews will make you laugh because Whitney's sense of humor, her laughter and quick whit jump out at the viewer.  Her interviews with Rosie O'Donnell had me LOL.

Whitney's moments with her Mom are endearing.  The 2010 interview, after her Moscow concert, was bit of a tear jerker.

The photo-shoot for her Greatest Hits album, with Clive Davis, is also included.

I am happy I decided to purchase this DVD and believe other Whitney fans will be pleased with it also.

Please keep in mind, a few of these interviews are *very dated*, and have been transfered to this DVD.  Their picture quality is not 100%, though the content is 100% Whitney during her time with us.  Also, Whitney DOES NOT perform
during these interviews.

On a scale from 1 to 10 and given the material the studio had to work with, I give this DVD a strong 9.  Other DVD's about Whitney have been rushed jobs.  This DVD, I believe, was given a good measure of thought before it's release.",1337904000,18,1424,4.551181102362205
