1675051,3,B00005Y71O,"If you're looking for the big kill, this video isn't for you. The producers showed real imagination with the bone collection and making the ""Super Croc"", come to life in a model but I was looking for the kill.  Even though they showed a couple of the scenes, zebras crossing the river and gazelles drinking, it was more of a ""what was/if"" kind of documentary.",1205712000,,359,4.523076923076923

1675053,3,B00005Y71O,"For me, the appeal of a video on humungous crocodiles would be to actually see them in their glory, in their environment, in action.  The producers of this video chose not to travel back in time a few hundred million years with their cameras.  Perhaps that trip would have strained their budget.  Well excuuuuuse me.

Since they took the lazy way out, and simply followed some present day archaeologists and croc-workers, the least they could have done was to offer us a mega-million dollar computer recreation of these supercrocs in action in their native environment.  But nooooooo.

What we're left with is just those archaelogists and crocologists, and a clay sculpture of a supercroc that doesn't even eat people.  Where's the fun in that?  They could have at least had the clay croc with moveable jaws and have it eat a few of the extras.

So we see some regular guys in the Sahara chipping away at bones in the sand and wimpily complaining about a little heat.  So it's 120 degrees out.  Big deal.  I can't feel it.  Bunch of gurly men.

Then they ride crocodiles.  So they can measure their heads and bodies.  So they can determine the mathematical ratio between a croc's head and its body.  So they can estimate the body length of the supercroc whose skull they have found.  But mostly, so they can have the fun of riding crocodiles, and have something interesting to put on the video.  Yee hah!  Giddyup croc.

Here are some of the interesting facts I learned from this video.  If you call a croc by its name it will come to you and beg for food like a cat.  Not that any cat or dog I ever had ever knew its name and responded to it.  I didn't own my pets.  They owned me.  Who was doing all the work?  Who was supplying the food?  Who was lazing around the house all day?  Think about it.  Just who is working for who?

At one point, a guy stuck his arm into the mouth of a sedated croc, all the way in, and right to its stomach, and we get to see the inside of the croc.  It had a lot of worms in it.  Makes me wonder about you.  Do you have worms inside you as well?  I think you do.

Why did he do that?  To recover a little machine he planted inside that very croc previously.  And what did he learn from that informative experiment?  I donno.  He didn't say.  What I learned from it is that I probably have worms in me.  Not as big as the worms in you though.

I think I know why they didn't go back in time hundreds of millions of years to show Supercroc eating dinosaurs by the seashore.  It is because it is all just a question of scale.  What's the difference between a supercroc eating a dinosaur and a regular modern croc eating your high school math teacher?  Not a lot.  It's just a question of scale.  Big guy eating big guy, little guy eating little guy, it will look pretty much the same on camera.",1139961600,3,2825,4.261363636363637
1675054,5,B00005Y71O,This is a very educative movie about the prehistoric croc that was probably about 35-40 feet in length and weighed about ten tons. Starting from the Discovery of the Skelton of this supercroc's skull to various observations and calculations taken from watching the dimensions and different behavious of the Crocs around the globe and finally leading to the estimated model of the Supercroc based on these averages. The movie is quite advenurous and looks rational. Another National geographic classic. Must see the Model of Supercroc Designed in the end of the movie. Wow What a great Supercroc.,1111708800,,595,5.144329896907217
1675055,5,B00005Y71O,"Although the focus of this program is Sarcosuchus, the fossil ""SuperCroc"" of what is now the Sahara, it includes a great deal of information on contemporary crocodylians through ""Croc-Hunteresque"" segments in all sorts of interesting places. Particularly striking are a night croc ""hunt"" in Costa Rica, and Adam Britton's unique method of inserting and removing sensors into and out of a Saltwater Croc's stomach (by hand - you won't believe it 'til you see it).
Recovering the animal's fossilized skull is covered at some length and in such a way as to convey the tension inherent in recovering such a heavy, cumbersome, delicate, and valuable chunk of rock without destroying it or hurting yourself. Paleontologist wannabes, take notes.
The now-familiar method of bringing extinct animals to life through computer animation is used, but it would have been nice if there had been somewhat more footage of this sort and it could have been more lifelike; say, something more like that in ""Walking With Dinosaurs."" Also, other giant crocodilians such as Deinosuchus and Purussaurus were never discussed. This is understandable, since it was about Sarcosuchus after all, but I, at least, would have welcomed some comparison.
Quibbles aside, it was well done and my kids and I still think it's a blast, even after watching it a half-dozen or so times. Now, if the traveling display would just come to Omaha. . . .",1059609600,7,1409,5.051502145922747
1675056,3,B00005Y71O,"The first few minutes give the impression of this documentary being a spoof. If this were not a National Geographic documentary, I'd still believe it was.
Details about the Supercroc are amazing and its ability to eat dinosaurs fully believable. Sadly, there were too few details about the 40-foot long crocodile; instead, the viwer is given a documentary that seems to spend about 90% of its time in praise of the amazing abilities of the people involved in the fact-finding required to link the supercroc to today's remaining species of crocodile. All could have been covered by a few lines of commentary explaining that there was detailed research on the likely similarities of size (and predetory instincts) of present-day breeds of crocodile and the supercroc: however, that was not the case; so be it! But, to collect the required comparative data, the crocodile-hunting scenes seemed so lacking in safety for the people involved that I remain somewhat discomforted about why National Geographic endorsed such amateur displays (including one crocodile hunter stepping on the nose of a crocodile and looking very fortunate indeed not to have become a crocodile meal!).
Praise is certainly due to the amazing sculpting of what the supercroc would have looked like in comparison to mere human beings but, overall, too much time was spent on looking at the self-glorification of the presenters rather than the awesome glory of the supercroc.",1018656000,22,1443,5.170940170940171

7956615,5,B00005Y71O,"Thank God that this creature does not exit today.  Our rivers and lakes would empty of life as we know it, these eating machines would devour anything edible.  Eventually they would most likely destroy their food sources, and starve to death..  Unless they allowed the native species time to regenerate themselves, they would not survive.  Human beings would stand little chance against these monsters.  It is definitely a good thing that these monsters were rendered extinct, they could not co-exist with the species living today.  A very fascinating dvd, and well worth purchasing, especially for its educational value.  JRV",1380844800,,626,5.262626262626263
7956616,5,B00005Y71O,"If you like prehistoric animals you will like this vid. The process by which paleontologists go through to reconstruct an extinct animal is shown in great detail here. The croc itself is absolutely astounding...40+ feet long and capable of eating a T.Rex, Sarasuchus was indeed a monster.",1377993600,,288,5.148936170212766

7956619,5,B00005Y71O,"This is a very nicely laid out point by point documentary, from finding the fossil to  making conclusions. I was pleased that the narration and filmed content meshed well.

7956620,5,B00005Y71O,"This movie is a great movie.  I use it for one of my classes.  The kids have stated constantly that ""it was the best science video they've ever seen"".  They enjoy it immensely and they never fail to get so engrossed in it that they jump at the part where the modern crocodile jumps out of the water at someone.  I've read the rather critical comments left by some of the less than educated reviewers (they can't write, spell, or write a complete sentence).  Quite frankly they seem rather baseless.  No one can get in a time machine and go backwards to see the real creature.  However, via Science everyone gets to learn how scientists really ""re-create"" these ancient creatures.  This is the part that the general public doesn't see.  Australians probably get a lot of info on crocs because they are native to that area but the rest of us like to see them as well.  It isn't a movie you watch to look for ""big kills"" (rather pathological to me) but it is a movie to watch to become better educated and better informed of the world around you.  But based on everything I seen, my students love it and find it very interesting.",1316217600,,1126,4.41747572815534
7956621,3,B00005Y71O,"This was one of the specials on prehistoric monsters released about the time of the Walking With Dinosaurs series. Compared to that,this is almost a bad cartoon. The CGI is clunky at best and does not even measure up to video game quality.
  The info itself is good and the views of the life sized statue in the making are very interesting. But anyone one looking for the quality we have all come to expect from our CGI dinosaurs will be very disappointed.
I rated this item 3 Stars because I did like the narrative and general content of this DVD.The animation is the singular flaw that keeps me from giving it 5 Stars. If you are getting this for a kid, 10 or under,they should enjoy it well enough.

7956622,5,B00005Y71O,"Paleontology has always been a competitive ""sport"" among scientists and enthusists. When a great discovery is made the person(s) will of couse 'beat their chests' and play the 'great white hunter'. And so they should. The fossiling they do at their level is dangerous grueling and full of highs and lows. Really, two movies could could be made, one about the discovery and the other about the life of the creature.",1233705600,,414,4.845070422535211
