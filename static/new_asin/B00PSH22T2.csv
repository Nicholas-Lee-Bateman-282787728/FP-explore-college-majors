Did not enjoy it and when I wasn't bored, was annoyed that I was still watching this nonsense.",1455494400,2,320,4.944444444444445

This company is dedicated to bringing independent, foreign, documentary and classic films to life once again for every film lover passionate about cinema. They lovingly craft DVDs and Blu-ray's in EXCELLENCE and they express the love affair that we all have with movies of all genera's

All I can say to start out with is I was utterly excited and absolutely fascinated and amazed and thoroughly giddy with excitement when I found out that Olive Films was releasing this wonderful forgotten piece of brilliance on a wonderful Blu-ray format and also DVD. This is one of those forgotten pieces of erotic fantasy, mixed with unrelenting nightmarish style, fever dreams of horror. This is one of those movies that leaves a lasting impression upon the viewer and is one of those movies that should be seen by any movie lover because it's such a unique and one-of-a-kind experience. I am so happy and elated that Olive Films graced this piece of erotic dark cinema with a new wonderful transfer and outlet to experience this weird, original, one-of-a-kind, black fever dream nightmare.

Part erotic, part nightmare, part horror and all original. A deep trip of insanity and the beauty of the erotic dark nature of forbidden lust and life. To me this is one of the best French avant-garde horror and mystery films ever to grace the cinema world.

This is directed by one of the greatest film directors of all time. Brilliantly gifted writer and utterly fantastic master of cinema and original unique and passionate pieces of film history, the one and only Alain Robbe-Grillet. Not only a genius filmmaker but what most know him for is his wonderful novels. His brilliant work in published books give him a heightened reality of pure genius in both book form and film form.

He created an atmosphere in his movies, of yes, voyeuristic, sexually erotic and of a provocative nature, but they were also a deep mind screw and a journey like no other. Olive Films has graced this twisted little masterpiece with a perfect Blu-Ray format (Also available on DVD).
