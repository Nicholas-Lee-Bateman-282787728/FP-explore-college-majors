The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Lauras books can see things that a teenager may miss. Their economic depressions are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events unsuitable for childrens books. Here are the titles of the 22 episodes.
