7875827,5,6304618107,"This tape was made in 1997 and it's a tutorial on how to watch basketball knowledgeably. It features Lute Olsen, at that time, the head coach at U of Arizona.  He shows a group of college basketball players from well-known teams. Each of the players is a specialist in a particular position and each explains the part he plays during the game. The player shows what he does and how he does it.  This is important because the swirl of bodies moving around the court can be rather difficult for a novice watcher to follow. It looks chaotic when in fact it is quite organized. Think of it as a ballet with a ball. At any given moment, only one player on the court actually has the ball, but the other nine are busy positioning themselves for what they expect to happen next. The transition from an offensive role to a defensive role can happen with startling suddenness.

They also use real refs explain how the referees operate and what to watch for.  If you like the game and want to learn more, this is a good way to do it. Now for the bad part, it was never put on DVD.  Don't ask why, it just wasn't. However, if you have a VHS player and want to learn more about basketball, this is a must see.",1305676800,,1197,4.255506607929515
