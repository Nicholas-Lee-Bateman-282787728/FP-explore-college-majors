3955758,2,B002N5N4NU,I find it inconvenient and distracting to have to return back to My Video Library every 20 minutes to proceed to the next episode.....even if it could function as a disc and  several episodes would play  continuously would be helpful.,1331596800,5,234,4.825
3955759,4,B002N5N4NU,"My husband recommend this series and it was surprisingly good. What's weird is that I actually tried to watch this series when it was on air and didn't think it was that good.  However, now that my brain is no longer consumed with images of ""Elaine from Seinfeld,"" I can actually enjoy this actress in other roles.  I'm really glad I gave this a chance because I laughed and laughed and laughed.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Very funny!",1307145600,11,450,4.463414634146342
3955760,5,B002N5N4NU,"Yet another great season of New Adventures of Old Christine!!! I cannot believe those idiots at CBS canceled this show after five seasons.  I guess crappy Reality shows are alot cheaper to produce.  Anyway, Season Five is another terrific season and if you love Julia Louis-Dreyfuss like I do, you will LOVE all five seasons.  I believe Season 2 is still the best season, but all five are great!!",1305158400,25,396,4.7101449275362315

I think I like her best in this series, ironically insecure and unlucky as a female lead.",1394064000,,509,4.183673469387755

3956025,1,B002N5N4NU,"I love Old Christine, and I bought the last 3 seasons on DVD (I already had the other 2) I already knew they were just DVD-R
But they don't have subtitles, or closed captioned.
And the presentation is pretty cheap (I don't care about this that much)
But reality is I want to watch this show with non english speakers or hearing impaired, and now I own it on DVD but I HAVE to watch it by myself, and if I want to share it I have to watch it on TV with subtitles, that's just stupid.
If you are going to sell me DVDs like this, (with nothing) make them cheaper paying 90+ bucks for the last 3 seasons is just way to expensive, the first two seasons are cheaper, presentation is better and have everything a DVD needs.
Great show, cheap treatment to it.",1369958400,8,751,4.1506849315068495
