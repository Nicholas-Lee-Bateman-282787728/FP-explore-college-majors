4328107,5,B004CRR9FG,"This is a great DVD. Informative and keep you interested. Great learning tool for children about birds. Shared this DVD with my 90 year old Mother, who has been interested in birds for a long time. She and I really enjoyed it.",1307923200,3,226,4.404761904761905
4328108,3,B004CRR9FG,"I expected more footage on the birds themselves.  I bought the DVD because I wanted to know about the behavior and biology of these birds.  There was some information on that, but not as much as I would have liked to have had.  It seemed to me that the scientists/researchers had more screen time than the birds. I wanted to see more birds and less reaction shots of scientists watching the birds.  More birds and less scientists struggling through the forests.

I've watched other PBS DVDs on birds and loved the Nature: Hummingbird dvd.  It also included a little more footage than I wanted to see on bird banders. But on the whole, the documentary achieved a good balance between the scientist footage and bird footage.  In Birds of Paradise, I felt like I learned more about the scientists researching the birds than I did the birds.",1302566400,73,837,4.653061224489796
4328109,5,B004CRR9FG,I am not a bird watcher but my father is and he loves these videos. The prior video on humming birds was pretty good. He treasures these DVD s.,1299888000,2,143,3.9655172413793105
4328120,5,B004CRR9FG,"The authors take you through their incredible years' long journey to capture these photos and increase our knowledge of these birds.  I am grateful to them for their commitment, skill and daring in compiling this masterpiece of natural history.  It is a ""must have"" for not only ornithologists and nature photographers, but anyone who enjoys looking at gorgeous photos.
The book is an incredible value considering its size and the quality of the reproductions.",1391299200,,460,5.202702702702703
4328121,5,B004CRR9FG,Saw this on PBS and couldn't wait to own it.  Watching these birds is magical and sometimes takes your breath away.  It would make a splendid gift for anyone who loves nature.,1389657600,,175,4.4375
4328122,5,B004CRR9FG,"Absolutely fabulous, in all ways!  Beautiful & interesting birds, scenery, photography, narration, information, etc.  Simply breathtaking. I've watched this a few times...enjoyed sharing it with family members.",1385596800,,210,6.7407407407407405
4328123,5,B004CRR9FG,Well done program about some of the most fascinating species on earth. A must see for bird and nature lovers.,1380844800,,109,4.5
4328124,3,B004CRR9FG,"This video seems to be an excerpt of other wonderful documentaries that the BBC has done.  As such, it doesn't have the sweep and polish of those other documentaries.  It's not awful, but if shelf space is at a premium, not recommended.",1377907200,,236,4.595238095238095
4328125,4,B004CRR9FG,"""Birds of the gods"" is a documentary narrated by David Attenborough. It follows a team of local scientists in New Guinea, as they attempt to find various birds of paradise and document their behaviour.

Perfect if you are a great fan of Attenborough, or love to see mating rituals of birds of paradise. If not, you might actually get bored after about half an hour, despite the spectacular displays of said birds. Weirdly, the male birds often display even when no females are around, suggesting that *they* don't get bored!

I thought this would be a grand treat, but I soon felt lost in paradise. Still, less than four stars feel uncharitable to the crew filming these strange refugees from Eden...",1374969600,,700,4.776859504132231
4328126,5,B004CRR9FG,The birds they discuss are magnificent.  I feel blessed to get to see them even if it is a video.  The dances they do are fun to watch and their colors and design are awesome.,1374105600,,175,3.9714285714285715
4328127,5,B004CRR9FG,"If you like the unusual and bright world of the birds, then thid DVD is for you NO parrots or the like but endangered and wild birds.
Really a great short movie. Thank you ,  flutterbee",1373932800,,185,4.138888888888889
4328128,5,B004CRR9FG,"I was dumbstruck by the remarkable film, especially considering how difficult it was to obtain. I cannot imagine a better introduction to the birds of paradise.",1369180800,,160,5.1923076923076925
4328129,4,B004CRR9FG,This is a digital restored version of a relatively old Nature episode looking at Birds of Paradise in New Guinea.  The bird lover loved it.,1368748800,,139,4.56
4328130,5,B004CRR9FG,"Absolutely loved this movie, plenty of information about the location history and current up to date facts on the Birds of Paradise.
Only thing I didn't like about this bluray is the Region A lock that was placed on it making it hard for me to watch this in Australia.",1367107200,,268,4.38
4328131,5,B004CRR9FG,Wonderful doc on the utterly unique and gorgeous Birds of Paradise and their incredibly elaborate mating rituals; Highly recommend it!,1365552000,,134,5.75
4328132,4,B004CRR9FG,The birds in this dvd are amazing. Birds of paradise do the most spectacular things. They are very well photographed.,1360972800,,117,4.9
4328133,3,B004CRR9FG,"I wish it had more bird footage and less people footage.

I have seen a very good video on cable but can not find it to buy",1360195200,2,123,3.5555555555555554
4328134,5,B004CRR9FG,"These birds are amazing - you wouldn't believe the personalities!  Well worth watching many times over, if you enjoy nature;",1359849600,,124,5.2
4328135,4,B004CRR9FG,"Awesome footage of both people and birds.  More birds!!!!  We watch these nature shows over & over, this one did not disappoint us>",1359244800,,131,4.6521739130434785
4328136,4,B004CRR9FG,"I ENJOYED THIS ON TV AND ENJOYED IT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN MORE OF THE BIRDS BUT CONSIDERING HOW RARE IT IS TO JUST BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AT ALL IS AMAZING. MY WIFE IS A BIRD LOVER AND SO WE JUST HAD TO ADD THIS TO OUR COLLECTION.

4328137,4,B004CRR9FG,But I am an avid fan of David and as usual the production values (whatever they are) and the close ups are great.,1355011200,,113,3.9565217391304346
4328138,5,B004CRR9FG,"First let me point out if you buy the video expecting to see nothing but footage of the birds themselves you will be dissapointed. These birds are hard to find and videograph. But you will get a well rounded and interesting documentary of the natives who live in New Guinea and how they relate to these magnificent birds.
The two researchers who are also natives, take one of David Attenborough teams to some very remote sites to see and record some of these amazing and other worldly birds. The love of the land, these two individuals have for their home is obvious and they make it their life's work to count and monitor the populations of these birds to determine what conservation actions are needed to insure these birds are here for future generations to enjoy. I wish I had the opportunity to join these two researchers on their quest.

Although I know this is not the forum for the recently released National geographic version I just wanted to add that having just seen it I personally found David Attenborough's version, much more interesting. Nat. Geo. version again does not have much video on the birds themselves, in all fairness, they are hard to find and take videos of (although the quality and shots of the birds are better compared with Birds of the Gods) you will get lots of video of the photographer and the videographer, either setting up cameras, facing hardships, not to mention girls hauling their equipment around. I recommend borrowing a copy of the Nat. Geo. version so you can see the awesome video (what little there is of it) before buying it. But ""Birds of the God's"" at least for me is a keeper, and one I will see again.",1354233600,2,1655,4.610169491525424
4328139,5,B004CRR9FG,"If you love birds, then you will love ""Birds of the Gods!""  I covers the some of the most beautiful species of birds on the planet!  I really enjoy the fact that David Attenborough interacts with nature in his documentaries.  He does not just narrate.  It is a wonderful learning experience of beautiful detail.  I would recommend this animal lovers and bird lovers alike.",1353456000,,372,4.75
4328150,5,B004CRR9FG,"Absolutely beautiful exotic birds, some I've never seen before.  It was amazing watching the people who devote their lives to carefully photographing while protecting these beautiful birds. Five stars!!",1334016000,5,202,5.9655172413793105
4328151,5,B004CRR9FG,"This DVD is excellent!  My husband and I watched it.  I love David Attenborough.
I'm a birder and this is magnificent! My husband just became one in 2006.
He loved is so much that he agreed when I immediately purchased it.
I dream of some day seeing these beautiful birds!  They are magnificent and beautiful.  The photography, narrator, and the way they put the DVD together is great!",1330387200,2,385,4.617647058823529
4328152,5,B004CRR9FG,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!  Very informative and interesting. Quality footage. Would buy more like this. My kids even got into watching.",1328918400,3,137,5.85
4328153,3,B004CRR9FG,"Very poor HD video and a few birds, I really do best videos here in Colombia and under budget.
I think it is widely used low-quality digital zoom the image.",1328832000,2,156,4.233333333333333
4328154,2,B004CRR9FG,"I was not happy with this at all, despite being a huge David Attenborough fan. From the beginning, way too much of the crew including extreme cleavage shots kids don't need to see. Greatly prefer the tried and true format of other Attenborough dvds with his occasional appearance and main focus on the wildlife.",1323388800,3,311,4.777777777777778
4328155,5,B004CRR9FG,"This blu-ray is about the various bird species of New Guinea, an island located in the Pacific Ocean.

Narrated by David Attenborough, there is a brief introduction to New Guinea tribes and their customs which threaten the survival of the birds.  We follow a native bird conservationist group which include locals, Miriam Supuma and Paul Igag, who go through great efforts to document and count the bird species.

New Guinea bird species are also called birds of paradise due to their exotic plumage and courting behaviors.

Here are the birds of paradise covered in this video.

King bird of paradise
Greater birds of paradise
Raggiana bird of paradise
Rifle bird of paradise
Black sicklebill
Lawe's parotia bird of paradise
Magnificent bird of paradise
Wilson's bird of paradise
Blue bird of paradise
Superb bird of paradise

As another person wrote, regarding wanting to see more bird species, I agree.  But I understand the need to highlight bird conservancy.

Video is under 52 minutes.  Options include English Subtitles, 5.1 Surround, Dolby Digital 2.0, and Video Description.",1322524800,31,1083,5.17816091954023

4328157,5,B004CRR9FG,"This is a wonderful video of very unusual birds. The selection and the drama to film them is incredible. I admire people that go into unusual places to film and take pictures for us to enjoy. Very well explained and the filming of these birds are just incredible.
If you love birds, this DVD for you.
I hope that you will enjoy it as much as we have.",1313020800,,350,4.161764705882353
4328158,4,B004CRR9FG,"This was a lovely description of each bird but I was wanting more specific research of each species. I've seen this same video before on PBS and knew that I wanted it for my collection. I am happy that I purchased it, but still wanted more information.",1311292800,2,252,4.382978723404255
4328159,5,B004CRR9FG,"Very informative, with an emotional edge. The awesome beauty of these birds, and the time and energy spent on
their displays, renders me speechless.  Good insight into what is done to protect and preserve them;  but also being sensitive to the traditions of the native tribes of the region.  I also possess ""Attenborough In Paradise"", which is equally spectacular.",1307923200,13,364,5.135593220338983

8423486,5,B004CRR9FG,"This footage is astonishing. I am not a birder. I speak as someone who is thrilled by wildlife and the beauty of nature. We have watched this at least 3 times. It is probably our favorite video, even over feature length Hollywood films. You will be surprised by the strangeness of these beautiful creatures and will wonder that they exist at all. Then you will want to jump on the first plane to New Guinea and sit in the rain for 3 weeks just to catch a glimpse of these marvelous birds.",1408060800,,488,4.315217391304348
