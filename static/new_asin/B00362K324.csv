4072105,4,B00362K324,"I purchased this DVD as I am a fan of Sam Elliott.  This movie has him as a sociopathic killer, which was a change.  He is such a good actor that he carried it off.  Instead of ending up liking him, you end up being scared to death of him.  Even then he knows how to turn on the charm.",1419724800,,285,3.7

4072111,5,B00362K324,I watched this as a 2 part TV movie in the late 80's!  I was completely mesmerized with Sam Eliot and his role. We watched it again after Christmas and I was just as interested as before. I wonder now where Hope Masters is today.,1325376000,4,229,4.088888888888889

4072113,4,B00362K324,"I have a toshiba DVD player (doesn't record or do anything fancy) and this is the only DVD that will not play in it.  By that I mean, it stops after the FBI warning at 18 seconds.

I read in the tech specs that tvm requires ""play only"" DVD's which is all my DVD player does.

I've tried every imaginable button on the remote, ""menu"", FF, RW, jump ahead to another track: nothing works.

I bought a simple DVD player that is play only and known to read discs others can't.  Death in California played flawlessly so I'm happy again.",1290816000,2,530,4.26

8389445,5,B00362K324,I am watching this right now. This is worth having a clean copy and worth to have in your collection. Sam Elliott is just as chilling as he was in Murder in Texas. Cheryl Ladd never disappoints and is a solid actress (which is lacking in every way in many films today). This was released in 1985 (4 years after Murder in Texas). The story is TRUE and the CASE will stun your entire experience as this truly happened. The cast was top notch and I would not mislead you for those who are authentic in collecting rare mini-series which were so well crafted that they deserved to be under the Warner Brother title. Warner Brothers does not disappoint and I am fine that there are 2 disc because of how mini-series were developed during that time. The acting will capture your attention through and through. A fine film to watch alone in the dark or on a rainy after noon. The actual criminal's name is G. Daniel Walker and I suggest that if you are able to purchase this version of the DVD to please take the time an add more to your research. It will not hurt to pick up a copy of a reasonable price as well as finding this DVD for a reasonable price. This is when mini-series were docudramas and not mere entertainment. Very scary story and just well worth your time. I cannot steer you wrong because the movie does well and holds up well enough to ask you to at least have this in your collection. G. Daniel Walker was a monster!!!,1438732800,3,1430,4.319702602230484

8389447,3,B00362K324,"I wasn't crazy about seeing Sam Elliott in such an evil role but he was very good in it.  As far as Cheryl Ladds Role, she was good too. But I hated her character.  She was soooo pathetic you just want to slap her. Not a happy ending kind of movie.",1426636800,,248,3.843137254901961
8389448,2,B00362K324,I am going to be returning this for a refund.  On the first DVD there is about a 15-30 minute span that must be scuffed because there is no sound and the picture stops and starts for the entire time.  For what I paid for a brand new DVD this should not have happened.,1425513600,,267,3.925925925925926
