An extremely entertaining, and thrilling horror film; reminiscent of classics, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",1470700800,,182,5.777777777777778
8759850,5,B01EZAR2RY,"I have to rate it 5 stars as I play a small part.:)
It is a good movie for this genre. It is a horror/slasher flick involving a group of young adults who become stuck in a small town.",1467158400,,183,3.717948717948718
8759851,5,B01EZAR2RY,"Surprisingly funny and scary! I literally jumped several times watching it, and that is a rare occurrence for low budget horror for me. Watching this is at least as fun as going to a really good haunted house, and much more affordable, and available all year. :)",1465516800,,262,4.595744680851064
8759852,5,B01EZAR2RY,This movie is amazing!  Lots of gore.  Creepy TX town.  This is a must have for horror movie fans.,1464220800,,98,4.052631578947368
8759853,5,B01EZAR2RY,"But it! Bottom line! This is one of, if not THE best B horror I have ever seen! It's a great story and never leaves you bored. Living in Texas I could totally see this actually happening in some small town. Very well done.",1463616000,3,222,4.068181818181818
8759854,3,B01EZAR2RY,"This is the best low budget film I've ever seen.  Some gore, some moments that make you jump and I screamed once lol.  I loved it and will watch it more than once.  The Gore is some of the best I've seen in a horror movie.  LOVED IT!  Randy Templin",1463616000,4,248,3.88

8759856,4,B01EZAR2RY,"The cool think about making a film is getting to see the reactions of other people. I wrote and directed this one, and I really do love seeing what people have to say. There are a lot of good reviews. There are a lot of bad reviews. I'm just happy people are watching the film. Does it have its problems? 100% yes. Is it still a pretty decent film? 100% yes. I'm pretty damn proud of everyone that helped to make this happen. Starting from absolutely nothing, and building this into something that is finally available to the public has been an amazing experience.

That stuff aside, this film centers around a few friends getting away from home for a vacation (yeah, it's been done), and an oncoming storm stops them in the town of Middle Spring for a night. The friends get picked off in some interesting ways by some folks that take the 'body and the blood' a little too literally. It's full of gospel and gore, and it centers around the lead couple who happen to be gay (not so often done).

I've been back and forth on how I feel about the film for the last 2 years. I've always been proud, but after all the cutting we had to do to pull the film in at about an hour and a half, I worried that too much story had been lost. Watching it over and over and over through screenings and reviews, I've really come to love this little film. People can say what they will about the film, but we put our blood, sweat and tears into it - literally. For anyone that thinks the film is an attack on Christianity, I will tell you that is absolutely not intentional. It is a look at organized religion from the outside from someone that has been beaten down by organized religion for being who they are. It just happens to translate into Texan better using the language and scripture we did (there is a lot of scary stuff in the bible).",1463616000,,1827,4.277456647398844
8759857,2,B01EZAR2RY,"Seven young adults get to stay in Middlespring, Texas known for religion and cannibalism as they ""cut through the lies."" The town is determined to save mankind one sirloin at a time. We find out it is written ""a man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables."" We also learn that the ""final girl"" can be a guy if he is gay.

The denomination and town in general was not well developed. The ""feeders"" needed a more detailed explanation. None of the kids had cell phones, so they didn't have to pretend they had no reception. If I was chained by the wrist to the wall, breaking my hand and wrist wouldn't be an option until I knew they were going to kill me. The acting was expected for a ""B"" horror. The dialogue was kept light to maintain interest but wasn't as funny to me as it was to them.
