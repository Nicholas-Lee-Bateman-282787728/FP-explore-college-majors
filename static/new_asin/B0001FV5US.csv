8011949,2,B0001FV5US,"This 2001 tape is meant as a tribute to Scott Hamilton on his last tour with Stars on Ice.  As most figure skating fans know, he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1999.  In this video, he looks tired and isn't quite his usual effervescent self, which while certainly understandable, does lend a bit of a downbeat note.  We all want to see Scott at his best and it's difficult and sad to see him otherwise.  In the 50 minute video, there are three Scott numbers, two Tara Lipinski numbers, two Kristi Yamaguchi numbers, one Ilia Kulik number, a forgettable Tara & Ilia duet, one Kurt Browning number, and two group numbers, the last of which is a sweet moment for Scott to say good-bye to his castmates. Doesn't sound like much does it?  Well, it isn't.  And that includes talky filler. Some of the early footage is a bit of a tease; for instance a brief clip of Kurt dressed in all black wearing a muscle shirt, but we never get to see THAT number.  One of the tape's highlights is a innovative group number where the cast uses chairs throughout the piece. It's modern and clever and stretches the idea of what figure skating can be.  That said, I watched this tape once - and that's enough.",1312934400,4,1202,4.431818181818182
