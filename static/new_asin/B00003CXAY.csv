I'll be trully thankful. And  let me add something more: don't forget its twin Powaqqatsi, another  delightful trip into man's nature. Same director, same musician, same  style, same image's pace, same poetry but even more focused on how people  live lives that most of us would hardly withstand. I highly recommend both  titles.

The cinematography coupled with the sometimes haunting and sometimes rapid music of Phillip Glass gives the viewer an almost hypnotic  experience. Time lapse fast and time lapse slow are blended together as  they tell the visual story of nature and man, life out of balance. The film  climaxs with ""The Grid"", a high speed acceleration of people,  autos, an unbelievably well written and performed music score, and a road  scene that would rival Steve Mcqueen's chase scene in ""Bulitt"".

1327952,5,B00003CXAY,"Last week, I watched for the firs time Qatsi trilogy, which includes the films Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, and Naqoyqatsi. All of the film titles are taken from the Hopi language; Koyaanisquatsi meaning ""life out of balance,"" Powaqqatsi meaning ""life in transformation,"" and Naqoyqatsi meaning ""life as war.

The films were made by Godfrey Reggio and the music score which plays as important role as the images do, was written by Philipp Glass.

The films have no spoken dialogue or plot and have to be experienced viscerally first, and then analyzed because everyone sees different in them. For some viewers - they are glorified long music videos, for the others - the revelation that may change the way we perceive ourselves as human kind and our place on Earth.

As for me, personally, I realized that the collaboration between Reggio and Glass may be one of the best creative unions between a visionary director and a brilliant composer ever.

Of three Qatsi movies, my favorite is certainly, Powaqqatsi,  and I know I'll come back to it many times more until my last day because it is not just a gorgeous movie with amazing images; it is one of very precious experiences that happen rarely in life. What made this experience possible is above all and without doubt the MUSIC. It was not the first music by Philip Glass I heard. I like his minimalistic and somehow disturbing scores that go right to your senses for ""The Hours"", ""Notes of the Scandal"", and ""The Illusionist"" (2006). Powaqqatsi was the second movie in Reggio's ""Qatsi"" trilogy for me. Just before it, I saw ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (1982) or Life out of Balance"", the first of three Reggio-Glass movies. I like ""Koyaanisqatsi"" very much but I think it is the images that make it so memorable. ""Powaqqatsi"" for me, is about Glass's magnificent, un-earthy, divine and literally uplifting and transcending score. It is the music that could've been played after God had finished his work of creation and looked down at Earth and saw that it was good. I am a music lover, and I love music of different genres, epochs, and cultures. I enjoy listening to Mozart and Beatles, Nino Rota and Metallica, Zamphir and Scott Joplin, Bob Dylan and Lucianno Pavarotti, Bach and Edith Piaf.  I love them all but I don't recall ever being so moved and taken out of this reality, feeling happy and overwhelmed, proud to be able to witness and enjoy the incredible achievement of human creativity and genius as when I was watching and listening to three ""Anthems""  and  ""Mosque and Temple"" scenes of ""Powwaqatsi: Life in Transformation"". I don't buy the DVDs very often, I am not a collector but when the movie leaves unforgettable impression, when it brings something amazing into my life, I have to have it. I already ordered and received both, ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and ""Powwaqatsi"" on DVDs and I keep rewatching my favorite scenes and the music has the same impact at me making tears of joy coming to my eyes every time I hear the majestic hypnotic triumphant sounds of music written by Phillip Glass.

I would like to add the words of one of my favorite writers. They match perfectly  the feelings and emotions the film has evoked in me:

""Mother Earth.  She lived, this world of trees and rivers and rocks with deep stone thoughts. She breathed, had feelings, dreamed dreams, gave birth, laughed, and grew contemplative for millennia. This great creature swimming in the sea of space.  What a wonder thought the man, for he had never understood that the Earth was his mother, before this. He had never understood, before this that the Earth had a life of its own, at once part of mankind and quite separated from mankind, another with a life of her own.""

1327956,5,B00003CXAY,"Koyaanisqatsi is what I would call an ""architectural"" movie (actually it is more of an artful documentary than a 'movie'):  Well-designed images of our world, and society's impact on the natural environment.

1328006,1,B00003CXAY,"...

These movies don't even come close to 'Baraka'. The images are of less quality and do not draw you in. The 'background music' has become a barrier between the images you see and the feelings they could have created. Instead of showing the images with the natural sounds that go with them, there's a feeling of disconnect as the eyes see one thing, but the ears hear other, unrelated, audio 'clues'.
Even though the director is Francis Ford Coppola, do not be fooled in expecting high quality. There is a strong impression he made the movie during his lunch hour while concentrating on another film.
Both movies suffer from the same visual/audio disconnect. If you want to spent the same amount of money in this category, but two 'Baraka' movies and give one to a dear friend.",1189296000,,780,4.6521739130434785

The movies are really in depth, and though my TV is not an IMAX it does give that illusion.  Really trippy imagry, and factual acts of life give these two movies a high rating in my book.",1178928000,,325,4.046875
1328009,4,B00003CXAY,"The theme suggested by Koyaanisqatsi is remarkably visible in the stream of imagery, making the documentary commenatary very informative and suggestive. Koyaanisqatsi held my attention, and presented itself not only as a work of art, but also as an informing work of art. Powaqqatsi did not appear so readily accessible in a thematic way. I found the imagery, though provoking and immediate, to be an unfocused narrative. What is the message? The title suggests a theme, but the train of images fails to synthesize a statement initiated in the title. Of course life is in transition. How does that interest me? As a single viewer, I wasn't as interested in the Powaqqatsi video as I was in the Koyaanisqatsi imagery. Creatures of the world, including humans, are parasitic? Perhaps the videographers should have included some vegetarian ""fare"" (offering a solution to our animal natures). Finally, Phillip Glass's stimulating soundscapes, poignant and haunting, make both documentaries worth the bother.",1178496000,,1003,5.3544303797468356
1328010,4,B00003CXAY,"Koyaanisqatsi WAS a great, unique piece of cinema, but does look visually and socially a little dated these days. The Phillip Glass soundtrack works beautifully with the time lapse scenes but after a while begins to grate...

Powaqatsi is based much more on the ryhthms of life and work in the developing world, but as opposed to Koyaanisqatsi's hectic time-lapse, it's so slow-mo and meditative that some viewers may find it the perfect thing to fall asleep too. Godfrey Reggio's original vision seems to have been a fluke - Cinematographer Ron Fricke made Koyaanisqatsi as good as it was, but upon seeing how depressing it was, he then made Baraka to improve on it. The third instalment in the series, Naqyqatsi, is best avoided or borrowed from the video library and watched on fast forward.",1170115200,6,794,4.881481481481481

Only using images and (specially composed) music they are able to give an account on life on the northern hemisphere (Koyaanisqatsi), the southern hemisphere (powaqqatsi) and the synthesis of both (naqoyqatsi).

1328075,3,B00003CXAY,"I bought the combo pack because it was about the same price as just getting Koyaanisqatsi alone, and since Powaqqatsi was the second of three in a series, according to the literature, and I remembered really liking the first back in the 80s, I figured it was worth a look.

It really didn't do it for me as much as Koyaanisqatsi, but to each his own. The video quality was better in many regards, however, since, I assume, there was a bigger budget for the second film... Frankly, I was also much more into all the scenery and what was done with it in the first film, not so much with the people pictures in the second, but for the combo price, I guess it's worth it over buying just the one.",1155772800,2,692,4.242424242424242

Philip Glass is one of the people behind this and well, I thought to check Amazon for this movie Koyaanisqatsi and discovered there were three in all in the Qatsi series, so, I bought them all and will enjoy them all again and again.

1328083,4,B00003CXAY,"The first film, ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" is superior, but the second film, ""Powaqqatsi,"" has many visually stimulating moments as well.  ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was a landmark film when it was first released, using time-lapse photography and other trick-cinematography to show the world in a new way.  There are many provocative moments, my personal favorites being shots of landscapes and night-time city-scapes accelerated.  The final shot of a rocket exploding is simply visceral to the point of being haunting.  I can still see the swirling, fiery image days afterward.  Now, for the second film.  ""Powaqqatsi"" has some amazing shots, as well, but it lacks the first film's unique originality, using many of the same techniques from the first film but with fewer jarring sequences.  However, the score to the second film is what really carries it to the end.  The music, in my humble opinion, is more memorable and gives a sense of worldly ambience.  Indeed, I loved the score so much that directly after watching ""Powaqqatsi"" I went on-line and purchased the CD.  As a combination, these two films are engrossing, dated here and there, annoying at times, but overall, emotionally moving.  What sold me on the 2-pack is the fact it's only a couple of bucks more for both.  To me, it was worth it.  It's like I got the second film as a rental that I never have to return.

Perhaps, I thought, being an idealistic second year Philosophy major made me believe something that wasn't really there: Life distilled into a shot of on-screen espresso.
No.  Twenty years later and the film is still relevant.  The wonderful cinematography and soundtrack combine in a synergistic dance that forces the viewer to contemplate their existence among the mighty forces of man and nature.
Powaqqatsi is no different.  The cinematography and soundtrack offer a stunning experience for the viewer to contemplate man's struggle with himself.
This DVD set should be a welcome addition for people who experienced Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi on the big screen. YMMV when you consider the experience in a movie theater vs. home theater.  For my experience, I had a 16 x 9 TV, and a very high-end sound system, a perfect pairing for recreating those feelings from 20 years ago.",1061164800,9,1048,5.105263157894737

Set to the rythmic music of Philip Glass we see images of empty spaces and the natural environment highlighted beautifully with time lapse photography. The images of man start to be included and increased over time until we see life in cities flashing past - the people become like ants. We also see images of mans destruction of the earth. Powaqqatsi follows with more images from around the world although I think that it is lesser in its ability to move the watcher.

1328110,4,B00003CXAY,"It is a remarkable achievment to create a film without any actors and without a storyline.. however, it tells the story of a beautifull planet which is rudely interrupted by a certain species known as Men. The message of this film is not very positive, destroying nature, life with stressy hasty people who enjoy to be amused, not to amuse themselves, yes, Life out of Balance! The title covers the subject. The film confronts us with the way we live. For example Scenes of rushing people interchanged with scenes taken in (foot processing) factories  Also the and of the film (Prophecies) is in its way very catchy, the black side of our sociaty with the almost sacred music from Profecies supporting it. The message behind Koyaanisqatsi is perfectly symbolised by the exploding space rocket at the end of the film.
The film is a hypnotic and impressive symphony of music and images. In my opinion, Philip Glass composed is first symphony in 1982 and not in 1987.
Last but not least a few words on the DVD quality. of course the picture and sound quality is much better then the VHS copy I already had. However in my opinion it could be better; the music is sometimes slightly out of tone especially at the end, a church organ sound is very sensitive to variaty in tape speed. The pictures are a bit reddish. That's the only reason to rate this film 4 instead of 5 stars. Geffry Reggio, Philip Glass and Ron Fricke did a outstanding job!",1041552000,2,1438,4.595330739299611
1328111,5,B00003CXAY,"too many people seem caught up in the imagery and soundtrack to this film. both are first rate. that isn't what the film is really about. i read one review here where the person didn't like the message! that really unnerved me a great deal. this movie is important precisely because of it's message. you don't like the message? too bad. don't go whining when you have no air to breathe, water costs $5 a gallon because all the chemicals we pump into the earth make fresh water a valuable commodity, don't go whining about how your children are born with birth defects because the govenrment is open to bribes from polluters. don't complain that you can't get a decent job because you have to compete with other humans who breed like rats and like you, prefer to bury their heads in the sand and chant the ""lalala this isn't happening"" mantra.
koyaanisqatsi should be required viewing in every school. it isn't mere preaching, it FACTUALLY shows you what we're doing to the planet that wants to give us life. we humans aren't nearly as smart as we give ourselves credit for. the fact is we are more ruled by our selfishness and shortsightedness.
things haven't gotten any better since it was made. they have gotten significantly worse. i can remember when winter was really winter. last year, it hit 80 degrees in february! that isn't right. with higher temperatures caused by MORONS IN SUVs who see nothing wrong with breeding 5-10 more morons to continue their ""traditions"", the earth will retaliate with increases in bacterial infections as has already been ducumented and killer bee swarms (that shouldn't even be here to begin with) will move further north.
the signs are here... we're just too ignorant to stop what we're doing. some people's answer... ignore the problem and kill the messenger. entire areas of coral reef that have lived for millions of years have died almost overnight because we have raised the temperature only 2 degrees in less than 100 years. things will get worse before they get better. destroy enough links in the chain of life... and there will be huge consequences down the road.
koyaanisqatsi is a film WAY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME. there was really no talk of global warming back then, and there really still isn't even now. i agree with my DVD's caption: ""until now, you've never really seen the world you live in"" the problem is, flawed human nature prevents anyone from seeing anything that they don't want to see, especially if it makes a person question themselves. humans are very resistant to introspection, and are always looking for someone else to blame. everybody wants to pretend they're perfect, but none of us are. regardless... we really do need to start doing things differently and stop hiding from the truth because it's unpleasant. the truth really can hurt you, especially when you refuse to confront it.
that is what koyaanisqatsi does and why it's so important, not the terrific soundtrack... and not the sensory overloading visuals... it's the message ""this is what YOU are doing to the world you live in"" this film has inspired me to give up on automobile ownership for good. i now commute by bicycle or mass transit. i'm actually surprised that i get resistance from cashiers for wanting to re-use old shopping bags. i get annoyed by whiners who complain that tree huggers are robbing them of their cushy jobs destroying the planet.... to bad! get another job... preferebly in recycling or farming.
koyaanisqatsi is a film about the unstoppable momentum of human apathy and devotion to ignorance. it's the only series that i know of that's brave enough to slap people in the face with their own shortsightedness with something even more powereful than words that can be debated by reactionary circular logic. it confronts us with images that can't be explained away by anyone claiming to be a rational person. the ONLY things wrong on this planet, are the direct result of humans. it's too bad that as a person... this fact might hurt your feelings.
animals are actually much smarter than us... because they know enough to play by ""god's"" rules. we humans are so full of ourselves that we think we have a better way... we don't. ironically enough... the simple life really is better. faster living creates new sources of stress. fact: on average... hunter gatherer societies need only work 3-4 hours a day... think about that when you're stressed out at your second job so that you can pay for the SUV that you can't really use to run over those little japanese cars that dare to get in your way making you road rage.

1328112,5,B00003CXAY,"""Koyaanisqatsi"" has held up well over the years since I first saw it at the cinema. Its images were almost all as powerful via this DVD as I remember them having been 20 years ago. Those that have worn a little thin--notably the transition from a satellite view of a city to an extreme close-up of a computer chip--have done so because they have been so often imitated and repeated since ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was first seen.
I found ""Powaqqatsi"" less riveting on this first viewing than ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" but noticed that it resonated longer in my mind and provoked more thought and conversation later. Its images and ideas have remained with me for weeks now.
The ""Qatsi"" films are unique works, neither documentary nor entertainment in the strict sense of either term. Nor are they mere visual social commentaries. The music of Philip Glass, the amazing, often context-less cinematography, the editing, and the philosophical underpinnings that drive the enterprise, all combine in a work that defies categorization but can't fail to stir the viewer.
The DVDs each contain a commentary section featuring writer-directory Godfrey Reggio and composer Glass. The commentaries provide some concreteness in the vast abstraction of the work, but I made the mistake of watching the ""Powaqqatsi"" commentary before seeing the film, and it diminished the film's impact. I recommend savoring the films themselves at least once before going to the commentaries.",1039824000,43,1444,5.228448275862069

The musical score is perfection, as is most of Philip Glass' work......bought the re-recorded cd along with the Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi 2 pack offered here at Amazon.com",1037923200,2,425,5.159420289855072
1328135,3,B00003CXAY,"After reading the previous review from the gentlemen who owns an IRE special edition of Koyaanisqatsi I suspected they must have done the same ""image cropping"" to Powaqqatsi.
Well, after comparing the Powaqqatsi DVD with an old VHS edition published back in the late 80's I can confirm that in order to go from 4:3 (VHS) to the 16:9 format of the DVD they simply cut the top and bottom part of the image. The DVD does NOT show extra stuff that would come from a wider picture.

Very stupid I think. The movie was probably shot in 4:3 originally.",1037145600,24,545,4.45
1328136,3,B00003CXAY,"Actually, the film was indeed released as 1.85:1 threatrically. I saw it on its original run in the theater ""way back when"" and later, ran it myself as a projectionist for the Nuart in LA. That print, too, was a 1.85:1 print (complete with printed masking). So, the DVD release is not a cropped version. He may be confusing Koyaanisqatsi with an IMAX film, Chronos, directed by Ron Fricke who was DP on Koyaanisqatsi - that film was 4:3 - the IMAX aspect ratio.
However, I cannot, as of yet, rate the quality of the DVD because I have not yet seen it.",1035849600,18,551,4.359223300970874
1328137,2,B00003CXAY,"The quality of the picture is much less than any DVD I've seen before.  Indeed, dust and scratches appear throughout both DVDs.  I'm a big fan of both of these movies, but the DVDs just do not do them justice both in terms of video and sound quality.",1034467200,17,250,4.1875
1328138,5,B00003CXAY,"After reading a few reviews, I'm a bit confused, but I enjoy this 1.85:1 LBX because Ron Fricke's photography is all-consuming. I, too, saw this in theatres (""Koy"", had to wait for ""Pow"" on DVD). The best thing about these DVD's is the side-shows, namely, the documentary interviews with Reggio & Glass. The films are riveting, and speak for themselves. One important thing Reggio said in the interview is not to ask why you're watching these films, but to relax and let them take you in. Reggio had an idea, and ran with it.  ""Koy"" was mostly centered in the American West, and, to me, basically said that what God has created is still there but man's already changing his ideas about how to make it better. Reggio also said that ""Pow"" takes place in the Southern Hemisphere, though most of the locations were Egypt, Nepal, Hong Kong, etc. The most stunning thing about this second film is the joy of life that surrounds these ""backward"" cultures. Who's to say what's ""backward""? The important lesson is that technology could destroy eons of precious culture that exists simply because man hasn't been around to screw it up. Indeed, the photography in ""Pow"" (by Graham Berry & Leonidas Zourdoumis) seems to focus on brilliant colors and has less of the fast-forward stuff used in ""Koy"" by Fricke (suggesting that these are more relaxed cultures). The photography in both is exquisite, as is the music of Philip Glass (though it was more computer generated in ""Koy"", and a bit repetitive). My biggest argument with the DVD would be that I've been interested in some of the locations, and a commentary track would've been appreciated. These are films of great importance and influence. Reggio's first idea was sponsored by Coppola, long a fan of independent ideas. The second was by Coppola and Lucas, and I noticed that Soderbergh is mentioned as co-producer of the third, ""Naqoyqatsi"", as yet unreleased. Since ""Koy"", I've noticed the Reggio/Fricke influence in many of the commercials on TV. (Yes, I watch TV!).I like these films; they're thought-provoking and, somehow, visualize ugliness in the most beautiful way. Let them take you away.",1033776000,8,2142,4.917127071823204
1328139,5,B00003CXAY,"The arrival of these films in DVD format after a long and painful journey thru legal limbo is a joy to behold.  Koyaanisqatsi is truly one of the most visually stunning films of all time, but that isn't it, no far from it.  In addition to Reggio and Fricke's breathtaking visuals, one is further blessed with the genius of Philip Glass' score. The sections of the film can be hypnotic, jarring, humorous, heartbreaking, puzzling, or strange, and what one takes from the film isn't set in stone, but its guaranteed to challenge the viewer in the best sense of the term.
Its Sequel, Powaqqatsi is no less ambitious and no less  phenomenal, shifting to the ""third world"" and slowing down the visual pace of much of the film (literally).  It also features what is perhaps Philip Glass' most powerful music ever (matched in ambition and scope only by his Opera Akhnaten).
Words must enevitably fall short to fully describe these films though, for if a picture is worth a thousand words, these films provide thousands of pictures for us to contemplate. A Definite ""must own""!!",1033516800,12,1070,4.767567567567568

1328141,5,B00003CXAY,"Although some people are quick to point out that the MGM version of Koyaanisqatsi is improperly matted to 1.85:1, who really cares? If you are a fan of the 'qatsi films, then you are well aware that they have been out of print (unavailable to the public for purchase or even rental) for a LONG time. I have long been trying to obtain a bootleg, or even laserdisc copy of the films. On ebay they usually went for upwards of $100 a copy. When I heard that MGM was releasing the films on DVD, I was estatic, and after watching them at home on my TV, I am even more happy.
Koyaanisqatsi is a love-hate film; you either love it, or hate it. For me, the brillance of Koyaanisqatsi comes in the juxtaposition of it's imagery and film score. The imagery is stunning: beautiful yet disturbing at times. The filmmaker Godfrey Reggio gives the viewer imagery and lets them make their own decisions about ""what it means."" This renders Koyannisqatsi a film where the viewer is quite active. If you do not like to think, or do not like abstractions you will most definitely not enjoy these films. If you enjoy thinking, and want to watch an experimental film that will leave you thinking for weeks, if not months afterwards, I can't recommend this film more.",1033171200,13,1244,4.508849557522124
1328142,5,B00003CXAY,"My father introduced me to Koyaanisqatsi.  He gave me a copy on VHS and told me it was a ""coffee table"" film - the cinematic equivalent of a beautiful picture book that you pick up every so often and enjoy flipping through. He was both right and wrong.  Yes, it presents striking images and music void of narrative, character, dialog, or traditional 3-act structure - but by no means is it for casual browsing.  Koyaanisqatsi is, in fact, the essence of ""pure cinema"" - a work of art that simply could not exist in any other medium. It is as arresting, lyrical, awe-inspiring, emotionally satisfying, and intellectually challenging as any film could be.
To try describing it further would be folly, about like saying that the Mona Lisa is a piece of stretched canvas with dried, oil-suspended pigments stuck to it. As director Godfrey Reggio says in a wonderful interview included on the DVD, an audience gets from it what they bring to it.  More than the sum of its parts, Koyaanisqatsi is an evocative and haunting meditation on nature, technology, social politics, mass media, consumerism, pop culture - and perhaps whatever else you care to read into it.
Long unavailable, it is gratifying to see both Koyaanisqatsi and its sequel, Powaqqatsi finally offered together on two magnificently produced DVDs.  What can be said of one film can be said of the other:  they are the same, yet different, like two movements in the same piece of music.  One film complements and expands upon the other.  Where Koyaanisqatsi seems preoccupied with the technological revolution in the so-called ""first world"" and its devastating effect on the Western psyche, Powaqqatsi is its inversion - a celebration of rich cultures and vivid lives led by people paradoxically struggling under the burden of crushing poverty in the Third World.
Taken together, the films seem to suggest a philosophical conundrum: comfort, wealth, and ubiquitous technology spell the death of the human soul - while societies in transition from agrarian to technological, despite horrendous conditions and back-breaking labor, are fertile ground for authentic compassion, artistic expression, and spirituality.
But again, words are inadequate.  Minimalist composer Philip Glass' score, fused with cinematographer Ron Fricke's brilliant images, waxes far more eloquent on these matters than I could ever hope to in this review.  For the price, these two DVDs are a rare bargain for those who appreciate fine art.  For students of cinema or would-be film makers, they are essential.",1032652800,,2541,5.143203883495145
1328160,3,B00003CXAY,"... and we all know what ""sound and fury"" signify, don't we?

The first two-thirds of Godfrey Reggio's ""Life"" trilogy are stunning sound-and-light shows, but anyone looking for real content should probably go elsewhere.

With respect to _Koyannisqatsi_, Philip Glass's score is the film's high point; it's a landmark of contemporary classical music.  You could watch this film with the picture off and not lose very much.  Reggio's photography is breathtaking, although the uniform beauty of his images tends to overpower any statement he intends to make with them.

Reggio's second project, _Powaqqatsi_, is in the same vein as _Koyaanisqatsi_, though it's a much slicker product overall.  The Glass score, though uneven, has moments of greatness; again, it's a milestone of American classical music, and the highlight of the film.  But the images have dated very badly.  I suspect the film is borderline racist as well; Reggio and Glass reduce residents of the Third World to ciphers in a grand argument against globalization -- which, unsurprisingly, also contains an anti-American component.",1031875200,4,1095,5.362573099415204
1328161,5,B00003CXAY,"I've been a fan of both movies for a long time, and have seen Koyaanisqatsi performed live a number of times.  I heartily recommend that if you have a chance to see a live performance, you go - far more intoxicating than having the soundtrack come through the theater's speakers.
You can read more about the content of the movies elsewhere in here, so I won't get into that. FOr my money, the music of both movies - which is quite different - fits perfectly with the on-screen action.  The frenetic pace of Koyaanisqatsi's car ride saddled with the frenetic music is a real trip, and when it finishes, and goes back to slow, there's always a sense of relief and a sigh of ""Wow - I've not been breathing!"" from the audience.
I have played both of these movies as part of my church's movies series, hitting mainly the topic of stewardship (of our resources and our bodies and our neighbors), which is, for me, the message that I take from these movies.  Of course, there are many other messages, and being purely visual without dialogue or story, one can see and find many, many areas of discussion.
These are two powerful movies, that at least for me, after seeing them, my thinking about life and the world and people and consumption was forced into a more sensitive-to-others and sensitive-to-me approach.
Watch these movies, and you will be moved. Even my mother, who absolutely abhored Philip Glass, sat through Koyaanisqatsi with me and thought it kinda cool and wasn't put off by the music as she otherwise would have been.

The DVD I received from them is in every way superior to any home-video version heretofore on the market: the 5.1 sound is smooth, wide-range, gutsy and detailed (remarkable, considering its age!); the colors are vibrant -- in fact, I was noticing subtleties of color I'd forgotten were even there; the picture has depth and excellent resolution.

Years later I stumbled across Koyaanisqatsi in a now defunct Blockbuster Video store and was mesmerized.  Imagine my horror when some time later it was pulled from the shelves and taken out of print.
Anyhow, to make a long story short these two films are a must-see for anyone who is into views of the world captured on film that are far from the mainstream.  Some have criticized these films for being 'cultish' or being for 'college students to watch while stoned' (both of these two views are, in my opinion, a compliment).
But to me they are glorious, mesmerizing, and hypnotic.  Koyaanisqatsi takes place solely, I believe, in the United States and spends more time filming things then people.  Powaqqatsi spends more focus in other countries and spends more time concentrating on the people.
The blend of music and film without dialogue and without 'plot' (though there is a 'plot' but it is more thematic then it is linear) is brilliant.  I have been able to watch these repeatedly and every time I am moved in different ways and pick up things I missed on previous viewings.

If I didn't see the film myself in the late 80's and didn't have the fantastic soundtrack by Phillip Glass sitting right infront of me, I wouldn't believe this film ever existed. Very rare on video (only seen it shops once), never released on laser disk, hasn't appeared in the Rep Cinemas, and definitely hasn't been released on DVD...yet. Baraka borrowed very much from Powaqqatsi but in my opinion is not as cohesive. Powaqqatsi is as much a flowing masterpiece of audio and visuals as Koyaanisqatsi. Phillip Glass repurposed much of the score for KUNDUN from Powaqqatsi. I'm not sure why Powaqqatsi has been so hidden and not widly released, especially with the popularity of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka.

1328190,5,B00003CXAY,"I have seen Koyaanisqatsi twice on the big screen.  It plays occasionally on PBS.  The most fantastic experience I ever had was in the mid 80's when there was a showing of the movie at Royce Hall, at UCLA in Los Angeles, California.  The soundtrack was performed live by a small orchestra and chorus, directed by Philip Glass.  I was glad I had already seen the film because I kept getting caught up with watching the performers and Mr. Glass.
Koyaanisqatsi is one of the most damning commentaries on the beauty of our Earth being destroyed by the whims of mankind.  The theme of ""life out of balance"" applies to almost every member of the human race.  We have/are destroying our environment with the filth that we spew into the ocean, the air, and the earth.  Our current government policies are sending us down the slippery slope of denial.  I cannot remove myself from the list of offenders as I live in suburbia with my toilet, garbage disposal, automobile and trashcan adding their measure of pollution that the Earth suffers from.  What is the answer?
Koyaanisqatsi asks the questions, but humanity needs to provide the answers.  The images are gorgeous, even the ones of destruction; the soundtrack is compelling.  If you haven't seen Koyaanisqatsi you will recognize it's influence on the media when you see the time-lapse photography, and skillful editing.

I was flipping through the channels when the time-lapse photography caught my eye.  I didn't know what I was watching, but as I continued to watch it became apparent that this was much more than just a collection of neat-o film clips.  It contained a message about the earth and man's effect on it...but more than that it really conveyed a feeling of tremendous interconnectedness...  By the end of the film I was very moved and impressed and vowed that one day I would have a copy of the film for myself so I could show others.  Since then DVD's have become popular, and I can't imagine a more fitting film for the format.

I get to travel a lot in the southwest, and when I see that landscape I think of the film.  And this is good.
When I hear of a new shuttle launch there is brought back up for me the super-super-slow motion, interrupted view of a rocket launching pad being blown to smithereens by the phenomenal force of a rocket's thrusters in a time frame so slow that I was given a lot of time to wonder ""What in the world is being destroyed here!!?""
The message is clear I believe, and I do not belive it is just ecological.  The holding of a hand of a human being in a hospital bed is one of the tenderest images I have seen - and the holding could not have been done from one of the cars caught in the jerking, frazzling pack of traffic.  The message intended, I believe, is the english translation of the Hopi title word - Life Out of Balance.  I appreciate very much, however, not being clubbed to death with the message.

1328221,4,B00003CXAY,"I bought the DVD version of this seminal film from IRE (Reggio's organization) for the US$180 (the cost of the donation for the ""premium"").  I find this film remarkable.  Ron Fricke's camera work was truly ground-breaking, and Glass' score is unparalled.  While Reggio's ""innocent eye"" and the films overly-moralizing tones are dubious, _Koyaanisqatsi_ is still a landmark piecein film history.  Academicians such as Scott MacDonald and others have reviewed this film and its impact on the visual culture proceeding from its release (Fricke's signature work coopted by so many different ad houses and Hollywoods film shops).
Regarding Glass' new release of his soundtrack, the film (and DVD) still incorporate segements of music that remain unreleased on the audio albums (sections covering the introduction to L.A. and prior to the first machine/human shots at about ~30 mintues into the film).  The DVD has everything in original.  Essentially the DVD is a digital rip from the projected film.  It contains film scratches, and the original score by Glass (not refurbished in any way).  The picture quality is good, but reflects the film transfer (still better than any VHS version i've seen).  However, the DVD palys the film in stadard TV aspect and not the letter-box aspect associated with films.  Having never seen this film in the theater i cannot say if this is true of the original projection.  However, after watching it about thirty times (for a semianr paper), and in comparison to the VHS edition, the DVD is a superior product.
For the true lover of Reggio and Fricke, the DVD version from IRE is a must have.  Nor VHS copy can compare (nor will a VHS copy last under playback!).  The price is daunting - but if it matters, the DVD arrives in a sheath that is signed by Godfrey Reggio ( a real signature, not reproduced).  Moralizing aspects aside, not since Vertov has the ""documentary"" been pushed as far by an American Cinematographer (though others since its realese have gone further in other directions, for instance Trinh Minh Ha).  The DVD is a ""must-have"" from those who consider this film important - either academically or aesthetically.

1328248,5,B00003CXAY,"""Koyaanisqatsi"" is not a common type of film. There really is no narrative to progress the story, no script, no characters. A film that atleast wants to succeed at any level would have one of those.  The whole  point of ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is to show what the world has become,  either through the eyes of an environmentalist, or, what I really believe,  a Native American. It shows how the world has become mechanically  programmed, where everything everyone does has some relation to technology,  and sooner or later, everyone's a soulless robot. It shows its point very  well, but just through that one vision, which I really have no problem  with.
 ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a film that does not need a  narrative, characters, or even a coherent story of any sort. The film is  filled with vivid, breathtaking images, from the beginning of time, to  today. After countless viewings, some of the beautiful, illusional images  still remain a mystery to me. The style in which Godfrey Reggio films this  documentary is very professional and fascinating for its topic. At one  sequence, his camera slowly moves through the mountains as their color  changes at dusk, and in the next, it races through the city of corporate  business.  Another major key that helps shape this film is Philip Glass's  exceptional score. His music captures the mood of the light and dreamy  images to the solid realism. I enjoy Philip Glass's works off-screen also,  but when he composes for film, it immediately becomes a great and  unforgettable soundtrack. He did it in this, Paul Schrader's ""Mishima:  A Life in Four Chapters"", and Martin Scorsese's ""Kundun"",  and they are all among my favorite soundtracks. People tend to generalize  his music too quickly, saying that it is awfully too monotonous and  redundant, and I can understand that, but for the films and the type of  music he composes, that works perfectly. His melody is so well-established,  it needs to be heard many times to be fully absorbed. He uses the strings,  synthesizer, and choir all very wisely in this film. The soundtrack is  definately one of the important factors of the film.
Like said before,  there are very few films similar to ""Koyaanisqatsi"" that succeed  at a level of brilliance through simplicity. Music, photography, and a  moral, which is pretty much justified at the beginning, is all this film  has. I have seen this film countless times for many years, and yet it makes  a powerful impact every time I see it. It grows onto me in different ways.  Some might, however, disagree with the entire moral and say that the film  is self-indulgent and pretentious. That is understandable, but I believe  that ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a stunning work of art.",961632000,,2708,4.90929203539823

The only real way to  experience this movie is on the big screen, but now that DVD has made  wide-screen format sharp enough and beautiful enough to preserve the  original visual intent of great cinematography, Koyaanisqatsi should be  released on DVD. Where is it? It's time to see this film in its original  glory - even at home. This is one of the films I've been waiting for.

1328253,4,B00003CXAY,"Koyaanisqatsi is a very moving film consisting of powerful visual images set against the music of Philip Glass.  It is not a movie with a story or a plot, but an art film with a message about the dangers of unheeded progress that ignores the laws of nature.  The word Koyaanisqatsi is from the Hopi Indian language, and means ""crazy life"", of ""life out of balance"", and Life  Out of Balance is the sub title of this film.
The film opens with scenes  of nature filmed in time lapse, then gradually moves into man's world.  The  scenes convey both beauty and ugliness at the same time, and take us to  airports, freeways, skyscrapers, the comings and goings of people,  microscopic views of integrated circuits contrasted with satellite views of  cities, and the eerie ghost town images of the failed Pruit Igoe housing  project.  The film concludes with Hopi prophesies warning us of the dangers  of taking too much from the world, and even of nuclear holocaust.
Even if  you disagree with the message of the film, the visual images and the  artistic vision of the film make it well worth seeing.  If you are a fan of  Philip Glass' music, then that is an even more compelling reason to see it.  If you don't like Philip Glass, then watch it with the sound off.  I once  saw this movie with the Philip Glass ensemble performing live at UCLA's  Royce Hall.  It was a very deeply moving experience, and one of the most  profound live performances I have been to.
Sadly this beautiful film is  out of print, but it used to be available on VHS, and may still be lurking  in some independent video stores.  If you find it, then rent it, and if you  see this playing in a revival house, then go way out of your way to see it.  This film is not for everyone, but if you have read this far, you will  like the movie, and kick yourself if you miss a chance to see it.  Hopefully it will be released on DVD, as that would be a far better medium  for this film than VHS.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: KOYAANISQATSI + POWAQQATSU a The power of art is its mystery and the meaning is in the eye of the beholder. So when I make a film I think of it as a ""trilectic"" relationship of image, music, and the viewer. If there are a hundred people that see this film in a theatre at any given time, then there could be a hundred different points of view about it. Says Director, Godfrey Reggio.

Arrow Academy has released Godfrey Reggios first two classic films KOYAANISQATSI which is a Francis Ford Coppola presentation + POWAQQATSI is a Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas presentation together on this 2 Blu-ray discs for the first time. Here we have stunning gorgeous looking films such as these could well be what the Blu-ray format was invented for. In characteristic Arrow Academy style, the release comes with a wealth of brilliant extra special features. These include: a whopping stunning 72-page booklet, featuring a number of essays and a collection of contemporary reviews, as well as filmed interviews with Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass, and the directors 1992 short Anima Mundi. All this is very much welcome as neither film contains a single word of dialogue and you could quite easily end up wondering what they are all about.

Both films have been given names in the language of the Hopi people of the South-western United States. Qatsi means life, and Koyaanis means craziness or turmoil, while powaq means sorcerer. So, KOYAANISQATSI translates as a life out of balance and POWAQQATSI means life in transformation, which is also the subtitle of each film and the first film KOYAANISQATSI came out in 1982 and looks at America. POWAQQATSI came out in 1988 and focuses on the developing world.

Both films present an extended montage of the natural and human worlds, set to pulsing, rhythmic music by Philip Glass. KOYAANISQATSI starts with a stunning sequence of images of the natural world, often out in the deserts of the South Western USA. The colours and textures are rich, both landscapes and individual features form intricate patterns. KOYAANISQATSI was filmed by Ron Fricke, who went on to make the gorgeous montage films BARAKA and SAMSARA. The film takes its time, lingering over the almost abstract beauty of the desert, yet there is a sense of anticipation. Something seems to be brewing out of this vibrating, bubbling concoction of images.

It is humanity that we are waiting to see. When, after almost 25 minutes, we are finally introduced to people, the film becomes more emotionally complex. Cities: beautiful, wasteful, diverse, cruel and unequal, and ultimately the site of so much of the richness of human activity. Sometimes Godfrey Reggios camera looks down from above (well, especially from a helicopter) at the folly of humanity trapped in office blocks and traffic jams. This is balanced by catching people close up, often staring straight into the camera somewhat similar to a Bill Viola video installation.

POWAQQATSI begins in the Brazilian open cast gold mine Serra Palada made famous in Sebastio Salgados photographs. Thousands of men slathered in blue mud, carry bags filled with ore up a slippery maze of paths to the top of a vast crater. Here, as well as the despoliation of nature, Godfrey Reggio seems to be focussing on human suffering. The film takes a world tour of human toil, sometimes shocking and at others beautiful. We see the strange beauty of crowds, high rise buildings, religious ritual and even circuit boards, the ballet of ordinary life, and throughout it all faces, faces and more faces.

Godfrey Reggio was brought up in a religious household and left home at age 14 to join the Roman Catholic monastic order of Congregation of the Pontifical Brothers. Until the age of 28 he spent his time ministering to Latino gangs in the barrios of New Mexico, so not too far from the Hopi reservation in Arizona. It is easy to see Reggios roots as a man of faith in both the meditative and moral force of these films. With its church organs and sonorous chant-like vocals, Philip Glasss music adds to their liturgical, hypnotic effect.

In an interview with The Guardian, Godfrey Reggio has acknowledged the influence of one mentor, friend and genius, and is the Armenian docu-poet Artavazd Ashoti Peleshyan. A little known figure, and started making documentaries in the 1960s and coined the term distance montage, to describe his technique. This is quite a complex concept, but roughly means the montage expands to include the whole film rather than just segments of it, and all images are equally important to the whole. Further, in distance montage sound and image merge to form a sort of synaesthesia where images can be heard and sound seen. This all goes to create what he calls absent images in our minds. However, his work, unlike Maya Deren's, is not avant-garde, nor does it try to explore the absurd. It is also not really art for art's sake, like the work of Stan Brakhage, for instance, but is generally acknowledged, rather, as a poetic view of life transferred onto film.

Phew! As director and composer Gary Tarn puts it in his introduction on the Blu-ray disc, we are left to draw our own conclusions. We are indeed, but it is hard not to feel that nature is beautiful and human beings are at once abusers and the abused, and that life is not just in transition, but horribly out of balance. Still, the voyage is beautiful as well as shocking, and possibly something else as well. Quite what that might be, Godfrey Reggio, and his mentor Artavazd Ashoti Peleshyan who would probably not want us to pin down.

Blu-ray Video Quality  KOYAANISQATSI: The film has been framed at its theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and is presented in a stunning 1080p encoded image. The film KOYAANISQATSI first half is softer than the second half which at its best can look strikingly sharp and with excellent and natural colour saturation levels. Major clean-up has been done to the film and the bonus features containing clips from the film show a much dirtier picture, and the transfer is spotless. Black levels aren't very deep.

Blu-ray Video Quality  POWAQQATSI: This film follows its predecessor at a 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio and faithfully produced in a 1080p encoded image transfer. Sharpness is a bit more consistent here than in the previous film, but even here there are sequences that are softer than others. Colour is a touch brighter than in the previous movie with reds registering especially well but never blooming. Skin tones are completely natural throughout. Black levels are no better than in the first film in the trilogy.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  KOYAANISQATSI: The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack features Philip Glasss moody, eccentric, and wildly innovative score to great advantage with perhaps a noticeable tendency to emphasise the front channels and let the rears receive somewhat less emphasis. The films are, of course, mood pieces and thus not narrative films containing dialogue or sound effects, apart from the mixture of voices over the closing credits. The music is lush and vibrant, and Philip Glass's music scores are not used to enhance specific episodes; they serve as foundations for the entire films. In other words, dynamic movement is balanced and carefully directed. The original 5.1 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original DOLBY LTRT magnetic tracks, as well as some re-discovered original outtakes. As to the audio issues such as clicks, thumps and audio dropouts were manually removed.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  POWAQQATSI: Once again, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix offers Philip Glass inventive, eccentric music in a fully realized surround interpretation. There are a few more sound effects here than in the previous film, a waterfall, voices chattering and a vocalist near the films end, and these effects also come through clearly and distinctly. As to the music score of POWAQQATSI is also of epic proportions and vibrant performance, and Philip Glass's music score are not used to enhance specific episodes; they serve as foundations for the entire films. In other words, dynamic movement is balanced and carefully directed again and again. The original 4-channel discrete soundtrack was remastered in 5.1 surround at 24-bit from the combined original mix magnetic tracks and the DOLBY LTRT. This 5.1 mix was created in 1999 by composer Philip Glasss music director Michael Riesman. Once again, as to the audio issues such as clicks, thumps and audio dropouts were manually removed.

Special Feature: Introduction by filmmaker and composer Gary Tarn [Black Sun and The Prophet] [1080p] [4:45] Gary Tarn who quickly explains what makes Godfrey Reggio's KOYAANISQATSI a really special film. Despite its relatively short running time, this introduction is very insightful and gives the viewer a very good idea of what to expect as regards to its non-narrative structure and its fusion of visuals and sound.

Special Feature: Essence of Life [2002] [1080i] [26:00] Director Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass discuss the production history of KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSU, as well as the concepts and ideas behind the two documentary films. Director Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass discuss also address the different interpretations of the two films could inspire, and with the interviews, are accompanied by shots from the two films, and it is clear to see the passion with which both were made. You see how the evolution from idea to finished product work with Director and Composer working in harmony with each other and is very interesting and essential viewing. It is the same documentary feature that also appears on The Criterion Collections Blu-ray release of KOYAANISQATSI.

Special Feature: Impact of Progress [2002] [1080p] [26:00] Interviews with director Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass on the making of KOYAANISQATSI and POWAQQATSI.

BONUS: Beautiful Illustrated collectors 72 page booklet entitled Two Films by Godfrey Reggio featuring new writings on the films and there is seven separate categories, which includes Nature Disrupted, Modernity Defamilirised: Reggios Docu-Diptych of Changing Times by Anton Bitel; Contempary Reviews; Untold Tales of Koyaanisqatsi by Ron Gold; Glassfilms by Michael Brooke; Francis Ford Coppola by Peter Cowie; Anima Mundi by Jean-Baptiste Gouyon and About The Transfer.

Finally, beyond the two films and their respective documentaries, the jewel in this collection is the inclusion of the Anima Mundi 1992 documentary, with collaboration between Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass produced to celebrate the World Wildlife Funds Biological Diversity Campaign. With some jaw-dropping wildlife footage and check out the sequence with the hyena charging through a blurred pack of panicked pink birds, coupled with a thrillingly evocative, percussion-led score, this 30-minute walk on the wild side is a must-see for music, documentary and nature fans alike. most importantly, these are films that were meant to be seen as films and these director-supervised transfers are an essential improvement from the previous inferior DVD incarnations. The exquisitely shot footage is more emotive in high definition as the texture and feel of the film stock is more pronounced. Whilst screenings of the films will pop up occasionally, this is the first chance many will have to see them as they were intended. Plug in the big TV, hook up the surround sound; experience real cinema. Highly Recommended!
