3911879,5,B002DMJM1G,"it was a great buy!! My son loves it and it is very educational. These are the kind of cartoons that are not a waste of time, kids learns. So i love it and would recommend it",1367107200,,174,3.72972972972973
3911880,3,B002DMJM1G,"You can buy the individual dvd's and get a better price, so unless you're interested in paying more just for the multi-set packaging, I'd go with the individual dvd's.",1365724800,,167,4.793103448275862
3911881,4,B002DMJM1G,"My two-year old daughter is a huge Diego fan, and for awhile was trying to make sure we all knew that she was Diego.  She's past that now, and is happy to just watch him rescuing baby animals on his missions.  So we got this for her for a Christmas present and she is thrilled, needless to say.  In fact, I'd call her a Diego addict.  I have to monitor her Diego time otherwise she would literally conk out in her chair watching this kid, and she screams and kicks like a crazed maniac if you try to pull her away, which she's never done with anything else in her life. Makes you wonder if it's healthy.  What do they put in this mix?

As for my own personal opinion, I find the constant upbeat music and chatter a bit annoying after awhile, and each episode seems to go on forever... half an hour per rescue extraordinaire, which makes it difficult to intervene for a snack, a diaper change, a meal, or anything for that matter. Each DVD is 95 minutes long, and there are three episodes per DVD, so you have to jump in quickly to stop it before the next story, but you're in for a LoooOOng wait if you start at the beginning of one of them.  Then you find yourself humming the songs and can't get them out of your head (""Say CLICK! Take a PIC!"" Ugh!)

Finally, I thought Diego was pretty cool at first with all his amazing safari and wild animal adventures, and hoped that it might be a fun way for the little one to learn about nature, but I am feeling pretty let down that they use a lot of magic and voodoo (literally) for some of these stories.  Some of it is pretty weird, like the one about rescuing the elephants.  They also try pushing environmentalist and climate change agendas on here, and I think it's pretty uncool to slip controversial and scientifically unproven political views onto little kids... especially my own (this was specifically on the one about the polar bears, which by the way are not endangered and have the largest populations in history presently).

My daughter's Diego addiction began innocently enough with a ""gateway cartoon"": ""Dora the Explorah"". Now Dora is passe and boring by comparison, but both of them use lots of hocus pocus bologna. In spite of all that, dear daughter is learning about some wild and exotic animals she wouldn't otherwise be exposed to, I mean, how many two-year olds do you know who know what an okapi is?  I don't know many adults who do.  So I suppose I'll indulge her for the time being.",1358208000,2,2453,4.400442477876106

3911884,5,B002DMJM1G,"Got this for my 2 year old daughter and she loved the DVDs. Not too surprising, considering she seems to have a big crush on Diego. Bought them to keep her occupied on her maiden flight from Chicago to San Jose and they did the trick. Good worth for the money I paid.",1309910400,2,267,4.056603773584905

3911886,5,B002DMJM1G,"It's one of the few kids shows, other than Little Bear, that I let my children watch.  Teaches values, shapes, really basic problem solving.  I'd recommend for age 2-4, especially boys.  It's a bit annoying to listen to if you are a parent, however.",1265155200,3,249,4.613636363636363

8365478,2,B002DMJM1G,"Nothing personally against Diego...but I was very disturbed to hear so many people talking about such small children (even babies!) watching so much tv at one time. My 8 year old still likes Diego...but very young children and babies shouldn't be watching tv at all. It's very bad for their eyes and their minds, is linked to causing ADHD and other learning problems. Just saying...do your own diligent research about the negative effects of tv on young children...and then maybe tell 'em a story, sing to them, or take 'em for a walk instead.",1409529600,,543,4.787234042553192
