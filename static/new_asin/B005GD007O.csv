4690097,1,B005GD007O,"um wow got this for $5 shipped and felt like it was such a waste. I had a 7, 5, 4 and 2 year old watching it and it was soooooo boring...I came to make a review and was surprised it got such great reviews...In all fairness we didn't finish it, but still 17 minutes in and I could hardly bare to make them watch any more of it...",1329868800,5,328,3.7681159420289854
4690098,1,B005GD007O,"I watched this video for the first time with my children and was thankful that I did. This video does not teach that God created the world in 6 days. Mr. Visher insinuates that God probably used the Big Bang or some type of evolution.  Our family is a huge fan of the Veggie Tale videos so I had high expectations of these videos, but unfortunatly I will not be allowing my children to watch any of them.  Our children hear enough lies and compromise about the Bible from the secular world,  they do not need to hear it from a place that is claiming to tell them the truth about it.",1328227200,33,582,4.178571428571429
4690099,5,B005GD007O,"I just purchased this movie and the 6th movie in the series.  Both are absolutely fantastic! They are very professional, top quality movies and they TEACH so much more than ANY movie I have tried.  These are bar none, the best kids Bible education videos on the market.  They're very in depth (for a kids movie) discussing things like where does the Bible come from, why some versions are different than others, and what sin is.  The movies all have the same formats, there are recurring puppet characters, animated characters from the actual Bible, songs by The Bentley Brothers, and Phil Vischer himself also is in every video.  The puppet characters are very cute and entertaining with their funny accents and sense of humor.  The whole movie is suitable for kids and adults, it has that special appeal to cross ages.  My nearly four year old daughter, is thoroughly engaged the entire time and has already learned new things and cemented things we've been reading in our Jesus Storybook Bible.  If you're concerned about how the movies handle all the killing in the Bible, it's very straightforward and not at all frightening.  I can recommend these videos 100% to all ages, toddlers to adults.  They are worth their price and then some!",1326758400,24,1241,4.811320754716981
4690100,5,B005GD007O,"This video was given to our family by my sister. My 5 year old wasn't too sure about watching it, but after the first time (because it was the only DVD that would work that day) he has watched it everyday since and asks in the morning if he can watch it when we get home from school. It is a great introduction to the Bible, to God, and it is very informative. Things I didn't even know! Highly recommended!",1326758400,3,407,4.1
4690101,5,B005GD007O,I was amazed at how much detail these video go into. The Children ranging from  age 4-10 all love them. I thought the older kids would think the puppets are too babyish. They do complain when the puppet sing but other than that they love these videos. My children have learned so much and thanks to the Christmas video can articulate where all of the Christmas traditions come from including Hanukkah. A great resource for church or small groups! I have also had success using them with lower educated teens.,1326153600,2,508,4.644444444444445
4690102,4,B005GD007O,"**updated review**
We now have DVDs 1-4 of this series-

I was really excited to get these DVDs for my kids. I had heard good things about them.  I have a 7.5 year old boy, 5 year old girl, and 3 year old boy.

The good:
--These are very educational. . .they go into a LOT of details about scripture (like ""What's the Septuagint?"")  I am a former Bible college student and learned things from these DVDs I didn't know!
--There are some catchy songs and cute puppets.
--It is well made.
--The kids have asked to watch these over and over.
--They are very educational and entertaining for mom and dad too!

The bad:
--Most of the characters talk w/ accents  (there's a few British accent puppets, a ""Southern"" one, and a few others).  The PROBLEM with this is that, while the characters are entertaining,  my kids could NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND what they were saying.  They talked too fast and w/ the accents,  some of the material was lost in translation.
-- It is much more like a morning news show (think the ""Today show"")  -  with scenes flipping back and forth between characters and topics and songs. . .  It's not really a MOVIE or cartoon.  So my younger kids really got a little lost while watching.

Overall-  i think these DVDs are probably better for older kids (not kids under 5).",1324944000,14,1288,4.44017094017094
4690103,5,B005GD007O,"EDIT:

In response to some of the concerns I've seen raised, I wanted to present portions of the video's dialogue so that parents can make their own decisions about the content of this particular show.  I would hate to see anyone miss out on this valuable resource because they were scared off by a couple of opinions.

I personally find this DVD to be extremely sound Scripturally, and I think it handles potentially sensitive subject manner in a very balanced and non-divisive way.  However, please don't take my (or anyone else's) word for it.  I have taken the time to transcribe the exact portions of the show that have ruffled some feathers.  Read through the content for yourself and see if it is offensive to you.  If so, you will likely still love the remaining volumes.  But chances are very good that you will find these issues to be of little concern.

*** CREATION EVENT TRANSCRIPT ***

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
[Concern raised by some: Usage of the words ""big bang"".]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Chester: In the beginning there was nothing but God, no planets, no stars, no trees, no iguanas, no toaster ovens, no kids, no eyeglasses...

Buck Denver: Chester!

Chester: Nothing!  Just God.  And then... He created.  He spoke, and the universe came into being.  (He must have had a loud voice because it made a big BANG!)  Heh, heh, heh... get it?  Big bang?

Buck Denver: [Stares at screen - not amused]

Chester: (still chuckling) That's an astrophysical joke.  Anyway, the earth was formed and cold and water appeared.  Then God caused the plants and the fish and animals to pop up.  And then He said, ""Watch what I'm going to do next. This is going to be great!"" And boom!  He made man and woman.  (They didn't have any clothes so they had to stand behind bushes whenever anyone took their picture.)

Buck Denver: What?

Chester: You know, for kid's Bibles and stuff.  And creation was done!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[My take: In it's context, it seems clear that this was intended merely as a harmless (and quite witty) quip, not an endorsement of the scientific theory.  It also is clear that God is given total attribution for the complete creation event.  It actually seems to diffuse the explosive nature (pardon the pun) of the topic by addressing it.  This way, children will actually have a light-hearted and God-centered frame of reference when they hear it discussed in science class.  All the while, those who actually believe in this particular scientific theory are not belittled.  I found the handling of this actually quite brilliant.]

*** CREATION ""DAYS"" TRANSCRIPT ***

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
[Concern raised by some: Introduction of both young earth and old earth concepts - the two prevailing viewpoints held by millions of Christians worldwide.]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Chuck Waggin: Hey Y'all!  When did all this happen?  When did God make the world?

Sunday School Lady: Oh, a long time ago.

Chester: In a galaxy far, far away!

Buck Denver: Chester!

Chester: Sorry.

Clive: I heard somebody say the world was 6,000 years old.

Ian: I heard someone say it was 4-and-a-half billion years old.

Clive: Woah!  That's a big difference!  Well, who's right?  Which is it?

Announcer: And now, it's time for ""Tricky Bits with Buck Denver""!

Buck Denver: Woah! Hey, wait... I'm not getting involved with that one!  [Walks off set]

Announcer: And now, it's time for ""Tricky Bits with Phil""!

Phil Vischer: OK, here's the deal.  Not all Christians agree about everything.  And, this is one of those things that we don't all agree about.  And it all comes down to one word: ""DAY"".  [Cute background music begins]  We believe Moses wrote the book of Genesis and therefore wrote the story of creation.  Now we know for sure that Moses was not around when God created the universe.  So, somehow God communicated this story to Moses and then like the other authors of the Bible, let Moses choose the words to tell the story to the people around him.  So, why did Moses choose the word ""DAY"" when he described God's creative activity?

Well, some Christians believe he was actually referring to ""earth days"", 24 hour periods, the amount of time it takes the world to rotate once.  Now if that's the case, it means God created everything from the big bang to Adam and Eve in 144 hours.  So, the earth couldn't be more than 6 or 7,000 years old.  But other Christians believe Moses wasn't talking about earth days but ""God"" days.  You see, God is beyond time.  He created time.  And the Bible says that to God a day is like 1,000 years and 1,000 years is like a day.  So some people believe that a ""God day"" could be thousands or even millions of years.

So which is it?  Which is right?  We don't know.  And sometimes that's OK.  You see, the book of Genesis wasn't written to tell us the ""how"" of creation.  It was written to tell us the ""Who"" of creation.  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

Buck Denver: [Spoken to side]  Is he done yet?  I'm glad I didn't have to take that one.  Hmm?  [Turning toward camera]  Oh, I'm on?  Ahem!  So, what happened to Adam and Eve?  We left them standing in the bushes with no clothes.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[MY TAKE: As you can see, the video doesn't take sides, nor does it indoctrinate.  It simply presents both schools of thought in a fair and concise way.  At this point, parents can step in and share their own personal view.  Trust me, kids will be exposed to much more grievous issues than this in the course of their childhood.  At least Phil Vischer is preparing children for the potential of hearing viewpoints that may differ from their own, and helps them to see that it is OK to keep their own opinion, while not demanding that everyone else conform to their particular view.  In this day and age, I welcome a good-hearted discussion of our differences with an example of extending grace to those you may disagree with while being given a road-map for finding unifying points with others.]

-------------------------------------------

Well, that's it!  Beside these two (apparently) hot topics, the rest of this video, as well as the entire series simply gives kids a general overview of the stories and key points of the Bible in a humorous and entertaining way.  Hopefully that will alleviate any potential concern about this wonderful product.  Or, at the very least, it will help you make an informed decision.  We now bring you back to our previously posted review.  :-)

Oh, and for those still debating, I'd recommend checking out the sample videos posted on their website: whatsinthebible.com/video

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I can't tell everyone enough how thrilled we have been with this video series.  Every episode is brilliantly produced and extremely entertaining.  Most importantly, this series has caused our children to have a deep love for the Scriptures and their conversation is now FILLED with discussions of Godly concepts and biblical stories.  (I will also note that we are not currently in a church setting, so this has been their sole source of inspiration in this area - besides dad and mom, of course.)  It really warms our hearts to see our children so enthralled with the Bible and so eager to learn more.

These videos have made providing our children spiritual nourishment EASY!  (Now, if only getting them to eat their vegetables were as simple!)  :-)",1323648000,238,7852,4.423265592151367
4690104,5,B005GD007O,"Our grandchildren just LOVE this series. It's wryly funny, lively and chock-full of rather detailed and sophisticated information about the Bible. As my daughter said on Facebook, ""I can't believe I'm listening to a pirate puppet explain the apostolic succession!"" We all learn something! Well worth the price!",1322438400,5,310,5.479166666666667
4690105,5,B005GD007O,"I bought this as a fun video for my boys (ages 7 and 8) based on the songs by the Bentley Brothers , and I had no idea it would be packed full of such amazing information.  I will absolutely purchase the other titles in the series, and I would love to see some curriculum published to go along with the videos.  These would make fabulous homeschool or church curriculum starters!  And, the Bentley Brothers do not disappoint!",1321315200,15,425,4.423076923076923
4690106,5,B005GD007O,"The What's in the Bible? DVDs were created by Phil Vischer, who created VeggieTales. I think these are even better than VeggieTales! My kids absolutely loved the first one and begged us to go out and buy the rest! They are funny, smart and your kids will learn so much (you probably will too). DVD 1 is about the Bible as a book and introduces Genesis. The music is the best too! Once you see the first one, you'll want them all!",1320883200,5,429,4.2439024390243905
4690107,5,B005GD007O,"My boys constantly surprise me with facts and knowledge about the bible that isn't commonly taught, but important. I absolutely recommend these movies. They were recommended to me,c and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",1495929600,,225,5.277777777777778
4690108,5,B005GD007O,"These movies are awesome! My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES watching them almost as much as she loves watching Mickey Mouse (that's HUGE!) and asks me to put on her ""Bible Show"" all the time. I catch her singing the songs when it's not on and telling me (and anyone who will listen) how ""God made all the creations""! This is an awesome supplement to our everyday Bible story time and prayer.

Coming from someone who spent years studying at a well known Bible college, I can attest that it is loaded with clear, accurate and understandable doctrine. It also very clearly explains the plan of salvation and our need for salvation as humans in a way a child can easily understand.

So far I have only purchased the first 2 volumes which brings us through creation, the exodus from Egypt, Bible layout and church history and weaves salvation throughout the story. I will definitely be getting the following volumes as she grows. Right now she loves watching the same episodes over and over which is perfectly fine when she is memorizing such critical content as this!",1494374400,2,1063,4.648936170212766
4690109,5,B005GD007O,"We love this series, it gives the kids family friendly viewing while educating them on the bible. I'm so happy amazon has it!",1493942400,,125,4.478260869565218
4690110,5,B005GD007O,"We love this series! My 8yo really enjoys it, but it's a bit over the head of my 4yo. He still enjoys it a lot though.",1493164800,,118,3.576923076923077
4690111,5,B005GD007O,"This is the best series! My kids were never Veggie Tales fans but they instantly loved these videos around age 5 and still love them at age 9! The other day I asked my son if he wanted to watch the Lego movie or What's in the Bible and he chose What's in the Bible! When I showed him the new one we finally got, volume 13, he exclaimed, ""Yes!""
These videos really help teach the Bible in an entertaining way that keeps children's attention- and they do learn from it and retain the information! It's a great supplement to what they're already learning at church and home and also a great introduction for kids who are not familiar with the Bible.
They're a great length for children to watch in the car or while you cook. We don't watch a lot of TV and movies in our home but when we do, What's in the Bible DVDs are definitely in the regular rotation!",1492646400,,852,4.201219512195122
4690112,5,B005GD007O,I bought the entire series for my son. He's learned so much. From the printing press to the books of the Bible these little video clips teach a lot. Goes into a timeline and how things happened. These have become a nightly bedtime watch. Well worth the time and money.,1491609600,,268,4.38
4690113,5,B005GD007O,"Part two of this video is better than part one for my grandchildren ages 6 and 7. They get bored watching part one and they don't watch. Part 2 is great, though. We watch and sing the songs. I have been watching with my grandchildren since they were three and four. It was our first bible program. I think it's a good fun way to teach them about the bible.",1489190400,2,356,4.1
4690114,4,B005GD007O,"Very good, but not quite up to Veggie-Tales standards.  Minor quibbles: Some of the characters are hard to understand, and there's too much rapid-fire switching between the characters.  Overall, well worth the price.  I've probably learned just as much about the history of Christianity as my kids!",1488240000,,298,5.297872340425532
4690115,2,B005GD007O,"I was pretty disappointed with this one.  My kids and I both enjoyed the Christmas video. https://www.amazon.com/Buck-Denver-Asks-Call-Christmas/dp/B005FQZMK2 so I thought this one would be good too.  I hesitate to say anything negative about Phil Vischer, I'm a long time Veggie Tales fan for one thing.  But in this case there was way too much of him just talking, and my kids asked me if they had to keep watching it.  To which I said no.  But they did finish the video, just clearly didn't enjoy it as much as the Christmas one, and I didn't think it was as well done.  Not to mention his whole cop out surrounding the 6 day creation/evolution.  I mean, what's in the Bible?  A 6 day creation.  If Phil thinks that ""6 days"" doesn't mean ""6 days"" he doesn't have to start telling my kids that they can't believe what the Bible says.  What are my kids going to take away from this?  That the Bible isn't reliable and it is up to them to figure out what believe and what to dismiss?  No need for that Phil, the title is ""what's in the Bible?"" not ""what's out of the Bible?""  Just tell the stories and tell us what is in the Bible and leave your commentary out of it.",1487548800,,1167,4.347222222222222
4690116,2,B005GD007O,"I really hoped my kids would like these videos. Unfortunately, the beginning of the videos is so annoying. The second part of the video is better but they can never get past the first part.

They received the first three volumes several years ago but were lost in the shuffle of a new baby followed by a move. Last year they were discovered by my four year old granddaugther who loved watching them.  Now the older brothers ages 11 and 13 and baby 18 months all enjoy them.  Not only that but the family plays them on trips because even mom and dad like them.  The reason for this order is that my daughter happened to mention that her children were wondering if there were volumes beyond one through three. What a thrill for this grandmother that these children love learning ""What's in the  Bible"".

I had to open up the bible with my kids and read genesis one and explain that God's word is clear about 6 day creation. Also, it pushes a lot of over emphasis on the ""free will"" of man in such a way that it makes it seem as if God is not sovereign. The video even said that ""god took a risk"" when he put the tree of good and evil in the garden. This is biblically inaccurate and borderline blasphemous to portray god in such a weak way. I wish the video would stick to a literal interpretation of Genesis and tell the bible stories rather than indoctrinating little minds with confusing wrong teachings.",1437350400,5,749,4.28169014084507

This does not teach a bible story to your kids.  It is mostly commentary on the author, history, and how the story fits into the bible as a whole.  VERY LITTLE time was spent actually reading/telling the scripture story that each DVD is named after.  It is accurate information, but not at all what I was looking for.  My children thought it was boring and confusing...and I did too!  The commentary was way to advanced for my preschool and elementary aged kids...perhaps more appropriate for Junior or Senior High School.  The fast-paced skipping from different finger puppet characters was spastic and dizzying, not attention grabbing, in my opinion.  The worst part is I didn't open the DVDs to start watching them until a month after I ordered them and so I can't return them.  :(  I will keep looking for a different resource for my kids and try to donate this to someone who will like it.",1432166400,,1028,4.538043478260869

4690204,5,B005GD007O,"It's no secret that I've been a fan of Phil Vischer's VeggieTales series for years.  So when he announced a new, thirteen part video series called What's in the Bible? I had to at least give it a chance.  For some reason, I wasn't sure if I would like it, so it was with a little fear that I stuck Volume One - In the Beginning, into my DVD player.  It wasn't long before I was smiling, nodding my head at some things, and learning a thing or two myself.

This series isn't just another collection of Bible stories.  The purpose here is to give the overall frame work of the Bible so kids (and the adults they hang out with) will have the context for those stories in the greater plan of God's salvation.  It is also designed to give us answers to bigger questions about the Bible.

But it doesn't happen in a dry, lecture format.  This is Phil Vischer, after all.  Instead, we've got a bunch of oversized puppets that are there to guide us through the videos.  Our host is Buck Denver, a news reporter.  Most of the content comes from Sunday School Lady and her magic flannel graph.  There's a piano playing priest and an African American pastor.  British brothers (and explorers) Clive and Ian contribute.  Then there's Popsicle Puppet Theater and the pirate who knows church history.  Phil Vischer voices all the characters, but he also appears as himself throughout the videos when it is time to explain things that are a little more complicated.  Throw in a few songs, and you've got a fast moving, highly entertaining debut.

This DVD features two 25 minute episodes.  The first one is background as it sets out to answer the question what is the Bible.  (And there's a great segment where a scientist conducts tests on it to try to answer the question.)  It talks about the number of books in the Bible and how they are divided up.  There's even some discussion about the Catholic Bible and why it has more books than the Protestant Bible.  All that is done with humor and facts, explaining why it is included for some and not for others.

Episode two delves into who wrote the books and how the books for the Bible were chosen.  And we also finally get into the Bible itself as we overview the first eleven chapters of Genesis in about fifteen minutes.  As you can imagine, we don't get into too many specifics.  The point of these videos isn't to retell all the stories in great detail.  Instead, it's to give the context of the stories, in this case the set up of man's rebellion against God and how bad it gets so quickly.  We even discuss why God made man with free will.

These videos obviously won't be avoiding controversy, since episode two tackles the questions of how old the Earth is.  Like with the number of books in the Bible, it explains the two different interpretations of ""days"" in Genesis 1 fairly and evenly, not making judgments but explaining the two sides.  Unfortunately, at one point during this mini segment, Phil says, ""God told Moses what to say and let him chose the words.""  That's going to be a rather controversial statement for those (like me) who believe that God inspired the words and not just the thoughts.

Frankly, this brings up my biggest piece of advice for these videos - watch them with your kids, at least the first time.  There is a lot of deep stuff here as well as some difficult stuff addressed.  You'll want to know what they are learning so that you can help answer questions that arise.  While that above paragraph represents the only theological issue I found in the 50 minutes, you should also watch them so that you can teach discernment and going to the word of God instead of videos for the ultimate truth.

I've mentioned a few times that I was really entertained by this disc.  They included plenty of jokes and silliness along the way.  They cut back and forth between characters quickly to ask and answer questions.  Really, you are getting a college level course in the Bible in a much more entertaining fashion in 50 minutes.  When this one was over, I was ready to sit down and watch the next one immediately.

The one statement aside, I was blown away by how much content and fun was packed into the 50 minutes that was volume one of What's in the Bible?  I still don't see how they will cover everything in thirteen discs, but I will be along for the enjoyable ride.",1429660800,,4340,4.47515923566879
4690205,2,B005GD007O,"But it was just too much flipping back and forth for my 5 year old. She couldn't understand the accents on the puppets so I had to keep reiterating key facts.  She liked the music but had no idea what they were talking about.  I think almost 45 minutes went by before we even got to Adam and Eve.  There are so many ""extras"" with the puppets that it detracted from the fact that we were trying to learn about Bible characters.  As an adult, I actually learned a lot but there is no way I want to sit through another hour of those puppets.  The best parts were when Vischer talked directly. She was interested in what he had to say an could understand him. I wish it could have just been him talking, and then the creative dipictions of the stories from the Bible. If your kid is under 6, I would say wait a bit. I will give the second video a chance, but I'm only going to rent it for $1.99 online instead of wasting money buying it.",1429574400,,933,4.104395604395604

4690224,4,B005GD007O,I like it.  I think it's way over the head of 4 and 5 year olds.  It's also too much information for one sitting.  Definitely would be good in segments within Sunday School or Children's Church.,1425945600,,194,4.333333333333333
4690225,4,B005GD007O,"My family absolutely loves the 'What's In the Bible' series.  My heart overflows when I hear my three year old son telling me what he has learned from the videos!  He loves the music and all the characters!  We love to watch these as a family. I have also found this to be a helpful resource with my children's Sunday school class.  We have started giving them as gifts for our children at Christmas and their birthdays.  We especially love the 'sing through the Bible' DVD that compiles all the songs from the series!  My son has asked for a Bentley Brothers cake for his birthday :). Thank you all so much for the time, effort and love you out into this.  You have blessed my family beyond measure and I am recommending the series to everyone I know!",1425686400,,752,4.366906474820144
4690226,3,B005GD007O,"I love that we can support such a great organization and effort to present God's word to children.  However, my kids (and even we, the parents!) have a hard time understanding the puppets!  What I mean is, their voices are mumbly...muddy and hard to understand.  You have to see the video a few times before you really can put together what they're saying.  The content is FANTASTIC!  I just wish the diction was clearer so it could be comprehended easier.  Great effort and well-done otherwise.",1425427200,,495,4.764705882352941

4690230,4,B005GD007O,I love the honesty and straightforwardness of this series.  A seemingly growing trend is to water down the Word of God in an attempt to reach our children.  It is a huge disadvantage for our children because then their walk with Christ begins without the proper weapon - God's Truth.  I love how What's in the Bible? does not avoid God's truth while using fun-loving characters.,1424908800,,378,4.696969696969697

4690233,4,B005GD007O,I appreciate how they handled the age of the universe. Fair and balanced. Kids should not be sheltered to only one theory. It's important to believe one but be aware there's other opinions. Otherwise their faith willt be damaged when they go off to college.,1424476800,,257,4.733333333333333
4690234,5,B005GD007O,This is a really great movie! Its a bit long for my two and three year old to sit through but my five year old loves it (although my two year old is a big Rhett and Link fan and was thrilled that they made an appearance in it). Its extremely informative and even my husband and I learned a lot. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn about the Bible and the history of the church.,1424044800,,396,4.025316455696203

At the end of that week, we pop these in as an overview of what we have just read and the kids love to hear it again and see it played out with fun characters. My kids love these so much that they watch them even when we aren't doing our study at that time. They have learned so much about the Bible from these by reinforcing what we have read or studied. Love these videos.",1423785600,,524,3.952830188679245

4690241,5,B005GD007O,"This is a fantastic DVD! I wanted something educational to teach my daughters about the Bible and, more specifically, the book of Genesis. This DVD is entertaining, funny, and educational. I appreciate that it does not take a position on the story of Creation with regards to when it happened and how long God took to create. Instead, it focuses on the most important themes of the Creation story: God created nature, the world, and human beings, that humans were created male and female and they were created in His image (i.e. they are relational, creative, and personal), and that humans were created to manage and care for the rest of His creation. While I DO hold an opinion on Creation (i.e. the debate between literal 7 days versus billions of years), I believe this debate often polarizes Christians. I want my daughters to learn that what is MOST important is that God is the author of life, and good Christian people can differ on some of the details. If that's your desire for your children, this is a great DVD. It even explains how different denominations have different opinions on some of the Old Testament books (Orthodox versus Catholic versus Protestant). I love this! We have Catholic friends and Orthodox friends and Evangelical friends - I want my kids to learn about Church history and those who love Jesus that have a different perspective than our family does.",1422576000,,1384,4.794979079497908
4690242,2,B005GD007O,"Nice idea, and maybe the later videos are better, but it was kind of slow moving and bounced randomly from one topic to another. Maybe with older kids it would be good.... but I feel like once you get to the age of kids who are able to be interested in any discussion of the Septuagint, then they are no longer going to want to watch cartoons and puppets talking about it. I was disappointed with it. My kids fell asleep during it, which they never do. My husband gave me a dirty look after he watched it. Overall, I recommend borrowing it before buying it to see if it works for you. We borrowed the second dvd but haven't brought ourselves to watch it yet. Bummer. The preview looked great. I applaud Vischer for seeing and implementing the importance of the Bible into programming for kids, but I think this one misses the mark a bit.",1422489600,4,837,4.337579617834395

4690285,3,B005GD007O,"My boys are ages 2.5 and 5; we got this movie hoping that it would have a lot of the same style of humor as VeggieTales, appealing to both adults and kids, while actually teaching Biblical stories (rather than just ""morality tales."") I know my kids are a bit younger, but they're both perfectly capable of following live-action programming, so I figured they would be able to follow live puppets just as easily as an animated show.

Well, I was wrong. Even I had trouble keeping track of all the characters who were introduced at once. The story took a very long time to ever even get to the Genesis narrative; instead it dragged on a prolonged question session, asking ""What is the Bible?"" which bounced from character to character so quickly that, by the time the story really picked up, both of my kids had decided to play outside instead. Neither my husband nor I were endeared enough to it to try to watch it through ourselves -- we made it about halfway through before turning it off.

I'm hoping that, just as the first few VeggieTales films were a little... unpolished, this series will also pick up. I plan to try out some of the other ones before making a call on the whole series, but as for this video, I think it's a bust for my kiddos.

EDIT: Well, we went back and finished the episode while my kids were out of the room. Thankfully, they didn't hear or see my shock at what I saw.

When asking the question of why sin entered the world, the film takes a decidedly anti-sovereignty position by claiming that sin exists because God loved people so much, and was so concerned with man's freedom, that He didn't have a choice in the matter -- He HAD to allow man to sin. And even though God really didn't want it to happen, man sinned anyway.

This is completely contrary to what the Bible says about God's control over everything that takes place and completely changes the narrative of the entire inspired Scriptures; now, instead of God governing all things and frustrating the will of nations, bringing everything under His rule... now, the God being presented really WANTS things to go one way, but is incapable of making that happen. Such a god doesn't get what He wants. And more importantly, such a god can offer children no comfort or assurety in His ability to protect them from all the will of the evil one, since His good will can be thwarted by created beings. A god who can be frustrated by the will and actions of His own creation is a God who can promise no peace; it turns His promises into merely an intention. Such a god offers no real promise of hope.

Given that... I don't think I'll be purchasing the other videos, at least not without some heavy pre-screening before I let my kids watch them. I can't tell them that on the one hand, God has everything under control and they can trust in Him, while on the other hand telling them that He has no control over evil and sin.",1414540800,2,2907,4.4344569288389515

4690288,5,B005GD007O,"I bought these for my kids, ages 7, 5, and 4. At first, I thought they were a little goofy and too far over their heads. But the kids all love them! Surprisingly, my 4yo loves them most. He will randomly burst out with something like, ""Joseph was Pharoah's right-hand man. He was second in command over all of Egypt!"" We bought the one about Acts, too, and right now my youngest is rambling on about how Paul told King Agrippa about ""this Jesus guy,"" and King Agrippa loved Paul. (Every once in a while my son will shout, ""I appeal to Caesar!!"") I like their explanations of the role of science (not anti-science at all), and I LOVE their big-picture view of ""God's Rescue Plan,"" starting in Genesis and continuing through all the videos. They really pull everything together, as far as the ongoing purpose of each section of the Bible. I usually play them while we're driving, and I've learned quite a bit, too! I only wish I'd had these when my older kids were a little younger, especially when I hear how much my youngest has absorbed. Highly recommended!",1410134400,9,1058,4.515625

4690290,5,B005GD007O,"This inventive, informative, and funny new series from VeggieTales creator Phil Vischer is valuable for anyone. In this, the first volume, I find a group of puppets explaining things like What is the Bible? Who wrote the Bible? Why do some Bibles have different numbers of books? What does the word Genesis mean? One high point is the song written and sung by The Bentley Brothers (actually friends since grade school, Rhett McLaughlin and Lincoln Neal). There are two episodes, about 25 minutes each, and some bonus features. Characters include a blue-haired Sunday School Lady, a cowboy, a pair of British brothers (Clive and Ian), a pirate, and Buck Denver, a news spokesman, among others. What Vischer did is to go through the entire Bible, book by book, giving an overview. With 66 books in the Old and New Testament, this is no mere kids show, it is a greatly needed, enjoyable but usable way to learn to understand Whats in the Bible better.",1409702400,,948,4.786585365853658

4690307,5,B005GD007O,"We got this as a gift from Grandma, and I was a little sceptical about it. I grew up with Veggie Tales, so I wasn't too sure about the puppets. This series is a lot deeper. They have very real discussions about different beliefs in christianity, how the bible was created, what about the Apocrypha, basic story structure, how old is the earth, etc. Phil took the brave approach and gives the Christian perspective and the sceptic/mainstream perspective on everything, even breaking down common differences amongst christians. This will be great for discussions when my daughter gets older.
That all said, my daughter is only two. She doesn't comprehend any of the actual teaching yet and this is still her favorite movie. The puppets are funny and there are a LOT of clever songs. Youtube sensations Rhett and Link show up to do songs and I suspect, a few voices. The songs are catchy and will be humming them at work all day. It is cool how it can really entertain toddlers, and when they get older there is enough sustenance that it should even entertain a 8-10 year old and help kickstart some serious conversations. They cover stuff, especially the apocrypha topic, that I didn't even hear about until my 300 level college theology classes. Granted, not as indepth and definitely aimed at younger minds, but it was still impressive to me that they'd even broach the subject. All in all, my wife and I are slowly collecting this entire series and it will be a common show playing in our household. And, much to my chagrin, my daughter doesn't like Veggietales!

4690320,5,B005GD007O,"I've been using this material with the ""'tween"" boys in our church since September & they & I both love it. Once you get the kids to realize there is so much depth to this material - they really pay attention to the entire presentation. My formula which I've been using is - we review the previous week for approximately 15 to 20 mins - watch once part of the two parts per DVD & then review the material which was just presented. Our lessons are 60 mins & the kids at times don't want to leave because they are so involved - they just loose track of time & want to know more & more about gods word & how it all fits together into their ever expanding lives. The material may seem simple - but its so layered with other parts of the bible that you can take the discussions which the kids develop & walk into depth of other parts of the bible - example - what may start with a discussion on Isaiah - may take you through parts of Acts - or historical discussions of everyday life as its shown in First & Second King's. Highly, highly recommended as a teaching resource - for many age levels - for both girls & boys. Side note from a teacher/ leaders perspective- the number one reason I love this material - the lesson unfolds for you as the leader - I just make notes on the whiteboard I have in the room & that's the material I use to develop the lesson post presentation. Once you have your notes - challenge the kids with questions on what they saw & thought & the let the beauty of the discussion work for you.

In closing - most excellent job done Buck !!!! :-)",1384041600,2,1566,4.134426229508197
4690321,1,B005GD007O,"I had hoped this DVD would be the ""ticket"" to reach our elementary children's attention and heart concerning the details of the Bible. So, trusting the source where I bought it, I turned it on prior to our youth club as a means of keeping our early arrivers captivated, yet learning. Day one went well. Then came day two, when I turned on Part 2 of the DVD. Though the Bible club children made no comment, our youth workers approached me after our club saying, ""Mrs..., did you know that DVD teaches the Big Bang Theory?""  Now, to be honest, knowing our helpers are fresh from being children themselves, I thought perhaps they had heard a portion that refuted false teachings like the Big Bang Theory. So, needing to take a closer look myself, I viewed the DVD at home.

Here's what I found:
It's much like the Muppets and Sesame St. with short exiting scenes and lots of lively puppets.
Part 1 was fine, though a bit deep for early grades, although presented in a lively manner in which their attention could be sustained.
Then I turned on Part 2, which taught on Genesis... and there it was.
A puppet quickly overviewed creation, starting with a ""BANG!"".... then he briefly described the components of creation w/ no mention of days.
So... I thought...maybe it's just a poor word choice. So I kept watching.
Then, the MC.. a human... repeated the creation account by saying, ""After the BANG.."" which he
followed up with an overview of the ""controversy"" of the meaning of ""day"".
He said, to some believe it's a literal day, others believe it's a reference to God's view of ""a day is as a thousand years"".
He then mentioned the component of the ""controversy"" - whether the world is 6000 yrs old or millions of years old,
to which he states, ""No one knows for sure."", while all along leaning heavily upon the possibility of the million year theory.

In my study of God's word, this is not Biblically accurate, and in fact, it plays into the hands of the evolutionary theory taught to children in schools across America. If you take a look at the deep research done by groups like Answers in Genesis, and Creation.com, you'll discover not only scientific research from reputable scientists, but also Biblical details of the study of God's words in it's original language. Here's an excerpt from creation.com:
""When Moses, under the inspiration of God, compiled the account of creation in Genesis 1, he used the Hebrew word ym for `day'. He combined ym with numbers (`first day', `second day', `third day', etc.) and with the words `evening and morning', and the first time he employed it he carefully defined the meaning of ym (used in this way) as being one night/day cycle (Genesis 1:5). Thereafter, throughout the Bible, ym used in this way always refers to a normal 24-hour day. 2,3 There is thus a prima facie case that, when God used the word ym in this way, He intended to convey that the days of creation were 24 hours long.""

9/26/13 Update
The creator of ""What's in the Bible"", Phil Vischer, offers his defense of the ""Big Bang"" theory on his website, which reinforces my decision to not watch this video series. This is most unfortunate because there is a lot of excellent teaching, but teaching this one mistruth is like the enemy saying, ""Did God really say?"". I stand on the simple truth of God's word - it started with, ""God said let there be light"", not a bang, and a day is a 24 hour period of time. And even more importantly, ""Jesus, the son of man, came to seek and to save that which was lost."" Luke 19:10

4690327,3,B005GD007O,"What's in the Bible is the newest idea from Phil Vischer, the creator of VeggieTales which aims to take children through the entire Bible with currently Volumes 1 - 9 starting at Genesis through Malachi and more coming soon.  With characters like Clive and Ian and the Sunday School Lady and others who interact with Phil Vischer it seems promising but for us it didn't continue that way.  Each DVD is $14.99 or you can purchase the whole 9 DVD set for $109.99.

Volume I has two 25 minute episodes that are titled ""What is the Bible?"" and ""Who Wrote the Bible?""  As I said this DVD started out as promising but as my children and I continued to watch we were just sort of lost as there was so much going on and the back and forth between Phil in real life and the puppets was somewhat over-stimulating.  My children are ages 10 1/2, 6 and almost 8 and all three were asking me to turn it off after the first episode, even I felt overwhelmed and a bit confused at all the activity going on and sadly, was glad to acquiesce to my children's requests to stop the DVD.

I will say I could see that children who are new to church or are unchurched or even those who are in school and used to this type of learning would enjoy it and get a lot out of it, however for my children who don't need a lot of hype and already know most of what was covered in the episode we watched, it became boring despite all the glam and music.  There is something to be said for it being used within a church setting, but even then I'm leery of having to use `fun' and `contemporary' ideas to keep children's attention especially when it comes to God's Word.  Overall, I think the idea is good but if it was less busy my family would definitely have enjoyed it more.

I felt so overstimulated with all the different characters, songs, discussions and arguments going all over the place.  It was hard to focus on the real information and storyline.  I went back on my own to finish the DVD and it didn't get better.
In fact, we watched this one around age 3 and that was our result, now at 4 it's the same.  Didn't get any better for me either, so I'm selling my other three DVDs new in the package and I hope someone comes out with some great DVDs for kids with the same intentions.",1353196800,8,818,4.300653594771242
4690341,5,B005GD007O,"I am very picky about videos that claim to teach the Bible, especially to children. I've seen many after 20 years of church youth and children's ministry. This is the best: funny, sharp, Biblical, solid. Our grandchildren of all ages watch them over and over. The current series covers the entire Old Testament, including tough challenges  such as Leviticus and the prophets. The delightful assortment of ""teachers"" take on many controversial subjects, careful to avoid pushing a particular interpretation or denominational view, but also firmly supporting the historicity and accuracy of Scripture. They explain a lot of church doctrine and history, i.e., the meaning of ""canon"" and why believers can disagree about some interpretations of events. I'm amazed that the children prefer this series to almost everything else. They laugh, giggle, sing (the music is good, too) and repeat memorized lines from the DVDs. I'm getting as many gift sets as I can afford. The series is great for adults, too. I've been learning and laughing right along with the children. How many 6 and 8 year olds can happily talk about the Pentateuch? Mine can after watching these wonderful programs.",1351123200,22,1178,5.167539267015707

4690344,2,B005GD007O,"I purchased this dvd for $5 shipped and thought it would be a great deal, but I was wrong.  I admire the creator Phil Vischer and thought the content would be really sound.  The content was fine, but the delivery was not geared towards young children.  Having witty puppets intermingled with explanations about the Septuagint is not going to keep the attention of the average child.  My five-year-old and three-year-old were quickly lost and never regained much interest.  I gave it two stars because I learned some things, but I'm guessing that I'm not their target audience.",1330041600,8,576,4.896907216494846
8471463,2,B005GD007O,"I wanted to like this because it had some of the information needed for an overview of the Bible Sunday school curriculum we are teaching at our church. But it is really hurting on the diversity front (at least in episode 1, which is all the farther I needed to go): all but one of the characters is white (no, blue people don't count as people of color). All but one is male. Yes, it matters. Not a great representation of people for our varied children.",1522886400,,455,4.3023255813953485

8471468,5,B005GD007O,"Our kids love these videos. We haven't found a series anywhere that goes this in depth into biblical knowledge. A great alternative to the Veggie Tales franchise that was lost to Hollywood. Not just entertaining, but educational!",1516060800,,229,5.216216216216216
8471469,5,B005GD007O,"I absolutely love this show! So far from what I have seen, it's extremely biblically sound. Only rarely do they say anything I'm not sure I agree with. It's informative- I feel like I have learned from it as well, it's exciting and fun, the music is catchy and the characters relatable and adorable. I love that they aren't afraid to confront big questions and give honest, yet age appropriate answers. They tell the truth and leave you feeling uplifted and excited to know more about God and ready to get into His Word. Hands down the best kids show I have ever seen.",1515283200,,568,4.471153846153846

But it's original, entertaining, and I appreciate the goal of this series.",1508371200,,246,4.744186046511628
