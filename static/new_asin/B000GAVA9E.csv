8130150,2,B000GAVA9E,"I love both of these movies,but they are very bad prints of the original films.""Pride Of Jesse Hallum"" is decent I guess...being that it's an old CBS made for TV movie from 1981. But the main reason I bought this,was for ""Door To Door Maniac""(aka ""Five Minutes To Live"") The sound is awful,the picture is all scratchy....and worst of all,Johnny Cash's theme song for the film,""Five Minutes To Live"" was taken out. Probally because of copyrite laws or something,I'm not sure. I only payed a buck for this at Wal-Mart,so I guess I got what I payed for. This dvd is manufactered by Digi-View Entertainment. A company that makes terrible transfer copies of b-movies. If you are looking to purchase the REAL version of ""Door To Door Maniac""(aka ""Five Minutes To Live""),than I highly recommend that you buy the remastered original print version instead of this cheap copy. It may be more than a buck...but it's very well worth it. I'm gonna buy that one. Although I'll still keep this DVD,but only for ""Pride Of Jessie Hellum"".",1349222400,,1021,4.7740112994350286
