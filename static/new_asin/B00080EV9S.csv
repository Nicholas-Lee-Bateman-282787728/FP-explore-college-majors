8054978,3,B00080EV9S,More standard fair horror than most j-horror movies. Still it is two for one that are loosely connected. I prefer the second story a bit more. The female leads are known for J-horror and the male leads are two members of a band. Yeah that means they get to do their band thing in the movie and you have to live with a bit of stereotypical j-pop.,1461369600,,345,4.164179104477612
8054979,3,B00080EV9S,"This is a 2 part story about Japanese wraith. In the first film our wraith is akin to a succubus in the form of a school girl. After she kills enough people, we move on to part 2 of the film which opens with some irony as a family leaves a house they believe is cursed only to move into an apartment with a wraith. The daughter goes to the same school as in the first feature and meets people from it.

The film lacks a heavy scare factor. Most killing is off screen with minimum blood, except for maybe that one scene. Much of the film you see coming, but watch anyway in case they change something. The film also looks like something Stephen King would use in ""1408.""

The film uses the Dusty Springfield song ""I Only Want To Be With You"" which apparently doesn't translate into Japanese as their lyrics were not recognizable, although the film connection is apparent.

8054980,3,B00080EV9S,"""Shadow of the Wraith"" (Japanese title ""Ikisudama,"" or ""Living Ghost"") is an entry in the popular gakko no kaidan (ghosts at school) genre, aimed squarely at high school aged kids and younger.  These kinds of low-budget spook fests are pretty typical in Japan, and get cranked out during the summer when kids are eager for a scary story.  The director, Ikeda Toshiharu, is most famous for his film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Dead-Trap/dp/6305789649/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Dead Trap</a>&nbsp;although he has been cranking out this kind of low-budget work in recent years.

""Shadow of the Wraith"" has the extra hook of staring two pop-star brothers, Koji and Yuichi Matsuo from the band ""Doggy Bag,"" and two ""Teen Scream Queen"" sisters, Hitomi and Asumi Miwa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uzumaki/dp/B0002C9DJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uzumaki</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ju-On-The-Curse/dp/B0006B7KM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ju-On: The Curse</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eko-Eko-Azarak/dp/B000BB18O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eko Eko Azarak</a>) who are familiar faces to any fan of modern Japanese horror.  Think of ""Shadow of the Wraith"" as the Jonas Brothers appearing on an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goosebumps/dp/B005CM1II4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goosebumps</a>.

""Shadow of the Wraith"" is split into two stories, each staring one Matsuo brother and one Miwa sister.  The stories are very loosely linked by the brothers, who play brothers in a band.

The first story,"" Shadow of the Wraith,"" is a typical story of jealousy.  Popular boy loves popular girl.  Strange girl in the corner is jealous and projects psychic doppelganger to clear a bloody path to popular boy's affections.  You know the story.  Or maybe you don't.  ""Shadow of the Wraith"" is about a creature from Japanese folklore, called an Ikiryo, or ""living ghost.""  The mythology is very old, dating back to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tale-of-Genji/dp/0394735307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tale of Genji</a>, and I have never seen an ikiryo story on film before.  So that was kind of cool.  Unfortunately, novelty is all the story really had going for it, and ""Shadow of the Wraith"" is otherwise by-the-numbers.""

The next story, ""The  Hollow Stone"" starts off pretty good as a classic haunted apartment scenario.  A new girl moves into down, and finds out that she is living in a cursed apartment.  A charming neighbor, still reeling from the death of his brother, falls for the new girl and tries to help her survive where others have died.  I am a sucker for a good haunted apartment story, and I would have enjoyed ""The Hollow Stone"" quite a bit if it weren't for some unfortunately bad special effects.  The director forgot that less is more where ghosts are concerned, and shook some fake props at us that look like they could have been bought at the local Halloween store.  The ending to ""The Hollow Stone"" was also terrible.  It made no sense, and completely broke the rules of Japanese ghosts for no particular reason.

""Shadow of the Wraith"" is not a bad DVD.  The stories neither rise above nor sink below the level of the genre.  They are exactly the kind of show you would see in Japan flicking the tv channels in the summer. It's too bad that director Ikeda didn't try a little harder to bring some life into these stories, as they had some potential, but everyone involved seemed to be pretty content to produce something mediocre.",1319587200,,3738,6.018903591682419
8054981,1,B00080EV9S,"Ikisudama is a pair of supernatural thrillers told in two seperate parts...go figure ay? Part One takes place in one of the many fine Japanese schools that Asian horror fans have come to recognize, and by now, may be able to recognize on sight. It begins as Ryoji and Mariko, a pair of high school 'lovers' get to know each other in a vacant gymnasium. When, during class, another student, Asaji, mistakes an act of kindness from Ryoji as as some sort of declaration of love and begins to follow/stalk Ryoji around school. Asaji's behavior quickly extends beyond the walls of their school. Ryoji becomes suspicious of Asaji's intentions and it doesn't take very much longer for Mariko (Ryoji's girlfriend) to join that club. But as they say, two's company and three's a crowd, but Asaji is not the type to take a hint.

The second story is a loose continuation of the first story involving Ryoji's brother and band-mate Kazuhiko, who moves into their older sister and husband's apartment. Someone else is also moving into Kazuhiko's building; a young girl named Naoko. They briefly meet outside the building as he is in the courtyard taking photos. She and Kazuhiko find themselves in the same school and the same class where she tells her class the story of her old neighborhood where a curse had consumed family after family on her street, and Kazuhiko warns her that there are similar event taking place in apartments that share the number 5. Naoko has moved into Apartment 505.

***

Shadow of the Wraith does happen in two loosely connected parts with two seperate titles; Part One: Shadow of the Wraith, and Part Two: The Hollow Stone. The director obviously favored a two-part system rather than integrating the stories into a single story. Why? Only he may know. The stories might've been more compelling as one. There's seemingly little or no time issues to prevent this other than they needed a separate story for the other ""star"". The juxtaposition of the two story-lines would have most assuredly held my interest better.

Ikisudama plays like the candy-coated thrillers of yesterday such as Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and so many other tame MTV-style suspense films. Style over substance. With a partial reprieve for The Hollow Stone 'episode', as it was the more actualized and convincing of the two. Part One plays more like a Twilight Zone episode, but not a classic Rod Serling episode; more like one of the new Forest Whittaker hosted, remade, regurgitated episodes with today's ""stars"". Or more precisely, like Fatal Attraction. I think I rolled my eyes so many times that it must've looked as if I just hopped off of The Riddler's Revenge at Six Flags! Low budget special effects, manufactured and transparent suspense aside, the final nail in the coffin for Part 1 was the cheesy pop song that robbed the music from 'I Only Want To Be With You' as we get a look at the JPop any-band Marshall Law, which in real life is an actual brother-brother duo known as Doggy Bag. Who by the way, get top billing in the end credits and individual, widely spaced mentions. Something their agent(s) probably insisted on.

This movie was clearly a vehicle for the duo. There's very little positive about Ikisudama other than one short, tense scene in Part One and the premise in Part Two is interesting but not fulfilling. Horror fans will want to see it just to see it, but they shouldn't expect anything new or exciting. Or maybe just pass on it all together.",1147392000,2,3480,4.7645107794361525
8054982,5,B00080EV9S,"It was my extreme luck to stumble upon this charming work of sticky horror only the other day.  Although Japan is well known for it's clever, sometimes gut-wrenching horror, Toshiharu Ikeda stands out above the status quo, especially in his latest skein of scares, ""Shadow of the Wraith"".

This movie is made special in that it cleverly appeals to a young adult audience, yet it avoids using gore to do it (utilizing only three blood scenes throughout the entirety of the film).  Rather, the younger crowd is attracted by the two male leads who (aside from being aesthetically pleasing) are also members of a famous pop duo from japan.  However, for those unfamiliar with Doggy Bag, Ikeda has another draw for die-hard psychological horror fans.

Ikeda cleverly draws on inherent fears and discomforts that plague all genders from childhood into their adult years throughout the film's two parts.  In the first, he cruelly preys upon the adolescent insecurities surrounding relationships and the failures that may or may not be associated with them.  In the second part, Ikeda illustrates the childhood fear of dark, unknown spaces (closets), especially when they are found in a new home.

Overall, Ikeda cleverly frightens audiences by creating stories based on his viewers' deepest childhood fears and the perpetuating insecurities of adolescence.

This film is recommended for horror fans over the age of 16 due to violence in part one and themes of terror.",1120003200,4,1460,5.100840336134453
