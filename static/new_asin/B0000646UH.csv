1705032,5,B0000646UH,"This documentary is very well done.  It was especially interesting to me since I was Dr. Heinz Schlicke's secretary for one year in 1965.  I had heard that he had been captured off a German U-boat.  He was a real character and brilliant, I'm sure.  A couple years ago I ran across this documentary on the History Channel and was so surprised to hear his name and see his interview.  I missed most of the program.  Recently I checked on Amazon and there was the DVD.  Excellent footage of the huge German submarine and very educational.",1235174400,20,535,4.510416666666667
1705033,4,B0000646UH,"This is an excellent recreation of the historical WW2 voyage of Germany's U-Boat (U-234). The recreation comes from actual footage from U.S. & German newsreels, photographs, and present day interviews with some of the involved U-Boat crew, Allied force members, members involved with the Manhattan project, German & Japanese survivors/family members.

This U-Boat was not sent on voyage to Japan to participate in battle but as a last ditch effort by Germany to join in the technological forces with Japan by transporting a secret cargo (1200 lbs. of Uranium and a complete ME262 jet fighter) needed by the Japanese to aid their atomic bomb program. Also of interest the film demonstrates the relationship between the Germans & Japanese. On board U-234 were 2 high ranking Japanese officers(armament experts) who had trained with the German's for over a year. They were eager to return to Japan to share all they had learned about atomic bombs & the ingredients necessary to do the job.

After the fall of Hitler and the war with Germany ends, U-234 is required to surrender. The U-Boat captain secretly avoids surrender to the Canadian forces. Knowing the humiliation they would face if captured the Japanese officers committed suicide (the Samurai way) before the U-Boat surrendered to the American forces off of the Atlantic coast of the U.S. thus becoming Germany's last U-Boat to surrender.

Once on American soil, the crew is questioned about the cargo and in an interesting twist, the Manhattan Project becomes the recipient of the Uranium needed to develop the atomic bombs that were later dropped on Hiroshima & Nagasaki ending the war with Japan.

Having met & viewed this film with one of the interviewed crew survivors I think this is an amazing story shown from all sides that has been brought to light.",1231804800,12,1816,5.023255813953488

7960409,5,B0000646UH,"I had not heard about this particular U boat or its fascinating story.  It carried two Japanese soldiers who trained in Germany to teach the Nazi weapon systems to their fellow japanese at the tail end of the war in march of 1945.  On board this U boat was a dismantled V 2 rocket, and ME 262 jet fighter-bomber, and plans for other weapons, and research for German's atomic bomb project, and a cargo of uranium 235 needed to build an atomic bomb.  Japan did not have any uranium so it could not build a bomb even if it knew how.
 Highly entertaining and informative.  We should all be glad the U boat did not reach the Japanese.

First, let me say that I'm intrigued by anything to do with submarines...from any point in time.  I'm especially fascinated by wreck discoveries, circumstances, wreckage dives, videos/photos and explanations of what did them and their crew in.  This is one such story...with a lot of detail, great video imagery, animation and graphics, mystery and intrique.
 Wistfully sad and tragic....a tribute to the U-Boat fleet, U-234 crew, one particular U-234 crewmember and all submariners in general.  Now add a bunch of committed (if not reckless) modern day divers pushing the scuba depth limits beyond the max in attempts to survey, enter and identify this particular WWII U-boat...a ten year or so long quest that ultimately achieves the team's almost obsessive objectives/mission, but still ends up leaving a big unanswered questions at the story's end. Namely, what was this particular Nazi U-boat doing here off the Northeastern US Atlantic seaboard when it was commanded to change routing/destination mid patrol and long assumed to be lost in the Med off of Gibratar?  Oh...and in the process these guys lose 3 divers on two separate occassions??  Really?  They were pretty matter of fact about this and almost aloof...though I'm sure all were VERY deeply affected.  Begs the question, though, of -- ""was it really worth it?""  Thus, enter the subtle (albeit, unstated) theme of man's insatiable and incurable thirst to solve mysteries...any mystery will do....some more than others...to risk such life and limb below the surface depths (and beyond the limits of sane recreational scuba diving).  But this was a great story and DVD...regardless!  Naration was excellent, video (above and below depths) was superb, the divers BRAVE and Courageous and COMMITTED....and the U-234's back story and historical signficance, context and human-face side clipets very well done and nicely interwoven in and around the diving story and identification efforts.  The story was tight, well presented, seamless and riveting.  In particular, I liked how they visited the German U-Boat Museum and interviewed the curator/U-boat expert and former crewmember himself...on two separate trips.  If you're into submarines; Uboats; WWII dive wrecks; learning more bout the HUMAN side of the very brave (and ultimately doomed) U-boaters back then and divers today  risking/adventureous activities; 'cold' mystery ('who done it' type) intrique and some really GOOD video and story telling....get this and enjoy!  I don't think it will disappoint you.  BTW...from the wreckage and big hull breach around the separated conning tower, I think it was rammed by a surface ship (deliberately or not).  I don't buy the 'wild runaway/circle back torpedo' story...but what do I know? :-)",1388361600,2,2999,5.347547974413646

7960418,5,B0000646UH,"I saw this video on the History Channel and HAD to get it for myself!  Who knew that Japan almost got uranium for its own atom bomb near the end of the war, and who knew that it was its ally, Nazi Germany, who was willing to provide it?  Who knew that the United States' defeat of Germany caused the uranium to be surrendered at the end of the war in Europe, and that it was actually en route to Japan in a German U-boat at the time?  Who knew that the uranium we used in our own bombs was probably the same uranium that was surrendered by the German U-boat commander?  This is one war tale the history books don't cover, folks, but it happened.  The producers of this film make a very strong and convincing argument on this very obscure subject; I highly recommend it.",1325980800,2,769,4.204081632653061
