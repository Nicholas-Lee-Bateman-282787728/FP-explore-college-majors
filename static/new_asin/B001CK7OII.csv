3514006,5,B001CK7OII,"Very entertaining and uplifting story of a young girl's effort to become a star in an acrobatic performance group.  The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting superb, the story well-written and inspirational.  Highly recommennded for everyone, but especially for families with girls ten and older.  I suggest you get the two season box set, or the first season's package and then the second season set, since they follow in a logical sequence (and you'll want to view all 52 episodes, they're that good).",1233360000,,506,5.146341463414634
3514007,5,B001CK7OII,"I did not actually purchase this  boxed set of Season 1 and 2, because I purchased each individual DVD of the series as they originally became available in the US. This boxed set is a deal and then some for the price and the product! There is a total of 10 discs (I believe, possibly 12) in the series, so imagine speding anywhere from $10-20 per disc as opposed to just $50 or $60 for two whole seasons.
  Anyway, besides the great price, this series is about a girl named Sora who joins a circus/acrobatic show. It has drama, comedy, love, tragedy, sports, and really superb art. There is only one little cute animal sidekick, a seal, who gets into the act too!
  I really enjoy this series. I would recommend it for anyone who likes sporting anime, or anyone who likes anime period.",1231372800,,785,4.423611111111111
8288074,5,B001CK7OII,"This series is a wonderful heart warming story of finding your way with hard work and perseverance. I loved it the first moment I saw it with the acrobatic displays of wonder and intrigue, in a world of the circus setting. Kaleido Star is a must see for any anime fan. The boxset itself has seasons 1 & 2, and it was a fantastic price. The item shipped fast and was delivered to my residence earlier than anticipated. Awesome series, awesome seller! Thank you!",1395532800,,460,4.488095238095238
8288075,5,B001CK7OII,"this is a fun lovely beautiful girly anime according to my guy friends <(>..^)>. Very touching and adorably awesome mixed with a little drama at times . Relaxing anime a good break away from the action filled anime . Great price deal, arrives fast.",1388793600,,248,4.659090909090909
8288076,5,B001CK7OII,The seller answered all questions swiftly and the product came just as described! The Kaleido Star two season collection came factory sealed and looks just like the picture.  Not only are they great with customer service they also got it here in less than a week even though amazon estimated it could be two.,1387065600,,308,4.703703703703703
8288077,5,B001CK7OII,"This series is amazing and its bundle with season 1 and 2 , great collection . Season 1 ofcourse is by far better than season but 2 season 2 is still very good . Sora is a great character and her attitude is very uplifting . If you ever feel like you cant just watch Kaleido Star and get Soras catchy can do attitude . Its a great series .",1381708800,,339,3.857142857142857
8288078,5,B001CK7OII,I haven't watched the whole thing but if you wanna see something inspiring and cute than here you go.  I wouldn't suggest watching this with a guy because they will get bored.. total chick flick =P,1343260800,,197,4.472222222222222
8288079,5,B001CK7OII,"This review will focus on the DVD packaging and releases, not so much on the actual anime. Other reviewers have already talked about Kaleido Star as an anime at length, so to save on space I won't be talking about that here.

- BACKSTORY -

I don't own this box set but I do own<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-Amazing-Collection/dp/B000B5IONO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star - Amazing Collection</a>and the<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-New-Wings-True-Star-Collection/dp/B000T4T8ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star: New Wings True Star Collection</a>which is equivalent to this Complete Collection Box Set. I got a huge headache trying to figure out what features were available in which releases, so I'm writing this review to hopefully save someone out there the same pain I went through.

- ABOUT THE OVAS AND EXTRAS -

In this box set you get all 51 episodes of the anime + ""The Amazing Princess Without a Smile"" OVA. Problem is, there are two OVAs for this anime, and buying this box set means you don't get the Layla-centric OVA, ""Legend of Phoenix ~Layla Hamilton Monogatari~"". You also don't get any of the extras included in the individual DVD releases - like interviews with Director Junichi Sato, commentaries with Mike MacRae (Leon) and Illich Guardiola (Yuri), etc. If you want all 51 episodes + both OVAs, you'll want to look into the Funimation releases I've linked at the bottom.

- OTHER NOTES -

A couple of my anime box sets (like this one) come from ADV Films - a now defunct company who's anime assets were taken up by Funimation. In August, Funimation will be releasing the first season in their popular S.A.V.E. format with season 2 coming in October. I've never bought a S.A.V.E. edition of anything, so I can't talk about the packaging for those, but it seems like they're bare bones when it comes to content (i.e. little to no extras). For some people that's fine, but there are those out there that want all the extras and as far as I can tell you only get that with the individual ADV Films DVD releases.

Below I'll list the options you have for owning the Kaleido Star Anime:

Since the S.A.V.E. editions haven't been released yet, I won't try to guess what kind of features they may or may not have.",1343174400,8,5421,6.846153846153846
8288080,5,B001CK7OII,"Kaleido Star begins with a sixteen-year-old girl named Sora Naegino who comes to America and tries to audition for her dream job in life - to work as a star at the Kaleido Stage, a fascinating and amazing circus. The entire two seasons deal with her trials and struggles that try to ensnare her success. Its definitely worth watching for all ages and it teaches life lessons of determination and perseverance.

Many of the characters have a lot of development - they all have their secrets and all are willing to do anything to gain their final triumphs. A lot of competition and desperation to acquire being at the top of the spectrum and still keep the audiences coming back. Lots of humor and laughs, and many of the acts they perform are imaginative and creative - I do wish though, that there would have been more stage scenes. The anime is beautifully drawn and the good music to boot is brilliant as well. It will keep you begging for more.

If you're watching the English dubbed version, many people may try to warn you how annoying the voices are. I agree Sora's can be a little aggravating at first - but I personally think it gets cute as the anime continues. Thumbs up to both Yuri's and Leon's voices - they add a lot of depth and mystery to their characters.

So all in all, I recommend this series to anyone who is interested in circuses, trapeze acts and the like, or anybody who just wants a suspenseful and exciting thriller to watch.",1302048000,,1452,4.492424242424242
8288081,5,B001CK7OII,"For anybody who saw The Nutcracker as a child and wanted to become a ballerina...

If you've seen the series then you understand my title--I LOVE THIS ANIME!!! The animation is cute without being overly moe, and it's a storyline I can appreciate from beginning to end (I first saw this when I was a teenager, and even now at the age of 27 I still love it). Since I first watched it dubbed, I find it hard to switch to subs and Japanese audio, but the option is available if you want it. This is the complete series (52 episodes), including a special ""extra stage"" episode that leaves you wondering about the history of one particular character... I occasionally got irritated with some of the characters, but overall, a great buy for anyone who's into feel-good anime with characters who fight to overcome any trial in order to make their dreams a reality.",1299542400,3,856,4.558441558441558
8288082,5,B001CK7OII,I'm just happy to own a series that I love in one package. The only thing that I can think to complain about is that it doesn't include the OVA's.,1296864000,,146,3.9
