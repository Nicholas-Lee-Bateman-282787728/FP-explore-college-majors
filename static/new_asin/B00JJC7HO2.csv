6361286,4,B00JJC7HO2,"""Making a door mat of yourself will never get you anywhere,"" socialite Consuelo Croyden (Norma Shearer) chides her ardent admirer Terry Trindale, but she may as well have been referring to herself. Consuelo quickly reveals a weakness for her heel of an ex-fiance (George Sanders). She has a habit of reconciliating with him even though he's historically and repeatedly done her wrong. This evening he's come crawling back again, confident that she can't resist him. Except that Consuelo has an ace in the hole.

Distracted songwriter Terry Trindale (Robert Taylor) has his head in the clouds. His songwriting partner ""Chappy"" Champagne (Frank McHugh) tries to shake him off his inertia, but it's no use. Terry is smitten hard with Consuelo and nothing else registers. And when he ends up owing her $3200 from a casino game of bunco, to collect on the debt, Consuelo employs him to pose as her lover for ten weeks. Her mandate is that he keep her away from her persuasive ex-fiance, by hook or by crook.

1942's HER CARDBOARD LOVER adapts the stage play and is a farcical romantic comedy from the MGM studio. It turned out to be Norma Shearer's final film. Then 42 years old, Shearer realized that the plum parts weren't hers to land anymore. It didn't help her career that she'd opted to reject offered roles in NOW, VOYAGER and MRS. MINIVER. HER CARDBOARD LOVER received a lukewarm reception from the critics and the moviegoing audiences, perhaps because there was in that period a prevailing preference for patriotic dramas - and that played a factor in her retirement, as well.

With a war in the works there were other things on Robert Taylor's mind. Not that you could tell it from his onscreen shenanigans. After their more somber pairing in ESCAPE (1940), he and Norma Shearer get a chance to gleefully ham it up. Conversely, George Sanders sleepwalks thru his bits. Somewhere in between was perhaps a middle-ground that was ignored in favor of presenting a ditzy tone. Still, I giggled when Taylor walked into the room wearing Shearer's shiny pajamas. And I giggled during the basement fracas in which bitter rivals Taylor and Sanders (or his double, anyway) went at it with mops and a bucket and a trashcan lid. And if those aren't enough of a decider, Robert Taylor also sings a verse or two of ""I Dare You."" You know how rare that is.",1404604800,4,2345,4.770935960591133
6361287,4,B00JJC7HO2,"This is a high quality ""A Class"" production with George Cukor directing and George  Saunders, Chill Wills, Frank McHugh and Elizabeth Patterson providing excellent support for MGM superstars Robert Taylor {Terry Trindale}and Norma Shearer {Consuelo Croyden}. Ah !! if only the screen play hadn't been less than average with some turgid dialogue and contrived plotting - then this might have been a late classic ""screwball comedy"" in the 1930's mode.

Despite the lackluster scenario, this is a fun film and Tayor and Shearer give ""star quality"" performances and the premise of Consuelo hiring Trindale as a bodyguard {to pay off a gambling debt} to keep George Saunders {Tony Barling} a playboy with a ""roving eye"" whom she loves but does not want to marry away from her - which is an odd but interesting twist !! Robert Taylor's performance is particlarly good - he appears to be enjoying playing a comedic role for a change.

There are some good scenes in the film - in partiucular a well directed telephone scene exquisitely played by Shearer, a well played and funny ""knock-em out drag em out"" fight between Saunders and Taylor and in one of the many variations of running in and out of various bedrooom by all parties - Taylor wearing a negligee belonging to Shearer that for the audience of 1942 could only have one meaning  - they were now ""one"" !!

In the screwball comedy tradition there are numerous mis-understandings, a lot of running in and out of bedrooms, characters arrested for the wrong reasons and Chill Wills as a judge trying to make ""heads and tails"" of these shennanigans by being both wise and exasperated !!

This was Ms. Shearer's last film and its a good if not spectacular send off for one of the biggest female stars of the 1920's and 30's. She retired in 1942 and had a very successfull second marriage. In 1942 she turned down the role of ""'Mrs Miniver"" [1942} which won 7 Oscars including a best actress award for Greer Garson and instead opted to star in ""Her Cardboard Lover"".  As a career move this was a huge error as she would have been perfect in the role and was very popular with British film audiences BUT she didn't want to play a mother of a grown son - what a mistake !!!

Despite the some what contrived screenplay, the stars and supporting cast make this film well worth viewing and I give it a 4 star rating.",1404000000,7,2355,4.630695443645084
6361288,5,B00JJC7HO2,"I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time and ordered it right away. I was very curious to find out what it was like, because I had read it didn't do well at all when it was released in 1942. I thought it was really good! It has lots of funny lines and scenes. I think maybe the reason it didn't do well in 1942 was because that was the same year Mrs. Miniver was released and it was a huge hit. The dramatic story of Mrs. Miniver and the war perhaps made this film seem just like a piece of silly fluff to be disregarded.

In some ways, this film kind of reminds me of Private Lives, which Norma made in 1931. Some of the comedy just made me think of that film. Norma looks great in this film. In the movie she made right before this one, We Were Dancing, her hairstyle is just all wrong for her. But, in this film she's back to looking like Norma.

I think this is a fun comedy along the lines of a screwball comedy. As with those types of comedies, you're supposed to just sit back and have fun; they're not meant to be practical or reasonable. Robert Taylor is hilarious and I laughed so hard in the scene where he comes out dressed in Norma's pajamas!

If you're a fan of screwball comedies, I think you'll like this. But, if you don't like those types of comedies, then you probably won't.

It comes with a theatrical trailer. The film quality and sound are great.",1397174400,15,1380,4.138059701492537
8651238,4,B00JJC7HO2,"Not your normal love story. Norma Shearer over-dramatic from the silent film days was actually perfect in her role, which called for that
over-dramatic character of the part she was cast. Robert Taylor enjoyable as well as the other male supporting actor, also perfectly cast. Silly movie but whom of us hasn't known someone like her at even a modern-day level and the subject of the film itself was deeper due to that than apparent on the surface. Not wanting to give the plot away, although the other reviews might have done so already.",1520726400,,538,4.73404255319149

8651240,5,B00JJC7HO2,"Clear, clean image quality, good, clear audio quality. Well manufactured copy of this movie. Very funny characters played by Robert Taylor & George Sanders. Not AT ALL like other parts that they have played,(except the George Sanders is still the ""cad"" as in many of the movies that he is in) Very exaggerated facial expressions and physical comedy by these guys. Probably the most remarkable aspect about this movie. The gowns... the gowns... the gowns.. - as usual, the wardrobe for Norma Shearer by Kalloch is, at the least, a singular justification for seeing, owning this movie if you enjoy fashion design.",1506038400,,611,5.0

8651245,4,B00JJC7HO2,"I liked it and agree with with another review that it probably would have fit in more with the films of the 30's and being released after Pearl Harbor when audiences had changed, really killed it.  Robert Taylor was right at the time, it shouldn't have been filmed at all, moods had changed!  But it's a fun film.",1429574400,,313,4.379310344827586
8651246,3,B00JJC7HO2,"That movie was Norma Shearer's last film and so I wanted it.  Not what I expected and understand why the movie flopped at the time and why she made a wrong decision deciding to do it instead of Mrs. Miniver which was a hit and a million seller for Greer Garson, but I did not totally dislike it either, entertaining it is and you can see the acting between Robert Taylor and Miss Shearer at its best. Overall is Ok and I am glad I purchased it.",1422921600,2,444,4.103448275862069
