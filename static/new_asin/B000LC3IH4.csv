2705391,5,B000LC3IH4,I've been waiting for something like this for years. I'm a fan of the 80's basketball (and the Lakers). I think it's a very good idea releasing all this kind of stuff. Personally I have pre-order this item und I hope you will be relesesing packs like this. (I can't wait to have it at home),1170633600,9,290,4.196428571428571
2705392,5,B000LC3IH4,"I will buy this set when it is released as I have bought just about every other NBA DVD set released with complete games. I am a huge fan of 80s and early 90's NBA. I've noticed that the have started releasing entire playoff series on DVD, this is a great idea...let me give you a list of the Classic series you should release next...

1) 1984 NBA Finals Celtics vs Lakers (better then the 85 finals)

2) 1981 ECF 76ers vs Celtics

3) 1981 NBA Finals Celtics vs Rockets

4) 1986 NBA Finals Celtics vs Rockets

5) 1987 NBA Finals Celtics vs Lakers

6) 1987 ECF Pistons vs Celtics

7) 1984 ECF Celtics vs Knicks

8) 1991 EC Round 1 Pacers vs Celtics

9) 1988 EC Semis Hawks vs Celtics

10) Do a boxed set which includes about 10 or 12 great regular season games of Larry Bird's career. Pick about 5 or 6 of his classic buzzer beater games and then pick 5 or 6 of his great performances. Focus only on regular season games and don't include anything that has already been released on DVD.

Now that I have gotten my Celtics/ Larry Bird biased picks out of the way, let me offer some other ideas as well...

1) 1980 NBA Finals Lakers vs 76ers

2) 1998 ECF Pacers vs Bulls

3) 1993 NBA Finals Suns vs Bulls

4) Any Bulls/Knicks series during the 90s (as long as Jordan is playing)

5) All All-Star games, dunk contests and 3 point contests from the 80s

6) All All-Star games, dunk contests and 3 point contests from the 90s

7) 1977 NBA Finals Blazers vs 76ers

8) Any Bulls/Pistons series from 80s or 90s not one already released)

9) Do a Pistol Pete box set (include 4 or 5 complete games)

10) All 92 Dream Team Games (Tourney of Americas and Barcelona Olympics)

This is classic basketball that fans will eat up. Just do it right. Don't edit the games, don't cut out an minuyte or two here (because we do notice when you do).

YEAR ENDER SYNOPSIS It was the rematch of the decade, and a rivalry for the ages. By 1985 the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers had established themselves as the NBA's finest. Now for a second straight season, these perennial powerhouses were set to do battle once again for the NBA Championship. Determined to avenge their heartbreaking NBA Finals loss to Boston just one year earlier, the Lakers refused to be denied in this ultimate clash of the titans. - 7",1166400000,21,1574,4.5836298932384345

2705428,2,B000LC3IH4,"Unforgiveable!!!
The first half of game 1 is almost entirely omitted!

No big deal you say.
There are 11 additional halves of championship basketball
to be viewed you say.
It is only the first half of the first game you say.

The first half of game 1 of the 1985 NBA Championship
is one of greatest and record-breaking exhibitions
of championship play by one of the greatest
(if not the greatest) NBA teams ever,
the 1985 Boston Celtics.
The Celtics broke the record for points scored
in a half and for the largest half-time lead
in NBA Championship history in the first half
of game 1.
They made the Lakers, another great team,
who ultimately won the series,
appear completely impotent.
An unbelievably great achievement.

I purchased this DVD set as a Celtics fan
and am very disappointed at this omission.
Moreso because there seems no reason for it.
It is available.
I've watched it on YouTube.com.

Why would the producers of the video do this?
Does anyone know?

I am still glad that I have this set,

2705429,5,B000LC3IH4,"I was ending my sophomore year of high school and still stinging from last years Championship series, which the Celtics won in 7 hard fought games---emphasis on ""fought""!  This rematch was long-awaited and my friends and I rejoiced as the Lakers finally beat the Celtics for the NBA Championship [as it was called back then].  This was a historic series and being able to relive them in this set, which includes all 6 games, was a great trip down Memory Lane.  Much of the first half of Game 1 isn't available and it is stated on the DVD.  A special treat for me was hearing the iconic timber of Chick Hearn announcing a portion of the action in Game 2---I actually cried hearing him call the action in that way only he could.  This was the series that propelled the NBA into stratospheric heights as future Hall-Of-Famers on both sides battled it out in pro basketball's most polarizing rivalry.  You will see the brilliance of Magic and Bird at their height, along with the dawning of Worthy and McHale as forces to be reckoned with.  Kareem showed why the conversation should begin and end with Greatest Of All Time.  I personally couldn't stand the color commentary of Tom Heinsohn, the worse ever, but that's just a Laker fan not tolerating a Celtic homer.  Great set for anyone that loved this era of the NBA.",1359331200,,1315,4.585470085470085

2705431,5,B000LC3IH4,"What can you say? If you're a Laker fan, anytime you can see a game where you beat the Celtics is enjoyable and worth it. Quality was very good considering that over 25 years have gone by. Very satisfied.",1322438400,,204,4.256410256410256
2705452,5,B000LC3IH4,"There are two reasons why I purchased this DVD release of the 1985 NBA Finals (the Lakers' ""Return to Glory""):

One, the game was played better and with more of the fundamentals (shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, defense, etc.) by such experts of the game as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and more.

Two (the more important reason), the telecasts were covered better, and what I mean by that is that the screen wasn't clogged up with scorebars and other stats and graphics that got in the way of the action. CBS was the network of the NBA then, and these DVDs prove why, at least to me, their coverage is/was unsurpassed, and remains so. For one thing, their NBA title sequence then (created by Bill Feigenbaum) was built around what, it has been said, appeared to be a computer-generated replica of the great Boston Garden. It had such elements as a green scoreboard that rotated into place in the top middle of the screen, an animated CBS camera that made a 90-deg. loop from the lens to the viewfinder, and a basketball that found its way into the hoop and became the eyeball of the CBS ""eye device"" (on a rectangular ""CBS Sports NBA [World Championship]"" title that zoomed out to the left from the ""eye device""). Another thing is that CBS' score display, for the most part, only appeared when either side scored, and remained on screen for about a second (longer at commercial breaks). The game announcers (Stockton/Heinsohn) and the pregame presenter (Musburger) were also head-and-shoulders above the ABC/ESPN people (although of course Brent Musburger is currently with ABC/ESPN).

This DVD release of the 1985 Finals (known then as the NBA World Championship) comes on 7 DVDs in four slipcases. The first three cases contain the 6 games of the Finals (two per case), although for some unknown reason, the first game from the Boston Garden is incomplete, in that the balance of the first half is missing. I am, however, giving Warner Bros./NBA Entertainment the benefit of the doubt, in that the Boston Celtics had already run up a huge lead in the missing first 22 min. or so of gameplay, thereby leading to this game being known as the ""Memorial Day Massacre."" The third game has a real treat for the ears: for the balance of the 4th quarter there, legendary Lakers announcer Chick Hearn takes over. You'll get to hear the colorful mannerisms of this oft-renowned announcer; he had such well-known turns of phrase as ""in the refrigerator,"" ""boo-birds,"" and ""air-mail special,"" among others. The games can be played all at once or by chapters (except for the first game, which has a ""partial 2nd quarter"" chapter, and chapters for the third and fourth quarters). Where the first game picks up, there is a status bar at the bottom of the screen that runs for the first few minutes explaining why that game started with 2 min. remaining in the first half.

The final disc is an hour-long recap of the road to this NBA Finals matchup, also called ""Return to Glory,"" presented by CBS NBA announcer Dick Stockton. It is divided into 8 chapters, which, like the games, you can see all at once or by chapter.

The slipcases that contain the games include the stats from each game, such as the score (both by quarters and the final score), player stats, and shooting percentages for 2-pointers, 3-pointers, and free throws. They also indicate the dates and venues of the games, and the names of the officials.

All told, if you're looking for well-played and well-covered NBA basketball, you cannot go wrong in purchasing this release of the 1985 NBA Finals.",1294185600,3,3584,4.79126213592233

I forsee more purchases of this DVD series in the future.  Presented well and captures the essence of game through the interviews and the voices calling the games, it really takes you back in time, very memorable.

2705455,4,B000LC3IH4,"I am really thankful for these DVD sets from the NBA as I did not get a chance to watch this series during it's original run. The Showtime Lakers, of course, are legendary. Along with 5 NBA championships and 9 Finals appearances, the 1985 team was the first Lakers team to finally beat the hated Celtics in the Finals.

This 7 DVD-set contains the six Finals games along with the 84-85 championship video. This would've been perfect except for the missing parts of game 1. One note I'd like to make. Dick Stockton is one colorful commentater. With 4:47 left in the 4th quarter, the Celtics bench jump to their feet after a timeout. Dick Stockton: ""the celtics bench, is UP and AROUSED"".

Also, the legendary Lakers commentator Chick Hearn is given some air time for about a quarter during one game. It was nice hearing him and his trademark expressions. I wish this set would've included an alternate track with Chick's radio broadcast, would've been a fun listen. Legendary series, Lakers vs. Celtics.

2705457,5,B000LC3IH4,"What a wonderful trip down memory lane. This was the era when basketball was fun to watch. The Lakers of the 80's had alot of scoring along with run,run, and more running. With Kareem, Magic, Worthy and company, the Lakers had the perfect combination of height,speed and depth that led to a World Championship. It is a shame that game one is not complete, since this may have been a motivating factor for the rest of the series. It also was a real treat to hear Chick Hearn from the radio broadcast during one of the games. I grew up listening to Chick during the '70's and '80's. He was the best at describing the action along with his ""word's eye view"" and his catch phrases, ""the light is out in the refrigerator"", and ""no harm, no foul,no blood, no ambulance"". The Lakers should have beaten the Celtics last time but due to bad passing and not playing smart, they still beat the Celtics 2 out of 3 during the '80's. Bring back all of these classic games.",1253923200,,958,4.387640449438202
2705458,5,B000LC3IH4,"I recorded this series on video from TV back in the day and kept them around all these years. I just bought this dvd box set and the quality is excellent. So far I only watched games 2 & 3 from this new dvd set. It's cool that they kept the old CBS introduction and music with the digital basketball bouncing into the net. My only complaint on game 2 is that the picture flips at different times throughout the first half - enough to be annoying. Game 3 cuts over to the Chick Hearn broadcast in the 4th quarter and the video quality looks even better than the 1st 3 quarters on CBS.

It's refreshing to see a clean picture while watching these games, and by clean I mean no stupid digital crap jumping in your face and clogging the TV screen as today's media crew loves to overdo the tricks while blocking the action.

And for those who complain that the entire game 1 isn't shown - you must be Celtic fans. I saw that game once and I don't care to view it again. Those were imposters in the purple jerseys that day - not the Lakers I knew. I pretty much recorded over that one too! (kept the 1st quarter I think)

I give this 5 stars so far. I want to see the 1984 NBA series come out on dvd too so I can get a sharp copy of the Lakers blowing out the Celtics (with a record 47 pts in one quarter!) in game 3 that year.

If you can't handle the short shorts from this era, don't get the dvd. If like me you hate the skirts that players (and all guys) wear these days then this is the dvd for you.",1213660800,,1498,4.0
2705459,5,B000LC3IH4,"This is the first Laker video product I've seen that features full length games, not the ""to fit into two hours including commercials"" versions you see on NBA TV or ESPN Classic.  And it includes all 6 games, some of which have not been shown even in classic telecasts.

And as a final bonus, one game is incomplete.  And the missing part is most of the first half of game 1, with the Celts running out to a 75-44 lead.  What a shame that was lost for posterity!

If you lived through that series, the most satisfying in Lakers history for this almost 4 decades fan, or even if you're too young to had the pleasure, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection.",1181606400,3,670,4.244094488188976

Most teams would have thrown in the towel after that beatdown but not these guys. You could see the fire in their eyes and the determanation from game 2 on to winning the title in 6 on Boston's home court.
