5786949,5,B00DB97LMW,"We really like Blue Bloods, but are somewhat sad, because Tom Selleck probably won't make any more Jesse Stone Dvd's. We have all of those and were looking forward to several more, but now with Blue Bloods, Tom may feel he is too old to be Jesse again. Blue Bloods looks to us to be good for a few more seasons.",1393891200,,311,4.114754098360656
5786950,5,B00DB97LMW,The set has been a great purchase. The family values in each episode are an added benefit to the insights of police life.

5786983,5,B00DB97LMW,My favorite show so I ordered the season pack to watch when tv has nothing interesting on it. I could watch Blue Bloods over and over again.,1427500800,,140,4.222222222222222
5786984,4,B00DB97LMW,Love the show and the videos too.,1426723200,,33,3.857142857142857

5786988,5,B00DB97LMW,"We don't watch many TV series, but based on recommendations, purchased all three seasons, never having seen any episodes.  WOW, we fell in love with the entire Reagan family.  There all human, and easily seen as real, not perfect, but great role models.  But one of the best atrtributes is that the language is acceptable.  We've only been to NYC a couple of times, and this series takes you everywhere.  The photography is excellent, and the street scenes make you feel you are not on a sound stage in the back lot of an old LA movie studio.  Sunday dinner's bring memories of home, and always brings the family back to earth and each other as the primary support [and accountability] group.  After a few of the 15-17 episodes from season one, we bought season 4 and can't wait to get season 5 currently airing.  We don't watch regular TV, so we'll have to wait until season 5 is released.  You won't be disappointed in this excellent all family program.",1426118400,,955,4.570588235294117

5787010,5,B00DB97LMW,"My TV isn't hooked up to anything but a DVD player and I don't rely on my computer for instant videos. It's only word of mouth from friends, or my own whimsy to buy DVDs for my viewing enjoyment. However, with Tom Selleck as patriarch in this series I figured this had to be good.  I was NOT disappointed.  It's excellent!  The complete cast is superb and every episode is top notch. No worries.....I'll be purchasing more of the series shortly!",1421193600,,445,4.469135802469136

5787074,5,B00DB97LMW,"Cop dramas have come and gone over the years. Many have become the fodder of our jokes as in Gag Me and Mace Me. Many have stood the trite ""Test of Time"" as in Colombo. Miami Vice was cutting edge, flashy, always used hit music as opposed to studio bands preforming covers. Hill Street Blues was the first show that broke out from the Dragnet and Kojak pigeon hole depicting the humanistic side of those who protect and serve. Now after dozens of police procedurals on the small screen, along comes Blue Bloods with Mr Tom Selleck in the first chair. For me, an old guy who never was trendy or ratings conscious, this show out shines them all! I mean, CSI shows cant even decide which one will carry the torch. What is there, 6 variants with CSI in the title? Well, neither here nor there I suppose. I like Blue Bloods as I have not liked a show for decades. The family bond is like none other ever put out there, well maybe save be for Duck Dynasty. No, really . . . . the Reagan table is such a believable counter point to the rest of the police necessities. The violence and crime is always in the plot as one would expect, however it is not shoved in the viewer's face. It is dealt with in a  . . . . well in a civil manor, if you will. Again, I like it. The drama moves me. I am honored to have the first three years in my home. I will collect them all!",1400889600,33,1358,4.086142322097379
