3904474,4,B002C6VMJ8,"I was actually sent Animal Armageddon Target Earth (wide screen), not the version I ordered (Animal Armageddon (Full)), but nowhere did it explain the difference between the two.  It turns out that the one I received  is episodes 1 - 4 of the eight episode series, but nowhere did I see that.  It should have been part of the description.  I still have no idea what the difference is between the two versions, other than Target Earth being longer by a few minutes.  Possibly the one marked (Full) is a full-screen version, but that was not clarified anywhere.  My first thought when I saw there were two versions was that the one marked full might contain all eight episodes, but since it was shorter than the Target Earth one, I decided that couldn't be right.  I hope when Animal Planet decides to release episodes 5 - 8 of Animal Armageddon that they will indicate in the write-up that it is the second half of the series so I will know to order it.",1281484800,3,952,4.468208092485549
3904475,5,B002C6VMJ8,"We bought this DVD for my son, who is keen on watching any documentary on dinosaurs and prehistoric animals. He finds it very entertaining and he discovered other episodes on YouTube. Is a second DVD about to be released? We would certainly be interested.",1265414400,,255,4.818181818181818
3904476,5,B002C6VMJ8,arrived very timely.  it is a christmas gift so have not watched it yet.,1259625600,,72,4.142857142857143
3904477,3,B002C6VMJ8,"was ok i expected more animation and less talk from the profs.
probably would not have bought it if i'd known this.",1259193600,,115,4.2727272727272725
3904478,4,B002C6VMJ8,"Over all, the film is pretty good. But keep in mind that many of Peter Ward`s theories are controversial to say the least. So take
them with a grain of salt.
Like so many ""documentaries"" about the prehistoric world, you have to use the term ""documentary"" a bit loosely since there are really
so few hard facts to go on. Much of it is best guess and or speculative. And this one is no different.
But keeping that in mind, the ideas are thought provoking and worth consideration even if they are far from proven.",1257638400,4,510,4.378947368421053
8363394,5,B002C6VMJ8,"This review is for the (Spain Import), from Celestial Arch Dvd.  If you want *all* the episodes in the original high quality, this is the one to get.  It has the original American English Language version, along with the primary Spanish Language version.  The menu is in Spanish, but it is simple enough to choose the English version, if so desired.

I have ""Animal Armageddon: Target Earth"" which only has the first 4 episodes.  The Spain Import version has all 8 episodes in the same good quality as the ""Target Earth"" version.  The conclusion would be that these certainly appear to have been created from the original production source, not a source of lesser quality.

Each DVD starts with the Producing Company's name and a serial/authorization number.  In fact, that is the only downside: the user cannot fast forward or skip that intro.  Also, as the seller clearly states, these are in the PAL format, so you'll need a player capable of playing that format.

As other reviewers have said, some of the theories are speculative. There are some conjectures that are good for show, but short on generally accepted fact.  Also, there are a few goofs (e.g. the available evidence has it that a Dunkleosteus didn't weigh 20,000 tons, as they say...20,000 pounds would be a stretch).  However, this is part of the fun...

The CGI (at the time the series was originally made) is great for a TV show.  The overall production quality is excellent.  The emphasis on making the subject matter feel exciting and fresh is what made this show so much fun to watch.  And it still is...

EDIT 2018-02-25: When I bought it, it was the last one they had.  As of now, looks like they have more in stock.",1519516800,,1691,4.6745762711864405
8363395,3,B002C6VMJ8,"This show is about the five biggest mass extinctions in Earth's history. Ordovician extinction is not my favorite episode. The CGI is not up to date and the prehistoric animals look more robotic than their actual movements. Permian and Triassic extinctions are the more accurate episodes. All the scientists in the series are very knowledgeable and know what they are talking about. It's a decent show, just wish they took more time to make the animals more realistic.",1497830400,,468,5.012820512820513
8363396,4,B002C6VMJ8,"I love this series. However, there was one more episode that featured when it was one television. I think it was called ""The Next Extinction"", showing what would happen if an asteroid hit the Earth modern day. For some reason it isn't in the DVD. In fact, the only place I can find it is on YouTube. And even that got taken down. A real bummer because that's my favorite episode.

But, if you're looking for a great documentary featuring mass extinction, this is a good start. Keep in mind it mixes people with the animation, meaning you'll see professionals as they talk about the facts. Normally I hate this and prefer purely animation, but its a nice mix that isn't repetitive.",1487462400,,680,4.573770491803279

8363398,5,B002C6VMJ8,"This is a unique documentary film, which tells of the 5 mass extinctions that occurred in the entire history of the Earth. But at the end of the viewing audience are in for a surprise. The creators of this scientific series decided to show the possibility of a 6th mass extinction that could happen in our time. Each episode created plausible. We learn about giant animals and fish that once inhabited our Earth. Let us follow the way they hunted, how they themselves became victims. And eventually, we learn of the sad fate that befell them. This film is designed by professionals and I recommend it to all people who are interested in the history of the Earth.",1431129600,,662,4.61864406779661
8363399,5,B002C6VMJ8,This speculates on the possible events that led to different extinctions and the presentation gives overview on the eras of animal life that are less well known like the Ordovician. Well presented and extremely interesting.,1386288000,2,223,5.4
8363400,5,B002C6VMJ8,"The show is great and awesome it has extinctions in it you probably have never heard of. The DVD only includes episodes 1-4 out of all 8 episodes.

DVD includes:

1. Death Rays

2. Hell on Earth

3. Doomsday

4. Panic in the Sky

DVD DOES NOT INCLUDE:

5. The Great Dying

6. Strangled

7. Fire and Ice

8. The Next Extinction

It is very educational and is NOT recommend for ages 10 or under. It has CGI animation and really great graphics and used to be on Animal Planet. It also includes the 10 top extinct animals special feature. Did this review help you?",1378944000,8,560,4.238095238095238
8363401,5,B002C6VMJ8,Although I wished the show was a lot longer than it is I am still over-all with my purchase. Thank you!,1367625600,,103,3.9523809523809526
8363402,5,B002C6VMJ8,"A great educational ceries.  Yes, it is a bit overdramatized, and yes - animation could have been better, but it addresses very important moments in the Earth History and makes you think of all aspects of extinction, struggle for survival, evolutionary opportunities and critical events in Earth's History.  Excellent group of scientinsts with great thoughts and ideas.  Animal Planet (or Discovery?)  need to rush out the DVD with the remaining 4 episodes!  Please!",1364601600,3,466,5.328767123287672
8363403,5,B002C6VMJ8,"This movie arrived very quickly and brand new still had the wrapper on it very good condition. It's a long movie about 2 hours and its just very entertainig, it shows different scenes of ancient animals like euripterids that are not seen very often in dinosaur movies. Shows how they could have died. The scenes are a little dark but I think that is because of the settings on my TV, I can see them fine just too dark sometimes whenthey are underwater.",1294963200,,452,4.457831325301205
