Having enjoyed Director Mike Newell's previous effort in 4 Weddings and A Funeral, and always enjoying John Cusacks performances, it doesn't let down on that  front.  Also you have to like Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett who  deliever.
For such a stellar cast, though, the script is noticably  lacking.  It could have been a brilliant movie.  Instead it's just  enjoyable but unmemorable.  Rent it, don't bother buying.",939945600,,479,5.038461538461538

He didn't stop talking about it for two weeks!!! The cast is perfect, the screenplay is excellent, the comedy is exactly what I like...subtle and not over the top.

1055547,5,6305575762,"I can't recall a single movie about air traffic controllers before this one.  I can recall plenty about pilots, flying, and airplanes, but nothing comes to mind in regards to air traffic controllers.  This film exposes one of the most stressful jobs out there and corrects a number of misconceptions I've had about the occupation.  While I am sure that the bomb threat scene would never be done after 9/11, this film is as much a window into the controllers' world as it was when it first came out in 1999.  Joining an elite group of air traffic controllers in New York City led by John Qusack is Billy Bob Thornton, a quiet but confident man who quickly proves that he may replace Qusack as the top guy.  Thornton was more eccentric in this role and that made me like him a bit less.  Qusack was fun to watch even when his life was falling apart...I know, I'm sick.  Angelina Jolie seemed to be trying too hard to play the despondent, alcoholic wife to Thornton's character.  As for Qusack's on-screen wife, Cate Blanchett, she was pretty bland.  She just seemed to be there so Qusack could have a wife.  Sure, that factor seemed to be important for the plot, but come on!  The woman's entitled to a real personality.  The plot itself was interesting and I honestly have no idea how much of the technical airplane and flying stuff was accurate.  I did find the very ending quite corny.  The resolutions before it were fine and the resolution between Qusack, Thornton, and, to a certain extent, Jolie was done really well.  But that finally resolution was so corny and so would not happen today.  But nevertheless, it's still a good film and I have no problem awarding it these five stars.  Enjoy.",1404259200,,1697,4.566225165562914

1055628,2,6305575762,"I'm a former controller, and found the TRACON scenes almost unbearable. When the first airliner ""fails to tag"" (info in the data block is missing) and two planes are on what could be a collision course, the entire facility comes to a halt while controllers cluster around watching. Just ain't gonna happen!!! Everybody on duty is working a different sector, with their own conflicts to sort out. Why would things come to an abrupt halt just because two A/C were about to take the shower?
Fights in on the CR floor? Are you nuts!??! Asking another controller for an airplane to fill a gap? Oh, yeah, the guy's going to pluck a 747 out of the sky and move him into position. Grrrrrrrr.
Some other ""irregularities"" are nitpicking. Like two overwhelmed scope jockeys finding time between transmissions to converse, pilots not acknowledging instructions by announcing their ID.. Passengers being served drinks just moments before touchdown.. But these are mere irritants.
(If there's anybody reading this, and they are interested in what really happens, log on to liveatc.com, and listen in to New York -KJFJ--approach and discover how these guys do it, cooly and rapidly.)
Oddly enough, the reason air travel is safe these days is in part because everything is nice and dull and orderly.

As for the story... well, I guess the message was that tin pushers are whackos and jump into the sack with every hot and even whackier person who comes along. Yes, I used to go out and lay down on runways as big jets landed a few feet away.

Acting was good (Cusack's and Thornton are always solid), photography was top-rate, editing sound. But way, way too hard to believe by anybody with any understanding of big-time aviation.",1381881600,2,1714,4.84641638225256

The performances by John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie (22 then) and Cate Blanchett (30 then) are outstanding--the final days of who we were before 9/11, and the twin towers still standing.  The symbolism of letting the fish go--(""I know I caught him, and he knows I caught him"" says BBT's character Russel)-- adds a moment of art to the obsessive-compulsive Cusack saga that helps him begin to heal.

Finally,after quite an upsetting battle of nerves, all Nick can hope to do is to regain his professional status and patch up his failing marriage by the end of the picture.

The movie sheds light on a New York air traffic controller who seems to have it all, but whose life takes a sharp turn for the worst from the moment a new transfer arrives to work by his side...
The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.
The acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the humor and the plot are just about average.
Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...
In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.

1055844,2,6305575762,"I thought it sounded quite interesting, plus, I seem to be going through a serious Billy Bob phase at the moment, and it's the film where he & Angelina met, and got married. And then divorced.

The first half hour of the film is quite interesting, if they'd kept it up throughout it wouldn't have got a 1 star rating from me. I found it very interesting that all these guys are in control of the planes in the skies, and how close they can come close to making a mistake. Thank God I'm not going on a plane anytime soon!!! But unfortunately, it went downhill, and I have to admit, I find John Cusack the most boring, uninspiring actor behind Clive Owen. He just has nothing to him. Emotionless, expressionless.

Now Billy Bob is an entirely different matter. This guy is cute. He's nearly almost completely deadpan during what I did watch of this, and the one time I caught him smile, I saw a guy I know in Billy Bob. But he has more hair ;) If only he stayed like this in real life. He scrubs up well for films, then is a scruff in real life. Him & Angelina were the only saving graces about this film, but even then I couldn't even watch it all.

Angelina is definitely looking good in this, she has really cute hair, and a cute fringe to boot. She knows she appeals to both men & women, and shows it. She speaks incredibly quietly in this, there's none of her usual sassiness showing.

I'm just not sure what it was about this film, that I didn't like. It just seemed to go downhill, and be the same old, same old after a while. I gave up (which I seem to be doing a LOT lately on films, my mind keeps drifting to bigger & better things), and I'm not sure whether to keep it or not.

1055847,3,6305575762,"Perfessor Mom Pressfour here, film critic and Jolie fan extraordinaire.  *Pushing Tin* (1999) is an odd film that stars John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Vickie Lewis, Jake Weber, Kurt Fuller, Matt Ross, Jerry Grayson and Michael Willis.  Mike Newell (*Four Weddings and a Funeral*) directs.

I call it odd because while *Pushing Tin* is technically well-made, and features good acting, and has an interesting, different premise, and starts off well...it begins to go flat a little past the halfway point.  By the end--the scene of Nick (Cusack) talking from ground control to his wife Connie (Blanchett) in the cockpit of an airliner--the movie is unwatchable.  It's a 2-hour long film that plays half an hour longer than it's worth.  I didn't see it in cinema, I know it only from DVD--but it's more than likely that when it played the theaters,  many more people were seated for the start of *Pushing Tin* than the finish.  John Cusack, the headline star, summed it up: ""It wasn't very good.""

But still it was a big boost for Angelina Jolie's career.  Her last scene, with Cusack in the car on a rainy day, marks the peak of the movie's interest curve.  After this, it's all downhill.  Thus the better part of *Pushing Tin* is Ms Jolie's part.

She plays Mary Bell, wife of Russel, an air traffic controller.  Like many a Jolie character, there's more to Mary than meets the eye.  Naturally what meets the eye is very easy to look at.  Angelina is absolutely stunning in this movie.  In her fifth scene--her return to the Italian restaurant, this time with her husband--she's dressed as the real Angelina Jolie is known to often dress: in leather pants and a snug-fitting dark sleeveless top.  Sexy times ten.  But Mary is not only a shapely piece of eye candy.  She's trained as a social worker but hasn't found work.  She feels she could do more with her life.  Fond of all kinds of books, Mary likes to read (as does the real Jolie). Growing plants is her hobby.  Her husband keeps to himself (IDIOT!), leaves Mary alone at night a lot, and though she doesn't seem to resent him for it, she's lonely.  Whether it's just due to loneliness or something else too, Mary drinks.  A lot.

I mentioned a couple of Ms Jolie's scenes; I should summarize all six by number.  The first is at the house party hosted by one of Russel's colleagues.  Mary causes a stir among the crowd of suburban-looking air traffic controllers and their wives by showing up dressed like a biker chick: in a leather coat and a short leopardskin-patterned skirt that flatters her ample chest. (""Think they're real?"" asks one wife cattily of another behind Mary's back.  ""If they are,"" comes the answer, ""we'll have to kill her."") In all of her scenes Mary wears the same garish set of jade jewellry on her neck, wrists and fingers.  She speaks softly with a pleasant Southern accent.  At the party she's cool, distant, but ever-so-slightly potty, showing little interest in anyone or anything other than her husband and the mixed drinks Nick serves at the outdoor bar.  Mary's second scene is in the supermarket where Nick finds her crying.  One of her plants died that day, her husband has taken off for the night, and, well, the poor girl is just overcome.  More out of pity than anything else, Nick invites her to an Italian restaurant.  Mary's dinner with Nick is the third scene.  It's my favorite.  She loosens up here--as she tells Nick, ""I'm not as big a bitch as you think I am""--and shows him just how charming she can be.  Mary unleashes this smile that could level a forest!  Poor Nick...the sweet sap of his well-intentioned concern for his colleague's unhappy wife ferments into intoxicating lust.  The fourth scene is the logical result.  Nick and Mary end up in bed together at Russel's house.  (Ms Jolie wears a bra throughout this scene, but during the filming it slipped, exposing her nipples.  No loss...)  It's as this scene closes that Jolie speaks one of her oft-quoted lines: ""What's the fewest number of words you can use to get out that door?""  The fifth scene is at the restaurant again.  Nick feels guilty about the tryst with Mary, so he takes his wife Connie out to dinner.  But in the meantime Mary must have told Russel about this nice Italian place, because Nick and Connie walk in to find them there.  Nick is mortified.  Connie, however, is pleased (she has no idea what happened between her husband and Mary). The two couples end up sharing one table.  Russel takes over, becoming the center of attention for both women.  This is the first step in an eventual affair between Russel and Connie.  The sixth and last Jolie scene is when Nick meets Mary in a rainy parking lot.  They talk in her car.  She's called him there to let Nick know she's told Russel about their night together. ""ARE YOU NUTS?"" he shouts at her.  Taking a swig from a pocket flask, Mary purrs, ""I'm way too sober for this.""  He bolts from her car, giving it a kick before he runs to his own and roars away.

The other reason this movie is odd for me is that Russel, the husband of Jolie's character, is played by Billy Bob Thornton.  This was the start of their much-publicized real-life romance and marriage, a phase of Ms Jolie's life that in hindsight is embarrassing.  You can't watch *Pushing Tin* without remembering them kissing and feeling one another up before the press...the ""Billy Bob"" tats on Jolie's right shoulder and another part of her anatomy...the insistent declarations of love until death...the phials of blood...

Ah well, everybody makes mistakes no matter how well they do in life.  That's the central theme of *Pushing Tin*.  A quotation from an air-traffic controller starts the movie: *You land a million planes safely, then you have one little mid-air and you never hear the end of it.""",1121990400,6,5829,4.677165354330708
1055848,5,6305575762,"Nick Falzone (John Cusack) is at the top of his profession, the number one air traffic controller servicing one of the busiest airports in the U.S.A. Nicknamed ""the zone"" he is the epitomy of focus and control. This need to be the best is not restricted to the control tower, but permeates every aspect of his life. At first it appears that Nick is the master of his own destiny, unbeatable in everything he puts his mind to. That is until a fellow employee breaks down on the job and Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton) is hired to replace him.

Russell may be new to this particular airport, but he has a reputatiion amongst fellow air traffic controllers that has reached almost 'urban legend' proportions. Known as a maverick, a headcase, a lunatic, but also a brilliant air traffic controller, rumor has it that Russell was fired from his last job for laying on a runway in front of an oncoming 747. Whether truth or fable, Russell is given a second chance and his reputation as a highly skilled controller is evident from his first day on the job. Nick realizes his position at the top of the heap may be in imminent danger.

Hoping to study his new rival in a different setting, Nick invites Russell and his wife to his home for a company party. Up until now Nick's wife Connie (Cate Blanchett) had been considered the prettiest wife amongst co-workers. However when Russell's wife Mary (Angelina Jolie) arrives at the party it becomes immediately obvious that a new consensus of opinion has been reached. Now the competition really begins.

Nick's obsession for outdoing Russell escalates. Russell on the other hand plays along with the pretense of competition while remaining unattached and emotionally undivested in what the outcome may be. You see Russell has already passed through his own ""dark night of the soul"" and has overcome his inner demons. He has no further need or desire to prove anything to anyone. That of course is what bothers Nick most of all. For a man like Nick one of the major benefits to winning and being number one is the acknowledgement of defeat from your opponent. For Russell there is no defeat, for there was no competition.

As Nicks' life disintergrates around him Connie moves out after learning he slept with Mary. He eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and is given a leave of absence from his job. Alone and emotionally shattered, his once famous ability to focus and control every situation has been called into question. His only hope now is Russell, someone who has already been there. Russell shows him the folly of his obsession and points him towards a new perspective of reality. To fully embrace this new way of life a rite of passage is required, one that demands trust and bravery. Will Nick have the courage to see it through to the end?

1055851,4,6305575762,"Starring John Cusack as an air traffic controller, Pushing Tin introduced me to a scary world where split-second decisions can decide the fate of planes full of people, where  being good enough to do this job and command good salaries requires quick thinking, fast talking and steady nerves.  Set in pre-9/11 New York, I'm familiar with the neighborhoods and the skyline and I must say that every time a camera panned the World Trade Center, I got a little twinge.  The year the film was made, 1999, comes across as a much more innocent age.

Anyway, John Cusack is married to Cate Blanchett and they live with their children in an area that looks like Staten Island or Queens.  She's a real babe in this film and plays her part well, being so good at her New York accent that I could have sworn she had grown up in Brooklyn.

When Billy Bob Thornton, an air traffic controller from another part of the country, is transferred into the New York area, there is immediate competition between the two men. They compete on the job and I realized that the term ""pushing tin"" means pushing the planes on their computer screens through the complicated ritual of landing in a way to make sure they come in on time.  This sometimes requires big risks be taken, as these planes have to be very delicately manipulated.

The two men also compete for women.  Billy Bob is also married to a babe, Angelina Jolie, and it doesn't take long for the two couples to get caught up in a romantic web.  There's tension throughout as bedroom shenanigans seem to be getting out of hand and Billy Bob's propensity for unpredictable violent behavior becomes more and more threatening.

Acting was excellent, and I loved the cinematography of the planes and the skylines.  The romances were a little silly and maybe that was why the film is billed as a comedy, but it really didn't matter because I was totally caught up in the story itself.  Certainly, Pushing Tin gave me a new understanding about the challenges of keeping airline passengers safe in the sky and the jobs of the people who do this for a living.",1082764800,,2086,4.590296495956873
1055886,4,6305575762,"Presentes by british director Mike Newell, PUSHING TIN with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton hasn't had much success at the box office last summer. Why ? Cusack and Thornton are both excellent actors, Newell directed two great hits in the recent years, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and DONNIE BRASCO with Al Pacino, and the comedy genre is generally appreciated by international audiences.
So, it's a weak screenplay. NO ! In my opinion, PUSHING TIN's screenplay is one of the smartest of 1999. At least, for a non-american audience. Imagine John Cusack impersonating THE air-traffic controller of your worst nightmares : big mouth, cafeine-loaded and willing to stay the best even if it means to endanger hundreds of lives.
So, what a relief when appears Billy Bob Thornton, a half-breed Choctaw (an american-indian nation), with a sexy wife and a politically not so correct attitude. His motorcycle (not a Harley...) is faster than Cusack's car, he can handle more airplanes on his screen and beats Cusack's records when playing basket-ball.
So, with subtlety, Mike Newell attacks a certain number of american attitudes or certitudes. Now do you understand why PUSHIN TIN had no success at all ?

1055888,4,6305575762,"This is one of these movies where two diametrically different characters, Nick Falzone(John Cusack) and Russell Bell(Billy Bob Thornton), go head-to-head in a battle of wits and testosterone to see who is the better man.  One will fall to an all-time low, while the other rediscovers himself and helps the man who has fallen.
As Air Traffic Controllers for one of the worlds busiest TRACONs, the New York-New Jersey air corridor, Nick and Russell are working in one of the most high-stress jobs around.  Nick is known as ""The Zone"" for his ability to ""push tin"" faster than any other air traffic controller.  Nick and his tight-knit group of work buddies are suddenly thrown a curve ball when Russell Bell transfers in from Denver.  At first, they assume Russell is just another back-woods controller who won't make the cut.  But, Russell has a unique talent for pushing tin that bothers Nick.  Suddenly, this guy, who wears a feather in his headset and carries his own wooden chair to work is making Nick look bad.  Nick has finally met his match.
Rumors and video tape about Russell soon fly all over the TRACON and upset the finite balance Nick and his buddies have.  Nick is so bothered by this mysterious character that he tries to push a few of Russell's buttons, but to no avail.  Everyone, including Nick's wife Connie, find Russell ""interesting"".
At the same time, Nick finds Russell's wife equally intriguing.  It's not long before marraige vows are broken and friendships are strained, with Nick coming out the loser. Nick Falzone has to go to extraordinary lengths to undo the damage.  In the end, Russell Bell is the one who saves him.
I didn't quite know what to expect when I bought this movie.  I must admit, I had stereotyped Billy Bob Thornton as some hick who had made a short break in the movies, but I was completey wrong about him. And, John Cusack was not on my short list of favorite actors, either.  But when these two actors were cast together for this movie, the outcome was nothing short of hilarious.  Angelina Jolie played a great supporting role as Russell's inebriated wife.  Just a funny and satisfying movie from start to finish.  And, Im now a Billy Bob Thornton fan.
If you liked this movie, I highly recommend you see 'Bandits'.",1055116800,8,2265,4.710659898477157

The women they married to became the victims of their egos during the power struggle.  Although Mr. Thornton's character is supposed to be very 'zen' but it's obvious that Mr. Cusack's character has his buttons pushed.  Very amusing to see in one high pressure working environment, two male 'peacocks' are pitting against each other.  :)
Mr. Thornton shows his tremendous amount of charm as the zen master Russell Bell.  The chemistry between him and Miss Jolie was palpable.  No wonder they married each other after finishing this movie.  Their characters seem close to their real life characters and any viewer can 'see' what a good match this is!
Mr. Cusack is as usual relatable and real as can be.  No wonder he commends a royal following among his fans.  Miss Blanchette's transformation into a suburban Jersey wife is amazing.

1055891,3,6305575762,"Pushing Tin is a slang term used by air traffic controllers. It refers to moving all those commercial jetliners around the sky as they prepare for landing. It's well know that this is a high stress job. I would never consider it. I got stressed out just watching the controllers in Pushing Tin doing their jobs, and they were only actors. I have a hard enough time ""landing"" my car in our garage without taking out the trash cans.
To enjoy this movie, you have to understand that it is a comedy. Even knowing that, the humor will prove too dry or sophisticated for some viewers' tastes. John Cusack plays Nick Falzone, a decent, dedicated guy who has been working in the air traffic control profession for fifteen years. His wife, Connie [Kate Blanchett], not only adores him, she understands how much pressure his job puts on him. Despite his attempts to maintain an even keel, it is obvious by watching him and his coworkers at work and play, that the balance is precarious at best. One day a new employee arrives. Russell Bell [Billy Bob Thornton] is a quiet, eccentric guy, who has never fit in anywhere a day in his life. He also has a work style that is unnerving to the other employees, especially Nick. Russell is much faster and more aggressive in lining up those big hunks of tin in the sky. This causes fiction between Nick and Russell, and soon a great competition ensues. The battle spill out of the workplace when Nick unwittingly gets too close to Russell's beautiful wife, Mary [Angelina Jolie]. Russell will prove to be the catalyst that sends Nick over the edge.
There are scenes in Pushing Tin that are quite funny. There are others that are intense, especially the ones in which the possibility of a midair collision is real. Parts of it seem authentic. We see just how much power a controller has. A pilot has little choice but to fly his plane just as the controller instructs him to. Passengers are happily unaware that, in the landing procedure, the pilot isn't flying the craft. Someone on the ground is.
The stars are all first-rate professionals. John Cusack has lit up the screen in independent classics such as The Grifters and The Player, as well as in big budget films like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Billy Bob Thornton is on my short list of best actors working today. Cate Blanchett won an Oscar nomination for Elizabeth, and Angelina Jolie is an up and coming young actress. They try, but fail to overcome a script problem that is the movie's biggest weakness. Nick and Connie are finely drawn characters, but we never really get to know Russell and Mary, who are essential to the story. We know they are crazy, but, since their presence has such an impact on the other couple, it would be good to know why they behave the way they do. We are left in the dark, and this simply is not good writing. Pushing Tin fails in the character development area. Because of this, the film ends up being lightweight, rather than simply light.",1016668800,7,2977,4.5767790262172285

The best way to describe this film is to say its a dark comedy. The two lead characters are competitive  air traffic control operators.  They spend the majority of the film playing a twisted version of 'anything you can do, I can do better', with hilarious results.
While the film does has funny momments, its not 'roll on the floor' humor, its more subtle.  If you have a quirky sense of humor, give this film a try.  If you're sense of humor is normal, you may not like it.",992822400,2,652,4.4

And Cate Blanchett is amazing as his wife. However after Billy Bob Thornton appears on the scene as a rival air traffic controller with his voluptuous alcoholic wife (played by his now real life wife Angelina Jolie) things take a turn for the worse. The competition between Cusack and Thornton's characters gets to the point of being ridiculous and dangerous. Their infidelities and personal problems are just too out there.

1055894,5,6305575762,"I hadn't heard anything about this movie before I saw it so I didn't expect anything other than the usual Hollywood silliness. I was absolutely delighted to find it a winner. I thought the basic depiction of the ATC's was accurate enough, keeping in mind that it was all exaggerated to make dramatic, humorous, and at times, farcical, points. I do agree that in real life there would have been an awful lot of `say again's in response to Falzone's super-efficient instruction, and my suspension-of-disbelief ability got a bit strained at times. However, it's not a documentary. The ATC background is a set-up for the character-driven plot, and all the characters are multi-dimensional and wonderful, including all the supporting players, and I understood and loved them all. John Cusack is terrific as the tightly-controlled controller Falzone, and Billy Bob Thornton is hilariously morbid as the completely-in-control Russell Bell who gets on, and frays, Falzone's last nerve. Angelina Jolie is perfect as the spiraling-out-of-control tarty lush, as is Cate Blanchett as the housewife who's trying to retain control with her `life of the mind' evening classes. I didn't love the hokey ending, and I'm not saying it was the best movie I've ever seen, but as a comedy that managed to capture human strengths and frailties, not to mention paranoia, it was great.",970012800,3,1360,5.13063063063063
1055935,4,6305575762,"The effects of the job on air traffic controllers in New York is explored  in this film, permeated with dark humor and cleverly presented by director  Mike Newell.  ""Pushing Tin,"" starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton,  takes a look at the close knit ""family"" of the men and women who ""move  blips around on a screen"" and are responsible for the lives of more people  in one day than a surgeon will be in an entire career.  It's a maddening,  high-tension profession that takes it's toll on those who would enter upon  it's nerve shattering, demanding playing field; definitely not a job for  the meek of heart or mind.  Nick Falzone (Cusack) is one of the guys who  can handle this adrenaline-laced life and still manage to keep it all  together for his family:  His wife, Connie (Cate Blanchett), and their two  kids.  But things begin to happen when a new man, Russell Bell (Thornton),  arrives on the job; a cool, off-beat character from out west who brings  along a reputation for moving planes quickly, and a much younger wife, Mary  (Angelina Jolie).  Soon Nick's competitive juices begin to flow, and the  tension level in the control room goes up a notch.  Cusack turns in a  high-powered performance as Falzone, a character perfectly suited to his  quick delivery and sense of timing; he's high-strung, but controlled, and  Cusack very capably conveys the myriad emotional levels derived from a job  with such incredible responsibilities.  As one of the characters comments  in response to a remark about the blips on their screens being like a big  video game, ""Yeah, but there's no restart button.""  What this job requires  is an amazing amount of energy and a clarity of mind few mortals it would  seem could maintain for any great length of time.  One of the interesting  asides of the film is watching the minor diversions used by the various  individuals to keep their focus (Falzone sings to himself, others make  wagers and exercise).  It's a game of fast talk and quick wits, and  Cusack's Falzone is a master at it.  His counterpart is Russell, played  with a subtle, low-keyed approach by Thornton, whose calm in the middle of  the storm lends something of an air of mystery to the proceedings.  He's  enigmatic, wears an Indian feather at work, keeps his thoughts to himself  and leaves little doubt that he marches to the beat of his own drummer.  And Thornton makes it all click to perfection.  Blanchett also turns in a  noteworthy performance as Connie, a strong character who is the anchor in  Nick's tumultuous life; and beautiful Jolie is also memorable as the more  vulnerable and unpredictable Mary Bell.  The strong supporting cast  includes Jake Weber (Barry), Kurt Fuller (Ed), Vicki Lewis (Tina) and Matt  Ross (Ron).  Newell has crafted a highly entertaining, fast paced movie  with snappy dialogue, a good story, and a cast that makes it all work.  ""Pushing Tin"" is a funny, yet serious, look at relationships and a unique  profession for which the phrase ""burned out"" must have been coined.  And  you'll never forget the hilarious scene that involves a man standing on the  runway as a 747 lands; it's something you have to see for yourself, because  words alone will not do it justice.  Check this one out; it's a solid movie  that will give you a whole new perspective on planes and those guys out in  the towers moving them around.  There's a lot of sky up there, but it can  get real small very quickly.",969235200,,3451,4.730964467005077

The person who adapted the screenplay loved the short story too  much, and did a bad job of cutting away the fat.  However, the things that  are left in the movie make for a quirky slow-action, low-on-the-comedy  movie.  Good for Sundance Film festivals.  Bad for short attention  span.

Billy Bob Thornton didn't disappoint  as the stoic rival, and Angelina Jolie gave a halting, tenuous performance,  which is exactly what the movie called for.  Cusack, as always, was Cusack.

From the positive angle- Finally, a movie that let's the average viewer catch an exciting glimpse into the world of air traffic controllers.  Although, real life air traffic controllers would probably like to put  their two cents worth as to what was reality and what was Hollywood  sensationalism ! Also, where did Cusack and Thornton learn to speak so fast  while guiding the pilots and yet maintaining such verbal clarity skills ?  Amazing ! The special videogame-like graphic effects showing a  3-dimensional airspace field on their visual monitors was an incredible  plus. Billy Bob Thornton is one of those rare talents;The audience never  knows exactly what personality he will undertake when doing his characters  until you see him act (exception being Slingblade). Cusack sometimes seems  to always fall in that rut of so many of his previous film characters; His  characters often place themselves in catastrophic predicaments where he  then has to create a plethora of excuses, excuses, and more excuses--and  he's a smooth talker at doing it if it wasn't for his guilty boyish comical  expressions and nervous body language that usually lead him into the demise  of his characters. The humor and sarcastic jokes and comments made by the  various characters throught the film are, at best, sharp and witty. The  icing on the cake was seeing Angelina Jolie ( or rather a little more of  her than was expected). She's sweet candy for the male eyes!
On the  negative perspective- the ending was incredibly hokey (especially with the  pilots allowing their transmission path being used for a ludricous personal  converstion between passenger and air-traffic controller).  The film starts  out spontaneous enough and ends with a typical all too familiar ending. The  last few minutes towards the finale will make some viewers look forward to  a root canal session with their dentist than sit through an ending like  this again !

After watching this movie, I have spent a little  time looking into the profession and its prerequisites. I'm thinking about  attending a school geared toward that profession and ultimately switching  jobs. $100 Grand a year is enough to switch.
Back to the movie...
Buy it  or don't. It's up to you, but I recommend it.",953424000,,707,4.563492063492063
1055987,3,6305575762,"Ohhhhhh boy.  What to say about this one?  All the reviews have mentioned the polished, terrific cast and the clever direction so I'll leave that be for now.  This movie had me, hardcore for the first 45 minutes or so...the  gorgeous transition from ""The Zone's"" POV to his mind's eye view  is beautiful (and slightly underused)and the cast really had me.  Then  enter the neuroses, the competition, the ""human"" story of the ATC  - the battered, bruised, stressed warriors of our skyways - plus the whole  rigamarol between warring hotshot controllers and their wives and egos and  bla-bla-bla....and well, you have a damned fine film that nosedives into  the worst ending since ""Jade"" (it really sucks terribly).  Thornton is super: spectral and friendly, inviting and foreboding.  Cusack  is, as usual - great, even when the plot and dialogue belie the humanity he  brings to the Zone.  Blanchett has a Lon Chaney like flawless  transformation from Britain to Jersey and Jolie just lays me out with her  painful honesty and simplicity (see: the sipermarket scene in this  film)...I just wish that the stunning prescedent set in the first hour or  so was maintained.  All in all - a good rental - but don't buy this damned  thing.",949968000,,1231,4.87378640776699
1055988,2,6305575762,"This is one of those flicks that had me changing the display on the DVD player from ""Elapsed Time"" to ""Remaining Time.""
As I pilot, I found the ATC communications to be refreshingly authentic,  although I can't vouch for the behavior of the controllers.  (And I most  certainly hope that the previous reviewer was kidding when he said the  portrayal of the TRACON environment was realistic.)
The whole plot drags  on and on, without much in the way of twists or diversions.  The characters  are flat, despite the best efforts of the actors, and the script is bland  in addition to being fairly unbelieveable.
I gave this one two stars only  because I was able to stomach watching it all the way through, although I  can't say I enjoyed it.  I can't even recommend a rental here.
If you're  a Cusack fan, you'd be better off buying ""One Crazy Summer.""",948931200,2,850,4.593333333333334

1055990,1,6305575762,"If your a pilot like me and enjoy a good plane flick, this is not the movie for you.  Besides Cate Blanchette being a hotty there is nothing to  this movie.  Not only is there very little quality aviation related  material, it glorifies controllers as hip, hard drinking, cool guys. Give  me a break.",941328000,2,300,4.481481481481482

7892485,5,6305575762,Possibly my favorite buddy movie. Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack both play to type but it works. The scenes in the air traffic control are excellent; if you ever wondered why controllers get ulcers just watch a few minutes of John Cusack speaking at 200 words per minute as he manages his airspace.

7892489,5,6305575762,"Excellent film thanks to the exciting performances by the four lead actors John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett.  All four were terrific to watch as they breathed life into characters that seemed to be stuck in an okay plot, but thanks to them I forgot all about the fact that the story was just okay.  I could tell they were gifted actors able and capable of lifting the story upwards.  Interesting to see Cate Blanchett play a New Jersey woman who takes art classes, after having embodied Queen Elizabeth I beforehand.  Definitely an enigmatic and gifted actress.  Also great to watch Angelina Jolie when she was just a rising star after her Girl Interrupted turn, although she was mildly underused in this and sort of disappears from the screenplay during the last half of the film.",1503705600,,815,4.792857142857143
