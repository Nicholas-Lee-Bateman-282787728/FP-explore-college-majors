8608736,2,B00ERH14U2,Very educational about early porn and the mafia. Dvd was not what I thought it would be. More about Linda.,1410220800,,106,4.35
8608737,5,B00ERH14U2,Very interesting. I remember when the movie Deep Throat came out. It was not much of a movie even for a porno. There were lots of stories about Linda and her version of things changed over the years. This film does a good job of presenting the facts.,1407801600,5,250,4.229166666666667

8608739,5,B00ERH14U2,"For better or worse, Linda Susan Boreman (aka Linda Lovelace, 1949-2002) is an American icon. Having participated in Deep Throat, the most famous adult film in US history, she entered the pantheon of famous luminaries. Yes, sir, just for that. Ah, but she earned it, as her life after that movie was also responsible for some unexpected, yet controversial issues that affect our lives. This is all explored and discussed in the painfully honest, well-researched and illuminating Linda Lovelaces Loose Lips, the Last Interview with Legs McNeil.

Linda Lovelaces life was marked by two incidents: Deep Throat and the publishing of her memoir Ordeal, in 1980. Deep Throat not only is the most famous adult film in US history, as I mentioned before, but is also responsible for creating the so-called Golden Age of Pornography in the US, which lasted from the launching of the film in 1972, to somewhere in the 80s. Linda Lovelaces Loose Lips main star is writer Legs McNeil, who uses parts of Linda Lovelaces alleged last interview, segments featuring clips of some of her pictures, interviews with personnel related to the case, and varied archival footage, to present his case. McNeil, who co-directed the film, divides it into three parts or versions. In the first part, he proceeds to examine the official version of known facts about Lindas life, mostly about her early years, her dominating mother, how she met future husband and manager Chuck Traynor, her early short films (Linda likes em Lewd  1971, The Foot  1971, Piss Orgy  1971), the making of Deep Throat, how Traynor verbally and physically abused her, how Traynor stole her money, the success of her book Ordeal, how the book initiated debate about pornography nationwide, her other romances, and more. In between, there is also a brief history of pornography in the US. On the other hand, in the second version, McNeil turns the tide, and provides evidence against Lovelace, indicating the she was a manipulator and a liar, and how she needed attention from the people. It is here that another short, Dog F_ _ _ _r (the name says it all), gets mentioned, stressing that Lovelace did enjoy pornography  after all, she also did Deep Throat II. The last version is basically an analysis of the two previous versions. At any rate, the viewer will be the judge. The interviews are helpful, particularly those with porn stars Marilyn Chambers, Harry Reems and Sharon Mitchell, as well as Chuck Traynor, FBI agent Bill Kelly, writers Al Goldstein and Eric Danville, and, of course, Miss Lovelace herself.

I recently had the opportunity to watch the film Lovelace, starring Amanda Seyfried, in which Lovelace is portrayed as the victim, as in the first version of Linda Lovelaces Loose Lips, and I have to say that it can be hard to reach a verdict about who is telling the truth. This documentary does a great job in exposing both sides, and it should be required viewing by anybody that remembers those times, as the truth slowly surfaces throughout the years.
