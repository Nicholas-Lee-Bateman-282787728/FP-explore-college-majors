I am happy everything has a digital copy :)

Update:
hey if you want this item get it soon because it's on high demand... i called up and was told it's coming from the disney movie club... their shipping out a limited amount, and after their gone they aren't ordering anymore... they said sometimes they will, but they said they predict this will only be here until about christmas, but may not be that long because it is on high demand...",1317600000,4,946,4.652694610778443
4569039,5,B0054K8JSG,"Yes, this is a really nice chest to store all 4 movies inside. One of the best I have seen. I know that the 5th and 6th movies are going to come out, but that won't be a problem, cuz that golden round disc case can fit about 15 discs. That is plenty of space to fit in future movies inside. Just throw away the digital copies and you are set! :D",1317168000,13,345,3.8055555555555554

4569042,5,B0054K8JSG,"Whats great about this release is that if you have the blu ray release from last year - the trilogy release that is - this does not erase that or make it obsolete - have the digital copies of any of the previous 3 been released? whats included in the 5 disc blu ray pack is also included here!!! even the the 3d blu ray , the blu ray, the dvd and the digial copy
plus the pirates chest - i love how this isn't exaclty duplicate of the previous releases and nice to see disney including digital copies of all 4 plust the 3d version

The only thing I""ll say is that Disney... maybe get with the times. In America, we have a large and growing Hispanic population. I am not Hispanic, but am trying to expand my language base (not to mention that to the North, we have Canada and hence French influences). Maybe have the subtitles/audio available in the major languages of as many places as possible.

Regardless, I was impressed that with the movie Moana, there were subtitles/audio in Spanish.... but not with Pirates? I love Disney, but I might just love it more if it had some movies/subtitles in Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic- any language under the sun. Expand the love.. and respond to the wants of the people.

Across the pond, there are also Irish dialects, Swedish, Scottish, Farsi, Pashtu, Japanese- from Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Mongolia, India- not to mention the myriad countries unnamed  .... Just a few thoughts.",1498780800,,967,5.140127388535032

4569141,1,B0054K8JSG,"If there was a way to award zero or negative stars, I would.  We ordered one set of these Blu-ray videos (NOT the multi-format collection), and none of the disks worked.  We got error messages on all of them, before our player automatically ejected them.  I thought it was a fluke, so I initiated a return through Amazon and ordered a second set from a different seller.  The SAME thing happened again, and it's NOT because the disks aren't compatible with our Blu-ray region.  They ARE,,,supposedly.  I have no idea why this has happened not once, but twice.  All I can figure is that it has something to do with the set being an import (despite the fact that the region IS compatible), or the videos are simply junk knock-offs.  I don't know whether to try to find a NON-imported set or not.  I'm too frustrated to even think about going a third round with this nonsense right now.

Oh.  One more thing.  Don't be mislead by the ""stock photo"" and description provided by the manufacturer.  This set was 4 Blu-rays in a cardboard holder.  It does NOT come in a treasure chest with a map, etc., etc.  If you have little ones you're hoping to thrill with extra baubles, you'll be disappointed.",1496016000,8,1192,4.530516431924883

This seemed like a good time to upgrade my DVDs to Blu-Rays, and this set seemed like the most bang for the buck. Arrived promptly and in good condition. You're getting all four movies each in its own plastic case, all tucked into a single sleeve. The movie transfers look and sound great. If you're after a ton of extra features, this most definitely is not the set for you. Aside from some bloopers, a commentary, and a few other bits and pieces (a couple of games, some short Lego movies) there's not a lot extra here...all of which is fine for the price. Picking up the fully loaded set cost twice as much, from what I could see. This set is an affordable way to pick up the first four movies, and little else besides, for $10.50 per movie.

4569150,4,B0054K8JSG,"I love the series, and my brother wanted to start watching all of the movies to catch up so he can go see the 5th movie in theaters. So I happily got this 4 pack. The movies are great and are all in HD but 3 things kind of bugged me about it. In the first box (Curse of the Black Pearl) the Blu-Ray disk says ""disk 1"" but doesn't have a second disk. It does say it is a blu ray, and works with my player. but there was no slot for a second disk, and seems rather weird that it doesn't come with a second disk or say what the second disk would be. The second thing is more of a personal belief, but the disks from the 2nd and 3rd movie are just blue and say the name of the movie, unlike the 1st and 4th, its not appealing as someone who likes to sometimes open a disk and see the cool designs on the actual disk (best way to put it is that it doesn't look like the disks if you looked at the multi-format version). The 3rd thing is that the 4th movie's box not only came with a broken latch but the two disks in the box fell out when I opened the Box. While the broken box is no huge deal I can get a new box for it and move the sleeve, but the disks flying out is a way to get a scratched disk which is a huge no no.

In otherwords, be aware that the movies are wonderful, the pack is what i would expect for the price and its a good pickup for those younger siblings/children who you want to watch a ""kids"" movie with and still have the adult humor that they won't understand.",1494633600,4,1478,3.8300653594771243
4569151,4,B0054K8JSG,"This is a UK economy boxed set of 4 BD's with all four features, each in their own flimsy but nice enough BD case suitable for the shelf. The BDs play fine in US Blu-ray players, though they are bare-bones issues, just the features, with subtitles in 10 languages, but NO extras or even bookmark capability. If you don't mind having to re-start the disk and re-navigate to your chapter every time you take a break, it's a fine bargain. And Disney's extras are usually an embarrassing waste of time, anyway.",1494028800,7,506,4.571428571428571

It is a cheap way to get all the movies. It is all four movies with separate bluray cases for each and a box to hold them together in. I highly recommend this product if it's the Bluray (not multiformat). You really don't need the box because each movie is separate in it's own bluray case. My mom loves these movies. I'll be buying another one. Get the bluray not the multiformat, not only that but the Ultraviolet would probably be expired by now anyway. I think it's time Amazon lists things separately. Because the multiformat these negative review are for is not the same as the Bluray I highly recommend and got.

Which of course is AOK but the problem is that many BluRay players are region coded.  I have three players (2 Sony and 1 XBOX One) and none of them would load these discs.  As such I had to return this because it just would not run, period.  So I suggest purchasing at your own risk.  The product description does say that this is for Region A1/B2 but I did not find that to be true.  I have dozens of BluRays and this is the only one I have ever had that problem with.  And if the region lock is not the issue then I was sent multiple bad discs which is just as bad.  Good luck!",1460678400,2,691,4.014705882352941

4569642,5,B0054K8JSG,"The first three movies were very entertaining and remain some of my wife and I's favorites.  The fourth is the fourth and aside from the impressive effects, the plot is weak and is easily forgotten.  In terms of AV quality, the whole set is very impressive.  From the 3D-style menus to the deep colors I have been very impressed.  They appear to be reference quality on my 110"" fixed frame screen and the audio, while not 7.1+ still delivers the action and the dialogue in the way it was intended.  We own all four DVD's and are happy with the new Blu-Ray purchases.  As a side note, keep an eye out for deals on these box sets...With a 5th movie coming out in the future this will likely drop in price.",1428019200,,703,4.32824427480916

The studio was freaked out by his acting style in the handling of captain Jack.  When I am about to get fired I kind of check out.... ya know.  Quit trying so hard and emotionally distancing myself from the job and the people.  I am pretty sensitive and I love everyone so much it's a survival thing.  But not JD, he kept right on acting his little heart out...I admire that.  but then I admire pretty much everyone so don't let that be the deciding factor in this purchase decision.  Great flick great pirates great job Johnny.

I broke all the discs in half and sharpened them down to a fine point and the long width of the disc-blade is great for getting around those nasty fat parts of the meat you don't want!

If there was a way to return it and get my money back, or exchange it for a set that was not broken I would pay shipping costs.

It also has a cheap paper cardboard like thing on it and it really made me upset about that because I thought it'd be like the nice Dark Knight Trilogy box set but it wasn't, which IS really saddening. It shows me that Disney doesn't care too much about their customers because if they did, they'd give us something worth putting our money into.

There is only a DVD of the 4th movie. I hate it when they use technicalities like that.

4569882,2,B0054K8JSG,"It seems most reviews for movie box sets don't review the movies themselves, but how they're presented in the actual set. This will be another one of those reviews, however I will quickly say what I think about the movies: Curse of the Black Pearl, 4 stars. Dead Mans Chest, 3 stars. At Worlds End, 4 stars. On Stranger Tides, 4 stars. They're all fun movies, and even slightly confusing the first time you watch them, but that still doesn't mean the music and visuals are any less awesome.

As for the box set itself (the Quadrilogy, not the chest), it's given me another reason to be annoyed with Disney. When I buy a box set, especially when it's in Blu-ray, I don't expect there to be ridiculous ""previews"" telling me what was in theaters 3 years ago. I want to be able to put the movie in, push play, wait for the Blu-ray loading to pass, and get to watching the movie. For some reason, these discs take longer than most to load.

The first two and fourth movies had at last 4 previews I had to skip, while the third had literally 5 minutes of loading, then a talking skull, then some other Disney stuff that wasted even more time, and then finally the film. The third was the most difficult to actually start.

The set itself is presented pretty well and doesn't feel completely thrown together, but it's still annoying knowing that 10 or 20 years from now when I show my kids the antique movies I had to watch when I was younger is going to these old previews. Of all the box sets I've bought (the Batman trilogy and Lord of the Rings trilogy are some better examples), none of them have previews; they get straight to the movie and off you go. I wish Disney would figure this out, and I wish they would stop showing off Peter Pan in their ""Now on Blu-Ray"" garbage that everybody has seen a million times.",1360368000,11,1812,4.355029585798817

Each of these are blu-ray discs, and you get a digital copy. That alone without the chest, collectors case, and the tons of other discs it comes with would be way more than what they're charging if you went and bought all 4 blu-ray films for $20 each at Walmart.

I think that this is one of the best movies ever made.  It is full of action and adventure.  The visual effects are great, the sound is great, the acting is great, everything is great!  This movie is a classic and it is a must see.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - 5/5:

This is my favourite film in the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise.  It is very well written, the story flows very well.  My favourite part of this film is the settings.  The beaches are beautiful! This movie is also a must see.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End - 4.5/5:

I really like this movie. My only problem with it is that it is too long.  The stoy does flow and the actors are brilliant.  Great movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - 5/5:

Critics gave this film very harsh reviews.  Don't listen to them!  They know nothing!  This movie is funny, full of action and adventure and is overall brilliant.  I liked it so much that I saw it in the theatre four times! They have some new characters and some old ones too.  I really like this movie.

4569899,5,B0054K8JSG,"This is honestly quite the collection, not only does it include all 4 of the (current) Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but also working iTunes Digital Copy codes for mobile device use.

For the price of admission you are getting a set of decent Blu-ray transfers of the original Pirates films, admittedly the quality of the Blu-ray experience increases as you go up in movies while the quality of the movies themselves (acting/plot) fall but you can easily find a happy medium in the process.

Now the presentation of the collection is where I was actually taken by surprise.  This isn't one of those cheap 'lets make a box out of paper and make it look like something it isn't' Blu-ray collections that we've all see and probably own. The Chest of Davy Jones in which this collection is stored is a hard impact plastic box with a rather impressive level of detail, a respectable interior lining, and magnetic clasps to keep the entire closed when not in use.

The disk's themselves come in an accordion file cardboard holder shaped like a piece of Aztec Gold (see the first Pirates movie.) which is respectably constructed, however, like many I don't feel that this design will provide ideal protection for the discs over the long haul as there is considerable movement inside the individual slots.

Closing this out there is a rolled map circa Pirates 3 which is a small scale, non-moving, reproduction of that which you see in the film...this is actually just set inside the box with the disc holder and to me feels like the lowest quality part of the entire package.  It truly feels like an afterthought added in for perceived value.

To those who know this series, you are getting 1080p editions with an impressive audio uptick from the normal DVD previously released.  All movies are respectably done and have deep and rich blacks by default and bright colors without that odd over saturation that many Blu-ray collections tend to have.

To those who don't know the series, the movies themselves are worthy of watching.  Though perhaps billed a little bit towards family and younger children at times, I personally feel there are many nuances of the movies that are obviously directed to adults and more mature humor.  It is most certainly worthy of a purchase if you have kids or not.  I can't say much more about them without having spoilers, which I won't do, but I doubt you will be disappointed at all in any but perhaps the 4th movie which does indeed feel like a last ditch effort by Disney to cash in one more time on the popularity for the series.",1355184000,,2563,4.6837416481069045

4569915,5,B0054K8JSG,"I won't get overly technical, as many reviews already have.

I will simply say for the money, and what is included, this was a great deal.

While the ""coin"" holding the Blue Rays is indeed simply made of cardboard, I have to ask how many times you plan on taking the discs in and out of it, as it would need to be a lot for the disc to be affected by it. If I was purchasing these for children (who tend to watch movies over and over), I might consider storing the actual discs in something else, as I imagine this sleeve contraption would be a mess in no time. I find storing the kids movies in a CD or DVD Storage wallet the best route, as the good ones tend have soft material, and are easily usable by children.

I also think the chest is a nice ornament to have on the shelf, and it makes for a fun reply when someone asks you what it is.",1328745600,,843,3.9763313609467454

4569921,4,B0054K8JSG,"You've got to hand it to Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. They are a winning team of writers with a pretty good resume of flicks that they've combined on. They did the first three Pirates movies and are together again for 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Some of the key characters from the predecessors are gone and some are are back in Stranger Tides...while director Gore Verbinski is out and Rob Marshall is in. Together the cast and crew still manage to keep the franchise alive and entertaining

The special effects are great. The movies are visually spectacular with realistic looking at-sea adventure featuring legendary pirates, ghosts, sea monsters and now mermaids...I'd say the amazing effects actually contribute a full star to all of the Pirates movies in this series. There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character persona inspiration...and by now everyone knows who notice who plays Captain Teague, right?). And all the silliness mostly works. After all, this is Disney and indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?

I find it amazing that On Stranger Tides alone has grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars according to Box Office Mojo). It's a good movie that kids can watch too so that's certainly a recipe for success. But a billion dollars?!? Wow. On Stranger Tides, At World's End and Dead Man's Chest are more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise. So bottom line: all four movies offer like 9 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids.

No, this franchise's ship has not sailed...yet. It continues to please audiences and of course carries an ending that suggests that it has at least one more life left in it. Hence, my recommendation: Add the Pirates series to your cart (and hope that it doesn't take another 4 years for the next installment).",1323648000,,2216,4.857142857142857

1st off the chest while the craftsmanship is excellent (way better than the cardboard version they released with a dvd box set a whole ago) the damn thing is top heavy meaning if you accidentally open the chest all the way without the discs in it than it will tip over! Fortunately the hinges can let you open it any angle but those hinges won't last forever sooner or later your going to have to hold it open while you like a ninja grab the discs out without the damn thing tipping :P

2nd the discs when I 1st seen this I thought it was going to be a cool plastic holder that holds all the discs neat and tidy...boy was I wrong. The damn thing is 100% cardboard and to get the discs out you have to open it up like a fan and grab the discs out. Although it works fine for the discs in the middle however try getting the discs at the front of back and you will have difficulties!

4569929,4,B0054K8JSG,"Hi all, bottom line, if you havn't bought ANY of the films yet, then this is a good deal. You get all 4 movies (including, digtal copies and the 3D version of the 4th film) for $92 (or $23 a movie). So that is a fair price. Alas the Collector's Treasure Chest is a big disappointment. Poor detail & art work; they don't use the space inside the chest to spead the disc out for easy viewing. The copy of the World Map is flimsy & requires very good eye sight or a magnifying glass to read.
  So for someone like me who already owned the first 3 films on Blu-ray, this turned out to be a bad purchase, especially considering the fourth film was not up to par with the previous trilogy.
  To recap  >>> don't own any yet, go ahead & buy the set.  Do have the previous movies  >> just by the remaining films individually.",1320019200,40,817,4.132911392405063

4569931,2,B0054K8JSG,"I'm not going to bother with the movie, everyone buying this has seen the movie and made their own choices.

The packaging on this is the selling point. It's the reason I bought the set as well.

The chest itself is nice, it's a hard plastic and looks like it'll probably last a long time. Being that it's Pirate movies the chest is a nice touch.

The case for the actual discs leaves much more to be desired. It's paper and flimsy plastic with some velcro tabs. If it were a hard plastic case, with tabs for holding the discs it would be so much nicer.

The map itself is pretty lame. None of the rings move, there's just some raised edges where the rings obviously would've moved on a more realistic version of the map.

overall the outer package was nice, but once you open the chest it's kind of disappointing.

We also had a problem with digital codes for the movies, we got 2 codes for 1 movie, but no code for 1 of them. We had to contact the company responsible for the digital codes via their website explaining the situation and request a code for the 4th movie. They did respond within a couple of hours, with no hassle and provided a working code for the 4th movie.",1319760000,9,1177,4.2792792792792795
4569932,1,B0054K8JSG,"This review is about this specific product, not the movies...

The packaging is the absolute worst I've ever seen for a DVD or a Bluray. They're all thrown together in a little cardboard bangle that's never going to hold up with any handling. It's impossible to get them out without touching the playing surface, usually of several of the discs at once.

Then there's the annoyance factor of the Bluray/DVD ""features"". You have to chapter skip through 8 previews and commercials to get to a menu, you can't just press menu. The menu you get to has two options, ""Main Menu"" or ""Play"". Press ""Main Menu"" and you get a talking skull that talks at you for a couple of minutes before actually getting to the Main Menu - why not just always go to the main menu? Then there's the usual 30 seconds of logos, warnings, and disclaimers.

And if that wasn't all bad enough, there's no way to bookmark the Bluray's, and they don't automatically resume from where you shut them down at. So be prepared to watch the whole movie or search for where you left off - after spending four minutes skipping the junk, navigating the menus, and sitting through the disclaimers again before you can even get to a point where you can search for where you were.

The studios just keep proving that Bluray is great for video and audio, but they are a huge step backward in usability and convenience, especially when they're designed like these are.",1319760000,312,1421,4.582677165354331

I would defiantly not buy this item for small children who are careless considering the construction of the coin. The packaging and chest is very small but is still cute and a nice item for collectors or people who just enjoy the movies. The box was nice and very eye catching, and the shipping packaging was great! If the coin was made out of metal or plastic I would have defiantly gave this a 5-star rating.

I realize it's a collectible, but if you actually want to...I don't know...WATCH THE MOVIES, then you're going to find it about ten times more difficult than if they'd provided jewelcases.

Oh, and Disney? Stop devoting a disc to the digital copies! It's a environmental waste. I use these discs exactly once, then keep them in a collectible case forever? Get with the program and just let us download the same way I do with a lot of other films now.",1318896000,39,657,4.475

The chest on the other hand is quite durable and made from heavy plastic.",1318896000,77,402,4.0375
4569937,3,B0054K8JSG,"I just received this product, the chest is ok... but by the picture of the item listing I was thinking you get a round plastic holder replica of the skull coin, you don't, it's just a a paper skull coin wrapper holding the numerous discs in place. Honestly if I'd known that I would have just bought them separately and saved a little money. The little scroll map is also quite cheap as well... looking at the chest up close, it too is quite cheaply made with sloppy painting, they didn't even paint consistently over the metal pins holding the chest together.

More on the ""coin"" holder... it's basically paper with velcro snaps holding it shut. I'll post pictures later, not in the mood since this turns out to be a bit of a downer. It is a fan style index card type holder and it's kind of hard to find where to slide the discs back into...

I'll review the movies later, as for quality etc. Mainly I've rated this 3 stars for the ""special limited edition"" packaging which for me, turns out to be a bit on the unworthy side despite the price drop. It seems the main worth is the plastic treasure chest and the digital copies which are actually standard in most deluxe Blu-ray/dvd combos. So, I'd only suggest buying this if you want a cheaply painted plastic treasure chest.

Printing RETURN labels, I got to At Worlds End and got an error 3 times trying to download the digital copy, I handled the disc with kid gloves, but it was already scratched, i finally noticed a tiny straight scratch... that does it for me, have to return it.

In the end it's far too troubling to replace just one disc, you have to return the entire product and it's just not worth the trouble.",1318896000,229,1674,4.407766990291262
