8422373,1,B004BV87LI,This movie is remarkable for complete absence of talent or ability on the party of anyone concerned. It is a cheap no-name not-even-grade-B boring waste of time. The director has no concept that there is an art and craft to making films and couldn't stage a scene if his life depended on it. I found it impossible to take any interest whatsoever and threw my copy in the garbage rather than allow it to waste further time for another person.,1492387200,,441,4.525
