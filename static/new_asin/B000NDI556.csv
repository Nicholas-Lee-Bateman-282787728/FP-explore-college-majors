8177317,5,B000NDI556,A must for aviation history buffs. Better than expected!,1480982400,,56,5.333333333333333
8177318,4,B000NDI556,"This DVD of about an hour's length is a treasure trove for Luftwaffe fighter pilot history. In this exposition on Luftwaffe fighter aces, there is lots of excellent film footage and even interviews with several Luftwaffe luminaries.

If you like WWII aviation history, this is a very good resource. The DVD gives you a good rundown of the best of the German WWII fighter pilots - though not necessarily in order of kill scores. It chronicles the careers of some of the highest-scoring German aces with both stills and vintage film clips. There are clips of an interview with Adolf Galland in English from the 1980's as well as parts of interviews with Erich Hartman, Gunther Rall and Walter Krupinski.

There's a lot of good film footage. Yes, there are the usual propaganda clips of successful fighter aces being awarded Knight's Crosses as well as good footage of German aircraft. There's also a lot of gun-camera footage of British, American and Soviet opponents falling to the guns of Luftwaffe aircraft. There's even good footage of American heavy bombers (B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators) taking punishing fire from fighters. There's even a couple of head-on attacks on film I found very interesting.

This is a good DVD and, although the narration and soundtrack are just okay, there's a lot of good information on the German fighter arm of WWII including from the aces themselves.",1477699200,,1399,4.97008547008547
8177319,5,B000NDI556,"Fighter Aces of the Luftwaffe is a fantastic 56 minute, 27 second DVD produced in 1997 featuring archival and newsreel footage, still images, and post-war interviews with Luftwaffe aces including Rall, Hartmann and Galland - oh, and Walter ""Graf Punski"" Krupinski, too (!!) - plus excellent narration. The general tone of the narration is apolitical, or politically-neutral, but it does open with a strong claim on behalf of the Luftwaffe's aces:

""Germany's fighter aces must be credited with outstanding, and often astounding, achievements in the air. With the years now passed, in our current climate of peacetime and political correctness, history should now recognize that the German airman was a brave and fair opponent whose professionalism should be admired by all nationalities and generations of fighter pilots...""

I do wish the documentary was longer, and it's a mild disappointment that the packaging is extremely plain...lousy even. The disc came in a standard single-DVD ""case"" with a strange, almost abstract-art like sleeve printed with an eagle silhouette and what I think is an explosion on it, and ""Fighter Aces of the Luftwaffe"" in plain type at the bottom. You'd think they could've at least used a free-license pic of an Fw-190 or Bf 109 on the cover!

Also, the DVD itself contains no extras (or a navigation menu ever!), is just as boringly printed as the box sleeve, and covers only the single seat day-fighters. But again, the content is very solid and I've watched this several times now...good narration, seemingly accurate script and no obvious errors or inaccuracies or overt political critiques. Note that the interviews with Galland and Hartmann, for example, are conducted in English, whilst Rall (whose English was much less polished than some of his comrades) speaks in German and the narrator ""translates"". The film concludes with some sobering reflections by Rall and Krupinski (who was speaking at age 77).

This could be a great addition to your collection, and I enthusiastically recommend it! Especially appreciated was the surprise coverage of Hans-Ulrich Rudel (11 air-to-air victories, according to the documentary), who I would not have expected to feature in this list - though calling him ""the outstanding combat pilot of all-time"" may ruffle a few feathers! Just don't expect a pretty external package with this DVD documentary (and I'm referring to the version pictured above (as of Jan.'14):  2007 by Eagle Rock Entertainment, Ltd.; DVD-R, 4:3 screen format, dolby digital stereo, NTSC in English).
