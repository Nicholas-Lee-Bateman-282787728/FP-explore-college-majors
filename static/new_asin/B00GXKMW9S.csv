6123760,5,B00GXKMW9S,"I enjoy yoga but because of multiple medical issues I can no longer do many of the stand alone and/or floor positions.  I watch and then participated in several of Sarah Starr's shows during a recent ""staycation"".  But I leave for work at 6:30 AM and they were on at 6:00 AM.  I was extremely pleased to find here programs on DVD's.  I purchased three and enjoy them tremendously!!",1431993600,17,381,4.478260869565218
6123761,5,B00GXKMW9S,I love Sarah Starr's Happy Chair Yoga!  I have physical limitations due to cancer and fibromyalgia.  I love that I am able to do standing postures with the aid of a chair.  I have had improvement in flexibility and it also makes me feel so much better emotionally as well.,1427673600,18,272,4.4
6123762,1,B00GXKMW9S,I just didn't like it. I didn't care for the instructor.  The script was ridiculous.,1423440000,3,84,4.6
6123763,4,B00GXKMW9S,"However - my sweetheart has.
She is enjoying it to the very max.
The show keeps the pace where she can keep up.
She likes it quite a bit and we will be purchasing the rest of the series (there is one right?)
as she progresses.",1400630400,16,226,3.9347826086956523

6123776,5,B00GXKMW9S,have knee problem and these posses work great and stretch the muscles great.  sleep great at night when doing this dvd,1482537600,3,118,4.619047619047619
6123777,5,B00GXKMW9S,"I have a number of Sarah's chair yoga videos and this one is just as well-presented as the others.  The poses are gentle stretches, with modifications for more advanced students.  Sarah's guidance allows the student to learn the correct form and breathing for each pose.  The videography is stunning.  All of this makes for a wonderful, unique way to engage in a healthy yoga practice in the comfort of your own home.

As someone who can no longer do 'floor work', I'm sincerely grateful for the availability of these inspiring DVDs.  I highly recommend Sarah's (chair) yoga videos!",1474848000,5,582,4.887755102040816
6123778,5,B00GXKMW9S,Perfect for me as a beginner.  Love it.,1470960000,2,39,3.875

6123780,5,B00GXKMW9S,"which focuses more on the legs, while this one with the sunflowers named Summer Brilliance focuses more on the upper body, so I plan to alternate them.  I love this seated routine so much I hate when it ends, haven't tried the standing yet but I plan to.  I have multiple health issues that make my hip joints stiff and painful, so I can't put one ankle up on the other knee for the pigeon pose.  A modified position I learned in Ann Burnell's program is to just keep one leg straight, cross the other leg over at the ankle, then bend forward, and it will still give a gentle stretch to the hip joint.  I'm glad it doesn't have music, just nature sounds, because I play a wonderful youtube Yellowbrick Zen Music track #655 in the background, and it doubles the health benefits :=)  This is definitely a 10-star yoga routine, there's some confusion at the very beginning I'm glad to have cleared up for me, thank you David!  I'm leaving the original question to go with his response in case anybody else needs to know.  The very first movement starts out tapping the left palm up the inside of the right arm, wrist to shoulder, then tapping back down on the back side.  But when she switches arms, the tapping starts at the shoulder on the inside of the left arm down to the wrist, and back up on the outside.  Is this intentional?  left arm needs different treatment than the right?  or should both be tapped up on the inside, or down on the inside??  I know it really makes a difference energy-flow-wise. Another question I hope to get answered, is there more than one version of the Summer Brilliance routine in the sunflowers?  The one I watched on PBS with the same name had a different ending than the one I bought on amazon, and that ending was the reason I bought it so I was disappointed it wasn't on it.  Thanks for any help from anyone!

Sarah Starr is amazing, she has more repetitions of moves than my other programs, so you stay with one until you can actually feel the effect instead of hurriedly moving on to another after 3 times.  And she explains what each movement is doing inside your body so you can actually focus on that part of your body.  I'm doing 4 different programs of hers now, and expect to keep adding more until I can do a different one every day of the month :-)",1466208000,15,2296,4.352112676056338
6123781,5,B00GXKMW9S,"I came across Happy Yoga on TV by chance one morning while flipping through the channels.  It was an episode from Volume 1 - in the sunflower garden - and was so beautiful and relaxing I ran to Amazon to see if it were available on DVD.  I'm so glad it was!  I'm new to yoga, and wanted something that wasn't labeled for ""Seniors"" that gave me some support so I could learn poses and breathing without falling on my nose.  Happy Yoga's Chair Yoga is just perfect for me!  I love having the variety of one seated and one chair-supported episode in each of the five volumes - good value for the money!  Sarah Starr's voice is clear and calming, and the settings are amazing.  The filming is very well done.  I've ordered three so far, and plan to complete my set with the other two volumes soon!",1464912000,12,793,4.275167785234899
