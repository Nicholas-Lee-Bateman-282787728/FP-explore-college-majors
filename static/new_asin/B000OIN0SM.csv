8185306,4,B000OIN0SM,"I saw ""My Name Is Nobody"" when I was younger and I enjoyed it then as well as now. A bit different from the norm for Henry Fonda. Shot in the spaghetti western semi-comedy style of movie was very entertaining. ""Cain's Cutthroats"" on the other hand was a bit embarrassing to watch. I don't know it that was intentional or not, but I bought the cd for ""My Name Is Nobody"", and that is what the 4 star rating is for.",1397088000,,413,4.111111111111111
