8223465,3,B000WHS7OM,Doesn't cover the split Child (defensive vs free) and Parent (critical vs nurturing) ego states.,1437782400,,96,5.466666666666667
8223466,1,B000WHS7OM,"I bought this after watching some short videos on Transactional Analysis on YouTube [...] assuming that this video went into more depth.  Sadly, this DVD doesn't even cover the same breadth of material.

I'll give away the punch-line from the DVD:  Buy the book ""I'm OK, You're OK"".

My advice:  Watch the TA videos on TheraminTrees channel.",1288656000,,341,4.912280701754386
8223467,2,B000WHS7OM,"I was very interested in learning all about Transactional Analysis, so was pleased when I found a DVD on the subject, hoping to save myself from adding another book to the reading queue.  Unfortunately this DVD didn't save me any time. It's really only a cursory introduction to what the field is about and lacks anything more than a superficial introduction.  While I didn't expect a DVD to contain nearly the same amount of information as a book, I did expect much more than I got.  The animations are nice and make for an interesting time watching it, but the information contained in the 40 minutes or so are probably no more than the first chapter of any good book on the subject.  And, at the $20 price tag, you're better off getting a couple of classic books on the subject.  I can't see myself watching this DVD more than once or twice.

If the only thing you care is about with regards to TA is ""What is TA about?"", then perhaps this DVD would suffice.  However, if you actually want to learn about the field in order to really UNDERSTAND and USE the information, then this DVD is woefully inadequate, and certainly overpriced, in my opinion, for the information it offers.",1255824000,,1182,4.547169811320755
8223468,5,B000WHS7OM,"I have heard about the book ""if your are ok I am ok"" before and I always wanted to read it, but I neve had the chance yet. After I heard about this DVD ""are you ok"" and bought it, I found out how important it is for everyone, it is very easy to understand with the nice examples and strong resurces. I have never known about the three stages of ego and the relationship between the past and the present and more.. I really love it and recommend it to everyone to buy and keep it in your library.",1212192000,,495,3.96
8223469,5,B000WHS7OM,"This DVD is a very easy to understand and grasp what it is being intended to help one on.
I highly recommended to just about anyone.",1210982400,,132,4.115384615384615
8223470,2,B000WHS7OM,"Hi all
good day
This product is for beginners and not for complete or advanced learning of TA.

The product is good,the language is succinct. This will be useful for high school students and serves as a TA for dummies. Life positions, Descriptive Model and how to recognize Ego States with verbal and non verbal cues and how to communicate in a complimentary manner were not described.

Moreover it is more like a cartoon for kids. Had it been real characters it would have served a better purpose. The human touch is missing as TA is all about that.

But I appreciate the author for the pains he has taken as something is better than nothing as to my knowledge there are no other videos on TA.

Thanks

8223471,2,B000WHS7OM,"You would be much better off buying I'm OK, You're OK. They refer to it a few times. If you take away the unhelpful and poor quality animation, and 30 second pauses you would be left with a 10 minutes of semi helpful audio. It would be a much better video if they had actual video of situations and conversations between people. The few interactions between people were helpful to understand the different rolls.",1208736000,,412,4.581081081081081
