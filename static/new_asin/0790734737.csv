109213,4,0790734737,"""Mad City"" focuses on John Travolta as Sam Baily, a museum security guard who loses his job due to budget cuts. Sam pretty much has a normal life, has a wife and kids, etc. Sam decides to talk to his boss Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner) about getting his job back, but Mrs. Banks told Sam time and time again that there was nothing she could do about it. So, in one fell swoop, Sam pulls out a shotgun as a result in getting his job back. Sam not only holds Mrs. Banks hostage, but a group of schoolchildren as well. The film also focuses on Dustin Hoffman as Max Brackett, a local TV news reporter who just so happens to be inside the men's room at the museum and listening in on what is happening in the lobby between Sam and Mrs. Banks. Brackett listens to Sam's story about Sam not meaning for any of this to happen and such. And Brackett decides to give Sam's story a heroic spin as the days go by...and the film goes on from there. I own the DVD of ""Mad City"" and its features were all right. This is sort of a sad film for John Travolta's character because of his position in the film. ""Mad City"". A film that is nothing short of intense. A great film with two great powerhouse actors.",1017100800,,1187,4.165217391304348
109214,4,0790734737,"This is a great movie. Travolta does a superb job of playing a semi-educated yet noble working man who doesn't know how to deal with bad luck. He doesn't even understand that his lay-off isn't his fault and nothing can be done about it. He stumbles into a hostage taking situation and initially is too upset to agree to anything, including immediate surrender.
  Enter Hoffman as a humanist reporter struggling with the conflict of his caring personality with his job of unemotional observer. He has been to the pinnacle, network news, and was found wanting because his emotions got the best of him at a Challenger-like disaster.
  Hoffman's character Max manipulates the situation for maximum personal exposure but at the same time tries to communicate the human story; namely, Travolta's character is a good-hearted but goofy guy who made a mistake and deeply regrets it. Max cares about his subject but he does know how his business operates. His conflict leads him to decide to do good but do it as a grand show.
  In the end we get to see how successful Max was. The message, I think, is (without giving away the ending) when a reporter works with a criminal the outcome is determined at their joining.
  This movie is a great mirror to hold up to news people to say, ""See! This is what you are like. This is why you grate on our nerves so easily"". I hope all news people: TV, print, and radio, learn from it.",997660800,3,1414,4.583333333333333
109215,4,0790734737,"There's no denying that John Travolta's taken his fair share of knocks over the years, the least derserving of which he took upon the release of Mad City.  Not only is his performance not bad, it's one of the finest of his career and hands down his best since Pulp Fiction.  He plays an inept security guard on the short end of a museums down-sizing when he decides to take back his job, at gunpoint if he has to.  This triggers a chain of events the has him taking hostages, children mostly, and becoming the biggest story in network news.  To read this you might not expect to find Travolta's character any too sympathetic but he plays it in such a way that you can't help but feel for him and the dilemma in which he faces.
Dustin Hoffman plays opposite him as Max, a reporter with an unscrupulous past for manipulating the facts to further his career.  But after locking horns with the networks golden boy (Alan Alda), he finds himself stuck at a small time local news station.  His path to redemption with his colleagues, and ultimately himself, comes in the form of Sam Bailey (Travolta).  Sam's misguided attempt at reclaiming his job becomes a TV sensation, comparable to Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing in it's scope.  Max spearheads the frenzied coverage from inside the building as a lucky coincidence has him being taken hostage himself.
With the world watching, Max tries to put a heroic spin on the story but finds himself confronted with a difficult choice.  His career or Sam's life?  And as Max makes his character arch, so too does the audience.  The key to his self actualization is that we're taken along for the ride, following him down that dark road that is network politics.
Comparisons to the 1976 classic Network were inevitable and well founded, but this is a different time and the script is updated to reflect the cynicism that has filtered into all of our lives.  You can almost see Travolta yelling out at the top of his lungs, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!""  He doesn't, of course, and it's to the film's benefit.  His quiet, subtle mannerisms are more telling than any line of dialogue or emotional outburst could ever even think of being.
Ted Levine, you ought to remember him as the serial killer Jamie Gum in The Silence of the Lambs, plays a supporting role as the local sheriff trying to achieve notoriety as being the law enforcement offical who ""handled"" the crisis.  He's perfectly cast, as is every role from the children being taken hostage right down to the ""background artists.""
And those are just a few of the characters acclaimed director Costa Gavras (Z and Missing) dissects in the course of the drama.  He centers the story as much on being a character study as a look at corporate news and how they spoon feed us their version of the truth.  Deftly written, acted and directed the film's flaws are slight and it's deserving of high praise.
Among my few beefs is the inclusion of a moralistic voice in the form of Robert Prosky, whose less convincing and more annoying because of his preachy tone.  That's not to say his performance isn't good or the character isn't necessary to the story, just that it should've been toned down.  Afterall, how many of us really believe he could make it to a producer's status without crossing that ""invisable line"" of ethical integrity along the way?
But aside from that Mad City is a near perfect gem and one of the most underrated movies in a year that provided us with such instant classics as Boogie Nights and L.A. Confidential.",982281600,8,3551,4.6079365079365076
109216,4,0790734737,"Okay so John Travolta made a mistake with Battlefield Earth but does that discredit everything he's done in the past.  Does that make Pulp Fiction any less intense or make his moves in Saturday Night Fever any less fluent?  I'm of the opinion that an actor of John Travolta's caliber can redeem himself and during his brief comeback stint he made one of the best films of his career which went sadly overlooked.  In Mad City he plays a pathetic security guard, a role so inept that you'd think it scare him off but no, he plays it to perfection.  And when he takes his boss and a class of students on a field trip hostage he finds himself under the bright glare of the media's spotlight.  The light's being cast by Max (Dustin Hoffman), an unethical newman whose willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to get the story.  As you might expect, and we all know that it's coming, he and Sam (Travolta) hit it right off and form a friendship that penetrates the politics of television news.  So it's up to Max to put a heroic spin on the story and save his newfound friend from being sent through the shredder by his cynical collegues. In particular an evil news achor (Alan Alda) intent on destroying Sam's credibility and for all intensive purposes, destroying his life.  Never as a film touched on the subject of jounalism in the hands of ratings grubbing producers with such effectiveness and with Travolta as Sam we can't help but empathize with his plite.  It's a great film with great actors.",971568000,4,1494,4.544776119402985
109237,2,0790734737,"I think this movie depicts how the media blows many incidents way out of proportion. In fact, they will desperately go to great lengths and alter what people said in order to present a more catchy, dramatic news headline. John Travolta portrays a man who lost his job a museum. All he wants is his job back. He brings in a gun to be used as threat but accidently fires it and kills a security guard. He realizes that his whole life is ruined. Meanwhile a reporter tries to portray Travolta as a working class man who was simply trying to provide for his family. He shuold serve some time but then should be granted a second chance. Basically he was trying to portray that not every criminal is evil at hurt. However, the media quickly revamped his story and turned it into a sick twisted, racist pig who is holding kids hostage.

As far as the movie goes, it is rather long and boring. Most of it is slow and dragged out over the 2 hour mark. This movie could have been made into an hour and a half. It starts and ends well but the middle became a bit confusing and can be very disinteresting for the viewer to follow.",1208217600,,1118,4.273584905660377
109238,5,0790734737,"I was truely impressed with the acting of both Dustin Hoffman & John Travolta. You think these men are the people they're portraying here. I honestly can not believe this movie got any bad reviews. I bought mine as a Previously Viewed from a Video Rental Store and then go to Amazon and notice the low prices and think to myself - This is going to be a lousy movie to watch -- Wrong. I watched it from start to finish like reading a good book and can't wait to see how it turns out.
  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie at these low prices. You won't be sorry.",1202688000,,564,4.072072072072072
109239,2,0790734737,"Lord knows the media is a worthy target for social commentary. However, it is also an easy one, and has been often targeted in the past. Thus the central problem with ""Mad City,"" Costa-Gavras' updating of Billy Wilder's ""Ace in the Hole."" The film spends nearly two hours denouncing the media---namely print and television news---for a variety of social ills, for not all of which it can so easily be blamed. And those things it can be blamed for, we kind of already knew.

Nonetheless, an excellent cast works hard to bring off this story of reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman), who `lucks into' an exclusive when a disgruntled, laid-off security guard (John Travolta) takes his former employer and a group of kids hostage in a museum while Brackett just happens to be in the bathroom. Travolta is to be commended for taking on a part that is not particularly sympathetic, in the form of a character that is not very bright. He and Hoffman carry the film as far as it can go, but by the end you are likely to feel that you're being hit over the head with the simplistic central message, such that the tragic coda loses impact. It's not a bad film, and with these talents it can't help but have its moments, but overall it's a bit of a missed shot.",1152403200,,1251,4.511013215859031
109240,5,0790734737,"... he battles against the greatest obstacle an actor can face and almost pulls it off. What's that obstacle? you ask. Well, it's having a script that's so paper thin that it must have been written on toilet paper. Travolta proves over and over again that good scripts are not neceesary to prolong a career in Hollywood.

I once met John Travolta at a charity event in Bel Air. I said to him, ""Hey Travolta, who the heck is your agent and why do you keep taking these cripey roles?"" I give him credit though, he looked back at me very cooly and said, ""I fly airplanes and I'm married to Kelly Preston, you're wearing an enormous sombrero and spandex bike shorts -- who are you to judge me?""

Touche, Senor Travolta. Touche.",1149552000,,723,4.428571428571429
109241,3,0790734737,"Ever since winning a Best Actor Oscar for his role in 1994's PULP FICTION,John Travolta was relentlessly,to this day,making films. This one,was his first post-PF flop. His previous flops include PERFECT,TWO OF A KIND,SHOUT and THE EXPERTS. This film was theatrically released on November 7,1997 and released on video on February 24,1998. In this film,Travolta is a former security guard who takes museum patrons hostage,very similar to what Tim Robbins did in 1990's CADILLAC MAN. Max Brackett(Dustin Hoffman) is a news reporter who covers the situation. Great support from Alan Alda. Travolta's follow-up film PRIMARY COLORS was much more successful than this. Despite the critical and box office disappointment,some of Travolta's fans loved this one.",1111536000,,752,5.547826086956522
109242,4,0790734737,"Apart from the parallels one could draw with Dog Day Afternoon or Network, there is really very little to say about this media clunker. Which is sad because the script had a lot of potential and the production quality is top notch.

The  theme is not altogether incredible in our times -- an embittered employee going berserk and threatening violence. Problem is that Travolta is saddled with the challenge to potray this unwitting hostage-taker, part antagonist and part victim. I'd contend that he failed to bring out this delicate dichotomy.

Even Hoffman's full-blooded newsman with a childish, self-centered ambition and some very sardonic light moments in the earlier half, cannot save the film from its maudlin second half, by which time it's already too late for us to care.

An ok rental perhaps, especially if you're interested in an insider peep into the lives of news networks. But not something I'd watch more than once despite its uncanny ending.",1093046400,,960,5.018867924528302
109243,5,0790734737,"This is a great suspense movie.

109244,4,0790734737,"This satirical movie starts innocently enough, with Dustin Hoffman (Max Brackett) doing a ""controversial"" story on a local criminal.  Brackett has been relegated to small-town duty after embarassing the network star, Kevin Hollander (played brilliantly by Alan Alda).  Sam Baily (Travolta) has been fired after working as a guard at a museum.  He lives paycheck to paycheck and has a family to support.
To get his boss to listen to him, he makes the decision to take a gun with him to capture her attention...a gun and a bag full of dynamite.  The movie is wonderful, not for the twists and turns, but for the performances and nuances.  A number of times, Brackett could take a risk and end the situation, a situation he basically created himself out of his own greed.  In the end, this movie has great commentary on how the media goes overboard in its coverage.  This movie may be more relevant today than when it was made.",1077494400,7,924,4.701863354037267
109245,5,0790734737,"It epitomizes the media circus following the armed hold up of a museum with children. Certainly a comical look at terror attacks is a much needed relief in this day and age of color coded alerts. Costa Gavras of ""Missing"" fame sugar coats the ordeal with satirical portrayal of liberal and conservative neonazis fishing in troubled waters; while extracting a remarkable performance from Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta.",1031875200,3,420,5.1911764705882355
109246,5,0790734737,"This was a good movie, and I don't want to ruin the ending because it should be a surprise, as I was. It's about a guy(Travolta) working on low wage, as a security guard at a church. He gets fired! So, he can't get Ms. Banks to listen to him. So, he comes in with a gun and a bag(you'll find out what's in it!) He's surprised to find a class and a teacher on tour there. A media guy(Dustin Hoffman) is in the bathroom reporting to a girl outside. He thinks Sam(Travolta) is taking hostages, but Sam's not. Sam goes to get his job back. Ms. Banks still doesn't listen to him. Sam shoots and accidentally hits his good friend, the other security guard for the church. Which gets the media even more involved. Things keep on packing up until the end, where the girl switches to the story, and Max(Hoffman) realizes the truth. Great story, startling suspense, so WATCH THIS!!!!",1019260800,4,873,4.395061728395062
7791370,1,0790734737,Boring and stupid.  The only good part was looking at the pretty little intern.  Travolta was awful with his attempt to play a low IQ dolt.  And then why would Alan Alda want to destroy Travolta?  Made no sense.,1517529600,,211,4.333333333333333
7791371,1,0790734737,"Costa-Gavras must not have spent much time in America because the depiction of Americans feeling sympathy for a hostage-taker due to the media's portrayal does not gel with reality. America has one of the most vengeful criminal systems on the planet thanks to William Jefferson and W. Bush, and people reflexively support it; it's merely a reflection of the American attitude towards retribution. I didn't buy it for a minute, and it's difficult to feel any sympathy towards John Travolta's inept portrayal of an 80-IQ (and that's being generous) every-man that brings dynamite to a museum and expects to just walk away scot-free.

The 'power of media' angle here is better depicted by these movies: ""Ace In The Hole"" (a reporter creates the news to milk a tragedy) and Network (tapping into the everyman's id with syndicated vitriol... and that's only half the story).",1499731200,,869,5.034722222222222

Whatever, you can enjoy this film for the acting alone with Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Alan Alda, Robert Prosky, Mia Kirschner and Ted Levine. These actors, and some good dialog, make the film move along at a good clip despite the absence of much happening on screen.

The story gets you involved and reminds me of the famous 70s film, ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" in which much of the film takes place in a bank. Here, it's a museum, and a man is in a predicament something like Al Pacino was in that film except Travolta's character here is totally innocent.
