1938353,5,B0000INU6I,"My son is 3.5 yrs old and we just bought this DVD for him.  He and our 2 y/o daughter love to watch it.  But the amazing thing is that after only one week, my son knows all the letter sounds and can tell them to you on demand all mixed up.  And, my 2/yo likes to repeat the sounds after my son when we sing a song w/ them.  There's only about 3 sounds she has trouble making, other than that, she's learning and doesn't even know it!
Highly, highly recommend this DVD.  I actually had four friends last night say that have to buy this DVD for their 4.5 & 5-y/o kids after hearing my son do all his letter sounds for them!",1080259200,,621,3.936
1938354,5,B0000INU6I,"Not only does this entertain my four kids (ages 22 months to 6 1/2 years), it reviews old knowledge for the older ones and helps instill it for the little two.  We mostly got it for our 3-year old, and were stunned when our little toddler proved herself able to say the sounds for all the letters on demand!  Our kids now go around pretending to be letters.  The 3-year old now knows the letter sounds and can blend words together for the first time ever--he'll be starting to read ""Bob Books"" in a few months!  Part of the DVD's effectiveness comes from the way it manages to hit four of Gardner's multiple intelligences.  As a public school teacher and as a homeschooling dad, I heartily recommend this program, as well as the first volume, ""Letter Factory.""  I wish there were a volume 3!",1076803200,6,791,4.458333333333333
1938355,4,B0000INU6I,"other the annoying voices, i actually enjoy seeing my boys watching this video, it is a keeper!",1075939200,,95,4.647058823529412
1938356,4,B0000INU6I,"""Santa"" delivered this DVD to my son at age 2 3/4...HE LOVES IT!!! Will actually ask to watch it over Disney movies and even Thomas the Tank Engine!  We catch him sounding out the letters along with the DVD!  It's great that it's just long enough to keep his attention for the duration of the story (he's very physical and active).  A MUST-HAVE for preschoolers and kids learning their alphabet and phonics!",1075852800,,407,4.625
1938357,5,B0000INU6I,"After reading some of the reviews, I went to a local retail store and picked this up. I watched it with my 2-1/2 year old once, and she was glued to the screen for the entire movie.  When it ended, she asked to see it again.
During the second viewing, she started to sing some of the songs, and was starting to call out the letters and spelling the words with Tad.
I had been working the alphabet with her for several weeks, but she was having some problems with recognition on ""K"", ""X"", ""C"", and ""Q"".  After watching this DVD with her, she's now able to recite the entire alphabet with no problem, she can spell simple three-letter words (Hat, Cat, Dad, etc.) and recognizes all the upper case letters.
The money spent for this half hour DVD does seem high, but the educational value of it is well worth the money in my book.",1075680000,,826,4.288461538461538
1938358,5,B0000INU6I,"My daughter was given the Talking Words Factory for Christmas.  She is only 3 and was very into it.  She watched it day after day.  I then saw the Letter Factory and she was hooked on it as well.
After about three weeks watching both she is now saying the entire alphabet and telling us what the letters sound like.  She is also writing certain letters on paper for us to see.
I highly recommed this to any parent.  It's great.  I hope they soon come out with flash cards for the kids like the ones they are using the the movie.",1074038400,,528,4.127450980392157
1938359,5,B0000INU6I,"After learning their letters and phonics in less than 2 days from watching the Letter Factory video, I decided to go out and buy the Word Factory video for my boys (just turned 3 & 4).  You cannot beat the price, Walmart and Target had the DVD for just $9.99!  Both of the boys love this video too, especially my 4 year old.  He has learned all about the vowels A,E,I,O,U and how they stick the words together like glue.  It's got very catchy tunes and lots of colors to keep thier attention.  They have no idea they are learning how to read, just that they are watching TV!  I am so impressed with both of the videos (Letter and Word Factory) I just hope Leap Frog continues to make more with the same great quality.  At the beginning of the Word Factory, Tad is playing with his Dad with Leap Frog Letter Flash Cards, I REALLY hope to see them in stores soon, my son asks me for them EVERY time we watch the video.  Everyone must go buy both of the videos, the price is great and the investment is priceless!",1072396800,7,1010,4.196891191709844
1938360,4,B0000INU6I,"My kids love this tape! I'm pleased with it's educational value. However, I think kids (at this age) are going to need to watch it repeatedly before much of the content sinks in. The whole word factory theme reminded me of Willy Wonkas' chocolate factory minus the fun realism. This cartoon is typical of Saturday morning cheesy animation. My kids certainly don't seem to care in the least. The story line focuses on Tad wanting to fill out a form to nominate his Dad as the best and he needs to learn how to spell the words he wishes to put on his form. The words that are covered are almost all basic and ryhming three letter ones. Words ending in ""at"", ""in"", ""ig"", ""an"", and ""ad"". Also, ""st"" is illustrated in ""stop"" and then in ""best"". Vowels are named and described as ""sticky"" letters which are the ""glue"" to hold other letters together to make words. I'm disappointed in the shallow and ""un""-catchy jingles throughout the story line. A few well written lyrics with catchy jingles could have made this tape so much more enjoyable and memorable. My kids strong interest in this tape did make me go buy The Letter Factory. I like that these tapes are only 35 minutes long, it helps with (time) limit setting for TV viewing.",1071273600,72,1227,4.531531531531532

1938437,5,B0000INU6I,"I love this DVD! It seems to really engage my 4 year old. Her attention span is not always the greatest (like any 4yo) and we are trying to get her to start putting together her letter sounds (which she made great progress with the Leapfrog letter video). This video has been the best able to hold her attention - and we have tried a bunch of competing products. She pays attention and is making great progress. Even at this age, she is very suspicious of 'learning' videos. This video is not boring, holds her attention, and she is learning. Exactly what I was hoping for!  She asks to have it almost every time we get in the car.",1470873600,,631,4.302521008403361

He absolutely loves them and they are something I won't go crazy listening to. The Leap Frog videos are fun and educational that are easy for toddlers to following along with. This specific DVD should be viewed after the child knows their alphabet, as the focus is putting the letters and sounds together to make words. The characters are engaging yet relatable to kids.

After one viewing, while my son and I were reading, he started showing interest in the words and the sounds the letters made. He now asks to watch it every night and is totally engrossed.",1465171200,,673,4.647058823529412

I played this movie in the car for longer trips out and about and a few days later he was looking at my husbands shirt and started shounding out the letters of the word inscribed on it. So amazing!! He asks for the movie and has seen it about 50 times but doesn't get sick of it. The songs are cute and catchy and help me to help him later on. Definitely one of my best ""electronics"" purchases.",1460246400,4,543,4.132075471698113
1938473,5,B0000INU6I,"My daughter learned her letters and their sounds at 1.5 years using the Leapfrog Letter Factory.  I struggled to find something as a next step between letters and reading, that was age-appropriate for her.

My son is speech delayed after undiagnosed hearing issues (now resolved) and his language learning style appears to be repetition, so he watches videos endlessly until he has them memorized, at which point he practices speaking along with the video.

So seriously, we had all four of our kids reading before they were three.  We used alphabet/phonetic flashcards that had ""B banana"" letter and picture. Then we added ""Bob Books"" and the ""Leap Pad.""

I am telling you that we had just as much fun with the Leap stuff as the kids did! Oh man! I just realized that I gave it to my brother for my nephews! Dang it!!! My four kids are grown, pretty much.  We home schooled through elementary and they soared from there.  The two oldest graduated a year early and the two youngest are two years ahead.  Home schooling is pretty cheap and easy with today's technology.

The Leap system is extremely worth every penny! It is an amazing investment! It is super fun for everyone, including the adults since we didn't have anything that cool when we were kids.  I have to buy another one for my grandson.  i will definitely be getting it from Amazon because I can always find the best deal on Amazon.

1938769,5,B0000INU6I,"After viewing The Letter Factory on Youtube, I decided it was not for my two-year-old. I did look at the other Leap Frog movies the Math Circus, and Talking Word Factory dvd's, and  read the reviews on Amazon. The reviews were so compelling I was convinced and purchased both The Talking Word Factory and Math Circus. I did not purchase The Letter Factory because my daughter already knows her alphabets and their sounds. After watching these dvd's, my daughter now asks to watch them over and over. I like to content and believe it is spot on in teaching phonics to children. I am attempting to teach her how to read and hope these dvd's along with the Alpha Phonics program will help. It is too early to state if she has learned anything, but I am confident she will.  I would recommend this product to any parent looking to teach their children how to read.",1402358400,,860,4.506410256410256

The Talking Words Factory keeps him interested through the whole video because of the catchy songs and the rhyming of words. My son has learned a lot from this particular video. He will ask me all of the time ""mom, what word rhymes with cat?"" He even uses some of the sentences and changes them by saying ""my mom is the best mom in the whole wide world!"" I love it! Great video once again by Leap Frog. I just ordered the Let's Go To School Leap Frog video because my son just started preschool a few weeks ago and I am hoping he can learn a few things from that one too.

This video is a very good ""next step"" to the ""Alphabet Factory"" video. In that video they do a great job of focusing on the sounds that each of the letters make. Still my favorite video in the series. In ""Talking Words Factory"" that literally take what was taught/learned in the ""Alphabet Factory"" and apply it to small words of 3-5 letters (most 3 letters). They will sound out each letter in a word and then make those sounds together which forms the word.

They also touch on rhyming and letter blends like ""dr-i-p"",""st-o-p"" and ""b-e-st"", etc but the majority of the video is about three letter words and rhyming sounds like b-a-t and c-a-t, etc.",1388361600,3,847,4.458064516129032

By four years of age they were reading on a third to fourth grade level, totally self taught.  These DVD's are fantastic.

1938903,3,B0000INU6I,I have several Leap Frog DVDs that I think are done really well. This video Talking Words Factory could be better if the words were made with lowercase letters. I have been teaching Kindergarten for 18 years. I know how difficult it is to break bad habits like writing your name or words in all uppercase letters. The premise of the video and how the words are taught is done well except that the words are made in all uppercase letters.

- shows how vowels are ""the glue that make the letters stick together""

1939045,4,B0000INU6I,Great for learning sight words. Kept my 4 year old son's interest and he asked me questions about the words during the DVD. I still think the storyline in Talking Words Factory and Learn to Read at the Story Book Factory take up too much time. There could be more time allotted for learning. Letter Factory is terrific. My son is ready for sight words and reading now.,1361491200,,368,4.426470588235294
1939056,4,B0000INU6I,"As for reviewers stating that the video is not good because the words are presented in all caps, I didn't like that at first when I saw the cover and read previous reviews. Knowing that, I almost didn't buy the video. Then I decided to just trust the fact that my son is firm in his knowledge of the alphabet and give the video a try.  You know what?  No issues. I presented the word families from the video on index cards for him in lowercase letters and he had no problem discerning the words he saw in all caps into lowercase letters. The point is that I wanted a video to teach my son to decode simple words by sounding them out and this video is helping to accomplish that with the ""sticky"" vowels and the ""Whammer"" machine - all in a fun way. So I'm pleased.

However, I still gave the video four stars instead of five because that was the case for MY son.  A child who is younger, a child who does not have a firm knowledge of lower case letters and their sounds, or a child who has auditory speech processing challenges may not be able to make the same connection my son did and so that means that the video is not effective for everyone.  I think if future Leapfrog word vids are made they should be in lowercase letters. As other reviewers correctly stated, lowercase is how words are presented in books, simple instructions, and other reading materials.",1360800000,8,1364,4.333333333333333

She can sound out any word where the vowels make the sound leap frog teaches in letter factory (the O says ahhh, for instance), and does it all day whenever she sees words or even tries to spell words she is thinking about. She loves the movie, refers to it as 'special letters' to differentiate from the original letter factory, and requests it frequently. I only allow her to watch a video once or twice a week but I feel good about her chosing this one. The songs are cute and catchy, I even find myself singing them at random times, but they aren't annoying.",1360022400,,653,4.360655737704918

When my son was 22 months old he could tell me the letters and their sounds because of this system. We started with the DVDs. Then we added Fridge Phonics. After a couple months I added the Word Builder.  I only let him have about 10 or 12 letters at a time so he doesn't get overwhelmed. When I had too many out, he would knock them to the floor. He's 28 months old now. He doesn't make real words yet.  But that's coming soon!

But watch out for the fridge magnets. Leapfrog changed the sizes. The Word Whammer and the older Phonics with the Frog have the letters that match.  The ones with Scout the Dog and the Sun match the Jet (word builder).",1357516800,,755,4.371428571428571

1939130,5,B0000INU6I,"Leap Frog products are always really good and this DVD is up to their standard.  I think this is a great program for kids who know their letters and the sounds they make. My kids are in preschool and kindergarten and they both love(d) watching the Leap Frog letters and words DVDs...and they really helped them learn their ABCs and sight words.  I can see them forming sounds and memorizing sight words along with the shows and I like how it highlights the sounds of the letters as they are put into words so it helps them learn to transition to sounding out other words too.  My oldest didn't respond well to sight words on flash cards and Talking Words Factory was a nice way to mix it up so we were both less frustrated with learning to read.

My kids learn very differently, but these DVDs have helped them both.  Over the past several years they have watched quite a few of the letter and sight word DVDs from both Preschool Prep and Leap Frog.  Both products are very good, but they are completely different.  Preschool Prep has no story line and the animation is very minimal on white background.  They absolutely work, and they work quickly, but they are insanely annoying for parents and my kids only seem to keep good focus on them if we were in the car or at home for 10-15 minutes instead of the whole show.  The Leap Frog DVDs have a cute story line and the animation is just like a regular DVD so they pay attention a lot better, but with all of the extra stimulation it doesn't seem like they pick as much up as quickly, but it also seems to help them think outside the box a little with the sounds of sight words and not just memorizing the sight words, which is great as they transition from memorizing sight words to actually learning to read.  I guess my point is, if your child needs an immediate focus to help them pick up their letters or memorize sight words quickly, then Preschool Prep might be a better option, but if you aren't in a rush and your child gets bored quickly, then the Leap Frog series is a better fit for you.  If you are like me and you want some strategic focus to get the basics down, some fun to keep them interested, and some time to mix it up...by all means do both.",1329955200,2,2213,4.295673076923077

At the Word Factory they are putting together mainly 3 letter words with similar endings: -at, -et, etc. They also introduce the phenomenon of blends: st (at start or end of word), gl-.  But other than ""at"" and ""et"", a lot of it is very rushed (fast).  What I think would happen is the child will learn the DVD and thereby learn the words rather than participating in sounding the letters and forming the words themselves (well...with the characters on the DVD).  They do other endings, but not many words: -ad, -ig, -op.  They go faster and faster until the machine spoils and need to be fixed.

It's one method to use along with others: printed books with & without pictures for teaching reading; reading to a child; speaking with proper enunciation to a child.

There they learn for example that A+T makes AT. Then they start to build words showing how for example B+AT makes BAT, then CAT, then FAT. It is great.

Although, I personally don't think that the names of letters are as important as sounds (The first words taught don't use names. Example: bat), I am not completely opposed to children learning them as long as the sounds are also taught.

In the Talking Words DVD, children learn to take the next step and blend the sounds into words. This is why I like these DVDs so much and what sets them apart from other programs. Although children could probably easily memorize many easy words at this age, when they encounter more difficult words later one, they will have no idea how to decode them if they are not taught how to break the words down into sounds or chunks. Talking Words shows them how to do this enabling success in reading later on in life.

In closing, I'd like to mention that my two-year-old knows all of her letter sounds and names. She is now working on blending and loves these DVDs.",1283558400,8,1410,5.1798245614035086

1939260,5,B0000INU6I,"I showed this video to my daughter after she quickly learned the letter sound by watching The Letter Factory. At 2 1/2 she enjoys watching the video and singing the songs. She was able to pick-up the ""Letter Factory"" in a week and I think that I expected too much from her at that time that she lose interest in watching this video.

She refused watch the video so I stopped showing it to her for a few months. I continued to show her the Letter factory and other educational videos. The game included on the video where she needs to pick the letter gets her interest back in when she was close to having her 3rd birthday. She now watches this video again and can now read 3 letter word by putting the letter sound together. The only problem was that all Leap Frog video examples are using Capital Letters. She have a letter mat that is all Capital, Blocks that is all Capital and I also write in All caps. So, when I write something, she can easily read the word by sounding all the letters out but then when my wife tries the same word with her she gets confused. This is where we noticed that most toddler toys that shows alphabet only uses capital letters. I guess we continue on what she already know and slowly introduce the lower case letters so she can start learning to read in both cases.

The word game is great! Like what I mentioned, this is what makes her watch the video again. She loves it especially when she gets a clap after choosing the right letter to form the word.

I'm also showing her the other videos such as Talking Words factory 2 - Code Word caper, Learn to Read story book and Math Circus when she request them but this time I will just let her enjoy those videos and not expect her to learn the content right away until she really master this video.",1278892800,,1780,4.275964391691395

1939264,5,B0000INU6I,"Let me begin by saying that I have all the old Leap Frog DVD's.  I didn't purchase this for myself, since I figured that the same title meant the same video.  I did purchase these for friends with preschool age children. As an early childhood and later an elementary school teacher, I have taught many children how to read.  I have also seen many different videos, books, and other materials meant to aid children in the process that learning to read is.  I have to admit that this video series is simply one of the best phonics learning aids I have encountered in all my years teaching.  I recommend these to parents all the time.  These videos are the very best products ever produced by LeapFrog, and that is saying something since many of their toys are good.  The videos are 30 minutes long and targest basic phonics skills that children must master in order to learn how to read.  The running time for these movies is perfect considering the attention span of the children it targets.  The songs used are catchy, and the story lines are fun for most kids. The crowning jewels of the series are the first three phonics videos.

The Letter Factory teaches children the names and sounds of all the letters in the alphabet.  The vowels are only given their short sounds at this point, but that is ok for this level of learning.

The Talking Words Factory teaches children how to put letters and their sounds together to make simple words, mostly with the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern and a few consonant blends.

The Word Caper movie goes on to introduce silent E, long vowel sounds, and vowel-vowel combinations.

The Math Circus video from this series is also good for children learning their numbers and basic addition/subtraction.

Are these videos enough to teach a child to read?  No.  Will they help a child learn concepts faster and easier? Yes.  Is it a good resource for parents who want to help their children have a head start in their reading instruction or who want to help their children who are struggling with basic phonics?  Definitely.

Learning phonics skills early and well is essential for pre-school and school age children.  When a child struggles it must be addressed immediately, otherwise reading gets harder each grade level and students fall further behind until catching up is almost impossible.  These videos help to set a good foundation for children.  Watching the movies with their children and asking them questions based on the videos can also help parents know what their child should be learning and if they are struggling with these skills.

This video series is highly recommended.

PS  REMEMBER - Look at the title of the movies before purchasing.  This is the re-release of the older video series (You don't mess with a great thing!)  If you have the older DVD's in good working order, then you don't need these titles.  LeapFrog has released some newer videos which you might be interested in.

The use of ""st"" is also briefly introduced. I think it's suitable for 2 to 6 years old since the content is not boring for older kids. I recommend it.",1251676800,,492,4.189473684210526

For each letter, the sound of the letter is demonstrated with something funny & easy to remember.  (Example: ""A"", a monster appears and the A's say ""Ah"")  Of course, there is a catching tune enforces the letter & the sound.  There is a little summary after every 4 letters and the video ends with a finale with all the alphabets.

I took time off and got the first 3 Leap Frog DVD's so he *might* still learn something and not go backwards while we regained our desire to teach phonics and learning to read......we took several months off and he watched the DVD's several times per month and the other day I decided to sing the songs like they do (while we were driving in the car) and I'd leave the letter sound blank and let him fill it in  EX: ""The A says____, the A says ____, Every Letter Makes a sound the A says ___""  He could do almost all of them!!!!  I was so surprised and happy!  After all that effort and hard time of trying to teach him all I had to do was pop in a DVD?  Granted not a complete curriculum but it sure gave us a break and a step up with phonics!  THANKS LEAP FROG for making these DVD's.  I have only let him watch the first two I am saving the 3rd one for a little later.  They sure helped us.

The Letter Factory DVD is a great introduction to letters and their corresponding phoenemic sounds. Through the Letter Factory, my toddler child learned the entire alphabet and phonetic sounds in only two weeks.

We purchased the Talking Words Factory at the same time. This film teaches basic reading principles using catchy songs to illustrate word building concepts. There is a song about how vowels are ""sticky, icky letters"", because they are the GLUE (sticky, glue) that hold a word together.

This DVD is just as educational and entertaining as the Letter Factory. For preschoolers, I recommend starting with the Letter Factory film before moving on to this video. Both are a valueable resource.",1176595200,,861,5.049295774647887

When I told her why, she wrote all the information down to pass onto other parents whose children are struggling.

Now, my 2-year old watches them and she only knows a few letters, but she knows almost ALL of her sounds when you ask her.  That is impressive!  After seeing the success with my kids, I bought them for my nieces, one of which was struggling with severe ADHD and classroom difficulty.  She mastered sound and blending concepts that she could not master in the classroom and she now has a great phonetic background.  I know she would not be where she is today if she didn't have these videos.  I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and I highly recommend them to ALL my parents at school.

My youngest just turned 2.  At daycare, one of the speech therapist comes in, and does random testing.  She stopped me in the hall yesterday, and asked me how my 2 year old knew his entire alphabet and their sounds.  I told her from this DVD, and she looked at me like I was crazy.  I told her again, I am serious.  Well I still don't think she believes me.

But another provider that was in that room, and has a daughter that is 3 is going to buy this movie.

This movie teaches children their letters, even their sounds in a way that helps them remember the sounds.  For example, my two year old,  makes the K sound as he kicks things around the house.  I just have to keep reminding him to only kick balls and not my sofa or his shoes.

The only thing I have to complain about is having the songs stuck in my head while I am work... (The A says ahh, the A says aah.. and stick icky letters)  That of course is very, very annoying.",1154908800,2,1182,3.940677966101695

Though my son is just learning his letter sounds via the Letter Factory DVD, he is starting to learn about forming words from watching this video.  My daughter, who is at the stage of learning words, probably gets more from this than he does, but I am convinced that the exposure to word building will not hurt.  I particularly like the loving way all the members of the Frog family interact with each other.  There is no fighting between the siblings (Leap, Lily, and Tad), and the children respect and love their parents.  The ""kids are cool and know more than their parents"" attitude in so many kids movies is thankfully absent from this wonderful DVD.

1939649,5,B0000INU6I,"My son was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified when he was 3. PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.

My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.

While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.

Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get the Talking Words Factory from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.

I am very, very pleased with this DVD! My son watches it quite often, and he's now reading books on his own. I can see a marked difference in a matter of WEEKS. Before, he had to think about how some of the letters sounded. Now, he rattles them off like a pro--as well as 3-letter words!

This DVD also teaches about vowels and consonants, so he's learning how the vowels are sticky like glue, holding words together (thanks to Professor Quigley's Sticky-Ick-O-Rama machine!). The Word Whammer machine shows children how to put the consonants and vowels together, and how they sound. I like the fact that they'll switch around the vowels with the same beginning and ending consonants, to highlight how a vowel sounds within a word.

Talking Words Factory also teaches rhyming, which is a bonus.

Highly recommended!",1138406400,257,1572,5.0

I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to give their kids a head start on reading.,1137888000,,420,4.085365853658536
1939681,5,B0000INU6I,"After so much success with Talking Letters by Leapfrog, we went ahead and bought this one and were just as pleased.  Talking Letters taught recognition of each letter and the sound it makes;  this DVD teaches how to put those sounds together to make simple 3 letter words.

My son was roughly 2.5 when we bought this, and he quickly learned to read 3 letter words.  When my daughter's friends came over, my daughter liked to spell words with letter tiles and have him read them to the genuine amazement of her playmates.

Of course, if you want your child to fluently read a variety of books, it will take more than this Leapfrog series of DVDS (to date there are 4 reading ones and 1 math one).  However, this dvd UNQUESTIONABLY gives kids a head start.  It makes the material fun to learn and easy to remember, and who can quibble with that??

I have also recommended this series to several friends whose kindergarteners were having trouble with letter/sound recognition and the idea of blending letters to make words.  The dvds helped all of their children make significant progress towards mastery of these concepts.

I will warn adults that, while certainly not on a par with Teletubbies or Boo-bah, the DVD can be annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs. But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.

This series, and this dvd in particular, is a great guilt-free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table.",1136764800,6,1502,4.694656488549619
1939682,5,B0000INU6I,"What a creative, fun and intelligent way to teach reading!  This DVD serves many great purposes for us:

1. My 2-yr-old is beginning to get the ""concept"" of reading.  The idea that letters=words=meaning isn't something a 2-yr-old is presented in every-day life.  This DVD gives toddlers the opportunity to grasp this concept (if it interests them) while having fun (if they're not ready to grasp it, they'll just have fun).

2. I'm sure that over the next year or so my toddler will return to this DVD and be VERY excited about his ability to understand it on a new level.  Best of all, he will have reached this new understanding ""all by himself"", the most authentic, inspiring way of learning.

3. I enjoy watching it with him from time to time.  It refreshes my memory of how you learn to read.  I'm now prepared to spontaneously sound things out, point out rhymes and letter blends in a helpful way when my baby asks me to (and, yes, after these DVDs, they WILL ask you to sound things out--even before the age of two!!!)

I'm very impressed with the way LeapFrog makes learning fun and gets them used to combining letters and sounds in a way that helps their comprehension.

Initially, I was afraid that he wouldn't sit through it because he's used to the level of animation produced by Pixar and Disney.  However, I was pleasantly surprised!

He watched it all the way through and then asked if he could watch it again!

My almost 6 year old daughter is starting to want to watch more ""grown up"" videos. Kids in her kindergarten class tell her that Dora, etc are for babies.  Yet she absolutely loves this adorable Tad video (Tad is the main character in the story--it is set in a story format with songs, teaching, etc.). And she will watch it over and over again 3-4x in a row.  And of course there is the excellent educational value.  She now understands the ""silent e"" concept in reading/spelling (ie: ""tame""); and she understands the concept of--""when 2 vowels are together the first one does the talking and the second one does the walking"" (ie: the word ""team"").

I wish they would come out with more math videos. The math songs should go a little slower so that beginners can grasp the adding and subtracting concept a little easier.  However, my daughter understood addition and subtraction since she was 4 years old thanks to the great JUMPSTART kindergarten and 1st grade CD's for the computer--another fabulous resource for your pre-schoolers (my daughter's kindergarten also uses these CD's in her computer class and I am so glad that she was already familiar with them at home).

1939748,5,B0000INU6I,"I have never felt strong enough to actually take the time to write a review.  I am a certified k-6 teacher who has told everyone I know about Leap Frog's 4 amazing movie and now I am telling you...

LF Letter Factory:  This was the first (out of 4) Leap Frog Movie that my children watched.  My 3 1/2 year old and 2 years 2 month old boys are allowed to watch 1 movie a day.  Each Day they agreed, in excitement, to watched this movie.  Under a week my 3 1/2 year old knew his letter sounds. He could sing the letter sound song almost as fast as he could sing the alphabet. After a week, he amazed us when he sat down on the ground and wrote out the entire alphabet like a 4th grader.  Had NO idea he could write like this!  Shortly thereafter, the 2 year old knew all his letter sounds and letter recognition.

Talking Words Factory:  I was so impressed that I bought them the Talking Words Factory that 2nd week.  I wasn't surprised that my 3 1/2 year old began to spell, writing, and sounding out 3 letter words.  He told me all about how the vowels were all sticky and their job was to stick letters together to make words.  He went around singing the vowel song.

My kids loved the videos so much that for 10 months...My son's (who used to play with Thomas the Trains and puppies) were obsessed with letters and words.  They made their own letter and word factory machines out of their toys and tubs, drew each letter cartoon character, and sang the letter and vowel songs, and the older one wrote, yes wrote, many of his own homemade books.

Talking Word Factory 2:  It doesn't stop there...They got the Talking Word Factory 2 and Math Circus when they came out this Christmas. In a couple of days, the now 4 year old, was telling me all about sh, ch, th, and other blends.  He told me how the silent e at the end of the word made the other vowel say its name (long vowel sound).  He went on to tell me also how ""when 2 vowels go walking the first one does the talking."" And he wrote and read new complex words such as, boat, home, dime, wait, etc.  This really increased his ability to read many, many new words - 8 letter words too!

Math Circus:  They loved it too!  Though it is fast moving for beginners, it is entertaining and has an easy concept.  Adding and subtracting now comes pretty easy for my 4 year old.  I gave him a math work sheet for addition and subtraction just for kicks.  Wouldn't you know it, he did all of them with no problem. He was so interested in adding that he started asking about problems such as 3 + 3 + 3.  Which helped him learn the concept of multiplication 3 x 3, 3 x 4, etc.  But, we told him that he had plenty of time to learn that later!

The only negative comments that I have to say about these Leap Frog videos:  Nothing, Oh, except that I wish my children weren't so obsessed with letters!  They eat, breath, and sleep letters.  Sometimes I just wish they would play with the trains, cars, and other toys.  They will have their entire school life to learn about letters and reading!  I just hope that when the time comes for school that they won't have grown board of it!

Other Leap Frog learning tools that reinforce what they learned on the videos:

LF Fridge Phonics Magnets - Love it.  It sings each letters song when you put the letter in the hole.

LF Word Whammer Fridge Phonics Set - LF just came out with this.  I know that they will love.  I bought it for the next birthday!  It is like the Fridge Phonics, but you can spell 3 letter words.

LF Letter Factory Board Game - Love it too!  It is interactive and the board game talks and sings!

LF Sing Along Letters Flash Cards & CD - Songs from the DVDs.  Not that you don't hear the songs sang enough from your children!

Wish they would make computer CD's too!

LF Leap Pad - Fun but they got board with the same books over & over.  $14 a book!

There are many others, but I had to draw the line somewhere!

If you check all the other reviews, I am not alone.  Only two out of 121 people gave this movie less than 5 stars!  It is about time someone made a movie that parents and children both agree on!  Thank you Leap Frog!",1112313600,219,4138,4.159090909090909
1939759,5,B0000INU6I,This video was amazing. My daughter - who isn't even 3 yet - was spelling after watching it!  I would put some letters in the tub for her and she would sound them out - just like they do in the video.  I was shocked!  I would say this is a great one to put in when you don't want your kids to just watch mindless television.,1107820800,,324,3.8059701492537314
1939760,5,B0000INU6I,"I recently bought all three of the DVD's. The first one teaches the sounds of the alphebet which is really cute. My granddaughter, age 5, who is in Kindergarden, knew her ABC's but not her phonics.  Within three weeks of watching these dvd's she is reading short little books and wanting to spell!  These are her favorite dvd's that she requests to watch as soon as she wakes up.  She would wake up in the morning, when spending the night, and start sounding things out and then ask to watch the dvd's.  She is so proud of herself because she is able to sound out words and read.  She is so excited about reading when four months ago, when I moved to be close to her, she hated school and wanted nothing to do with reading because, as she told me, it was too hard.  Now she can't wait to crawl up by me and read the scholastic books I bought for my other granddaughter (whom I am rasing.) The granddaughter I am rasing was reading at age 4 (She was reading to her preschool class and they kids thought she was amazing, she is now in First grade and reading at a Third grade reading level).  Phonics is the best way to begin to teach reading, before sight words, and increase your child's self-esteem and give them a head start so they know what is going on when they get to school.  Lots of praise from the parent also helps to encourage them that it is important.  Leap Frog DVD's are excellent tools, if not the best I have ever used!",1106265600,7,1436,4.25
1939761,5,B0000INU6I,"Excellent, excellent, excellent.. and the ""E says ""Eh"".  My 3 year old knows all the letters, and all their sounds! Its a fun, cute and engaging video.",1100476800,,151,4.592592592592593
1939762,5,B0000INU6I,A friend actually recommended this DVD to us with rave reviews.  We trusted their opinion and bought it.  We've had the video for about 2 months now and my daughter (22 months old) loves watching it over and over again.  She easily learned what the different letters look like and the sounds they make.  I highly recommend this video to any parent.,1095724800,3,348,4.564516129032258
1939763,5,B0000INU6I,"Our 2 1/2 year old grandson watched word factory and began sounding out the ""AT"" words (mat, cat,fat,etc.) before the voice on the video said the word. The videos are top-notch. I would recommend them for young toddlers. The videos are vivid in color and very interactive.",1095120000,,272,4.808510638297872
1939764,5,B0000INU6I,My son who is 3 1/2 loves this DVD the moment he started watching it. He has started reading already and loves the songs. My husband who is very anti-media for teaching thinks this DVD is great and sees the progress that my son has made by watching it. Highly recommended for teaching word and letter sounds and the start to reading for toddlers.,1095033600,2,346,4.421875
1939765,5,B0000INU6I,"My daughter (4) loved ""The Letter Factory"" and immediately requested ""Talking Words Factory"".  After just a few times of watching this video, we pulled out the BOB books and discovered that she was reading!  She knew her vowels, their role in words, and more importantly how to sound out words - one letter at a time, and then 'smash' them together.  This video is a MUST to those of you who love watching the light bulbs come on as children enter into the world of READING.  I've even caught her with pen and paper WRITING the words down as they are displayed on the screen.  BRAVO, to the creative team behind this video.  You and your talents are very much appreciated.",1094601600,5,672,4.512396694214876
1939766,5,B0000INU6I,It's so much fun to watch because the creators took the time to make a story out of learning. I enjoy it because the kids want to do something kind for their father and in the process learn how to make words.,1091836800,,208,3.9761904761904763
1939767,5,B0000INU6I,"We bought this video for our son months ago, and he STILL loves to watch it over anything else he can choose from.  Not only did it help him to learn his alphabet, but he thoroughly enjoyed learning it as well.  He loved this video so much he would walk around all day asking us things like, ""What does the 'A' say?"" with a huge smile on his face when he'd say the letter sounds before us.  When he saw the Words Factory video in the store, he was as excited as we were to get him started on that one as well.  We can't wait to see what Leap Frog videos will follow.  It would be great to see some Leap Frog videos dedicated to learning numbers as well.  *hint, hint*  We hope you all enjoy this video as much as we have.  It's a keeper, without a doubt!  I recommend it for any child.",1080518400,2,785,3.980769230769231

8002282,5,B0000INU6I,"Bought this for my 5 year old who knows all of her letters, all their sounds, but struggles putting them together and breaking them down. In the short time frame we've had this, I've definitely seen an improvement in her interest level in breaking down words. Love leapfrogs ability to make something engaging, and fun in a new way to excite a child to engage in something that thus far they haven't been able to make click.",1523232000,,424,4.51948051948052
