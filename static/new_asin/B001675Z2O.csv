3153545,4,B001675Z2O,"I have to say the Hulk was quite a mixed bag for me.  The plots and acting were complete formula,however it was good to see Bill Bixby play Bruce Banner. Prometheus was the best one of the bunch because it was a showcase of what the series should have been.  The sci fi elements made for a better season.  Especially the episodes with the skinny Hulk in the swamp.  I can't tell you some of these offer lots of unintentional laughs.  This set is the one to get because it offers what the others didn't.  Worthy adversaries for the Hulk.",1212624000,2,536,4.31
3153546,5,B001675Z2O,"i am so glad they finally are bringing back the older tv shows and this show was very cool. The power to go from good to being super strong is very cool. To me all the movies really does not compare to the tv shows. Yes the first movie they came out with stunk this next movie they have coming out looks really good, also a plus when you get season 3 and 4 you get a movie ticket in each box set nice.
well if they have a season 5 i will get it i mean you cant just get one seaon and forget about the rest of the seasons.",1212537600,3,521,3.7027027027027026
3153547,4,B001675Z2O,"After a subpar 1979-1980 season, The Incredible Hulk returned to television in November 1980 after a writer's strike. As the majority of the 18 episodes of the season would show, The Hulk still had plenty left in his tank.  New and inventive storylines were presented, the stars of the show stepped behind the camera as opposed to in front of the camera, and Ol' Greenskin delivered in his first speaking role.  This was to be however, the last hurrah for the big green guy, as the show soon became marred by tragedy and cost cutting.

The season opens with the thrilling two-part action packed episode ""Prometheus.""  David Banner's encounter with a meteor brings out his alter ego. However, Banner finds himself stuck in mid-transformation when he reverts back to his normal(?)self, and the military investigating the creature along with the meteor further complicate matters.  ""Prometheus"" ranks among the best in the all-time episodes of the series and effectively bridges the gap between the first three seasons to the end of the series.

What made season four effective was that the most important episodes centered on Banner and his quest to finally rid himself of the creature, something that season three seemed to lack. This is evident in episodes such as ""Darkside.""  When Banner attempts to supress the emergence of The Hulk, he instead taps into the creature's evil side.  Another episode that reaches into the depths of Banner's subconsciousness is ""Deep Shock.""  When the creature is electrocuted at a power plant, the side effects of the accident have Banner seeing into the future, with  possible fatal results.  The episode at the centermost point of season four is ""The First.""  SPOILER ALERT: This IS the closest that David Banner will EVER come to finding a cure to rid himself of The Hulk. Once Banner thinks he is finally free of the creature, he encounters a man who once had Banner's affliction. Banner discovers that the man is not interested in helping him, but instead longs to have his power back, regardless of the cost.  There would be other episodes after this two-part thriller, but the series in all respects peaked after these episodes.

Series stars Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin directed episodes of the series for the first time during the fourth season. Bixby in ""Bring Me the Head of The Hulk"", another episode dealing with Banner's quest for a cure, and Colvin with ""Goodbye Eddie Cain,"" and the haunting ""East Winds."" All three episodes are solidly done, with Bixby's episode a series standout.

The Incredible Hulk was always great for tearing on the heartstrings of its audience, and season four is no exception. In ""King Of the Beach,"" Lou Ferrigno performs in his first speaking role. The episode is really a showcase for Ferrigno, with Bill Bixby mostly in the background playing a supporting role. While ""King Of the Beach"" is sometimes knocked for its predictable script, the episode is entertaining for its unique photography and touching storyline. In ""The Harder They Fall"", David finds himself adapting to life as a paraplegic.  After some thought, he believes that he can walk again with the emergence of the creature.  One of the most powerful episodes of the series, ""The Harder They Fall"" is a can't miss.

Perhaps the final great episode of The Incredible Hulk is ""Interview With The Hulk.""  When a reporter (not named Magee) traces down Banner and blackmails him into telling his story, Banner agrees. Unbeknownst to Banner, the reporter is from The National Register and Magee is soon on the hunt for both of them.

Oddly enough, it was during the filming of this episode when Bill Bixby (while on the set) learned of his son Christopher's death from a throat infection.  After this episode, ""The Incredible Hulk"" seemed to lose its momentum, and the quality of the show changed drastically for the rest of the season as well as the remainder of its run.  After shooting several less than spectacular episodes in the summer of 1981 that would become the fifth season, The Incredible Hulk was unceremoniously cancelled by CBS due to a slight change in ratings and cost cutting that originally threatened to compromise the quality of season four. More on that when season five comes to DVD.",1207699200,11,4244,4.922861150070126
3153548,5,B001675Z2O,"the best tv from the ,80s and i'd watch it over again.. its worth the money",1207353600,2,75,3.75
3153549,5,B001675Z2O,"It's about time that they put this 1980-81 Season of this show on DVD and I've been dying for it finally come out too, especially since the 4th Season was my favorite season throughout the INCREDIBLE HULK's whole 4-year run on CBS along with the fact that the Hulk's 1980-1981 Season was probably the best season of them all too as well as the most upgraded season of them all even though the Hulk's 4th Season was shorter than the Hulk's 2nd and 3rd Seasons since this season opener was delayed, due to a writers strike that was going on back in the Fall of 1980, but the Hulk's Fourth Season still had some quite significant and touching episodes like ""Free Fall"", ""Dark Side"", ""Deep Shock"",""King Of The Beach"", ""East Winds"", ""The First"", ""The Harder They Fall"", ""Interview With The Hulk"", etc. For instance, in the ""Dark Side"" episode they showed a side of the reclusive David Banner(Bill Bixby)and the Hulk that nobody has ever seen before after an experiment to cure David's serious affliction with the Hulk fails by backfiring.

In the ""Deep Shock"" episode David starts being able to see the future with temporary ESP after surviving a brutal electrocution that nearly killed him. In the ""King Of The Beach"" episode Lou Ferrigno does a dual role as well as Lou's first speaking role on this show with David helping Lou(Carl Molina)out with his body building contest and helping him rebuild his confidence with his disability.

In ""The First"", while David continues searching for a cure to stop his struggling ordeal with the Hulk in this 2-parted episode, David stumbles onto the discovery that there was once an evil creature very similar to the Hulk 30 years ago in a small remote town way before David's infliction with the Hulk even started which results in Jack McGee(Jack Colvin)barking up the wrong tree by assuming that the Hulk(Lou Ferrigno)is responsible for the death of 2 small-town bullies that were actually killed by the evil hulk(Dick Durock).

In addition to what made ""The First"" episode intriguing, while David finally finds a cure to his ailment from the Hulk after years of desperate reasearch, David unintentionally ends up helping a bitter old man named Dell Frye(Harry Townes) relive his days and ability to transform into the evil creature again to avenge the bullies who harrassed and taunted him for so long when Frye comes up with the common-denominator after witnessing David transform into the Hulk after getting beat up in Part 1, which therefore contributes to David being put between a rock & a hard place, which basically puts David in a no-win situation with very little hope left to battling his horrid affliction with curing the Hulk while trying to put an end to Frye's ability to continue his relentless charade as the evil Hulk at the same time while David struggles to attempt saving more people from getting hurt and killed by Frye's creature.

Therefore, David's failure to put a stop to Frye's evil creature and the evil Hulk's destruction of David's antidote to finally putting an end to David's fiasco with the Hulk contributes to David transforming into the Hulk again as usual leading the Hulk and Frye's creature to fight to the finish at the end of Part 2 just before the evil Hulk gets killed off by Sheriff Decker(Billy Green-Bush)when McGee(Jack Colvin) finally discovers he's been barking up the wrong tree all along in this entire episode by assuming that all the killings and incidents caused by Frye's evil creature was the Hulk, especially since nobody really knew about the evil Hulk, but McGee still decides to keep tracking the Hulk and David at the end of this episode since McGee is still convinced that the Hulk is still a major danger to society and still continues to pursue the Hulk with a passion, just like the ornery Col. Decker(Lance LeGault) and his disgruntled predecessor Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking)did with Hannibal, Face, and B.A. on THE A-TEAM for similar reasons.

Additionally, Frye's creature(Dick Durock) ended up stealing the show in ""The First"" episode since they had more scenes with the evil creature in this episode than they did of the Hulk, plus they talked about Frye's creature a lot more in this episode than they did about the Hulk too, especially since Dell Frye(Harry Townes)turned into the evil creature 3 times in this episode, but David only changed into the Hulk twice throughout this entire 2-parted episode. In ""The Harder They Fall"" episode David becomes temporarily crippled after getting run over by a car with McGee still hot on the Hulk's trail as usual, but part of what I couldn't help finding intriguing about McGee pursuing the Hulk in ""The Harder They Fall"" episode was also because McGee had also appeared in the previous episode ""The First"", which basically dealt with 2 Hulks in that episode, which McGee even witnessed for himself.

In the ""Interview With The Hulk"" episode; the recluse David reminisces to a mourning down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter(Michael Conrad)by telling him about his horrific struggling 4-year ordeal with the Hulk and how the insistent McGee has been a thorn at his side & a back-burner for David ever since by using clips from previous episodes from the first 4 seasons for example, kind of like they did in the previous season in the ""Proof Positive"" episode.

The Fourth Season was also the first season to have episodes directed by Jack Colvin as well, since he directed the episodes ""East Winds"" and ""Goodbye Eddie Cain"", even though McGee(Jack Colvin) didn't even appear in those episodes, although it would've been nice and more interesting if McGee had appeared in those episodes as well as directed them, but something else I noticed about this 1980-81 Season of the Hulk was McGee seemed to have started coming out less and less often in this season, since McGee didn't appear in as many episodes in the 4th Season as he did in the first 3 seasons, despite the fact that McGee at least appeared in half the 1980-81 Season episodes, but McGee was unfortunately no where to be found in the Hulks 5th Season with the exception of the ""Triangle"" episode(Original Air-Date 11/13/81) which by the way was the last episode shown before this shows sudden cancellation.

Additionally; the 1980-1981 Season was also the last full season of THE INCREDIBLE HULK throughout its whole 4-year run since CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK on such short notice in the middle of its 5th Season without valid warning in the mid-Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in presidency at CBS.

Therefore, the Hulk's Fourth Season was also the season when the special-effects on this show starting getting too expensive, because of all the fiscal budget cuts we had going on back then due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan got elected president in the Autumn of 1980, which was also why THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 4th Season got off to a late start and didn't have their Fourth Season opener episode until November of 1980 instead of having their Season Premiere for the 1980-81 Season in September or October of 1980 due to a strike that was going on in the Summer of 1980.

It was also interesting seeing some cool guest stars in the 1980-81 Season such as

*Jared Martin in the ""Free Fall"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Bill Lucking in the ""Dark Side"" episode before his co-starring days as the overzealous nemesis(Col. Lynch) on THE A-TEAM and after previously guest starring in ""The Antowuk Horror"" episode from the Hulk's 2nd Season.

*Charles Brill in the ""King Of The Beach"" episode before his co-starring days as the no non-sense Capt. Lipschitz on SILK STALKINGS & after his co-starring days on the short-lived series SUPERTRAIN

*Michael Conrad in the ""Interview With The Hulk"" episode during his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Eddie Barth in the ""Patterns"" episode before his co-starring days as Rick & AJ's retired P.I. buddy (Myron Fowler) on SIMON & SIMON

*Billy Green-Bush guest stars on The Incredible Hulk for the second time in ""The First"" episode after previously guest starring in the ""Wildfires"" episode

*Don Stroud in the ""Danny"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lussen on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET

*Michael Swan in the ""Free Fall"" episode before his co-starring days on AS THE WORLD TURNS & SANTA BARBARA and after previously guest starring in the ""Babalao"" episode in the 3rd Season of the INCREDIBLE HULK, plus this 1980-1981 Season takes me all the way back to memory lane to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president and when the INCREDIBLE HULK was part of CBS's Friday night line-up every week starting with THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM, followed by the DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM, and then DALLAS at 10PM to top that off, which gave me something else to look forward to every Friday, but then the DUKES OF HAZZARD eventually took over the Hulks 8PM time-slot on Friday nights when CBS cancelled this show all of the sudden in mid November of 1981.

Unfortunately CBS had uncerimoniously announced in July of 1981 that they were going to be cancelling the INCREDIBLE HULK when its 5th Season was underway with 7 episodes already in the can which therefore inclined creator(Ken Johnson) to compromise with CBS by at least providing an abbreviated season instead of having a full season or no Fifth Season at all just like NBC ended up doing with the ROCKFORD FILES during its 6th Season when Rockford had abruptly cancelled on short notice back in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner having back and knee problems.

In addition to what led to this shows abrupt cancellation in the mid Fall of 1981 was the president of CBS at the time(Harvey Shepherd)felt that the Hulk was running out of steam plus rumor has it that Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno found it difficult to work with creator(Ken Johnson)and that Johnson was blamed for this show being cancelled because of Johnson and CBS never being able to come up with an agreeable budget to keep running this show. So now that Universal has finally come out with Seasons 3 and 4 on DVD, I don't know what's taking them so long to put the INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season out on DVD, but I hope to see the INCREDIBLE HULK's abbreviated 1981-82 Season come out on DVD soon, especially since the 5th Season was also the last and final season of the INCREDIBLE HULK.

It's just too bad that Universal didn't decide to combine the INCREDIBLE HULK's short-lived Fifth Season onto the Hulk's Fourth Season DVD, especially since the Hulk's 5th Season was only half a season with barely 7 episodes, unlike the first 4 seasons of the INCREDIBLE HULK, but my suspicion on why Universal didn't decide to combine the Hulk's abbreviated Fifth Season to the Hulk's Fourth Season DVD was perhaps due to Universal wanting to get more money out of their customers, especially since Amazon like every other business is seeing quite a decline in sales lately, due to todays humble economy, because of George Bush, Jr's presidency.

Therefore, I initially blame Reagan for THE INCREDIBLE HULK sudden cancellation when it did back in November of 1981 during the middle of its short-lived 5th Season run on CBS, since there was no longer enough money in the budget to keep this show afloat, due to the sluggish economy we had back then during Reagan's presidency.",1206403200,6,11415,4.8311156601842375

""The First"" was my favorite episode, and it's a two-parter that involves David coming in contact with another Hulk, this one sort of a dark-side Hulk that has to be stopped.
Also check out the season premiere, Prometheus, another two-parter, and the ""masquerade party"" episode is pretty funny, with Jack McGee in rare form.
And another cool one is ""Interview with the Hulk,"" where one of McGee's colleages at the National Register follows up on a Hulk sighting and when investigating it, he recognizes David Banner and sets up an interview with him. Then of course, McGee shows up on the scene as well.
Pretty cool season, looking forward to getting Season Five.",1361404800,2,682,4.887931034482759

I can't forget about my man Bixby who does a fabulous job as Dr. David Banner, and when he warns people not to make him mad or just to stop aggreviating him and they don't heed his warnings then he flashes them pretty Hulk eyes I just love it. Some of my other favorites from season 4 would have to be Half Nelson, The First (even though this one terrified me as a child), Danny, Prometheus, Wax Museum and The Harder They Fall. Truly a timeless tv show, and I enjoy sharing this with my 10 year old little boy, who couldn't believe that was actually Ferrigno's own muscles:)",1302825600,,807,4.246753246753247

I rewatched these old shows of the Hulk and found that they are just as interesting now as they were in the '80's. The Hulk is a likable, empathetic creature that feeds the imagination for kids and teaches them about helping others, yet has the excitement of having Dr. Banner turn into the Hulk.

3153607,5,B001675Z2O,"The 4th season of the popular sci-fi/drama, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has to be my favorite. I love the opening 2 hour episode, ""Prometheus"". It's real interesting to see how the meteor (which had a very high level of gamma rays) can affect David's transformation. I felt so bad for David because he was stuck in mid-transformation and there was not one thing he could've done about it (except for get away from the gamma rays). ""Prometheus"" is definently my favorite episode. Two of my favorite guest stars are in this episode. Actress Laurie Prange (who was in ""Death in the Family"" is back for this 2 parter) and actor Monte Morkham (who was a guest star in the '70s western, Alias Smith and Jones) is awesome in this!

My all-time favorite is ""Dark Side"" because fans/viewers are seeing a darker side of David/the Hulk that no one thought they'd ever see. ""Dark Side"" was the first episode I ever watched and I've loved the series since. Also, it would've been interesting to see what McGee would've thought if he had seen a darker side of the Hulk.

Another thing I loved about ""Prometheus"", McGee was able to get inside Prometheus without no one suspecting them! Of course Bill Bixby, Jack Colvin and Lou Ferrigno give their best performances!",1264809600,,1245,4.706422018348624

I thought it was really cool to find out that there was another hulk previous to David Banner.  I felt so bad when the first hulk decided to smash the medicine needed to cure David.

3153614,4,B001675Z2O,"There are spoilers here.

It must be said that this 4th Season of The Incredible Hulk is a mixed bag. I consider myself a big fan and my anticipation for this season was huge, having already heard that double episodes like ""Prometheus"" and ""The First"" were among the best eps in the entire series. In short; The 4th Season includes some of the best episodes but also some of it's lamest.

It's true that ""Prometheus"" is one hell of an episode. It looks like a big budget movie with a fantastic music score and some very impressive production values. It's non stop action, well written and directed by series creator Kenneth Johnson and truly deserves the hype it gets from fans. But, as some others have pointed out, it seems like the whole 4th season budget was spent on that double episode. The others look cheaper and much more scaled down. But there are great highlights.

A light episode called ""Freefall"" is very enjoyable, ""Dark Side"" is very thrilling as we get to see a very nasty David Banner and a Hulk that's ready to kill, ""Deep Shock"" has some very nifty moments as David becomes a precog after suffering electric shock and then there's an episode called ""King of the Beach"" which features Lou Ferrigno in a speaking role and he comes off well. Then as the season progresses we're in for (possibly) the four -best of the rest- episodes; ""The First"", parts 1 and 2, ""The Harder They Fall"" and ""Interview With The Hulk"". ""The Harder They Fall"" is an especially involving episode where David becomes paralyzed after an accident and refuses to willingly transform into the Hulk despite believing that it might help him walk again.

The other episodes here; well, they're about average to lame. Bill Bixby stepped behind the camera for ""Bring Me the Head of the Hulk"" and if it wasn't for some very bad acting and subpar writing the episode would have been a winner. Jack Colvin directs two episodes here; ""Goodbye, Eddie Cain"" and ""East Winds"". Both of them have a different feel from the rest but they're not altogether successful and ""East Winds"" in particular suffers from some horrible acting from supporting actors (William Windom notwithstanding).

Episodes like ""Fast Lane"", ""Wax Museum"", ""Half Nelson"" and ""Patterns"" are prime examples of lazy writing and half hearted attempts at filling the quota.

Take the remaining three episodes of this shortened season. ""Half Nelson"", ""Danny"" and ""Patterns"" are at best easily forgotten episodes and they follow the spectacular episodes ""The First"", The Harder They Fall"" and ""Interview with the Hulk"". Those four eps really should have preceeded an ultimate closure to the series. In many respects ""The Incredible Hulk"" overstayed it's welcome and while it in no way deserved to be axed without a conclusion it really should have laid the groundwork for a finale after those four eps.

David never got closer to finding a cure than in ""The First"" and he was so close that it literally brought him to tears to see his hopes thrashed once again. The hopelessness David goes through in ""The Harder They Fall"" displays well just how tired he is with being a fugitive and his relief to finally speak about his ordeal in ""Interview with the Hulk"" capped things off well. From there on the series should have gone into a double episode finale. Instead we get more of the same adventures with hoods, loan sharks and a midget dwarf (in an episode that seems like a rehash of the First Season's ""Final Round).

Still, this is all very enjoyable for a fan of the series. I can't bring myself to rate the season with less than 4 stars as it contains some of the very best the series had to offer. As always Mr. Bixby brings his usual charm and the great Jack Colvin gets many moments here to shine. Lou Ferrigno does his usual great stuff as the Hulk and does very well in his speaking part episode.

Now 7 episodes remain from the very short Fifth Season in a series filled with so many highpoints and because of a decision by one man (serioulsy; ONE MAN) never got to have a proper conclusion. While that is indeed sad beyond words we can still enjoy many great moments from ""The Incredible Hulk"".",1217635200,2,4147,4.68543956043956
3153615,4,B001675Z2O,"I have been purchasing all of the seasons of the Hulk. Some of the material (cars, special effects) seem rather dated, but the stories for the episodes are usually well thought out and hold up very well after all these years.
Check out some of the other ratings. Most of the people have been saying that the two part episode on season 4 is arguably the best of the best for the Hulk. Called ""Promethus"". I would probably agree. After watching the first four seasons, Premethus I & II could very well be the best of the best.
I remember first watching the episode ""The First"" (two parts) way back on the original air dates and being kind of scared of the other hulk like thing. Watching it now, I really think they could have picked a better actor for the part. I think this was Dick Durock or something. Pretty silly watching him now.

3153617,5,B001675Z2O,"I just bought this season just because Season 3 was out! I am glad I did because this one had some of my favorite episodes from that show. It still had much of the Kenneth Johnson formula but now, we see a little more sci-fi in this one plus we get an unintentional nod to the comic book with the Hulk facing off with the military in Prometheus!

Here are the episodes (not in order necessarily but they are on this set):

Prometheus, Pts. 1 & 2 - While in the woods in Utah, Dr. David Banner runs into a blind woman and helps her cope with her handicap. Meanwhile, a meteor crashes to earth that interferes with Banner's metamorphisis into the Hulk, leaving him between his human form and his monster form! He is captured by a military outfit called ""Prometheus"" and what we get is one great episode!

The First, Pts. 1 & 2 - While investigating a scientist who he thinks may have the cure for his problem, Banner runs into his old assistant and learns that he used to be a creature similiar to The Hulk. Unlike Banner, however, this man wants to be the creature again no matter what and gets his wish with unintentional help from Dr. Banner! Now, the good doctor must risk his own chance to be cured to stop this evil Hulk!

Freefall - A corrupt politician tries to kill Banner while he's parachuting from 12,000 feet!

Deep Shock - After saving a man from electrocution (as The Hulk), Banner discovers that he has temporarily gained ESP.

The Harder They Fall - A car accident leaves Banner paralyzed from the chest down! Banner has to resist the temptation to become The Hulk on purpose in order to heal himself and stop a friend from making a big mistake.

Dark Side - In an attempt to try to control The Hulk's primal rages, Banner's experiment backfires and he becomes a remorsless character who wants The Hulk to wreak havoc! For the first time, The Hulk is capable of murder! Rather scary episode!

Bring Me The Head Of The Hulk - A mercenary wants to kill The Hulk for his own ends but the creature gets help from an unlikely source.

Half Nelson - A rather silly episode that has its comedic moments.

Goodbye Eddie Cain - Interesting episode which sees the Hulk through the eyes of a private eye named Eddie Cain.

King Of The Beach - Lou Ferrigno, in his first speaking role, plays a bodybuilder who decides to do a competition to raise money for his restaurant. Unfortunately, ""King"" (the long time champion) has other ideas and Banner (along with his alter ego) must stop it.

East Winds - A troubled cop tries to help a long time love as Banner is caught in a dispute over smuggled gold.

Interview With The Hulk - A fallen science reporter poses as Jack McGee and talks with Dr. Banner about his life as the Hulk. Looking for a story at first, he has a change of heart and tries to help Banner get away.

Overall, this is what The Incredible Hulk could've been. While its good to have him in the real world, a well done sci-fi eppy here and there (Prometheus/The First) didn't hurt either! This season gets high marks from me!",1213574400,9,3043,4.401069518716578
3153618,4,B001675Z2O,"The 4th season is my favorite after season 2 as the show returns from a lethargic 3rd season to kick into high gear. The Hulk's best episodes were usually the two parters and the 3rd year was totally lacking in any epic episodes. The one episode which could have been an outstanding two fer, ""Homecoming"", was made as a one shot and is standout. But it needed to be bigger.

This season makes up for it in the first episode. ""Prometheus"" is my all-time favorite episode (with ""Myster Man"" of year 2 a very close second), as Banner deals with being stuck in mid-transformation. The cliffhanger is outstanding and this actually would have made a great season ender for year 3. But season ending cliffhangers were just getting started and not the Hulk's forte. The commentary by Kenny Johnson, as usual, has a wealth of fascinating information. Either he kept every scrap of info on his shows at hand or has the best memory of all time. Part 2 is something of a let down as it becomes a series or rampages, enlivened by one really great confrontation between the half-changed Banner and Jack McGee (really, Jack should be piecing this together by now).

Another classic and final two-part episode is ""The First,"" which is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster movies of the 30's and 40's. Dr. Clive, Visaria, Del ""Frye"" are all names taken from those films. The final battle is disappointing since Dick Durock is no Lou Ferrigno (cmoe on, an old Hulk should have been played by no less than Jack LaLanne!), but the pacing is wonderful and the music score (as in ""Prometheus"") is outstanding. Not as much Banner and Hulk in this one, since it focuses on Frye and his creature, but it's interesting to see a murderous Hulk type creature and what he would do. Jack McGee, at this point, isn't just an obsessed reporter. He's become a crusader, out to save the people. It's an interesting change and it's because Bixby and Colvin wanted McGee to be a foil for Banner on par with the doctor. He's been decidedly less sleazy the last two years. :-)

""Free Fall"" is a favorite for nostalia reasons, but it's a solid story. The sky diving shots and the music behind them are beautiful.

Other favorites for me include ""Deep Shock"" where Banner acquires temporary ESP and ""The Harder The Fall"" which is a great story about Banner being paralyzed in an accident, but realizes his healing factor will cure him. In desperation, he actually wants to become the Hulk. When it finally does happen, the creature doesn't understand why his legs won't work. This is, frankly, the last great episode of the series.

Other episodes work on a guilty pleasure level like ""Dark Side"" and ""Bring Me The Head of The Hulk."" But ""Half Nelson"" is just embarrassing (but with some laughs).

Even with the energy petering out toward the end, it's still a superior season, cut short by CBS. The final 5 episodes were aired the next year, but they were shot for season 4. However, these episodes are not on this set (which runs 18 episodes on 4 discs). I wish Universal would have just tacked on season 5, bringing it up to 23 episodes and 5 discs (season 3 has 5 discs). As much as I really love  how they put out two seasons at once to capitalize on the new Hulk movie, they could have wrapped it up with the last 5 (I mean, is 5 episodes considerd a season for any show but The Sopranos?). With luck, the final set will come out when the Hulk movie hits DVD.

Aside from that, a worthy set which makes the series 98% complete now. te commentaries by Ken Johnson are always great and his tributes to the cast and crew no longer with us are truly touching. He really loved his people and it shows. He one again urges people to send him any questions or comments. Do so, he's a great guy to talk to.",1213056000,5,3778,4.497084548104956

3388044,4,B001675Z2O,"After a subpar 1979-1980 season, The Incredible Hulk returned to television in November 1980 after a writer's strike. As the majority of the 18 episodes of the season would show, The Hulk still had plenty left in his tank.  New and inventive storylines were presented, the stars of the show stepped behind the camera as opposed to in front of the camera, and Ol' Greenskin delivered in his first speaking role.  This was to be however, the last hurrah for the big green guy, as the show soon became marred by tragedy and cost cutting.

The season opens with the thrilling two-part action packed episode ""Prometheus.""  David Banner's encounter with a meteor brings out his alter ego. However, Banner finds himself stuck in mid-transformation when he reverts back to his normal(?)self, and the military investigating the creature along with the meteor further complicate matters.  ""Prometheus"" ranks among the best in the all-time episodes of the series and effectively bridges the gap between the first three seasons to the end of the series.

What made season four effective was that the most important episodes centered on Banner and his quest to finally rid himself of the creature, something that season three seemed to lack. This is evident in episodes such as ""Darkside.""  When Banner attempts to supress the emergence of The Hulk, he instead taps into the creature's evil side.  Another episode that reaches into the depths of Banner's subconsciousness is ""Deep Shock.""  When the creature is electrocuted at a power plant, the side effects of the accident have Banner seeing into the future, with  possible fatal results.  The episode at the centermost point of season four is ""The First.""  SPOILER ALERT: This IS the closest that David Banner will EVER come to finding a cure to rid himself of The Hulk. Once Banner thinks he is finally free of the creature, he encounters a man who once had Banner's affliction. Banner discovers that the man is not interested in helping him, but instead longs to have his power back, regardless of the cost.  There would be other episodes after this two-part thriller, but the series in all respects peaked after these episodes.

Series stars Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin directed episodes of the series for the first time during the fourth season. Bixby in ""Bring Me the Head of The Hulk"", another episode dealing with Banner's quest for a cure, and Colvin with ""Goodbye Eddie Cain,"" and the haunting ""East Winds."" All three episodes are solidly done, with Bixby's episode a series standout.

The Incredible Hulk was always great for tearing on the heartstrings of its audience, and season four is no exception. In ""King Of the Beach,"" Lou Ferrigno performs in his first speaking role. The episode is really a showcase for Ferrigno, with Bill Bixby mostly in the background playing a supporting role. While ""King Of the Beach"" is sometimes knocked for its predictable script, the episode is entertaining for its unique photography and touching storyline. In ""The Harder They Fall"", David finds himself adapting to life as a paraplegic.  After some thought, he believes that he can walk again with the emergence of the creature.  One of the most powerful episodes of the series, ""The Harder They Fall"" is a can't miss.

Perhaps the final great episode of The Incredible Hulk is ""Interview With The Hulk.""  When a reporter (not named Magee) traces down Banner and blackmails him into telling his story, Banner agrees. Unbeknownst to Banner, the reporter is from The National Register and Magee is soon on the hunt for both of them.

Oddly enough, it was during the filming of this episode when Bill Bixby (while on the set) learned of his son Christopher's death from a throat infection.  After this episode, ""The Incredible Hulk"" seemed to lose its momentum, and the quality of the show changed drastically for the rest of the season as well as the remainder of its run.  After shooting several less than spectacular episodes in the summer of 1981 that would become the fifth season, The Incredible Hulk was unceremoniously cancelled by CBS due to a slight change in ratings and cost cutting that originally threatened to compromise the quality of season four.

In the ""Deep Shock"" episode David starts being able to see the future with temporary ESP after surviving a brutal electrocution that nearly killed him. In the ""King Of The Beach"" episode Lou Ferrigno does a dual role as well as Lou's first speaking role on this show with David helping Lou(Carl Molina)out with his body building contest and helping him rebuild his confidence with his disability.

In ""The First"", while David continues searching for a cure to stop his struggling ordeal with the Hulk in this 2-parted episode, David stumbles onto the discovery that there was once an evil creature very similar to the Hulk 30 years ago in a small remote town way before David's infliction with the Hulk even started which results in Jack McGee(Jack Colvin)barking up the wrong tree by assuming that the Hulk(Lou Ferrigno)is responsible for the death of 2 small-town bullies that were actually killed by the evil hulk(Dick Durock).

In addition to what made ""The First"" episode intriguing, while David finally finds a cure to his ailment from the Hulk after years of desperate reasearch, David unintentionally ends up helping a bitter old man named Dell Frye(Harry Townes) relive his days and ability to transform into the evil creature again to avenge the bullies who harrassed and taunted him for so long when Frye comes up with the common-denominator after witnessing David transform into the Hulk after getting beat up in Part 1, which therefore contributes to David being put between a rock & a hard place, which basically puts David in a no-win situation with very little hope left to battling his horrid affliction with curing the Hulk while trying to put an end to Frye's ability to continue his relentless charade as the evil Hulk at the same time while David struggles to attempt saving more people from getting hurt and killed by Frye's creature.

Therefore, David's failure to put a stop to Frye's evil creature and the evil Hulk's destruction of David's antidote to finally putting an end to David's fiasco with the Hulk contributes to David transforming into the Hulk again as usual leading the Hulk and Frye's creature to fight to the finish at the end of Part 2 just before the evil Hulk gets killed off by Sheriff Decker(Billy Green-Bush)when McGee(Jack Colvin) finally discovers he's been barking up the wrong tree all along in this entire episode by assuming that all the killings and incidents caused by Frye's evil creature was the Hulk, especially since nobody really knew about the evil Hulk, but McGee still decides to keep tracking the Hulk and David at the end of this episode since McGee is still convinced that the Hulk is still a major danger to society and still continues to pursue the Hulk with a passion, just like the ornery Col. Decker(Lance LeGault) and his disgruntled predecessor Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking)did with Hannibal, Face, and B.A. on THE A-TEAM for similar reasons.

Additionally, Frye's creature(Dick Durock) ended up stealing the show in ""The First"" episode since they had more scenes with the evil creature in this episode than they did of the Hulk, plus they talked about Frye's creature a lot more in this episode than they did about the Hulk too, especially since Dell Frye(Harry Townes)turned into the evil creature 3 times in this episode, but David only changed into the Hulk twice throughout this entire 2-parted episode. In ""The Harder They Fall"" episode David becomes temporarily crippled after getting run over by a car with McGee still hot on the Hulk's trail as usual, but part of what I couldn't help finding intriguing about McGee pursuing the Hulk in ""The Harder They Fall"" episode was also because McGee had also appeared in the previous episode ""The First"", which basically dealt with 2 Hulks in that episode, which McGee even witnessed for himself.

In the ""Interview With The Hulk"" episode; the recluse David reminisces to a mourning down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter(Michael Conrad)by telling him about his horrific struggling 4-year ordeal with the Hulk and how the insistent McGee has been a thorn at his side & a back-burner for David ever since by using clips from previous episodes from the first 4 seasons for example, kind of like they did in the previous season in the ""Proof Positive"" episode.

The Fourth Season was also the first season to have episodes directed by Jack Colvin as well, since he directed the episodes ""East Winds"" and ""Goodbye Eddie Cain"", even though McGee(Jack Colvin) didn't even appear in those episodes, although it would've been nice and more interesting if McGee had appeared in those episodes as well as directed them, but something else I noticed about this 1980-81 Season of the Hulk was McGee seemed to have started coming out less and less often in this season, since McGee didn't appear in as many episodes in the 4th Season as he did in the first 3 seasons, despite the fact that McGee at least appeared in half the 1980-81 Season episodes, but McGee was unfortunately no where to be found in the Hulks 5th Season with the exception of the ""Triangle"" episode(Original Air-Date 11/13/81) which by the way was the last episode shown before this shows sudden cancellation.

Additionally; the 1980-1981 Season was also the last full season of THE INCREDIBLE HULK throughout its whole 4-year run since CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK on such short notice in the middle of its 5th Season without valid warning in the mid-Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in presidency at CBS.

Therefore, the Hulk's Fourth Season was also the season when the special-effects on this show starting getting too expensive, because of all the fiscal budget cuts we had going on back then due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan got elected president in the Autumn of 1980, which was also why THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 4th Season got off to a late start and didn't have their Fourth Season opener episode until November of 1980 instead of having their Season Premiere for the 1980-81 Season in September or October of 1980 due to a strike that was going on in the Summer of 1980.

It was also interesting seeing some cool guest stars in the 1980-81 Season such as

*Jared Martin in the ""Free Fall"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Bill Lucking in the ""Dark Side"" episode before his co-starring days as the overzealous nemesis(Col. Lynch) on THE A-TEAM and after previously guest starring in ""The Antowuk Horror"" episode from the Hulk's 2nd Season.

*Charles Brill in the ""King Of The Beach"" episode before his co-starring days as the no non-sense Capt. Lipschitz on SILK STALKINGS & after his co-starring days on the short-lived series SUPERTRAIN

*Michael Conrad in the ""Interview With The Hulk"" episode during his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES

*Eddie Barth in the ""Patterns"" episode before his co-starring days as Rick & AJ's retired P.I. buddy (Myron Fowler) on SIMON & SIMON

*Billy Green-Bush guest stars on The Incredible Hulk for the second time in ""The First"" episode after previously guest starring in the ""Wildfires"" episode

*Don Stroud in the ""Danny"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Lussen on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET

*Michael Swan in the ""Free Fall"" episode before his co-starring days on AS THE WORLD TURNS & SANTA BARBARA and after previously guest starring in the ""Babalao"" episode in the 3rd Season of the INCREDIBLE HULK, plus this 1980-1981 Season takes me all the way back to memory lane to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president and when the INCREDIBLE HULK was part of CBS's Friday night line-up every week starting with THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM, followed by the DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM, and then DALLAS at 10PM to top that off, which gave me something else to look forward to every Friday, but then the DUKES OF HAZZARD eventually took over the Hulks 8PM time-slot on Friday nights when CBS cancelled this show all of the sudden in mid November of 1981.

Unfortunately CBS had uncerimoniously announced in July of 1981 that they were going to be cancelling the INCREDIBLE HULK when its 5th Season was underway with 7 episodes already in the can which therefore inclined creator(Ken Johnson) to compromise with CBS by at least providing an abbreviated season instead of having a full season or no Fifth Season at all just like NBC ended up doing with the ROCKFORD FILES during its 6th Season when Rockford had abruptly cancelled on short notice back in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner having back and knee problems.

In addition to what led to this shows abrupt cancellation in the mid Fall of 1981 was the president of CBS at the time(Harvey Shepherd)felt that the Hulk was running out of steam plus rumor has it that Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno found it difficult to work with creator(Ken Johnson)and that Johnson was blamed for this show being cancelled because of Johnson and CBS never being able to come up with an agreeable budget to keep running this show. So now that Universal has finally come out with Seasons 3 and 4 on DVD, I don't know what's taking them so long to put the INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season out on DVD, but I hope to see the INCREDIBLE HULK's abbreviated 1981-82 Season come out on DVD soon, especially since the 5th Season was also the last and final season of the INCREDIBLE HULK.

It's just too bad that Universal didn't decide to combine the INCREDIBLE HULK's short-lived Fifth Season onto the Hulk's Fourth Season DVD, especially since the Hulk's 5th Season was only half a season with barely 7 episodes, unlike the first 4 seasons of the INCREDIBLE HULK, but my suspicion on why Universal didn't decide to combine the Hulk's abbreviated Fifth Season to the Hulk's Fourth Season DVD was perhaps due to Universal wanting to get more money out of their customers, especially since Amazon like every other business is seeing quite a decline in sales lately, due to todays humble economy, because of George Bush, Jr's presidency.

Therefore, I initially blame Reagan for THE INCREDIBLE HULK sudden cancellation when it did back in November of 1981 during the middle of its short-lived 5th Season run on CBS, since there was no longer enough money in the budget to keep this show afloat, due to the sluggish economy we had back then during Reagan's presidency.",1206403200,6,11415,4.8311156601842375

And another cool one is ""Interview with the Hulk,"" where one of McGee's colleages at the National Register follows up on a Hulk sighting and when investigating it, he recognizes David Banner and sets up an interview with him. Then of course, McGee shows up on the scene as well.

I rewatched these old shows of the Hulk and found that they are just as interesting now as they were in the '80's. The Hulk is a likable, empathetic creature that feeds the imagination for kids and teaches them about helping others, yet has the excitement of having Dr. Banner turn into the Hulk.

Actress Laurie Prange (who was in ""Death in the Family"" is back for this 2 parter) and actor Monte Morkham (who was a guest star in the '70s western, Alias Smith and Jones) is awesome in this!

My all-time favorite is ""Dark Side"" because fans/viewers are seeing a darker side of David/the Hulk that no one thought they'd ever see. ""Dark Side"" was the first episode I ever watched and I've loved the series since. Also, it would've been interesting to see what McGee would've thought if he had seen a darker side of the Hulk.

Another thing I loved about ""Prometheus"", McGee was able to get inside Prometheus without no one suspecting them! Of course Bill Bixby, Jack Colvin and Lou Ferrigno give their best performances!",1264809600,,1245,4.706422018348624

All the episodes are very entertaining and the scripts are so very interesting , great action and real humanity in all the stories as well.  Bill Bixby is excellent, the only one who can really play the role of David Banner
, who is a brilliant doctor, and who while trying to find a cure for turing into the hulk helps so many people in many ways along his journey.  I must say Lou Ferrigno is a fantastic actor as well and portays more emotion and acting skills, without even speaking in the role as the Hulk.  Brilliant and talents, it was great to see him get a lot of screen time in the episode ,""King of the Beach,"" which he did a great job playing a dual role as the Hulk and and Carl.  One of my favorite episodes.  Excellent season fans will love it, plus the extra features.  Brilliant shows and heartfelt and brilliant acting all around.",1263427200,3,915,4.347058823529411

Season 4 is shorter in episodes, but seemed less hokey. This season has some very cool episodes and they put the Hulk and Banner in a slew of new situations including a body building competition, working at a power plant and coming in contact with a meteor! The set features some good commentary, but little or no extras stuff. Still a worthy season for fans of the Incredible Hulk TV show! Hulk Smash!",1235520000,2,545,4.405940594059406

I would definitely recommend the set for any Hulk fans.  We felt it was a fair value for price.,1222905600,,358,4.634920634920635
3388110,5,B001675Z2O,"I honestly have enjoyed all the seasons of ""The Incredible Hulk"".  I was a fan from when the show first started many, many years ago.  I thought all of the shows were just totally great.  Granted there were some that were a little off the mark, but none the less great.  I have to say the epsisode ""The First"" was my favorite.  I thought it was really cool to find out that there was another hulk previous to David Banner.  I felt so bad when the first hulk decided to smash the medicine needed to cure David.  I could tell that he was very angry and I thought here we go come on Hulk! I haven't gotten the Fifth and very short season yet as it hasn't come out, but intend to when it does.",1220832000,,689,4.059259259259259
3388111,4,B001675Z2O,"There are spoilers here.

It must be said that this 4th Season of The Incredible Hulk is a mixed bag. I consider myself a big fan and my anticipation for this season was huge, having already heard that double episodes like ""Prometheus"" and ""The First"" were among the best eps in the entire series. In short; The 4th Season includes some of the best episodes but also some of it's lamest.

It's true that ""Prometheus"" is one hell of an episode. It looks like a big budget movie with a fantastic music score and some very impressive production values. It's non stop action, well written and directed by series creator Kenneth Johnson and truly deserves the hype it gets from fans. But, as some others have pointed out, it seems like the whole 4th season budget was spent on that double episode. The others look cheaper and much more scaled down. But there are great highlights.

A light episode called ""Freefall"" is very enjoyable, ""Dark Side"" is very thrilling as we get to see a very nasty David Banner and a Hulk that's ready to kill, ""Deep Shock"" has some very nifty moments as David becomes a precog after suffering electric shock and then there's an episode called ""King of the Beach"" which features Lou Ferrigno in a speaking role and he comes off well. Then as the season progresses we're in for (possibly) the four -best of the rest- episodes; ""The First"", parts 1 and 2, ""The Harder They Fall"" and ""Interview With The Hulk"". ""The Harder They Fall"" is an especially involving episode where David becomes paralyzed after an accident and refuses to willingly transform into the Hulk despite believing that it might help him walk again.

The other episodes here; well, they're about average to lame. Bill Bixby stepped behind the camera for ""Bring Me the Head of the Hulk"" and if it wasn't for some very bad acting and subpar writing the episode would have been a winner. Jack Colvin directs two episodes here; ""Goodbye, Eddie Cain"" and ""East Winds"". Both of them have a different feel from the rest but they're not altogether successful and ""East Winds"" in particular suffers from some horrible acting from supporting actors (William Windom notwithstanding).

Episodes like ""Fast Lane"", ""Wax Museum"", ""Half Nelson"" and ""Patterns"" are prime examples of lazy writing and half hearted attempts at filling the quota.

Take the remaining three episodes of this shortened season. ""Half Nelson"", ""Danny"" and ""Patterns"" are at best easily forgotten episodes and they follow the spectacular episodes ""The First"", The Harder They Fall"" and ""Interview with the Hulk"". Those four eps really should have preceeded an ultimate closure to the series. In many respects ""The Incredible Hulk"" overstayed it's welcome and while it in no way deserved to be axed without a conclusion it really should have laid the groundwork for a finale after those four eps.

David never got closer to finding a cure than in ""The First"" and he was so close that it literally brought him to tears to see his hopes thrashed once again. The hopelessness David goes through in ""The Harder They Fall"" displays well just how tired he is with being a fugitive and his relief to finally speak about his ordeal in ""Interview with the Hulk"" capped things off well. From there on the series should have gone into a double episode finale. Instead we get more of the same adventures with hoods, loan sharks and a midget dwarf (in an episode that seems like a rehash of the First Season's ""Final Round).

Still, this is all very enjoyable for a fan of the series. I can't bring myself to rate the season with less than 4 stars as it contains some of the very best the series had to offer. As always Mr. Bixby brings his usual charm and the great Jack Colvin gets many moments here to shine. Lou Ferrigno does his usual great stuff as the Hulk and does very well in his speaking part episode.

Now 7 episodes remain from the very short Fifth Season in a series filled with so many highpoints and because of a decision by one man (serioulsy; ONE MAN) never got to have a proper conclusion. While that is indeed sad beyond words we can still enjoy many great moments from ""The Incredible Hulk"".",1217635200,2,4147,4.68543956043956
3388112,4,B001675Z2O,"I have been purchasing all of the seasons of the Hulk. Some of the material (cars, special effects) seem rather dated, but the stories for the episodes are usually well thought out and hold up very well after all these years.
Check out some of the other ratings. Most of the people have been saying that the two part episode on season 4 is arguably the best of the best for the Hulk. Called ""Promethus"". I would probably agree. After watching the first four seasons, Premethus I & II could very well be the best of the best.
I remember first watching the episode ""The First"" (two parts) way back on the original air dates and being kind of scared of the other hulk like thing. Watching it now, I really think they could have picked a better actor for the part. I think this was Dick Durock or something. Pretty silly watching him now.
Anyway, if you liked the Hulk and have any of the other seasons, you do need to purchase this one as well!",1215216000,,941,4.322033898305085

3388114,5,B001675Z2O,"I just bought this season just because Season 3 was out! I am glad I did because this one had some of my favorite episodes from that show. It still had much of the Kenneth Johnson formula but now, we see a little more sci-fi in this one plus we get an unintentional nod to the comic book with the Hulk facing off with the military in Prometheus!

Here are the episodes (not in order necessarily but they are on this set):

Prometheus, Pts. 1 & 2 - While in the woods in Utah, Dr. David Banner runs into a blind woman and helps her cope with her handicap. Meanwhile, a meteor crashes to earth that interferes with Banner's metamorphisis into the Hulk, leaving him between his human form and his monster form! He is captured by a military outfit called ""Prometheus"" and what we get is one great episode!

The First, Pts. 1 & 2 - While investigating a scientist who he thinks may have the cure for his problem, Banner runs into his old assistant and learns that he used to be a creature similiar to The Hulk. Unlike Banner, however, this man wants to be the creature again no matter what and gets his wish with unintentional help from Dr. Banner! Now, the good doctor must risk his own chance to be cured to stop this evil Hulk!

Freefall - A corrupt politician tries to kill Banner while he's parachuting from 12,000 feet!

Deep Shock - After saving a man from electrocution (as The Hulk), Banner discovers that he has temporarily gained ESP.

The Harder They Fall - A car accident leaves Banner paralyzed from the chest down! Banner has to resist the temptation to become The Hulk on purpose in order to heal himself and stop a friend from making a big mistake.

Dark Side - In an attempt to try to control The Hulk's primal rages, Banner's experiment backfires and he becomes a remorsless character who wants The Hulk to wreak havoc! For the first time, The Hulk is capable of murder! Rather scary episode!

Bring Me The Head Of The Hulk - A mercenary wants to kill The Hulk for his own ends but the creature gets help from an unlikely source.

Half Nelson - A rather silly episode that has its comedic moments.

Goodbye Eddie Cain - Interesting episode which sees the Hulk through the eyes of a private eye named Eddie Cain.

King Of The Beach - Lou Ferrigno, in his first speaking role, plays a bodybuilder who decides to do a competition to raise money for his restaurant. Unfortunately, ""King"" (the long time champion) has other ideas and Banner (along with his alter ego) must stop it.

East Winds - A troubled cop tries to help a long time love as Banner is caught in a dispute over smuggled gold.

Interview With The Hulk - A fallen science reporter poses as Jack McGee and talks with Dr. Banner about his life as the Hulk. Looking for a story at first, he has a change of heart and tries to help Banner get away.

Overall, this is what The Incredible Hulk could've been. While its good to have him in the real world, a well done sci-fi eppy here and there (Prometheus/The First) didn't hurt either! This season gets high marks from me!",1213574400,9,3043,4.401069518716578
3388115,4,B001675Z2O,"The 4th season is my favorite after season 2 as the show returns from a lethargic 3rd season to kick into high gear. The Hulk's best episodes were usually the two parters and the 3rd year was totally lacking in any epic episodes. The one episode which could have been an outstanding two fer, ""Homecoming"", was made as a one shot and is standout. But it needed to be bigger.

This season makes up for it in the first episode. ""Prometheus"" is my all-time favorite episode (with ""Myster Man"" of year 2 a very close second), as Banner deals with being stuck in mid-transformation. The cliffhanger is outstanding and this actually would have made a great season ender for year 3. But season ending cliffhangers were just getting started and not the Hulk's forte. The commentary by Kenny Johnson, as usual, has a wealth of fascinating information. Either he kept every scrap of info on his shows at hand or has the best memory of all time. Part 2 is something of a let down as it becomes a series or rampages, enlivened by one really great confrontation between the half-changed Banner and Jack McGee (really, Jack should be piecing this together by now).

Another classic and final two-part episode is ""The First,"" which is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster movies of the 30's and 40's. Dr. Clive, Visaria, Del ""Frye"" are all names taken from those films. The final battle is disappointing since Dick Durock is no Lou Ferrigno (cmoe on, an old Hulk should have been played by no less than Jack LaLanne!), but the pacing is wonderful and the music score (as in ""Prometheus"") is outstanding. Not as much Banner and Hulk in this one, since it focuses on Frye and his creature, but it's interesting to see a murderous Hulk type creature and what he would do. Jack McGee, at this point, isn't just an obsessed reporter. He's become a crusader, out to save the people. It's an interesting change and it's because Bixby and Colvin wanted McGee to be a foil for Banner on par with the doctor. He's been decidedly less sleazy the last two years. :-)

""Free Fall"" is a favorite for nostalia reasons, but it's a solid story. The sky diving shots and the music behind them are beautiful.

Other favorites for me include ""Deep Shock"" where Banner acquires temporary ESP and ""The Harder The Fall"" which is a great story about Banner being paralyzed in an accident, but realizes his healing factor will cure him. In desperation, he actually wants to become the Hulk. When it finally does happen, the creature doesn't understand why his legs won't work. This is, frankly, the last great episode of the series.

Other episodes work on a guilty pleasure level like ""Dark Side"" and ""Bring Me The Head of The Hulk."" But ""Half Nelson"" is just embarrassing (but with some laughs).

Even with the energy petering out toward the end, it's still a superior season, cut short by CBS. The final 5 episodes were aired the next year, but they were shot for season 4. However, these episodes are not on this set (which runs 18 episodes on 4 discs). I wish Universal would have just tacked on season 5, bringing it up to 23 episodes and 5 discs (season 3 has 5 discs). As much as I really love  how they put out two seasons at once to capitalize on the new Hulk movie, they could have wrapped it up with the last 5 (I mean, is 5 episodes considerd a season for any show but The Sopranos?). With luck, the final set will come out when the Hulk movie hits DVD.

Aside from that, a worthy set which makes the series 98% complete now. te commentaries by Ken Johnson are always great and his tributes to the cast and crew no longer with us are truly touching. He really loved his people and it shows. He one again urges people to send him any questions or comments. Do so, he's a great guy to talk to.",1213056000,5,3778,4.497084548104956
