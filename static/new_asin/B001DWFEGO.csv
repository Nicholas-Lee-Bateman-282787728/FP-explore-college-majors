8295059,5,B001DWFEGO,Wendel Meldrum's brilliant realization of Betty Munson transcends the sometimes wacky world of post-divorce meltdown with profound questions about the structure of our society and female reality.  Saul Rubinek triumphs over the challenge of shooting the film almost entirely through the lens of Betty's video camera with remarkably dynamic and sinuous visuals that serve the story perfectly.  Incredibly entertaining delivery of a very smart film.,1234051200,4,447,5.861538461538461
