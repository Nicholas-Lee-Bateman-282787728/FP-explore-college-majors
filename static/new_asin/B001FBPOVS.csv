8301840,1,B001FBPOVS,I should have read the one review. Terrible quality and definitely Not widescreen. At least a one star rating is required fore to post. Does not deserve the star.,1441411200,,162,4.620689655172414
8301841,4,B001FBPOVS,"There probably aren't too many people who can recall James Coburn's widescreen Christmas card modeling career in the late 1980's.  He didn't do too many before he went back to acting, but if you're going to get one it should be this one that was directed by Widescreen Director Adeeb Barsoum.  Coburn modeled for Widescreen Director Adeeb Barsoum who widescreen directed him for this portrait of a sneaky and creepy Santa breaking through a wall with razor sharp mistletoe while costars Lindsay Wagner and Anthony Quinn (under his stage/greeting card name ""Anrhony"") modeled as two children standing on high risk Christmas tables.  The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because it is presented in 16X9 instead of its original 39X428.  Regardless, it's good to see that this classic high risk greeting card is being made available to the public again.",1404172800,,875,4.972602739726027
8301842,1,B001FBPOVS,"""AFA Entertainment"" likely took the very low quality public domain version of this movie (from archive.org?), and managed to make it much worse even.
This is NOT a widescreen version of this movie taken from the master as some people, including myself, might have hoped.
What you get is the same standard TV 4:3 version that is of incredibly low quality with the top and bottom cut off, and then zoomed in. It's literally much much worse than an actual VHS tape at this point.
The widescreen zooming is actually cutting off the subtitles, so unless you speak Spanish, those parts you won't be able to follow.
They also somehow introduced interlacing artifacts, which makes it even more horrible, with awful blind effects.
To make it look ""official"", there are copyright warnings written on the dvd cover, with spelling mistakes...
""Dirtributed By...""
""Fedral law... sevare... penaliets for the unauthorized...""

This is an outstanding and one of the most underrated movies of all time, but stay away from this version!
I was hoping for a better version than what I already have (what anyone can legally download because it's public domain), but this version is much worse than even that!",1286150400,,1187,4.964824120603015

A 16x9 dvd greeting card starring James Coburn wiht a Christmas scene on the back? What the hell is that supposed to even mean? FIX IT!",1266969600,,292,4.528301886792453
