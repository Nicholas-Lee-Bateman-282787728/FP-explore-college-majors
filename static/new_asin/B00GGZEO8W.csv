8622987,1,B00GGZEO8W,Quality of video recording is poor it does not even take up the whole screen.,1416700800,,77,4.2
8622988,1,B00GGZEO8W,"This is from the infamous 1983 US Festival appearance which (at the time) set a Guinness World Record for the highest-paid single appearance of a band. The quality of the video is OK (with some bordering), but the concert has been severely edited. There is no need to buy this when the whole show is available elsewhere, especially since Eddie's solo has been left off of this DVD - pure sacrilege. Pass on this one.",1411603200,4,416,4.56

8622991,4,B00GGZEO8W,"Now, considering the vintage this was a real find.  Sammy Hagar was a solid front-man, but David Lee Roth was to me the best.  Eddie Van Halen plays at an extraordinary level here.  Video quality is adequate, as can be expected from the analog era.  Only the center of the screen is displayed, with some substantial bordering.  This performance is apparently from just after the release of 'Fair Warning'.  The boys still had a lot of fire, prior to the break with Dave and the full blown alcohol problems of Eddie.  To own a copy of this is a privilege.",1395878400,7,554,4.48
