5711879,5,1945788127,"All my mature life I have longed for a deeper presentation of what the Lord experienced in the Desert. This film portrays this in a way that I've never experienced before. No doubt, the more it is viewed, it will create controversy. It did not cause me to 'trip' in my walk with the Lord, on the contrary, it brought me to tears. It made me stronger. It was REAL to me, just as the Word of God is. I would hope the creators of this film would do other works of the Bible.",1507939200,7,471,4.0212765957446805

5711881,3,1945788127,"It has very good plot. faithful to the gospels, at the same time going deeper into the meaning of Christ's mission. It will expand your understanding of Jesus.
From the point of view of reality, it is too bad that the producers felt that the holy family had too be cast as blond/blue eyed stock, unlike the majority of middle eastern folks - and contradicting how the gospels describe Jesus's appearance. They do not trust the audience to see beyond western stereotypes of what a messiah should look like.",1506384000,4,505,4.685393258426966
5711882,5,1945788127,"We saw this at the theater and wanted a copy of our own!! A different perspective on the story of Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness. Great acting, well told story, and over all great movie!!  Looking forward to more movies by DJ Perry and this great cast.",1502668800,,254,4.291666666666667
5711903,5,1945788127,"Though the scriptures in this area are very short, they did a great job on expanding it and adding a lot of depth. Truly inspirational and emotional depiction. In the line of pictures like the ""passion of christ"" as it adds much more depth to scripture. The only negative, which was a small one is I don't like the interpretation that Christ didn't drink water for 40 days. I think scripture, and real life points out that although man can survive 40 days without eating, he would not survive that long without drinking, and Christ was a man, subject to our frailties. But if you can overlook this minor thing, this is a real win for Christianity.",1522540800,,647,4.538461538461538
5711904,5,1945788127,"amazing and very unexpectedly GOOD. the temptataion of jesus in the wilderness like ive never seen it told. the way the devil and jesus talk of humans and the creation of everything is mroe honest than most movies portray and the last minute of the movie will absolutely make you feel the joy of christ and the truth of GOD. the director did something almost NEVER done in any movie about JESUS. not gonna spoil it for you here but it was truly unexpected and brilliant!! powerful, moving, truth and absolutely captures the twisted tongue of satan.",1522540800,,548,4.65979381443299
5711905,5,1945788127,For the believers in Christ Jesus. this Film shows more of a general idea what Jesus went through the Wilderness after being Baptize by the Holy Spirit and was led to the desert. for 40 days and night. if Jesus went through it we will also go through the wilderness Journey.  try it you'll like it.,1520899200,,298,4.321428571428571

5711907,5,1945788127,"Of course you will find artistic license in this film, but nothing heretic at all. It's one of the best films about Jesus, and as far as I know the only film that focus on the topic of his 40 days in the desert. Great acting, you feel stronger in your faith when you watch how Jesus responds to the devil. Amazing location, great dialogues and good acting. Sure they could have improved the dialogues between the Virgin Mary and her son; also the Virgin Mary appearance looks somewhat modern, but lets stay wth the good parts.",1517011200,3,526,4.43298969072165

5711911,5,1945788127,Excellent movie on Christ's 40 days in the desert. Good  lead into it via his time with John the Baptist and a realist portrayal.  Being able to visualize and ponder scripture thru cinematography makes it even more relatable for me. I hope millions of others get the same appreciation.,1514073600,,285,4.795918367346939
5711912,3,1945788127,"I love the story and plot line. I pray that I will never get tired of hearing it.  But, come on, this movie was cheesy from beginning to end..",1513728000,,142,3.896551724137931
5711923,5,1945788127,Well done and touches the heart. This is a gold nugget of a film I was pleasantly surprised to see. It will reassure you of God's love.,1511654400,,135,4.037037037037037
5711924,2,1945788127,"Had a lot of great potential, but failed to deliver with some very troubling theological issues.

CONS:
1. Jesus is God in human vesture, He is the Word made Flesh. He is fully God and Fully Man. Despite the human frailties, He still is all knowing and is very much aware of what He must do. He never second guesses the Will of the Father, since His Will is one with the Father. One can argue, about His moment int he Garden of Gethsemane as ""second guessing"", when He prayed, ""if it is possible, let this cup pass me, but not my will but yours be done"". This is an appeal with being one with our human nature despite knowing what is to come. In the film, there was a really poor job done of this, it really emphatically conveys second guessing God the Father, and essentially Himself (God the Son).

2. Irreverent portrayals of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Gabriel the Archangel. Again, aside from Christ they do the Will of God most perfectly in Scripture and Tradition. They don't second guess, they don't allude at selfishness and then repent from it when corrected. That may be true of other creatures, but not of them. The Blessed Virgin Mary is the only earthly creation that ever cooperated and did God's Will perfectly since she was born without Original Sin in order to even have Christ dwell in her womb, that's why our Blessed Mother is the Ark of the New Covenant.

3. This was a major one, satan cannot harm God. Why then was is conceived that the devil can whack Jesus Christ over the head with a stick? One reason is that satan or demons are spiritual creatures that are immaterial, even if God allowed them to assume a physical manifestation in testing our Lord they can't touch Him without allowing it. When He takes the evil one's hand, He allows that the father of lies is not harmed. Jesus Christ dispels satan, Christ commands all creation. So Him being smashed over the head by satan is completely stupid in my opinion.

PROS:

1. The temptations and psychological torments were well done, it definitely follows the logic of the fallen one's eternal perspective in damnation. The challenging of God's goodness, God's perfection, and hatred of human beings because of God's will that we may be saved despite our rebelliousness unlike satan and his minions that had one final and eternal judgement without the chance of redemption. This is why the evil one works so hard to tempt us in throwing away our redemption.

2. The quaint little interactions of Jesus had with people, the dialogue was good but the acting and delivery could have been a little better. It seemed a little too robotic? I don't know, the lines were good but the performances didn't seem natural at times.

3. The locations, the scenery and cinematography was all really nice. I really liked it.

These are the reasons I didn't rate it 1 star to be honest, it's being generous given some of the really troubling theological issues I had that I get come from a place that tries to make Christ relatable, but compromises the essence of Christ's Nature, which potentially misleads people into heretical beliefs of Christ.

Stray observation: The lamb? I mean I get what they were going for I think, but I honestly thought it was unnecessary to have a spotted lamb that Jesus names Moses in it. If they were going for that angle, why couldn't the filmmaker at least go with an unspotted lamb as the Scriptures prescribe?",1511568000,5,3411,4.606260296540363
5711925,5,1945788127,This moved was deeply moving and made a big impression. A realistic dramatization.,1511481600,,82,5.384615384615385

5711927,4,1945788127,"We host a monthly Christian movie night at a local theatre in Navasota, TX. Miller's Theatre donates its space for our movie showings and we are able to show our films without admission charge.

Yesterday, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, we shared 40 Nights, by DJ Perry. Which is the first film of a trilogy, 40 Nights, Chasing the Star and the soon to be released, Christ Slayer. DJ was generous enough to license our showings and to provide background material for our showing.

We had about 40 people in attendance for our showing and we were very pleased with the audience reaction which ended in applause at the close of the film.

40 Nights a is well done telling of Christ's 40 days in the wilderness from an intimate perspective of Christ's experience in building His strength for the coming trials of his ministry and its conclusion in the crucifixion.

We recommend this film to viewers who seek a deeper perspective on Christ's experience at the beginning of His ministry and the challenges met in the wilderness.",1510531200,,1016,4.72316384180791
5711928,1,1945788127,This film is complete and total heresy Christ always knew who He is: He had a Human nature true but He is divine and  both natures were perfect in Him there was no battle or confusion in Him of any kind : This is just foolish artistic license that is total complete garbage,1509494400,14,273,4.150943396226415
5711929,5,1945788127,"As a person who looks for authenticity in casting, this film seemed a bit jarring in the first 20 minutes or so.  A nearly all Caucasian cast with American accents playing Bible characters admittedly had me a little uncomfortable in the beginning.  However if you can get over that hump as I did, the rest of the film is really good, if not great!  Not a long film (less than 90 minutes), it covers a period of time in the Bible not widely discussed and left open for a bit of interpretation.  It centers on the forty days and nights Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness.  In the Bible, Satan tempted Jesus three times.  However, it WAS forty days.  So, its natural to assume there are deeper facets to that context.  Director Jesse Low and Lightworx made a beautiful film filled with great dialogue (including some interesting undocumented exchanges), gorgeous cinematography, and an amazing soundtrack while all the time preserving the foundation of the word of God.  Bravo!!!",1509235200,2,986,4.752941176470588
5711930,5,1945788127,I loved it!  Jesus resisted temptation for 40 days when we can't even avoid it in one day.  Really powerful and I was full of emotions. From  being angry with the devil to Jesus powerful words and his reason for saving us.  Thank you for this film.,1508976000,,248,4.212765957446808
5711931,1,1945788127,"I couldn't even get through 10 minutes of this movie without it going against scripture. This movie shows John baptizing Jesus without knowing he was Jesus, which clearly goes against the Bible. He also tells Jesus that he(John) must decrease while Jesus must increase, the only problem is John didn't say that to Jesus according to the Bible, instead John says that to one of his(John's) followers. Reference: Matthew 3:13-17 & John 22-30",1508889600,17,439,5.027397260273973
5711932,5,1945788127,"I Lovvvve this movie!!! I've now seen it 3x on Amazon prime, it brings me to tears, it brings it home of His enduring those 40 days and nights! Superb job on this film!! Sheer brilliance!! This has truly blessed my heart!! Thank you!!",1508544000,2,234,4.340909090909091
8579881,1,1945788127,This movie was terrible.  Very inaccurate.  Acting was horrible. If they just would  have stuck to the scriptures KJV this wouldn't have been so bad.,1531008000,,149,4.88
8579882,3,1945788127,"Well, the first thing I noticed was how it deviated from scripture. A bunch of bible verses thrown in where they didn't belong, and a LOT of artistic license. That being said, not a lot was written in the Bible about how the forty days of being in the wilderness was spent. We know that Jesus was tempted, and that's about it, and though the whole story was imagined by who wrote the screenplay, and it is not gospel, it was still a pretty good story. As long as the viewer keeps in mind, it is mostly fictional, it was ok to watch.",1530230400,,532,4.174757281553398
8579883,5,1945788127,"Better than the Tripe that makes up movies today. Good Message, who can argue with ""Love Each other Love ME Love HIM""",1530057600,,117,4.363636363636363
8579884,4,1945788127,Awesome movie. Love it,1526515200,,22,4.75
8579885,3,1945788127,"Come on, we all know there's a script already written. Absolutely do NOT deviate from it, else it becomes a lie, and we all know who the father of all lies is.

Also, minus points for missing bits. John acts like he doesn't know who Jesus is, yet later on it's revealed they've been friends since childhood? Jesus is referred to as Yeshewa for the first half of the show, then they suddenly switch to Jesus? Mary has a modern haircut? And again with the all-white cast? And an overweight Jesus to boot? The acting is fair to midlin, at least done well enough it didn't make me want to rip my ears off. The man who portrayed the elder Satan character was actually pretty decent.

Having said that, I'm still going to give it three stars, but only because it depicts a very serious time of Jesus' life and some of the turmoil he surely would have gone through during his long trial.

Also, note to writers: PLEASE learn how to properly use the pronouns ""I"" and ""me"". If in doubt, remove the other person from the sentence and test which would be appropriate. And if you can't be bothered to remember that, a good rule of thumb is: A misused ""I"" sounds pretentious and snooty. A misused ""me"" sounds down-homey, so it's much better to make the mistake on that side.",1524528000,,1261,4.4034334763948495
8579886,1,1945788127,I find the way they have gone against scripture to be offensive. They have taken too many liberties where they didn't need to- Im not sure why? I like the idea behind the project- I just wish it was true to what the Bible says.,1524528000,2,227,4.066666666666666
8579887,4,1945788127,"Interesting movie about Yeshua being temped by Satan for 40 days in the wildness. I know this was just a movie and some of the things in the movie did not lined up with scriptures this is why I only give it a 4 star rating. The movie did include sayings that Yeshua said while He walked the earth. I know Mary mentioned Yeshua by his Hebrew name which was awesome, however everybody else used the name Jesus. If they could have done a perfect job of using the name Yeshua and making sure everything lined up with scriptures it would have made a great 5 star movie.",1524355200,,564,4.231481481481482
8579888,5,1945788127,One of the most significant messages I have been blessed to watch in a long time. This movie illustrates just how much Jesus was willing to do for us and the kind of unimaginable love that comes with having God as our Father. Highly recommend it!,1524009600,,246,4.369565217391305
8579889,2,1945788127,The description of this movie is very disturbing.,1523059200,,49,5.25
8579890,1,1945788127,"Christ never doubted or had to ask who He was. This is strongly inaccurate. John the Baptist paved the way for his cousin, knowing he had to decrease so that Christ could increase in the people. I could not get even 10 minutes into the film. Very disappointed.",1522540800,4,260,4.4375
