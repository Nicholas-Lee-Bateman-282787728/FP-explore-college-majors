4519309,4,B00511N7BW,"This is for people considering the Godfather/Godfather II Two pack in Blu-ray format.

What you get for $20 is the first two movies only, with no special features other than the original director commentary.

These are same ""Coppola Restoration(s)"" as the pricier set that includes Godfather Part III and an additonal disc of bonus features.

Are they as sharp and sound intensive as contemporary films on Blu-ray? No.

Are they better than the earlier DVD versions? Yes. There is still film grain and high contrast here, but this is the nature of the source material. What you won't see are the artifacts that cropped up on lower capacity DVDs.

As other reviewers have said, if you want the best transfers of these particular, seminal films, this is it. If you watch them in a darkened room you will get as close to the original circa 1970's theater experience of these films as you ever will get, and this is a good thing.

I would have liked the additional features in the more expensive set, but you have to buy all three movies to get the extras. Like many people, I am not a fan of Godfather III, so for $30 less, I got these two classics.",1312934400,53,1146,4.538834951456311
8452185,5,B00511N7BW,"THE GODFATHER

RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.

MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, whos basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michaels American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the hysterical sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.

Im not big on gangster flicks because its hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually cant wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, The Godfather is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.

Highlights abound, starting with Brandos great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michaels rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968s Bullitt); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent love at first sight moment in Sicily; Sonnys beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michaels men carrying out their wicked deeds.

Whats the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzos book.

THE GODFATHER: PART II

RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part II"" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as Godfather with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vitos life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.

MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michaels wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husbands shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.

The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michaels story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the characters interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. Im not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. Im just saying that hes not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. Hes just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Lifes hard enough without taking that shady route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO its not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. Its good for what it is, but its overrated by people who cant see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film its almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know its sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.

THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.

8452186,5,B00511N7BW,"These are two incredible and amazing films. Francis Ford Coppola's direction of THE GODFATHER is something of a dichotomy. On one hand director Coppola gets the details of the Italian-American experience down to the minutest detail. He accomplishes this with great storytelling combing script, dialogue, performances and editing. Unfortunately the actions of these family members are so appealing to audiences that it in effect glamorizes a certain lifestyle and singles out a particular ethnic group. However using his great innovative techniques Coppola created a cultural phenomenon. From a cinematic viewpoint Coppola's direction simply wins the viewer over with such grace and appeal that there is no room for ethical consequences. For years director John Ford decimated thousands of American Indians under the watchful eyes of Monument Valley. Nobody seemed to mind much in the end. Sometimes you are remembered for how well you tell a story and not so much for what the story has to say. Filmmaking can be a very dichotomous business.

THE GODFATHER PART II is an amazing squeal rivaling the original. It completes, to some degree, and also extends the saga. Troy Donahue played a brief, but pivotal role in THE GODFATHER PART II as Merle Johnson. Near the beginning of the film Johnson intends to marry Connie (Talia Shire) as he is seen in an audience with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). The importance of this scene is to point out the moral principles of the two men each from dissimilar backgrounds. One, Merle Johnson is a man with an obscure and dubious background. The other, Michael Corleone is an affluent underworld entrepreneur. Is either man better than the other is? It depends on your point of view. That is the point that director Coppola wants to point out. The more I think about it this film is not just about the power of the underworld but about the power of cinema itself. In the first film Coppola won over many members of the audience and welcomed them into the family. When Merle Johnson meets Michael Corleone the audience almost entirely sides with Michael. Regardless of the doubtful Merle Johnson do you think he has any blood on his hands? He probably doesn't. That is the power of the cinema. By the way, Merle Johnson is Troy Donahue's real name. Troy was born as Merle Johnson, Jr. on January 27, 1936 in New York, NY.",1426723200,,2357,4.9072681704260654
