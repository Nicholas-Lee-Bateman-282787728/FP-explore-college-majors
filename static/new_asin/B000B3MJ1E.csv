8305197,5,B000B3MJ1E,"Fantastic collection, well worth the price of the set and an investment in a region 2 DVD player, if you haven't already done so.  David Attenborough excels at sharing his knowledge and excitement with the viewer, and the topics in this set provide plenty of variety.  A fantastic addition to any documentary collection.  Note that if you purchase this as a gift, you might need to gift the recipient with a region 2 player as well.  (These will not play on a computer, either, unless you have extensive technical skill and a spare computer to dedicate solely to the task of playing region 2 discs. An extra DVD player makes for a  simpler and more economical solution.)",1485907200,,670,4.6923076923076925
8305198,5,B000B3MJ1E,"I almost returned this item after having no success playing these region 2 disks on multiple multi-region dvd players. Then I realized
all I had to do was switch the region settings on my macbook pro. Im told you can only switch the region settings a total of 4 times so keep that in mind if your considering ordering this set.",1378944000,3,327,4.377049180327869
8305199,5,B000B3MJ1E,"This collection contains so many discs. I am sure buying them individually would cost atleast twice as much.
The programs on these discs are as usual fantastic because of the high-quality of BBC and David Attenborough.

Just be sure you understand the compatibility issues with PAL formatted discs with region set to 2 and 4. I managed to play them on my Laptop but they won't play on my DVD player",1373846400,2,398,4.605633802816901
