8027221,5,B0002EJ7Z8,"This is a Old and interesting Film. I ordered this DVD, It Came in on Time. The Quality of Picture and Sound are Excellent.
The Movie has a Nice Good Ending Story of a Married Man and his Temporarily Temptation of having an affair with another Woman, but at the End he Comes Back to his Wife.",1395619200,,292,4.140350877192983
8027222,4,B0002EJ7Z8,"I enjoyed this movie when I was a teenager, and after a long time I still enjoy this movie every time I watch.",1387584000,,110,3.8260869565217392
8027223,4,B0002EJ7Z8,"This film at least has a MAJOR British band in it from the 60's and the 70's PINK ONIONS aka ELECTRIC BANANA aka PRETTY THINGS Their up there with The Beatles. They do five songs and you get to see shots of them playing 4 of them in these club scenes. When there is not much video of the band at this time in their career THIS IS NICE TO SEE. The songs are all, In there entirety on the CD MORE ELECTRIC BANANA The song What's Good For The Goose, That they didn't use as the opening intro song but stuck a part of it in somewhere.  Who knows what's ended up on the cutting room floor? Somebody's re packaged this with people who are not even in the movie on the cover!!!! THIS IS PROBABLY A SCENE THAT GOT CUT OUT OF THE FILM. This DVD is good quality at least. And if I can't find a better version I'll just pick up this cheap version.",1295049600,2,836,3.9761904761904763

8027225,2,B0002EJ7Z8,"Hardly in the best tradition of Norman Wisdom.

Stodgy banker gets involved with sixties free-love hippies but then goes back to his wife and life. Not comparable with the fifties Norman Wisdom films (Up in the world, On the best, etc)",1153872000,4,235,4.7317073170731705
8027226,2,B0002EJ7Z8,"While the movie is a well-made and fairly amusing late-60's British comedy and has been well transferred to DVD by Image, this is a heavily edited/censored version of the original and would easily achieve a PG-13 rating.",1110326400,10,220,4.972972972972973
