7854991,5,630382997X,"I loved this series and have all the Sharp's collection.  The story is mainly about the Napoleonic wars beween England and France.  Sean Bean does a great job of playing Sharp,along with his sidekick Daragh O'Malley. The episodes take place and are filmed in the Crimea, Portugal and England. The stories are not one dimentional.  They involve danger, spectacle and romance.  The supporting cast are outstanding and their characters will stay with you, particularly the French spy, Major Piere Ducos, a very nasty character.  The series was based on Bernard Corwell's novel.  Sharp is a hero and a ladies man. His friend, O'Malley brings an Irish brogue and humor to the story along with his other sharpshooters.  You will like them.  Buy it.

Since I own the complete series,(combo of VHS and DVD), including Sharp's India episodes, this review covers all. They are all entertaining.",1327276800,,884,5.041379310344827
7854992,5,630382997X,"We get four new adventures of Major Richard Sharpe as ge continues his battle through Spain.
Sharpe's Honor is the best of the lot as we see the return of Ducos as a villian and Alice Kirge without her borg queen makeup but still carrying the moments she is on screen.  All this as Sharpe is suffering from the death of his wife.
Sharpe's Gold is the worst of the lot.  The subplots are much better than the main plot and the actors carry it well.  The ""villian"" of the piece just doesn't work for me, but fine acting and great subplots make this worth seeing.  It is my choice for the worst of the 14 Sharpe movies (meaning only 4 stars)
Sharpe's Battle is an improvement with a fine plot, (an Irish brigade) a great villian (Gen Loup) and fine foil (The Lord Riely) and best of all for me character actor Ian McNeice as Wagon Master General Runciman providing a ton of comic relief as he always does.  Add to that many great battle scenes and we have a real winner.
Sharpe's Sword suffers from a wooden villian but not much else.  The return of Sharpe's foe Sir Henry is interesting, the subplots are fine and the supporting actors support well.  A tad too mellodramatic at some points but, hey were all here to have fun.
All and all a worthwhile investment for any Sharpe fan.",1008201600,10,1279,4.348739495798319
