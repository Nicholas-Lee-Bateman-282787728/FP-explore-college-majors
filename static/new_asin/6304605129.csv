7876247,3,6304605129,"Peter Whittaker (son of Lou Whittaker) leads a climb of three to the top  of Huayna Potosi, an impressive 20,000' peak just outside of LaPaz. While  Whittaker's energy shows well in practicing for the climb, the film does  not lay out the climb very well (and contains some factual inaccuracies),  or show very dramatic footage of the climb. It does however succeed in  showing the preparation that goes into the climb once in LaPaz, and some  nice shots of the surrounding area, including Lake Titicaca. This tape  would work best for someone heading to the Andes hoping to climb a high  peak that does not require great technical skills. (Note: While the tape is  named ""Parts 1&2"" it is really only 1 tape, totaling about 50  minutes).",969062400,,738,4.74015748031496
