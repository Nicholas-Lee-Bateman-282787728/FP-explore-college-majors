8495911,5,B006B84CTA,It is not GONE WITH THE WIND or even WIND or SALMON FISHING ON THE YEMEN or MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.  But it is a fun movie to watch at Christmas time and I would think you would want it in your collection of holiday movies.  All of the cast does way better than good.,1358380800,,262,3.8333333333333335
