3882685,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I am an intermediate exerciser who prefers to work out at home.  This is my first DVD with Cindy and I loved it.  As with most any workout it can be as hard or as easy as what you put into it.  I liked the one minute intervals which help you push through as you can see the end in sight for that particular segment.  I also like that during many of the cardio segments she builds on what was just done in the previous weights segment. Don't be fooled by the one minute segments, though.  I am always sore the day after doing her work out and I am used to Jari Love and Jillian Michaels

For those of you who prefer a trainer who doesn't talk too much, you might want to borrow at your local library before buying.  Cindy talks non stop during both sessions.  However, she is not over bearing, pushy, or sugary.  Even with all the talking, this DVD is definitely worthwhile.

The only but I find with this DVD is that the stretching at the end is very short.  I feel that a few more minutes would have been better as she does work your entire body when doing both segments back to back.",1262390400,2,1085,4.119047619047619
3882686,5,B0029Z8K3I,"...and I have over 100 excercise dvds now... Some women buy shoes...I keep myself motivated by trying new dvds...

so I have some comparison. :-)

CALORIE BURN: I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn. Because of this, I'm also able to monitor exactly how many calories I burn during a dvd workout, and know exactly how many calories it burns per minute. Because a strength training dvd will also continue to burn more calories after the workout, I can also monitor the increase if there is one. I say this only so you'll know what I rate is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. DANG! If you had to only own two dvds to make a difference in your body I'd choose this one and Jillian Michael's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism to scorch the calories. The calorie burn was EXTREMELY boosted in this dvd.

CIRCUIT TRAINING: Studies have shown you'll actually burn more calories doing a circuit workout...meaning that you combine both cardio and strength training. Cardio will burn more calories during the workout, but strength training, although it burns less during the workout, will continue to burn calories long after the workout is over and will help build muscle--which also increases metabolism and utilizes more calories even while you are at rest. This dvd takes it to the highest level by doing heavy cardio and then allowing your heart rate to recover during strength, and then getting it back up again. Just like a car uses more gas when alternating slow and fast speeds rather than going fast all the time, it's been shown your body uses more calories doing the same thing. And keeping your heart rate elevated during strength provides that higher calorie burning benefit with toning which continues to burn more later. Very well done.

CUEING: I'm very picky about cueing. I want a workout rather than having to rewind my dvd and figure out what the instructor is trying to tell me what to do in a heavily choreographed but difficult-to-follow routine. There was no rewinding on this one. The steps and instructions were clear and it kept you moving fast without losing a step. A difficult thing to get right, but it was accomplished here.

SET: Boring. One of those studios made to look like a set...but that's fairly common in many dvds. No big thing. But nothing to make note of either.

MOVES: Impressive. Although the workout is combined into two circuit training sections of 30 minutes each (the first one works your legs, tush, and belly and the second your entire upper body and abs), you can combine the two if desired. I like that she added standing ab moves in that you are working your obliques (stomach muscles) while MOVING rather than on the floor so you get the cardio benefit as well. There were also some kickboxing moves which help speed up the calorie burn. Well thought out but nothing difficult to do or follow.

LEVEL: While the calorie burn is intense, a beginner could start here with very light weights and be able to do it at his or her pace and progress with heavier weights. Because you recover during the strength moves you won't wear out during the cardio. Too, a fitness buff will love it for the results.

TRAINER: There is only one, there are no backup people behind her as you'll see in many dvds. This means there is no ""beginner level"" person in the back if you are just starting out and want a lower impact trainer to follow until you progress upwards, but I think you can pull through even if you need to do less reps or slower movements. Both are possible. Her energy is good and her instructions are clear. I actually prefer to have more people behind the trainer simply for visual interest when staring at the same dvd for a half hour but no big deal.

SAFETY: The instructions are excellent so that you not only do the moves easily, but you do them so they are safe and effective. Out of all the dvds I have no instructor has ever told me to stare at a certain spot on the floor during balance moves in order to help you not wobble. I had previously done balance poorly and was wobbling again until she said this. BAM! For the first time, I mastered all balance moves in this dvd and my others. (Don't worry if you hate balance moves like me, there are few and you could do them with your foot on the floor til mastered, but it does help your core so I keep working at it.)

TIME CRUNCH: There are ""10 Minute Solutions"" dvds which are supposed to be used if you only have time to do a 10 minute workout. This burned twice as many calories in 10 minutes as those...so if you have a crunch on time, you might just use part of one of these workouts and do a cooldown on your own.

MUSIC: Upbeat and flowed with the moves.

EQUIPMENT: Although she recommends light and heavy weights, you can use the same weight the whole time if that's all you have...for example, sometimes I just use my 6 pound weights the whole time and if the reps get to hard to do I put em down and do the moves without em. If you have a light and heavy set, you are good to go, but will not be hindered if you do not.

ALSO INCLUDED: Inside the dvd case there is a booklet called ""The better body meal plan"" which is a 1200-1300 calorie per day diet by a nutritionist that also notes men need to add an additional 300-400 clories to the menu per day. It is 10 days of menus you can follow to lose weight with items that are easy to prepare and take a couple to just a few minutes of prep time, such as a chicken breast with salsa, brown rice, & broccoli for lunch, apple with peanut butter for a snack etc. As a weight loss coach myself I'd say it's a decent and protein and nutrient rich diet so, although I don't use her diet, I have no doubt it would work based upon its components ifyou want to take her challenge of a better body in 10 days.

NEGATIVES: As far as the workout and instruction goes, it was flawless and incredibly well thought-out for effectiveness and calorie burn. But I gotta say, one of the reasons I have so many dvds is because I hate being bored in working out. I think there were some additions they could have added to this dvd to make it less ""sterile"", like a class or back up trainers in the background, a less sterile set, etc but that's just if I had to add something...that's merely my own personal taste as someone else may find what I like ""distracting"".

CONCLUSION: This is one of my new favorites for when I need fast results. I'd suggest it as an addition to a fitness dvd collection no matter how large or small you want your dvd collection to be...it's a true result-maker.

3882687,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I consider myself a pretty advanced exerciser. I've lost over 25 pounds in 6 months using exercise DVD's and my elliptical. I'm now down to a size 4/6 (5'6"" - used to be a size 12) and exercise pretty much every day. Two of my absolute favorites were Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones. They would kick my ass every time. Well that was the case until I found this DVD! I popped it in and she starts right up. There is only one instructor. I loved that, I felt like I was getting one-on-one training time in. She's not annoying and is quietly motivating.  Very stark contrast to Jillian who's annoying comments leave me putting the DVD on mute the whole time. (Sorry Jillian!) She also constantly reminds you to use proper form and demonstrates it very well too. Her body is a bit masculine, but that didn't put me off. She's had 2 kids, and if she can look that great - well that's motivating to me! I'm here to get healthy and look better, nothing else really matters. I did the two 30 min. parts back to back, and BOY was I feeling it! I was sweating like a dog and sore everywhere. I don't get sore or winded at all anymore from Jillian's DVD's, so I knew my body was working extra hard with this one. I'm very pleased! I love the easy format, it's wonderful to follow along for complete beginners and yet is challenging enough for advanced exercisers too. I used 5 lb. and 10 lb. dumbbells with no problems, too. I'll be doing this one over and over again, I find it more motivating than my other DVD's. Can't wait to do it again!",1259884800,19,1571,4.3074324324324325
3882688,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I bought this video based on the previous reviews and am not dissatisfied. I cannot do everything the instructor can, as I am an ""intermediate level"" 55 year old with shoulder issues.  So I have to be careful to remember to MODIFY anything involving shoulders. No regular pushups, little weight above the shoulder, etc. I like the way I can get a good upper or lower body workout WITH CARDIO in just thirty minutes. However, when I have more time, I prefer the more mellow Karen Voight workouts (Lean Legs and Buns; Firm Arms and Abs)which give me more warm-up and cool-down time, feel less rushed, and have better music (but no cardio). I follow those with a brisk walk or cardio video/dvd.  They're all good choices.  You can preview and read more reviews about many exercise videos on [...].  It's worth the investment of time.",1259539200,4,830,4.664383561643835
3882689,5,B0029Z8K3I,"This is a great workout.  I have a history of back problems here and there, so when I start a new dvd, I try to go once through it without any weights to make sure I get form right before I add weights that could stress my back.  With this workout, I got a pretty good workout even without the weights!  With the weights, it's even better. She really throws in a variety of moves that keep it interesting and work a lot of different muscles.  It also goes really quickly because it's broken down into 1 minute sections--she keeps saying ""you can do this, you only have to do it for one minute"", and it is totally true: you do hard moves, but it doesn't seem so bad because you don't have to do it very long.  I would count myself as an experienced beginner exerciser (I've done a lot of exercising in the past, but am now getting back into it after lapsing for a while), and this was definitely good cardio on top of weight training...in fact, my heart rate was up pretty much the entire time (higher during the cardio sections, but still pretty high during the weight training sections).  Also (and I think very importantly) it was a fun workout.",1255219200,4,1147,4.311627906976744
3882690,5,B0029Z8K3I,"Reasons I love these 2 workouts:
- One 30min workout for upper body and one for lower body but the cardio in between makes it feel whole body.

- It flips back and fourth between 1min weights/strength 1min cardio which makes me work really hard at both because I know it's just 1min before we switch.

- Cindy's has a great demeanor, motivating without being annoying.

- You get out of it what you put in meaning it can be modified for beginners but if you go for it you will definitely be sweating. By the 3rd day I was sore in a good way because she hit areas in my legs that apparently I wasn't getting to :)

Note: this is the the same as the DVD with the Blonde in the pink bikini titled Results Fitness: 10 Days to a Better Body. The cd inside actually has the blond/pink bikini on it(not Cindy). I think they changed the outer cover for marketing.",1253145600,10,855,4.195121951219512

3882693,1,B0029Z8K3I,"There are 2 dvd with this title and this instructor. Maybe the other dvd is more along the lines of what they say on the packaging, but this one IS NOT. I can't say anything about the dvd itself, as I have not even watched it. I do notp[ exercise my whole body at once -- I alternate upper body and lower body. So I try to make sure that all of the dvds I buy are split up like that. This one claims to be set up as two 30 min routines -- 1 upper body, 1 lower body --  which is exactly what I was looking for. However, when I finally put the dvd in to watch the workouts before I first attempted them, what I found was a menu that listed 5 different weighted sections combining upper AND lower body, split by 3 sets of cardio. So, yeah -- WTF??? This is completely and totally not what it says on the back cover. Unfortunately, it's past the time I can return it so I'll just have to face the fact that this was a complete waste of money. VERY disappointed.",1397347200,2,958,3.9637305699481864
3882694,1,B0029Z8K3I,I've ordered this 2 times and both times was sent the Boost your Metabolism DVD that was in this case.  The instructor isn't even Cindy Whitmarsh.  Not sure what is going on because the case and the sticker on the DVD says 10 Days to a better body????  Very annoying because now I have to go to UPS 2 times to go out of my way and return this so I do not get charged for the UPS pickup.,1395014400,2,386,3.8607594936708862
3882695,1,B0029Z8K3I,When I put this into my dvd player to use it was not the workout that it says on the cover at all. It's a totally different instructor and program.

3882698,5,B0029Z8K3I,"This is a really cool workout video that contains two segments (upper body and lower body) and each workout really flies by. The interval training is structured so that you do a minute of strength training and then a minute of a cardio drill until the 30 minutes is complete. I enjoyed the weight exercises more than the cardio as I found that a minute of each cardio exercise kinda dragged and was redundant but this was definitely overall a great workout and I'm huffing and puffing through out the entire 30 minutes and feel very satisfied at the end. There are a few specifics that I really like about this video including: great build up to the highest level of each cardio exercise offered. She guides you through a few rounds of a basic low impact cardio variation and then gives you a more high impact advanced variation and lots of encouragement to alternate between these variations. Some of her weight moves were unique and challenged my muscles in new and unfamiliar ways, particularly how she isolates some of the muscles in the arms. This workout flies by quickly and it really does leave me highly satisfied at the end. I don't love the cardio moves but it really feels good to combine cardio and the weights in this specific manner and I can definitely see how this video will get results.",1373760000,,1305,4.605150214592275
3882699,1,B0029Z8K3I,"I feel like I didn't get the same DVD as anyone else. First, I was so angry to find out it was well over a half hour? It was well over 45 minutes. I work, go to school full time, and volunteer so I have VERY little tie to work out. When I schedule a half hour to work out it better freaking only be a half hour. Seriously, that was THE single most annoying part for me.

Also, the so called leg work outs that are going to get us those ""toned"" legs-JOKE. I don't need to buy a ten dollar DVD to do those. barely a work out at all.

And I would be surprised if I burned over 150 calories. I did the ""level 2"" the whole time and barely sweat at all (Though the last arm segment was more intense because there were push ups).

I mean, I guess this is exactly the type of work out I do when I'm at home and can't make it to the gym. I know how to do these things on my own. I feel like people buy these tapes to be pushed, and she pushed me no harder than I'd push myself. Though, I did like her instruction techniques. She wasn't loud and obnoxious like Jillian (so annoying).

I will say though, Jillian's tapes are amazing. I'm wishing they'll end the moment I start them because they're intense and I know I'm doing what I need to do in order to improve!

Again, I read one review where someone got the wrong tape. I feel like that is what happened to me since my tape is so different than all of the reviews mentioned.

3882700,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I ordered a few videos at the same time.  I got to this one after working out my 'tush' and Cindy is very motivating.  She does this stuff that is HARD at first, but I know that in a couple days things will change.  I worked my 'upper body' yesterday, and yet, I feel it in my whole body today already.  She does a wonderful job at changing things up.  First you do weight stuff, and she talks you through it, also giving helpful information, and then she switches it up to a quick cardio blast.  When you do the cardio stuff, be ready.  Have your water nearby, and challenge yourself.  I was definitely only able to do about have the reps she was at first, and yesterday was my first day at it.

3882702,4,B0029Z8K3I,"This is my first workout featuring Cindy Whitmarsh and it does not disappoint!  This DVD contains two 30 minute workouts, one for upper body and one for the lower body.  You alternate between strength and cardio intervals, each running about a minute.  The cardio portions start out as low impact, then change to high impact though you have the option to keep it low impact if you wish.  I really appreciate this, I have never been a fan of high impact so it's nice that options are given for people like me.

I really like Cindy as an instructor too, she is motivating and fun to work out with.  She does not have any backgrounders exercising with her, but for me that doesn't take away from workout.  She has enough energy and is upbeat enough throughout. The strength exercises are pretty standard, while some might have a slight twist or tempo variation.  The cardio is mostly athletic in nature, and pretty basic, no complicated steps here.  And you have the option to keep it low or bump up the intensity depending on how you feel.  And there is minimal equipment required here, only a couple sets of dumbells are needed, one light pair and one heavy pair. I typically use 5 lbs for my light pair, and 8-10 for my heavier pair. Although I will pull out my 12 pounder for exercises like french press.

I also really like the fact they are split up into two 30 minute workouts.  My time is limited these days and my DVD collection consists of more 20-30 minute workouts than 45-60 minutes.  Gone are the days where you need to work out for an extended period of time to get a great workout.  Not here!

Overall I will give this workout 4 and a half stars.  I would say it's mostly geared for intermediate/advanced exercises.  Beginner exercise would manage okay as long as they kept the weights light and stayed with low impact, though some of the cardio exercises are considerably more advanced.

If you like circuit/interval type workouts, this is a great one to try.  Highly recommended.",1355011200,,1994,4.566197183098591

This isn't quite as hard as something like Insanity but it is a great workout.  Anyone can do it.  If you aren't ready for the full blown deal then Cindy gives you low impact options for the cardio.

I was first introduced to Cindy Whitmarsh through Exercise TV and I think she has such a great attitude and personality.  She is warm and engaging and really makes me feel and stay motivated when the workout gets really tough. Moreover, her cueing is excellent and she explains the moves very well.

This DVD includes 2 interval training workouts - one lower body/cardio, one upper body/cardio.  You alternate 1 minute of a strength training move followed by 1 minute of intense cardio.  Not only does this format keep your heart rate elevated, the one minute intervals make the workout manageable and the time seems to pass quickly; as Cindy reminds you throughout, ""you can do anything for a minute!""  It's so true. Just when I am really feeling cooked, it's time to move on to the next interval! Cindy offers modifications for the cardio drills so it's great for any fitness level.

Note: I use 5, 8, or 10lb dumbells depending on the move being performed at the time. Sometimes I'll start off with a heavier weight and move to a lighter one when I am no longer able to perform the move with good form at that weight.",1326412800,3,1232,4.572727272727272
3882707,4,B0029Z8K3I,"I have several fitness DVDs and work out nearly every day.  I've done a few of the Firm's (Allie and Allison) and Jillian's.  This one is probably my favorite DVD that combines weight training and cardio intervals.  It's fun, challenging, and I love Cindy's delivery!
She uses interval training with one minute of strength followed by one minute of cardio.  This means she had a huge variety of moves so it is impossible to get bored.  I did both workouts back-to-back and the time flew by!  I consider myself in very good shape, and this workout was humbling.  For the first time EVER I did pushups on my knees because my deltoids need the break.  With so many different sequences Cindy hits all of the muscles.  It's been a long time since I woke up sore, but this DVD did it for me!
The cueing is excellent.  She'll show low-impact versions then take it up with higher impact moves.  Plus, unlike many exercise DVDs all of the steps are really simple to follow:  no complicated dance-type steps.
The one drawback is that I would have liked a longer stretching section at the end.  I like to stretch a lot after a workout, and the short segment here just didn't do it for me.  Despite that, this is an excellent addition to anyone's collection.  The moves are really simple to catch onto so beginners can enjoy it without frustration.  Advanced exercisers can use heavier weights and attempt the high impact moves Cindy demonstrates.  I prefer it to the Firm because the moves are less complicated and I like the one minute switches over the lengthier intervals in those DVDs.  It's like reading a good book with really short chapters:  you just don't want to put it down!  I like it better than Jillian's because she seems to waste a lot of time talking and I don't feel like I get a good workout.  With Cindy I'm constantly moving and keeping my heartrate up.  Plus, Cindy is really encouraging and motivational.",1306022400,4,1916,4.589970501474927
3882708,4,B0029Z8K3I,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

This is my first workout with this instructor.  Generally, I liked her a lot, but the major con to this DVD for me is that she talked almost non-stop.  I found myself wishing she would not talk so much and let me concentrate on pushing hard thru the workout instead of concentrating on ignoring what she was saying so I wouldn't start to get annoyed.

I realize some people are bored by silence or need distraction or rah-rah motivation but that is not for me and I don't know how people can stand to hear the exact same things again and again and again each time you do the workout.

I prefer cuing, tips on form, occasional motivation when things are toughest, and music/instructor silence or a steady count by instructor.  That's it.  If they want to chat about what kinds of exercises work best, what to eat, lifestyle tips, etc. they should put that in a extras segment of the DVD for you to get to know the instructor, learn about health, the workout moves, get some motivation but not have to be a captive audience to the same conversation again and again each time you work out.  It becomes a punishment more than a motivation.

This was really borderline for me but I liked the workout a lot and will probably tough out the chatter again.  I usually don't like DVD options for music only (which this doesn't have) since I want the cues for the moves and there is rarely an option for cues and music (I think P90X is one of the few that has it.)

Rant aside, this was a very good workout --- I sweated buckets.  While tough, it was still doable since you do one minute intervals alternating between weights and cardio.  The music was rather standard elevator-land but it was audible with a good beat that helped you keep time with the pace of the moves.  That is my minimum requirement for workout music and anything else --- like music that actually appeals or motivates me --- is gravy (and very rare, at that.)",1302307200,,1977,4.4404432132963985

3882710,5,B0029Z8K3I,This a very effective workout DVD and the instructor is great a cuing.  There are two workouts and they are time effective. I recommend this workout.,1292198400,2,149,4.730769230769231
3882711,5,B0029Z8K3I,This is a wonderful well rounded workout DVD. This is now one of my favorites. I like to combine cardio and weights to keep my heart rate up and this does a great job of that. Both the upper body and lower body segments are well rounded to work a good combinations and the cardio segments are challenging. I would say I am an advanced level of fitness and this fits in great to my workout routine.,1277164800,2,397,4.1688311688311686
3882712,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I own about 50 exercise DVDs and this one is definitely one of my faves. It has one 30 minute workout focused on upper body & abs and the other focused on lower body and abs. The best workout I've ever gotten in 30 minutes flat and I definitely saw results in 10 days just like it promised.
Plus the instructor is informative and not at all irritating. =)",1274227200,8,355,4.159420289855072
3882713,4,B0029Z8K3I,"The workouts on this DVD are great! I really work up a good sweat and get my heart rate up.  I typically do both workouts together as one long routine for the most intense workout. One on it's own wasn't quite enough for me.  However for a beginner I think alternating the 2 workouts, one per day doing a different one each day would be quite sufficient.  Just since using both workouts as one every other day (and on the off days doing cardio only) I have actually lost 3 lbs and this is just my first week!  And I have been at a bit of a plateau in my weight loss for about 3 months!  After losing 66lbs and getting very close to goal things slowed wayyyyy down, and I was looking for something to help me breakthru so I can continue towards my goal, and this seems to fit the ticket!  So I have only done it 3 times(maybe it would count as 6 since I have done them both 3 times haha!).  I bought this to add a little variety to my routine of mostly Jillian Michael's dvds, I love her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism DVD it's an amazing cardio workout!  And it's the one I rotate with my 10 days to a Better Body DVD.

The trainer Cindy Whitmarsh is not my cup of tea at all! I don't like peppy, and no I do no think ""push ups are awesome!""  She is almost sing-songy during the workout and doesn't really give the push or motivation I am used to with Jillian.  At one point she even says something along the lines of ""I'm not going to push you, you know your comfort level.""  In any event the workout is pretty friggin great which is all that matters :) I simply mute her and listen to some good tunes!  Don't not buy this one just because of the trainer.  It is WELL worth it for the workout!  Make sure you have 2 sets of weights, a light one and a heavier one.  I use 5lb and 10 lb weights, but it is totally up to you.

If you're looking for a good hard workout that will have you sweating this is an excellent addition to your workouts!",1273881600,5,1939,4.047244094488189
3882714,4,B0029Z8K3I,"It's rare I buy a workout DVD for the results it touts.  Therefore, when I bought this DVD, I had no intention of following the meal plan nor did I have expectations of having a better body in 10 days.  My impetus for purchasing this was to add a low impact, interval training DVD to my library to keep the mix interesting as I primarily workout at home.

That said, I really like this workout. I do both segements at a time for a 60 minute total body workout and received quite a calorie burn, so said my heart rate monitor.  Cindy leads you through 1 minute intervals of cardio/strength training using 2 sets of weights.  She always starts the cardio interval with the beginner modification and moves on to the higher intensity version to finish out the interval.  The strength training moves are straight forward and effective as well.  However, I feel her plank sequences are geared more toward an intermediate/advanced exerciser.  They are challenging, in a good way, and something one could work towards accomplishing. The plank exercises could easily modified to an upright position or a knee-plank position at a slower pace for a beginner exerciser.

Overall, this is a good workout.  The set is a repeat (as seen in other workout DVDs), the music is perfectly fine, and the instructor is affable, motivating, and cues well.  Try it, you may like it.",1267488000,4,1358,4.711864406779661
3882715,5,B0029Z8K3I,"I'm an avid video exercise junkie.  I have my ""cornerstone program"" (Beachbody's Slim in Six), but I also like to switch it up throughout the week.  I'll hit Jillian, Jari Love, Tony Horton, all depending on my mood.  Last week, I started 10 Days to a Better Body.  I normally like a longer workout, but this one really works!  I'm a klutz, so I truly appreciate Cindy Whitmarsh's perfect cueing- along with her focus on balance poses during the strength portions of the workout.  Since it's such a short workout, I've been adding 30 minutes of treadmill work at the end.  The little meal plan that was included in the video is also very good.  I recommend this video for anyone (in any shape, at any age) looking for a solid program that can be used daily to improve overall physical health.",1266969600,2,792,4.528169014084507
3882716,1,B0029Z8K3I,I actually received a different video by a different insturctor encased in the 10 Days to a Better Body case so I was quite disappointed.  I was expecting the video to have two 30 minute routines and the one I received called Boost Your Metabolism was a 50 minute video workout.,1265760000,2,278,4.450980392156863
3882717,5,B0029Z8K3I,"Cindy Whitmarsh does a good job with her instruction, very pleasant and encouraging, definitely not strident or sharp.  She gives instructions for a low impact routine and then a stepped up version which will get your heart rate going even more.  This is really good for folks who have knee problems as I do or who are not yet up to more high energy routines.  The video is divided into 2 segments, one for upper body, the other for lower body with each segment done in one minute intervals of exercise then cardio. As Cindy says ""you can do anything for a minute!""  Each segment runs about 35 minutes including a warmup and cool down with stretching.  The idea is to alternate routines so you don't get bored doing the same thing every time.  I've done the routines for a few days now and really like this DVD. I think it will help me accomplish my goal of getting more targeted exercise along with cardio benefits.",1265500800,3,916,4.4879518072289155
3882718,5,B0029Z8K3I,Cindy is an excellent instructor.  Cindy's precise cueing made it easy and fun to follow along with her. The interval circuits kept me moving and motivated.,1264982400,,156,5.0
3882719,5,B0029Z8K3I,"The instructor is excellent, keeps the pace moving, and makes it fun.  A strenuous interval training dvd, 2 30 minutes sessions that work the entire body. Since the cardio interals are normally only 1 minute long, you have plenty of time to catch your breath during the strength/sculpting exercises.  Requires as much or more energy than ""Banish Fat,Boost Metabolism"" - Jillian Michaels, and seems to be a lot easier on the joints. For the beginner, less strenuous forms of the exercise are shown.  I bought it from Amazon, item arrived early (on 1-20-2010) and was exactly as advertised.",1264636800,4,588,4.979591836734694
3882720,5,B0029Z8K3I,"This is a great vidio.  I love that shee get s right to the point and uses every bit of each 30 minute upper and lower portion burning fat!  I love the way she cues, stays focused and keeps me focused on my goal.  This one of my all time favorite videos and I have only had it for a few weeks.  My old favorites are the Tammilee Webb- Buns of Steel 3 and Denise Austin- SizzleThey are old tapes and I needed a DVD that was comparable to those.  Well...I found it with 10 Days to a Better Body!",1263772800,2,493,3.89
3882721,5,B0029Z8K3I,"If you are someone who is bored easily (like I am) you may love this workout as much as I do. Cindy gives great direction, has good upbeat and offers two excellent 35 min workouts. She always starts with a modification then after about 4 repetitions changes to a higher intensity move, so really anyone should be able to (mostly) complete the workouts. They consist of one upper and one lower body workout that are made up of 1 minute intervals of cardio and strength training - amazingly without being repetitive. There are a few harder moves that I haven't ""graduated"" to, but she's good with the encouragement and helps me feel that I'll get there eventually.

I do not like to exercise. But it's easy for me to get into these workouts. Mostly because I don't get bored, Cindy is positive without getting annoying, you can tell she's getting a good workout in herself and doesn't have too much extra breath to talk about nonsense. Regardless of how much I work out and how tired I am at the end of a workout, I don't seem to be very sore the following day. This is probably because of the great cardio intervals that keep the blood pumping.

Like many people, I've been on again/off again with my exercise and have been known to stop working out for weeks (or months) and somehow this DVD helps me get back on track since I know I will get results quickly and won't be overwhelmed.

Out of dozens of workout DVDs and equipment I've collected over the years, I keep going back to this one. This is the best!",1263686400,5,1509,4.44043321299639
8358702,5,B0029Z8K3I,"This morning was my day 2 workout (before getting ready for work) and while I don't especially LOVE to exercise, I do it so I don't gain weight and stay healthy.  This is my first Cindy Whitmarsh DVD and I really like it.  She has some really good exercises that you don't see in other workouts, to target the problem areas.  I like the fact that she doesn't act like a drill sergeant and is just down to earth motivating your through it by saying ""you can do anything for 1 minute"".  I also like the fact that you're switching off with cardio for one minute and then a weight exercise for one minute.  Trust me you DO feel that one minute!  It's also nice because she'll start a cardio that is more low impact but then also show you a higher impact move for those that are ready to challenge themselves a bit and bump it up.  I heard that this DVD is the same as another one being sold (same title just different person on cover) and yet this DVD is cheaper!  So that was a bonus for me!  After doing the upper body yesterday morning, I started feeling it towards the end of the day.  I'm sure at the end of today I'll feel the lower body workout because it was equally as good.  She recommends that you alternate between the two workouts each day for 10 days as well as eating right.  She does provide a meal plan booklet within the DVD, but I already know how to eat healthy and I've been a Weight Watcher Lifetime member for about 11 years now.  I'm definitely looking forward to getting more toned with these different moves!",1502928000,,1530,4.252595155709343
