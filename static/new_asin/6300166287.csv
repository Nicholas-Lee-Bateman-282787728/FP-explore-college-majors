Includes Marisa Hargitay, JoAnn Willette and of course Courtney Thorne Smith before they were famous.",1523923200,,249,5.048780487804878
7804448,5,6300166287,"Ohmygoodness!  This is definitely a budget made movie and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT! Courtney Thorne-Smith was sweet, Mariska Hargitay was great, and my ABSOLUTE FAVE was Joann Willette! She just stole the show!!! This movie was an all time favorite in my teen years, and now that I have teenagers, they watch it too! It's something I would buy again if I could get it on DVD!",1466899200,3,377,4.463768115942029

7804450,4,6300166287,"As a 90's high school girl, I remember watching this movie and I seriously wanted to do the road trip thing these girls did when my friends and I graduated from high school. Of course we never did what these girls did, but we had some pretty good adventures while still in high school.  I would say this movie is a template for the potential situations that could happen to some friends if they aren't wise to the reality of life after high school. Good times!",1412121600,4,460,4.348837209302325

7804452,1,6300166287,"This movie is terrible. From what I gather it was never even released. I happened to be shown this by what I thought was a friend. He picked up the VHS tape in a trash bin - should have been a hint. Well, that was 91 minutes of my life wasted. Uggh. The soundtrack is really bad. Marisa and Courtney try to the best they can with a crappy script and even worse co-actress. The story goes nowhere and you just don't really care what happens. Watching that one actress dance around with lipstick and some stupid wig made me cringe. She gives a creepy little troll vibe. I guess this was made in the 80's when anyone thought they could make a movie on the cheap and pump it to the public. This one is so bad, they couldn't apparently get anyone to even release it. Don't waste your time.

Update:  This movie was shelved and never released.  And after watching it, I found out for good reason.  The film is a bore particularly due to Willette's terrible acting.  No wonder everyone but Willette turned out famous in this film.  Whoever wrote that they rented and watched it 100s of times growing up is a liar.  The film was never released as it was deemed a failure and not worthy of making any money.  It didn't even make it ""straight to video.""  There are a few post production copies that aren't well edited floating around, but that is about it.  Not even redbox wants this boring film and they'll sell any crap that they can.  The owner of the film has given the rights to his wife who has decided to permanently shelf it and never allow it to be release as it is not artistically important or able to generate any income on it.  Want a film to be a failure, then put Willette in it. It is amazing how talented and famous everyone but Willette is.  Too bad.  Another taller, more beautiful, better talented, and model-like actress could have made the film decent. The glowing ""reviews"" you see are written by the troll looking Willette and a creepy New Jersey tour guide named Baron.  They wanted the film to be released in a desperate attempt to try to make some $$$ and get a career going (a very obviously immature, desperate, and ill-fated attempt as Willette is basically one grade above an orderly changing bed pans in a hospital and Baron is still a New Jersey tour guide) and tried to start some buzz about it, but the owner has said no. He doesn't even want his name affiliated with it due to the embarrassment of this piece of crap.  Save your money and find another movie.  This one is a waste of time and money.",1374883200,,2525,4.349680170575693

7804455,5,6300166287,"Great fun! Classic 80's teen movie. Long before I dated top actresses, had #1 hits and became a friend to nearly every star from Hollywood to London, I used my birth name to write a song for this film. Great memories. Fun for young teen and adults too ;-) Michael Penn does a tune on the soundtrack with his old band as well.
