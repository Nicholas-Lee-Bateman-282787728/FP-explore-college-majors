4980603,5,B0069R250G,"I don't think its very fair to rate a Dvd 1 star simply because season 2 wasn't as good as the first. Superjail's second season may have not been as good as the 1st but nonetheless you can't buy this Dvd not knowing what you're getting into.
The series stays true with its humorous gore and chaotic scenes and even explains more into some of the characters history. There are plenty of episodes and even extra goodies to keep you entertained. Personally I find episode commentary and the animatics to be worth totally worth it just to see what goes on in the head's of the creators and behind the scenes, but hey, thats just me. If you're a fan of Superjail I would suggest you pick this up. If you are not familiar with the second season and are hesitant to buy this, then please watch an episode or two online first, just to see if it fits your taste.",1333238400,23,853,4.304347826086956
4980604,5,B0069R250G,"Not as ""fresh"" as the first season, but still just as original. Depending on your taste, this is either artfully comical or vulgar blood and gore.",1332720000,12,146,4.653846153846154
4980605,1,B0069R250G,The show was less about story and more about just plain psychedelic crazy fun. With a lame storyline season 2 lacks the luster to keep me interested. The animation is not as jaw dropping as before. There was so much going on you could watch the short episodes over and over to see things you never caught before. This is not the case with the second season unfortunatly. As a huge animation fan this was my favorite show on Adult Swim besides Drinky Crow. But alas all good things come to an end!,1332288000,7,496,4.344086021505376
4980606,1,B0069R250G,"""I am a fan of SuperJail"".  I was able to say this without qualification until yesterday when I viewed season two...now I am a fan of ""SuperJail: Season One"".  I think the show has divided itself into two very different experiences, I'll explain:

With the first season, if you liked the magical and  weird fourth dimensional trips, omnipotent/pathetic  Warden, AMBIGUOUSLY (very important for humor) transsexual Alice, violent yet still cartoony and unreal all-out mayhem sequences, ""yellow submarine"" psychedelic  animation, complicated backgrounds and brilliant transition sequences...you will be completely angered and disappointed by the lack of these aspects in the second season.

The animation stinks.  There is no love, no originality as there was in the first season with Augenblick Studios, to which the show owes its success.  The new studio tries to copy the first season on a budget...cheap, uninspired, the colors are muted, the backgrounds boring, and the characters are LIFELESS and horribly drawn.

The writing in the first season was inspired compared to the second.  There were original and clever lampoons of society, religion and sex..the second season is derivative and lackluster, and the visually stunning apocalypse endings are gone...I miss them.

If someone had told me all this, I might not have believed it could have gone so wrong, but I really wish I hadn't wasted any money on this failed attempt at plagerism by Titmouse Studios.

R.I.P. SuperJail...we had a beautiful first season together.

EDIT: Another ""reviewer"" draws a comparison between SJ and Aqua Teens seasonal changes.  ATHF's story arc development is not at all comparable to the issues I have with Superjail.  With the exception of increasingly pointless violence, ATHF was, in its writing, artistic rendition, and animation EXACTLY the same throughout.

Superjail has become more REALISTICALLY violent and macabre, and the characters have changed (ie: The Warden is no longer a god, he is beat up by inmates and bullied by neighbors , Jailbot is just a sheetmetal appliance, and Alice IS A MAN...no more fun guessing about steroid abuse or a thyroid condition, the lumpy mess in her skirt is male genitalia...how boring.)  But none of this, though disappointing, is my real issue here, the creators are in charge, not the fans, and I'm willing to go where they take me.

It's the art that's gone...I can't convince people about this, you either see it or you don't.  For some, the first season was about a unique artistic brilliance, for others it was about cursing and violence...the latter won't notice the differences as long as cartoon inmates are getting ripped apart.  I think this show is just about done...guess we'll see if going cheap on the animation and pandering to the lowest denominator pays off.",1332115200,15,2810,5.172566371681416

A more developed storyline was necessary for the show to continue on without it maintaining it's very erratic progression in story telling.

4980646,5,B0069R250G,"I had bought season one of Superjail on a whim because I had heard an awful lot about it, and had loved it. I don't think any other animated series had made me laugh so much! Based on some of the reviews however, I was reluctant to buy the second season as several fans had said these episodes didn't feel as 'natural' or 'fresh' as the first 10 did. At the first episode of the new season you can indeed spot the difference in animation (it's somewhat smoother), but I didn't see a loss to the artistic 'crudeness' that makes the series so visually appealing. In fact, I thought the slight adjustment to the animation actually suited the constant motions of the characters favorably.

I get the impression that the one star reviewers on this season are a tad prudish. Regardless if the Superjail series took in new writers, new studio, whatever petty complaint you have etc., I didn't notice a change for the worse at all. Season two was another well accomplished bout of colorful macabre fun, and I'm looking forward to more!",1338163200,,1027,4.581521739130435

The whole thing doesn't feel right, all the parts that you love from season one are gone and replaced with predictable mutilations and blood. Did anybody notice in the episode ""Superjail Grandprix"" the italian guy that has no hands (at that point)suddenly he has hands while praying when falling from the warden's car almost at the end of the episode??, if the studio didn't notice that, means that they are not paying attention to what they are doing, that was the success of the first season (attention to detail).
