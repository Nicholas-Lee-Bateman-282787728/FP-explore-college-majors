8287557,5,B001CFQNVM,"Black Lagoon is a really good series.  My friend had shown me the intro, and that was enough to get me hooked.  I'll skip the plot synopsis, because if you're thinking about buying the third DVD chances are you're already familiar with the series.

The DVD's video quality is great, though at times you can see where the anime production team cut corners while animating.  For example, at times when you look into the background of the scene, the peoples' faces do not always look that good.  It should be noted however that issues like this are found in just about any anime series nowadays.  Thankfully, the main characters are always drawn in good form.

Overall, its a great buy if you're looking for action.  One caveat however: The English Dub has a lot more swearing than the Japanese audio w/English subtitles.  Then again, this shouldn't be a problem, given the graphic nature of this show, its probably not for little kids in the first place.

While this anime may not be super realistic, I think thats a plus.  We're looking for entertainment here, not a documentary.  Black Lagoon has great characters and interesting plot lines, so sit back and enjoy!",1229731200,2,1164,4.736318407960199
8287558,5,B001CFQNVM,"The Lagoon crew resolves their battle with mad-dog-assasin-cum-domestic/bodyguard Roberta and move on to a more topical enemy in the ""Protectors of the Islamic Front""... headlined by a fairly stereotypical Ibraha and the really rather refreshing Masahiro Tanenaka.

A hardened terrorist for hire and professional guerilla/spy, Tanenaka-san is alternately more frightening and more likable than his fanatical compatriot. A product of the Japanese Red Army movement, Tanenaka-san is very much a musingly content salaryman cutout with a coldly reasoned motive that makes it very hard to hate him, despite his associations and actions.

A few new characters on the side of the angels, as it were... sort of... mostly... show up in the form of Shenhua and Leigharch, a taiwanese blademistress with comical speech patterns and an irish wheelman with a penchant for drugs that only make him drive better (I swear officer, I'm an excellent driver when I'm plastered. Much more careful to obey the traffic laws!). They provide much of the comic relief for the end of season arc, especially in Shenhua's interactions with Revy and their competition in the finale's chase scene.

The action is, of course, over the top... with Roberta and Revy's duel being almost superhuman in nature and scope along the docks and Shenhua's long range decapitation swings garnering a lot of morbid laughter. Still, a little (lot) of social commentary manages to slide in via Tanenaka's journey and his conversations with Rock.

I think I have to point out here that Black Lagoon has created the single most interesting and likable group of ne'erdowells and mafioso I have ever seen. Be it Chang's triads, Balalaika's Hotel Moscow, Garcia's family, the Nun's with Guns... etc. The Sopranos, the Corleones, even their anime compatriots the Millenion Group and the Universal Criminal Syndicate (to name a few recent entries) don't hold a candle. The theme of Noble Thieves runs heavily, even as they lie, cheat, steal, and murder all those who oppose them in their pursuit of the business of vice. It certainly doesn't hurt that there're even more vicious villains out to destroy these Nobles, but for the most part our antiheros always come through in the end... with casualties only seeming to come from faceless redshirts in the various organizations.

Art and pacing are pretty much spot on with only a few sleepy moments here and there with Garcia and, later, Tanenaka's musings. I most certainly recommend a buy, and hope you move on to the Second Barrage with the creepiest set of twins ever put to celluloid.",1228176000,,2586,5.1040189125295505
8287559,1,B001CFQNVM,"Black Lagoon had a promising start, but by this installment, the whole thing has become unbelievably formulaic and predictable.

I was hoping the ""Maid From Hell"" thing would be interesting, but it all  boils down to people shooting madly at each other, bullets flying all over the place, but no one getting hit by them. Specially not the Maid, or any of the Black Lagoon crew.

Why couldn't Dutch shoot the Maid in the face, when it seemed so easy during the car chase? The answer obviously is that the creaters wanted a showdown between Revy and the Maid.

I was hoping this showdown would be something worthwhile, but it again degenerates to a ""Can't shoot the barn from the inside"" encounter.

Another gripe, why in the world can the Maid run as fast as a car? Perhaps she should take part in the next Olympics. Usain Bolt you better watch out.",1226793600,,848,4.552631578947368
