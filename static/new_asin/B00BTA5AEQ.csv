5671519,5,B00BTA5AEQ,It was bloody brilliant the  best part I think was when  mystery Inc discovered that they were the heart of the jaugar  my son and me loved it spending hours late into the night trying to deciepher  the clues oh sorry that's lost,1373760000,,229,4.255813953488372
5671520,5,B00BTA5AEQ,This is a fantastically witty and detailed extension of the scooby doo universe. My husband and I enjoyed it as much if not more than our son.,1373760000,,142,4.296296296296297
5671521,5,B00BTA5AEQ,I'm a cartoon junkie and have watched Scooby-Doo since I was a kid. Sheriff Stone (Patrick Warburton) is a great satiric piece of work. Lots of crazy characters and much more sophisticated than the old ones. Hope the series ending is a promise of things to come.,1373673600,,262,4.595744680851064
5671522,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"Enjoyed by the entire family!
We spent many hours of happily watching the Scooby and the gang solve the mystery!",1373328000,,112,4.65
5671523,4,B00BTA5AEQ,"Much to the dismay of his many fans, ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" has come to an end. It's pretty evident Cartoon Network didn't know what to do with the series. It started out airing once a week in an evening slot. There were long gaps in between the seasons. When it did return after a long hiatus, the network shoved the rest of the episodes into one week in what appeared to be an attempt to get the whole affair over with as quickly as possible.

""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Season Two Part 2: Spooky Stampede"" collects the last 13 episodes of this highly acclaimed series. I admit it's definitely different from the other shows featuring everybody's favorite crime solving canine. There are way more adult-oriented jokes and witty pop culture nods and winks that most children of the 2000s won't pick up on. However, I still feel it has elements which would appeal to a younger demographic. What's not to like about a Great Dane and his gang of mystery solvers facing off against a different monster every week?

In the second half of Season Two, Scooby and the gang continue to try and solve the mystery of the Planispheric Disc. As they uncover the secrets surrounding the different pieces of the artifact, new crimes come up that need to be solved. Each clue they uncover along the way gets them closer to the truth behind the mystical Disc.

""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" is obviously a prequel to ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"" Not to give away too much, but they're shown heading out of their hometown of Crystal Cove in the Mystery Machine as the series closes. This leaves the viewer with the feeling that you could put the original 1969 show in your DVD player and the two would fit seamlessly together.

After 52 episodes, you'd think we could get some type of extra features for the final episodes of ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated."" How can there not be any footage of the voice actors recording their parts or animators doing what they do? Couldn't they get the producers, director, or any of the cast members to record commentary for a few of the episodes? We get nothing here but some promotional clips for other Scooby-Doo DVDs, Zoink Points, and LEGO Batman.

""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Season Two Part 2: Spooky Stampede"" is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of the Great Dane's adventures or Hanna-Barbera enthusiasts. The monsters are scary and the mysteries will keep kids wondering who the bad guy in the mask is while laughing at the same time. Fans of all things Hanna-Barbera will love it because it incorporates classic characters from the animation studio's colorful past such as Dr. Benton Quest and Roger ""Race"" Bannon from ""Johnny Quest"" and Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon.",1372204800,14,2745,4.844349680170576
5671524,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated: Spooky Stampede contains the final thirteen episodes of this amazing series.  And it is all entirely spectacular. I've been a Scooby fan for as long as I can remember, and this is the best of them all.
This series is easily the best Scooby-Doo show to ever be made. It is also, in my opinion, possibly the best cartoon in existence, as it has several plots running concurrently, extremely good humor, wonderful and continuing character development, and best of all the monster is real again as it was in Zombie Island.
The first episode on the set, ""Heart of Evil,"" is a personal favorite, because it is all about a Batman-inspired rendition of the Blue Falcon, and the episode itself is quite good and humorous because Dyno Mutt is exactly like his old self!  the final six episodes of the set are where this series really shines, however, for it has superior story telling, ideas, amazing voice acting, great visuals and wonderful animation compared to any other cartoon.
I'm not about to spoil anything about the series finale because it literally left me speechless for a while after I saw it on Cartoon Network for the first time, and I must say that was one of the only times my mind was totally and completely blown by a cartoon. The final few minutes of the show are definitely something that the series has been leading to since it's first episode, and it is quite possibly the best moment of the entire series.
Buy this set. Buy all the sets of this series.  It's the best cartoon ever, in my opinion, and it would be a shame if anyone were to miss out on any of it.  The only problem is that there aren't any special features. But that's not why I bought it.",1371600000,11,1703,4.537459283387622
5671525,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"The last 13 episodes of the series are the best. I kinda have to put some spoilers, though.

40. Heart of Evil - Business with Destroido brings the presence of some other earlier Hanna-Barbera characters, with some parodies of Batman.

41. Theater of Doom - After production for a play about Crystal Cove is haunted by a real ghost, Vincent Van Ghoul helps the gang put on their own musical version.

42. Aliens Among Us - Sheriff Stone tells the gang of his own alien abduction (which, of course, isn't real). With the help of the Planispheric Disk, the gang discovers the ""First Key"".

43. The Horrible Herd - Professor Pericles mutates a herd of cattle (with piranhas and bees), which start to ravage Crystal Cove. They injure Nova (Scooby's dog girlfriend), and escape to the rest of the world.

44. Dance of the Undead - A zombie band takes control of most of Crystal Cove, forcing them all to dance. The Hex Girls (in their second appearance) helps the gang locate the ""Second Key"" after which Nova (in a coma at the hospital) prophesies of Nibiru. This episode is very much like ""Where Walks Aphrodite"" from the first season.

45. The Devouring - Sheriff Stone's friend (who is basically Paula Deen) is eaten on her cooking show by the ""Gluten Demon"", a legendary monster that haunts unhealthy chefs. This is the second appearance of hunter Rick Spartan and his servant Cachinga, after ""Attack of the Headless Horror"". The gang finds the ""Third Key"".

46. Stand and Deliver - A man calling himself the Dandy Highwayman steals away most of the women in Crystal Cove. The gang finds the ""Fourth Key"", and Scooby learns in a dream of Nova's speaking ability (she isn't Nova, she's an Anunnaki, an interdimensional alien possessing Nova's body), and that Scooby has to destroy the demon beneath Crystal Cove.

47. The Man in the Mirror - Another Fred is trying to find the Planispheric Disk with the gang (which the real Fred hid) while the real Fred (along with an aged Daphne) is looking for it in a decimated Crystal Cove. Professor Pericles gets hold of the complete Planispheric Disk.

48. Nightmare in Red - When Scooby has dreams of a more hideous Freak of Crystal Cove, the gang visits a hypnotist (who was also in Scooby's dreams) to help. He sends them all into a dream, in which Nova tells them of the Heart of the Jaguar, a spear that can destroy the demon under Crystal Cove.

49. Dark Night of the Hunters - When Angie Dinkley's (Velma's mom) old boyfriend is captured while looking for the Heart of the Jaguar, Mystery Inc. goes to Mexico to help. They find the Heart, and are escorted back to Crystal Cove with the help of Mayor Nettles.

50. Gates of Gloom - Back in Crystal Cove, the gang finds everyone missing, with something tunneling under town (which is taking everyone). Velma's research reveals that only two days are left until Crystal Cove's demise, after which they find all of Crystal Cove's inhabitants underground. The door to the entity under Crystal Cove is discovered, and both Mystery Incorporateds head inside.

51. Through the Curtain - The demon under Crystal Cove is released by Professor Pericles (with the help of the keys found earlier).

52. Come Undone - Professor Pericles bonds with the demon, and begins eating everyone in Crystal Cove. It summons an army of Anunnaki, which only Scooby can destroy. Once the entity is destroyed, Crystal Cove is reborn, with only the gang (and a different Mr. E.) remembering what happened. Here's all the changes:

- Crystal Cove isn't ""The Hauntedest Place on Earth"" anymore, but ""The Sunniest Place on Earth""
- Fred's fake Dad is Crystal Cove High's principal, while Fred's real parents (the Chiles) are doctors
- Daphne is considered the most accomplished of her family, rather than the least
- Fred and Daphne are going to get married
- Velma and Hot Dog Water are a renowned science fair team
- Shaggy is a renowned teen chef
- the old Mr. E. is married to Angel Dynamite, and, with the help of Professor Pericles, created a company for clean energy
- Sheriff Stone and Mayor Nettles are married with four kids
- Danny Darrow (the weird ""goblin"" from before) helps with an existing Darrow Mansion
- Fred is the most popular person at Crystal Cove High, unlike before

The gang feels out of place, as the new Crystal Cove never had anything to do with mysteries. However, Harlan Ellison (the professor from ""The Shrieking Madness"", based off the author who voices himself on this) remembers the alternate Crystal Cove, and sets them off on mysteries as ""Mr. E."".",1365120000,25,4551,4.706918238993711
5671526,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"i like the episode horrible herd and aliens among us.
the funniest thing was on horrible herd was when the mayor and sherrif stone kissed.
the sad parts on horrible herd was when scoobys girlfriend fell out of the helicopter.",1364169600,8,225,4.65
5671527,5,B00BTA5AEQ,The dvds worked well. Every episode was included everything the product said about it was true that why I rate the product Love it.,1399420800,,131,4.5
5671528,1,B00BTA5AEQ,"""It was so creepy, that I freaked out"".  He wants to share that it gave him nightmares for days.  He had to watch something else to get the images out of his head.  ""I couldn't sleep because it was so bad"".  ""This is definitely creepy, so don't watch it"".",1394409600,2,255,4.142857142857143
5671529,4,B00BTA5AEQ,"This are the last 13 episodes of Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, and while the ending episodes become a bit darker this ties up nicely everything that happened in Crystal Cove and what drove Mystery Inc. to take their ghost hunting on the road. Still a good watch for all ages even with a few of the episodes having a darker tinge to them.",1393372800,2,340,4.5
5671530,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"My kids love this series.  Not quite the same as the original, but close.  They have watched this series several times already.  They love scooby doo.  Hope they can find new story to keep this going.",1388707200,,200,4.472222222222222

5671532,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"We have the whole set, at least the up-to-date seasons. We hope they keep making it and don't Cancel like the networks are so infamous of doing. All the characters are well played now, the best voices of all these years. The stories just keep getting more linked to more upcoming episodes that keep you wanting to see the next and the next. The laughs never run out, the music is great, the villains vary quite a bit. I like that Mr E became the kind of character they ended up evolving him into (don't want to spoil it for anyone) and want to see where the gang goes next. As long as they making Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, we'll keep watching it and keeping our home library stocked with them.
Recommend it to kids of all ages and adults who remain fun and young at heart. Scooby rules !!",1381449600,,795,4.342281879194631
5671533,5,B00BTA5AEQ,Shaggy and Scooby Doo were favorites of my son and now they are favorites of my grandchildren. Not too scary for the little ones and enough of Scooby for the older ones.,1381276800,,169,4.3125
5671534,4,B00BTA5AEQ,"I've always like Scooby-doo and when this latest series came to Cartoon Network I watched every week. I guess season two aired on TV but I couldn't find it. So I picked up the DVDs. The long-term mystery is solved in this DVD set but the real fun is in the individual episodes with traps and all there crazy antics. It would have been nice to get some behind-the-scenes interviews or extras especially with the guest stars like Amy Acker.

Anyway good set for the Scooby-doo fan",1380240000,,478,4.494252873563219
5671535,5,B00BTA5AEQ,"The second season started strong, but these last episodes were not quite as good as season one and early season 2. My son is a huge fan so we enjoyed watching these as a family, but I was a little disappointed as it seemed there were some loose ends and wasted potential. The characters have become like friends so we hope the writers and voice actors collaborate on future projects.",1380067200,,383,4.485714285714286

5671539,4,B00BTA5AEQ,"Well, this is it: the last of the dramatic Cartoon Network series ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated"" is on this 2-disc DVD set.  Join Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne in the final 13 episodes as they tackle the biggest mystery they're about to solve in the town of Crystal Cove.  These adventures include the following:

""Heart of Evil"" - Get this: In this episode, the gang gets to team up with the heroic Blue Falcon and his cybernetic canine sidekick Dynomutt !  (In fact, there's also a recently released movie called ""Scooby-Doo: Mask of the Blue Falcon"" where they meet up again.  Still, I haven't seen the Blue Falcon since his cameo in ""Dexter's Laboratory"".)

""Aliens Among Us"" - Sheriff Bronson Stone (voiced by Patrick Warburton, BTW) claims to have encountered alien creatures, but more importantly, the gang find a very important clue thanks to the Planespheric Disc.

""Dance of the Undead"" - A zombie rock band hypnotizes the citizens of Crystal Cove.  The gang must stop the music with help from The Hex Girls.

""Stand and Deliver"" - A strange fellow named The Dandy Highwayman starts charming - but really kidnapping - women all over town and the gang must stop him fast.  Also, Scooby starts having some strange dreams.

""The Man in the Mirror"" - Fred gets pulled into a mirror and winds up in a devastated Crystal Cove.  Now he has to find a way out before it's too late.

""Gates of Gloom"" - People are disappearing in Crystal Cove by a mysterious force underground.  It's only a matter of time until the fate of the town is sealed unless the gang can stop this madness quickly before the original Mystery Incorporated.

""Come Undone"" - An ancient Evil Entity has been unleashed ravaging everything in its wake.  Once Scooby and the gang finally stopped the demonic being, their lives have forever changed.

As I find the series somewhat less interesting than it started, the Scoob and his friends still have that mystery-solving groove no matter what the situation.  Still, with this series finished, that doesn't mean they have even more mysteries to solve.  Look for that kooky canine and company in new movies and perhaps TV specials, too on the Cartoon Network.",1377475200,,2190,4.807486631016043
