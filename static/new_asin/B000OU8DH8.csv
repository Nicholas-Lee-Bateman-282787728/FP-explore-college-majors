I don't speak much Spanish (though I'm learning, slowly), but that hasn't prevented me from enjoying many of the obscure films that I've discovered in these little stores. This is one of them.

I was drawn to this one mainly because of the presence of the lovely and talented Angela Molina, familiar to me from Bunuel's ""That Obscure Object of Desire."" This was only her second film - she was 20 when she made it, but looks younger, which is appropriate for the role, that of a provincial virgin lured to the big city by a struggling pimp (Jose Sacristan) who wants to spice up his trade with a fresh young 'act.' If that sounds lurid or grotesque (and yeah, I guess it is), the film is not, being largely playful and tender at heart (Sacristan falls for the girl, of course).

The most surprising aspect of this production, though, is that it was directed by none other than Eugenio Martin, the helmer of such genre favorites as ""Horror Express"" (with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee) and ""A Candle for the Devil.""
