7815446,4,6301778251,"Searching for ""old time"" style b/w mysteries on VHS, I am pleased to find this set. The tapes, 2 in package, arrived sooner than expected and were safely wrapped. I'm running this VHS tape on an almost 30-year old player, so I don't know if peculiarities are in the tape on on the player. It's great to see Mantan Moreland again. I have some of his Charlie Chan appearances. He was so talented but rarely showed us all he could do.",1460332800,,431,4.333333333333333
7815447,4,6301778251,"""The Mystery of the Riverboat,"" directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins and released in 1944, has many faults common to Universal's serials of the time, but a good cast and the Louisiana setting help in maintaining interest through its 13 chapters.

The story, written by Ande Lamb, involves swampland near Duval's Landing, where deposits of a high-energy fuel, ""Nitrolene,"" have been discovered by a scientist, Dr. Hartman (Byron Foulger), who signs an agreement with developer Herman Einrich (Ian Wolfe).  After getting the map locating the deposits, Einrich has Hartman killed by his henchman, Cassard (Dick Curtis), and departs for Duval's Landing on the riverboat ""Morning Glory.""  The riverboat's captain, Ethan Perrin (Oscar O'Shea) is one of the landowners involved, and a young attorney, Steve Langtry (Robert Lowery) is investigating Einrich's offer for his father's land.  But three speculators, Rudolph Toller (Lyle Talbot) and his underlings Bruno Bloch and Louis Schaber (Anthony Warde and Joe Devlin) are on the ""Morning Glory"" trying to get Einrich's map.  They are aided by one of the riverboat's entertainers, singer Celeste Eltree (Marion Martin).  There's also a ""mystery man"" called Clayton (Arthur Hohl) and his Cajun associate, Batiste (Francis MacDonald) who are clearly up to no good.  Helping Steve Langtry are the Captain's daughter, Jenny (Marjory Clements), the riverboat's Steward, Napoleon (Mantan Moreland) and entertainer Jug Jenks (Eddie Quillan), the latter two also providing some mostly-restrained comic relief.  In a minor role is Jimmie Dodd, future Mouseketeer, who sings a couple songs but otherwise has the good sense to stay out of the plot, which is already bogged down with too many characters.

There aren't as many fist fights and car chases as would be seen in a Republic serial, but the unusual use of musical and other entertainment on the riverboat helps set the mood and pads out the action in the first few chapters, giving the somewhat complicated plot time to unfold.  We get the usual supply of stock footage and recycled cliffhangers, some providing amusement for those familiar with Universal's serials.  An out-of-control taxi with our hero unconscious inside, crossing several busy streets as it rolls backwards down a steep hill toward the waterfront is less believable in a town in the Louisiana swamps than when it was Seattle in ""Don Winslow of the Coast Guard.""  And when the levee breaks, the citizens of this same town get on their horses to escape before the flood waters rush past the ""Red Gulch Saloon,"" a scene that was not new when used in ""Flaming Frontiers"" in 1938.  Steve Langtry survives unhurt from several cliffhangers without any rational explanation; he's as invincible as the Green Hornet.  And yes, we get some footage of the ""Black Beauty"" in a chapter where Miss Perrin borrows a ""hopped-up"" car.  But none of this seriously affects the plot, which, if often a little weak in logic, moves along without the odd ""detours"" seen in the later chapters of many Universal serials of the era.

Both of the DVD's currently listed on Amazon were sourced from 16mm reduction prints likely made for non-theatrical purposes such as television.  Scratches and dirt flecks are plentiful, many of them seem to be from the negative used to make the copies, a common problem with existing prints of Universal serials, but at least these are not further corrupted with redone titles from later distributors.

The Serial Squadron's edition is now supplied on two single-layer DVD-R discs instead of the ""flippie"" used when it was sold through Hermitage Hill Media.  The image is fairly sharp and has a somewhat less foggy look than VCI's, with good control of black level and contrast, and ""matted"" to show more of the frame.  The opening credits all include the correct MPPDA certificate numbers for the chapters to which they are attached, though these were spliced into the Chapter One credits, with 10281 appearing briefly before and after the correct number, likely done when the reduction prints were made.  But while the Serial Squadron's image is a little better than VCI's, their sound processing leaves a lot to be desired.  The ""hiss"" has been effectively removed by filtering the high frequencies, but they also removed the sound of the ""Nitrolene"" burning in Chapter One, and most of the low frequencies have been cut.  The peaked-up mid-range makes the dialogue quite clear, but at the expense of other sounds and with a tinny, echoy ""megaphone"" quality, which also increases the distortion.  A few chapters have a noticeable ""gurgle"" when the sound is at low levels, likely due to noise blanking.  Worse examples exist, but this kind of processing can hardly be considered an improvement, given the effect on the music.  The Serial Squadron includes the original theatrical trailer as an ""extra"" feature, the picture decent enough but the audio is badly distorted, though this time from the film, not the fault of the video transfer.

VCI's edtion, # 7409 is a bare-bones release in their ""Vault Classics"" series, with no ""extra"" features and issued on a double-layer DVD-R disc, a type which should work on most modern players, especially if the instruction manual lists ""DVD-R DL"" and ""DVD+R DL"" as compatible disc types.  The print source is similar to the one used for their VHS release, # 1702, only they replaced all the opening credits with the relatively scratch-free set from Chapter Three, with MPPDA number 10283, not an especially critical issue given the corrupt nature of the reduction prints.  The image is slightly too large for the frame, slightly trimming the edges of the opening ""recap"" text and credits.  Otherwise, while a bit murkier, the sharpness is nearly as good as the Serial Squadron's, with most details clear enough, fewer scratches and dirt flecks, and correction of some black level issues seen in the VHS tape.  The sound is similar to that of the VHS tape, a little noisy, with some high-frequency ""hiss"" but the flatter frequency response and lack of processing artifacts make it generally preferable to the Serial Squadron's.

I like the framing and image treatment by the Serial Squadron, and the dialogue is clear in their edition, but since the source prints used for both DVD's were far from pristine I'd rather watch VCI's transfer and hear sound that supports the musical content and is free of ""noise reduction"" artifacts.  But either edition gives a decent representation of the serial, and as with any of them it is best watched with a day or more between the chapters.",1405814400,5,6600,5.053456221198156
7815448,4,6301778251,"The Serial Squadron has done it again with this release of the 1944 Universal serial.  While the print is not quite as good as their Tailspin Tommy In The Great Air Mystery, it's still the best print of this serial you're likely ever to see and far better than previous VHS versions.

The serial itself is fun and fairly interesting.  Mantan Moreland is a highlight of it and Robert Lowry, who went on to play Batman in 1949, is always a fun serial hero to watch.

Both the movie and the DVD are very highly recommended.  Here's hoping The Serial Squadron puts out more great DVDs just like this!",1197936000,,596,4.431192660550459
7815449,3,6301778251,"Thanks to Serial Squadron for doing what they can with this fun Universal serial.  This serial is unusual because of the occasional musical numbers!  This is a single flipper disc release.  The format is a little strange in that you can only play one chapter at a time....there is no ""play all"" option.

The print looks like it has been in a ditch for 50 years.  It has a dupey quality with tons of debris and vertical lines on the image.  Of course, I've never seen a better print available for this title.  As with most Universal serials, this one has fallen into the public domain and I doubt that Universal even has the negative preserved.

Despite the quality of the print, this is a fun little serial and I certainly recommend it.  Of course, ANYTHING with Mantan Moreland in the cast is worth a look!",1175212800,9,807,4.472602739726027
