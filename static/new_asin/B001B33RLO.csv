8281615,4,B001B33RLO,"...yes, I gave this 1987 shot-on-video (SOV) slasher 'film' four stars ('I like it'), but that does not reflect its inherent quality. This is an unbelievably BAD movie, even given the lax standards of '80s SOV slasher movies (think ""Spine"" and ""Momma's Home"").

No, my response was more based upon my admittedly guilty penchant for indulging in that peculiar form of schadenfreude one often experiences in the presence of a production so astoundingly inept, so ludicrously awful, so mind-bogglingly moronic on every conceivable level that if one were to encounter such a film nowadays (here in the era of the post-post-modern mainstreaming of irony), you would immediately suspect that it was some kind of elaborate, deliberately crafted put-on.

But no, you can always spot those a mile off (think ""Snakes on a Plane""). ""Streets of Death"" is the genuine article, a true-blue (brown?) piece of cinematic excrement that ranks down there with the likes of ""Manos - The Hands of Fate"" and the oeuvre of Ed Wood, Jr.
