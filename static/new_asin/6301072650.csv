7809249,5,6301072650,"Outside o the two Miss Marple collection sets are three videos that are more of a made for television series. This is one ""A Pocketful of Rye""

Rex Fortescue is out of character as he arrives at is office. You immediately know something is wrong because this is England and Rex has ordered his tea much too early. Yep mean old nasty Rex is found dead. Thorough detectives have determined that there was some mysterious grain in his pocket. If you remember the nursery rime you can follow the story. So how does Jane become involved? She trained the maid and is afraid for her safety. Naturally at several places in the mystery Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) points out the obvious to Det. Sergeant Hay (Jon Glover) who realizes and corrects the error of not listening to her.

There is only one repugnant scene where you have to watch Rex eat. Other than that it is a thoroughly enjoyable mystery.",1501804800,,893,4.575
7809250,4,6301072650,"""A Pocketful of Rye"" (1985) was the forth film in the BBC's first attempt at adapting Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novels for the screen, starring Joan Hickson as the flinty spinster sleuth. Financier Rex Fortescue (Timothy West) dies suddenly at his office, poisoned by taxine, perhaps from the berries on his family estate, Yewtree Lodge. DI Neele (Tom Wilkinson) and DS Hay (Jon Glover) investigate. Miss Mary Dove (Selina Cadell), who manages the household, calls Fortescue ""an odious man."" His young widow Adele (Stacy Dorning) is having an affair with her golf instructor. His estranged younger son Lance (Peter Davison) will arrive from Africa shortly. Rex fought with elder son Percival (Clive Merrison) over the business. When another murder occurs, apparently following the nursery rhyme ""Sing a Song of Sixpence"", Miss Marple becomes concerned that her trainee maid Gladys Martin (Annette Badland), now employed at Yewtree Lodge, is in danger.

This adaptation by screenwriter T.R. Bowen is largely faithful to the book. The character of Gladys, in particular, I found more convincing than the later 2008 adaptation starring Julia McKenzie, which also did not stray far from Christie's work. It's a solid whodunit in an English country home with sniping family members who all have secrets. Christie has used this plot before. Miss Marple is ahead of the police detectives, as usual. But she is not quite as sharp and testy as she sometimes is, and she gets less screen time than usual. I prefer this adaptation to the later attempt, because I like the cast better, and the style feels more authentic. But I wish Miss Marple had been a stronger presence, as Joan Hickson is so good at conveying her intellect and arrogance. This is probably not one of Christie's stronger novels. The film is a solid adaptation, not an exceptional one, with an excellent cast.",1439596800,,1871,5.074675324675325

I watched this movie without reading the 1953 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

This movie begins with a wealthy person dying.  The police, led by Detective Inspector Neele (Tom Wilkinson), are called in to investigate.  Forensics determines that this person was poisoned and it is found that one of the victim's pockets had seed (later determined to be rye) in it.  At this point, a nervous member of the estate that the dead person owned (called ""Yew Tree Lodge"") writes to Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) and tells her of the death.  Miss Marple begins an unofficial investigation but not before two more suspicious deaths occur.

The major clue to these deaths, as Miss Marple determines, is a sixteen line children's nursery rhyme:

Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocketful of rye;
Four and twenty blackbirds,
Baked in a pie.
When the pie was opened,
The birds began to sing;
Wasn't that a dainty dish,
To put before the King?
The King was in the counting house,
Counting out his money;
The Queen was in the Parlor,
Eating bread and honey.
The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes;
When down came a blackbird,
And bit her on the nose.

Eventually, a surprising accidental death occurs.

Who are the people that live at or are associated with this estate?  They are as follows:

1. Rex Fotescue, a London financier and the estate's owner (Tim West)
2. Adele, Rex's young wife (Stacy Dorning)
3. Miss ""Effie"" Henderson, Rex's sister-in-law from his first marriage (Fabia Drake)
4. Vivian Dubois, Adele's ""golf partner"" (Martyne Stanbridge)
5. Percival Fortescue, Rex's son from his first marriage (Clive Merrison)
6. Jennifer, Percival's wife (Rachel Bell)
7. Lance Fortescue, another son of Rex from his first marriage (Peter Davison)
8. Pat, Lance's wife (Francis Low)
9. Mary Dove, housekeeper and supervisor to the staff working at Rex's estate (Selina Cadell)
10. Mrs. Crump, the estate's cook (Merelina Kendall)
11. Mr. Crump, the cook's husband (Frank Mills)
12. Gladys Martin, the estate's maid and Miss Marple's protg (Annette Badland)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance.  (Hickson was 79 years old in this movie!)

The cinematography is visually stunning.  All costumes are authentic looking.  Also, the background music adds to each scene.

Finally, I have noticed in this Miss Marple series that the cassette containers have the wrong still pictures usually on the back of the container.  For this movie's container, however, there is a wrong still picture on the front of the container.  (This picture is from ""Murder at the Vicarage,"" another good Miss Marple murder mystery.)

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!
