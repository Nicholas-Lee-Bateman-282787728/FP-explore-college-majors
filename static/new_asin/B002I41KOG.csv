8370684,2,B002I41KOG,"In 2002, Nick ""Wog Boy"" Giannopolis wrote, stared in and directed ""The Wannabes"" a silly, slapstick comedy about a gang of criminals who pose as a children's entertainment group, with former soap star Isla Fisher in a minor role as his love interest. The film, shot in Melbourne, copped bad reviews at a time when Aussie comedy was not flavour of the month with Australian film reviewers or film goers.

 Fast forward to 2009, Isla Fisher is  a Hollywood star, and the Wannabes has been re-released with a brand new title and cover artwork, marketing Fisher as the star of the film for the benefit of the yanks or anyone else who may have missed the film the first time around. The film isn't as bad as some of the Australian reviews made out. Just. Still, only a fool or a diehard fan of Ms Fisher would consider paying $[...] for this slick piece of marketing. Criminal indeed.",1256169600,8,879,4.550632911392405
