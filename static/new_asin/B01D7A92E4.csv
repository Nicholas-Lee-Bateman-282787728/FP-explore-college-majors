8755138,4,B01D7A92E4,"Director Wim Wenders does not make films for the average movie goer. His films tend to be esoteric. This is one of his most accessible films but it still moves slowly. Its a co-production of Norway and Canadian Producers and takes place in a French speaking province of Canada.. As other reviewers here have said, its about regret and guilt. I really do hate spoilers but since the package reveals that the film starts off with a fatal auto accident (truly an accident cause by weather) and this takes place in first three minutes of the film, I can reveal that. The driver is an up and coming author played by James Franco  at his moodiest (he rarely smiles). He and the other three stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Marie-Josee Croze and Rachel McAdams are fine.  The 2-hour film plays with time and jumps ahead in two to 4 year spurts. While the children obviously age, I did not notice a lot of aging in the other actors. Gainsbourg is riveting whenever she is on the screen and  if I had to choose the one reason I stayed with this film it was to watch her. Personally, I felt that Wenders and, of course, the Norwegian screenplay writer, repeated the theme a bit too often.

The Bluray (and I assume the DVD) has a LOT of bonus content. There are interviews with Wenders and nearly all the cast (Franco is the one not interviewed) in a Q& A format. This, alone, runs over an hour. Then there is the Making of featurette, which is basically 15 minutes of watching them film, with no real narration.

Im glad I watched it for the acting, but I didn't find it very satisfying. Id really give it 3  stars but Ill up it to 4.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
