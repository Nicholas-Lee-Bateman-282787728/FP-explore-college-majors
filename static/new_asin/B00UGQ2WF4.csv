8706263,4,B00UGQ2WF4,"The show on this DVD was originally broadcast as Episode 21 of the German TV musical anthology program BEAT! BEAT! BEAT! on November 13, 1967. The precursor to BEAT CLUB and MUSIK LADEN, BEAT! BEAT! BEAT! showcased a plethora of '60's acts (see below), all live! The source here is definitely 2nd generation or less, with the show's credits, host and ""bumpers"" removed. The individual performances are edits that fade in and out. Filmed in B&W, the picture is clear enough but slightly smeary, especially the backgrounds. Happily the sound is loud and clear. A superior looking grey-area compilation that includes the Lee Dorsey, Arthur Conley and Sam & Dave segments can be found on the release ""Vols. 3 & 4"" (try Stellar Products). THAT compilation also features B!B!B! performances from Julie Driscoll & Brian Auger, Episode Six, The Move, The Smoke, The Yardbirds, Jimi Hendrix, The Hollies, and The Creation !!! The performances found on this DVD include:

""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""You Send Me"" by Linda Carr
'Get Out My Life Woman"" and ""Ride Your Pony"" by Lee Dorsey
""Whole Lotta Woman"" and ""You Send Me"" by Arthur Conley
""Secret Agent Man"" and ""If You Give Up What You Got"" by The Sam & Dave Orchestra
and
""You Don't Know Like I Know,"" ""Soul Man,"" ""When Something Is Wrong With My Baby"" and ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" by Sam & Dave

All are backed by The Sam & Dave Orchestra, which consists of six saxes, a trumpet, trombone, guitar, bass & drums......

There was also a series of BEAT! BEAT! BEAT! DVDs released a few years ago that mostly contained clips by one artist, were very short and not value for money, unless you can find them dirt cheap.......

In addition to the performers listed above, here's a list of some of the other acts to perform on the show: included: The Easybeats, The Searchers, The Sputniks, Tom Jones, Helen Shapiro, Manfred Mann, The Kinks, The Troggs, P.P.Arnold, The Sorrows, The Small Faces, Cat Stevens, Simon Dupree & The Big Sound (pre-Gentle Giant!), The Equals, Paul Jones, Dave Davies, Freddie & The Dreamers, Los Bravos, Alan Price, Georgie Fame, Sandie Shaw, Tony Sheridan, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Spencer Davis Group, Vanity Fair, P.J.Proby, Paul and Barry Ryan, Peter and Gordon, Terry Reid, Geno Washington & The Ramjam Band, The Tremelos, The Foundations, Herman's Hermits, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, The Tages, Chris Farlowe, Eric Burdon & The New Animals, The Monks, The Yardbirds, Madeline Bell, Dave Berry, and Sounds Incorporated, to name a few......",1460505600,,2523,4.8604651162790695
