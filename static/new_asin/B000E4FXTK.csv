2489362,5,B000E4FXTK,"This series is about as ""live"" as you will get without going on board and working the high seas of Alaska during the winter. I myself have worked during the winter on board 2 different vessels both of which were based out of Dutch Harbor AK. And yes, it is very much like this on board these vessels. I have good memories and sad memories of what has happened out on the high seas. There have been many vessels go down out there on the Bering Sea, some of which could have been helped and some of which could not be helped due to weather/storm conditions. I would higly suggest to anyone that wants to know what it takes to work on a vessel in Alaska to watch these series. Just because you might be that perfect person in the gym, doesn't mean you can handle the day on night on day in and day out of the stress and muscles it takes to do this kind of job. I have seen enough of these guys that come to Dutch Harbor in search of ""their gold"", to only last a few days or maybe even one week, to pratically beg on their knees crying like children, to be taken back to land so they can go home-DEAFEATED. Yes, it takes it's toll on a person's soul, mind and spirit to do this sort of work. When the crab are out there the work is happening, 24 hours in a day isn't enough to work when you are losing money when the crab are about. So, before heading off to Alaska because you think you can do this job, better to think about if you can handle working 24 hours awake for sometimes 3 days, and then after that possibly 18 hours a day for 2-3 months, depending on the crab. See the film and then you decide if this job is really for you. Is the money really worth it?

No internet, no mobile phone calls, maybe no TV unless you have pre taped video/dvd programs, rocking and rolling all the time day in and day out, cramped into small bunks in rooms without privacy. Forget your nice clothes, the ones you will wear on this trip will be ruined after one season. So, perhaps you should see these series. I have the whole box set of 1-10 Episodes, if anyone is interested in purchasing them. I can't find the price on amazon for the complete boxed set, but I will sell them to someone who wants them 5 Dvd's 2 episodes per DVD. They are in NEW condtion, played once only. And come shipped First class mail to anywhere in the USA. Contact me if interested",1165795200,4,2347,4.135667396061269
2489363,5,B000E4FXTK,"This riveting series from The Discovery Channel takes viewers inside the fishing industry - really inside. Follow the crews as they battle extreme fatigue from the grueling work, the heartbreak of separation from loved ones, the ruthless elements including the frigid waters of the Bering Sea, for their share of the multi-million dollar Alaskan crab market. I can't wait for the complete series, and I'll never sit down to a crab leg feast again without a prayer for the brave men who brought it in. Five stars? This one's a ten.....",1150848000,12,534,4.8791208791208796

8105704,4,B000E4FXTK,"Supposedly, two pilot episodes were done for what is now known as the TV show Deadliest Catch. This version is narrated by Thom Beers the series creator.  The hour long program presented on this DVD follows the crew of the Fierce Allegience. This is not a glossy high production piece like the TV show, this is raw and gritty. It's a good introduction to the TV show we are all familiar with these days but most importantly it's a good introduction to crab fishing and what these brave men must endure on the Bering Sea. There are segements on the Coast Guard, how crab is delievered to the cannery and packed for shipment and there's a interesting although brief meeting of the entire fleet regarding the price for crab and the fleet asking to be paid fairly for it from the cannery.",1296345600,6,784,4.52112676056338
