While I'm sure I'd love it, I'm a 43 year old father of two with a job and the harsh reality is that my busy lifestyle has made me cut way back on cartoons. (Though I'm typically more into the ones where anvils fall on Coyote.) My kids seem to have spent some time on Amazon Prime checking out Cyberchase. I think you should think about truing up those algorithms to figure out which review solicitations do and do not apply to me.",1368748800,,561,4.252336448598131
