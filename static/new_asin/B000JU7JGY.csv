2679390,5,B000JU7JGY,"It reminds me of the memory I've had since my earliest childhood.  The one where the answer to a revolving puzzle is inside of me, yet strangely beyond my grasp. Although life as a child seems to be endless, from my very beginning I somehow sensed its ending.  The nagging question invariably follows: What is the most important thing to me, and how shall I protect it after I'm gone? This seems to be the primary theme of this particular story. Sometimes the answer comes from a chance encounter, such as occured in this film. I like it very much. All of the acting seemed real.  Maybe it's because I believe in miracles.  Buy it for one of those gray days, when the clouds supply a suprising ray of much needed hope and sunshine.  Down Pat",1202774400,,741,4.419117647058823
8153150,4,B000JU7JGY,"Stellar performance by Nancy Travis. I'm used to only seeing Nancy in comedy like The Bill Engvall Show or Last Man Standing, so it was interesting to see a different side to her and her performance was astounding. I watched it twice. The story tends to get boring towards the end, but the first 2/3 of the movie was entertaining.",1473120000,,330,4.516666666666667
8153151,4,B000JU7JGY,"This is a simple heartfelt touching story. I really enjoyed it because it was real. I thought the chemistry between Nancy and Scott was quite believable. It was a library dvd, never heard of it before. I was hoping to buy a copy on amazon",1459123200,,238,4.311111111111111

8153155,5,B000JU7JGY,"I have been a fan of Nancy Travis for a long time (since The Vanishing), and in my opinion this is one of her best performances.  The entire cast did a great job.  The movie seemed real ... the acting seemed so real.  There is something special about this movie ... it takes hold of me each time I see it.  People who experience the kind of real love that is portrayed in this movie are very fortunate.  It is not something that happens that often in a person's life ... sometimes people never experience this kind of love.  Once again, the actors did a wonderful job making everything real, and I highly recommend this movie.",1399852800,,626,4.353448275862069
8153156,5,B000JU7JGY,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I wish Scott Bairstow would act in more movies. He is an incredible, gifted actor. I first saw him in an episode of Touched By An Angel, and his role was riveting!",1393632000,,200,4.2894736842105265

8153158,5,B000JU7JGY,"I've been a Nancy Travis fan since Rose Red and this movie is no exception. I saw it on the Hallmark channel 5 years ago and decided to try it--it was 3 am on a hot summer night. This movie surpassed any expectation. I spent 5 years trying to find my own copy, no matter how much I dvr'd it, it wasn't enough. I'd given up until I decided to try Amazon. Never tried it before, but I was desparate. I found an inexpensive DVD copy and ordered it. It shipped much quicker than I expected and arrived in mint condition, and it was full screen! Let's hope I don't wear it out now.",1370649600,,576,4.06140350877193
