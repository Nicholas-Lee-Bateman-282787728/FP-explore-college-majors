It's a good film.
But the Blu Ray is disappointing.
Menus are in Standard Defintion, and not all the extras have been included.
I also have the other version, also available from Amazon.

Although directed by a Westerner (Paul Spurrier of Underground) the film is intended for a Thai audience, and so can be a bit challenging for a Westerner who's not familiar with the culture of the region, and is constrained by the censorship restrictions of the Kingdom.  But the story is sound, with buckets of blood and gore for the diehard fans, and details of Bangkok and Isaan life that are hard to find elsewhere (although with Bangkok Dangerous remade with Nick Cage, we are seeing more).

The movie is very well crafted (particularly in comparison to most other Thai films) shot in widescreen on 70mm, the sound is excellent throughout, and the overall feel of the film makes for a very good watch.

I'll have to try and find a copy from Singapore or Australia, I suppose",1221696000,,937,4.654545454545454
