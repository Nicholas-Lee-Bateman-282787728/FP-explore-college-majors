2886921,1,B000SM6FKY,"I needed to take a shower after watching this to get the slime off.
My God but this is a horrible flick.

What is a movie that details the making of a snuff film if not a snuff film? The movie poster said, ""10 will fight. 9 will die. AND YOU GET TO WATCH."" Wish I'd seen that before I watched this piece of manipulative garbage (somewhat well-made and semi-convincing garbage, which only heightens the disgust). It ends with some weak diatribes about how we the viewers are really The Condemned, not the death row prisoners who are killing each other on the deserted island. What a joke that is.

This movie absolutely glories in showing every bit of blood and bullets and knives ripping through flesh and even a long, drawn-out rape scene; it pretends to be judging the makers of reality shows, but in reality it's the makers of this movie who use this premise to create what is really just a totally sleazy piece of violence pornography.

I don't mind violence if it means something useful, as in Fight Club, The Godfather, and some other films. But here it's just porn, period. And then to fatuously attach a moral at the end saying, watching sick violence is wrong? Well, what does that make the creators of this film filled with sick violence?

EVERYBODY dies in this snuff-fest, except our hero, of course. As in The Shooter and so many other recent films, our hero is an ex-American military secret service guy pulled back into the fray (message: our government is run by bad guys, but there are lots of other good guys with endless weapons who fight for Good and Honor and Justice, so join the military now). Towards the end, when Vinnie starts killing everyone in sight, I actually felt queasy upon realizing that there really is no point to this film except to glamorize death via violence and rage. I felt used; there was nothing approaching any sort of redemption.

I don't know what I expected; someone whose taste I thought was ok recommended it. Lesson learned. I expected something more wrestling/cartoonish; nothing cartoonish here except the level of thought. Apparently WWE thinks its audience needs this kind of pornography; it's a sad thought.

Do NOT let your kids or anyone you love watch this. It will only plant nasty, brutal images and thoughts in their head, with nothing positive to add. But then, I guess a lot of hollywood movies are just ads for the glory of violence. How else can we convince a whole nation to let their tax dollars be used for killing strangers day in and day out? Looks like the plan is working.

If one person avoids this film and watches something intelligent instead, this review has done its job.",1190678400,2,2651,4.627659574468085
2886922,4,B000SM6FKY,"you will NOT be disappointed...it is non-stop action from start to finish...I LOVED it...Stone Cold Steve Austin was excellent in it, along with Vinnie Jones..check it out...it's worth it..this is by far the BEST film that WWE Films has done...The Marine was good(2 1/2 stars), See No Evil w/ Kane really sucked(1 star) but, in my book, this one was worth 4 1/2 stars...lots of action, showed how far some reality shows may or could go, has a couple scenes that should've been edited out but other than that, it's a good film...it's a movie I could watch over and over again..",1190505600,,576,4.6568627450980395
2886923,4,B000SM6FKY,"The plot is pretty straight forward. This rich media mogul buys 10 death row prisoners from various countries and sets it up so that they have to fight to the death on a remote Pacific island.
The purpose is to film it all and broadcast it on the net, for a $49.99 subscription fee, of course.
The point of the movie is to say something about the human propensity towards not only violence, in everyone, but the voyeuristic enjoyment that we get out of just watching fighting. The point that watching and participating, sitting in a comfortable chair at a monitor and out in the real world dying and the bifurcation of our mental worlds into false-net-computer and RL and how our morality and instinctual settings just don't seem to function right in this brave new world of on line fighting/gambling/etc.

Technically the movie is great, well filmed, absolutely beautiful. The actors, despite (or maybe because of) being WWE players are pretty good. The dialog flows much above average for fight movies, the writing is well above average for movies with violence and ku-fu type martial arts and lots of bloody pieces. Now it is not a slasher movie, not a horror movie (like it could have been), but a more genuine fight movie than most movies you'd put into this genre. How would an add read: ""adrenaline pumping, action packed, no holds barred vision of big mean nasty guys (and 2 ladies) whalloping on each other for your viewing pleasure"".

And that is the big point. The movie is about filming a movie about violence. The on screen movie team(those supplying the net feed of the action) are on the island, they are voyeurs and eventually RL participants in the show. But the viewers of the movie, you and i on this side of the 4th wall are also voyeurs, watching not only the violence on the net feed, but the analogous violence of those who setup and participate in creating the show. A complex set of russian dolls, but the voyeur is in all of us, because we chose and watched this movie.

It is an interesting point, the brutality is a bit much, i'm glad they were not specific about the rape scene. It is well pulled off and worthwhile to watch. good all round job. The main character is one big man, that has to be many hours in the gym, driven by an ambition that ought to bring him to the screen again.",1190505600,3,2314,4.5311004784688995
2886924,3,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is about prisoners put on an island to compete and kill for freedom. It trys to make a point about how far reality shows could get eventually. But pleanty of movies already touched upon that fine already.

  Movies like the Truman Show and Ed TV made that point without all the brutal violence. Plus Ed Harris played an evil producer who would do anything for ratings in the Truman Show. He did it better than the guy in this as well.

  We also have had prisoners fighting for survival on a show in The Running Man as well. The prisoners on an island thing was done in a movie called No Way Out in the 90's as well.

  Still this movie is better than any of the other films the WWE has done so far. It's better made than the Marine and more watchable as well despite how violent and heartless it can be. Stone Cold carries this movie just as good as the Rock plus un-like the Rock I doubt Stone Cold would ever do a Disney film....thank god.

  Stone Cold shows some ability here, I'd rather see more of him on screen than Cena. Cena can do action but that's about it. Otherwise his acting was dead. He was like a talking robot. Stone Cold though is cool and fun to watch and delivers lines much better. I like Robert Patrick but Vinnie Jones makes for a better villian for a big wrestler to take on in a movie as well.",1190073600,2,1334,4.188235294117647

2886926,5,B000SM6FKY,"First off was see no evil which was a decent horror movie but it was no classic and i couldn't watch it a 2nd time. The marine was a joke of an action flick which I couldn't even get through once. Now the condemned I've seen twice in 2 days and i wanna watch it again its one of those films. I really enjoyed this, Steve Austin was amazing there was also a few other good actors such as Vinnie Jones & Rick Hoffman but Austin definatley stole the show cant wait for the dvd release and I hope this is not the last hollywood see's of Steve Austin",1178236800,5,545,4.009174311926605
2886927,4,B000SM6FKY,"This one has a shot at going down as an action classic. The story was well thought out and brilliantly executed. I was alternately cheering and jeering for a lot of the characters. While The Marine could possibly win some prizes for fight choreography and explosions, The Condemned could win those AND for story and cinematography. Stone Cold was incredible, and for my money he's a better actor than John Cena.",1177632000,5,411,4.802816901408451
2886928,4,B000SM6FKY,"After seeing See No Evil and The Marine, I was very dissapointed at what the newly created WWE Films tried to do: try and repeat another successful Rock-like wrestler-starring movie. See No Evil and The Marine both have decent acting, but the stories were extremely rushed and I myself decided to give WWE Films one more chance at making a good movie before I completely gave up. Enter The Condemned starring ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. I thought that, once again, the story would be rushed and make a terrible action flick.

Boy was I wrong.

When the movie started, it began pretty much like the last two WWE films: rushed. But when the actual story started (The game itself), the story slowed down and didn't just kill off one character after another to make the movie end quickly. The interesting plot twist in the middle of the film helped the movie greatly and the climax fight scene was just amazing. Yes, there are a few explosions (thankfully not anything crazy like what The Marine tried to do) but the characters adapted to each and every cut, scrape, and basically any bodily injury well (unlike John Cena in The Marine).

So, overall I recommend this movie to not only wrestling fans (like myself), but to anyone who wants to see a good action/thriller film. If you can only get past the jerky camera movements, you'll be in for a ride. I personally give this movie 4 Stone Cold Stunners out of 5.",1177632000,8,1409,4.605577689243028

2887003,5,B000SM6FKY,"Say what you will about WWE Studio movies, but the Condemned is pretty darn exciting!  That John Cena movie the Marine was pretty action-packed as well.  The Rock?  Well he might be the most successful movie star of all the current generation wrestlers (or last generation, whatever) but he has a bunch of films that are hit and miss.  The Condemned is total excitement from beginning to end with suspense being a big element as well.

Anyway the Condemned of course stars Steve Austin.  Turns out that for the purpose of an incredibly daring brand new reality show, 10 criminals are forced onto an island/forest to kill each other, and the last man standing gets two treats- freedom and lots of money.  This is pretty much the same concept as the Hunger Games but with WAY more action, suspense and violence (and of course involves grown men instead of teenagers).

Not only that but each criminal has a bomb attached around his or her ankles, and the object is to take advantage of the criminals in vulnerable or defeated states, pull the pin of the bomb and thus blow the contestants up.  Sounds... delightful!  Actually it's pretty darn sick and twisted.  The whole concept.  I didn't think the WWE would ever choose to make a movie so disturbing but apparently so!

When the actual fighting gets underway, well some of the criminals temporarily team up together (such as the Australian and Asian guy played by Vinnie Jones and Masa Yamaguchi respectively) and to a lesser extent, Steve Austin and Manu Bennett's character because it turns out Manu's girlfriend or wife is also a criminal and he witnessed her getting raped and beaten on while he was chained to the side and unable to help, so Steve Austin feels sorry for him and lends him a hand.  Emelia Burns and Marcus Johnson only pretend to team up but well, that certainly goes wrong in a hurry!

You can pretty much guess who ends up winning this sick reality game, but Vinnie Jones turns out to be Steve Austin's biggest threat given they both share similar backgrounds.  Of course that fight Steve has with that big dude early on... well he was actually kicking Steve Austin around for a while!  It's a good thing Austin found a way to detonate that bomb or I don't think Austin would have won that one, and that would've changed the whole game around.

Another element to the story is that the film crew part of this sick reality game are trying to be as edgy and daring as possible so they take comfort in excitedly foaming at the mouth when the ratings start to skyrocket and the actual killings are shown on camera.  They're attempting to get over 40 million views online and surpass the Super Bowl.  However when the rape scene mentioned above happens, some of the crew start turning their back on the guy in charge (I *think* played by Robert Mammone though I might be getting him mixed up with Sullivan Stapleton- my bad!)  The cute Tory Mussett and Rick Hoffman are the two who begin to realize ""Maybe we're taking this thing too far!""

I like how there's cameras all over the forest and yet, the fighters never think about destroying them.  It's not like most of them are out of reach or anything.  This is probably because occasionally the film crew flies in supplies and weapons for certain contestants.  I was also wondering when or if -given how far-fetched of a story this is- the mentally disturbing concept of criminals having to kill each other would be brought up, and it eventually is but not as dramatically as I would have expected except for that one reporter woman who questions Robert during an interview.  Otherwise we're supposed to believe such an event would actually be allowed between criminals which is kind of funny I suppose (especially realizing that children have easy access viewing the event online).  Nah, don't think people turning into animals and killing each other is EVER going to be allowed!

Anyway the Condemned is pure excitement.  Steve Austin of course steals the show, but the way this 10-man fight to the death unfolds is quite exciting to watch.  Sometimes the film jumps from one camera angle into another so quickly it's hard to keep up with the fighting on screen, but only sometimes does this become a problem.  Expect Vinnie Jones to get his share of TV time as the bad guy of the bunch (uh, make that the REALLY bad guy!)",1466035200,,4344,4.63921568627451

The company takes 10 hardened criminals and put them on an island with 24 hours to pretty much kill each other,and the 1 con that remains gets their freedom. The show is broadcast online & tons of people are subscribing to watch,so the creators stand to make a fortune off of this game show. I enjoy the fact that the movie is fast-paced and there is non-stop action and brutal fight sequences. The head role is played by Steve Austin and the internet company decides to paint him black,making accusations that he was a KKK member who wiped out a family(which is all bs) just to get higher ratings. Each of the 10 ""contestants"" is rigged with a C4 explosive charge that will detonate if tampered with or the person decides to pull it to eliminate the enemy. There is a big feud between Austin & Vinnie Jones that escalates til' the end and is an all out brawl. Vinnie decides to take the creators of the game hostage,kill the workers and take all the money. Austin's ex-wife is watching this all unfold on the internet & i will not give away the ending but Austin prevails and regains his freedom. If you are a fan of hardcore action movies or a fan of Stone Cold then you will enjoy this movie,it is nonstop action from start to finish. I hope this was helpful. Enjoy.",1433548800,,1532,4.475

2887120,5,B000SM6FKY,"I heard of this movie from a buddy of mine so I decided to give it a shot and watch it, I went out and bought it for like 3 bucks along with a couple other movies. I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. this was a very good action flick which featured two of my favorite actors ,Manu Bennett and Steve Austin...

this movie is about a group of producers that make a illegal TV show online that make fighting criminals fight to thee death to see who will be the last to survive. whoever wins gets to get out of prison and go home, but in my opinion I think they would just kill the winner anyway. but something happens and a clear winner of the actual show never presents itself , the one who ended up killing everyone found a way home on his own without the help of the illegal film producers, due to another one of the prisoners basically slaughtering all of them but the main producer. it was down to jack(stone cold) and the other survivor who was given an unfair advantage. Meanwhile back in Texas where Jack lives, all of his friends and his wife are watching on the computer...what is weird about this is that Jack's wife or kids have not made contact with jack in forever , not knowing of him being arrested. she knew something was wrong right away because the description of jack said that he was a KKK member and blew up a mental retardation hospital.... anyway she was watching when it looks like Jack gets killed. in the end Jack lives and wins the show and goes home to Texas.

the only thing that was challenging for me was to follow the camera. it seemed like it was all over the place. but besides that minor setback this movie was great. watch it! 5 out of 5",1404864000,,1691,4.184049079754601

2887128,5,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is one of those movies that you know right off the bat is made for one specific type of audience. If you like reading Jane Austin novels and sunsets and walks along the beach and romantic movies then this movie may not be for you. This is all out balls to the wall action movie that does not apologize for what it is. Premise is a reality series producer is putting together the ultimate survivor series on the internet. He picks ten people from the worst prisons around the world and buys them from death row and attaches a bomb to their ankles. The Bomb will go off in 24 hours the catch is simple only one can win. It's a fight to the death the prize is you get your life your freedom and a big bankroll. Trapped amongst the sadistic killers is Jack Conrad (Steve Austin) a former Navy S.E.A.L. who was recruited to do black ops types of jobs his last one went bad and he was caught in El Salvador awaiting death. All Conrad wants to do is get out of this alive and go home to his girl. But Conrad is decent man with Honor and a code of principles that will not let him take part in this sadistic game so he tries his best to survive and get help. Steve Austin does a good job in his first film As lead actor and he's gone on to make better films since his role in the EXPENDABLES is much better and you can see Austin has grown as a actor, This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of this type of action flick.

He promises them that they must fight each other to the death and the last person left alive will be set free with a new life and alot of money.
The cons are brought to the island with an ankle bracelet on that is a bomb. If they try to remove it they will blow up. If another con fights them and pulls a red tab on the side of their ankle they will blow up. It will be removed for the survivor only. The convicts are eight men and 2 women.
The main character is con Jack Austin (Steve Austin). He was left in a Central American prison by the U.S. Government after doing work for them and getting caught. His main focus after getting on the island is getting to the base he seen when they were arriving by helicopter. He fights to stay alive. He is the only ""good"" guy there.
The fights they have, the explosions of people can make a stomach turn..or at least it did mine, but the movie is exciting! I do not want to say to much more because I do not want to give away want happens with the ""game"" of survival and at the end.

2887206,2,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is a World Wrestling Entertainment-produced film starring ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin as Jack Conrad. You could be forgiven for assuming this movie is a propaganda vehicle for wrestlers looking to break into acting, with a plot that's no deeper than brawny men beating the tar out of each other. And you'd be right.

But The Condemned has higher goals in mind.  It features an online game show in which dangerous convicts are purchased by a wealthy television producer (Robert Mammone as Breckel) for use as contestants. Each contestant has 30-hours to live before an ankle-bracelet explodes.  Additionally, a ripcord on the bracelet can trigger the bomb ten seconds later.  Ten people enter an island rigged with cameras and cameramen, one killer leaves.

The Condemned divides its time between the killers offing each other, the technical team conducting the game show, and the FBI investigation trying to stop the madness. As each killer dies, the game show's website gets more and more hits.  The more violent the movie gets, the more the audience loves it.  The Condemned slyly begins blurring the lines between the audience watching the film and the audience in the movie.

Conrad is actually an undercover Delta Force operative, of course, and sets out to prove he's bigger and badder than everyone else on the island. It's no easy task, however -- the villainous team-up of Ewan McStanley (Vinnie Jones) and Saiga (Masa Yamaguchi) set the bar low with rape and murder under their belts.

It's the rape scene that proves a turning point for the producers and the film. The technical team begins having second thoughts about the show after that, and a rebellion of sorts breaks out, only to be brutally crushed by the usual tools of archvillainy - deceit, greed, and murder. By the time McStanley's in-game violence spills into the production studio, they've long since lost their grip on morality.

The Condemned is an ugly film about ugly characters.  Its biggest flaw is that Conrad isn't particularly likable. The movie takes its premise too far.  There's nobody to really root for.  Midway through, The Condemned drastically changes tone from glorifying violence to soundly condemning it, which will likely turn a lot of wrestling fans off. Viewers may not be pleased to discover that the title isn't just about the contestants - it's about the audience.",1296950400,,2377,5.017811704834606

2887231,3,B000SM6FKY,"Once in a while films like ""The Condemned"" come out and remind us that old B-movie premise never dies. The story of the WWE-produced film is simple. Ten death row convicts from all over the world are brought to a deserted Pacific island, where they are forced to kill each other. The battles are broadcast via internet (US$49.95 needed to view) and the last man (or woman) standing will be awarded money and a right to be free.

Now, Steve Austin plays Conrad, a contestant who is ""bought"" from a Central American prison by an enterprising producer Breckel (Robert Mammone). Most viewers know from the very beginning where this ""Battle Royale""-style story is going. Vinnie Jones plays McStarley, a former British forces agent - a typical ""dangerous"" character Jones is often required to play.

This is not the worst action movie I have ever seen. I have seen much worse ones. It is just that the actions in ""The Condemned,"" which look often repetitious, are ordinary, familiar and ... well, in short, nothing new. What is worse is the film's ""serious"" moments that become sometimes preachy, stressing moral issues that are too obvious. Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Running Man,"" silly and campy as it was, knew what it was doing. It was guilty pleasure, but still fun, which is something missing here.

There are explosions, shoot-outs and more, but director Scott Wiper wastes the potential to make an entertaining film, and ends up with a mediocre action film that is too long, and what is worse, that takes itself all too seriously.",1281571200,,1531,4.880769230769231

Starring arguably one of the most-compelling pro wrestlers of all time, Stone Cold Steve Austin, this movie consists of a real-life ""game"" where an internet-based promotor takes criminals and puts them on an island to fight to the death.  The sole survivor earns his freedom.

This movie also stars Vinnie Jones, who is an underrated actor.  He is an excellent actor and eventually becomes the lead villan in this film.

This film is well-acted and Stone Cold fits the role perfectly.  In terms of wrestlers-turned-actors, this film is on par with The Rock's performances and is worth taking a look.  It is by far, Stone Cold's best film to date.",1277078400,,843,4.772413793103448

Derivative and predictable? Hell yes.

But surprise, surprise it has some decent acting. There is a good range of characters, and the supporting cast makes each little scene count. Basically there is a split between the rough mega-criminals chosen against their will to battle to the death on a remote island laced with Internet cameras, and the techno-geeks who are profiting from their suffering. Within each group there are enough different individual characters to keep it interesting.

The movie's director holds a very good pace throughout. Great payoff when the techno-geeks get their comeuppance -- even though some of them had shown pseudo-remorse half way through the inferno.

The two wrestling guys (I'm not a fan of wrestling) turn in very credible performances.

The special effects are not extravagant, but there is enough punch for this story. The portrayal of Internet video feeds is done quite well.

2887237,4,B000SM6FKY,"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Productions, The Condemned (2007), is a high energy, testosterone rich, bone crunching, often brutal, action/adventure.  Directed and co-written by Scott Wiper, and shot in Australia, the project is a star vehicle for former pro wrestler `Stone Cold' Steve Austin.  Austin is Jack Conrad, one of ten convicts condemned to die, selected to participate in a survival contest on a remote Pacific island.  The last one left alive after thirty hours wins their freedom.  Promoter Ian Breckel (Robert Mammone), has orchestrated it all to make a profit.  With cameras setup all around the island to stream live video of the deadly events, to a pay-for-view internet audience.  Breckel controls the cameras, and directs the production crew from a studio on the island.

Pitting ten hardened criminals against each other soon produces results, and as contestants are eliminated from the game, the number of paying subscribers begins to climb.  It is bad news for the other contestants when psycho ex-mercenary Ewan McStarley (Vinnie Jones) and martial arts expert Saiga (Masa Yamaguchi) team up.  Breckel is manipulating the results by supplying the pair with weapons.  Another team is a husband and wife both convicted of murder, unfortunately they are the first to be eliminated by the sadistic duo.

The Condemned delivers solidly in the action and fighting departments, in particular Conrad's extended fight scenes in the jungle with Saiga and McStarley are ferocious and intense.  Steve Austin may have had limited acting experience, and his dialog is sparse, but he has an immense screen presence, and does more than a credible acting job for a film of this type.  The film also attempts to be socially provocative, examining questions of morality, voyeurism, and the limits of 'reality' television.  While it may not be the most appropriate setting, these are still some interesting issues to consider.  In a taut and edgy performance, Vinnie Jones plays it straight as a pure evil villain, that you truly look forward to seeing breathe his last.  Yet interestingly, it is through McStarley that a key part of the film's message is delivered.

The DVD includes an informative commentary track by director Scott Wiper, and a second commentary with Wiper, and an extremely down to earth and amusing, Steve Austin.  There are also various special features, highlighted by a fairly comprehensive and insightful making of feature.  It has taken a while, but Stone Cold should be back soon in the feature films Damage, and also Sylvester Stalone's project The Expendables.",1251331200,,2600,5.2216867469879515

2887252,1,B000SM6FKY,"The Bottom Line:

A terrible quasi-remake of Battle Royale leavened with some of the most ham-handed and hypocritical social commentary any movie has ever offered, The Condemned has absolutely nothing to recommend it; action fans will be disappointed at the predictable and poorly-directed fight scenes and anyone who can't turn off their brain will be appalled.",1233532800,3,362,5.464285714285714

2887254,3,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is a ""logical result"" film. In recent years, the reality show craze has included shows that involve people risking serious personal injury for bucks. The logical result is a show that involves people getting killed. This film is about such a scenario. Ten condemned convicts in ""third world"" prisons(a few of whom are from ""first world"" countries) are placed on a remote island. They will fight to the death as millions watch (for a hefty fee) on the Internet. The last one standing will be freed.

Cameras are placed everywhere on the island and subscribers to the show on the Net get to see the gore up close. There are cold-blooded teckies in a control room under the supervision of a greedy producer, unconvincingly portrayed by Robert Mammone. The condemned range from the really really bad, to the not so bad at all, to the very good (Jack Conrad).

Steve Austin plays Jack Conrad. Austin has three expressions: tough with a grimace, tough with a grin, and just plain tough.

All in all, it's an exciting action film that does not seem to recognize the irony of moralizing about exactly the type of entertainment we see on the screen.",1218931200,,1154,4.731343283582089
2887255,4,B000SM6FKY,"A group of 10 condemned criminals are taken to an island and set against each other, with freedom being the prize for the last survivor.

There is very little in ""The Condemned"" that is remotely original; it could essentially be described as ""The Running Man"" meets ""Battle Royale"" meets ""Die Hard"". Yet, in spite of the fact that I have seen all of these films many times, it didn't bother me. ""The Condemned"" is a good action film that required very little brain power and kept me entertained for its entire duration. There is very little character development; the hero (wrestler Steve Austin) barely speaks; and the message at the end is delivered in a rather heavy-handed manner; but if you're looking for 100 minutes of mindless violence, then this film won't disappoint.",1218153600,3,777,4.842105263157895

No emotion, no real expressions of loss, or pain, or just about anything. I think he needs to know what it really takes to make a good movie. However, ""The Condemned"" out-shined them with flaw-less proformance. I just pray that the next WWE film that comes out will just as, or better then this one.

2887258,4,B000SM6FKY,"I got the DVD from the library so there was no great investment on my part and really expected to stop it after 20 minutes. But it surprised me. Robert Mammone, as the tycoon sponsoring this internet viewing only battle royal to the death, has solid acting chops along with the always interesting to watch Rick Hoffman. Of the group of combatants, Manu Bennet and Dasi Ruz show real chemistry and Vinnie Jones is always believable as a murderous bastard.

Okay, the premise is simple as any action movie tends to be whether it's escaping aliens (""Predator,"" ""Alien"") or stopping the thing that will end the world (""The Rock,"" ""Armagedon""). A rich, pompous, self absorbed tycoon buys convicted criminals from jails around the world, brings them to a small island and offers them freedom if they're the last one alive after 30 hours while he broadcasts on the internet for $49.95. To their ankle is strapped an explosive device that will trigger if they try to remove it.

What makes a story interesting is it's execution from casting, directing, cinematography, dialogue, etc. Every romance story is the same boy meets, girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl reunite in the end. Director Scott Wiper knows he's not making a Merchant Ivory film and so focuses on the compelling fight sequences, the question of who will be left, and how they are eliminated.

Now, I've read critiques about Austin's acting and I don't think these viewers get it. As the director states in the commentary, Austin, like other action heroes before him, has the confidence to do nothing. His range is limited and it plays to his advantage. Looking back on the Schwarzenegger Stallone era, does anybody remember them acting other than cool under fire? Clint Eastwood made a career out of squinting and teeth gritting. Look at your rappers supposedly turned ""actors"" like Ice-T, DMX, LL Cool J. Their entire range consists of going from snotty to snottier and back again. So Austin playing it tight and close only works for him and the role. He's the hero and viewers expect certain behavior from them. Other characters are used to portray the emotions of danger, fear and sadness that help us read the severity of the situation.

Now as far as the commentary on reality shows and internet viewership, and the lust for violence I'll leave it to the sociologists and more scholarly journals. Suffice to say, this is a good solid action flick, worth the rental price. So sit back, turn off your brain and enjoy.",1217203200,,2480,4.8009367681498825
2887269,2,B000SM6FKY,"""The Condemned"" is one of those what-is-the-world-coming-to cautionary tales (like ""Rollerball"") that defy all logic and credibility from the get-go.  We're supposed to believe, for instance, that any number of the world's leading prison officials would be willing to overturn the sentences of some of their most notorious death-row inmates just so they could be taken to some remote island and forced to participate in a kill-or-be-killed, last-man-standing reality show being broadcast live on the world wide web (think of it as a ""Survivor"" knockoff where teamwork and cooperation are decidedly NOT part of a winning strategy).

Director Scott Wiper has begun by filling his tank with high-octane testosterone, then setting his vehicle on autopilot, subjecting the audience to one fight-to-the-death battle scene after another, with nary a time out for storyline or character development (the latter a sure-fire action-movie buzz-killer if ever there was one).  However, in order to generate some sympathy for the characters, the filmmakers are quick to point out that a number of the unwitting contestants aren't quite the irredeemable blackguards and bad guys we'd been led to believe they were at the outset.  This applies particularly to Steve Austin`s Jack Conrad, a highly principled special ops agent who was left by his CIA bosses to rot in a Salvadoran prison after his cover was blown several years back.

In a bid to earn itself some intellectual cred with the deeper thinkers in the audience, the movie gets all high-minded and sanctimonious about the role bloodlust plays in our sports and entertainment - as if ""The Condemned"" were anything but a prime example of the very thing it is purporting to rail against.  Apparently, that little bit of irony was lost on those who made the film.",1213056000,,1804,5.18213058419244
2887270,4,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is a WWE Films product so my expectations could not have been lower. But instead of a gory no-brainer it was surprisingly clever gorefest and very critical of the violence-driven entertainment industry; something that WWE itself is part of. Those accustomed to European movies may think it drives its message home too strongly but I was still pleasantly surprised to see that kind of thinking in a Hollywood product.

Acting ranged from fair to good and while practically most people didn't get very many lines of dialogue, they did what they could with their face time. The protagonist is a little cliched but considering it was played by Steve ""Stone Cold"" Austin it could have been much, much worse. The antagonists were, for the most part, delightful and the setting had more than one layer to it. Action could have benefited from less shaky-cam and more choreography but still got the adrenaline flowing.

I actually think this film tops Battle Royale, heresy though that may be and earns bonus points for having a message that runs counter to its obvious target demographic. The Condemned was a box office flop and judging from various forums, pro-wrestling fans really hate it. I guess the message struck a little too close to home.",1211587200,,1253,4.90566037735849
2887271,4,B000SM6FKY,"When I first saw the trailer to this, I thought it was going to be a cheap WWE video where they put one of there superstars into it for the hell of it to make some money.

But unlike a lot of the other WWE made videos, this one is one of the better one's I have seen.

Now, I hate reality TV, I really do, but this plot about a producer taking 12 condemned men and women who are on death row, dropping them off on an island and letting them slug it out to the death till there is only one man left standing, all while being broadcast over the internet for the world to watch is far from being reality TV, but hey, it's a movie, you can do this stuff in a movie.

3:16 Stone Cold Steve ""WHAT?"" Austin (Steve Williams) plays a character of a retired special forces guy who was captured on a secret mission a year ago and is now the hero of the story, as he gets stuck on an island with a bunch of bad guys and some not so bad guys.

It kind of reminds me of a combination of Con Air meets The Running Man type of thing.

Overall, it's not a breathtaking plot or going to make you believe it's one of the greatest movies of all time, but it has it's moments and is definitely worth a rental at least.

Austin was believable in his acting, I did not feel at any time he could not act, and I even forgot he was the rattle snake in the movie and did not even expect to see him drink a beer, throw the fingers up and give someone a stunner.

Reading other reviews, it seems they where disappointed that Austin is playing a character thats not Stone Cold... god, get over it, there not going to do a movie completely based around a wrestling finishing move.

Apart from that, i enjoyed this one, and I just say, go into not expecting the Stone Cold you know from the ring, and you might just enjoy this one.",1211587200,,1799,4.005586592178771

The story places Jack Riley, an ex special forces operative is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and winds up on death row. A multi millionaire is ready to give him his break as he has a concept to place 10 Death Row convicts on an Island and let them loose on each other. They are told that there must only be one man left standing after the 30 hour time limit, or they all die. The last man standing is given his freedom and Breckel, the man with the concept will capitalise off the millions of internet subscribers who want to watch a live death tournament.
Jack Riley after being missing for over a year is seen by one of his old school friends and the FBI inform his wife, Sarah Cavanaugh. The only thing she can do is wait and watch and hope he wins the tournament because there's only one way out and that's to kill.

Along with this being a WWE film I have to say Austin was the perfect person for the lead character. He's tough, he's got an attitude and he fears nothing. For those fans of the wrestling world they will say the pure depiction of such a personality is Austin. For those who aren't familiar with Steve Austin within the wrestling world you will still come to appreciate how much of an intimidating character Steve Austin can portray. Vinnie Jones is something special as well and presents something that can be quite scary and at times make it awkward to watch.

This is a pretty mindless action movie but that's something that can gain an appreciation on its own. If you decide to forget that it's associated with the WWE I garauntee that you won't be disappointed by how fun this can be.",1206576000,,1877,4.311614730878187

2887281,3,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is another attempt by the WWE's film producing unit to come up with a big-screen vehicle for one of its major wrestling personalities. John Cena already did his time (and not in a good way) with the laughable and unwatchable The Marine. Now WWE hoped to have better luck with The Condemned starring the Texas Rattlesnake himself, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

The basic plot of the movie has some hotshot tv producer set to begin an ultraviolent reality show on the internet. The show's premise of taking ten condemned prisoners from around the globe and dropping them in the middle of a South Pacific island to fight it out for their eventual freedom is avoided like the plague by the other networks. Ronert Mammone plays the producer Ian Breckel with an over-the-top, mustache twirling performance that to say he wasn't subtle would be an understatement. Really the whole cast in the film barely register on the screen. The pace of the movie keeps dialogue to a minimum which is a blessing. The movie stands on the shoulders of the charismatic Steve Austin who actually looks like he could lay the smackdown on everyone on the screen for real. While his acting skills is quite basic there's not much more needed for him to really do. He just had to kick ass and not look cartoonish while doing it. In that respect he succeeds.

The story on the other hand could've been better handled. While The Condemned brings nothing to the table that Battle Royale and Most Dangerous Game hasn't already done it does bring the whole reality-tv concept into the mix. This movie could've become one of those little B-movie gems which has over-the-top action with just enough smarts to keep it from Mystery Science Theater 3000 level. It doesn't reach that level. For a movie about a fight to the death between the worst of the worst from prisons around the world there's way too little action. The filmmakers could easily have dropped all pretenses of trying to make a point about the effects and role of violence in the media and the movie would've been way better in the end.

So, while The Condemned was an average-to-good piece of pulp it could've been better if it actually concentrated on the deathmatch scenario introduced as the plot of the movie. I know this for sure and that it is ten times better than John Cena's The Marine.",1201219200,,2335,4.690243902439025

To the films discredit, the last WWE movie I saw was The Marine which I thought was terrible, this greatly lowered my expectations.

After watching the movie, I was defiantly pleased overall but had a few complaints:
-They switch angles on the fight scenes too much and some of the angles make the fighting look phony
-there wasn't a climatic final showdown between the ""protagonist"" and ""antagonist""
-The last ""antagonist"" to die does so in a lame and corny way
-Its annoying how the movie constantly switches from a fight scene to the people watching a fight scene. When I watch a fight scene I don't want it to be interrupted.
-And I'll be honest here: There's a subplot that involves the protagonist having a wife back home, I fast forwarded through any scenes with her as I saw it as unnecessary filler.

Now for the good:
-Overall the fight scenes were amazing - this movie took itself seriously
-There weren't ANY bad jokes are puns that ruined the movie
-The movie just did a very good job as an all around action movie, it delivers a good action flick to the male audience",1200960000,,1301,4.551282051282051

2887285,3,B000SM6FKY,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be simple, straight-out, violent no-brains suspense and fight action.  Things get off on that note, and within 30 minutes of the nearly 2 hour film, the action begins.  I began to ask myself, how can this all out action keep on for nearly another 90 minutes?  I soon discovered the answer when the film begin to expand its direction with its story, protesting the violence it was glamorizing.  While I found myself interested in where this concept was going, i just found myself more confused to exactly what it is I am supposed to be watching.  The violence felt to glamorized to follow the ideals that this is wrong, but those some ideals kept the movie from being a simple for fun action feast.

I would like to praise Austin on his performance in this film, but its hard to critique when there isn't much to go off of.  He did not receive the most screen time in this film, and the dialouge he had was kept fairly minimal.  The Condemned focused more on Vinnie Jones - the one man that predictably is going to become Austin's nemesis.  In fact, Jones arguably steals the show making a much stronger presence in his villainous role.

Above all else I wanted good action and suspense with this film.  Overall, the action felt average.  The fights are brutal, bloody, and pack a punch.  The camera ruined several good fights with its over abundance of shaking and viewing angles zoomed in too far.  The editing is also extensive.  I did like that not all the fights were the same.  Some involved weapons at the fighters disposal, and others revolved around the surrounding landscape of the island, which varied from beaches to the forest and even waterfalls.  But because the point was expressed about the violence being sickening, it quickly changed the feel of the movie, making good ol fun fights history.  Then you have a few near-rape scenes on the women, which is never fun to watch.

Overall, this is well made for what it is, but its hard to determine how to watch this.  Perhaps this is one of those films where no story involvement and just straight out action would have been better.  At least the point is made that violence really is sickening, though its confusing to grasp in this given form of entertainment.

2887287,2,B000SM6FKY,"""The Condemned"", a co-production of the WWE and Lionsgate Films, is the kind of B-movie fodder reminiscent of made-for-cable action flicks of a decade ago, with a bit more gore and graphic language. While wrestling fans may get a kick out of seeing Steve Austin out of the ring, the film is routine, at best, with lapses of logic that will have you scratching your head.

The concept is simple; 10 'Death Row' inmates from Third World jails are sold to an unscrupulous producer, who drops them onto an island filled with hidden cameras, and offers freedom to the last convict alive, after 30 hours, while he broadcasts the mayhem over the Internet. To make things more interesting, he attaches bombs to the leg of each contestant, which will blow up if tampered with, or at the end of the 30 hours, if the 'game' isn't over (so why didn't these bombs explode when the inmates were tossed off helicopters onto the island? Don't ask!)

While the movie lacks humor, the DVD's Special Features more than make up for it, if unintentionally! Watching writers Rob and Andy Hedden claim, with straight faces, that the entire concept of the film sprang from watching 'Reality TV' shows, when key elements were 'lifted' from Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 ""The Running Man"", as well as the oft-filmed ""The Most Dangerous Game"", may bring a chuckle, as will director Scott Wiper's proud assertion that he hired 'real' actors, training them to fight, to increase the film's 'believability' (he WAS kidding, right?)

Steve Austin is no great shakes as an actor, but with his size, bull neck and craggy features, he does project a kind of taciturn integrity; the real acting honors go to veteran screen baddie Vinnie Jones, whose sneering, over-the-top performance overshadows the rest of the cast.

""The Condemned"" is a time-passer, at best; if you're not a wrestling fan, you may prefer to skip it!",1196812800,4,1884,4.859813084112149
2887288,2,B000SM6FKY,"Lord help us all, the WWE is taking the movie business by storm.  The Condemned is the lastest derivative flick to see the light of day, with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin getting the top billing.  Much to my surprise though, The Condemned isn't the total crud-fest one may come to expect.  There's some surprisingly good action scenes to be found here, many of which feature Austin taking on other ""contestants"" on an island where one will be left alive.  The film's message on the media and violence is misguided to say the least, but Austin proves a formidable headliner, albeit rather briefly.  The acting is dreadful, and the film as a whole is quite predictable, but you should already know what to expect from The Condemned in the first place.  The always great Vinnie Jones (Snatch, X-Men: The Last Stand) is here, and provides some great moments though, but that's about all there is.  All in all, The Condemned isn't complete fodder, but there's really nothing worth noting about it either.",1196121600,2,996,4.7894736842105265

2887290,3,B000SM6FKY,"""The Condemned"" may be one of the better movies produced by the film arm of World Wrestling Entertainment, but that's not much of a compliment.

  After all, this rather brutal thriller's competition in that regard includes such duds as last year's duo of ""See No Evil"" and ""The Marine."" And to be honest, it barely surpasses them, thanks to a nasty mean streak toward its female characters -- a real no-no that prevents it from being simple, dumb fun.

  Former WWE wrestler ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin stars as Jack Conrad, one of 10 international, death-row inmates that have been shipped to a remote island to participate in a Web-exclusive ""reality"" program.

  Jack and the others have bombs strapped to their ankles, which are set to go off in 30 hours. The only way for him to stop the bomb -- and possibly gain his freedom -- is to kill the others.

  It's not a horrible setup, even if it is reminiscent of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and other like-minded thrillers. But the film's accusatory tone is somewhat ridiculous (the sleazy show producer character, played by Robert Mammone, is clearly a swipe directed at sometimes controversial ""Survivor"" producer Rob Burnett).

  Also, co-screenwriter/director Scott Wiper had his crews shoot most of the combat scenes in herky-jerky, ""jitter-cam"" style, which renders most of them incomprehensible.

  That may be for the best, though, since this isn't the brainiest material (again, despite the misplaced screeds against reality television).

  However, Austin does have an imposing physical presence and doesn't embarrass himself by overemoting (he really doesn't try to do much more than glare and occasionally utter wisecracks). But former soccer player Vinnie Jones outdoes him as one of the film's eminently hateful villains.

  Quick summary: ""The Condemned"" is rated R (In America, a 15 rating in the UK, no Ireland rating announced yet) for strong scenes of violent action (beatings, stabbings, shootings, vehicular and explosive mayhem, and violence against women, some of it sexual), strong sexual language (profanity and crude slang), gore, crude humor, racial epithets and slurs based on ethnicity or nationality and brief drug references.

2887291,5,B000SM6FKY,"This is by far the best wwe movie yet. it is loaded with action. this movie reminds me of the games Far cry and Manhunt. if you like those games, you'll like this movie",1194566400,,168,3.9705882352941178
2887292,4,B000SM6FKY,"If you think you've seen The Condemned before you wouldn't be entirely mistaken. It borrows elements from several films including Escape from New York, Running Man, and No Escape. Despite that, this is actually a pretty good action flick and really took me by surprise. Wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is Jack Conrad, one of ten condemned prisoners who gets a chance at freedom. A wealthy producer named Breckel has brought Conrad and the other nine prisoners to an island near New Guinea where they will battle to the death with the lone survivor winning his, or her, freedom. Breckel will broadcast the event over the internet and his team has set up hundreds of cameras all around the island to capture the brutal action. Each ""contestant"" has been fitted with an explosive ankle bracelet to keep them in control.

Among the other prisoners is former SAS operative McStarley played by Vinnie Jones. Jones has virtually made a career out of playing similar tough guy roles including Juggernaut in X-Men 3. He plays McStarley to the villainous hilt. McStarley has formed an alliance with Japanese martial artist Saiga, and together they hunt down the rest of the prisoners. Yet another prisoner is played by former WWE wrestler and Strongman competitor, 6' 11"" Nathan Jones. It isn't all just a beat-em-up however. A back-story on Conrad shows that he is more than just an average prisoner. He disappeared from his home in Texas a year earlier without a word to his girlfriend. Now his entire hometown is watching the action unfold over the Internet along with millions of other viewers.

Now, Steve Austin isn't a guy with a lot of acting range. But then again, guys like that (Chuck Norris, Steven Segal) have done quite well for themselves in action hero roles. The writers and director were very smart with the way they handled Austin. Even though he is the star, he isn't asked to carry the film or be in every shot. In fact, several actors, including Jones, have far more lines of dialogue than Austin does. But as the tough guy hero, he does pretty well. He's got the usual hero quips and does an excellent job with the action scenes.

The movie makes a moral point about violence on TV and the internet, and the responsibility that producers of such shows have to the general public. Breckel is the stereotypical smarmy producer who is only interested in trying to get as many viewers as the Super Bowl gets...although I'm thinking forty million viewers might toast his server. The film has some plot holes to be sure...The prisoners are supposed to be on the opposite side of the island from the production facility yet Conrad travels to and from there three times so it must be one tiny island. And then there is the whole logistical issue of setting up hundreds of cameras in this tropical jungle, often having several cameras catching the action at once. That stretches believability quite a bit. There also isn't much development of the prisoners and several are killed off pretty quickly.

In many ways, The Condemned is a throwback to action flicks of the 80's with a tough, no-nonsense hero, a great villain, good looking women, and lots of action. Austin does a solid job with his role but Jones truly shines as the sadistic McStarley. The DVD includes a five-part ""making of"" documentary, audio commentaries, storyboard sequences, and Stone Cold's visit to Movie World.

2887293,5,B000SM6FKY,"I thought the Condemded was a great movie.  I always enjoy Cold Stone Steve Austin.  I'm a fan of his in his Wrestling career.  The movie had drama, action, suspense, it had it all.  I recomend it.",1194393600,,197,4.243243243243243
2887294,4,B000SM6FKY,"Seeing as this movie tanked at the box office, I expected it to be absolutely awful, but surprisingly, it was pretty good.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but since I was such a big fan of Austin's performance, I'll give it 4 stars.

The storyline was a very good one; one that I didn't see coming.  They could have gone a bit deeper into the backgrounds, and the selections of the contestants on the show, and this movie could have easily been 30-45 mins longer.

Stone Cold Steve Austin was very believable as an actor, and I'm surprised I'm saying this, but his Motion Picture debut was a lot more solid than The Rock's was.  I'm a bigger Dwayne Johnson fan, but The Rock was shaky in his first couple of movies.

All in all, a very impressive movie, one that I didn't expect in a million years.",1194393600,,796,4.273333333333333

2887296,4,B000SM6FKY,"The Condemned is essentially a remake of The Most Dangerous Game, an epic book by Richard Connell, about a hunter trapped on an island and begins hunting humans.

This has a twist, however, and the story is a bizarre but effective twist between Ray Liotta's ""No Escape"" and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""The Running Man"".  Where Ice T and Rutger Hauer failed with ""Surviving the Game"", this movie takes off and excels.

An eccentric tv producer who has been shunned by the rest of the industry puts together this deathmatch, and he plans on making a lucrative profit by broadcasting it over the web, charging everyone for entry.  It's a 24-hour a day hunting channel, reality show, and sporting match.

Stone Cold Steve Austin plays an American Special Forces soldier who has to use all his skill, training, and wits to survive against some of the most insane murderers and pathological killers on the planet. Unfortunately, during a mission in a foreign country, he was imprisoned.  How unfortunate...

""The Condemned"" taps into raw emotion, as 10 condemned prisoners from various, vile prisons around the worldd, are purchased with the intention of their unwilling entry into a life or death struggle.  The game is simple: be the last prisoner alive, and get set free.  All others die.  In an interesting twist, another Rutger Hauer movie is tapped into (Deadlock), as each prisoner on the island has explosives strapped to their ankles.  In a short period of time, the explosive device will detonate, and the only way to get it off is to win the competition.

The drama and action build as prisoners die one by one, leaving only the strongest to do battle.  Who will survive?  Watch and find out.",1194220800,,1694,4.857142857142857

The difference is that with Stone Cold, I could tell a difference between Jack Conrad the guy I see in the WWE ring every now and then. Good cinematography, and excellent fight sequences.

of course this movie isn't for the light hearted and weak stomached. it is for those who like watching violence reminescent of that shown on UFC (except a step up on the disgust).

2887303,3,B000SM6FKY,"I rented this flick not expecting much. It's a WWE production and its got Wrestling Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin in the lead. And though, I loved wrestling back in the day was a Stone Cold fan, I really didn't have the faith that he could act. (Though this role wasn't exactly a stretch for him!) Well, I can say now that the film is no where as bad as I expected, and except for very end, I rather enjoyed it. Yeah, the concept has been kinda done before (The Running Man comes to mind instantly), but this was a bit of a new twist. Plus, nowadays its hard to come up with something totally original anyway. There are some good action sequences, and co-star Vinnie Jones shines as the ultimate ""Bad Guy"". No, Stone Cold's performance won't win him an Oscar, but for what kind of film this was and role he played, he wasn't bad. And like I said, I think Vinnie Jones was the real star in the film. However, I'm not saying the film is without its flaws. First off, I didn't like the fact that there was a husband and wife included as one of the 10 condemned. Their characters seemed like some nice couple rather than death row inmates. And at certain other points in the film, some of the prisoners acted out of character. If these 10 people were supposed to be the toughest and meanest people around, they all should've acted like it. Some of the sub-plots were kinda lame as well, mainly with the backstory of Austin's character and his girlfriend/wife. I didn't like the whole scene of him finding a phone on the island and calling her. The fact that he would call her and not someone who could help him is kinda absurd. His character was supposed to be some secret government killing machine. You're telling me he wouldn't know of anyone you could've helped him in out in that situation?? Nevertheless, these are minor discrepancies compared to the glaring bullcrap that was in the very end of the film. WARNING: BIG SPOILER AHEAD!! Here's a scene where we have the ""hero"" Stone Cold throw a bomb into a helicopter as its taking off. In previous shots, the chopper looked pretty damn far up in the air, not to mention all the wind being generated from it during a take-off. Nevertheless, Austin, I assume being a Heisman quarterback, flings it perfectly into the helicopter and the bomb goes off, killing the bad guy! Its sequences just like this one that I usually stay away from these unrealistic, over-the-top action movies. Yes, there was some in this film as well, but nothing that reached this level. Another thing is that you know the ending before you watch the film. I was really hoping that this film would fool me, and that Stone Cold wouldn't be the hero of the film, or at least, wouldn't survive. But my hopes were in vain. How can someone watch a WWE produced film, with a story like this one, that has a famous WWE superstar in it, and not expect Austin to be the main star and survive?? But in any case, this film wasn't all that bad. And apart from the ending and the crappy music by Nickelback during the ending credits, I found the movie quite enjoyable. Again, this film won't be winning any awards, but its definitely worth watching, and perhaps worth owning (for the right price), if you're a fan of the genre.",1191801600,5,3241,4.467116357504215

WWE films always seems to put out movies that would have been a huge box office hit back in the '80s but not in this day in age.

They used humor correctly throughout the movie as it was dry humor & fit in with what the situation was at the time while the fight scenes come off as real fist & martial arts fights instead of heavy ""planned out"" fights that you see today in other big screen movies that come out looking real fake. Multiple stories with each individual (prisoners & those behind the ""show"") being told that all come together at various times kept me interested as well.

Unlike The Marine, they used humor correctly thoughout the movie as it was dry humor & fit in with what the situation was at the time instead of stopping the movie to throw in a bad joke. The fight scenes come off as real fist & martial arts fights instead of heavy ""planned out"" fights that you see today in other big screen movies that come out looking real fake. Multiple stories with each individual (prisioners & those behind the ""show"") being told that all come together at various times kept me interested as well. The alternative commentary with Austin is an interesting listen to as well.

DVD extras include 5 ""The Making Of"" featurettes, two sets of alternative commentary with the directior with one including Austin himself, Stone Cold signing autographs at Austrailia's Movie World, and Austin & Vinnie Jones looking back at their first meeting at the WWE Capital Carnage Show back in 1998.

Overall, this is a movie I would recommend for what it was.

Side Note: There is a dualpack with the full screen version at Walmart complete with a bonus disc of deleted & extended scenes with the director's commentary.",1191024000,,1414,4.625498007968128
2887308,1,B000SM6FKY,"I just finished watching The Condemned. I must say that I didn't want to give it a 1 but a 2 seemed like too much. The movie isn't bad for an action movie but it was not really good or great. The premise is ok but we have kind of seen it before with Series 7 and Running Man and probably others I can't remember. Most of it was pretty good because they didn't sugar coat alot of the people that were suppose to be murderers (except the husband and wife). Vinnie Jones, to me, was the star and should have been (the star), even though he is also limited. That brings me to the weakest part of the movie and that is Stone Cold Steve Austin. He just sucked. He has no range as an actor. And I mean NO RANGE. Every line was delivered the exact same way with the same constipated look on his face no matter if he was killing somebody, talking to his wife he hadn't seen in 2 years or any other situation. He tried to play it cool, I guess, and it just came off as somebody reading their lines, rather poorly and putting about as much effort into it as you would in a read thru. Hey Steve, when you are mad... show some rage and get mad. When you are suppose to be sad... some expression other than... I'm bitter and constipated. He was just horrible. And he wasn't all that good in his fight scenes either. He looked big and slow and he didn't move around like a guy that was suppose to be so dangerous. He looked like a beat up old wrestler who was on a little juice who kind of plodded along like a slow old worn out slug.

Its worth a watch... once. It could have been way better if they would have ditched Stoneslow. He is not an actor and he makes Charles Bronson look like Laurence Olivier.",1190764800,4,1691,4.078078078078078
8205830,4,B000SM6FKY,"A serious film for hard core suspenseful fans of pure action. Easily Stone Cold Steve Austin's best film. The Condemned is a film about a deranged mogul businessman named Breckel (Robert Mammone) intent on having his own show via internet where 10 of the world's biggest and baddest criminals fight it out on a secluded island with one mission at hand: to be the last one standing. Each contestant has ankle bombs around their ankles that are armed for 30 hours with a red clip tag installed in it. Once someone pulls the red tag, after a 10 second delay-Boom! If you try to disarm it, without delay-Boom! Stone Cold stars as Jack Conrad-an innocent prisoner falsely accused for a crime he didn't commit looking to get out and make it back home safe to his family. Alliances are formed and betrayals are set as the object is to kill or be killed. Vinnie Jones has a very powerful performance as McStarly-the most ruthless, cunning bad guy criminal within the contest. It is indeed a must have and must see for any hard core action fan.",1526428800,,1035,4.56989247311828
