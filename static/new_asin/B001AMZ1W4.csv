8278062,1,B001AMZ1W4,The audio on this DVD is simply UNBEARABLE!  It makes the DVD unwatchable.  Soumds like it was re-recorded in the stairwell of the theatre where they ripped it off.,1494288000,,164,4.620689655172414
8278063,5,B001AMZ1W4,"I have all ways enjoyed this movie, a truly great cast and movie, with Douglas Fairbanks Jr & the rest.",1370649600,,103,4.2
8278064,5,B001AMZ1W4,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

It's got Maureen O'Hara, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Anthony Quinn; action, adventure, romance, mystery, and a little bit of magic as well.

For a movie that's waaaaay older than me, it is a lot better than the crud that is put out by Hollywood these days.",1365638400,,271,4.510204081632653
8278065,5,B001AMZ1W4,"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. didn't receive the reviews his father did.  However he did very good acting.  Maureen O'hara and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. seem to hit it off at times during the movie, then not at other times.  This movies tells us that Prince Ahmid was put with the sailors as a young boy by his father to hide him and keep him safe.  He became known as Sinbad the Sailor with tales of his voyages.  With his medallian upon his neck, he sets out to find his father, if he was his father, with the Emir chasing him.  This movies is a delight to watch and teaches that real treasures are in the heart and mind and not is wealth of jewels.",1359331200,2,641,4.213114754098361

8278067,5,B001AMZ1W4,Excellent quality. Was looking for this dvd for over a year. Love old movies as well as current ones!! Would buy again from this company.,1357948800,2,137,4.52
8278068,4,B001AMZ1W4,"A picture to sit back & enjoy. Do not worry about the plot, but just sit & watch the action and that color. A picture to showcase Fairbanks successed on every kevel. Great fun.",1355097600,,176,4.205882352941177
8278069,2,B001AMZ1W4,I bought this Import because this movie is so hard to find at a fair price! This version is of lower quality than my vhs I was trying to replace the sound is bad it sounds like they are speaking into tin cans the color is worse than my vhs this dvd imports color is washed out and the pan and scan makes the faces fuzzy and picsilated and blocky needless to say i'm hanging onto my higher quality vhs. Why is such a popular movie so difficult to obtain at a sane price there is obviously still a strong public demand for this film and both leads are very collectable stars? You would think they would digitaly remaster it in wide screen offer it for a reasonable price for such a old movie and still be able to make a mint. Same with the spanish main another great old Maureen O'Hara swashbuckler thats near impossible to get your hands on at a fair price. These movies are so old you should be able to buy one dvd with four of these old films on them for five bucks at wal-mart that way our kids could see what good clean entertainment is all about. Instead you search for months to find a cheaply made import for outrageous prices. these movies are so old there probable intered into public domain its probably not even illegal to down load them. O'well so I paid to much for a crapally made great classic movie at least I can sleep well. Hopefully I will have discouraged someone from making the same mistake I made maybe with paitience I will run across a well made widescreen digitally remastered version of this film some where. Sorry I couldn't make this review fun at least I won't have constipation issues after buying this because someone sure bored me a new one.,1351468800,,1673,4.3312101910828025
