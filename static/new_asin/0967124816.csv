172689,5,0967124816,"I'm not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre.  However, most of the drills that I used with my team were effective.  This video is for the first or second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter).  They are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough. The narrator uses the expression ""dual purpose"" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills.  For instance, a drill with 3 players, one shooter, one rebounder and one passer.  A simple drill but after the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot.  The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the passer is already passing the ball.  Thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it worked great!  Other drills also worked well like ""shots across the lane"" and a few of the rebounding drills.  The explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's and 0's.  Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video.  The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long.  The sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach.  The video could have been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth, it gives you just what it says.  Some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy.",998352000,24,1784,4.53125
172690,5,0967124816,"I have faithfully used this video over the course of a CYO basketball season consisting of 12 year old boys and saw visible results.  This has been my third year coaching and I have taken bits & pieces from books and videos through the course of each season to help me in organizing the offense, defense and practices.  This has become my favorite resource for practices and some individual skills. Out of the 48 drills, I rotated using about five or six at each of our practices.  The results were positive.  Toward the middle of the season, I knew which of the drills worked best for my team and which ones they enjoyed most.  There are also numerous tips that coaches wil find useful.  Our team's favorite drills were the creative shooting drills.  There were probably 20-22 of them.  All in all I would say this is very worthwhile to the following: parents, youth coaches with kids ages 8-16,and middle school coaches.  What this video may lack is absolute perfect basketball technique, but it makes up two fold in overall creativity and usefulness.  Great value!",998265600,26,1067,4.718918918918919
172691,5,0967124816,"Been a follower of Coach Schupak after I purchased his baseball video ""The 59 Minute Baseball Practice"".  This basketball video is another great product!  Can't go wrong with this one. I learned a lot and used the drills to run my practices.",988675200,3,241,4.714285714285714
172692,5,0967124816,"If you are looking for some wit & wisdom from a college coach about life, don't buy this video.  If you are looking for some advice from a pro about staying in school don't buy this video.  If you are looking for some 20-minute theory on why the man to man defense is better than the zone, don't buy this video.  If you want 48 basketball drills that seem all to be positive and a video that will stimulate your interest, this is the right  basketball instructional video for you.  Used most of the drills with my youth team and had great success with them.  The underlying theory is to get as many players involved at the same time in drills with lots of repititions. The shooting drills are my favorites.  Just another word, the video is about 42 minutes with 48 drills so it comes  at you pretty quick and keeps your interest.  Diagrams at the beginning of each drill are helpful in the set ups.  Like a Michael Jordan dunk, this is a sure thing!",988675200,7,949,4.3107344632768365
172693,5,0967124816,"When I saw the first couple of drills, a big yawn came.  But this useful video has a lot of merit and gets better as the video goes on.  Warning! make sure when you view this with a remote so you can rewind for some of the more interesting drills.",988416000,2,247,3.92
172694,2,0967124816,"I have seen the video ""48 championship basketball drills"" mentioned on a basketball coaching email list several times. I purchased it from ........... based on that recommendation. I have to say I was disappointed. Sure there are plenty of drills but I didn't find many new ones. Do you really need a video for lay up drills, chest pass, bounce pass, slides, weave etc.?  I have seen and/or use many of the drills already. So I was somewhat disappointed in the selection.
What was also a larger disappointed to me was some of the execution on the drills.  For example, a drill many of you do which they refer to as ""shots across the lane"", has the passers foul line extended on one side of the court, the shooters foul line extended on the other side. Your shooter, hands ready,  sprints to the ball, turns, squares up, shoots. When we do this drill I emphasize the proper foot work (the inside pivot foot - constantly saying ""right foot down, left foot around"" when the players  come in from the right facing the basket. ""left down (pivot) , right foot around"" for the opposite side of the court). It makes a player so much more dangerous and fundamentally sound if they know to square up with the inside foot as the pivot foot and if they can use either foot as a pivot foot. When they do this drill in the video the footwork is terrible and never mentioned or corrected. Also, on another shooting drill where the ball is passed to a player and you run at the shooter, it mentions boxing out but the execution is not there. Oh the passing player may get there on time, and may turn, but there is no box out.  In ""rotation box"" the purpose of the drill IS to teach boxing out, but some of the players doing the drill are not even making contact with the body they are boxing out. How do you box out without contact? I am always looking for good boxing out drills, but again, emphasize the fundamentals. See the player you are boxing out, pivot, elbows back etc. And it is not just the footwork. Dribbling drills with the head down. Shooting without the follow through. Little pet peeves of every varsity coach.
It is not all bad news. A nice feature is that the video does indeed live up to the name and give you 48 drills (not sure about the championship part). They even include sample practice schedules (2 for a 2 hour junior high or high school practice and 2 one hour youth league practices).
So if you are a youth league coach or just starting out, this may well be a video for you to build your video library. But if you have been coaching for many years this is NOT for you. As for me, I'll pass it on to my freshmen coach with mention of my concerns. Hope this is of some help to readers.",988243200,21,2699,4.336633663366337
172695,5,0967124816,"Yessss!  Another very useful, easy to follow instructional video from the team behind the famous ""59 Minute Baseball Practice"" video, which I hailed in my recent book, ""Joy in Mudville.""  These guys know their basketball,too, and these are tips that are fun and helpful for kids and coaches right up the ladder.  You can't go wrong with either ""48"" or ""59""!",978048000,2,357,4.819672131147541
172696,5,0967124816,"This is an excellent teaching tool.  The drills are creative and my players love them.  The shooting and rebounding drills are  terrific.  The teaching points given throughout the video are great.  One of the best things about the video were the sample practices given and the bonus coaching tips.  I found all 48 of the drills to be worthwhile.  The producer of this video  really hit a ""three point swish"".  This looks to be a great find for coaches from the youth level all the way up to high school.  Well worth the value.",977961600,9,526,4.5
172697,5,0967124816,"You can be the most dynamic coach in world but if your practices
are not run correctly, your team and season are doomed. If you look
at the all time high school and college coaches, Morgan Wooten, Bob Hurley,
Bobby Knight or Coach K, each of these coaches break down each
practice by the minute and get as many players involved in every drill.
48 CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL DRILLS is an excellent resource to have and
to keep referring to over the course of the season. I used this program
with my son's travel team and even my daughter's recreational team (with some adjustments).
The video scores big with the drills but some of the techniques are only average.
With this said, this program has to be in your resource library if you
are a basketball coach at the recreational, travel or school level.
Totally professionally done with excellent narration and very well paced.

The production qualities of other videos are generally a crap shoot with spotty audio or limited camera angles. This video has great production value and flows well. Sometimes instructional videos focus only on individual play and not enough team, or vice versa. There is a great balance here. Coaches looking for useful drills will benefit from this program. Often times the instructors speak over the target audience's heads. In this video, the narrator does an excellent job and offers hints if you listen closely.

Our department has purchased a number of these to loan out to all our volunteer coaches for review.  It offers good instruction & explanations of all the drills.  It also suggests the time involved in each drill as well as the appropriate age levels each drill applies to.

It's easy viewing as a sit-down ""watch it all at once"" instructional film, but also works well as a quick reference to a particular drill or instructional segment.  Very well done and a worthy investment.",1231200000,5,602,4.910891089108911

So this is a first rate item. First year coaches will love it.  Dedicated experienced youth and school coaches will also benefit and should do like I did, take your laptop to practice and show your squad some of the drills.

Basketball technique is not the main objective but there is a nice section on form shooting.  Coaches from the youth level through middle school will achieve the most success instituting these drills in their practice sessions.
