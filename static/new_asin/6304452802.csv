877801,4,6304452802,"Paramount Pictures present ""CHINA"" (1943) (79 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Alan Ladd, Loretta Young, William Bendix & Philip Ahn --- Directed by John Farrow and released in April 21, 1943, our story line and film, Shortly before Pearl Harbor, American opportunist Jones and partner Johnny are in China to sell oil to the invading Japanese army ... Cynical about the sufferings of the Chinese, Jones meets compassionate teacher Carolyn Grant while traveling cross-country to Shanghai ... Sparks fly between these strong-willed characters, neither budging an inch. But when Jones witnesses a Japanese atrocity, his feelings toward his customers (and Carolyn) begin to change --- An absolute ripper action film with a great ending! --- This was one of a small number of pro-China films made in the United States during World War II, when the two countries had a mutual enemy in Japan; however, a few years down the line, Hollywood's attitude towards China would be markedly different.

877973,3,6304452802,"In 1941 during the Japanese invasion of China, Alan Ladd plays a hardnosed, embittered oil salesman who sells his goods to the highest bidder.  Currently that's the Japanese and being neutral that is his main customer.  On a trip back to Shanghai he finds himself mixed up with a beautiful American teacher (Loretta Young) and her Chinese students.  After seeing what the Japanese have done to the locals he finds his allegiances  changing, until he finally becomes embroiled in the war.  William Bendix puts in a good performance in the film too.  Plenty of action and dramatic scenes to keep you entertained.  Well worth a watch.",1421798400,,631,4.89622641509434
877974,5,6304452802,This is a hard movie to watch. It isn't the finest in movie making. The last lines seem almost put there to be able to close things out. This film was made to show the brutality against China by the Japanese soldiers. There is a rape scene where nothing is shown except the men going into the room and we hear horrified screams. It stays with you.,1421193600,,347,4.1940298507462686

877976,5,6304452802,"I saw this movie so long ago I can't even remember and it impressed me. Of course it was written during a difficult time in our history, World War II in the Far East, and happily for me I can definitely tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.  No gray areas here.  Alan Ladd comes across as more than a little hard-boiled and cynical. Loretta Young is the mission-driven heroine. William Bendix is the stalwart buddy. In the end, Alan Ladd is what he always is:  the hero.",1416528000,,492,4.326086956521739

878023,5,6304452802,"Made in 1943, one of my favorite Alan Ladd movies when I was growing up.  I have it on VHS and didn't think it would ever come out on DVD, especially since it's never shown on TV.",1400889600,2,179,3.8378378378378377
878024,2,6304452802,This was a WWII film and not much effort was in it other than to support the China theater and how evil the Japanese were. The story is weak and even a good cast cannot save it. I took a chance as I like Alan Ladd. Am sure he had no choice.,1399680000,,240,3.6346153846153846
878025,5,6304452802,Alan Ladd was a great actor. He was very good in this war film. I always enjoyed watching his movie that he acted in.,1399161600,6,117,3.9166666666666665
878026,3,6304452802,"In 1941 China, an American profiteer (Alan Ladd) sells oil to both China and its Japanese invaders. But when he hooks up with an American schoolteacher (Loretta Young) and her female Chinese students on the run from the impending Japanese, his ""neutrality"" will soon evaporate. A combination of wartime propaganda and action movie, John Farrow's CHINA starts off tough and unsentimental but as it approaches the end, it becomes just another jingoistic movie designed to boost the moral of American wartime moviegoers. Ladd has a speech where he tells off the Japanese on why they'll never conquer America that will most likely set your teeth on edge. But with the exception of the three leads (William Bendix as Ladd's sidekick is the third star) and Tala Birell in briefly as a Russian blonde, the rest of the cast are Asian and the Chinese actors are allowed some decent roles instead of the usual stereotypes (the Japanese characters excepted). There's the cold blooded murder of a baby (Irene Tso) and the brutal gang rape of a Chinese girl (Marianne Quon) by the Japanese which must have shocked 1943 audiences. As far as WWII propaganda films go, this is one of the better ones. Arizona subs for China. With Philip Ahn, Victor Sen Yung (THE LETTER), Richard Loo, Iris Wong and Chester Gan.

The Universal MOD DVD-r is an adequate transfer in the proper 1.37 aspect ratio.",1390867200,5,1377,4.859574468085106
878027,3,6304452802,If I had seen this movie before I probably 'would not of purchased it. It was over rated by the review.,1390089600,,103,3.9523809523809526
878028,4,6304452802,"A hard to find classic about the Japanese invasion of China before America's official entry into WWII. It shows a glimpse as to what life was like in war torn China, and to the cruelties inflicted upon the civilian population by the Japanese invaders. Interestingly enough- the few Chinese soldiers portrayed during the aerial attack on the village were dressed in Tommy uniforms, and off course, the Japanese portrayed during the rape scene were definitely made out to be the ""stereotypical bad Japanese"" in the film. the stereotyping of the asians was at full tilt. but at least they used asian actors and actresses for the roles such as the late great korean american Philip Ahn.",1388361600,,682,4.887931034482759

7871390,3,6304452802,"dated, of course.  ladd doing well as beginner.  young being young.  William Bendix better than them all...so much better than later in his acting life when he was stuck on tv with 'the life of riley'.  a wwII  film that taught us to hate the ememy.  years have past and we're learning to hate (new) enemies.  it will never change..",1475625600,,332,4.433333333333334

7871392,5,6304452802,China was released in 1943. It starred Alan Ladd with great support from Loretta Young. A drama about the war in China with the Japanese as aggressors. Fans of Alan Ladd will like this the most.,1465776000,,194,4.416666666666667

In love with Alan Ladd. Think I was 12. ",1463184000,,158,3.9375
7871394,5,6304452802,"The politically-correct marketeers finally made the right choice releasing this 1943 film starring Alan Ladd (aka Mr. Jones, oil middle man) is an action-packed short-lived bit of war propaganda when China was our ally and a very patriotic film with romance (Loretta Young as Ms. Grant first pairing) taking a back seat. Along for the ride is Ladd's steady sidekick (""Blue Dahlia"") William Bendix and a car load of Chinese/American actors who featured in later films (Richard Loo ""Soldier of Fortune""), Philip Ahn (TVs ""Kung-Fu"") and some lovely ingenues (Charley Chan). Alan Ladd appears to be more buffed (six-packs) physically in this film than he was in ""The Great Gatsby,"" which must have appealed very much to American cinema audiences. The Japanese are on the march in coastal China (pre-1941) and seizing any opportunity to display brutality that will be apparent to America shortly. Mr. Jones plays it neutral until his cargo of nubile Chinese students and Ms. Grant are more than threatened. In one act of brutality shown off-screen, Mr. Jones becomes guerrilla/warrior taking no prisoners leading to an explosive climax. Although 80 minutes in length, it is action-packed and sympathetic to the cause. Directed by John Farrow with excellent black-and-white cinematography.",1446854400,,1283,5.325123152709359
