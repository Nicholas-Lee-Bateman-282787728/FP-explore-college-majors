7806770,5,6300222977,"This is a somewhat uncomfortable Greggains workout, but in only 15 minutes, she won't kill you. You work your legs bent over resting on your hands while standing up. Man, this is an undesirable position to workout in, but it works! You won't get the hang of this right away, but you will feel your muscles working in the legs and butt. This workout is especially good for people who don't feel much if any stimulation at all in their hamstrings. I'm like that. I don't feel a thing by standing up and bending my shin back. That's a joke. In order for me to work my hams, I have to be on all fours or bent over like in this tape to feel my ham muscles working. If you're advanced, then use ankle weights to get the results. Greggains knows what she's doing!",1249776000,,756,4.256944444444445
