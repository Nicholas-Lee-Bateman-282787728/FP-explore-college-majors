8211500,3,B000BPNCTK,"As a big fan of Thin Lizzy, I was excited to get this DVD but the sad truth is that it is a disappointment.  Not because of the era, 1983 and John Sykes, but because of the length (55 mins) and song selection.  John Sykes was a damn good guitarist and he is in fine form but the camera work is subpar with too many distant shots.  This show was shot for TV and thus likely didn't have a huge budget and it is evident in the editing.  Had I purchased it for myself then I would have felt cheated, this set is better suited as a bonus disc.  The newly released ""Live and Dangerous"" (Nov. 2007) is a much better deal as it includes the 1977 show as well as a 1983 gig as a bonus along with a CD of a 1975 live show.

  The track listing of this particular show is as follows.

1.) Thunder & Lightning
2.) Baby Please Don't Go
3.) Angel of Death
4.) Are You Ready
5.) Cold Sweat
6.) The Sun Goes Down
7.) Emerald
8.) Still in Love With You
9.) Rosalie
10.) Dancing in the Moonlight
11.) Whiskey in the Jar",1196208000,5,1001,3.9402985074626864
