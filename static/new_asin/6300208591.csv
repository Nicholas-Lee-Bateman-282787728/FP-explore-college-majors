225569,5,6300208591,"Most critics consider the soulful ""La Strada"" to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, but for just plain entertainment nothing beats  ""La Dolce Vita"". From the opening shot of the Christ statue  suspended from a helicopter blessing the City of God to the final close-up  of the Umbrian angel gazing after the debauched hero (literally stranded  very much like Zampano in ""La Strada""), ""La Dolce Vita""  has one scene after another to fascinate on the first viewing or to  anticipate time and again. I'm sure everyone has his or her favorite  sequence: the sex goddess wading in the Fontana di Trevi, the giggling  children leading a gullible crowd to a ""vision"" of the Virgin  Mary, or the beach house orgy which climaxes this study of jet-set  corruption. Corruption is the key word here, and the movie was critized for  saying ""tsk tsk"" to its characters while exploiting their  depravity. The cast (or type-cast) is headed by Marcello Mastroianni as  Marcello, a bachelor who is cat nip to females. Anita Ekberg, a  Swedish-born American movie star, plays ... a Swedish-born American movie  star! On a sadder level, Lex Barker, a washed-up Tarzan, plays a washed-up  Tarzan. The plot consists of Marcello's affairs with a succession of  beauties, including Anouk Aime as a jaded heiress who drifts in and out of  Marcello's life and Yvonne Furneaux as Marcello's mistress, pathetically  attempting domesticity in an unfurnished apartment. Between beds, he  wanders around viewing Roman fever in various locales: a Renaissance  castello, a tacky nightclub (where his visiting father picks up a chorus  girl), and the Via Veneto, crowded with celebrities and sports cars. Rarely  has decadence looked so attractive, photographed in black-and-white  widescreen and hopped-up by Nino Rota's nervous music. (Incredibly, I can't  find a cassette in letter-box format.) Marcello is a journalist who  specializes in tabloid scandal stories. (His sidekick is a ruthlessly  aggressive photographer named Paparazzo -- his plural is  ""paparazzi"".) An intellectual acquaintance named Steiner  (hauntingly played by Alain Cuny) encourages Marcello to pursue more  serious writing, but it is Steiner's incomprehensible act of destruction  that finally sends Marcello over the edge, causing him to fall headlong  into the sweet life which becomes increasingly ""acida"". Fellini  shows the lassitude and futility of these beautiful but blank lives, the  characters bored and, yes, basically boring. So why is the story so  engrossing? I think it's because the director never repeats himself. Each  sequence is a variation on the same theme. Fellini, fascinated by the  circus, knew how to hold an audience's attention; and in ""La Dolce  Vita"" he has all three rings going at once: a tremendous life force,  degeneration, and (in the closing shot of the innocent girl's smile) hope.  All you have to do is sit back with a glass of Chianti and enjoy the show.",966211200,,2939,5.236559139784946
225570,5,6300208591,"From its unforgettable opening image of Jesus flying over the rooftops of Rome to its conclusion at the desperate party that will never end, ""La Dolce Vita"" is a beautiful,  disturbing and mesmerizing film which follows the movements of one tabloid  writer (Marcello Mastroianni in the quintessential role of his career) as  he first reports on and then becomes one of the dissipated pleasure-seekers  among the wealthy elite of Rome. Fellini is at the height of his powers  here, combining the earthiness of his earlier masterpiece, ""La  Strada"" and the yet-to-come surrealism of ""Juliet of the  Spirits"" to wonderful and totally satisfying  effect. I have watched it many, many times and always find something  new.....in the visuals, the dialogue, the hypnotic rhythm set to Nino  Rota's perfectly jaded musical backgrounds.  One striking image follows  another......the midnight revelers with candles in the crumbling  castle....Steiner's party with it's assortment of strange, self-obsessed  souls....the bored socialite's joyless dance at the club where Marcello  begins his long night......the voluptuous American movie star (Anita  Ekberg)descending from her plane.......the wild dance led by the satyr-like  ""Frankie"" with Ekberg on his shoulder......the ""miracle  children"" leading the crowd on a merry chase in the rain...  I know of no other film that more  powerfully engages mind and senses than Fellini's eternal tale of the  Eternal City, ""La Dolce Vita.""  How sweet it is.",960422400,37,1489,5.524444444444445
225571,5,6300208591,"I saw this film when I was five and it has haunted me my whole life.  I watch it every couple of years to see who I have become, and how my viewpoint of living has shifted. Any sane soul living quasi-consciously  through the last few decades of unbridled mammonism and pop trash may  likely identify with its semi-impotent protagonist, Marcello Rubini, who  wanders the graytone alleyways of dear old Rome in great suits and sports  cars, sporting sexy ennui. Torn as he is between the Idealized Feminine and  the Matronly Woman - and committed to neither, Marcello finds himself  permanently detached from the eternally-themed scenarios that he watches  unfold in whacked-out tableaux around him (sort of like a day in Los  Angeles, maybe).  Yes, it is a Sweet Life, even as dread and the sense that  ""nothing ca n be done"" overcomes the best of us.  Add to this  Nino Rota's timeless score; the best costumes ever  splashed across a black  and  white fresco; pregnant dialogue; and, a devastating vignette featuring  the sad and lonely Steiner and the fate of his family in an E.U.R. highrise  apartment complex.  It's three hours of the most penetrating stuff I've  ever seen, yet totally entertaining and charming, and ofttimes very, very  funny.  In a dark way, of course.",958089600,6,1277,4.814814814814815
225572,5,6300208591,"Inspired by Dante's works, this films stands up as the greatest Italian film ever made. Everything going on today with celebrities, fame, fortune, promiscuity, it is all here. Marcello Mastroianni plays Marcello, a gossip  reporter in the entertainment circles of Rome. The film has no specific  plot or trama, and it works more as a compilation of vignettes and  ocurrences all linked by Marcello. The film touches upon the themes of  death, friendship, perversion, love or the lack of it, and fear of one's  self. A brilliant accomplishment.",956707200,2,543,5.125

225607,5,6300208591,Federico Fellini made great films during this era and this is one of them. The Blu-ray restoration on this is surprisingly excellent. No fade no scratches no pops the film is flawless from the 4K ultra high definition Blu-ray restoration.,1493078400,2,238,4.975
225608,5,6300208591,"This Criterion blu ray release of Fellini's masterpiece is a real treat for fans; both the picture and sound qualities have been greatly enhanced providing a real feast for the senses.  This film is full of metaphors and ironies beginning with the opening scene of a statue of Jesus ""leaving"" the city by helicopter as it turns out both literally and figuratively.  We see the ""sweet"" lives of family man, Steiner, who has everything it seems and that of the celebrities that the protagonist, Marcello, closely follows for a living as a reporter and who himself is swept up in the trappings of the high life that causes him to constantly keep his fiancee at arm's length as she tirelessly tries to convince him to choose Steiner's version of the ""sweet"" life.  This almost 3 hour film like any true classic film doesn't make you feel its length.  The poignant scene at the end when a ""monster"" is discovered is my favourite when it appears the young guardian angel-like girl representing his conscience or last chance at making a choice motions towards him as if encouraging him to join her.  Marcello realises there is a great gap keeping him apart from her as he has already irretrievably made his choice to join the ""monsters""; he cannot hear or understand her anymore as he is too far gone.  She then looks into the camera at us; what choice would we make?  Brilliant!  There are of course many other memorable scenes in between of ""sweet "" lives and the desperation of various characters trying to find this elusive goal or having found it are left wondering if that's all there is.  As an indictment of the social and moral state of decline of Rome in the 1950s this film is a true masterpiece of storytelling and rightfully deserves its lofty standing on film critics' lists of best ever films and should be in any film buff's collection as it rewards repeated viewing.

225666,5,6300208591,"Some of the great classic films like Humphrey Bogarts The Maltese Falcon and Robert Mitchums Out Of The Past are driven by their tough guy plotline and so recent viewings of those films left me with the same or maybe slightly stronger admiration for the nuances of their performances. Left me feeling I had made the right original estimation of their characters, had been right in the noir night about their creators choices of persona, and of directors choices of actors to fill the roles.  Not so the film under review which on first viewing I kind of dismissed out of hand, Frederico Fellinis world cinema classic La Dolce Vita also recently re-viewed where the late Marcello Mastroianni played the role of the journalist/publicist/writer/playboy Marcello Rubini in search, well, in search of something (or in his more nihilistic moments in search of nothing but the moment).

Of course when the film first came out in 1960 I was far too young to go to the movie theater and see the production. Moreover even if I had been old enough to attend I would have been warned off the film by Father Lally, the rector of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in the town I grew up in, as a prime example of the decadence of certain films, certain foreign films which dealt with s-x, homos-xuality, s-xual allure, s-xual depravity and the general downside of the universal moral code in the post-war world got mad.  And I would good Catholic boy that I was then would have obeyed. Although having friends, good Protestant friends, who were a little older who actually saw the film and who took away from it an overestimation of its sexual scenes I had an intense curiosity about the film. About the sexual cavorting aspects (the scene of Marcello and his lady making love, not seen on screen, in some hookers apartment, boffing some artist, the orgy in the last scene with some high society woman doing a strip-tease, and so on. Stuff young guys would think about in their more vivid imagination moments and that other guys would make sure they recounted, okay).

A few years later when I did see the film for the first time I took away that same estimation about the subject matter at hand, sex, the night time is the right time nightlife, life among the jet set of Italy (or from the look of the planes in the film the propeller set) in the post-World War II Italy period. Liked the film for its portrayal of the decadent night life, liked the strange ways that this crowd spent it time and the willingness to live fast, die young, and make a good death in the time of the worldwide red scare Cold war night where the vast bulk of humankind was being held hostage to the trigger-happiness of distant ghost-like figures. Liked Marcello as a cool, max daddy role model who hung around with good-looking women who seemed ready, more than ready to indulge his sexual wishes, hung around with an odd assortment of characters who were living for the moment, a sentiment I very much wanted to share. I even took to imitating the shrug featured in the film by many characters including Marcello when asked a question about anything not of the moment (or maybe of more than the moment but that was the response in the time of the world-wide shrug).  See, I was at least partially trying to live out that same idea in the free fall 1960s.

So I was then less interested, much less interested, in some of the themes Fellini was trying to get across on the screen, especially in the free form portrayal of the wayward Marcello. Had treated Marcello like Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe as a cool character. So missed or ignored themes like the tension between Marcellos job as a low threshold scandal sheet reporter and his literary intellectual ambitions, the tension between his desire for some kind of serious monogamous relationship with a woman and his endlessly and constantly playing the field, the tension between the seemingly frivolous lifestyle chooses of the glitterati that he hung out with in Italy and his desires for relevance. Maybe that reflects a certain aging/maturation process on my part (although I still though Anita Ekbergs role as the American actress Sylvia dancing and cavorting was a highlight of the film as eye candy entertainment as much as I did as a young man) that saw Marcello as a guy who was between a rock and a hard place in trying to make his way in the world.

Like a lot of guys, guys like me, gals too, Marcello took the wrong road, wrong road for him when late in the film he, older then, was still hanging around with the jet set, with the decadents, and had made his peace with that decision. The ending of the film was a perfect expression of that decision, set that decision in immortal stone, as he and some others who were attending an all-night orgy went down to the seashore to see some dead sea monster dragged out of the ocean from a fishermans net. Down the shoreline he saw a young waitress he had met previously, several years before when he had been making a last ditch effort to become a literary light. As they tried to communicate and couldn't due to the sound of our mother the sea drowning them out he gave her a perfect shrug-off as he walked back to join his fellow partyers. Beautiful finish, the essential existential moment. One of my top ten favorite films of all time.",1469232000,,5316,4.59536354056902

225759,2,6300208591,"I love La dolce vita and I rate it 5 stars. I am a big Fellini fan and I like his style. I totally disagree with the people who call it ""dated"", ""aged"" compared to today's movie standards. Let me tell you that, today's movies have neither standards nor style. Fellini is from a period where cinema was an art form and directors could try new styles. As for the subject, I see no reason why you would cal it ""irrelevant"". Has the media got any better? Isn't the media still a big circus? Aren't Hollywood stars of today living senselessly in a hedonistic world? Oh wait, this movie takes place in Italy - is that the reason why it wouldn't be relevant?

Criterion did a magnificent job with the Blu-ray transfer. There is a detailed information about the condition of the original film elements and what was done to transfer the film to Blu-ray format. This information comes up in the beginning before the film starts and also written on the booklet. You cannot tell that the film was in such a bad condition. It looks pristine, crystal clear.

So why 2 stars for a 5-star film and 5-star Blu-ray transfer? Here is why: I hate when they don't provide English subtitles in foreign movies when English language is spoken. There are foreign movies that contain the foreign language (in this case Italian) and English language because some of the characters speak English language in certain parts of the movie. In La dolce vita, there are actually quite a few scenes where characters speak English. And there are no subtitles for those scenes. If you are hard of hearing, you will definitely miss the meaning of those scenes and lack of English subtitles will ruin your enjoyment of the movie. The DVD production companies assume that only the foreign language needs to be subtitled. Ironically, if the movie is completely English, those production companies do provide English subtitles. So why not provide English subtitles when the movie has dual language? I would not make a big deal of this flaw but I hold Criterion to high standards. Criterion brand is reputable brand and they always release wonderful movies. I expect Criterion to do better.

My other complaint is for the booklet inside the DVD. I noticed that recent Criterion releases provide foldout booklet instead of a regular booklet. I hate the foldout. I guess someone at Criterion decided to cut some costs (I think booklets are more costly to print) so they decided to change the format to foldout. You have to unfold the entire thing which is huge. It is not inducive to reading. I always loved reading the booklets that came with Criterion movies but I find myself reading them less and less because I hate the foldout format. Time Bandits is another example. I hope Criterion would go back to the booklet format soon.",1432771200,5,2787,4.706967213114754

225837,5,6300208591,"La dolce vita is one of my favorite movies.  Being an Italian 78 year old,
Fellini and his movies are definitely  an essential part of my movie mania.
I love all of Fellini's movies and found that they just don't age.
However, I have found that I am drawn to Criterion because I am now
at the age where I want to know all the ""nuts and bolts"" of his creations.
Criterion does an excellent job regarding this.  After looking at their many
documentaries, the movie becomes bigger and better than without
the documentaries.
Fellini loved people and, thank God, he did not allow the Catholic Church
to inject guilt and prejudice into his attitudes.
The simple people and the variety of Italians (and Americans) whose faces inhabited
the tapestries of Fellini's movies stimulated the plot and not the other way around.
Fellini accepted all people for the persons they were.  Their gift was their diversity.
Plot became less important as he discovered the richness, colorfulness, and beauty of
faces and the people behind the faces.  These faces gave a resonance to the movies
he made.  It is easier to remember the faces than some of the convoluted plots he tries to put his faces.
As the hundreds of watching faces look into our souls in ""Satyricon,"" the effect is to feel that you are actually seeing faces from Roman times
and seeing the humanity and vulnerability of this historical period.
La dolce vita is a more plot-driven movie than most of his later movies.  At this point he knew what he wanted to say.
The fact that this movie put him ""on the map"", shows how effectively he constructed this movie.
In my book, it is one of the most perfect movies ever made.  As we learn from the documentaries,
Fellini listened to people around him and they enriched his vision.",1423180800,2,1769,4.647435897435898

225843,5,6300208591,"There are occasions when you know you are in the presence of greatness but can't quite work out why. This kind of experience is provided by Fellini's classic LA DOLCE VITA. Everything, it seems, has been perfectly planned - from the irresistibly cool performance of Marcello Mastrioianni in the central role of Marcello Rubini, to the wonderful supporting cast including Anita Ekberg, Anouk Aime and Yvonne Furneaux; Nino Rota's memorable score; Otello Martelli's cinematography; and Fellini's apparently uncanny command of the mise-en-scene. Every frame, it seems, has been exquisitely planned, with the viewer's eye not just drawn towards the protagonists, but to the action happening in the background.

In terms of plot, LA DOLCE VITA is relatively straightforward; it chronicles in picaresque terms a week in the life of philandering journalist Rubini - someone who devotes his entire existence to hedonistic pleasure. He has a steady girlfriend Emma (Furneaux) but he chooses to chase after every woman he encounters, even English-speaking starlet Sylvia (Ekberg). The fact that he has a limited grasp of the language is irrelevant; what matters is the thrill of the chase. Fellini makes no judgment on Rubini's behavior; on the contrary, he sees it as part and parcel of ""La Dlce Vita"" (or the sweet life) experienced by most men of his age.

Yet there are limitations to this life; Rubini and his colleagues are always shown either climbing into cars, or dining in cafs and restaurants. Through this technique Fellini suggests that they have a rootless life; the idea of ""stability"" symbolized by a home or a regular apartment is foreign to them. Rubini has a place to live, but he sleeps there infrequently, preferring instead to find alternative beds to crash down on.

In another sequence Rubini encounters his elderly father - someone who had come up from the provinces to see him. Fellini has a joke at Rubini's expense by having the father refuse an offer to go see a film at the cinema (he's seen all the latest releases in his provincial town). Life on screen is not La Dolce Vita: the father wants something more tangible. After an evening devoted to wine, women and song, the father returns to sleep in Rubini's apartment and suffers a mild heart attack. Refusing all offers of help, he goes to hospital alone. The sequence suggests that this is what will happen to Rubini once he grows old; no longer able to stand the fast pace of life, he will become bed-ridden.

Yet Fellini refuses to leave viewers with such a pessimistic message. In a climactic final sequence, he shows Rubini indulging himself at a party that lasts through the night into the early morning; he ends up riding a woman, while indulging in sado-masochistic fantasies that adumbrate the more explicit work of Pasolini, released later on in the Sixties and early Seventies (Pasolini has an uncredited role in LA DOLCE VITA as a writer). Such moments reveal the extent to which la dolce vita can corrupt people, but they also reveal Rubini's visceral enjoyment of the moment; refusing to think either of the past or the future, he simply savors each experience for what it is.

LA DOLCE VITA is the kind of movie which, although lengthy, can be repeatedly watched, allowing viewers to discover new things each time they experience it.",1421625600,2,3321,4.944444444444445
225844,4,6300208591,"Anita Ekberg died last week,so I thought it was time to watch the DVD of ""La Dolce Vita"" (hereafter, LDV) that I had bought around Christmas time.  I had seen ""Amarcord"" recently and been impressed.  There are impressive things in LDV too, but I didn't like it quite as much.  First of all, at a little under three hours, it's a bit too long for its material.  Fellini utilizes a lot of ingenuity and striking camerawork in lovely black-and-white in essentially re-iterating the emptiness of the so-called sweet life that is meat and drink to the tabloid journalists and photographers who follow, and partially create, ""celebrities"" and spectacle.  It matters little to them whether the celebrities are from the wealthy, the aristocracy, the intellectual world, the world of entertainment, or the world of Italian Catholicism: they're all reduced to the same level of temporary, often prurient, interest.  Marcello Mastroianni is Marcello Rubini, a tabloid journalist who still seems to have (or is he in denial by now?) aspirations to be a better kind of writer.  His friendship with the intellectual Steiner (Alain Cluny) is a token of that supposed seriousness, and yet Steiner sees himself as little more than a dilettante and in the movie's most shocking development kills himself and his young, beautiful children -- a statement about his sense that Italy has no future worth living in.  (For the squeamish, the killings take place off-stage).  The sense that a worthwhile future seems to be becoming less possible -- in this case a future of stable affection -- almost leads to another death, as Marcello's lover Emma (Yvonne Furneaux) overdoses on pills.  The effect of these horrors on Marcello is interesting -- he seems momentarily engaged and then seems to shake them off and go back to the empty sweet life.  This is the place to pay tribute to Marcello Mastroianni's diligent representation of a very trivial and finally unlikeable man.  Mastroianni gives himself to it without any actorly vanity and manages to keep us interested (with help from Fellini's camera and pacing) with an empty shell of a man.  We don't know much of Marcello's history, but the scene with his father (Annibale Ninchi) tells us all we need to know.  The fruit hasn't fallen far from the tree.  His dad is superficially likeable and tolerant -- and as empty as Marcello himself.  (In the scenes with the father, we also have Magali Noel as Fanny, an night-club entertainer of easy virtue, who, like Gradisca (Noel's character in ""Amarcord""), is a warm presence.

So again, as in ""Amarcord,"" we have throughout representations of the Italian male as not fully grown-up.  Sometimes this seems to me the fulcrum of Fellini's satirical critique of Italian life.  To the perpetual infants that most men in the movie are, women are either smothering mothers or sexual objects -- and sometimes both in the same woman.  When Marcello kicks Emma out of his car late in the movie, his insult is that she is mothering him (and yet they end up in bed together).  Emma, it's clear from her reaction at Steiner's party, would like to be a real mother -- to have a family life and children.  Of all the women in the movie, she comes closest to seeming to be normal in a good way, and the context she lives in is destroying her (as perhaps it destroys Steiner).  Marcello will bed Emma -- and anyone else who is interested, it seems.  Anouk Aimee is Maddalena, a discontented rich woman with whom he sleeps, but she tires of him sporadically, as she seems to tire of everything.  Anita Ekberg is Sylvia, the American movie star who captivates Marcello (and all the tabloid reptiles) and for whom the Trevi Fountain is just a good place for a midnight wade.  To her credit, though, she's nice to the stray cat -- which is an ironic comment on her brief flirtation with Marcello.  (Aficionados of cat sounds in movies will remember Bill Forsyth's hommage to this sound effect in ""Gregory's Girl"" -- where the characters really are adolescents).

The Trevi Fountain scene is one of many in which tokens of ""ancient Rome"" and its putative grandeur are presented simply as parts of a playground for the rich.  Fellini juxtaposes these with glittery ""modern"" settings and sometimes with slum-like modern settings to at least suggest to us the possibility that something less trivial might be imagined or remembered, even as it is being abused or ignored by the characters in the film.  The sacred too becomes just an excuse for spectacle.  From the opening shots of the helicopter-borne statue of Christ the Redeemer (pursued by helicopter-borne tabloid photographers and journalists) to the scenes with the children who claim to have had a vision of the Virgin (and who then seem willing to ""perform"" their vision for the paparazzi), the sense of religion as little more than a provider of spectacle is made clear, although the ripping of the branches of the little tree under which the Virgin supposedly was seen (with Emma doing some of the ripping) suggests a desperation on the part of some for something more real than spectacle.  And by the final scene -- the party celebrating the divorce of Nadia (Nadia Gray), there isn't much ""dolce"" left, and it's pretty much explicitly brutal, letting us see what has been underpinning much of the carnival of Roman life up to that point.  The comments above haven't touched on all the scenes by any means, and certainly not on the fertile ingenuity of Fellini's images -- there's much to see and appreciate, although whether one enjoys what one is appreciating is another story.

Finally, I think that Fellini had one gigantic failure of nerve in the movie.  When Steiner kills himself and his children, his wife is out of town, and due to return at a certain time by bus.  Marcello offers to go with the investigating policeman to meet the bus, and, of course, as soon as they leave Steiner's house, they're followed by a bunch of scooter-riding journalists and photographers for whom personal tragedy is just another excuse for spectacle.  When Steiner's wife alights from the bus, they surround her like a feral pack.  Point taken -- but the failure of nerve is in not showing us (then or later) Marcello breaking the news of the tragedy.  He has obviously been shaken by Steiner's death, and he volunteers to meet his wife.  How did he handle it?  Why don't we see?  Or couldn't Fellini or Mastroianni have made it credibly consonant with the rest of the film?  I think the movie demands that scene, and surely a film-maker as skillful as Fellini could have brought it off.",1421452800,3,6594,4.818827708703375

What do you like to do most?

La dolce vita. 1960.
This movie is about a grand large scale something, that is actually life.
It's all about the phenomenon that is human nature. The drive to live and exist.
la dolce vita is what happens in the world and in life.

La dolce vita means enjoy the sweet life, indulge in what you love, and that life should be lived to the fullest.
A very keen & clever director found interesting ways to communicate this concept.

Much of the activity in the film involves paparazzi pursuit, drinking, dancing, and indulging
in the sweeter side of what life has to offer.
The movie is directed by by Italian director Federico Fellini.
It's important to note that this is truly a different kind of movie from 1960.
This is a film that will really motivate you to stop and think.

The key player is Marcello Rubini played by Marcello Mastroianni.
It's a role Mastroianni plays well.
He is a celebrity journalist & spends his time chasing famous women, while his girlfriend sits at home.
Marcelo is searching for stories, and further more, searching for purpose.

There are many things that happen and even more philosophies behind what it all means.
Marcelo is living and interacting with a wide array of people.
Fellini had a knack for displaying real life in one way or another.

However it is also the least surreal of his movies, following a rather bland cast of characters through the world of show biz. The subtext of the movie seems rather boring as well. But I don't think Fellini was trying to make a statement, as much as painting a picture of the changing world. Religion is transient, and modernity is taking over with cavalier amorality.  Celebrity is the order of the day, and people can not be bothered with 'commitment'. There are moments of quiet beauty which are very Fellini-esque, and the humor is priceless. The movie runs a bit long for my taste (even for Fellini).

226021,5,6300208591,"This masterpiece by Fellini should rank alongside Seven Samurai, Battleship Potemkin, and Rules of the Game as one of the best foreign language movies ever made. Just calling it the best Italian movie of all time doesn't do it justice. I must admit that I was bored while watching it but I couldn't take my eyes off of it and the reason is because I got caught up in the mania of everything that was going on in the movie. What struck me was how surrounded the protagonist was on the outside but was also lonely on the inside. He was pretty sympathetic I must say. It seems almost as if he is afraid of being bored and getting old, so as a result, he transforms into this outgoing socialite who just can't help himself. The pleasures of the upper-class are just too tempting to pass up. After all, this is the ""good life"" right? A whole lot better than what the poor and middle-class are going through. Although Mastroianni gives an unforgettable performance, Fellini is the real star here. The close-ups and camera angles are all perfect. This is a work of expert craftsmanship. Not only is the movie amazing on a technical level, but it also shows true vision as well. He shows that the rich are just like you and me with the only exception being the possession of money. They do what the rest of us ""normal"" people do for fun: they dance, they sing, they drive around (sounds boring, but in the hands of Fellini even THAT has a romantic allure to it), they sit around and listen to music, they drink (boy, do they EVER), and yes, they have sex (the sex is implied in the movie, it was 1960 after all). What Fellini is trying to show us all is that being rich isn't what it's cracked up to be and even (or in Fellini's point-of-view, especially) the rich can be dull and mundane. I usually like my movies to have some sort of plot. This one does not. It rambles, almost in a drunken kind of sense, but that is part of the appeal. As far as ""rambling"" movies go, this is probably the best one ever made. It just paints a picture, but the picture has a purpose. I recommend a drink or two while viewing. Drink along with the characters. Trust me, it will be an experience.",1371081600,2,2172,4.339066339066339

Later when he acquired fame and fortune he became sloppy-to my taste. E La Nave Va is a good example that Fellini did not care much for his audience nor the critics at this point. I cannot find a real meaning or message in La Nave other than his own philosophy of  'E tuto escrementi'. Nothing is worth anything, I guess once you achieve his level of popularity and wealth you can afford the luxury of making such statement.

Besides the Ekberg scene, there is an attempted suicide, a real suicide and killing of children, and an invalid boy is stampeded to death by a religiously excited crowd. Amidst all this is Marcello, who lives without purpose, and finds meaning only on the banal and superficial, be it physically beautiful women like Anita, or pseudo-intellectuals afraid of facing the challenges of the modern world. The film is undoubtedly enticing albeit sad at the same time. The viewer may be momentarily enticed by the pleasures that Marcello seeks, even including a strip tease by a woman who resembles Elizabeth Taylor; only to be shocked by the tragic. At the end, Marcello remains alive, but the audience suspects that he is not alive in a more meaningful way.

As mid century modern madness comes back in fashion, this should be the guide for those who understand the values of style over substance. Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk Aimee and Anita Ekberg have waited impatiently for fifty years to instruct a new generation in looking astonishingly cool in exhausting decadence. The film coalesces Fellini's direction, a bewildering apt cast, a cinema verite camera style and proto-maximalist script into one of the singularly beautiful visions of the myth of celebrity and modernity.

226038,3,6300208591,"I waited many years before seeing La Dolce Vita. When it came out it was considered very avant-garde and scandalous. It was discussed and advertised as a movie about people with too much time and not enough to do, pampered wastrels. Once the DVD became available I found the price prohibitive and I'm still not convinced that it $35 this movie is ""all that"".

This is a young Frederico Fellini clearly a rising director but evidently not interested in telling any one particular story. I've always admired his willingness to use people and places that are not obviously Hollywood perfect faces or perfect sets. Marcello Mastroianni is young, handsome, performs well but, ultimately his character is not very likable. One wonders if this character is worth so much of our time. Anita Ekberg is also young more than just beautiful also performs as directed but if you haven't figured it out yet the story is such a muddle it's hard to judge why any performer is doing anything.

The opening scene is brilliantly conceived. A helicopter, a rather exotic piece of equipment given that this film was shot in 1961 is tracked as it flies over Rome carrying a statue of Christ only to have the news photographers flying in trail and led by Mastroianni get distracted by the sight of bikini'ed bathing beauties. The imagery of religion, tradition and history in conflict with the pleasures of the flesh, compromises of modern times and so forth, were probably very new and exciting concepts for the motion picture goer of 50 years ago. Parenthetically this same opening is brilliantly satirized by Steve Martin in his opening of LA Story.

From here on the movie turns into a series of short more or less connected scenes mostly of the womanizing time waster played by Mastroianni, the various hangar on'ers, actors and actresses alternately emoting and posing and enjoying the good life while not being very happy. Again very experimental and perhaps very exciting 50 years ago. I found all of this a mix of sometimes interesting visuals and storyline and sometimes wishing Fellini would get on and get over with it.
La Dolce Vita is one of the classics and will hold its place on that list with or without my support. A student of film, a serious collector or simply a more thoughtful viewer is justified in considering this film. In this case I am not in any of those categories.",1359072000,4,2373,4.782926829268293

226043,5,6300208591,"I have not seen this movie in many years.  Therefore, my commentary is based on a somewhat hazy recollection about a movie that would merit a few class discussions in a college-level film course.  The movie begins, ironically, with a helicopter toting a statue of Christ above Rome, I suppose not too far from Vatican City. The helicopter scene is in contrast to the decadence and hypocricy with which the protagonist, a tabloid reporter played by Mastroianni, in time realizes he must struggle.  Casting Anita Ekberg as an emblem of what is decadent and almost sordid was an intelligent decision by Fellini.

In due course, the protagonist comes to understand that he exists (does not really live) in a world of no values.  The Ekberg character is an object of fan worship, and ultimately, emptiness.  She is a mere idol.  In time, the Mastroianni character meets a very young woman waitress who serves him.  He seems to see in her a decency that is foreign to the world he inhabits, a world of popularity, materialism, the jet set, and parties.  At the end of the movie, he is on the beach and again sees the young woman in the distance,  I believe with her family if my memory is correct. I view the ending as one of hope, because the Mastroianni character fully realizes that the beauty and appreciation of life is in innocense and decency rather than debauchery, materialism and empty self-gratification.  There is hope for this individual.

The film's message is still timely.  In the 1980s, the public was treated to ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" which attempted to engender envy about the lives of entertainment idols who could afford the best food and retreat to Carribean resorts costing thousands of dollars per night.  In more recent times, there are the reality shows on TV in which in one of the shows three sisters crave what is material and empty and spend much of their time projecting dissatisfaction and jealousy.  In another, three young women lived with a magazine magnate in a world of self-indulgence, displaying themselves physically to garner adulation and a life of parties and childish fun.  The pity is in the inability to recognize what constitutes valid self-worth.  I mention these parallels because La Dolce Vita delivers a message that is, most unfortunately, being ignored.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone as a reminder of the need, especially at the present time,  for a moral compass. A viewing of this film might just serve as an effective reminder, for anyone who thinks, that the current culture has not progressed  from 1961 when this was released.  This is a movie with a thoughtful aspect.",1329004800,,2642,4.839643652561247
226194,4,6300208591,"I had never seen this Fellini film that the world was all abuzz about in 1960.  I do remember Anita Ekberg however as certainly did all teenager boys with a pulse.  As a Swedish-American actress coming to Italy to play, she has her most famous and memorable role.  Her drunken boyfriend in the movie is played by former Tarzan, Lex Barker.  In one scene, one of the paparazzo even says something to the effect of ""can you believe he used to be Tarzan"".

The film is really centered on wonderful Marcello Mastroianni, who like other actors here, may be playing a version of himself.  He's a gossip columnist and full time party boy who is in action from dusk to dawn.  In fact most of the various scenes begin at night and end at the break of day.  Marcello (character's name too) is all about the party and of course, the women.  He lives with one, but cheats on her constantly.  He loves her and others but can't be tied down.  His friend and mentor warns him as he led a similar life at one time.

The movie is sexy, fun, sad and dramatic at times.  Fellini manages to pull it off and adds some wonderful music to boot.  Most of the love for this film comes from the acting and the story, but the technical aspects are terrific as well.  Shot in stark black and white, it includes masterful artwork and cinematography.  Great cars from the era including a '58 TBird and a '59 Eldo, both convertibles, add industrial glamour.  Classic filmmaking.",1325548800,,1447,4.44106463878327

226197,5,6300208591,"I still recall my first couple viewings of La Dolce Vita. I was always unsure exactly what I thought of this peek into the lives of the rich and beautiful... and why anyone would want to make a movie about it (at the time this film was produced). But Fellini was all about examining life, and he didn't consider class in the process.

When I finally bought ""Vita"", in an effort to put together a decent collection of Italian films, I watched it as an examination of life... nothing more or less. Watching in the manner in which Fellini went on record to explain what motivated him to produce films helped. I actually laugh at scenes I had little reaction to before, and I find myself nodding or shaking my head --knowingly-- at others.

More than a film about the rich and beautiful, this is a film about the things with which we want to and/or fill our lives. Because the film has no clear narrative (and life doesn't pass with carefully planned narrative), the audience is bombarded with the unquenchable ""want/desire"" of the protagonist and his crowd. Every once in while we're reminded of the way the other half lives, and what they deem important. With each ""reminder"", I find ""The Sweet/Good Life"" makes my skin crawl just a little more. And I consider how so much of modern society is more like the haves than the have nots.

If you aren't familiar with this cinematic gem, there has been a lot of debate regarding religious under/overtones and numerology in the film. Those debates don't interest me much.

Finally, the digital transfer of ""Dolce"" is gorgeous. I've read about the version with the subtitles on the actual picture. The version I have doesn't suffer from any of that.

226200,3,6300208591,"La Dolce Vita (The Daily Vitamin) has some truly unforgettable cinematography. I was immediately struck by the opening scene of the film where we have the unforgettable sight of a woman with hairy armpits waving at a flying Jesus. I will never get that image out of my head. Then there was the unforgettable fountain scene where Sylvia went wading, and despite the fact that the water was barely knee deep, she wore some kind of floatation vest that was stretching out the top of her dress in an unforgettable way. There was also another unforgettable scene, but I can't remember what it was.

Fellini treats us to what seems like a couple dozen nights on the town with the overindulged rich and famous crowd. Yawn. Wild horses couldn't drag me to any of these parties of the comatose, so I found most of the film to be tedious and boring. Of course, that is one of the points Freddy is trying to make. Point well taken, but it felt like being bludgeoned about the head and shoulders for 3 hours. I did learn that the papparazi have always asked the dumbest questions, it's not a recent development.

At one point in the film, Fellini takes on organized religion and improper pruning techniques in an unflattering manner. It seems that two little kids found a grilled cheese sandwich with the image of the Madonna burned into it and they buried it, and a magic beanstock grew up in this holy spot. Well, all the self serving religious folk gathered around hoping for a miracle while the kids had fun making sport of them. It started to rain, so the holy people ripped the sacred beanstock to shreds with the hope that they could sell the leaves and stems on Ebay to raise money for a new church on this sacred ground. I think there was a deleted scene where they slaughtered the goose that laid golden eggs too. Good times.

At the merciful conclusion of this epic, we see Marcello's character stagger down to the beach to smell the giant dead ray, which isn't a good idea if you've been drinking all night, so he staggers off to the side upwind and sees Nico making gestures to him from across the water. He can't hear her due to the pounding surf. She seems to be offering him salvation from his meaningless life, but since he's hungover and sucks at charades, he gives her a dismissive wave and leaves to find some aspirin. Nico seems happy though. I think she got into typing school.

I watched this film 3 times and listened to the ""expert"" pedestrian commentary to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and I came to the conclusion that some films affect people differently, and this one didn't strike a chord with me the way it did with some others. There is nothing wrong with that, since beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I've heard the Texas Chainsaw Massacre called a masterpiece, so I rewatched that and saw it as a low budget crapfest that was rendered virtually unwatchable by the last half hour of screaming, but I would be flamed without mercy by the fanboys if I gave it less than 5 stars. I would recommend watching this film as a piece of cinematic history, and if you enjoy it, great, but if not, there should be no shame in that either. Different strokes for different folks. I just didn't see it as a ""Masterpiece"" and found it neither that entertaining nor profound.",1264464000,8,3293,4.510887772194305
226201,5,6300208591,"Of all of Fellini's films, this one is the one that most of my friends consider the greatest.  I adore it, admire it and consider it a masterpiece.  I still feel that `La Strada' and `8 ' are his more accomplished works and the ones that I immediately flock to when longing for some Fellini, but `La Dolce Vita' (appropriately, or shall I say inappropriately translated `The Sweet Life') is an outstanding representation of how advanced foreign cinema is from what we experience here in the states.  In 1960 this Italian gem possessed more gusto, more acute sense of realism and more profound intellect than nearly 90% of what we had released stateside.  I'm not knocking American cinema (for I love it) but I am also moved by how much more realism and passion is found in foreign releases; especially those released in the 50's and 60's, before the 70's changed the way American cinema was constructed.

This film basically follows the aimlessness that permeates the life of Marcello Rubini (an astonishing Marcello Mastroianni), a journalist who is striving to make something more meaningful of his work yet finds himself almost `struck' in the world of glamour, prestige and debauchery.  He is blinded by his ambitions, which are lost amidst the glitz and glamour that is splashing itself all around him.  Moving from one party to another, from one woman to another, from one drink to another; Rubini becomes another statistic, losing what makes him distinct and falling into the rut of complete abandonment.

The final moment, on the beach, where he just abandons all hope of change and walks away...I mean WOW.

This film is a complete showcase for Mastroianni, who just runs us through the gamut of emotions with his three-dimensional character.  He delivers charm, wit, rage, depression, sensuality, hysteria, apathy...everything.  Watch the way he completely crumbles without moving a muscle when he realizes what a (close?) friend is capable of.  Notice the way he reacts to his fiancs rash decisions.  Watch the way he completely explodes when finally pushed too far into the hole he is trying desperately to climb out of (that confrontation with his fianc is just brilliant).

He is just marvelous, from top to bottom.

This film is a brilliant look at the way life can encompass and conform you, even when you are fighting fervently against that said conformation.  It showcases the way you can become completely overtaken to the point where your struggle is apparently in vain and you guard is destroyed and next thing you know you have given up and embraced all that this `sweet life' has to offer.

I have to confess that, with the sole exception of Nights of Cabriria, I am not a big Fellini fan, so I approached this film with some misgivings. And the first hour, which includes some dreadful parodies of American movie stars and British journalists speaking very wooden English, begins to feel excruciating. It's this first hour, too, that plays into all the ""Felliniesque"" cliches, with the big-busted Anita Ekberg and the Bacchanalian party scene. All this ""swinging Rome"" stuff seems pretty dated. But then there's a point suddenly at which Fellini's overriding structure for this film - successive nights of partying and dissipation forming a sort of downward spiral in the life of the protagonist - becomes clear and the film becomes increasingly engrossing. The film begins to rise above being a sensational cultural artefact of the 1960s into a real portrait of a disintegrating Italian society that seems timeless and important. In these successive nights, Marcello Mastroianni's character parties with pseudo-intellectuals and decadent aristocrats and fails to make emotional bonds, except for one small, quiet conversation with a teenage girl in a roadside cafe that ends up being, perhaps, his only one moment of real connection with anyone in the entire film. As a reporter, meanwhile, he also spends one night witnessing a mob scene at the site of a purported ""miracle"" (a sighting of the Virgin Mary) that nicely lacerates religion, the working classes who feed on it, and media hysteria, all in one astonishing set-piece that Spielberg clearly looked at when designing the end of Close Encounters. Visually, La Dolce Vita is misleadingly bland and even a bit cheap-looking in its opening scenes, but, starting with the late night odyssey through Rome with Anita Ekberg, it suddenly develops a real visual poetry and vocabulary all its own. It's that rare film that seems to grow in importance and depth as it progresses towards an elliptical ending of surprising impact.

One would imagine that a two disc set (one of them entirely devoted to supplemental materials) would contain everything you ever wanted to know about this staggering, bewildering monument of a film.  I had so many questions when the film ended, as well as so many mental notes to compare against the authoritative opinions of a supplemental documentary, but none were to be found.  While the second disc contains a number of features that wax nostalgic for the film's actors and (most prominently) it's director, there is absolutely no supplemental information about the film itself, aside from an insultingly light introduction to the film given by a man who outright admits to know very little about Fellini.  Even the optional audio commentary to the film was frustratingly deficient, failing to apply any insight beyond the obvious at too many critical points in the film.

A film like this one deserves more -- even just an audio track of a critical essay written on the film while stills are displayed on the screen.

Plus, it is the best written and most ambitious of his films. In many ways, its lead star, Marcello Mastroianni, would play a similar version of this film's lead character, gossip journalist Marcello Rubini, in Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte (The Night), which followed the travails of a marriage over a single night. While this film does not follow a marriage, it does follow Marcello's personal travails over the course of a week full of nights and early mornings- although not necessarily in that order. Otherwise it may have been better titled La Settimana (The Week), or La Vuoto Vita (The Empty Life).
  This film is often coupled with its immediate successor film, 8, and usually compared to negatively by most critics. It's the superior film, however, because, despite being even a bit longer, at just about five minutes short of three full hours, there is not any of the fat that could be trimmed from 8. The later film is also a more personalized Fellini romp, and while some scenes may have biographical import to Fellini and film scholars, they do not work in service to the narrative within that film. La Dolce Vita, however, has no such fat, and, indeed, could have gone on a bit longer without feeling the least bit tedious, for Fellini employs the same picaresque narrative techniques he did in earlier films. In essence, instead of one long nearly three hour film the viewer is watching a series of seven or so twenty to thirty minute long short films with just one recurring character.
  This also allows for a good reason to justify why Marcello's character does not grow internally. He is the eternal troubadour, a modern emotionless Odysseus, flouncing about from one meaningless encounter to the next. That does not mean there are not moments of true depth and insight, and critics who have accused the film of being void of any deeper psychology are just plain wrong. Because someone is shallow does not mean that there is no reason beneath that faade, it just means there's not much beneath the faade- and that can be explained if one really pays attention to the film. In the film's commentary, critic Richard Schickel notes that film critic Alfred Bazin claimed that all of the characters in the film are simply behaviorist paradigms, without any internal motivations. Yet, we see far too many scenes that contradict this stance- one senses motivated by politics rather than art, and because one simply cannot delink one from the other. Behavior is caused by motivation, and scenes we see of Marcello with other minor characters- Maddalena, Emma, Sylvia, Paparazzo, his father, Steiner, Paola- clearly sketch in much of the man's background before the film starts.... The film's screenplay, written by Fellini with Ennio Flaiano, is impressive, not just for its written brilliance, but for the boundaries it pushed open for film as an art form. Nino Rota, as usual, provides a superb musical score. Perhaps only the Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann pairing equals the contributions of Fellini and Rota in creating memorable film scores. The art direction by Piero Gherardi, and cinematography by Otello Martelli, are all top notch, as well. The acting is first rate. Marcello Mastroianni went from a second tier Italian film star to an international sensation on the heels of his performance, and Anita Ekberg became one of the top pinup girls of the 1960s. Granted, her acting is not much, but the other females in the film are top notch, and all the supporting cast do well- especially Alain Cluny as Steiner and Annibale Ninchi as Marcello's father. Thankfully, the film's original producer, Dino de Laurentiis, didn't get his way and force Paul Newman into the lead role, for Mastroianni has a facile quality that the steely glare of Newman could never convey....Some believe that the seven days and nights of the film correspond to the seven hills of Rome or the Seven Deadly Sins. That is not really of import, for great art is never so easily and simply parsed. Whatever the reality is, the fact is that there's never been a better film about the anomy of the human condition- and it's not just modernity under scrutiny, for clearly Fellini shows that the pilgrims at the Madonna sighting, are as lost as any of the modern glitterati, thus implying it is endemic to the human condition, and reflected in the very picaresque structure of the film. La Dolce Vita is one of the great works of art by one of the greatest artists of the last century, and in that statement, there's not a hint of irony.",1221350400,3,4931,4.831952662721894

226320,3,6300208591,"In my quest to see all the great films I've missed by patronizing art houses infinitely less than I should have, ""La Dolce Vita"" just recently came to the top of the pile. I was still on a massive high from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"",  ""Seven Samurai"", a rewatch of ""The Endless Summer"" and my all-time favorite (also Bruce Brown) ""On Any Sunday"" which I watch at least 3-4 times a year. I was LDV's to throw away....

I think I ""get"" the movie... Marcello lives amongst the ""look at me"" crew as a paparazzi and is silently swallowed by their world. In scene after scene, with the exception of his meeting Paola in the quiet little cafe, he descends from being merely a shallow loser to being something worse than that... the kind of evil butt-hole that's too far gone to ever be redeemed.

So I got that... Fellini drove it home through hours of beautifully photographed scenes of easily-bored pretty shiny losers and heavy-handed symbolism... that being a pretty shiny loser is a hollow, unrewarding, waste of your life... duh. All seemingly just to set up a brief ending scene with Paola again... that's about as subtle as Laugh-In's bucket of water.. that if you're a jerk for too long, you just ain't getting back. My first words after putting my time in to this famous piece of cinematic history were ""That's IT?"".

I researched the film more... trying to understand what I was missing. It had to be me because this film has enormous cachet as a film. But the more I read, the more it was cemented for me that the target audience for this was solely the ""film elite""... people who could appreciate film on the mere basis of clever structure and symbolism. It felt like one of the 70's sound effects records targeted at the audiophiles who don't care what the musical performance is like... just how the sound is.. that you can sense the ""sound stage"" and pick up the drummer is also tapping his foot, whether he's playing something great or just a piece of utter musical crap. I used to be one of those guys, so I know I ""get"" that..

If I had to compare LDV to a recent film, it would be The Aristocrats... or perhaps more accurately, to the joke itself. The greatest practitioners of it are those who immerse in and innovate on the nuance of the setup... who can appreciate pushing the length and complexity of the setup to someplace absurd to most people. But I'd say those practitioners are appreciating something removed from the joke itself. They see it as insiders do. It's about the structure (length and complexity), and how other insiders would see it. The insider is their target audience. I enjoyed The Aristocrats myself, because for some reason I can't explain, I'm interested in how the structure/execution of the joke affects its effectiveness. But most ""normal people"" I know were, after hearing the joke, ""That's IT?"". And they came away mis-concluding it was all about the shock value. For them, it was too much foreplay for a really lousy payoff. That's LDV for me. I can check off that I've seen it, and I'll be giving ""8 1/2"" a try in a week of so, but I think I best try and figure out how to like football or American Idle or something my obvious lack of depth and understanding indicates I should enjoy... my career as a film snob seems doomed from this point forward.

More to the point of this review, this Criterion edition meets the highest of the quality standards they have almost solely set for the film DVD.  Any DVD today that doesn't have commentary and features are a rip-off for buyers, but the quality varies significantly (I dare you to sit  through Rob Reiner's commentary on ""When Harry Met Sally"").

Criterion truly understands the film lover, the person who wants to know as much as possible about the film, including the how and why of its elements and the who and what behind its making.  They realize that not only film students are interested in the process and people of moviemaking.  Not cheap, their editions however offer far more value than the usual DVD release.

The commentary by Richard Schickel, a true expert on film, is extremely literate and informative.  His command of his knowledge keeps the insights coming non-stop.  His purpose is to inform and to interest, and he stays right on the mark throughout.

Enough features are included to require a second disk, and I believe this edition contains more than any other Fellini film edition.  Interviews with Fellini himself as well as others involved in the production give excellent background and context to the film and to Fellini and his career.

226387,5,6300208591,"It is difficult to imagine a deeper film than this. Fellini presents several existential choices for his main character, Marcello, played by the marvelous Marcello Mastroianni -- jet-set life (the visiting starlet and its possibilities), intellectual respectability (Steiner and company), religious ecstasy (the children's sighting of Mary), passionate love (the curious fling with Maddalena), bourgeois love (his needy girlfriend, Emma).

As the film exposes each choice as a fraud, a farce, or a disaster, what does it mean to say Marcello is free to choose? He is trapped by too much rather than too little choice -- an elegant encapsulation of existentialism!

Until happy little Nico (of the Velvet Underground)sparked up onto the screen with the happiness and youth of a sparrow. She is grand in her role. She's in the prime of her beauty and she just fits in with the whole nonsense of the film.

226389,5,6300208591,"The theme of this story is the narcissism that causes a group of dissatisfied ""celebrities"" and the reporters and journalists who exploit them to create dehumanized lives in the context of hedonistic materialism.

This story is culturally valuable because it shows us the lifestyles of ""celebrities"" and aristocracy and how standards are formed around those lifestyles. The story reveals a side of ""the sweet life"" that is often untold and unnoticed. It serves to remind us what is truly important, and to break up common illusions and misconceptions about the life of glamour. The final scene, in which the healthy young girl and Marcello, with his entourage of misguided celebrities, cannot communicate illustrates the distinction between the two and their value systems.

The glamorous life is not the only thing about which Fellini reveals misconceptions: common understandings of love and religion are also shown to be ineffective and harmful. The scene of the planned ""miracle"" is one such instance that shows religious superficial and superstitious practices. In one instance, we are shown a group of the faithful ripping apart a sapling tree just because the Madonna was alleged to have appeared in its proximity. This story exemplifies many facets of humanity that are universal and timeless.

The way the elements of style are used serves to increase the worth of the film and intensify the force with which its cultural value is presented. Many of the elements are used with such subtlety that we scarcely understand why we are feeling the way we do until the film is over and we have analyzed it. The dialogue is well-written and telling; however, the other elements of film style contribute as much to our sense of what the film means, if not more.

226390,5,6300208591,"Considered by many to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, ""La Dolce Vita"" is a nearly 3-hour long film that's low on plot; But is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. The film marks the first collaboration between Fellini and actor Marcello Mastroianni (who also appeared in ""8 1/2"").

""La Dolce Vita"" claimed the Palme D'or at the Cannes Film Festival and feels surprisingly modern, especially since it's 46 years old.

Mastroianni plays Marcello, a gossip columnist who lives the nightlife, scoping out various clubs and hangouts while getting dirt on various celebrities. This movie is what gave the world the term ""paparazzi."" In truth, the word ""paparazzi"" is never used, but ""paparazzo"" is uttered many times. Anyway, the plot doesn't follow a linear line of events. Instead, we follow Marcello on what amounts to a series of episodes almost like on a TV show. He meets a woman (Anouk Aimee), with whom he spends the night at a prostitute's house. We see his relationship with his suicidal girlfriend. We watch him meet the Swedish actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), lust for her but never actually get her. We watch as he goes to see a supposed sighting of the Madonna. Then as he visits an old friend...Despite being 174 minutes, I'm finding myself at a loss of words over the actual plot. That's one of the great things about a Fellini film though, the spontaneity.

The script is written by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Tullio Pinelli...To me, the biggest influences on the film are Fellini and Pasolini. It's got Fellini's mood and atmosphere; anyone could recognize it as a Fellini film. However, unlike ""La Strada"" or ""Nights of Cabiria"" it has that same pacing, slowness that looms over Pasolini's ""Salo"" and ""Teorema."" The title la dolce vita translates to ""the sweet life."" The title fits the film so well. Throughout the film, we watch the hopeless protagonist Marcello search for the sweet life. By the end of the film, he has realized that there's no such thing. If you put this film in-between ""La Strada"" and ""8 1/2"" you realize something strange. ""La Strada"" has a childish innocence to it, ""La Dolce Vita"" has a young man transitioning into a world-weary state, and then ""8 1/2"" has that world-weary man in the form of a director. It's interesting to notice; these three films play almost as a trilogy. This is a 5 star film all the way, a fact that owes thanks to the score by Nino Rota. I don't know anyone who could compose a Fellini film the way Rota could. ""La Dolce Vita"" is a masterpiece. It's long, but it's worth it.

Also: A depiction of a man in the brink of having to chose between saving his life and losing his soul, or giving up his life and saving it. What is life without a soul? The life of the flesh, the carrying on of a bag of bones under a low sky, the wasteland, a valley of the shadow of death, a mirage of life.

Here's your choice, here's you freedom to chose. But chosing is hard, so hard we'd like to postpone it continuously. Why has socialism (and its affiliates) always had that appeal towards people? Because its takes away that ""burden"" of having to chose, leaving it to a faceless government, an intricate bureaucratic system that regulates your life and decides your future. You see, God made us free to chose, but not free from chosing.

This film evokes the desperation of life when facing the ultimate choice. Everything is ambiguous, even the title, ""the sweet life"", however bitterseet it really is. The characters, like almost every detail, are symbolic. This film can be a parable.

The sacred and the profane. Christ and no-Christ. The spirit and the flesh. To love Jesus (therefore God Himself) or to love oneself. It's easy to love oneself, to give in to the passions of the flesh and the wickedness of our selfishness. But it does not reward you. If you look deep down inside you (like Marcello does) you will not like what you see. That is called sin. Only the pure (the other option offered in the film, that appears specifically in the persons of the young angelical girl, and marcello's devoted girlfriend) love of God can wash it away. Dare to accept it.

Now, if you are not into all this figuring out all the symbolism of this movie you are going to have a bad time liking it. That is why I give it 4 stars.

226476,5,6300208591,"After a half-century on this earth, life has been a wonderfully delicious mixture of sweet and sour, goodness and disgrace, dashed hopes and eternal optimism. And ""La Dolce Vita"" always ends up as my top pick among the world's great cinema because only Fellini can express this yin-yang of human existence.

Fellini's masterpiece begins with Christ both literally and figuratively being brought down to the level of Man. After three spellbinding hours, it ends with the central character glancing nonchalantly at a large, dead fish - the traditional symbol of Christianity and the ""all-seeing"" eye of the Father watching over Mankind. In between, Maestro Fellini shows us how one human being can inexorably fritter his life away, hoping against hope to overcome a distant relationship with his father, his reluctance to establish a true, loving bond with a woman, and find meaning in his chosen career. In all three attempts, he comes up short, wandering in circles and making a final descent to the sea at morning, an obvious but very appropriate metaphor for the water of Baptism (which failed at the Fountain of Trevi) and a new beginning. When Mastroianni's character glances at the innocent face of the child he had met before taking his final plunge into nothingness, he can't quite comprehend the message, and turns away - a dramatic contrast to the final scene at the shore in ""La Strada"" where Zampano's mind and heart come apart upon his understanding of how he has cast aside real love and genuine human connectedness.

Fellini's genius is in rendering this rich morality play in a constantly engaging set of bittersweet vignettes, shot in exquisite black-and-white and incredibly scored by Nino Rota, that touch all our senses without letup. Nearly 50 years after its release, this often misunderstood masterpiece never ceases to mesmerize on big screen or small.

226479,4,6300208591,"I first saw this movie in the sixties, when its expose of Rome's decadent jet set still had some shock value.  Four decades later, when the mating habits of movie stars are endlessly dissected across the globe, the trials and tribulations of the sweet life feel numbingly familiar.

What's left is the story of Marcello, (Marcello Mastroianni) a gossip columnist, and what happens to him during a series of loosely structured night wanderings.  Trailing Marcello through Rome, we learn his character and discern his fate.  He aspired once to be an intellectual, and idealizes his friend Steiner, imagining that Steiner's life is the perfect blend of serious purpose and family warmth.  What happens to Steiner provides the movie's only true emotional shock. Marcello's traveling salesman father shows up unexpectedly in Rome.  Marcello wants him to stay longer so they can get to know each other better.  But, after a raucous evening on the town, the old man bolts once again.  We see the source of Marcello emotional guardedness.

This guardedness affects his romantic relationships.  There's Emma, his steady girlfriend, who wants a commitment that he's unwilling to provide.  He dallies instead with movie stars, such as Sylvia (Anita Ekberg, whose zaftig charms show us how much standards of cinematic beauty have changed over forty years.)  His most interesting relationship is with Maddelena (Anouk Aimee) a decadent aristocrat.  There's definitely chemistry between them, but neither of them can put aside their party masks long enough to explore it.  His most moving encounter is with a young girl from the country, a waitress at a seaside resort.  The jaded Marcello is drawn to her innocence and optimism, because it takes him back to his younger self, a fresh arrival to the big city.  At the movie's end, after a debauched night, he sees this girl on the beach at dawn, standing on the other side of a channel.  She shouts to him, and gestures, but the wind snatches away her words.  He can't connect to her.  Shrugging, he turns back to his bleary-eyed troupe of nightlifers.

This is a rich movie, and its energetic inventions keep you hooked, even though it's almost three hours long.  As you would expect from one of the cinema's world masters, there's a lot of artful filmmaking here - innovative night photography, a playful musical score by the brilliant Nino Rota, arresting visuals, such as the opening shot of a statue of Jesus being airlifted by helicopter over the city.  Many of Fellini's major preoccupations are on display as well.  His nostalgia for the simple, natural life of the country is played out in Marcello's interactions with the young waitress.  The carnival that is Italian Catholicism is brought hilariously to life when two young children claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary as a way of jerking the chains of their elders.  The adults, desperate for a miracle, swarm to the site.  Marcello and the paparazzi could care less, as long as there's enough spectacle to squeeze out a story or visual.  And the pretensions of urban intellectuals are wittily skewered during a party scene at Steiner's where bombastic people talk past each other in several languages.

Some of the most appealing aspects of Fellini's movies aren't all that evident in La Dolce Vita.  His warmth towards his characters, for instance.  The starlets, aristocrats and tabloid journalists that Marcello runs with aren't very likable.  Without his easy charm, this would be a cold movie indeed.  Also, Fellini is the best there is at using cinematic imagery to create a dreamlike flow to his stories.  But this movie is full of abrupt, even awkward transitions, as though Fellini, following Marcello through the warren of Rome's streets, keeps hitting dead ends which force him to back up in order to go forward.

Although Fellini's starting to move away from his neorealistic roots in La Dolce Vita, he doesn't move very far.  When he finally returned to those roots, he made Amarcord, an amazing fusion of realism and surrealism.  For me, it's Fellini's best movie, and perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made.  La Dolce Vita isn't as good as Amarcord, and much of its shock value has been diluted by time, but it's worth seeing for Mastroianni's seemingly effortless virtuosity and for the privilege of watching a great director capture the passing parade.",1139529600,11,4380,4.983471074380165

Not since Pulp Fiction have I been so captivated by the opening frames of a film. This scene sets the stage for a world not unlike our own, a world of images that is under the constant watch of the God who made it and the voyeurous paparazzis who pollute it.

Marcello is one such photojournalist, yet even his life is not free from the vulgar invasions he commits. He is plagued by an unstoppable sex drive. He can get women anywhere but has no interest in keeping them. This might sound cliched, but this movie is one of the most original films I've ever seen. What sets it apart is the fact that when with a woman, he is truly, deeply in love...for about three days. His weakness is represented by the many terrific symbolic images in the film.

The movie starlet Sylvia he'd fallen for one particular evening basks underneath an arificial waterfall. She comments on the beauty of the sounds it makes and calls Marcello to join her. He does, but only after removing his shoes that he may be entirely comfortable in the wet. He comes to her, reaches out, and...the water stops flowing, the sound is gone.

Photographers clamber for the best angles and the most shots as the two come home to meet Sylvia's boyfriend. They continue snapping pictures as the boyfriend beats the two. They even go as far as egging them on.

The photojournalists continue leeching virtue from conflicts throughout the film. They are never at peace. The only character to have a stable life is Steiner. He's a friend of Marcello, but they never see each other. Steiner lives a peaceful life, and Marcello envies that. Steiner, however, can't stand it. He has a wife and two beautiful children whom he loves, but he feels trapped by his high place in society. Peace is his greatest horror. After confiding this to Marcello, he kisses his children goodnight and laments for how happy he is. We see him one more time in the film, but under very different circumstances.

The film ends with the capture of a giant stingray. Fish have no eyelids so, as Marcello points out, it is always watching even after its dead. A woman calls for him from across a small channel, he tries to make out what she's saying, but the water and the distance make it impossible. In the end he just walks away.

In the stingray, Marcello saw a reflection of himself. He's a giant of personality and a powerful figure. He always watches, but is dead on the inside.

The film is a little too long, but Fellini has no trouble keeping up the energy. I'm sure that everything I wrote and everything I noted but decided not to write only scratched the surface of this amazing film. It's the type of film you have to watch more than once. I'll be sure to watch it again.",1122508800,3,2975,4.496296296296296
226514,5,6300208591,"As ""La Dolce Vita"" came to a close I was of the opinion that I had watched a lesser movie than what I had expected.  However, as the movie kept going through my mind the next day, I began to reflect on what a great movie LDV is.  The problem I had was the bad taste that the movie left me with.  I didn't realize that this was probably the result that the director, Fellini, intended.

""La Dolce Vita"" shows us the life of an Italian journalist who has a knack for being in the midst of celebrities and the social elites.  Consequently he seems to drift from one party to another.  This starts out interesting because he keeps his wits about him; never too drunk, doesn't lose sight of the story he's after, is attentive to those that appeal to him, and carries himself as a leader.  However, we begin to see the gradual decline of his focus and control.  People he cares about seem to drift away from him.  He struggles to write and he struggles to cope with the bizarre demise of the one man whom he truly looked up to.  However, the party never stops and he hasn't figured out it's time to go home.  Ultimately we are generally either saddened or disgusted by the depths to which he has sunk.  The image of the ""beautiful people"" in LDV gradually turns from fun and frolic into a life without purpose.  So many of the parties we are witness to seem meaningless and boring.

As in most any Fellini movie, there are many terrific scenes, bizarre people, and brilliant imagery.  The acting is terrific as is the direction.  However, the sound mixing was as bad as in ""8 1/2"" where the voices and lip movements were so out of sinc that it looked like an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.

""La Dolce Vita"" is three hours long which caught me off guard.  It doesn't seem that long because most every scene seems appropos to the theme of the movie.  I've only seen LDV once and I am sure this is a movie that will deliver new insights each time I see it again.  It may leave a viewer depressed but it may also make a viewer thankful for his mortgage, 40 hour a week job, and his kids that keep him busy another 40 hours a week.  Hopefully, that was Fellini's intent.",1118793600,4,2161,4.286419753086419
226515,5,6300208591,"Everybody wants to live the sweet life, but what is the sweet life? Poor Marcello is trying to figure that out in La Dolce Vita.

There is a Buddhist story that goes like this: a man searches for enlightenment, but cannot find it. A wise priestess tells him, ""When something good happens, good. When something bad happens, good. Give thanks for everything."" The man comes back after three years of trying to follow this lesson and says, ""I still have not found enlightenment"". The priestess said, ""Give thanks for everything."" The man suddenly understood.

Basically, you know, this is what Fellini's films are about. I mean, this is what Fellini is expressing in showing us the world he creates. Thanks for everything. Embrace this life in all its strange, stupid, useless, ridiculous and sublime beauty. His characters cannot do it...that's where the pathos comes in. But, as a filmmaker, Fellini does. Whatever subtext may exist, the basic core of post-realist Fellini filmmaking is this embrace.",1114732800,9,999,5.048484848484849
226516,5,6300208591,"Federico Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA has been tooted as a monumental innovative film for its time.  It's been analyzed inside and out, backwards and forwards, and why the further analysis?  It doesn't hurt to add yet another perspective to previous criticism.  From a historical perspective, by the 1950s ended, much had occurred globally, politically, religiously, socially, and culturally.  This film was released during the height of the Cold War and Communism and Capitalism were knocking heads with one another, Italy was under continued reconstruction after WWII, Europe was getting its taste of rock and roll music, and it was a Beat Generation.  For whatever reason, Fellini opens the film with a statue of Jesus hanging from its seams by a helicopter that flies over Vatican City.  First, this definitely rings out religious change, i.e., the Catholic church lost a leader, Pope Pius XII, but experienced an enormous restructuring with Vatican II.  Fellini may have observed this change within the religious landscape and implements it with intermittent church scenes and miraculous visions that has gone with Catholicism as well as the ""flying"" Jesus statue that reappears through out the film.  There is a small tinge of religious and philosophical overtones that bears similarities to an Ingmar Bergman film, however, without the solemn and brooding approach that Bergman depicts in his characters and narrative.  Fellini's approach is somewhat ambiguous with a carnival atmosphere with ""beautiful people"" who aren't perfect at all, but almost follows the same premise as Bergman - the meaning of life, but in Fellini's case, ""The Sweet Life"".

LA DOLCE VITA a film about love and the absence of love.  Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni), main character, lives the good life, but as an observer, he sees the sweet as well as the bittersweet life that exist with his friends and acquaintances.  Fellini states:  ""There is an effort to show a world without love, characters full of selfishness, people exploiting one another..."" (DVD inner sleeve).  He envies his friend, Steiner, who lives a ""structured"" life with his wife and two kids and the intellectual salon that he holds at his home.  But how ironic, Steiner commits suicide near the end of the film and takes his dearly loved children with him while his wife was away running an errand.  As for Marcello, he cannot bear to be ""tied down"" to a conventional life, and would rather embrace his ""teddy boy"" image and Rome's nightlife by living it up until dawn while he's still young and carefree.  But at the same time, he cannot bear to leave his suicidal girlfriend, Emma, as Fellini depicts this scene where Marcello leaves her on an abandoned dirt road but later returns before sunrise.  In the middle of it all, Fellini includes a scene with Marcello's father who does not want to intrude on his son's life.

Overall, LA DOLCE VITA is a cinematic masterpiece. It has been mocked by television, other movies, and music videos of the 1980s.  The film itself will appeal to art and film students and anyone in between for further imitation and study.  It is extremely long, with it clocking in at 2 hours and 54 minutes, but with so much going on, one will not notice the length of time.  It is one unique film simply was ahead of its time.",1114387200,5,3301,4.952813067150635
226517,5,6300208591,"`La Dolce Vita' (The Sweet Life), written and directed by Fredrico Fellini is probably the great Italian director's best known film, which occurs on more than one list of the top ten films of all times. It is most certainly on my list. This new DVD set is a very capable presentation of the film, including my very favorite feature, a voice over commentary track. As the director and many other principles connected with the film are gone, American film critic and historian, Richard Schickel, does this commentary track.

For those how know nothing of the movie, it is spoken largely in Italian with a few English speeches from American `film stars' played by Anita Ekberg and Lex Barker, among others. The picture covers an indeterminate number of days in the life of an Italian gossip columnist for, I believe, the International Edition of the Herald-Tribune. Schickel's commentary cites eight episodes, most beginning in the afternoon or evening, carrying through that night, and resolving in the early morning light. Aside from Marcello Mastroianni's character, Marcello, and his function as a reporter on cultural and entertainment happenings, there is relatively little direct connection between the events in the eight scenes. They all, of course, happen in and around the city of Rome in 1959, where we see an enormous amount of rebuilding after the end of World War II. As I was in Rome in 1964 and saw many of the locations where this movie was shot, this great construction effort is quite real. Since there is very little story in this three-hour movie, the whole point of the movie is the life and experiences of the observer, Marcello.

Commentators on this movie, Schickel among them, have developed lots of theories about the images, allusions, and statements made, indirectly in the business and dialogue in the movie. And, since there is very little overt sexuality, I have to believe that some of the `messages', especially an anti-clerical message derived from the movie is very real, especially to conservative Europeans. This is probably the easiest subliminal theme to cull from the story, but it is certainly not the only one. With enough thought, I suspect one can develop some pretty cogent themes involving water, food (especially bananas), circular staircases, and animals (especially cats). All this means is that these 180 minutes are one of the richest cinematic environments created by any filmmaker.

Since the movie is in Italian, there are few memorable quotes from the dialogue (although I have an excellent memory of one line, `And to think he played Tarzan', spoken about Lex Barker by one of the paparazzi. Lex Barker did in fact play Tarzan in several movies, and it is he, not Johnny Weismuller who sticks in my mind as Tarzan), but some of the visual images are among the most widely quoted pictures in the cinematic dictionary. Three of the most famous are the opening shot of a statue of Christ being flown to the Vatican by helicopter; the closing shot of the very large dead fish being hauled to shore in a net, juxtaposed with a shot of an innocent girl becoming to Marcello by the fish; and the most famous of all, the scene with Anita Ekberg wading in the Trevi fountain by night with a small cat (oddly, in the movie, Ekberg is never seen holding the cat in the fountain, although my feeble memory would swear to this scene before I watched it again on this DVD).

One of the great things about Schickel's commentary is that since he had nothing to do with the making of the movie, he has no special knowledge of what may have been going on in Fellini's mind when the movie was being written or shot. Therefore, we are perfectly free to object to his observations. And, there is more than one of his observations with which I find issue. One is that Schickel buys into the theory that the movie is anti-clerical. There is no question that the church or some Christian image appears in many of the scenes, but I really do not see them depicted in a negative light. I see that the church is not relevant to Marcello, but then neither is his father or his girlfriend.

And, it is Marcello's apathy towards everything except getting information for his columns and connecting with famous or rich women like Ekberg and Anouk Aimee's characters for inconsequential sexual liaisons. He seems quite detached from Emma, his live in girlfriend, as he seems almost totally detached from his barren apartment, since he can't take Ekberg there, as Emma is in residence.

One thing with which I agree with Schickel is that `La Dolce Vita' seems to have more in common with films from Fellini's contemporaries such as Antonioni than it does with Fellini's earlier neo-realistic works and his later impressionistic works such as `Satyricon'. I would especially contrast it with Fellini's next film, `8 ', which is often considered his best. While `La Dolce Vita' hides its moral behind a veiled curtain, to me the point of `8 ' is positively opaque. I simply have never understood it, while I can watch `La Dolce Vita' over at least once a year. A sure sign of a film worth buying.

One point on which I differ with Schickel is that Marcello is not really a paparazzi. `Paparazzi' are photographers and Marcello is a writer. This is important because this movie was the source of the word, based on the name of Marcello's photographic colleague who probably works on the same paper with Marcello, since they are seen going to assignments together.

This is a truly great movie and I believe it is clearly Fellini's best. It is quite possibly one of the best films ever made. This DVD makes the movie especially worth buying.",1113091200,12,5659,4.790983606557377
226518,5,6300208591,"I did not know much about Fellini but I was most familiar with La Dolce Vita because of the Trevi fountain scene and the term ""paparazzi"" being based on one character. I watched it. The three hours did go by fast. I must first say WOW about the ending. One of the most sobering, human, and symbolic ending I have ever seen. I was literally speechless. The ending summed up the whole movie and without it would have been just a series of exciting yet demoralizing events put on screen. One could look at it with many interpretations but I think it shows a basic reality that humans find it easier to fall into an empty life of sensual gratification than to really try to live with eyes open. However, so many interpretations can come from watching it so be prepared to look at it a different way. Fellini does not try to expose the decadent rich, but addresses them as part of a society that tries to give people an escape from the ugly reality of life (whether it is through hedonistic parties, religious fervor, or artistic pursuits). He doesn't condemn but I think tries to make the viewer think with empathy  and reminds us that we're not too far from the inner rot of society ourselves. The last shot gave the ending a happy note (depending on how you view it) and showed me that there are those who are still passionate and unclouded about life. What I just said could be utter garbage, but it is just a testimony to the power of the film to really captivate and stimulate the mind.",1112745600,2,1487,4.407272727272727
226519,5,6300208591,"This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, a vast panorama of life in all its complexity:  the search for love, for career, for perfection, and the deterioration of all flesh.  It is very much a film of the experience of a middle-aged man:  he has reached his limits, and yet yearns from something more, always beyond his grasp somehow.  At the same time, it is about Italian society in the 1960s, a kind of affluent, celebrity-driven culture that resembles the US is many ways, yet has its own style.  Having lived in Italy, I particularly enjoyed Fellini's humor and savage wit, particularly about romantic illusions.

Every ten years of so, I watch this film and marvel at its depth, at the new layers that I see.  The ending is truly shocking and unexpected, with incredible symbolism.  Many things left unsaid, unresolved, unexplained, creating tension in the viewer and the need to resolve it alone, afterwards.  Along with Bergman, this is a true genius of the cinema.

I didn't think much of the ending, but a day later I couldn't shake it from my mind. Fellini films seem to implant certain images in your mind. 8 1/2 can do this to you too. This is not the sort of movie you have to be an art major to decipher. It's pretty straight-forward and very enjoyable. The characters are well-constructed. Even minor characters are very unique. It's like being transported to a strange world.",1110153600,3,524,4.412371134020619
226580,5,6300208591,"This is a film that is very difficult not to watch.  Once you press play, the DVD keeps you stimulated for three very short hours.  Mastroianni's performance is every bit as good here as it was in ""8 1/2"" but this is a far better film.  Indeed, I regard it as Fellini's strongest.  I am still amazed at how accurately the paparazzi are depicted in the film.  Whenever real life intrudes upon the glossy, soma-drugged lifestyle of Rome's socialites, the paparazzi are there to take pictures and instigate more action.  Their presence sometimes even changes the events they are there to record.  The main character Marcello yearns for a more serious life but the shallow road is the only one that provides constant reinforcement.  The lessons on how not to lead your life are all around him but Marcello is unable to synthesize their meaning.  His life is sweet only at the surface level.  He barely knows his father and barely knows the woman he lives with, but there are always parties, parties, and more parties to attend.  The life is drunken and short, but only sweet for a few isolated moments.  Fellini's message was profound and I hope that future viewers continue to internalize it.",1108857600,3,1189,4.718446601941747

Even Ozu's Tokyo Story seems like Rambo/Terminator edge of your seat action bonanzas compared to these two Italian ""masterpieces"".  Antonioni's film is a bit more cerebral whereas Fellini's is whimsical.  In all seriousness, La Dolce Vita is well made, well acted, and contains some glorious filmaking such as the scene when soft Italian newspaper reporter and platinum blond actress first dance and then she is swept off her feet by a fellow mutant actor that looks like a cartoonish devil.  Perhaps I was just tired and it was late at night when I watched these two Italian films; and the commentaries, although informative, are somewhat soporific.",1108512000,20,764,4.9921259842519685
226582,4,6300208591,"Yes, La Dolce Vita is Fellini's crown jewel, his overindulgent masterpiece. Yet it's definitely not his best work. I'm sure, viewed in the context of the time of its release, it was shocking with its unblinking eye towards high society or ""the sweet life"" debauchery. It definitely was THE film that really made Fellini's name known worldwide but viewed amongst his oeuvre, La Strada or Amarcord are better. Although it is touted as being his best, and rightfully so even if it is slightly misogynistic, it's not one of my favorites.  Running at three hours long it becomes a bit self indulgent and tedious at points.  Some segments are really entertaining while others could have been edited for length. There's definitely a lot to dissect here. It truly is a stunning film but I can only watch it in segments instead of straight through.

What makes La Dolce Vita, and 8 , so noteworthy is its combination of Fellini's neo-realist roots, which he would soon abandon, with his surrealist dreamscapes that he would eventually and wholeheartedly embrace. We have the surreal nightclub scene where Marcello meets Maddalena juxtaposed against Steiner's neo-realist double murder/suicide (if you haven't seen this by now then shame on you!). We have Sylvia's romp in Tivoli fountain paired against Marcello`s neurotic wife's suicide attempts.

The theme of paparazzi (that phrase as fans of Fellini know was coined from a character in the film) and the fascination with high society culture is even more relevant today than ever before.  However, if taken simply for its entertainment value, La Dolce Vita is as visually amazing as most of Fellini's films. Anouk Aimee, as bored aristocrat Maddalena, is breathtaking in a Jackie-O meets Sophia Loren kind of way and Anita Ekberg, as buxom blonde starlet Sylvia, is so very Anna Nicole down to her innocently aware child-like antics. Even 60s rock/Warhol icon Nico is in this too. It's a great starting point for those new to the visually poetic world of Fellini but I can't say it's his best. City of Women, And The Ship Sails On and Ginger & Fred are still my favorites with Juliet of the Spirits holding a close place in my heart, but to each his own I guess.",1107216000,6,2207,4.874666666666666
226583,5,6300208591,"""He who looks for God, finds him where he wants."" LA DOLCE VITA is a thoroughly modern film that longs for certainty and permanence in a world where the edifices of the past are crumbling. A world where love is illusive. Where the sacred has become sacrilegious. The opening scene of the film has a statue of Jesus being flown past crumbling aqueducts, the ""modern"" marvel of ancient Rome. The message is clear: nothing is sacred or permanent. The solution? escapism. And so the alcoholic oracle in the film states, ""the three great escapes are drinking, smoking and going to bed."" What is the point of reflection when a ""phone call can announce the end of the world?"" Indeed, one should live ""outside of passions, beyond emotion."" LA DOLCE VITA is a visual spectacle that is as dazzling as it is exhausting. Too much of a good thing can make you sick, and then you have to ask yourself: is it really a good thing?

Marcello Rubini has a gig as a writer, and along with his photographer sidekick Paparazzo, cover (and often uncover) the night scene of the rich and famous, a surreal experience that usually begins around midnight and ends when it runs out of steam in the wee hours of morning just before daylight. This scene is peopled by the privileged few who want for nothing material and yet are bored out of their minds, plagued by an addiction to ""the sweet life"" which has deprived them of the taste for anything more substantial. Marcello is both a part and apart of this world, and in his quest for meaning, will encounter fantasy in the arms of movie goddess Sylvia(Anita Ekberg); philosophical insight within the intellectual circle of his friend Steiner; spiritual revelation during a Madonna sighting by two young children; commitment from his live-in girlfriend and the possibility of romantic love with Maddalena, another lost soul.  But fantasy awakens by the light of day; intellectual honesty is hollow, contrived; the ""holy"" Madonna is all too human; commitment is a prison; and romantic love is like an echo bouncing from wall to wall until it eventually fades into nothingness. Somewhere in the middle of the film, during  a quiet moment of daylight reflection Marcello gets a glimpse of truth in the innocent eyes and warm smile of a beautiful but unglamorous young waitress, and he is enchanted. In a moment there is recognition and understanding but this moment will pass. Our young waitress will make an appearance during the last scene of the film, calling out to Marcello like an angel through the darkness, but the distance now is too great and he cannot understand what she is saying. After several fruitless attempts to grasp at meaning, he turns around and walks the other way - forever lost.",1106784000,5,2724,4.779193205944798
226584,5,6300208591,"What can be said about La Dolce Vita that has not already been said? Nothing left to say. It's all been said thousands of times and by better writers than myself. So I will approach my review from the historical significance of ""La Dolce Vita"">
  Some think that ""8 "" is Fellini's masterpiece; some think his later works such as ""Amarcord"" are his best and most accessible. Yet others lean toward ""La Strada"" or ""Nights of Cabiria."" But for me ""La Dolce Vita"" is the Maestro's masterpiece.
  It was made at the end of his more realistic period on the verge of his dreamier concoctions. Yet in this film you feel the effects of dreams and the drifting segmented form of dreams
 . The film is set in the most exciting period of the history of cinema. The early 1960's when Rome played host to the film word and was know as ""Hollywood On The Tiber"" a time when big American bucks were pumped into such studios as Rome's Cinecitta to produce films like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Cleopatra"" and Vincent Minnelli's rip off of ""La Dolce Vita, ""Two Weeks in Another Town"".
 At the same time such wonders of the Italian cinema as this gem, and works by De Sica, Antonioni and Visconti were being made. All of this in the midst of the birth of the paparazzi press of Rome. Here in Fellini's film you are shown that world in an inwardly turned and self-loathing lens. A glamorous and hollow world that is not so different from our world today. And in many ways gave birth to the media frenzy we find ourselves encircled by just as Anita Ekberg's Silvia is upon her arrival in Rome.",1104105600,4,1559,4.433566433566433

I was fortunate enough to see La Dolce Vita on the big screen recently.  However the screen size made me wonder: Was Rome really this ugly or did Fellini go out of his way to film in dumps?  The aerial shots of the Eternal City look like nothing more than the ghastly Soviet-era concrete slums that feature in pictures of Russian cities.

Fellini must have been feeling ironic when he titled this movie.  There's little sweet in the life of the main character Marcello Rubini or the beautiful people he hangs out with.  There's nothing solid in writer Rubini's life, no stable relationships, and even his job consists of annoying the jet-setters and pandering to the masses.  The movie starts with him unable to communicate with a bevy of suntanning women over the roar of the helicopter, and ends with him equally unable to communicate with a young, innocent girl over the crashing surf.  Despite all his dalliances Rubini is ultimately estranged from women.  He cannot even figure out his neurotic girlfriend, who is the only person in the movie who loves and cares for him.

Perhaps a key to understanding Rubini is his relationship with his father, who comes briefly to visit.  Rubini admits he never knew his dad who was gone all the time while he grew up.  There is a moment in the film, quite touching in a way, when the father decides suddenly to return home.  Rubino is anxious to have his father stay at least overnight, not just for his health (the dad was unwell after a night of carousing) but also because, I suspect, he wanted to better know his father and fill a void.  He can scarcely let go of the taxi that takes his father away from him, again.

Poor Rubini.  He falls in lust with Sylvia, the eye-popping screen goddess (how did Raquel Welch ever eclipse Anita Ekberg, who played Sylvia?) to no avail, thinks he loves Beautiful Person Maddalena who would be poison for him, can't get along with his girlfriend, and longs for a father that is not a distant stranger.

Fellini falls into an old cliche when he has Steiner, an intellectual and acquaintance of Rubini and apparent rock of good sense and stability, kill his adorable children and himself.  It's always the person you least suspect, and always done as an unconvincing plot device to take a turn or set up a new crisis.  Fellini apparently thought this bit of extravagance justified in order to send Rubini over the edge, or at least into the gutter of debauchery in the final party.  It's as if Rubini is to deny himself or be denied any sturdy human post he can lean on--father, lover, or friend.

I suppose any number of conclusions may be drawn from the movie, including that of there being no conclusion at all but the movie merely documenting postwar anomie and decadence in Italy.  Rubini appears in the end to become one of the society elite he's trailed for so long, whose motto could be ""eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.""  The picture stays with you and leaves you feeling a little hollow. It does have power.  It's well worth watching but I wouldn't think it a be-all, end-all great movie.",1103760000,29,3215,4.590192644483363
226586,5,6300208591,"This DVD of La Dolce Vita is excellent. The 3 hour film is visually overpowering with stark Roman cityscapes. The film is intelligent and complex. The story is that of a young tabloid writer, Marcello, who is pulled between 3 women in the course of the film. Marcello is in a relationship with possessive Emma. She is passive dependent, jealous, insecure and extremely beautiful. He is also the boy-toy for rich shallow Maddalena. Maddalenad is beautiful, extremely rich, but distractable, bored, and amoral. She is opposite of Emma in many ways. Then there is the beautiful Swedish actress Sylvie. Sylvie is the archtypal white goddess. She wears sunglasses during the day and she plays all night by the light of the moon. She is served by a satyr actor in a open air nightclub romp. She puts stray kittens in her hair, she howls with the dogs, she is beyond domination by any man. She ends her all night romp bathing in the Trevi fountains until dawn.

Multiple characters and situations come and go, all revealing the struggle of Marcello to define himself. In many ways the film was like a dream, scenes linked together in a tentative way. The scenes are full of strangers in stunning Chanel dresses populating a world of decadence.

Marcello trys to establish honest communication with his playboy father, but is held at arms lenght by this sophisticated lady's man. Marcello idolizes the brilliant talented writer and composer Steiner.  Marcellow longs to be a serious writer and he is fascinated by the literary intelligencia that surround Steiner and his beautiful wife. But Steiner's inner demons cause him to kill his children and then commit suicide, depriving Marcello of a mentor and model for stability, respect, and the graceful successful artist.

In the final scenes Marcello is totally decadent, partying with the alcoholic idle rich,  aging starletts and drag queens all night long. The sun rises on their party. As the party breaks up peasant men drag a giant dead fish onto the shore. A young 16 year old nymphette waitress calls to Marcello. He says ""I can not hear you"".  He has finally lost his muse, he is beyond the power of women.

Maybe my interpretation is all wet. Who knows? The beauty of this grand dream from Fellini is that the interpretations are endless. It is a masterpiece.",1102204800,2,2311,4.850253807106599
226587,5,6300208591,"For those who have been raised on soap operas, La Dolce Vita may be a movie that is, in many ways, difficult to grasp. As opposed to portraying a central character with either a fixed purpose or definite goal, Federico Fellini introduces the audience to Marcello Rubini, an Italian tabloid reporter who struggles to find meaningful aspirations in life.

Adeptly played by Marcello Mastroianni, Rubini is not the type of leading role personality that many audiences will be frequently exposed to. He is neither protagonist nor antagonist. He is, instead, a juxtaposition of paradoxes. For instance, he comes across as a great Italian lover who has finally found the woman of his dreams, only to rediscover hours later that he cannot commit himself to any one person. Throughout, Rubini constantly puts himself in start-and-stop modes, implicitly advertising himself as a socialite one day only to withdraw himself into utter isolation later in the evening.

From one scene to the next, Rubini seems to want to reach out to those around him, but for some reason, he ultimately decides not to. It is as if he has an invisible wall that somehow separates himself from the rest of society, and the perceived complexities that he either creates for himself or else are created for him evolve and never seem to subside. Perhaps the movie was a parallel to a mid-life crisis phase that Fellini was about to enter.

Near the conclusion, Rubini is essentially faced with a decision that one might extrapolate as a Heaven or Hell option. Either way, it seems as if Rubini will continue his course only to change routes and then pass from one interest to another. One might argue that he is a hedonist, but Rubini, to me, is not exactly that. He is like the dog who loves the wheel and will get up close to it but not close enough for contact.

La Dolce Vita, interestingly enough, means The Sweet Life. However, I don't think that Rubini's life would be described as sweet, but it would not be classified as bitter. Just as Rod Serling's Twilight Zone was described as a world between shadow and substance, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, though not an episode with any fifth-dimensional references, is an interesting portrayal of a man whose role in life seems to fall somewhere between participant and observer. And this facet which, perhaps, plays to the strengths of the movie's brilliance would not be the most useful tool in this age of shallow, Hollywood blockbusters.

All in all, five for five for La Dolce Vita. It is an interesting and highly daring focus on early 1960's Italian pop and underground cultures that might come across as shocking to some viewers over forty years later.

226588,5,6300208591,"It would be easy to write off the movie that launched Federico Fellini to international acclaim as a decadent feast of glamour and vanity that adds up to little (the textbook for my film class does just so). If you did so, though, you'd be robbing Fellini's best, most complex, and most deeply moving film of everything it deserves. A first viewing of Vita was enough to convince me that it's a brilliant film; after seeing it again this weekend I'm kind of humbled at its very existence. Here is a movie that, for nearly three hours, holds you for dear life and then has you wanting it to go on at the credits. Here is a movie that has moments of oddball  recklessness and quiet beauty, both deliriously gorgeous; one that puts its protagonist through hell and back but still gives him hope. Yeah, I could tell you a plot synopsis (gossip columnist (Marcello Mastrioanni) experiences the night life of Rome), but that would be cheating and wouldn't do it justice. La Dolce Vita, though about vanity and emptiness, is a movie of ideas. I've been thinking about it all day, I think I know what he's saying, and I just want to experience it again. And what an experience: the cinematography is graceful (not a handheld shot to be found), the performances surrounding that of Mastrioanni are gleefully over-the-top (look for Nico, of Warhol's 'Factory,' near the end), and the conclusion to which the film inexorably builds is as powerful as it is ambiguous. Yes, 8 1/2 is an interesting film, but its pretention gets in the way. Sure, La Strada and I Vitelloni are wonderful little neo-realistic works, but they seem to just hint at something on the horizon for the director. This is it, the Fellini movie that is perfect in every way. With La Dolce Vita, Italy's most beloved director shows he belongs in the same breath as The Bicycle Thief and The Passion of Joan of Arc when we talk about the best foreign films ever made.

226589,5,6300208591,"Simply one of most amazing films ever made. I am a Fellini fan. I think Amarcord is wonderful, 8 1/2 is pleasantly bizarre and the Satyricon is good for a laugh. But La Dolce Vita surpasses Fellini's reputation, and should stand on its own not as a capsule of a time passed, but as an enduring statement about life itself. The film is, simply put, as intelligent and complex as anything out there. Sure there is a lot of wealthy indulgence, and this is shown with equal parts celebratory awe and biting criticism, but look at Marcello's relationship with his father. Look at the blond bombshell wandering the streets of Rome with a kitten on her head. Look at the final party, in which a tired actress allows herself to be feathered before saying, with true fatigue, ""that was fun, but the party is over.""

Marcello Mastroianni gives a truly nuanced performance, and his discontentment is evident in his every word. With one look, he can make the audience sympathize with his dispicable impulses.

As effusive as this is, I feel that I cannot do justice to the brilliance of this film. Forget Fellini, forget the indulgence of the jet-set, this film is about beauty and love, passion and loss. A good contender for best film of all time.",1098230400,12,1237,4.6438356164383565
226630,5,6300208591,"Although many argue about the meaning of his films, few will debate Fellini's impact on cinema and popular culture. I find it amusing how many people try to find a moral message in his films and characters. The brilliance of his films is that characters  are presented without sympathy or scorn. They simply exist like fleeting emotions. Sure, you'll love, envy and hate Marcello's character all at the same time. That's a lot like real life. Feminists always hate Fellini's portrayal of women as sex objects. Get a critical life! The same director who gave us La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 turned around and made a brilliant film about a middle aged woman's point of view in ""Juliette of the Spirits"".

Returning to la Dolce Vita, Fellini seems as obsessed as we are with the celebrity lifestyle and glitz of the famous. This film is oddly prescient in predicting that mania for the rich and famous. I'll go out on a limb here and say that fans of Reality TV Shows will find La Dolce Vita oddly familiar. Let's not forget the strange photographer who hangs around Marcello named ""Paparazzo"". This cinematic leech is precisely where the term ""Paparazzi"" comes from... Fellini foresaw that bizarre pop culture vulture would be increasingly a participant in celebrity lives (and deaths) as well as a chronicler.

In spite of all this, Fellini's films are fun. He seems to have the unique ability to breezily make biting social commentary, while at the same time showing us all the decadent fun we want. Perhaps the final word is that Life is Sweet, no matter how screwed up it is. Like this film, the best thing is to just jump in and experience it.",1097193600,7,1641,4.671280276816609
226631,4,6300208591,"After hearing about this film for years I am happy to see it remastered and now on DVD. Indulge yourself in this basket of sweetness because the message Fellini conveys is significant.

This film was originally made in 1961 during a time when experimentation was the rage. The movie reflects all that life was during that decade and sadly shows that we haven't grown much as a society since we still fall for immediate gratification. The magnificent Marcello Mastroianni stars as ""Marcello,"" a successful tabloid reporter who finds himself revolving in and around high society in Rome. Within Marcello's heart lurks a deeper fervor, but that passion falls to the seduction of excess. His dream to seriously write gives way to the lure of wealth and fame. Marcello wanders around in dream like sequences where he encounters people of all sorts, all unhappy and drowning in overindulgence. Marcello is loved by Emma (Yvonne Furneaux) but it is a love that exists on the verge of an urgent madness and drives him away. He uses Maddalena (Anouk Aimee) as his divergence and becomes convinced that sex is as powerful as he feels love is confining, but Maddalena is empty and her attentions easily swayed. It is inevitable that Marcello falls for the great American moviestar, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), while trying to rescue her from the paparazzi and her abusive moviestar boyfriend. In the end Marcello discovers his life to be shallow and insignificant and as ugly as a washed up sea creature only to find the appeal of life in the youthful vigor of a young girl's wave.

Fellini is a master at the art of filmmaking confirming the art of his mind with this complex yet extraordinary look at life. His vision can be confusing and even considered misleading if watched with a closed and shallow mind. Look for all the subtle nuances he leaves in his scenes such as the cleansing water of a fountain, the finality of a dead fish, and the gentle exuberant wave of youth. The actors in this film are outstanding conveying a sense of boredom and fear as they go about their indulgences. The smiles and laughter of a drunk only hide a painful reality and Fellini captures the losses with an insightful ability. This film allows you to delve into your own shallow areas of life, the passionate ups and the despairing downs, but if you live right you can walk away smiling knowing that life is certainly sweeter once you learn from your mistakes.",1097107200,5,2433,4.76303317535545
226632,5,6300208591,"La Dolce Vita is the outcome of a crossroads for Federico Fellini as Italian neo-realism influenced him prior making this film, Variety Lights (1950) and I Vitelloni (1953).  After La Dolce Vita Fellini's creations became more extravagant and dreamlike as the films often became some sort of allegorical celebrations to mankind such as the autobiographical 8  (1963) and dreamy Juliet of the Spirits (1965).  This crossroad is heavily influenced by a search for something, maybe happiness, which is depicted through the main character, Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), who drifts from day to day with no particular existential ambition.

Marcello, a gossip columnist, works the upper society creating stories built on rumors supported by pictures taken by his friend and photographer, Paparazzo.  A side note is that Paparazzo's name is the origin for the name of paparazzi that now stalks the famed and fortuned.  Marcello's job has driven him to a soul search as he finds himself short of qualitative accomplishments and good deeds, which leads him in some sort of despair.  The despair is augmented through Marcello's work that provides several opportunities to act upon his sinful desires.  Marcello is led into a continuous negative cycle, as he does something good that is shortly followed by a sinful act.  This is how Marcello searches for a meaning to his existence as it becomes painfully evident that he searches in all the wrong places as his desires leads him astray.

At home Marcello has a heartbroken and suicidal fianc&eacute; that needs his love, but never fully receives it as he desires other beautiful women such as the voluptuous starlet Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) and the aristocratic beauty Maddalena (Anouk Aim&eacute;e).  Despite his desire for other women Marcello longs for the strong connection of a family as he envies his friend Steiner (Alain Cuny) and his seemingly perfect family.  Marcello tries to seek redemption to his wrongdoings by nurturing his fianc&eacute;, yet restlessly he wonders what he might be missing.  This leads him to continue to search for something to silence his internal desires, which seem infinite.

Fellini displays his artistic brilliance as he displays Marcello's lost character through strong allegorical connotation with several different themes such as Catholic values, greed, desire, and existentialism.  These themes are essential to the story as they reflect the identity of Marcello who, in essence, does not understand himself as he attempts to find an answer to life.  Thus, Marcello's own confusion of self reflects his own dimwitted search for a meaning to his own life in places other than himself.

Fellini directed a brilliant film with much to ponder and contemplate as most shots leave most of the story for the audience to reflect upon.  For example, most scenes are left open ended such as when Marcello stays in a prostitute's apartment with Maddalena behind closed doors.  The audience wants to think they know what happened, but they will never really know what happened behind the closed doors.  The brilliance of La Dolce Vita lays in the clarity in which Fellini describes the ambiguous as the complete interpretation of the film is left to the audience.  The result of the cinematic experience is an artistic experience that encourages thought and reflection upon life and self, which is nothing but brilliant.",1096934400,5,3400,5.213235294117647

226635,5,6300208591,"Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" represents one of the high water marks of the Italian neo-realist film movement. It's full of lustful self pity, deep brooding passions and taut undercurrents of transfixed sexuality. The story follows Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), one of Rome's undesirable paparazzi. (* Aside: this is the film that labeled that gaggle of celebrity crazed photo journalists as such.) Seems Marcello doesn't much care for work unless it reads more like play for hire. After chasing down a helicopter that's carrying a bronzed statue of Jesus to the Vatican - and pausing just long enough to ogle a troupe of scantily clad Roman vixens in bikinis, perched atop a high rise, Marcello meets up with Maddalena (Anouk Aimee) at a swank nightclub. She's stuck in a dead end relationship. He's living with the overly possessive, Emma (Yvonne Furneaux). Fellini's direction taunts the viewer with a series of seemingly disjointed vignettes that are captivating unto themselves; Emma's failed suicide, Marcello's tryst with American sex goddess, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a brief pub crawl with Marcello's father (Annibale Ninchi), and a thoroughly tasteless party scene in which Marcello (fully dressed), mounts a woman like a horse and shouts disgusted absurdities about the room. The most celebrated episode is undoubtedly Sylvia's erotic dance at an outdoor club and subsequent swim in the famed Trevi Fountain. Fellini delivers a deliberate sheen to this otherwise tawdry little film, giving it a scope and grandeur that elevates the subject matter to high art. Also in the cast is former Tarzan star Lex Barker as Robert, an abusive drunk and has been which - unfortunately - wasn't far off from his real life situation.

Koch Lober DVD has done an absolutely outstanding job on remastering ""La Dolce Vita.""  The gray scale exhibits a depth of field and superb balancing with deep, solid black levels and brilliantly clean whites. Occasionally there is a slight shimmer in the print but this is excusable and non-obtrusive to one's enjoyment of the film. The anamorphic transfer simply sparkles with a minimum of age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for a remarkably smooth visual presentation. The audio has been remixed for 5.1 surround. Though it's dated and sometimes strident, it sounds much better than anything you've likely heard before. Extras include several short featurettes (most self congratulatory on Fellini). There's also a particularly appalling set of interviews in which stars, Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni seem deliberately photographed in the worst light for maximum ugliness effect. Ekberg particularly looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt and Oprah sans make up and before her diet - stuffed into a dress that looks more like a beach towel. (*Aside: Ekberg still thinks she's 21.)There's also a stills gallery and a restoration comparison that will illuminate for the first time viewer just how much work was done to get this film into its current shape.",1096156800,8,3025,5.24793388429752

I hate to bash Fellini because I do love his films. I have heard people say he's overrated. I could never understand why someone would say such a thing. Now I know why. Because they watched La Docle Vita and never bothered to watch any of his earlier films.
La Dolce Vita is an attempt at delivering the same message that Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura did. I also despise L'Avventura. Antonioni was the worst thing that ever happend to Italian Cinema. I understand that later on in his career Fellini admired Antonioni's films. I think La Dolce Vita was the result of Fellini's admiration for Antonioni. I really wish Fellini spent more time admiring Pier Paulo Pasolini. Pasolini's flims blew Antonioni's pretentious crap away.",1096070400,25,893,4.694267515923567

226639,5,6300208591,"LA DOLCE VITA is neither terrible nor overrated. There is something to be said for the pretty large number of film fans who love this one. It is an episodic film, but that is a feature of much of Fellini.  In several films, Fellini builds his meaning in this way: not so much with a single continuing plot, but with a series of smaller stories that add up to a total collection of ideas.

Maybe the secret (if there is one) of LA DOLCE VITA's appeal is that it's so darned interesting all the time.  This especially applies to the plot concerning Steiner. Steiner is the key figure in the film, apart from Marcello himself, who is Fellini's and the viewer's counterpart. What Steiner represents to Marcello is of prime importance. The young reporter sees the older man as a perfected, idealized version of himself. He longs to emulate Steiner and is convinced this man knows how to live life fully. There is irony aplenty in the entire Steiner narrative. When Marcello brings his wife to the Steiner party, they meet a few interesting, but mostly insufferablty pretentious 'intellectual' types. (the famous Fellini 'careless' post-dubbing of dialogue in this scene particularly amusing: it seems to add to these characters' disconnection from a true self, as though they don't even realize what they are actually saying). Steiner himself associates with these people, yet does not truly seem to be one of them. He feels trapped by his own pretentious circle of intellectuals. When Marcello tell him how much he envies and admires him, Steiner replies:

""Don't be like me. Salvation doesn't lie within four walls. I'm too serious to be a dilettante and too much a dabbler to be a professional. Even the most miserable life is better than a sheltered existence in an organized society where everything is calculated and perfected.""

This gives Marcello much to contemplate for the rest of the film. And Steiner's subsequent suicide confirms the deep suspicion growing within the protagonist that all of existence, as he himself has known it thus far, is fundamentally absurd and meaningless. For this reason the film is existential in its outlook. Marcello is the modern, urban human, trapped in an absurd universe. But Fellini, seems not fully despairing in his outlook. Consider, for example, the significance of Marcello's interaction with the blonde girl in the cafe--she represents a simpler life away from the city and the over-complications of modern existence. Many viewers have missed the fact that it is this same girl who waves to Marcello on the beach in the film's final scene: she waves and is telling something he is never able to hear, so he waves once, and turns back to the empty, inebriated crowd as they speculate about the unknowability of nature, embodied by a monstrous, bloated fish.

LA DOLCE VITA is a great film for the way it pulls some viewers in and forces them to contemplate the actual content of what they are seeing. The film's main theme is one it shares with fims of Antonioni: modern man has become disconnected from the natural world and he suffers because of it. LA DOLCE VITA's visual style is poetic, some of its characters are more than compelling and hard to forget, and its musical score by Nino Rota is among the most memorable of all time.",1095033600,158,3283,4.832740213523132
226700,3,6300208591,"The movie that put the 'pap' in 'paparazzi'.  Fellini's examination of the decline and fall of just about everybody ,God included, was such a sensation here when it first opened that theatre owners who had never shown a foreign film before booked it.  This movie was right at the beginning of a new era in movie making.  LA DOLCE VITA was discussed in newspapers and magazines, in sermons around the country and at parties on college campuses everywhere.  It became so famous that it affected the language and brought once taboo subjects openly into popular culture.  Yet it's mostly terrible.  Marcello Mastroianni in the role that took his name around the world plays a one time journalist turned gossip monger among Rome's wealthy indolent.  Yvonne Furneaux is his neurotic, suicidal mistress and Anouk Aimee is a rich play-girl who casually beds him (in a prostitute's flooded apartment) and casually betrays him.  In the most famous and entertaining sequence Anita Ekberg (in a marvelous performance) plays an actress with former Tarzan Lex Barker as her fiance.  This is the episode with the Fountain of Trevi scene.  Ekberg brings so much energy to her role that she keeps the first part of the movie afloat.  But Fellini treats her and most of the other people in the movie as grotesques.  In the final party scene he even quotes the movie FREAKS.  He puts Ekberg through her paces and all one can think of is:  How DOES she keep the front of her dress up?  In his next piece which was part of the anthology film BOCCACCIO 70 he uses her as a nightmare image on a billboard advertising (what else?) milk.  At the heart of the movie is Alain Cuny as Steiner.  Using Cuny was clever as he had become a symbol of European spirituality.  But Fellini doesn't seem to know what to do with him.  There's a party scene at Steiner's apartment where all the characters are supposed to be intellectuals but their conversation is strictly undergraduate.  (The search lights seen through the windows lighting up the Roman sky are for the premier of the Burton-Taylor CLEOPATRA.)  When Steiner comes to a violent end we're supposed to be shocked.  It's a sign that he's discovered that God is either dead or, worse, indifferent and there's no point in going on.  But these intellectuals are just as shallow as everyone else in the movie so there's no real punch.  Most people couldn't even figure out why this episode was there and felt confused rather than shocked.  Also for the first time Fellini used prople as themselves.  Nico shows up and gives a rather enervated impersonation of inert gas.  The end comes on the shores of the sea, the cradle of civilization, at dawn.  The dawn of a new era?  It is for Marcello.  He has become as nasty as the people he writes about.  Fellini may be saying that the world has gone to the dogs but so did MONDO CANE which did it in half the time.  And he may cluck his tongue in disapproval but he seems to love every dirty detail.  Only Ekberg and Nino Rota's music rise above this ash heap",1091145600,25,3027,4.619136960600375

That was interesting for me, for personal reasons.  But, having just watched it, all I can say is that it left me with an emtpy, hollow feeling.  If that was the point, then the movie is quite successful.  Mind you, I'm not the usual ""simplistic"" movie watcher.  But that was my feeling...",1064707200,20,431,4.379746835443038
226703,4,6300208591,"After a lot of anticipation, I finally rented La Dolce Vita. I was a touch intimidated by the two tape set, and was worried that I wouldn't be interested enough to get through it. But, I popped in tape 1 anyway, with a mingled sense of fear and excitement. Though unsure of what I was getting myself into, I was hoping for the promised unforgettable experience.
As the movie began, I searched for the beginnings of a conceivable story line. Not so much a setting or a character, but of an introduction that would change the story. I searched for this, in vain, for the rest of the film. As the credits began to roll, what this movie was became clear to me. It was not the journey of a man changing because problem A appeared and he chose route X to fix it, like most movies. It was to be appreciated for the gradual change that took place throughout the course of the film. No one event or meeting changed the circumstances for our main character, but, as in life, a series of events that are seemingly unrelated, apart from who they involved.
Marcello Mastroianni was masterful in the role of the reporter, in search of scandals who gradually becomes apart of the crowd he once wrote about.
The movie didn't keep me entirely interested throughout, not only because of its large running time, but also because some points of the ""slice of life"" story were merely dry. Yet, there was an inexplicable feeling of depression when the movie ended...somehow, leaving this sex, suicide and alcohol-driven universe that had at so many points bored me, was like losing a friend. As with all good movies, the minute you are cut off from the world it took you into, a sense of loss is felt.
La Dolce Vita, while not always fast-moving, nor interesting nor funny, is a masterwork of its own sort. It drips of flavor, rhythm, sex and life, while Fellini's camera never once wanders into the dangerous realm of objectivity.",1050796800,13,1909,4.568513119533527
226704,5,6300208591,"If film is a collaboration of people attempting to clarify one person's view of the world -- that of the director -- then La Dolce Vita is the most spectacular example of this paradox that I've seen yet. A series of intwertwined anecdotes, none of which have much in common, outline the sketchy life that is Marcello Mastroianni's. As a celebrity reporter, he walks the line between living a real life and creating one out of thin air, manipulating the people he knows and loves, hiding his emotions behind a veneer of indifference that threatens to suffocate him -- and us -- as the emotional wight of the film swells throughout, threatening to overwhelm him (and us) unless he acts instead of reacts.
Love and sex, life and death, friendship and family, religion and reality -- all are covered here but none are analyzed. To his credit, Fellini is able to evoke more from a gesture, a pause or a heartbreaking silence than most filmmakers can from a full 90 minutes. From the opening image of a helicopter transporting a giant statue of Jesus over a swimming pool bedecked with bathing beauties, Fellini manages to cover a multitude of feelings, desires, questions and fears simultaneously. Personally, my favorite sequences involve Mastroianni's father, whose silence says more about his regard for his son and his own life than any dialogue would, and the scene in the castle rooms connected by echoes, which sums up the frustration of things unheard, miscommunicated and left unsaid. How different would any of our lives be if we could all speak face to face; how exasperatingly perfect a metaphor for the failures of personal communication.
Although 8 1/2 is regarded as Fellini's most personal film and enduring testament, I've always voted for La Dolce Vita as his masterpiece. Understated (if a Fellini film can be), filled with majestic images that burn themselves into one's subconscious while inviting subsequent viewings, bursting with undiscussed passions and intentions, this is a document of a life ALMOST lived. I find it hard to believe anyone could walk away from this film NOT glad to be alive.",1044230400,17,2114,4.941011235955056
226705,5,6300208591,"The is a movie of stunning images that taken together provide a stunning and ironical montage of ""the good life."" In fact, by the end I was reminded simultaneously of Thoreau's statement that the mass of people live lives of quiet desperation and Kierkegaard's belief that the natural condition of human beings is that of despair. There is no plot. The movie consists of a series of loosely or unconnected scenes with little or not attempt to link them. Many of the scenes are stunning. Some are disturbing. None of them are boring, which is remarkable given the length of the film (166 minutes).
The beginning is memorable, with a helicopter flying over Rome with a statue of Christ hanging underneath. A celebrity journalist, portrayed brilliantly by Marcello Mastroianni (the original producer, Dino de Laurentiis, pulled out of the project when Fellini refused to cast Paul Newman in the lead role), is following the statue in order to write about it, but he and his team get distracted by women sunbathing in bikinis on a rooftop. In this and many other scenes, the tremendous gap between traditional and historical symbols of meaning and current preoccupation with mere pleasure is articulated. The overwhelming sense in the film is of the tremendous triviality of these people's lives and the loss of moral purpose. There are only two exceptions in the film: Marcello's close friend Steiner, whose life is a search for meaning and truth, and a young girl Marcello first meets at a restaurant where she is a food server and then sees again in the last few moments of the film. But Steiner's search is a futile one, leading him not merely to kill himself but his two children as well. And the young girl is not merely a symbol of innocence, but of innocence lost, not to be found again. In the last few seconds of the film, after a drunken debauch, Marcello walks to the seashore at dawn. There he sees the young girl across a watery divide. She waves to him, and tries to shout something to him. But her words are drowned by the waves and the wind, and eventually they both smile, realizing that they he will never be able to hear what she has to say. The way that Marcello wistfully shrugs his shoulders is almost an acknowledgement that he is one of the damned. It is one of the most heartbreaking moments in modern film, as well as one of the most poignant.
Rome itself is as prominent in this film as any of the characters, but it is not the Rome one finds in ROMAN HOLIDAY. Much of the city looks not historic or beautiful, but antiseptic, shoddily fabricated, barely reclaimed modern ruins. There are a number of ugly modernistic buildings and a number of the areas look bleak and abandoned. This is all, of course, highly symbolic of the bleakness of the lives of the characters. Many films have discussions like this imposed on them (I think of some of the magnificent parodies in episodes of Monty Python), but LA DOLCE VITA almost demands metaphysical discussion. Fellini is concerned with the fate of human beings in the modern world, with what we have all lost and what we have failed to acquire in its place.
Special mention has to be made of the extraordinary music for the film written by the incomparable Nino Rota, and easily stands as one of the very greatest film scores ever written, as integral to the success of the film as Bernard Hermann's scores for NORTH BY NORTHWEST or PSYCHO or Ennio Morricone's for A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. It is not epic or histrionic, but playful and light, almost ironic, as if to underscore the manner in which the characters whistle while Rome burns itself out.
A spectacular film, one of my favorites ever.  It is arguably Fellini's greatest film, and one of the great monuments of cinema.",1041984000,197,3745,4.665658093797277
226706,4,6300208591,"LA DOLCE VITA presents a series of incidents in the life of Roman tabloid reporter Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni)--and although each incident is very different in content they gradually create a portrait of an intelligent but superficial man who is gradually consumed by ""the sweet life"" of wealth, celebrity, and self-indulgence he reports on and which he has come to crave.
Although the film seems to be making a negative statement about self-indulgence that leads to self-loathing, Fellini also gives the viewer plenty of room to act as interpreter, and he cleverly plays one theme against its antithesis throughout the film.  (The suffocation of monogamy vs. the meaninglessness of promiscuity and sincere religious belief vs. manipulative hypocrisy are but two of the most obvious juxtapositions.)  But Fellini's most remarkable effect here is his ability to keep us interested in the largely unsympathetic characters LA DOLCE VITA presents: a few are naive to the point of stupidity; most are vapid; the majority (including the leads) are unspeakably shallow--and yet they still hold our interest over the course of this three hour film.
The cast is superior, with Marcello Mastroianni's personal charm particularly powerful.  As usual with Fellini, there is a lot to look at on the screen: although he hasn't dropped into the wild surrealism for which he was sometimes known, there are quite a few surrealistic flourishes and visual ironies aplenty--the latter most often supplied by the hordes of photographers that scuttle after the leading characters much like cockroaches in search of crumbs.  Unfortunately, the only release now available is a grainy-looking videotape presented in pan-and-scan.  But don't let that discourage you: even in this format its still a very worth while, very memorable film!",1020297600,20,1822,5.378947368421053
226707,4,6300208591,"Even when I saw La Dolce Vita many years ago, at the time of its first release, I found it hard to take the film's moralizing pretensions very seriously. Pauline Kael sarcastically compared the later Fellini Satyricon to a Cecil B. DeMille epic that simultaneously titillates the audience and inveighs against the wicked pastimes of the rich and famous. Here the reproach seems equally valid. At some moments, Fellini's point of view seems just as naive and shallow as that of the the main character played by Marcello Mastroianni. Worst of all are the sequences devoted to the decline and fall of an ""intellectual"" played--very ponderously--by Alain Cuny. Those episodes made my flesh crawl at age sixteen, and they still make me wonder if Fellini got his idea of ""intellectuals"" from watching Italian soap operas on television. Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte--available on quite a good DVD--is far more demanding than La Dolce Vita, but at least the director knows what he's talking about.
Having said made those criticisms, I would have to aver that La Dolce Vita is one of the definitive works of post-World War II European cinema. The movie has visual style to burn, the use of anamorphic composition has rarely been equalled elsewhere, and the idea of offering a panorama of Roman high life through the experiences of a reporter during a few days remains a brilliant inspiration still today. Last but not least, La Dolce Vita is really fun to watch. Even Fellini couldn't take himself seriously too long, and the best thing to do is to forget the sermonizing and dig the fabulous party.
As a final note, I heartily concur with other customers about the inferior quality of the VHS tape put out by Republic. Having seen the film numerous times in a theater, I too look forward to the day it will appear in a good DVD letterbox edition.",1018396800,7,1843,4.8354430379746836
226708,5,6300208591,"Until Criterion get off their butts and remaster this (and take your time and do it ""right""), ultra-legendary film classic, we will all have to content ourselves with the VHS cassettes: two chunky tapes with semi-poor audio and a grainy picture.
This film is BRILLIANT in every way, and in my opinion, if you have never seen it, you don't know much about cinema! See it as soon as you are able, and if it's been awhile, you owe yourself a treat and rent or buy it again soon!
The VHS tapes will ""do"" temporarily, but considering the  overseas international sensation this film caused in 1960, it's puzzling why no one has released a high quality version on DVD as yet? The 1960's would not have been what they were had it not been for this movie. The city of Rome would not be what it is today if not for this movie. We would not have the term ""paparrazi"" if not for this movie. Why then can we not see it in all its wonderful glory as it was meant to be seen?!?!
I can only hope that the Criterion collection is preparing something BIG and giving this film the same spectacular treatment that Criterion showed to 8 1/2.

226759,5,6300208591,"I first saw La Dolce Vita when it was released into American theatres back in the 60s. Until then, movies were just an easy escape for me, something to do on a Saturday afternoon. This first Fellini experience changed everything. Money-and-beauty-don't-buy-happiness is not a new idea. What is new--still--is how Fellini shapes our experience of the idea and of film as art. For contemporary audiences looking for eye candy, many spots in La Dolce Vita can feel like a bad home video. Every time I watch it, I ask why he left in this pointless shot, that futile business. Fellini answers, when I want you to feel good, I'll make Amarcord.",1007251200,2,638,4.756756756756757
226760,5,6300208591,"My favorite Fellini film, combining the brilliant kaleidescopic parading of faces that characterize his later films with the humanistic neorealism of his earlier work.  Told in a series of all-night parties that each end with the recognition of dawn, the movie tells the story of a tabloid writer who has risen to the top of his profession only to be dragged down because he can't find any sustaining meaning in the glitz and glamour.
But the story line, although more important here than in later Fellini films, is really just a device to put actors on the screen, and nobody does this better.  The cast is real reason to see this; Mastroianni in the role of his life, Anouk Aimee as a bored rich woman, and Anita Ekberg spilling out of her dress as an American actress are merely the most famous - every single performance, even by the most trivial of parts, is astounding and some of the best ever captured on film.  My personal favorite is the clown trumpet player with the balloons at the Cha-Cha Club - in the middle of his performance he flashes one quick look at Mastroianni that speaks volumes.
Unfortunately, the only version I have ever seen is in a standard screen ratio that is obviously badly panned - in a film this full of images there is almost more panning than actual camera movement going on, and still too much is happening off-screen.  This movie needs badly to be letterboxed and given a new subtitle translation - but in the meantime, even if you have to settle for the poor VHS version, just enjoy what we have, from the awesome set pieces like the chasing of the Madonna and the final party, to the amazing Nino Rota score and the haunting organ melody of ""Patricia"".",1003104000,40,1693,4.577557755775578

226763,3,6300208591,"The English translation for ""La Dolce Vita"" as many know by now is ""the sweet life"". And, that's what Marcello Mastroianni seeks throughout this entire film. He plays a thrid-rate newspaper man who writes a gossip column. He thinks life would be so much better if he was wealthy, as does everyone else I know! He wants to be a respected reporter. This movie as with other Fellini movies contains things besides the story-line that keep your interrested. Movies like ""Amarcord"" can charm you with it's style and the wonderful music by Nino Rota. Or, ""8 1\2"" with it's brooding story-line as once again Mastroinni's mind drifts into the past. ""La Dolce Vita"" offers great location shots of Rome. There are many priceless visual shots in this movie, and I don't want to spoil them for those who've never seen this movie. But, there is one I feel I should tell you about. It deals with a hugh statue of Virgin Mary. That scene is shot beautifully. Those who have seen this movie know exactly what scene I'm talking about. The acting in this movie is enjoyable. Marcello as usual steals the show. Our hearts go with his character because sometimes we have wished for the same things. Maybe sometimes you yourself have thought, ""There has to be something better out there""? This movie was nominated for 4 Oscars, in won one for ""Best Costume Design"".

226765,4,6300208591,"After having been introduced to Fellini by the semi-intellectual comic figure, Arne And, I felt an urgent need to become acquainted with his works. The father of one of my ex girl friends was the owner of a Laser Disc copy of Satyricon and I arranged that she and I could watch it together one night. I watched it intensely, but it seemed that none of us understood what it really was about. As a matter of fact we agreed that this film was just another strange art movie with an unintelligible message. She was through with Fellini, but I decided to give it another shot. I went to the local record shop and ordered La Dolce Vita. More than a month afterwards I collected the film and decided to spend my Friday night watching it. This film was a three-hour marathon, but none the less it really thrilled me greatly.
It is about the young writer/journalist Marcello Rubin who - in his search for a story - wanders disoriented around between the glamorous life of the well-heeled and ordinary people who's greatest wish is to belong to the group that is being written about in the magazines. Marcello is highly esteemed by all layers in the society, but he has a difficult time being a set of different persons. He is looking for the ultimate answer but he grows to despise the fake glamorous world and the chosen souls of the intellectuals, who believe that they have found freedom. When the impulsive young, blond actress shows up he begins to understand that simple pureness and truth are the qualities he has been searching for, and this is now what he crave for.

This period is the perfect setting for journalist Marcello, surrounded by celebrities, paparazzi (a word coined by this very film!), debauched nightlife and undergoing an identity crisis of his own. Ambitious and ambiguous, an episodic odyssey filled with contrasts -intellectuals  and hedonists, night, dawn and day, aristocrats and streetwalkers, and plenty of striking  religious imagery. A remarkable artistic achievement, this is not a typical art film, it has Fellini's trademark jovial humor, and no matter how dark, emerges as a truly entertaining work. Everything about La Dolce Vita is iconic -the 1960's Italian fashion, Nino Rota's waltzy score, and some of the most famous scenes in cinema. Criterion's remastered Blu-ray is extremely well done, the beautiful B/W photography is even more incredible than I ever realized.
