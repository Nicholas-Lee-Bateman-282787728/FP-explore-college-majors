1340716,4,B00004CJNP,I enjoyed it. Good story. It is so interesting to see how the film industry has evolved.,1424390400,,88,4.235294117647059
1340717,3,B00004CJNP,"This movie is not bad ... not great either.... but then it has John Mills in it, so for that alone its worth a watch.",1421020800,,117,3.72
1340718,3,B00004CJNP,"just to get the start count above 3 people.  my criteria is 4 worth seeing again, even the first time, 3 is not worth seeing a second time, even in 40 years, and barely worth the time.  this had it's moments, few, and suspense - some, mostly signaled by screeching train whistles so you won't miss them.  More than a 2, barely a 3.  Predictable.",1411344000,,345,4.2615384615384615
1340719,5,B00004CJNP,"Top notch Brit thriller, with excellent acting and well-written dialogue. If you like older Hitchcock flicks like The 39 Steps and Strangers on a Train, you will probably like this; it even has moments of sardonic wit toward the end, very much like Hitch's brand. Like many such British thrillers, it begins deliberately, with a good deal of character development as it introduces the lead, along with the quirky ensemble. Then the suspense builds as the wrong man accused sets out to prove his innocence. John Mills is fun to watch, and the climax is very suspenseful.",1400457600,,569,4.876288659793815
1340720,3,B00004CJNP,"I watched this movie because I thought I recognized the name of the movie as a movie classic.

I found the acting sufficient well done  that I believed in the  characters;  but I did not like the movie as a whole..
Clues from the audience perspective are too blatantly presented. I guessed who the murder and victim were going to be shortly after both their characters where introduced.

At one point in the movie , it did look like from the characters perspective there would be a process of investigation  leading to the discovery of clues and finally to the identity of the actual murder;  but later in the movie,  the process is short circuited and the murder and much of the  murder's future plans are revealed. I found this disappointing.  In fairness, I suppose it might be consider as a means of revealing the murder state of mind, but still I found it disappointing.",1382140800,,875,4.587096774193548
1340721,5,B00004CJNP,John Mills is a subtle and appealing actor in this and in every other movie I've seen him in.  This was a thriller with a psychological drama as a backdrop--great story and perfectly wholesome which is such a relief from the constant barrage of bad language and immoral behavior in most more modern movies.  Highly recommended.,1374019200,6,327,4.821428571428571
1340722,4,B00004CJNP,"A film noir that is a skillfully made, nicely acted, sensitively directed, good writing, & photography - an entertaining suspense film, highly recommended.",1347235200,,155,5.782608695652174
1340723,5,B00004CJNP,"Not a real film noir but heading there, since everyone on the police force, and even his friends, suspect that Jim (John Mills) is the one who has killed Molly Newman (Kay Walsh), and due to a pre-existing medical condition even he begins to doubt his own innocence a little.  It's like the situation of IN A LONELY PLACE, except it doesn't dare go very far in that direction.  What I liked about it was the intelligent writing of Eric Ambler, the confident cool of director Roy Baker, and John Mills keeps his overacting down to a bare minimum in what must have been quite a difficult part when you think of it.

The boarding house where he comes to live is almost a character all its own, far more so than the cheap looking set representing ""the works,"" the chemical research lab where he spends his days.  Was there perhaps a missed opportunity in the fact that his profession never really enters the plot of the film one way or the other?  In today's screenwriting climate that would never have been allowed, for if today you show John Mills as a chemist in Act One, he is going to get himself out of a jam in act three through his knowledge of chemistry--or else, in Act Two, the police would connect the manner of Molly's death with ""someone who knows chemistry"" and the frame would get tighter, tighter.  Which approach is better?  I don't mind the old fashioned kind in which some scenes are permitted NOT to be set-ups for later twists, and they can just be themselves.  This film came early in Joan Greenwood's career, and her throaty, husky voice is reined in here, unlike her later films where she burbled away to such an extent you can barely make out what she's saying.  She's loyal to her man, where in a real noir she'd be a little bit suspicious, perhaps turn away from him as her brother advises her to do.  But not Joan Greenwood.  Kay Walsh has a wonderful role as Molly, and she's not in the movie enough, but once she's gone the film gains from the resulting melancholia of her absence.  She's sort of playing the same part as in her previous film ""In Which We Serve,"" as the attractive and sexually adventurous career girl making her way through life by investigating married men--and paying for it, but this portrayal, with its astrological touch, is richer.",1214956800,8,2282,4.512135922330097

7920386,4,B00004CJNP,"Suspenseful and well worth watching. Love how the movie is cloaked in darkness: from the dimly lit rooming house with it's closed curtains and shadows, to the quiet dreary streets and screaming railroad yards shrouded in steam. And most importantly is the darkness that dwells in the mind of Jim (John Mills).",1452297600,,309,4.961538461538462
7920387,5,B00004CJNP,"This is a old movie made in England who survives a train wreck and ends in a mental hospital for a while.  I won't tell you why.  You will have to watch and see.  He gets out, gets a good job and is accused of a murder because of hospital his hospital stay..I really enjoyed it.  I think you will too.",1447113600,2,301,3.8852459016393444

7920390,5,B00004CJNP,"The character portraits in this film are riveting, with a blend of dynamics among iconic by-gone iconic British ""types"" just delightful. Watching the much-loved and elegant Sir John Mills (father of Hayley Mills) with the angelic Joan Greenwood is itself worth the viewing, but the plot while simple is fun and gives a great groundwork for some early psychological elements again worth seeing at work. I'm a super fan of historical settings, too, and this one won't disappoint, least being the rooming house or the accused Jim Ackland's love interest's giant automobile!",1438300800,,570,5.206521739130435
