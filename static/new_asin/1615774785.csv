7800440,5,1615774785,"Before buying this set, I had already seen the first two installments of ""All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace"" and I was blown away. Adam Curtis is a genius. The writing, narration, archival footage, and editing are excellent. I'm buying the set so I can share with others. Somebody should create a college course based on the series. Even if you think you don't like documentaries, this will capture your imagination if you give it a chance.",1346544000,7,451,4.7215189873417724
