1218646,3,B00000I1OX,I Love the 80's and the many cheesy but brilliant movies from the era.  This movie is pretty good but it can not come close to the king of Ski comedies- Hot Dog.  The best part of this movie is pookig at all the old ski equipment and clothing (a lot of which I owned!),1466294400,,268,3.8545454545454545

1218701,5,B00000I1OX,"just the movie to curl up with on a good and rainy Saturday night.  The late Ray Walston - the ORIGINAL ""My Favorite Martian"" - plays ""Pops"" to a Ski Patrol of immature, misfits and heroes.  SO worth the laugh - and I bet you rewind to see ""Stanley and the Ice Man.  Look out ""Tina,"" there's a new set of legs in town.",1398470400,,318,3.9375
1218702,5,B00000I1OX,I have loved this movie since I was a kid. The ridiculous over the top comedy never loses its luster.  A definite recommendation for a old school comedy movie night.,1391817600,,165,4.5
1218703,5,B00000I1OX,I LOVE this movie because it's funny.  I've watched it several times and it always makes me laugh -- even when I know what's coming!,1390953600,,132,4.28

1218719,5,B00000I1OX,I have seen this movie many times and it's awesome every time. So many laughs. And the bulldog named Dumpster just makes the movie too. Ski Patrol is definitely worth watching more than once! lol I wish it would have gotten released on DVD or Blu Ray.,1363564800,,251,4.361702127659575
1218720,4,B00000I1OX,"It's was hilarious.  Some of the acting was questionable, but for the most part it was a great movie.  On par with police academy movies which were meant to be a spoof....as was this.",1362614400,,183,4.352941176470588

1218722,5,B00000I1OX,"I remember watching this as a kid and loving it. They never made it in DVD form but I'm so glad I found it on Amazon. This is the original and still funny however to see the remake and have more laughs, watch Out Cold.

Thanks for streaming this Amazon!",1346284800,2,253,4.06
1218723,5,B00000I1OX,"Our family loves this movie, we must have watched it 100 times when our kids were younger. The ski stunts are great. Dumpster the dog is hilarious (my son has a bulldog now, I think it's because of this movie)The kids are all grown now and I was hoping to buy them each one on DVD. How can this classic not be out on DVD??? Goofy movies are the best. (I even like Bubble Boy so maybe you should disregard my review)
update: You can get this on demand now (free for amazon primer's)",1298246400,3,481,4.127659574468085
1218724,5,B00000I1OX,"By far, this is the best skiing movie ever made.

It accurately describes a ski patrollers life.

Why this major motion picture is not out on Blu-ray DVD is incomprehensible.",1296604800,3,174,4.766666666666667
1218725,5,B00000I1OX,I really was glad to get a copy of Sli Patrol. I hope it will be released on DVD some day. I Love this movie.,1238112000,,109,3.4
1218726,5,B00000I1OX,"Well this is definitely one of the weirdest snow ski movies I've ever seen.  And when I first saw it, I tried to cross-referrence the characters in it compared to the ones in the Police Academy movies.  It stars Roger Rose, Yvette Nipar, T.K. Carter, the late Ray Walston, and Martin Mull.  Snowy Peaks I believe which is the name of this ski resort is where it takes place, and they are about to be evaluated on their performance, and when Martin Mull finds out about it, he tries to blackball their safety features so they can close down so he can takeover the ski resort and make his own resort,  it's up to the ski resort to save it's reputation and keep it open.  To me, the funniest part is the guy SUICIDE...the guy with a THREE part personality when he does the snowboard, and rocket skis and a lot of other stunts.  The other funny part is when the ski patrollers pull a prank on their instructor Murray because he's so short, they give him ""growth pills"" making him think he's growing when taking them.  Since this movie was created by Police Academy producer PAUL MASLANSKY, you know it's gotta be a classic!  I hope that it will become a DVD RErelease because it is hilarious and deserves a resurrection!  Another thing that kinda steals the movie is the cute bull dog DUMPSTER cause whenever Murray would fall down, the dog would be there snorting, slobbering and spitting everywhere.  Anyway, I hope they make a DVD for it cause I wanna buy it.",1181174400,2,1458,4.467924528301887
1218727,1,B00000I1OX,"Of all the ski movies I've seen, this one is the weakest, with the exception of that Corey Haim/Ernest piece of garbage.  But, I think that goes without saying.
How can you have a ski movie that follows the typical ""fun loving guys versus uptight jerks with perfect hair"" blueprint of 80's ski films, and you don't even have hot girls and frontal nudity?  This is the main point of movies like this.  And how can you put a few million dollars into a film and only manage to squeeze about ten minutes of real humor out of it?  Somehow, the people who made Ski Patrol managed to do just that.  Even while somehow bagging some real thespian talent like the late great Ray Walston, and Martin Mull, they couldn't make it work.  This type of movie is damn near impossible to screw up, but it was, in fact, screwed up.
Neither Murray, nor the gags they played on him, were funny.  The black guy with the boom box doing Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson impersonations was terribly unfunny, and even George Lopez was not funny in this film.  The only time I even smirked was when the crazy mohawked punk guy was flying down the hill.  And the only two girls of note in this film, the hero's girlfriend and the foreign girl, were not even that cute and showed us NO skin whatsoever!  Again, that's the whole point of ski films.  Breasts!
The redeeming quality of this film?  Some good ski action.  But, you'll get a lot more of that out of a Warren Miller documentary and you won't have to sit through horrible writing and uninspired acting (did Mull and Walston owe somebody a favor?).  I know some people love this film and they're going to hate my review, but I've got to give my honest opinion.  Save your money if you're thinking of buying this.  Buy Hot Dog, buy Ski School, and skip this steaming pile that would make Pauly Shore cringe!",1050537600,4,1835,4.416666666666667
1218728,5,B00000I1OX,"This movie combines funny characters, ridiculous schemes and skiing stunts that will make you laugh time and time again.  I have seen this movie several times and the humor is so stupid I can't resist laughing.  The hoky  styles of the '80s are entertainment themselves.",954892800,10,270,4.955555555555556
1218729,5,B00000I1OX,this movie goes to the extreme when it comes to comedy. I liked all the characters in the movie. especially when the ski patrol got the best of Murry. If you love skiing and comedy this is the movie to see.,952214400,4,206,4.048780487804878

1218731,4,B00000I1OX,"Ski Patrol combines laughter, romance and tragedy on the slopes in a superb comedy.  The ski scenes are well shot and the puns are well timed in the movie.  The movie has great music and all the excitement of being on  the slopes.",940550400,,230,4.3023255813953485
