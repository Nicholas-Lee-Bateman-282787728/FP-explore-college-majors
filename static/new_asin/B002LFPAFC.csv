3946091,5,B002LFPAFC,"This is an absolute travesty of a film, but its so much fun to watch! The best scene in the movie (there are several but this is the best!) involves the girls lesbian gym teacher. She seduces the prettiest girl of the bunch (Lenka Novak)pulls her panties down and bathes her. Very hot as the gym teacher is definitely older. This movie also has chainsaws, vicious dogs, hillbillies, nude beauty contest and kristine Debell. Well worth your time if you've got a few hours to kill on a friday night.",1267228800,15,497,4.533333333333333
3946092,5,B002LFPAFC,"This is one of my all time favorites of this genre! I love the characters and the tongue in cheek presentation! Don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it! Gorgeous gals, interesting characters, fun story line! I waited a long time for this to arrive on DVD, and it was worth the wait. Excellent quality master! I bought the cheerleaders box set, and was disapointed that this wasn't included, because it was my favorite of the bunch! Oh and abundant gratuitous nudity that I must mention!

3946093,2,B002LFPAFC,"Poorly written, directed, and edited, with ridiculous mood shifts from zany, to ominous, then back to zany again.  On the plus side, the bus scene at the beginning is kind of fun, and a couple of lines and moments here and there are so ridiculous they're funny. Lots of cute topless girls, but the real reason to watch?  Kristine of course.  She's not topless in this, but she doesn't need to be.  She's one of the sweetest girls in the history of the movies, but never got the right role to be really big.  The good news?  We find out in the interview/commentary that she is back in Hollywood after having a family, and she is going to attempt to restart her career.  This is her first ever interview, and though her memory is fuzzy after all these years, she still reveals a lot of things about her life.  Anyone who's ever fallen for her charms will thoroughly enjoy this. She's 55 now and still cute.  2 stars for the movie, 5 for Kristine!",1263945600,14,944,4.379310344827586

8372780,5,B002LFPAFC,"Quintessential cheerleaders movie, in my opinion, because it's a time capsule between certain types of movies -- the tamer one, produced early in the seventies, and the campier and tamer ones produced in the eighties.  This came out in 1979, and hosts a great number of beautiful girls, including of course Kristine De Bell, Marilyn Joi, and others, including one foxy teacher (Leslie King?) who sure would have been an asset to other films.  Unlike most of these films, I watched the whole movie and enjoyed it, without fast forwarding, because frankly most of these movies have brain-dead plots as a matter of course.  Here the cheerleaders are sexy AND smart -- after being kidnapped they connive to initially overcome their situation, and then to cope with it in an entirely different manner.  The guys, who comprise most of the kidnappers gang, are pretty good actors too.  Essential purchase.  This DVD (Scorpion) presents a crisp, clean image in surprisingly great shape.",1405900800,,978,5.043478260869565
8372781,4,B002LFPAFC,"One of the later additions in the cheerleader sub-genre of films, this one works because it mixes hostage drama with nudity and violence. The pretty Kristine DeBell is one of the pretty cheerleaders whose bus gets hijacked and there's the usual sex and nudity that are usually found in these type of exploitation films. Scorpion Releasing found a great print for an anamorphic widescreen DVD release. I usually don't like films of this type, but it is well acted, the girls are pretty in and out of clothes and there's a sort of semi-revenge finale. If you like cheerleader films of the 70's, you'll like this one.",1400371200,2,614,4.747663551401869

8372783,4,B002LFPAFC,"Cheerleaders Wild Weekend aka The Great American Girl Robbery from 1979
is just another example of sexploitation from the decade of the '70's, but
with one exception, this one has Kristine DeBell who was in the October
1976 edition of Playboy magazine's baseball card themed pictorial
""Straighten Your Bats.""  While riding her Playboy exposure, so to
speak, she exposed more in the 1976 Alice In Wonderland: An X-Rated
Musical Fantasy, which is also worth your time, but back to the cheerleaders.
The bus-load of cheerleaders are kidnapped, but never in any real danger,
but they do end up having a wild time and to tell you more would spoil your
fun.  Like I said in my Hell Night review, the reason I got that movie was
because Linda Blair was in it and I got this one because Kristine DeBell
was in it.  It is fun and has plenty of flesh, but it is in no way a
horror film.  Fans of Kristine should have this in your film library.
1976 and 1977 were a bit of a slow start for her, but she took off in
1978 and worked mostly in TV up to 1986, then a break for some reason and
came back in 1990.  Then she really took a break of about 22 years and now
she is back once again.  Most of current work is rather tame, but still
a favorite of mine. I only wish her career path had been more along
the lines of Traci Lords, after she left porn, who did have some good
movies and some B type movies, but at least she stayed busy and in front
of the camera. If you are a fan of the '70's movies and want a
not too serious movie for a Saturday night, give this one a look, if you
can find it.  If Rooster-Spurs of Death ever makes it to DVD, grap that one as
well, as Kristine is in that one as well.",1364256000,5,1692,4.093655589123867
8372784,5,B002LFPAFC,"I have had this movie on VHS for over 20 years and got to see it upon it's release when I was a youngster (18) in a drive-in in 1980...The girls are beautiful, but all I hear from critics is about the blonde girl, Kristine Debell, I mean OK, she's pretty and all, but by far the sexiest & most attractive beauty in the film is the brunette, who at the beginning of the film is taking a shower topless, JANET BLYTHE, DAMN she's hot!!! Everyone I have had watch this film with me agrees and watch it for yourself and see...A lot of the evil plot by the bad men is taken out on sweet young Janet Blythe too, the African American man who makes sexual innuendo comments to her early on in the film, like ""I am Hungry...""...""Well I got something for you you..."" and stuff like that, and then later on in the film where she nearly gets raped by the African American fellow too...

Watch the film, true it's a terrible story to follow, but the beautiful young girls, all about my age at the time of it's release is reason enough to rate it so high...

Remember Kristine Debell is pretty and so are most of the others girls, including the Lesbian teacher, but by far, JANET BLYTHE is the true eye candy of this film...don't miss her 5 second shower scene in the opening credits...
I have paused that scene on my VHS so much it broke the tape, that's why I will now buy the DVD!!!",1283644800,4,1370,4.20532319391635
