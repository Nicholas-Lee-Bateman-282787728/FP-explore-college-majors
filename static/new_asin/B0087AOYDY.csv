8525975,4,B0087AOYDY,Nice combination of Stallone movies without having to get any of the truly awful ones.  Copland is very underrated.,1507766400,,115,5.052631578947368
8525976,2,B0087AOYDY,"I love the collection, but both copies I had shipped out sustained severe scratching on the first DVD in the case.",1474848000,,114,4.476190476190476
8525977,5,B0087AOYDY,"I picked this up at a Sobey's store for $10. It's listed for $8.99 from a 3rd seller on Amazon. If you like Stallone's films or love any one of these films, I highly recommend making the purchase.

All 3 films are good. There's no dud in this collection. My favourite is Lock Up but the others are just as good.

Upon watching the films, I felt they were inconsistent throughout in picture quality, meaning some scenes looked better than others. I don't have the DVD's to make a direct comparison, however I do have some other Stallone Blu-rays which look much better (ex. Cliffhanger).

For $10-12, I highly recommend this package of films.",1451433600,,641,4.605263157894737
8525978,5,B0087AOYDY,Excellent collection,1445299200,,20,9.5
8525979,5,B0087AOYDY,"I already have the 6 Disc DVD set for Rambo, but since that didn't have the author commentary this was a great way to get that feature without double dipping, since it has two other Stallone classics. There is 3 Disc, each disc are the same release as their solo Blu-Ray releases. You can't lose",1399420800,4,295,4.381818181818182
8525980,4,B0087AOYDY,"I had never seen Lock Up, and it was pretty crappy, but Rambo and Cop Land more than make up for it. They are all fine quality.",1375488000,,127,3.740740740740741
8525981,5,B0087AOYDY,I'm a big fan of Sly Stallone and this collection is a must have for all Stallone fans out there!,1372204800,2,97,3.9
