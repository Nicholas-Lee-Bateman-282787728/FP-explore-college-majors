30632,5,0780621956,"Wag the dog might not be a comedy for the masses. But anyone involved in communications, media or internet business should be entertained to the max by this movie.

While the scenario in the film is a  bit far-fetched in my opinion, it is delivered with top-notch performances  by an excellent cast. It is definitely an impetus to think about media's  message, in a McLuhan kind of way.  END",902880000,,481,4.9375

30645,4,0780621956,"SPOILERS: Scroll down if you want to read them. Or you can just take this paragraph for what it's worth. Wag the Dog is clever, fast-paced political comedy that suffers from being a bit too slick and a little on the nose, something that can be said about a lot of 1990s comedy. Still, it remains culturally relevant and worth watching. Practically mandatory if you follow politics today.

This is smart and funny. Almost a little too smart. And maybe a little less funny in light of everything that has transpired since the movie came out. It's also remarkably prescient. Consider that the premise is a scandal involving an incumbent President who commits criminal sexual conduct against a teenaged girl. In a beret. And there's a picture of him from the back, with her - in her beret - looking up at him.

Clearly a direct hit on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, right? Except the film came out first. Then the Lewinsky scandal, followed closely by several bombings (if I remember correctly). Pre-internet, the politics of media distraction were a bit harder to manipulate, but the film accurately predicts much of what we are enduring now: fake news, 24 hour news obsessions, and the death of truth as a political concept.

Highly recommend. Even if it isn't your thing, and it kind of isn't mine, it is a cultural touchstone.",1517011200,,1343,4.6344537815126055

The parallels to current political realities, when candidates can tell one lie in the morning and the opposite lie in the evening while their adherents blindly believe everything, is almost prophetic.  To reconsider our history from the time this movie was made in light of the tactics portrayed is mind boggling.  Watching the media moguls prey on emotions and while starving the intellect dramatizes our current political system.  Immensely entertaining and enlightening, I loved this movie now more than when it was made.  My favorite quote...""What did that television ever do to you?"" ""It destroyed the electoral process.""

30832,5,0780621956,"I just got done watching Wag The Dog, and it was very interesting. Apparently it is a satire based on a novel that proposed that ""President George Bush faked the Gulf War to bolster his mediocre presidency."" (All quotes from ""The Wag the Dog Story"" in the Special Features section of the DVD.)

I will have to read that novel.

""Author Larry Beinhart supports his fable with sources ranging from studies like TRIUMPH WITHOUT VICTORY to articles from The Nation. Beinhart's conclusion: the presentation of the Gulf War to the public were highly suspicious, the pageantry too great and so full of showmanship that it cast doubt on the event's actual occurrence.""

From what they say, the movie was released just as the Monica Lewinsky media storm became the news of its day, so people wondered if the movie producers had advance information. (No, they didn't, it was just uncanny timing.)

Did America ever create other wars? ""Publisher William Randolph Hearst created the Spanish-American War partly for public consumption."" (to sell newspapers). "" 'You supply the photographs, I'll supply the war,' he told his reporters.""

Apparently, even parts of World War One were staged. "" ... the U.S. government hired director D.W. Griffith to 'document' the war. ... Griffith staged and filmed several battle sequences that he brought back as newsreels to help the war effort.""

In ""The 90's: Truth, Justice and Special Effects"", we see that that Brean (the character in Wag the Dog), ""is relying on a disinterested public. He knows that if he can just entertain them, he can distract them fro the actual events. He knows they will never explore the realities because they rely on a press hell-bent on ratings and compromised by its entertainment values.""

The people who brought us Wag the Dog took ""the time to slow down the speeding information that flies at us from our televisions and shape it into something more meaningful.""

I highly recommend this file to you, and be sure to read the documentary information contained in the ""Special Features"" section.",1456185600,,2054,4.967930029154519

Like ""Network"" and ""Bob Roberts,"" ""Wag the Dog"" uses absurd humor to expose the fictions and propaganda that make up our media-constructed reality. The manipulation of public opinion and emotion and the manufacturing of crises are all too familiar in our post-9/11 world. The film makes knowing references to the Deep State. Robert De Niro's character belongs to some shadowy group that isn't even intimidated by the CIA, a group that can murder people and make it look like a heart attack.

I can only hope this is a simple oversight on the part of those who make these calls and that at some point the demand will justify the effort/expense required.

Sounds hokey? Well, yes. The movie refers to Reagan's military invasion of the island nation of Grenada shortly after a terrorist bomb killed hundreds of US troops stationed in Beirut, the claim being that Reagan was trying to distract the public from the troops being killed. Never mind that the Grenada invasion was real, and certainly did not distract the news media from the Beirut bombing. Also, even in the days when the Internet wasn't widely used, there's no way a completely fictional military action would not have been exposed shortly afterward.

But the movie does allow for that. They then use a convicted dangerous felon to play a soldier left behind in the supposed war, which would distract the public anew.

If you can believe that a completely fictional military action would be widely reported in the major news media and somebody not quickly reveal the hoax for what it is, this movie might be for you.",1424649600,3,1190,4.739130434782608

The election is in 11 days and these two outlandish fellows turn the entire political election process on its ear as they scheme and manipulate and produce images for the all to gullible American people.

The film has extremely witty dialogue and is fast paced, the acting is superb, but unfortunately the narrative is frightening. America invaded Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be political spin. I think such a film is actually educational just so that we get a picture of how public opinion can be manipulated. I loved it and found it to be very thought provoking.  I will grant that it depicted situations that were not very realistic, after all this was a comedy. I will also grant that the CIA, Department of Defense, and other federal agencies appeared to be lost and confused.

All those that convinced themselves in 2008 that Obama was going to change the world, see this movie and grow up.

It's very '1984', and I wouldn't be surprised if one day in the near future we are all told we are at war with Alabania. After all, you saw it on TV. I wonder what the script would have liked if they wrote this now in the age of facebook and twitsrus.com",1368921600,,682,4.3125

THE TAIL - WAGS THE DOG
--------------------------------------

Why does the dog wag its tail?
Because the dog is smarter than the tail.
If the tail were smarter, it would wag the dog.

I enjoyed this movie, it clearly shows how stories are designed when a distraction is needed.
Far too often news stories are needed to distract the public and this well written story shows
how this is done, step by step. Before elections, a spin-doctor and a Hollywood producer
join efforts to ""fabricate"" a war in order to cover-up a presidential mishap.

Story line main objective:
to distract the nation with something else as they try to get their boss out of the hot seat.

Interesting: In the funeral scene, soldiers in the military band
are played by members of the Riverside Community College marching band

The script is carried by an interesting concept, one that posits American politics is all spin with very little truth. Very good. So why am I giving this one star? Because the film posits you can manufacture a fake hollywood produced war unbeknownst to the American public which would be fine except for a few nagging and distracting OBVIOUS questions:

Wouldn't the Albanians know they are not involved in a war?

Wouldn't their neighboring questions know?

Wouldn't the press, foreign and domestic, head straight to the borders to try and cover the war and refugee problems?

Wouldn't the Albanian government be so flummoxed they would openly go to the press and UN with scratched heads and say its all good and well to be declared an enemy of the US but there is no small nor large war going on in Albania? That they aren't being bombed, gassed nor shot at? That the people are farming and starving as usual?

Wouldn't the European nations and its media also know there is no war on their continent?  I mean after all the US is a NATO member.

What about US troops and Generals? Even if the generals are willing to lie would the actual troops know none of them were being deployed to Albania? Even if it was a Delta or some other such elite agency?

Not only does this film charge the American public with general stupidity, which one could argue to be true, but it also believes those watching the film are also.

30982,5,0780621956,"I wish ""Wag the Dog"" were less funny. The idea that politicians used the media for self-serving purposes would be considered so outlandish that the movie would lose its punch.

But ""Wag the Dog"" is funny.

Great performances by DeNiro, whose smug political fixer combines just the right mix of reticence and brio. Kudos to Hoffman, whose narcissistic Hollywood producer - all colored glasses, scarves and wild ideas -- is over the top without sucking the air out of the movie. His catch-phrase when disaster strikes, ""This is nothing!"" is the running joke throughout the movie. Willy Nelson is terrific as a not-bright country singer who nonetheless pens the soundtrack for the war that DeNiro and Hoffman concoct. Great plotting too - seemingly insignificant offhand remarks bloom and morph into wild ideas. Setbacks (like the ill-timed and ignominious death of the ""hero"") are turned inside out and mutate into triumphs. And the media and public swallow it all.

FYI: the film shares almost nothing with the book its was based on: American Hero by Larry Beinhart. That book, which I am reading at the moment, casts the real president George HW Bush as staging a war to burnish his historical cred. WTD's president is trying to distract the public from a sexual scandal involving a young ""Firefly Girl."" Though they film's chief exec is always shown from the back, he bears some resemblance to Bill Clinton, who was the prez when then film came out in 1997. Sad/delicious irony that the film came out before the Lewinsky affair, yet shows the president in a rather familiar Rose Garden pose with the bereted young lass.

A funny film on its own merits, and a cautionary tale to boot.",1287446400,4,1684,4.857142857142857

The supporting cast,  including Woody Harrelson, do an incredible job, and the music by Dire Strait's Mark Knofler complements the on-screen action perfectly.

The President (partially shown, but apparently not resembling Clinton physically or politically) defiles a girl scout on a White House trip and it becomes public.

30992,5,0780621956,"One day before the biggest, most debatable political election in my lifetime, there was only one film that came to mind as to what needed to precede my arrival to the polls.  Sure, there are always cinematic greats like ""Nixon"" or ""JFK"", or even the subtle comedy ""Dave"", but my mind fell upon ""Wag the Dog"".  It had been nearly eight years since it last found its way into my DVD player, there was a level of concern of whether it would uphold.  Nearly eleven years old already, films of this nature are notorious for feeling dated, used, and even a bit clich.  Can a movie created in the late 90s still speak to a voting audience in the late 2000s?  Prior to ""Wag the Dog"" my answer would be ""no"", but watching, and now re-watching it for a second time in the past week, this film ... ""Wag the Dog"" ... could be watched today, watched next year, or even watched prior to the next four elections, and it would continue to feel current, real, and modern in today's political/cinematical world.  The power of the dialogue, the intense chemistry of the characters, and the constant interruption of the television generation into the political world will continue to keep ""Wag the Dog"" out of the black hole of cinema - it will not be dated, never forgotten, and forever enjoyed.  As we continue to allow CNN to give us our news, this film will remain as vivid as America's apple pie.

Act I: The Chemistry of the Characters

Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman could play chess for three hours, and it would capture my attention from beginning to end.  DeNiro is a powerhouse of an actor, not just because he can play the tough gangster type, but also because he can take a character like Brean and give us simple, verbose, and intelligent.  His range can be seen throughout this film.  He commands each scene that he is in, focusing our attention on each of his words and lingering on his next move.  In my eyes, it is more powerful than ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" because of his subtle nature.  The scene that stands out for me in ""Wag the Dog"" that requires viewing for DeNiro's talent is that between CIA Agent William H. Macy and DeNiro discussing the honesty of the war on Albania.  To me, this shows the power of his talent.

Jumping onto the other side of this film, there is Dustin Hoffman.  While DeNiro pulls his obvious strengths with this film, Hoffman makes ""Wag the Dog"" more than just a political film.  Listening to the commentary, Hoffman discusses the fact that he nearly didn't make this film because he couldn't find Motss's character.  Thankfully he did, due to his compelling portrayal; we are taken from political conspiracy cinema to this raw human drama.  The final act was sublime due to both DeNiro and Hoffman's chemistry, but also because we believed Motss' words.  As audience members, we wanted to see him tell his story (knowing that he never would).  It was the human element, the Motss' true self, that we were drawn to, and Hoffman stayed true to those moments until the very end.  This isn't your typical Hollywood happy film, this basis itself on - albeit conspiracies - but honest conspiracies.  Could you survive the greatest hoax ever and promise not to tell a soul?  Surrounding these characters, we had Willie Nelson, Denis Leary, Anne Heche, Kirsten Dunst, William H. Macy, John Michael Higgins, and - who could forget - Woody Harrelson.  These are our players, and they take us from scene to scene with the greatest of ease.

Act II: The Writing & the Directing

David Mamet.  Does anything else need to be said?  Having been a full time follower of his work, I was not surprised to see that it was his quick-witted words coming from our characters' mouths.  It is the fast-paced level of intellectual banter that transforms ""Wag the Dog"" into the powerhouse that it is.  It works because you finish watching the characters actions and it is the words you find yourself quoting for weeks after.  Mamet's political punch to this film was reminiscent of Kubrick's ideas behind ""Dr. Strangelove"".  The two were films that were absurd, but it was also the ideals that they were satirizing that makes both viewable today; just as powerful as they were when they were released.  Mamet's words with Barry Levinson's direction takes ""Wag the Dog"" into perfection.  There are no heroes, there are no villains, and we know so little about the characters that it is simply the story, or the words, that pull us into this film.  The beats are hit, the angles are crisp and tight, and our characters are perfection - possibly the best casting in years.  With this in mind, we have only the third act remaining - cause, as everyone knows - there is always a third act!

Act III: The Final Thought

Overall, ""Wag the Dog"" is perfect.  Very few films in my eyes fully carry the honor of being watchable at any time, any decade, or any political year - but ""Wag the Dog"" does.  Watching with a group of friends, I was surprised as to how many had not seen this feature, remembering that it had been birthed nearly 11 years ago, it still seemed surprising.  ""Wag the Dog"" overturns those political conspiracy theories and makes you laugh, think, and realize the impact of our commercial media.  It was enjoyable to hear the current terms like ""plumber"" and ""commercial president"" in this 1997 film, boasting the truth that this film was made before its time.  Looking back, there are those that could complain about our premise being too clich, that the same conspiracy theories have been done again and again, but to me, this was fresh.  This entire film was fast-paced, amazingly acted, and media driven.  In the commentary, it is talked about how it is rumored that the media doesn't even check sources any further, and this is a glowing example of that regime.

30994,5,0780621956,"""Wag the Dog"" should become an essential and enduring commentary about the influential role of broadcast media in modern life.  Though comedic on the surface, it has a dark undercurrent.  A U. S.

""Media Fixer"" Robert De Niro links up with film producer Dustin Hoffman to produce a military action against Albanian terrorists in order to divert news from the President.  The uproarious and rapid-fire development of the successful media plot is riveting.  However, in the end, after one stops laughing, a person ponders ""Shouldn't it be true?

30999,5,0780621956,"When one watches `Wag the Dog', especially now in this politically charged time in history, one can't help but wonder if this film was taken from classified documents lifted from the White House archives.  Did this really happen?  I have a feeling it did, and recently at that (and personally, I'm not talking about Clinton).  I couldn't help myself while watching this film to contemplate what was going through the minds of the actors and writers involved while they mulled over their source material.  It is true, very true, that the funniest things in life are based on personal experience.

With that in mind...

`Wag the Dog' is a film about government conspiracy, both authentic and artificial.  The president made a huge mistake just as he is up for reelection and it's up to his advisors to make that mistake disappear.  His rival candidate is using this `misstep' to his advantage by trying to persuade votes in his direction but Conrad Brean, a `spin-doctor', has a plan of his own, a plan that will turn the public's eye away from the presidents misconduct and onto his heroic good deeds.  Brean enlists the help of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to manufacture a war with Albania in order to draw attention to the president's strength in leading his country to victory.  Their plan is far from foolproof but Motss is a master of the lens and continues to stay one foot ahead of the apposing side.

Barry Levinson does a masterful job with this film.  The script is very tightly woven, brilliantly adapted from its source material to create one hilarious trip through the actions of the presidents men.  The acting is so superb it's almost unbelievable.  Dustin Hoffman has always been one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint as famed producer Motss.  He steals every scene he inhabits and brilliantly constructs Motss from the ground up.  Equally impressive is De Niro who soars as Brean.  His fast paced wit fits perfectly against that of Hoffman and they prove to be one fantastically structured comedic team.

The supporting cast also does a fine job at shining.  Anne Heche delivers, as does the likes of Willie Nelson, but its Denis Leary and Woody Harrelson that really make the most of their small roles.  Kirsten Dunst also does a fantastic job in her short scene, creating a lasting, very lasting impression.

As the opening words plastered across the screen allude to, this is a story about a dog that was dumber than its tail, a story about tail that was forced to wag the dog.",1199145600,,2516,4.751152073732719
31000,4,0780621956,This movie was released during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  It is about covering up political scandal by CREATING a larger incident.  Deniro is the president and Hoffman a hollywood director hired to solve the presidents problem. Very funny. Lots of INTERSTING characters.  Excellent OVER-THE-TOP performances by Deniro and Hoffman!  A must see at least once!,1189641600,2,361,5.62962962962963
31001,4,0780621956,"Yes the dog needs to be wagged severely by the tail. If politics is nothing but a branch of show business, it is nothing but tall tales and scary stories. In this film they fantasize the re-election of a President based on a Hollywood secret production of a story that sounds truer than reality. The President is going to be accused of some sexual misconduct - read my lips - twelve days before election day, so his advisers invent a war in Albania which is deflated by the CIA who do not like, for once, what is not true. Then they go on with the invention of a US prisoner of war left behind and finally freed and brought home, a Rip van Winkle of modern times. Poor Schumann. A rape-offender who is severely psychotic and who tries to rape the first woman he sees through a diner's window in the middle of nowhere. He ends up killed by the husband of the woman and he is brought back home, directly to Arlington. Superb. Unluckily the producer turns psychotic in his turn and wants the credit for the super production that re-elected the President. So he dies of a massive heart attack on his way to Hollywood, picked by some CIA agents, or is it FBI, and does it have any importance at all? They could have really done the same thing with the war on Iraq. It could and would have been a lot more palatable than it is right now. The film is greatly done though it has little depth and as a comic taste and bitter after taste. Of course it is all a story and it has no truth whatsoever, does it not?

31002,1,0780621956,"Clearly by the rating you have to be expecting some sort of negative positions on the film, and you'd be right.  Because in my opinion this film was trumped up to comedy gold, only to realize itself as nothing but a false laugh in the back of an empty theatre.  Yeah, I don't know what that sentence entirely means, but I do know that Wag the Dog lacked realism (except for the end, but assuming there's a chance you may actually watch this I figure I'll be nice enough not to spoil this.)

The plot centers around DeNiro, who is a political mind who is supposed to help control public opinion in the face of a presumably soon-to-be leaked sex scandal.  To spin his magic DeNiro teams up with a Hollywood producer, played by Dustin Hoffman, who plans on making this cover-up the masterpiece of his career.

Well, that's the story.  So now you know the basic beginning to what I believe is far from a masterpiece, as Wag the Dog lands much closer to a master flop.",1170806400,4,963,4.382022471910112
31003,5,0780621956,"When this movie came out, Monica Lewinski's 15 minutes of fame (or infamy) had not started ticking, though people thought it was realistic especially with Clinton in the White House.  A year later, Clinton was bombing Iraq, which coincidentally coincided with when the impeachment hearings took place (starting the day the hearings were to begin, though they were postponed a day, and ending right after the hearings ended, being termed a success).

The makers of the movie for some reason thought this movie needed an R rating and used the ""f"" word more than necessary (though I feel it being used once is much more than necessary).  Aside from that, the movie was funny (e.g. a girl running with Doritos), with cynicism concerning the reporting of news.  By the way, this movie was not a direct attack on Clinton but rather looking at the way politicians work.

Dustin Hoffman earned his best actor nomination.  Robert DeNiro deserved one as well.",1170115200,3,949,4.9
31004,5,0780621956,"""Wag the Dog"" is one of the best political satires ever made. In fact, it might be one of the best satires ever made about anything. The film is co-written by David Mamet ('Edmond'), directed by Barry Levinson (who, in 2006, directed another political comedy ""Man of the Year""), and stars two two-time Oscar winning actors. The movie stars Robert De Niro as Conrad Brean, the Mr. Fix It of the White House. After the President (whom we never see) is accused of sexual misconduct with a teenage girl, 11 days before the election, Brean is hired to create something that will take the focus away from that. With his assistant Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) in tow, Brean hires Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to stage and execute a fraudulent war. Motts gets to work, staging a war in Albania and hiring a young girl named Tracy Lime (a young Kirsten Dunst) to portray an Albanian girl running away from terrorists. One of the funniest scenes in the film occurs while filming the fake war.

Tracy: ...I get to put this on my resume, right?

Brean: Actually, no. You can never tell anyone you did this.

Tracy: What could they do to me?

Brean: They'd come to your house and kill you.

As the media eats up the war, taking the attention away from the sex scandal, they find themselves in need of another made-up story. So, they come up with a war hero who is still stranded ""behind enemy lines in Albania."" When they become ready to unveil him to the nation, they find themselves in even more trouble. Turns out the war hero, William Schumann (Woody Harrelson) is unlike any war hero you've ever seen. ""Wag the Dog"" is filled with scathing wit and is masterfully directed by Levinson. It's Hoffman and De Niro that really make this film as good as it is. They play so well off of each other that they both eat up the scenery. The movie features a whole jubilee of other stars including Denis Leary, Willie Nelson, and William H. Macy to name a few. The film was made during the Clinton administration and there's a lot of parallels with that, but the movie is still relevant today. It was one of the highest praised films the year it was released, but few people see it now. Hopefully anyone who does stumble upon it will give it a chance; it's truly a terrific and very funny movie.

31009,4,0780621956,"After viewing Wag the Dog I can say that I did in fact enjoy watching it, but I'm not wholly sure why. Well lets start with a few problems I had with it to give my head a chance to think it over one more time. My main beef with this film is that at some times the plot drags along a little too slow, without hardly anything happening, or much keeping you distracted until a plot twist came into effect. I also have to say that I thought their choice for background music quite odd for what the movie was based on; the music used although hardly used, makes the whole thing seem light-hearted or like a fairly tale which for this movie is bad because the whole idea of it is to make he viewer question what the media tells you. And music like that just makes it a little harder to believe.

Anyway, I really liked the idea of not even including the president as a character in the movie. He was just heard from the other end of the phone saying dumb things like ""That cat should defiantly be white."" or ""It sounds too corny."" That adds to the main reason I enjoyed this movie; Its unconventional yet still effective. It doesn't really fit into one given genre, so I have to slap the broad Drama/Comedy label onto it. Which makes it difficult to compare to other movies of the aforementioned genres. What I mean by that is that I couldn't recommend this to a fan of Comedy or drama, because it ends up being a mix of both, so if you a genre buff you probably won't enjoy wag the dog. But people with an open mind will, however, be able to see past the need of having a genre plastered on everything and enjoy this movie for what it is.

The acting is as expected from just a star-studded cast that includes such big names as Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman,
Dennis Leary and Willie Nelson. I don't know how much better you could expect the acting in a movie to be. Of course its really Hoffman and Di Niro who shine in this movie; they work well off each other making you  forget who they are in real life and think of them as Stanley Motss and Conrad Brean.

All in all I would recommend Wag the dog to anyone who enjoys movies, Comedies, Satires, and/or people who just enjoy a new idea or plot. Take it from Someone who has only ever really enjoyed a handful of movies in their life; you should see this movie.",1143417600,2,2310,4.195945945945946

I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs.

31012,5,0780621956,"""Wag the Dog"" is a scathing parody of how politicians manipulate the media to mold public opinion and sentiment. Briefly, the President (think: Clinton)is accused of molesting a ""Firefly"" girl (think: Monica) and his main ""behind the scenes"" political operative (think:Karl Rove) hires a Hollywood producer to create a war with Albania to distract the public. It's hard to believe that this film was made in 1997, before the Clinton impeachment, and even harder to believe that the film was made long before the Iraq war. Remember the famous ""hostilities are over"" media event when Bush landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier? When was that? Three years ago?

It's hard to beat this star-studded cast: deNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson, Kirsten Dunst (in a bit role), and a hysterically funny Willie Nelson. This is a film that has gotten even more relevant and pointed since its release--a rare thing.

31022,3,0780621956,"Nominated for two Academy Awards, including one for its screenplay, Wag The Dog turned out to be one of the more interesting films of the 1990s. When the President of the United States faces accusations that threaten to destroy his reelection chances, several of his advisors work with a Hollywood director to concoct a fake war in Albania to serve as a distraction. Released several months before the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, Wag The Dog foreshadowed events to come as some believe hostilities with Iraq were used to draw attention away from the impeachment proceedings. But regardless of what occurred in real life, Wag The Dog paints a hilarious and clever picture of the endless manipulations political handlers attempt to pull off in the real world. Hopefully, they're never on such a grand scale...

With the president (Michael Belson) embroiled in a breaking sex scandal, two of his top aides - Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) and Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) - immediately move into damage control mode. Election Day is too close to wait for the scandal to simply pass over and become old news, so Brean comes up with a plan.

Visiting noted Hollywood director Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman), Brean pitches an absurd proposal. He wants Motss to create a war for him. In one of the more memorable scenes from the film, Brean and Motss are watching a White House press conference, and at Motss' request, Brean calls the White House and tells the White House Press Secretary word-for-word what to say to the press. The detailed manipulation is only a sign of things to come. Making the decision to create tension between the United States and Albania, the two men conjure up more than just an international crisis.

Along with singer Johnny Dean (Willie Nelson), they create songs to commemorate the non-existent victims and war heroes. They even manufacture a fraudulent war hero, Sergeant William Schumann (Woody Harrelson) - whose sacrifice is acknowledged by throwing shoes into trees and onto power lines. But will Brean and Motss succeed in their deception? Can political aides really conspire to concoct lies big enough to change an election...

Dustin Hoffman received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Hollywood director Stanley Motss. Hoffman plays the part to perfection, combining bits of humor and eccentricity to create a memorable character. De Niro (who later stars with Hoffman in Meet The Fockers), despite being overshadowed by Hoffman's Oscar nomination, puts in a strong performance as well. It's not quite The Godfather II, but it's a lot better than Analyze This. In addition, Wag The Dog is one of the few films where I believe Anne Heche makes a mark for herself as a serious actress and not just the former companion of Ellen DeGeneres. Overall, the acting and direction for this movie are more than enough to make Stanley Motss proud...

Wag The Dog raises some arguable questions of the true freedom of the American citizenry. America may have freedom of the press, but how do we know what new is true and what news is not? Wag The Dog makes for great satire in respect to a free republic's own vulnerability to propaganda. If the Clinton impeachment proceedings had not been so close to the release of this film, it might well have dropped off the radar. But the Clinton scandal and all the questions surrounding it only served to make Wag The Dog a part of history and a part of the day's political vernacular, and that's why it's a definite must-see film...

The movie is primarily a political satire, and contains many truths, not to mention a strong sense of FAMILIARITY...

Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Kirsten Dunst, Anne Heche, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all WONDERFUL!

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

31024,3,0780621956,"Wag The Dog is a brilliant political satire that is more relevant today than ever before. The film is based aroudn the precept of a president who is up for reelection and suddenly hit by (would ya believe it) a sex scandal in the oval office. In an effort to draw public attention away from the sex scandal it is decided to ""fake"" a war with Albania. Take into account this movie was made BEFORE the monica lewinsky drama - in fact it was released just a few weeks before the whole clinton sex scandal broke. Prophetic?

The movie actually had nothing to do with clinton. it was based on a book, which argued that the gulf war never really happened and was filmed and produced by hollywood producers hired by the first Bush administration to boost an otherwise failing presidency. However Wag The Dog doesnt focus on any specific president, but more on the concept of a precidency faking a war and manipulating public perception.

The issues brought up by Wag The Dog invite a welcome debate in america. It Criticizes the heavy use of spin doctors in political campagnes and how the president in our times is a ""product"" that we are ""sold"". It raises questions as to where the limits of this power to decieve the public could end and prompts one to contemplate the relationships between the public, the media, and the goverment. The fact is the media now-a-days cares more about ratings than truth and feels more like entertainment than information. The impact of sound bytes and headlines and those pictures and stories that capture the public mind  on our democracy cannot be underestimated.

The problem? The problem is that while Wag The Dog is a great topic of discussion for after you watch it, and is VERY politically relevant... it just isn't a very good movie. It's not very funny for a comedy, and is many times disengaging and unbelievable in thier specific story-line. Robert Dinero and the rest of the cast deliver good performances but to a fairly bland script. This movie definatley looks a lot better on paper than on screen.

The bottom line is that Wag The Dog makes an excellent movie to watch in a classroom to instigate a thoughtful debate about politics and the media. Wag The Dog is probably a movie every american should force themselves to sit through at least once and then really think about. And Wag The Dog is a movie that trancends hollywood to an extent that the term ""wag the dog"" is a commonly known term now in politics and in the media (IE 'you think the president is pulling a wag the dog?). It is and SHOULD REMAIN a heavily discussed film. However, all in all, the movie in and of itself offers little to the audience and is not likely to be enjoyed or remembered by many by anything EXCEPT it's underlying theme.",1105488000,3,2751,4.583333333333333
31025,5,0780621956,"There's no question as to whether this film is plausible or not. All of the technology needed to execute everything it depicts is in place and has been for some time. Physically, all of what it suggests could happen. It could be happening. The only real question is whether the ethics of the political and media machines are above doing it or not.

This film takes that question and suggests what its answer might be. What comes out is a scathing commentary presented as the blackest of comedies. And it is very, very black. It succeeds though because it's strong on all fronts. The script, written by David Mamet and Hilary Henkin, is excellent. It's alive with wit. There are plenty of great opportunities for anyone with good timing, comic or dramatic, to make full use of them.

Director Barry Levinson took full advantage of that. His sense of pacing is exceptional. The film never becomes bogged down. When the pace does slow for an instant now and then it serves as an opportunity for the viewer to absorb what they've seen. His sense of timing is excellent because the gags, though they're expected, always seem to come from nowhere. The editing, done by Stu Linder, is superb. If Levinson's timing was off anywhere Linder's editing corrected it.

There really isn't a weak performance in this film but a few are so strong they have to be singled out. Woody Harrelson is in excellent form as the maniac-made-hero, ""Old Shoe"". Anne Heche gives a tour de force as the White House Press Agent who suddenly discovers the ""other side"" of her job. Robert De Niro is entirely convincing as the conniving manipulative spin master whose sole purpose is to see that only the ""right"" news items stay in the spotlight. The film belongs to Dustin Hoffman though. Next to his role in the Rain Man this is one of the best things I've seen him do. His ability to get right inside a character is still astonishing. His character, the vain and eccentric producer who pulls jewels from sewage, is the most likeable character in the film. That point serves to drive the grimmer side of the message this film is giving home.

Wag the Dog is a film that addresses what has to be a touchy subject for a lot of people. It probably won't please a really large audience because of that. I don't know. I have no idea as to how well (or poorly) the film did at the box office. It's a film that should be seen though. The comment it makes isn't so much as to whether the political establishment is morally bankrupt or not but rather about how easily it would be for it to manipulate (or manufacture) facts if it is. It does it in a way that's consistently funny and it never loses sight of the point it's trying to make.

There are some excellent notes provided in the ""special features"" section of the DVD. They provide a bit of history as to how Hollywood has been used as a ""spin machine"" to manipulate propoganda on behalf of what government wanted. Anyone taking the time to watch this film should read them. They provide plenty of incentive to view this film in a serious light.",1102377600,2,3063,4.531645569620253

He's up for re-election and the story is about to break.  How do you get people's minds off of it?  You create a bigger story.  So comes the idea to stage a make believe war in Albania.  Why Albania?  Because no one knows anything about Albania, that's why.

How do you make it look like we're at war?  You hire a Hollywood producer and swear him to silence of course!  It sounds ridiculous for sure but it's just far fetched enough to work here and given some of the things that go on in the oval office these days, is it any wonder that Hollywood loves to take pot shots at Washington?

Conrad Breen (Deniro) is Mr. Fix it.  He's the guy you call when you need to get out of a jam.  Dustin Hoffman plays the Hollywood producer.  The real story here is that there are spin doctors that try to make us believe the opposite of what has happened.  How much of it do they get away with?  How much of it do we believe?

This is the question the movie 'Wag the Dog' (1997) is about. The director of the movie is Barry Levinson The movie with Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro playing the main players, is about a presidential election controlled by the media.

At the beginning of the movie the presidant has a sexual affair with a 15-year-old-girl and because there are only some days left to the presidential election, the president instructs Mr. Fix-It (Robert De Niro), a man who works for the president to do something against that. So he goes to a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) and tells him that he has to create an artificial war against Albania, by creating short video clips published on TV of a war againt Albania, to bring the sexual affair in the background.

This movie is a great movie in my opinion because it shows how politics can use the media to controll the public. Can we trust everything shown on TV or written in the newspaper ? Definitely not because there are always people who want to use something for their own advantage (for example money,peoples' agreements or even an election). So who can we believe ? The movie shows that everything can be a lie because even the president can use the media for his own advantage. I think the movie makes a lot of people think about the media. Maybe after seeing this movie the people think more about that what they see and do not believe everything anymore. Maybe they prove and difference things. And because of that I like this movie. It had a positive affect on me. You really have to see it.

31050,4,0780621956,"This satire directed by Barry Levinson (And Justice For All) rather than becoming 'dated' gets more delicious and enlightening with age.
The title 'Wag The Dog', originally referred to the need for reality to fashion itself to conform to the power of television.  In order to play to the people, the facts had to be styled to meet the method of distribution.
The film now offers a much greater lesson and a warning to the population of the great lengths to which politicians and the government might go to deceive the American people and/or fabricate 'truth' to suit their own end.
The commentary, although only five years old, has become the most 'dated' feature on the DVD.
The multiple occurrences of: the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, the terrorists and 09/11/2001, colored ribbons, 'spontaneous' waves of patriotism, and the recent war in Iraq (particularly the revelation of the true facts surrounding the rescue of Jessica Lynch) have made 'Wag The Dog' more cutting edge with the advent of each individual incident.
Today's viewers must continually and repeatedly jolt themselves back to reality with reminders that they are NOT viewing an  educational documentary on 'spin' or a how-to-film outlining  methods for fabricating and implementing diversion, but are instead viewing an entertaining and satirical film developed well before the occurrence of any of the events listed above.
This is a film where David Mamet, well known for his realistic dialogue, had the character's speaking the future in a most frightening way.
'Wag The Dog' is great viewing for new and repeat viewers alike.  It is a reminder of how we the public can be misled by what we see and hear in the press and on television.  The film itself is however not misleading, but thought-provoking, and as it chillingly turns out, perhaps even more realistic than we knew in 1997.",1054339200,13,1879,5.048387096774194

Sure, it is likely too unwieldy to stage a phony war from start to finish with all the accompanying public manipulations, but there is no doubt that presidents and their handlers use war and the threat of conflict as sleights of hand to distract citizens from uncomfortable matters. If you think this is far-fetched, you're either not paying critical attention to current events or you've more or less bought into the messages that arrive generally unfiltered from the top through our mainstream media outlets. Wag the Dog is a movie, a fantasy, but it rings true enough when you consider how willing journalists and their bosses are to take as articles of faith what is handed to them from the press offices of the White House, the RNC, and the DNC.

I find it truly amazing that whenever Hollywood paints an accurate picture of our political climate, or tries to alert us to our own ignorance, we just don't seem to get it, no matter how many times they try hitting us over the head with the obvious. It becomes evident that ''anti-Red'' scaremonger Joseph McCarthy really didn't need to do much of anything -- he could have just sat back and sipped on his martini, because, in the end, the American public doesn't take political messages in Hollywood movies seriously anyway. Case in point: ''Wag The Dog.''
In a blatant attempt prove to his audience that any kind of media spin desired can be created and executed to benefit any and every political agenda imaginable (as though trying to prepare us ahead of time for the real possibility of an illegal overthrow of ""representative democracy"" in America, such as occured with the installation of President 'Un-Elect' George Walker Bush), David Mamet shows `We, the People' just how gullible and how easily manipulated we are by ""official looking"" and ""official sounding"" media presentations, ESPECIALLY when ""patriotic"" themes are involved.
Just like G.W. Bush and his associate Republican thugs cooked up a non-existent ""War On Terror"" to keep the public's mind off of the President's misdeeds and political ineptness, so too do the advisors and insiders of Mamet's fictitious administration of an unnamed President cook up a non-existent ""War"" against a ""terrorist nation"" (arbitrarily, Albania -- an insignificant dirt-poor country, just like Afghanistan) in order to keep the public's mind off of the President's alleged misconduct with a ""Firefly Girl"" (a thinly veiled parallel reference to the sexual misconduct of the last duly elected President in the nation, William Jefferson Clinton).
The timing could not have possibly been worse for a scandal to erupt around Mamet's ""President,"" since it is during a point in the presidency where the Commander in Chief is actively seeking re-election. So a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) has been called in to brainwash and mislead the public with a number of staged manipulative media events all wrapped neatly in the banner of patriotic jingoism. As one of the President's advisers, played by Robert DeNiro, states: ""It's a pageant!""
Mamet shows us how easily we can get swept up in jingoism to such an extent that we forget to ask the truly important questions and just sit back on our big fat collectives and 'let someone else do the hard thinking for us.' It's how dictatorships are born -- and to quote the words of George W. Bush VERBATIM, as spoken on December 18, 2000, just less than a week after he was ""appointed"" President by the Supreme Court:
''If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier... just so long as I'm the dictator.''",1023062400,3,2815,4.978768577494692
31056,5,0780621956,"A lot of people knocked this film for being a rip-off of current events.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  What makes this satire so amazing is that its all coming true.  For example:
1)  This movie was made BEFORE the lewinsky/clinton scandal but the details were frighteningly similar
2)  It told us the war of the future would be against dissident terrorists plotting against the US from camps in some remote country...years before we had heard of al Qaeda, 9/11, or a war in afghanistan
3)  Watching Willie Nelson leading the 9/11 Tribute to Heroes telethon in singing ""God Bless America"" seemed like it was a rip-off of this movie.
To many, the premise of this movie may have seemed absurd when it was released.  But each passing year reveals how closer it is to the truth than we think.  For a scary, thought-provoking satire of Hollywood and Washington, check this movie out.
If it was a 2002 film, people would say it was a clever satire.  That it was made in 1997 qualifies it as an absolute classic.",1022716800,67,1018,4.580110497237569
31057,4,0780621956,"Really good satire should be both funny and destructive, like Voltaire or Swift or Mark Twain at his darkest. Wag the Dog scores on both counts.
The film is on traget in its depiction of Americans as sentimental and gullible dupes who will fall for flag-waving flim-flam and who can be gulled by media hype. The President, a week or so away from re-election, is caught dallying with a 12 year old Firefly Girl in the Oval Office and seems doomed. Enter Robert di Niro as a master crisis manager. He enlists an egomaniacal Hollywood producer (smarmily played by Dustin Hoffman) and an an anxiety-ridden Presidential aide (Ann Heche) in a plot to concoct a phony war with Albania that will draw attention from the scandal.
The superb set pieces include the filming of a war-torn orphan girl (Kirsten Dunst in a cameo) fleeing a burning village--all done in a studio, with special effects. The sequence makes you wonder about so many other exclusive bits of news film and also shows the cynicism and manipulation of the media. My very favorite bit involves the writing of a stirring patriotic song by a gin-soaked country star (Willy Nelson). He comes up with some delicious claptrap about guarding the Canadian border (against invading Albanians!!) and then records it with a huge chorus replete with heart-rending solos. The result is a dead-on, riotous send-up of Michael Jackson's ""We Are the World."" There's also a terrific scene where Di Niro's character cons a straight-arrow CIA agent (William Macy) out of turning him in.
When the CIA announces that there is no Albanian threat, the scam artists switch gears and concoct a ""war hero"" missing behind enemy lines. They pick a soldier named Shoemaker and begin a fad by tossing old shoes over telephone wires (soon everyone is doing this--a glorious attack on the idiotic festooning of yellow ribbons whenever an American is missing somewhere). When they attempt to bring ""Old Shoe"" (Woody Harrelson) back for a hero's welcome, he turns out to be a psychotic rapist. A plane crash and an infuriated father's shotgun blast later, Old Shoe is dead, and Di Niro and company stage a funeral with a stirring Green Beret type song and a grieving dog. When Hoffman's character refuses to hush up his brilliant producing job, he meets a dark fate.
The writing is savage and all too true, and the acting is excellent. I held back a star for the pacing, which seems to me all wrong. A satire like this should crackle and move at a breakneck pace (like Kubrick's Doctor Strangelove), but the film ambles in a style that seems right for a sentimental drama.

31062,4,0780621956,"Despite the appearance that it has the typical ""Lewinsky"" plot, Wag the Dog is a masterfully scripted satire that concerns more than tainted politics. The movie opens with the seemingly pointless and unanswerable question, ""Why does the dog wag its tail?"" But it interestingly continues, ""Because it's smarter... otherwise the tail would wag the dog.""  And that's what it's all about: control and intelligence.
Wag the Dog finds the president in a dire situation a mere two weeks before Election Day. Allegations that the president groped a Firefly girl on a Whitehouse tour are sure to hand the election over to Sen. John Neal. Conrad Brean (DeNiro), A political ""Mr. Fix-It,"" is promptly brought into the picture, and he decides to distract the media with a fictitious war in Albania. He and Winifred Ames (Heche), the presidential advisor, delegate the fabrication of the war to a famous but eccentric and self-pitying producer, Stanley Motts (Hoffman). As they use all types of propaganda including film, music, and catchy slogans, the trio tumbles further into the abyss of corruption, continuing with more propaganda, but the public buys it.
Wag the Dog boasts a first-class cast. DeNiro shines in his role; he is sometimes so great at his job of hiding the truth that even his co-workers are unclear about what's real. Hoffman surprisingly deviates from his usual sober, intense roles. His amazing talent gives life to his egotistical attitude and his constant declarations of power as producer.
The movie's witty screenplay is especially potent in its ability of making jabs at the government. Brean says, ""We haven't declared war since WWII. We're going to war.""
While it is amusing that the movie makes trivial items like shoes become symbolic of patriotism, the disturbing thing about Wag the Dog is that it hits dangerously close to home. The fact that the media can falsify footage that moves the country to tears shows its power over public sentiment. Truthfully, how smart is the American public? It also arouses suspicion because the movie preceded the actual bombing in Albania, which seemed similarly planned to deter attention focused on the Lewinsky scandal.",974419200,9,2178,5.117977528089888
31063,3,0780621956,"Wag the Dog: rated R, 1 hour and 40 minutes
 A group of spin-doctors plan to create a diversion to turn the Americans' attention away from a scandal aimed at the president just weeks before the election. Robert De Niro plays Conrad Brean, the intelligence of this group of con artists, who produces the illusion, along with the help of an assistant (Anne Heche), and a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman). Brean thinks of the ideas and Motss (Hoffman) puts them into action. Together they succeed in fooling America and rigging the elections.  This movie has no doubt a very clever plot, with many smart, comical points, but it also lacks the image that makes a movie what it is. The characters are exceedingly shallow, and in general, it seems that all the trouble gone through to fake a war can be made easier if instead the efforts were put into helping the president make a new campaign slogan, which is repeatedly made fun of throughout the film. Overall, the ideas are acceptable, yet the execution appears to have failed.  Though the movie seems full of humor and canny remarks, the actual message expressed in Wag The Dog is rather disturbing. This poses the question: If America can be deceived so easily at something as difficult to conduct as a war, how would America react to a small scam made up? The film proves how easily the news can be manipulated and controlled. In this movie there is no distinguishing borderline between fact and fiction. The idea that anything seen or heard on the news might be a hoax, the comical punch line of this movie, may not be so funny after all.

(I haven't shown it to our kids because the language is offensive.)  This is not the place to explain the politics of life to Clinton's defenders, but the spin-doctoring by the administration (aided by media shills riding shotgun) to divert the public's attention from the festering corruption (exemplified by frying people with cruise missiles from Sudan to Afghanistan to Serbia -- remember operation ""Desert Firefly/Fox""?) serves as a warning that tyranny usually creeps up on a docile public by stealth, deceit and bribery.  Willy Nelson's patriotic war-song sent shivers up my spine because it reminded me how gullible the electorate can be in blindly rallying around demagogues merely because enough voters were bamboozled.  WTD is insightfully  portrayed satire, because unlike most of the tendentious propaganda (e.g., ""The American President"") rolling out of  Hollywood, it actually illuminates the dark side's manipulation of ""information"" as performed by the left.

Because wars are so trivalized in the American conciousness it would  be quite easy to fool the public in to believing whatever they are told.  But there is also another level to this film and it is not a satire at all.  Wag the Dog is also a film about film. It shows just how powerful the  medium of motion pictures can be.

By the way,  unlike so many films, the pacing doesn't break once - it moves fast, though  not too fast, and you'll find that you never once look at your watch.",953424000,,737,4.321167883211679
31072,5,0780621956,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wag the Dog"" when it premiered amidst the beginnings of the Lewinsky scandal. The movie had the uncanny good fortune to pop up at the right time. As a political junkie I was amazed that  Hollywood had put together such a witty parody of politics- a spoof of all  of the spinning and message making that goes on in politics.
The  performances are right on the money- Dustin Hoffman was great as a  neurotic, ego-driven Producer, and far from the flamboyant James Carville  type, Robert DeNiro's confident spinmaster is closer to what political  operatives are really like. The plot Hoffman and DeNiro cook up to distract  the people from the President's sexual escapades- a war with Albania,  complete with bombed villages created on a Hollywood soundstage -is even  quasi-believable.
As the year wore on I appreciated the movie even more:  the theme of ""Wag the Dog"" is how easily people buy into what  they are told without questioning (how can we have a democracy when people  don't ask questions). I was more than a little disgusted to watch people  react to the U.S. bombing terrorist camps in Afghanistan amidst the Clinton  impeachment scandal with the response: ""This is just like 'Wag the  Dog'!"" In effect, they had grasped the exact OPPOSITE of the movie's  theme. Hollywood had fed them a scenario and they embraced it without a  second thought.
Great movie. Cuts close to home.",949449600,,1411,4.861344537815126
31073,4,0780621956,"This is a very funny satire which was criminally overlooked on its initial release in cinemas. Actually, upon watching it, it might perhaps be the subversive nature of the script which could explain its failure in America,  because it damns politics and the media within that country, and never  panders to the audience, delivering the ending it ultimately deserves. Of  course, Mamet is a first-class writer, and beyond all the clever barbed  swipes and witty asides, this is very funny story-telling which rather  perversely does make you feel happy afterwards, if only because it at least  shows that not all writers these days have to resort to jokes centred  around bodily parts. the commentary from Hoffman and Levinson is  informative but not very captivating (hear the worst De Niro impression  ever from Hoffman), and the essays and other such notes are extensive but  quite dull. The trailer also rather stupidly summarises the entire film in  a couple of minutes, so leave that until after the film, but the moving  menus are nice with some great guitar music from Mark Knopfler acompanying  them (he did the score for the film too). All in all, a worthy yet bland  package for a great film whose title is cleverer than a lot of movies'  entire scripts.",949017600,,1264,4.868544600938967
31074,4,0780621956,Wag the Dog was a great movie. It shows how the american people are so easily manipulated by propaganda. People who don't think this is possible then they bought what the goverment is selling which is ignorance. Not my  americans are aware how much they goverment knows and does. The goverment  as been covering things up for years. This movie shows how easily issues  can be covered up. Hoffman and De Nero are great as they usaully are. The  only thing is the songs are kinda cheesey which I guess fit in alright. A  must watch.,948585600,,530,4.479166666666667
31075,5,0780621956,"Wag the Dog is an extremely clever satirical look at the manipulation of the media in contemporary times.  Those reviews which suggest it is a film  which is brainless and far-fetched need look no further than Bosnia and the  bombings in Africa during the Monica Lewinsky saga to see that in fact,  life imitates art.
Another aspect which was touched upon in Mamet's  brilliant screenplay was the subtext of the film producer's (Hoffman) role  (the role of ego). Within a film production ego and credit might be  standard practice, but transposing these values onto a highly classified,  sensitive goverment ""production"" is impossible - perfectly  counterpointed by Robert De Niro's character.
This is definitely a film  for lovers of ironic and cerebral humour - those with a literal sense of  humour need not bother...",947548800,5,820,5.090225563909774
31076,4,0780621956,"Wag the Dog was a thrill ride from beginning to end, as well as being gut-busting funny  A film of extremley high quality. It shows how the media is beholden to ""official sorurces"" for its information, and how  the ""official sources"" could very well be feeding the media  fantastic falsehoods that the media reports as the ""honest  scoop"". I have no doubt that this is an accurate portryal of how those  who depend on the news media are manipulated into believing things that are  not true. A first class production that will be a grand source of  entertament to anyone ever involved with film or theatre. It was Dustin  Hoffman's greatest performance ever, and the Fad King is one of the most  magnificent characters ever brought to the screen. Rober DiNero was superb,  as well as being totally believable.. The only reason I don't give it five  stars is because, as always,  the bad language was not necessary. It could  have been a fabulous film without it, despite the vapid arguments for  ""realism"".",941932800,,1005,4.734104046242774
31077,1,0780621956,"I've been disappointed by movies before.  At times I've felt as though I wasted my two hours and money.  But rarely do I feel absolutely disgusted and depressed from a film.  This counts as one of those times.  There's  no hero in this movie.  Not one person whose actions seem admirable, or at  least neutral.  These characters are simply out to betray the populace and  the office of the Presidency for the sake of one mans' campaign.  Primary Colors had a similar theme, but it succeeded where Wag the Dog  failed.  It presented a full view of the President in question, and that  man had some strong redeeming qualities.  Also, Primary Colors had it's  fair share of characters who were appalled at the President's behavior.  In  Wag the Dog, no main character seems to have the slightest dought about  their campaign of deceit.  Meanwhile, they're easily able to invent a war  and pull the wool over the public's eyes.  I understand that, as a comedy,  the audience isn't expected to accept the characters as role models.  Nevertheless, I was unable to suspend disbelief in the plot, and I was left  feeling hollow inside from the lack of any character to identify with.",929923200,4,1175,4.702970297029703
