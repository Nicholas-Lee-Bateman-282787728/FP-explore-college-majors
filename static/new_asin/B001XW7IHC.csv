The concept here is great, but I feel rushed to the point of sacrificing proper form because Joyce moves from lifting weights to lying down for ab work so quickly and repeatedly.  In her Speedy Non Stop video,  you can  do the abdominal work separately.",1457481600,,316,4.6909090909090905
8347879,5,B001XW7IHC,"Have always loved Joyce; and this is one of my favorite workouts (and Cougar Workout).  She does make really fast transitions in this video, so sometimes I struggle a bit to be in 'the right place at the right time"" if it's been a long, tiring day... Ultimately, she is my 'go to'. Her humor and strength is really motivating!",1455926400,,326,4.433333333333334
8347880,5,B001XW7IHC,"I own many different workout DVDs and this is hands-down my favorite because it gives EXCELLENT results!! Years ago I used it in VHS format after the birth of my youngest and I got back into shape very quickly.  Fast forward a few years and more than a few pounds later when I bought the DVD, then did the workouts consistently and got back into shape yet again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to reshape their bodies.",1455235200,,434,4.4125
8347881,5,B001XW7IHC,"Joyce's videos are wonderful, simple, comprehensive and basic...no frills, but all business, with some tough girl humor thrown in..
been working out with Joyce since her first book and find her still relevant and wonderful!",1430179200,,223,5.4

8347883,5,B001XW7IHC,This DVD is cardio and strength training in one.  Totally doable and a great workout.  You will sweat like crazy doing this one but it's great.  totally recommend this DVD.,1401840000,3,172,4.666666666666667
8347884,5,B001XW7IHC,"I'm really surprised no one else has reviewed this since it has been out a while.  This is one of her longer dvds and a terrific value for the workouts you get.  This is the workout that got Martha back in shape (Martha is on this dvd as well working out) after the birth of her baby.  You can see pics at Joyce's website of testimonials.  If you do this as she intends alternating days, you will reshape your body!  Don't think this is tame for women who have just given birth.  I am ""far removed"" from the pregnancy years and this will reshape your menopausal body or just plain overweight  body as well!  She is by far one of the best workouts out there. She uses three different weights.  Forget the new fads, Joyce will get you in shape if you put the effort in.  She is top notch.  If you can't do it all at first, you can work your way up to do more a little each day.  This is just about my favorite Joyce dvd.",1401148800,4,918,4.067039106145251
