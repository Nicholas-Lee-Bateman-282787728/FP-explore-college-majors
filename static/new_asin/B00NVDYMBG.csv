6680947,5,B00NVDYMBG,"Update (11/20/2014)
Because a few have notified me, I think it's wise to inform you folks that the $32.00 price tag for this deal was from Amazon's Deal of the Day.  Therefore, it only lasted for that day.  I do apologize if I may caused some confusion.

This deal is amazing; you can get 7 movies for about $32.00.  I don't see how you can complain about the pricing or what you're getting from the deal itself.  Yes it doesn't come with all the cool features and extra discs.  But if you're like me, and you're more interested in the movie than features, then don't hesitate.  If my math serves me right, each disc would be a little over $4.50.  Even if you're getting one disc per, it's still a great deal.  I've been waiting to purchase all the movies separately at some point, but I'm so glad I didn't, I would've spent so much more.

I'm not going to go in depth in terms of the movies themselves, but I admit the first few films are not that good.  A bit cheesy and don't compare to the more recent films. I would say X-1 through X-3 are on the bottom of the list.  Origins: Wolverine did improve from the first three films, but that's not saying much.  This film gave a better look into Wolverine's past before he became an X-Man.  X-Men: First Class got me back into the X-Men series.  I know some people that didn't enjoy the film because of its inconsistency with the comic and story line, but I pretty much treated it as a complete reboot.  It was a well written film that really went in depth with Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr's (Magneto) relationship before their conflict.  The Wolverine definitely regressed in terms of the story line quality.  It was nice seeing the film based in Japan, because it gave a different feel opposed to the other films, but his relationship with the other characters were just so stagnant and unbelievable.  There wasn't a good chemistry with the cast.  Now to my favorite film of the franchise, X-Men: Days of Future Past.  This film picked right up from where First Class left off, after the Cuban missile crisis.  This film was well written and they brought back the most relevant characters while adding some fun ones.  In addition, you really get to see a different side to Charles Xavier, which I enjoyed.  I highly recommend this film.

I know I was very vague with the review of the movies itself, but my review isn't to critique the movies but rather the great deal.  I highly urge any of you who haven't already purchased these films on blu-ray to purchase this deal.  If you already have a film (First Class), as I do, I still encourage you to purchase this deal, because you're still getting a great deal for the other films.  You won't get full length special features, but they still have some in this collection.  Trust me, you won't regret this purchase.",1416009600,34,2835,4.493150684931507
6680948,1,B00NVDYMBG,The wolverine collection is missing almost all the special features of every movie. They basically took all the old movies that have 2 discs and only put the first disc in this collection so the special features disc for all the movies is missing.  It even says disc one on some of the movies. So basically you get just the movie and that's it.,1416009600,87,344,4.375
6680949,5,B00NVDYMBG,Awesome deal. Even Black Friday won't be this cheap.,1416009600,5,52,4.888888888888889
6680950,5,B00NVDYMBG,"I Took Advantage on this special, My first Gold Box Purchase ever from Amazon. Prime Member as well. Love it.",1416009600,7,109,4.5
6680951,5,B00NVDYMBG,"This is a great bargain at only $30!  While some of the X-Men movies are better than others, overall the franchise is a strong one bringing great action, special effects, and interesting plots.  I won't go into a review of each movie, as there are already plenty to look at, but I will say that there really isn't a weak one in the collection.

I enjoy teaching with super hero movies, as there are often important themes at the heart of these movies.  The X-men franchise deals with such topics as revenge, love, family, discrimination, friendship, overcoming challenges, teamwork, etc.  My sons and I enjoy the action, plot and special effects, but also discussing the themes of the movies too.

The movies are 4-star material, but the price factor makes this an easy 5-star purchase.  Enjoy!",1416009600,28,794,4.794117647058823
6680952,5,B00NVDYMBG,"Wolverine in itself is already 29.99, and days of future past is 14.99. Needless to say, going to grab this now! Note that these are not in 3D.

6681003,3,B00NVDYMBG,"I bought this because it was on sale for Black Friday and it was cheaper than buying Days of Future Past by itself. If that hadn't been the case then I would have passed this up and guy DoFP by itself. Here's why.
Sure, X-Men 1 and 2 were good movies. They were good enough for me to be able to ignore all that they got wrong.  Then came X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. These are the movie equivalent of gonorrhea. You may have had fun getting there, but now it's pretty bad.
Then X-Men First Class came out which is the movie equivalent of getting that gonorrhea treated. You're okay now, but the wounds of the past are fresh in your mind.
I haven't seen The Wolverine yet, so I'm not quite sure if I need to make another STD comment or if all is still good.
That being said, Days of Future Past was really good. They got a lot of stuff wrong but it was entertaining enough for me to forgive them for the mistakes. Days of Future Past on it's own would get five stars.",1419811200,,975,4.131578947368421

6681053,5,B00NVDYMBG,obviously missing the last movie that isn't out yet but a great value if you don't own any of the movies.,1417996800,,105,4.0476190476190474
6681054,5,B00NVDYMBG,"I was skeptical of buying this set at first. I wasn't a fan of The Last Stand, or Origins as I felt they were completely horrible. But the main reason is because I love bonus material. Although this description doesn't say, there is bonus goodness with this set. Commentaries, making of documentaries, trailers, all the stuff you'd expect. Check it out if you don't have any of these on Blu-ray yet. It's probably cheaper than buying each film individually.",1417996800,,457,4.7974683544303796
