6080895,4,B00GKAMETO,I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the frenetic editing. It changes shots every three seconds & often focuses on a player when he isn't playing yet the audio indicates that he is.,1432425600,,185,4.314285714285714

8624031,5,B00GKAMETO,"A high point in terms of the Stones performance, but also one of the better videos in terms of editing.  The camera captures all of the musicians at relevant moments in contrast to some past videos which tended to follow Jagger exclusively.  Having Taylor on stage was a treat.  Jagger was at his best - great harmonica work as well.  Richards was fantastic.  Woods, Watts, Keys, and the rest were tight.",1473465600,,404,4.633802816901408

8624035,5,B00GKAMETO,What a great show I remember when the band was just a rhythm and blues band and just stood there and played songs. The Rolling Stones have really grown over the years and learned how to put a show on but the basic elements of the band are still there the rock n roll and blues roots. Mike Taylor was a nice add to the show and was very special and Mick Jagger's vocal are better then ever,1465776000,,388,3.9871794871794872
