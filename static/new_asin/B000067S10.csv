1720007,5,B000067S10,"This documentary is basically a synopsis of Sylvia Nasar's ""Beautiful Mind"" book, and therefore offers a sensitive and accurate portrayal of John Nash and his remarkable life (remarkable in both uplifting and distressing ways).  The narrative of the documentary has a good flow, and we get interview excerpts with his wife, sister, colleagues, wives of colleagues, a childhood friend, Nasar, and Nash himself.  The result is that we learn about many things, including the ambition of genius, solidarity in the mathematics community, the impacts of mental illness, the satisfaction of redemption, and the value of hope.  We don't learn much about game theory itself, but that's OK, since it's a very technical subject which is probably best learned from other dedicated sources anyway.

I highly recommend watching this documentary, and then following up with the book (or audiobook).  But I don't recommend watching the superficial and highly fictionalized ""Beautiful Mind"" movie, which I consider to be bordering on rubbish.",1316044800,,1025,5.421383647798742
1720008,5,B000067S10,"I showed this documentary to my students after showing ""A Beautiful Mind"".  It was a great way to open up a discussion about how mental illness is depicted in film.  I highly recommend this film.",1307145600,,195,4.542857142857143
1720009,5,B000067S10,"I teach AP Economics and use this video as part of my unit on the application of game theory to oligopolistic market structures.  This video is factually accurate, unlike the movie it followed, so it is a way to bring the now famous mathematician to life as well as his contributions to game theory and how they have been applied to various types of economic analysis.",1257206400,,368,4.575757575757576
1720010,5,B000067S10,"This explanation of John Nash's life is better and more inspiring than the movie version (Beautiful Mind).

It displays a wonderful (though apparentlly immensely painful) transformation of a genius, fixated on accolades and self fulfillment, to a truly generous, forthright, and caring person who ultimately got the acclaim he desired.

It is also a poignant and deserved tribute to the endurance of those who loved and cared for him. It brings to mind thoughts of Godly redemption.

Hurray for John Nash and his family and friends.",1128297600,4,532,5.162790697674419
1720011,5,B000067S10,"If the film A Beautiful Mind left you non-plussed, don't worry.  Where Beautiful Mind was strewn with Hollywood concocted implausibilities and only hinted at the real, far more interesting story of John Nash, this *is* the real story and in this case, the real story is about 50 times more interesting than Hollywood's tricked up version.  Where I didn't really care for Beautiful Mind, I found this documentary riveting.  One of my favorite films, it is a fascinating study of a unique individual, his affliction, and his gift.  And if you liked the Holywood version, you will still love having the holes in that story filled.  Highest recommendation.",1080864000,17,652,5.0
1720012,5,B000067S10,"This is a good work to watch after seeing the Ron Howard film. It gives a fuller picture of John Nash's life and trials. Nash comes off as the typical eccentric professor one encounters in university settings but he's very likable. You don't have to be a math and economics expert to be in awe of Nash's accomplishments. You will also admire his friends and family's dedication during his roughest periods.
My only annoynance was the commentary. The filmmakers seemed to be too caught up in the technical aspects of the film such as lighting, camera work, etc. It just seemed out of place for a documentary.",1043798400,11,607,4.682242990654205
1720013,5,B000067S10,"It's been about a year since Ron Howard released the film ""A Beautiful Mind"" based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of the same name.
Some viewers found the film superficial and not a faithful, complete representation of Nash's life.  A few readers found the book a little inaccessible with its detail and its extensive footnoting and documentation.
""A Brilliant Madness"" allows viewers to examine the life of John Nash with the accessibility of the movie and the credibility of the book.
""A Brilliant Madness"" starts with the early boyhood of Nash and chronicles his life to the point where he receives the Nobel Prize.  It includes footage narrated by Nash himself, his wife, his sister, fellow mathematicians, and biographer Nassar.  It shows both his achievements and his illness.  It includes large blocks of his life that the movie leaves out.
I can understand why a feature-type movie could not accurately and completely document a life as complex and multi-faceted as Nash's.  It would have to develop too many characters, explain too many complex mathematical formulas, and go in too many directions.  The movie does a good job of showing who he is through the art of the film.
The book, on the other hand, goes into much more detail and is very good for a reader who wants to commit some effort to understanding both Nash's accomplishments and his illness.  It is very thorough and remarkably accessible for such a thorough treatment.
""A Brilliant Madness,"" however does a fine job of presenting a credible introduction to Nash's life and work in a relatively short time.  Viewers whose interest is peaked can then seek out ""A Beautiful Mind"" if they so desire.",1037923200,42,1666,4.925

7963602,3,B000067S10,"How did they manage to make such a fascinating person amd his story so unintersting?  The feature on John Nash that came in the special features of ""A Beautiful Mind"" was 100 times more interesting and revealing.",1369267200,,212,4.72972972972973

7963604,4,B000067S10,"Overall, I liked this documentary about John Nash's life. It's a nice contrast when you watch it after the movie. It appears that the movie did not entirely reflect the truth. Picture and sound quality were all good, and I enjoyed the interviews with actual colleagues, his sister, his son. I also found the psychiatrists' views helpful in understanding his illness and how he recovered. And of course, hearing John Nash himself talking about his career and illness was nice.
I wish the documentary had explored/explained John Nash's work in more detail. I was expecting a more detailed exposition of his equilibrium concept, its significance for economics and how it was different from classical economics. I felt that the work got the short shrift, and his illness and personality got the most attention. I would have loved to hear him talk about his thought process and how he arrived at the idea and so on. All in all, I think it's a valuable addition to any DVD library and a nice complement to the movie, but I don't think it's the most educating, informative or arresting documentary I have seen.",1362441600,,1103,4.810526315789474
7963605,5,B000067S10,I learned more about John Nash than I learned about him in A Beautiful Mind.  It was wonderful listening to and seeing him speak in the documentary.  It is wonderful.,1361836800,,166,4.5
