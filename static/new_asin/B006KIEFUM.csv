Andrews Blu-ray Review: A Bug's Life is a film retelling of the Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper with Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai being a heavy influence on the plot. Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Andrew Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw. The ants in the film were re-designed to be more appealing, and PIXAR's animation unit employed new technical innovations in computer animation.

After the great success they had with Toy Story, everyone was wondering if Pixar could repeat their success or if they were going to be the Hollywood equivalent to a one-hit-wonder. Their sophomore film, A Bug's Life, turned out to be just as strong as their first feature and the rest, as they say, is history. At long last Disney has gone back into PIXAR's catalogue of films and started to release them in high definition. They have done a truly magnificent job too, crafting a disc with impeccable sound and a stunningly beautiful image. This is definitely a must buy for all fans of awesome animation.

Flick is an ant who lives in a colony that is being tormented by a swarm of grasshoppers. Every year the grasshoppers descend on the ant hill and steal most of their food, leaving them barely enough to live. When Flick accidently destroys the food intended for the grasshoppers, he decides to travel to the big city in order to find a group of warriors who will defend his village. Instead of finding seven samurais however, due to a misconception on his part, Flick returns with a recently fired group of circus insects who know nothing of war or battle.

There are a couple of things that separates PIXAR films from the run-of-the-mill 'family-friendly' animated film. The technical wizardry and the very tight storytelling are all part of it, but for my money the main thing is that their movies have is heart, sympathetic characters that you can empathize with. None of their films show this off better than A Bug's Life. Poor Flick is an everyman (or should I say every bug) who is never appreciated for his contributions and who is punished for every good deed he does. Who hasn't had a kind gesture backfire or made a dreadful mistake? He's easy to relate to, and the deeper into trouble he gets the more you feel for him, especially since he has a kind heart.

Added to that is a very tight script, one where every scene serves a purpose and is integral to the movie. The animation that PIXAR creates is very time intensive and they don't want to generate any scenes that won't be in the final product. Because of that they re-write the movie over and over and over again until the script is perfect. The process literally takes years, but the result is a well thought out movie where every scene, line of dialog, and even movement has been planned for maximum effect. Take the scene where Flick tries to cheer up Princess Dot who is down because she's too little to fly. He can't find a seed for his parable, so he gives her a small rock and tell her to imagine it's a seed. He compares a single seed to a mighty Oak, stating that there is greatness in even the most unlikely packages. Dot replies ""But it's only a rock"" getting a big laugh, but later hands Flick a rock when he's down and thinking he's a failure. It cheers him up, and perplexes the circus bugs to no end. This simple segment not only introduces one of the movie's themes, but gets some big laughs at the same time.

Finally, there's the brilliant animation itself. While Toy Story was fun to watch, A Bug's Life is a total beautiful work of art. Every shot looks like a perfectly composed photograph and the entire film is dazzling to see. Even without the excellent story this movie would be a joy to sit through because it is so beautiful. Especially the last shot, a pull away of the small island with a tree where the entire battle had taken place.

Blu-ray Video Quality  In one word: perfection. The previous release DVD for 'A Bug's Life' was the first direct digital-to-digital transfer, without any analogue in-between, and it was a sight to behold, for sure. But this 1080p encoded image and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 is just unparalleled or at least only comparable to other PIXAR Blu-ray releases). Colours threaten to pop off the screen and the details are unparalleled, definition is strong and sharp, and there is nothing (and I mean nothing) in the way of technical blips- no macro-blocking, no artefacts, no edge-enhancement. This is just a beautiful, beautiful image. It is totally stunning in every way. I'd like to go into more detail, but this image really doesn't require any more. Perfection pretty much sums it up.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track has everything you could want from a surround track, and much much more. Instead of a normal audio track of a comedy release, which would have all the dialogue in the front speakers, this mix judiciously spreads the voices out amongst the different speakers. Part of this has to do with the sheer scale of the movie - there are a ton of speaking characters, and many more extras. What's more - the dialogue is never drowned out or obscured. This may seem like an odd thing to applaud, but the effect is staggering. The surround sound really gets a workout, too, in scenes of greater action (with the back speakers really worked vigorously) especially Hopper's gang of grasshoppers approaching the ant colony at full mast; Flick's arrival at Bug City, in which everything is alive; the attack by the vicious bird; the rain drops that fall like depth charges from a WWII submarine. For my money, this mix blows away most of the overactive sound mixes of big Hollywood action pictures. So, in short: this is an atmospheric, immersive mix that will leave you breathless. It is just totally magnificent awesome audio surround experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Geri's Game [4:55] This is the Oscar winning PIXAR animation short. The film is set in an empty park during Autumn. The title character, Geri (voiced by Bob Peterson), is an elderly man who plays a game of chess against himself, ""becoming"" each of the players in turn by moving to the other side of the chessboard, where he changes his personality and either puts on or takes off his glasses to show this change. As the game progresses, it seems as though there are two people playing; at one point, the hands of both ""opponents"" are in frame. Black Geri (without the glasses) soon gains the upper hand over White Geri (with them), capturing every piece except his king and putting him in check. Finding that now he is the one with only his king left and discovering what has happened, Black Geri resigns the game and hands over a set of dentures as the prize. White Geri puts them in, then chuckles and grins in his victory, before the camera pulls back to reveal that he is alone at the chessboard. If you haven't seen it, then you are in for a real treat.

Filmmaker's Roundtable [21.00] This is one of my favourite features on the entire disc. It's a roundtable discussion with John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, producer Darla K. Anderson, and producer Kevin Reher. What makes this so nice is that the majority of the special features on the disc were from the original 2-disc special edition released in 1999. So to see all the principles older and wiser and looking back on the experience is really nice. You get to see that the production of the movie was a nice combination of hard work and silly, silly fun; a must-watch special feature.

A Bug's Life: The First Draft [10:49] This is also really, really cool. As it is introduced by John Lasseter, this is a minimally animated version of the original story of 'A Bug's Life,' which is so far removed from what wound up in the final movie that it's unbelievable. The best part is that they got Dave Foley back to narrate this story reel, which makes it feel like a bedtime story. This is really great stuff, and proof that there should be quality over quantity.

Walt Disney Silly Symphony: Grasshopper and the Ants [1934] [8:15] The Grasshopper and the Ants is a 1934 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. Part of the Silly Symphonies series, the animation film is an adaptation of The Ant and the Grasshopper, one of Aesop's Fables. It was directed by Wilfred Jackson and stars Pinto Colvig as the voice of the grasshopper ""Hop."" Silly Symphonies, this was an early example of the idea of having a character turn blue with cold, when full-spectrum Technicolor was still new at the time. John Lasseter introduction, says that he begged Disney to let him include this short film on the DVD. It was a huge inspiration for the crew of 'A Bug's Life' and is a welcome addition to the special features package.

Audio Commentary with Directors John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton and Editor Lee Unkrich: A great commentary by some creative juggernauts. They're super smart and funny and it should be noted that Lee Unkrich is the director of 'Toy Story 3.' Well worth the listen.

Pre-Production:

1. Fleabie Reel [Play with intro 4.19 or Play without intro 3.19] This was part of a Walt Disney Pictures presentation reel, but since none of the animation for 'A Bug's Life' (at the time, just called 'Bugs') was finished, it's John Lasseter and other Pixar folks goofing off. It's pretty entertaining.

2. Story and Editorial [Play with intro 5.33 or Play without intro 4.41] This briefly takes you through the story process, as well as editorial, in terms of how the movie is shaped initially. In animation it's sort of the reverse of live action filmmaking, where you have to edit everything BEFORE they go into production.

3. Storyboard-to-Film Comparison [Play All with intro 13:22] This follows the evolution of a sequence called ""Dot's Rescue,"" going from the story reel, to the final render, and finally ending with a split screen comparison.

4. Abandoned Sequences [Play All with intro 5:34] Here are a couple of sequences that were cut before they ever made it to final animation. So see them here in rough form, with mostly still storyboards. One is called ""P.T. Flea's Office"" and almost made it to the animation stage, which takes place right after the circus bugs' abysmal circus performance in Big City. The other one is ""Original Museum Opening,"" which saw an elderly docent begin to tell the story of 'A Bug's Life' to a bunch of school-aged ants. Both are repetitive and unnecessary; cut for good reason.

5. Research Documentary [Play with intro 5:24 or Play without into 4.10] This details the filmmakers as they shot grass, leaves etc. with a tiny video camera. It's sort of like a low budget version of 'Microcosmos,' the great documentary film as seen from a bug's eye view.

Production [34.00] Comprised of five segments in all, this portion of the disc provides a quick overview of the production's groundwork. It features Behind The Scenes of A Bugs Life  Production Feature Documentary [3.46]; Voice Casting [4.12]; Early Tests [5.25] and Progression Demonstration [Storyreel [3.56]; Layout [2.54]; Animation[ 2.54] and Shades and Lighting [2.59].

Sound Design Feature [13:07] Hosted by the movie's incredible sound designer [and future PIXAR director] Gary Rydstrom, shares his insights about building the world of A Bugs Life from real-world sounds.

Theatrical Releases: A Bugs Life No. 1 Trailer [1.02]; Trailer No. 2 [2.35] The first trailer is a typical PIXAR teaser, with very little given away besides the basic premise and colour scheme of the movie. The second trailer is on the opposite end of the spectrum and it seems to never end and gives away virtually everything.

Character Interviews [Play with intro 2.00 or Play without intro 1.30] This is a little piece of animation that's supposed to be ""character interviews"" via satellite link up of the bug characters. It's interesting to note that they couldn't get Dennis Leary or Kevin Spacey to take part in this bit of silliness, so co-director Andrew Stanton provides the voice of Hopper (couldn't quite figure out who voiced Francis the lady bug).

Outtakes: The Story Behind The Outtakes [3.17]; Original Outtakes [2.13] and Alternate Outtakes [2.30]

Sneak Peaks: Toy Story 3: The Video Game; Beverley Hills Chihuahua 2; The Search For Santa Paws; Disneyland Paris Trailer; Disney 3D Blu-ray Promotion and Disney/PIXAR Presents Cars Toons Maters Tall Tales [9 Short Animations].

Finally, a fantastic masterpiece animation film, that is often unjustly ignored when discussing any of the PIXAR animation films. This is a shame since the film features a meaty ambitious plot, colourful characters, and breath-taking animation. A Bug's Life has never looked or sounded better. Definitely a reference-level Blu-ray disc all the way around, this animation film will really show off your system. Added to that, there are some great bonus material and also including a couple of nice exclusive features. This is a great disc all the way around and easily earns the top notch Andrews Blu-ray Review Series rating. Ever since I had this originally on a NTSC DVD I have loved this film, but now having it in my Blu-ray Collection it has blown me away, as the images are absolutely mind blowing awesome and you see the animation in a whole new dimension and that is why I feel PIXAR is THE No. 1 Animation Producers for us in the 21st Century. If you want to impress your friends, then this Blu-ray is the one to really knock their socks off. Highly Recommended!
