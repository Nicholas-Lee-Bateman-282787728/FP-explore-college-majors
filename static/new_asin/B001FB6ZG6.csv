3582996,5,B001FB6ZG6,A young man's coming of age film that is beautifully acted with amazing photography.  It is truly a great film that should be seen by all film lovers,1229904000,2,149,4.321428571428571
3582997,5,B001FB6ZG6,"I saw this movie twice in Austin this fall, and I can't wait to get the DVD when it comes out in January. The cinematography is beautiful!

The film was not at all what I expected. As the story unfolded I was struck by how well the directors had cast the lead character, Peter (played by Jeremy Strong). His character was so believable.

The film has lots of humorous moments as well as a gut-wrenching ending.

Other characters were great too. Charity, played by child actor Madison Davenport, was delightful to watch. What a natural!

Casting, filming, and storyline-- all are great.",1227312000,,585,4.705882352941177
3582998,4,B001FB6ZG6,"One of the perks of having Direct TV is getting to view first run movies in my home for free! 'Humboldt County' is a very good film, portraying pot smokers, not as cartoonish morons who can't finish a sentence or thought, but smart people who choice the ""herb"" over booze.

The story centers around a young medical student who has had his whole life planned out for him by his domineering father who is not really there for him. Insightful and touching this film refrains from the usual stoner gags and plays more like a character study about ""pot farmers"" and a young man's growing pains. Brad Douif, Jeremy Strong and young Madison Davenport give deep performances in this excellent little film!",1224547200,3,697,4.713114754098361
3583009,4,B001FB6ZG6,"Unlike so many posters here, I didn't see this as a movie about pot, pro or con. That's just the milieu. I saw it as a tragedy. It is about what happens when you are brought up in an environment isolated from the world, know only one way of life, and can't escape from it. It could have been about the Amish and still have the same message. Chris Messina steals every movie he's in, and the movie is worth it for his performance alone.  Although he is better than the movie itself, I gave it four stars because I think more people need to discover Messina as more than just a supporting actor or Danny Castellano. He's one of our finest actors.",1446076800,,644,4.235772357723577

This grim little film offers little in the way of enlightenment and resolution - nothing much of value can pierce the perpetual and impenetrable fog of pot smoke mixed with dispair. The film is beautifully written, cast and shot and the actors do an excellent job of portraying good people who have lost their way in a coastal forest paradise without ever leaving home.",1405641600,,556,4.989247311827957

I in fact watched it twice( unfortunately) just to be sure I didn't miss some epic message or good feeling at the end. Nope, the 2nd time just solidified this heap of garbage. So they filmed some redwoods... hooray. But someone NOT from Humboldt County made a movie about what he thought it would be like if he ran away to the Redwood Curtain and stumbles upon the ""mom&pop"" lifestyle. Well Mr MovieWriter, thank you for publicising our rural home and making a HUGE cultural miss while you were at it.

3583033,5,B001FB6ZG6,"I've always heard of Humboldt County as the place where some of the finest cannabis is grown for medicinal & recreational use.  But watching the film, which filmed in Humboldt County or as they say the Emerald Triangle was amazing. I got a glimpse of how beautiful the area is in northern Cali.  The actors and actresses did a wonderful job, showing how the main character studied and worked himself until he started getting burned out and how he finally met up, through Bogart, with a family of pot growers.  It is thought provoking in the sense that the rat race will eat up your life before you know it and no amount of money can compensate for lost years. The movie made you care for the characters, which is somewhat rare now-a-days, no blowing things up no CGI effects ect, just people interating with each other and some circumstances that are brought up throughout the film.  To the writers/producers/directors great job, to the cast excellent job.  I for one am jaded with the insubstantial garbage that are called movies, which ends up becoming background noise.

I have spent ALOT of time in Humboldt County and find it to be one of the most mellow incredible places on earth and to reduce it to a bunch of great actors portray such insipid characters was overwhelmingly sophmoric, and was deeply saddened to see this sacred place reduced to Cheech & Chong references.  I will watch again without sound as I miss the opulent serene beauty well captured, kudos to the DP! Did not like the sound track, should listen to KRFH, HSU local radio station to be more inspired!!!! Glad to see Peter B. w/o the peach scarf, looking good!

3583037,4,B001FB6ZG6,"HUMBOLDT COUNTY  is a taste f the 60s and 70s drug culture when many disillusioned people, young and old, picked up and moved to the scenic wonder - and pot farms  - of Humboldt County, California.  Darren Grodsky and Danny Jacobs co-wrote and co-directed this little throw back in history and the result is a bit of nostalgia and some fine characterizations by a solid cast.

Jerry Hadley (Jeremy Strong) is a medical student trumped by his medical school professor father (Peter Bogdanovich) into failing medical school, and the only apparent way for the fairly clueless and disillusioned Jerry is to try the world outside. He begins with a strange relationship with Bogart (Fairuza Balk) and ends up headed to Humboldt County where he encounters folks living off the profits (both mentally and economically) of growing marijuana.  He becomes friends with the free spirits Max (Chris Messina), Rosie (Frances Conroy), Jack (Brad Dourif) and in the midst of the atmosphere, Jerry 'inhales' and begins to figure out where his life should actually be headed.

The movie seems to be a bit of fluff, but written into the lines is a lot of wise philosophy - if you choose to take it that way.  Good performances and a clever script make the movie a nice diversion.  Grady Harp, December 11",1324512000,2,1285,4.835616438356165
3583038,4,B001FB6ZG6,"Peter fails out of medical school. His dad is the one who actually fails him.

Peter is a pathetic loner, wall flower, very straight type of guy. He meets jazz singer, Bogart (as in don't bogart that joint my friend) played by Fairuza Balk. She seduces Peter rather quickly and they end up going back to her secluded home, which was about a day's drive away. Here Bogart meets her boyfriend, Max, as well as a large extended family.

They grow pot for a living. Peter is like a fish out of water and wants to leave, but has no transportation. After Peter spends the night, Bogart leaves the movie never to return. Peter, living with strangers, eventually tries the pot and adopts his new family as they get stoned and talk about how to run a colony on Mars.

Brad Dourif gives us the best performance as the ex-professor now pot grower. This is not a stoner movie, but a movie about people getting stoned.",1281052800,,905,4.4397590361445785

The main character, a struggling med student, spends the entire movie with one befuddled expression on his face, like he is astonished and shocked by every single thing and person and comment he encounters all day every day and night.

3583041,2,B001FB6ZG6,"When you encounter problems right at the start of a movie it does not bode well for the remaining parts. Specifically the sound quality and articulation by actors varied so much that it was difficult to understand important dialogue. Add to that, that the producing studio, in taking short cuts to save money, did not offer subtitles.
The characters are well developed to the point of looking as if clipped from stereotypic people stickers. For example, after 8 years of education a medical student can't pass a simple oral exam then in solace meets a singer in a bar and after a brief obligatory unseen sex scene they take it trip to a pot growing commune. He meets the stereotypic intelligentsia professional dropouts spending time smoking and looking at trees and water while avoiding obligatory law enforcement disruptions to their growing activities. In summation, there is nothing new or creative in the substance and presentation of issues in this movie.",1248825600,4,961,5.0125

3583043,4,B001FB6ZG6,"We love the real Humboldt County (have a college student at Humboldt State!) and hoped this film would go beyond the usual Cheech-and-Chong image of the Great Wet North as just a bunch of spaced out potheads.  Yes, it does center on the culture of California's #1 unofficial cash crop, but it's a wonderful, quirky journey of self-discovery for the alienated urban Stranger in a Strange Land who finds himself suddenly stranded there, and for the local denizens as well, told with humor, affection, tragedy and style.  Some major established talents appear in this movie, obviously because they loved the story & the characters they got to play (not a Big Bucks production but very professionally crafted).  Love the film and DON't miss the hilarious ""Making of"" extra -- it's worth the price of the DVD alone!",1243382400,2,810,4.897810218978102

3583045,5,B001FB6ZG6,"On the surface, Humboldt County is about a nerdish young medical student brushing up against marijuana farmers; but it's really a coming of age story in many ways. It's also a rather moving story. The acting is superlative and the cinematography couldn't have been better. The choreography for chase scenes is very well done; and the plot moves along at a good pace although perhaps just a few minutes could have been cut from the first hour or so of the movie.

When the action starts, we meet a young medical student, Peter Hadley, who is taking a final exam to pass medical school and get into a top notch medical residency program. Unfortunately Peter's professor--who is also his father--fails him because Peter prescribes the wrong medicine and treatment for the make-believe patient. Just before she leaves, the make-believe patient hands Peter a flyer about her jazz performance that night. Peter spends the night in the jazz club trying to feel better and he also has some romantic time alone with Bogart.

The next morning, Peter decides to go to Bogart's home with her even though he's way too sleepy to even ask where ""home"" is. As it turns out, her home is in Humboldt County in Northern California where many people grow and even farm marijuana. Peter is at first shocked and almost mortified by the whole thing--and things only get worse for Peter when he learns that Bogart has left the house where several people live and nobody knows when she'll return.

At first Peter is desperate to return to Los Angeles, but over time Peter learns to have increasing respect and compassion for these marijuana farmers who live off the land, respect each other and, in their own ways, love each other as one big extended family. A loving family is something Peter never had at all when he grew up; and slowly he enjoys being with them more and more. However, as the movie progresses there are some not so happy events as well.

What happens when Peter's father finally tracks him down and wants him to return to Los Angeles with him? What about the people Peter meets--Max, the young girl Charity, Jack and Rosie who ""escaped"" from UCLA where Peter attended medical school and Jack once taught physics, Bob and Steve? Will the marijuana farmers ever be caught by the feds? Will the local police catch them instead? Watch and find out!

There are a couple of bonus featurettes about making the movie but they're done in a way that pokes fun somewhat at this type of bonus feature. We do get some deleted scenes as well.

Humboldt County has a compelling message about accepting life the way it actually is, the true meaning of growing up and discovering what you really want to do with your life. It also delivers a strong message about the unconventional meaning of ""family"" as well. I highly recommend this film.",1236902400,18,2818,4.705882352941177
3583046,4,B001FB6ZG6,"Being a long-time Humboldt County resident, I have been to every identifiable scene in this movie. I was expecting a bad movie, but they really pulled this off nicely. Great cinematography, excellent acting, and a great sound track that blended right in with the rest of the movie. (But Fairuza Balk's jazz act really stood out for me.)

My only complaint was that I could not hear some of the lines toward the beginning. Whisper-level lines are a no no. But it seemed that the sound crew did a better job as the movie progressed.

Highly recommended, and a must-see for locals or those with an interest in the back-to-the-land lifestyle.",1236124800,2,638,4.738738738738738

3583048,5,B001FB6ZG6,"I've seen this film several times and I have to say it gets better each time. I missed a lot the first time and wasn't too sure about it. I then saw it on the big screen and couldn't believe the difference. The scenery alone makes it. The acting is superb as is the directing. It's not a stoner movie or a movie about pot. It's a (dark) story about people in that environment. It has guilt, as well as lot's of love for their fellow man and the acceptance of an outsider without having met him before. It's truly a beautifully directed piece of art from top to bottom. Way to go Darren and Danny. Can't wait to see what you come up with next!!",1234137600,2,643,4.111111111111111

3583070,5,B001FB6ZG6,"Honestly - I bought this movie without really reading the reviews - I just made sure it had plenty of good scenes showing northern california and I bought it.  I spent a couple of years attending Humboldt State University - I ran on the track team - rode my mountain bike in the forest, and made some friends.  I didn't smoke or wear flowery girlie shirts.  I didn't run away to Moonstone beach to ""find myself.""  I debated the NORML people on campus and got into plenty of arguments with the hippies from Los Angeles.

I gotta say - I loved this movie.  This movie did not go ""where I thought it was going to go.""  This movie was not a pro-marijuana advertisement, nor was it an anti-drug propaganda.  This movie really showed both sides of the debate for the legalization of marijuana - but, moreover, this movie showed how ""other people"" live in our country.  How escaping accepted society can open your eyes - how staying true to who you are is really the best drug.

This film falls into my category of ""thank god a rich hollywood producer didn't make this film"" category.  You know, like the movies coming out of mexico and spain - and now of-course slumdog.  These are the types of movies that have high paid actors and hollywood producers scared.  They gotta be getting scared because these movies are, in my humble(d) opinion, far better than the sewage coming out of hollywood.

Get the movie - you'll like it.",1233619200,43,1420,4.517647058823529

3583072,4,B001FB6ZG6,"An interesting film that received little to no commercial release and has relied on a lot of internet, word-of-mouth, and independent publicity to make itself known. I had mixed emotions watching this film. The scenery it absolutely stunning and really resonates with anyone who has actually visited or lived in Northern California. The story itself is a bittersweet tale of a young student who has difficulty relating to other people, is wrestling with his own lack of emotions, and has a severely dysfunctional relationship with his father. He inadvertantly ends up taking a ride to Northern California with a young jazz singer and is soon immersed in the eccentricities, lives, and times of local marijuana farmers. He manages to find himself in some regards during this strange odyssey, but these changes are not gained without some real losses along the way, and is ultimately left unresolved in terms of his own ""event horizon"". I enjoyed the film. My friends and I got several chuckles out of it, and I would be lying if said I didn't feel a tear (or two) during the evening we saw it.",1232582400,,1092,4.8449197860962565

Scenery, plot, actors - all the standard elements are really well done, but the feeling and atmosphere are phenomenal. You also get to know a world (pot farming) that doesn't fit with the stereotype of the drug trade, and is probably more accurate than anyone's pre-conceived notions.  If you're intelligent, you'll probably like this movie.",1232409600,,497,4.689655172413793
3583074,2,B001FB6ZG6,"My review was removed so re-posted as I was given a great deal of unpopular votes last time...Following on the tails of many pot films this quarter, Humboldt pulls no punches with the cover art and embraces the marijuana theme with a huge joint on the cover along with Balk pictured front and center.

Simply enough, this is a tediously long film containing numerous pot-induced discussions on such things as colonizing Mars and the meaning of many things in the character's lives revolving around the necessity of growing and smoking dope. The highlights of the story are the various and often used scenery locales in and around the said named County. Absolutely beautiful - would love to see them in BD. Otherwise, the story drags on indefinitely with several long takes that involve nothing except, well, nothing. The performances are fine, the script was easy enough when you have scenes involving beating up an abandoned vehicle for no reason, smoking dope with your children, blah, blah, blah.

The DVD has two painful docus that apparently are meant to be funny, with the directors ""ambushing"" their stars for interviews but being mistaken for other directors - lame. The main docu has the 2 directors sitting and eating cereal out of the bag as they loathe the process of film making (in a jest fashion I assume). The deleted scenes had the funniest scene removed and is almost worth the watch.

SPOILERS:

Balk disappears 20 minutes into the film so do not see this for her sake. Bogdanovich appeared without effort, and his longest scene is at the end as he eats a sandwich (no dialogue) for 6 minutes. So I would say this is meant for the HC locals and hardcore dopers. Several of my usual dope film customers have already returned it having been bored, and most people have felt the tragic ending was misplaced and not needed. Not sure why there were so many high marks (sorry) but this film is not worth more than a discounted rental.",1231804800,2,1947,4.734513274336283

About a guy who failed in medical school at UCLA by his professor father. He meets a paid acting test subject volunteer (also a jazz singer) for his final evaluation and prescribes her the wrong medication and fails.  He then follows the night time jazz singer to Humboldt County and she introduces him to a vast array of electic characters who are marijuana farmers struggling against the Feds who occasionally raid their farms and rob them of their livelyhood. The farmers are also, of course, her family and some extended families are along for the ride. Things get complex, but it is simple enough to follow. There is hope and redemption and good closure at the end. Worth the watch because of the vast array of emotional and universal human conditions.

8301785,5,B001FB6ZG6,"Do yourself a favor, watch this film and visit the Lost Coast.  It truly is a magical place that I never heard of until I watched this film. The filming locations they chose truly capture the beauty and character of Humboldt County, although it rains a lot in the winter. I could watch this movie just for the scenery alone. I wish there were more shots of the Trinidad beaches, although Luffenholtz is my favorite place for watching the waves crash. Peter and Max should've gone on a hike down College Cove or Trinidad State Park before Peter just randomly decides he wants to smoke pot and ditch the sweater vest because those are the places that helped me embrace the Humboldt culture.

This film is more than just a bunch of hippies sitting around smoking pot. It is about the struggle of finding that healthy balance of structure and relaxation. Peter and Max are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, but as the film progresses they start to learn from each other and start to doubt their current lifestyles. We find that Max grows pot to give his daughter a more structured and stable life that he doesn't have and Peter rejects the residency because he knows that he isn't happy with rigid schedules and constant studying. Throughout the film, Jack seems to enjoy the carefree Humboldt lifestyle, but once Max dies he realizes he's wasted the last 25 years of his life doing pointless research.

I think the ending of this film was perfect. I've always been a fan of films that have an open end where you can create your own ending. I believe that Peter had no idea where that bus was heading, and he was hoping to find his next new, random adventure wherever that bus took him. Every time I watch this film, I am reminded that I need to stop worrying about everyday life and know that things have a way of working out in the end.",1515283200,2,1838,4.480597014925373
