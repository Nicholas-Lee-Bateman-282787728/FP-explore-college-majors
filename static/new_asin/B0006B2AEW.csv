8040996,1,B0006B2AEW,"BUYER BEWARE! If you have 20/20 vision and an HD TV, You will NOT be happy with this Extremely POOR ""Digital Remastering"" of this item. I have a VHS copy of some of these movies, which are significantly of better quality than this totally inept, or better, BOTCHED, job of remastering. Yes. I know, Remastering is NOT Restoring, but still, the quality of this set is, at best, a D+! Hope this review helps!",1426636800,,406,4.5
8040997,5,B0006B2AEW,"I purchased this product because Cary Grant was my favorite actor, totally class and excellence.  The movies were among the essentials and I just had to have them for my collection.",1287878400,,181,4.838709677419355
8040998,5,B0006B2AEW,"I received my product in great time, and in exactly the same condition it was listed as. How could you ask for any better? If you're a Cary Grant fan, I'd highly recommend buying stuff from this seller!!",1287360000,,203,4.368421052631579
8040999,4,B0006B2AEW,"I bought this mainly for His Girl Friday. It also has Amazing Adventure (1936), Penny Serenade (1941), and 1950 Hollywood behind-the-scenes feature, plus 10 Grant movie trailers.

The quality of His Girl Friday was pretty good. Very watchable, much better than some of the bad copies out there. Not quite as good as a restored studio issue, but the quality is not distracting at all. Great considering the low price. Just sit back and watch the craziness ensue!",1098403200,6,461,4.910256410256411
