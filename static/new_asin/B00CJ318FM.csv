5723148,5,B00CJ318FM,I have been a fan of Agatha Christie's books on Poirot and Miss Marple. I have tried to order every DVD on these characters.  Get acquainted if you can with these great mystery stories and Poirot.,1392163200,,196,4.444444444444445
5723149,5,B00CJ318FM,I already own it I got it for my doughter - our family loves Poirot !! & all though 13 is going to be very sad we can't wait to get it.,1391385600,,135,3.25
5723150,5,B00CJ318FM,"Love the Poirot series and this is no exception. If you are a collector of mysteries, this series has got to be included. Good video and sound that will continue to please for a long time into the future.",1390694400,,204,4.256410256410256
5723151,5,B00CJ318FM,"Four great mysteries solved by the greatest detective of them all.  If you like David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, you will like this DVD collection.",1388793600,,146,4.84
5723152,5,B00CJ318FM,"My husband & I are hugh fans of Hercule Poirot (you might say addicted) because we get a bit panicky if we think we're coming close to the end of our supply.  I never expected to enjoy this eccentric, intelligent Belgian to such a degree.  Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery.  Highly recommend.",1387497600,,299,4.5
5723153,5,B00CJ318FM,"I was beginning to wonder if the Definitive Collection of Poirot would ever come to Blu Ray Disc. The Early Cases did and are absolutely magnificent. If you haven't seen the Early Cases on blu ray, you should. We were blown away at how great yhey looked and sounded. However, there is still series 10 which I'm wondering why it isn't released for preorder as well ( episodes ""Mystery on the Blue Train, Taken At the Flood, After the Funeral, Cards on the Table"").  In the Movie Collection,  movie collection 6 is on blu ray, but not movie collections 4 and 5. Go figure. I hope A & E, and Acorn Media complete the entire series and movies in blu ray.",1376870400,7,650,4.363636363636363
5723154,5,B00CJ318FM,"I was beginning to despair of this & series 7 & 8 coming to bluRay. series 9 saw the departure from the old formula but a compelling trend toward darker, even more character driven mysteries. all 4 are excellent: The Hollow & Five Little Pigs are superlative. I just watched Death on the Nile on my Aussie DVD [the only anamorphic widescreen versions at the time] for the umpteenth time; excellent stuff. October is too far away.

And there's this fine Belgian man who ties it all expertly together.",1376352000,6,499,4.606741573033708
5723155,5,B00CJ318FM,"These four episodes/mini-movies are just as good as some of the original Poirot series. David Suchet is - as always - a consummate Poirot. Hugh Frasier is still the standup Hastings we love to see and Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon is as ever the perfect ying to Poirot's yang.  If you have not yet seen these 4 episodes then you should - and if you've not yet read them either - you should, however that said I don't want to go in to detail about them as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who has not yet seen them.  The brief descriptions provided by amazon are enough of a synopsis I think.  I hope you watch these if you've seen any of the others!  If not, I say start with the series in order - which is not necessary but it does add a hint of completeness and - personally, I never get tired of watching them.",1376092800,8,820,4.10625
5723156,5,B00CJ318FM,"I eagerly ordered this DVD set of Season 9 Poirot with the expectation that it would play on my Blue Ray player as the other sets I bought of Miss Marple manufactured in Spain had done. You can well imagine my complete disappointment when it refused to play!! The Miss Marple and the Poirot DVD products are distributed by LLamentol, however the Poirot DVD set is labeled Euromedia Visin, whereas the Miss Marple DVDs are labeled Track Media. CAVEAT EMPTOR!! I shall be returning this set of Season 9 Poirot Blue Ray version to Amazon. In this case Amazon has left me VERY disappointed and receives one star for failing to state that this set is for European players. So where is the Track Media version for us Region 1 customers for this particular Blue Ray set of Poirot, Amazon????
Since I know the content of this set, I have rated the CONTENT with 5 stars. Poirot NEVER disappoints!",1376006400,5,887,4.584905660377358
5723157,1,B00CJ318FM,"I love David Suchet's Poirot. He is a masterful actor. My poor review has nothing to do with the content of the show but rather with the seller's mislabeling. The distributor of this particular DVD did not specify that this blue ray, despite being labeled as region A (north/south america) compatible, did not work on all region A players. I have contacted the distributor and asked them to please specify this important nuance in the future, as I have to now return the dvd. This is what I get for trying to save a few dollars on Amazon. I'm going to try ordering from the PBS online store instead.

5723160,3,B00CJ318FM,"My husband and I are huge Poirot fans, however this season is definitely the start of a change in this series.  There was gore and portrayals of murders as they were happening and sexually explicit and suggestive material.  In the past the focus has not so much been on the murder, but on the solving of it.  Murders were never shown as they happened, but Poirot was called out after they happened to solve them...no gore was seen.  Beginning with this season it seemed that the focus was on the evil aspect of the murder and the events that led up to them.  Also notable absent from this season are Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon.  I will not be purchasing this series anymore.",1486339200,5,679,4.479674796747967

5723189,5,B00CJ318FM,"Another excellent series with deviations from the original stories as written by Agatha Christie. The addition of a couple of suggested sex scenes in ""Death on the Nile"" and ""The Hollow"" were unnecessary and took away from an otherwise wholesome murder mystery.",1434585600,3,261,5.238095238095238

5723197,5,B00CJ318FM,"I think Poirot gets better with age, as if he wasn't already the best.  He speaks so much with his eyes and expression, he needn't speak a word.  This show is very well filmed and authentic.  David Suchet ""is"" Poirot!",1425168000,,217,4.375
5723198,4,B00CJ318FM,"Five Little Pigs--Christie rarely devoted ink to explaining her character's names, but in the case of Carolyn Crayle (aka Carla) she did explain that little Carla was named for her mother by her artist father.  Naturally, when in this film version the character is introduced as ""Lucy"" (a common a vulgar name) my jaw just dropped.  Another pointless change.  Then of course, the artist's name ""Amyus"" was mispronounced throughout.  Then there was the gratuitous homosexual angle, absent from the original story.  Setting these needless (and therefore, annoying) changes aside, this is one of the  better film adaptations of one of Christie's best stories -- another murder in retrospect.  Beautifully acted by the entire cast, with kudos to the incomparable Gemma Jones, this is a very good film.

Sad Cypress-- I literally cried at the end of this film, which is basically faithful to the original story, with a few changes that imho improved the storytelling (leaving out Mr. Gerard).  Solid performances and a story well told.  The musical score deserves mention here, as well.  This is one of Christie's most haunting stories and it is compellingly told here.  I never understood why Poirot was included in this story and apparently Agatha Christie herself regretted his inclusion.

Death on the Nile-- I would call this THE definitive version, but for one change (imho unnecessary) that was to me, a turd in the punchbowl.  (One of the dearest, most loved characters was portrayed as an incestuous hag, ugh, this affected what otherwise was a budding romance in the original story)  Otherwise, I like this version very much and this production compares well with the Ustinov version (Mia Farrow was a horrible choice for Jaqueline). Suchet's version is beautifully filmed, well acted and very moving.

The Hollow -  this is one of my least favorite Christie stories, but this film version is quite enjoyable.  It's a stupid story and I've never understood Henrietta's motives for acting as she did, but unfathomable story aside, the acting in this version should not be missed.  Sarah Miles and Edward Fox steal every scene they're in, making this a very fun viewing.",1424649600,3,2173,5.070422535211268

One thing I've sadly noticed on these later offerings is the insertion of bad language here and there, and some bedroom scenes that really aren't necessary.
Otherwise, David Suchet 's portrayal of Poirot is still so perfectly played, and once in awhile Capt. Hastings and Ms. Lemon even show up, adding to the sparkle and fun of these wonderful series.

5723229,5,B00CJ318FM,"I am hooked on the POIROT SERIES, starring David Suchet, and POIROT SERIES 9 does not disappoint.

Although some of the earlier releases on Blu-Ray had some noise and grain in certain scenes, particularly in darkly lit ones, SERIES 9 seems to have been shot with HD equipment, making the transfer to Blu-Ray pristine.

Not only is the acting top notch but the costuming, scenery, lighting and cinematography is breathtaking, not to mention the hairstyles! The show takes place in the early 1900s(?) and the details are exquisite. From the cars on the street to Poirot's outfits and accessories (he even has his own portable ashtray), nothing seems anachronistic. Next to the storylines and the acting, looking at the fashion is a must and it's another quality that makes this show such a pleasure to watch.

Anyway, the story DEATH ON THE NILE is slightly different than the 1978 movie version which starred Peter Ustinov as ""Poirot"" and featured an all-star cast. The subtle differences are the relationship between two characters, which have been changed, and Poirot isn't traveling with Colonel Race, but meets him aboard the ship.

Also in ""Death..."" character actress Frances De La Tour portrays ""Salome Otterbourne"" (Angela Lansbury's character in the 1978 movie), an alcoholic author, and steals every scene! I couldn't help but laugh out loud at her performance and wished she had more screen time.

Unfortunately this doesn't have any special features, which is a shame because I'm curious if they actually shot some of the scenes from ""Death..."" in Egypt or if it was a set.

The four mysteries in POIROT SERIES 9 work as stand-alone movies so you don't have to have seen any of the previous shows to get into them.

If you enjoy mysteries or like well made period films that take place at the beginning of the last century, especially fashion buffs, I would highly recommend not just Series 9, but all of the POIROT SERIES.",1403654400,,1934,4.896024464831804

5723232,4,B00CJ318FM,Poirot is getting older and they have written out Hastings in most of the shows.  A mistake in my view point.

But now we can rejoice!  Acorn has gone back to the original British masters, restored the widescreen image as it was produced, and the audio is uncensored.

8582362,5,B00CJ318FM,"After watching a few of the Poirot shows (David Suchet), I decided to buy all the series and start again from the beginning.  They are absolute great whodunits.  I've learned to really appreciate British detective shows and find so many of them great to watch.  So much more interesting than most of the run of the mill American shows that have been on TV lately.  Guess my age is showing.
I find this particular series very interesting because Agatha Christie has made these stories more complex than the earlier stories.  I still like the earlier stores but these are so much more interesting to watch.  I still think my all time favorite is still Murder On The Orient Express.  I've watched the old versions of this story and I'm waiting to see the new one but D. Suchets version of it is still my favorite.  Great stories from a great mystery writer.",1518825600,,854,4.572368421052632
