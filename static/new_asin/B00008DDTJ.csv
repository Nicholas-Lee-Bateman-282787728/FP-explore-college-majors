1835159,4,B00008DDTJ,"This is a great tape for people who have a real life and aren't expecting two day results.  When you work a hectic schedule and have kids the reality is you really can't always make time for long work outs.  I do mainly Abs & Stretch but on the days when I can do more the option is there, and it is segmented out in a great way.  This tape does produce results if you use it.  I know within a month of using it daily it worked for me.  It is a little retro but who cares if you get results.  It's a good workout at a good price!",1107993600,2,529,3.7636363636363637
1835160,1,B00008DDTJ,"this is a infomercial gimmicky type of workout...you can't work your body in the amount of time it suggests, you have to do so much more than that...these videos are lacking many things, like a fun leader, someone that isn't so goofy...plus, the quality is poor...and old....retro this to a garage sale.",1094688000,5,303,4.846153846153846
1835161,4,B00008DDTJ,"This program is great for the person who has a job, family, chores and all those things that come with reality.  Unlike the The Firm program and other exercise machines, it doesn't take a lot of time, corridation, money, or space.  I have been doing this fitness DVD video for several months now and have noticeable results.

The best part is you can pick and choose what you want to work on.  ANd you can do it based on time within your day.  My main goal was ABS.  After I got a good routine with the Abs I began adding and rotating between Arms, Buns, and Legs.  Now I do two 8min workouts and one of the bonus 20 minute workout 5 days a week. My favorite is the Basic Step Program.  It hits the main areas, easy to follow and it is only 20 minutes.

Great DVD at an exceptional value.",1090800000,72,788,4.131578947368421
1835189,5,B00008DDTJ,"This is my third copy of this, the first set being VHS tapes - They are good, efficient, quick exercise sets that work if you do them! They are very late 80's style but easy to watch and get used to and the best I have found which is why I keep buying them. I first changed to DVD which was nice to have all the sets on one DVD - then after about 8 years I broke that DVD while trying to clean it up and was so happy to find it was still available. Will be extra careful with my new DVD.",1379203200,,487,3.6923076923076925
1835190,5,B00008DDTJ,i had this years ago on VHS and lost it -- great workout program and reallly works IF you stick to it!,1363737600,,102,3.6818181818181817
1835191,5,B00008DDTJ,"Even though it is old, I love it because the instructor talkes you throught the whole work out and keeps you motivated. They do the exercises with you in real time and make it easy to stay caught up. Althought the arms and legs do not do much for me, because of my work, exercise, and lifting, the abs and buns still leave a person burning, but not exausted.",1363478400,,358,4.202898550724638
1835192,5,B00008DDTJ,"I bought this DVD to replace the old tape that I had of this fitness program.  It is a little dated (the workout clothes,lol) but is a great workout  program.",1358380800,,158,4.233333333333333
1835193,4,B00008DDTJ,"HEADS UP PEOPLE, this is a COPY of a COPY. Even though it is a Copy of a Copy it is still a pretty good copy, or I should say my copy is pretty good. My problem with it was that they didn't say that it was a copy.
Now about the program- it really does work, if you do it at lease 5 days of the week. It has different stages for you, so you can go at your own speed. I really like this program.",1344211200,,393,3.528735632183908
1835194,5,B00008DDTJ,"The DVD is an exact copy of the VHS workouts first issued in the mid-90's.  I loved 8-Minute Abs and Buns then and still find them fun and easy to do, and effective! It's great to have the addition of Arms and Legs.  It's a great way to add 8 or 16  minutes to a cardio workout.  As with other reviewers, I find that it's a pain to have to turn the DVD over to do all 4 workouts, it would be nice to have them in an easier-to-use sequence.",1324080000,,439,3.8444444444444446
1835195,5,B00008DDTJ,"I had these a long time ago when they were on tape and have them now as DVD's. Unfortunately, my little son scratched them and now I have to order more. They are hands down the best workouts out there each only 8 minutes long and each targeting different areas of the body. I can't say enough good about them. You'll definitely feel the burn. Used in conjunction with a cardio workout you won't need anything more (unless you want to body build). You can up the weights or use canned foods. It will sculpt your body and YOU CAN DO IT EVERY DAY IF YOU WANT.",1296864000,,556,4.205607476635514
1835196,4,B00008DDTJ,The :08 minute fitness tapes are great workout sessions.  You push yourself because you think you can always do just :08 minutes of any exercise.  The workout clothing worn by the instructors in this DVD are outdated and sometimes just plain comical to today's standards.  The exercises are still valid and do make your muscles sore the next day!,1296432000,,346,4.830508474576271
1835197,5,B00008DDTJ,"I am really pleased to find this DVD as I'd assumed that the 8-minute workouts would be VHS only.  I'd used the 8-minute programmes on video several years ago and, despite their dated appearance, found that they were fun to do and did help firm up the areas they focused on.....and, at only 8 minutes a time, I don't feel like I'm spending all my time working out even though, altogether, they add up to 30 minutes of targeted exercise.
There are all sorts of extracts of other workouts on the DVD.  I looked at them one time and, since then, I've ignored them since they all seem to be extremely cheesey and badly put together.",1288656000,,628,4.405172413793103
1835198,3,B00008DDTJ,"Enjoyed the VHS version, but needed a DVD version.  The DVD was just dubbed from the VHS, so the quality is bad, but it still fits the bill as an exercise video",1284681600,,160,4.0
1835218,5,B00008DDTJ,I got this years ago when it first came out and loved it then as much as now. I had it in VHS and only had the Abs and Arms. I haven't really used the Legs much but I do use the 8 min Stretch. It's great that it's all included in one disc. This is from the 90's so don't expect high tech video. But the exercises are timeless. This CD is a staple in my life and I always get results in about a week if I've slacked on it and pick it back up.,1279756800,,441,3.556701030927835
1835219,5,B00008DDTJ,"The workouts are only 8 minutes! I love that it includes workouts for every part of the body, 8 minutes each. It also as bonus includes a bunch of extra workouts like aerobics and kickboxing, great for burning calories and fat. (My favorite is kickboxing.)I've tried other videos but I didn't feel like they challenged me enough, this one is perfect for me, intensity wise, but it also gives you suggestions to do the workouts at lower intensity if you needed to. I like the instructor, he directs you well and doesn't get annoying like some do in other videos. So far it's my favorite video, great for busy people!",1271462400,,615,4.6
1835220,5,B00008DDTJ,I had owned a VHS tape of the 8 Minute Abs & Buns several years ago. I loaned it out and didn't get it back. I just wanted to own them again. This time I purchased the full exercise combination. I like the fast easy routines. They do work. I have been doing the exercises for several weeks now and feel much better.,1270512000,,315,4.015873015873016
1835221,5,B00008DDTJ,This is the best all around workout video out there.  They have a newer version that absolutely sucks.  This original one is hands down the best.  There are bonus videos as well that are awesome.  They stopped manufacturing it so you're going to have to spend extra cash for it if you can find it.,1255651200,2,297,4.345454545454546
1835222,5,B00008DDTJ,"I originally purchased this set for my VCR many years ago, I wore out the tape and was fortunate to buy it on DVD. It is a great workout.  Highly recommended",1237161600,,157,4.064516129032258
1835223,3,B00008DDTJ,"I got this thinking it had extra programs (maybe even bloopers).  After all, most anniversary editions contain extra content, that's why the price is so high.  But no, this is just the same old DVD, and you still have to flip the DVD over to do all the workouts (there is really not alot of video here, so I don't know why they can't put it on one side). If you can find the original DVD, get that, it's the same thing.

I gave this 3 stars because of the high price and no new content.  The workouts get 5 stars.  I did the buns workout as a joke, and when I was done I felt like I ran 10 miles (and sweated like it too), from then on I was hooked.  The arms workout is the best, get any fitness book and they will have you doing the same thing.  Of course, the famous abs workout is a killer, but when your done, you feel satisfied in completing something. The legs workout, well, not so great, it's difficult to work isometrics with the legs, since they are so strong.

Overall, if this is the only DVD you can find, get it.  But look around first.",1216512000,5,1051,4.063106796116505
1835224,5,B00008DDTJ,Arrived in great condition.  I use this video series and can attest to its' effective results.  These workouts really do work!,1198281600,,126,4.9523809523809526
1835225,5,B00008DDTJ,"although i loved the thought that i could do my workouts in about 8 minutes, it's not the only thing you can do to lose weight or get toned.  It is very 80's, but kind of funny and makes you giggle while you're doing it, and hey, that takes stomach muscles, right?  Overall good product to do on the fly.",1192579200,,304,4.05
1835226,4,B00008DDTJ,"This is very convenient in that you can do it in your own home.  If you don't have access to a local gym or weight machines, I would highly recommend this dvd.",1182816000,,159,3.96875
1835227,5,B00008DDTJ,"So easy to follow and quick. There are no more excuses for not toning up. You'll feel the burn and soreness to prove it works. Results in no time!

I LOVE this system!",1181088000,,167,4.0606060606060606
1835238,5,B00008DDTJ,"With a family, a job, and a busy schedule. I found that even on days that I had planned to work out didn't often happen the way I wanted!  With all of the 8 minute workouts, even I can find time to do one or two of these almost every day.  Since the workouts come in small increments, I find that I can do one workout and come back for another later.  The AB workout is challenging and I have even gotten my husband to do this one on occasion.  And I LOVE Gilad's 15 minute cardio blast!  Enjoy!",1171065600,,495,3.95959595959596
1835239,4,B00008DDTJ,"I was skeptical and it was cheap so  I bought it  with optimism.  The music is horrible and cheesy.  Conversely, the work out is great, effective and quick.  Great to do in the morning  before work.  Just be sure to mute  the video and turn up  your tunes!  I higly recommend this especially for getting  back into the ab routine :)",1170720000,,332,4.278688524590164
1835240,5,B00008DDTJ,"My sister had this DVD (that I borrowed constantly), so I had to buy my own copy. I basically use this dvd for the ab  workout (sometimes stretch and occasionally arms/legs). It is the best I have ever done! The first few times you use it are challenging (depending on how in shape you are), but you quickly adjust. Also, as you get in better shape, you are able to work harder within each 40 second movement, so you only better your workout as you go. I have been using it every day for about a month, and now most of my jeans are too loose in the waist.

The video looks a little outdated, but  the old-school leotards and lingo only add to the greatness that is this workout video.",1163548800,4,684,4.206106870229007
1835241,5,B00008DDTJ,"i HAD THIS PRODUCT ON VHS, MY FRIEND LOOKED IT UP FPR ME AND FOUND IT ON AMAZON.  I HAVE TURNED A FEW PEOPLE ONTO THIS VIDEO.  IF YOU WANT FAST RESULTS, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!!!! I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT FOR YEARS, THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TONING WORKOUT THERE IS ON THE MARKET:)

1835242,4,B00008DDTJ,This workout dvd is perfect for a person new to exercising or someone who has limited mobility. I fall into the second catergory. I have used this dvd for a month now and have lost 3 inches from my waist. My clothes are looser. I highly recommend this dvd.,1153785600,2,256,4.244897959183674
1835243,5,B00008DDTJ,I love this dvd my high school daughter and friends do this in gym all the time it is the best for those on the go!,1152835200,,115,3.4615384615384617
1835244,5,B00008DDTJ,"I wanted a strength training workout that involved just that without the frills of a warm up or lots of instructions, that is what I got here.  The ab and arm segments are my favorite (but that is why I bought it).  Though the attire is very 80's I found it more amusing than annoying.  I also like that there is a time meter so you know exactly where you are in the workout and how much is left. I definitely recommend it and would buy more if I could ever figure out how the other ones are any different (if at all).",1152835200,,518,4.009708737864078
1835245,5,B00008DDTJ,"This is a great DVD!  I like all of the additional footage you get with it.  My favorite is the abs and the stretching.  My husband and I do the abs almost everyday.

The only draw back is the dated wardrobe and music.  It's not that big of an annoyance.

I bought this for abs, I don't use the arms, legs or buns.  I have watched all of the exercises, they look like good workouts.  I lift weights but needed help with good ab exercises.",1152057600,,438,4.070588235294117
1835246,4,B00008DDTJ,"I already enjoyed these workouts regularly on VHS tapes, and had purchased the CD version for my parents a while back.  When I needed to replace my tapes, I saw this new ""anniversary edition"" and hoped that meant they finally put all 4 workouts on ONE side of the DVD.  (The set I got my parents is one DVD, but you have to turn it over for two of the 8-minute workouts.)  I figured since this new edition with a recent issue date was more expensive, SOMETHING had to be improved about it.  But it was the same as the cheaper version with two workouts on one side and two on the other.  The workouts are great, but their DVD technology is not.",1143331200,20,643,4.195121951219512
1835247,4,B00008DDTJ,"WOW! This one is so cheesy, I could eat it with crackers. Once you get past that, though, this is a great workout.  I like that its short, but intense. You can do just one or all of the sets.  I didn't like that the DVD is two-sided, but that's my only real complaint.  I really recomend this for anyone who doesn't always have alot of time (or, like me, motivation). It's quick, easy and I definately felt the 'burn'.",1143158400,11,418,4.2
1835308,5,B00008DDTJ,"When I first bought this dvd, I was very sceptical. Well I was definately wrong. I feel great! I have a 2 year old son and there is no way I can do workouts longer than 10 minutes without stopping. There are extra aerobics workouts in the dvd that are 5 to 20 minutes long for beginners or advance. I have been using this everyday and after a few weeks I could tell a big difference in the way I feel and look. You can choose which section of your body that you want to work on. And again it only takes 8 minutes long for each section of your body. I do a couple of sections in the morning, then a couple in the afternoon. I haven't gotten tired of using this dvd everyday yet. It's a real motivator. This product is definately a must for people like me who wants to start to get in shape and lose weight.",1142380800,14,805,4.0062111801242235
1835309,5,B00008DDTJ,Great and effective workout.  Easy to do.  You know you've worked out but you can still move afterward!,1141948800,4,103,4.666666666666667
1835310,5,B00008DDTJ,"This DVD is the best thing that's happened to me.  I am focused and more discipline with my workouts.  I actually look forward to exercising. It's 8 minutes for each body part and its quick, easy and effective.  I've been using it for three weeks and already see a difference. It's a very loaded DVD, and contains several cardio workouts as well. This one DVD will save you tons of money on buying fitness magazines, equipment, etc.  I absolutely love it.",1141776000,6,455,4.580246913580247
1835311,5,B00008DDTJ,This video is great! The workouts are really good despite being only 8 min long. There is even an 8 min stretching segment which is wonderful on its own. There are bonus workouts... including a fun Jamaican Workout (which I really enjoyed WATCHING and listening to the music!) But the other bonus videos are longer workouts and also a lot of fun. Recommended!,1140739200,5,359,4.714285714285714
1835312,3,B00008DDTJ,"The work outs on this DVD are great, but it is two-sided, so you constantly have to flip it over.",1140566400,2,97,3.9
1835313,1,B00008DDTJ,when the video was sent to me i was excited i put it in and it had nothing to do with abs only the rest of the body.... so im very un happy,1140134400,3,139,3.242424242424242
1835314,5,B00008DDTJ,"These tapes are perfect for seniors.  I am 76 years old.  I've neglected exercise the past few years but after a couple weeks of the stretches and exercises, I can do them with ease.  I can pick and choose and work on the areas of my body that, I feel, need it most. They probably wouldn't offer ""enough"" for the hardcore ...... but for me, it's perfect.",1140048000,3,354,4.253731343283582
1835315,5,B00008DDTJ,If You give 110% you will definetly feel the burn.  A great workout I use alone or usually with Cardio.  The music is like 80's porn.... but I just mute it and follow the timer at the bottom of the screen:),1139270400,3,206,4.0
1835316,5,B00008DDTJ,"Though these exercises are done in just 8 minutes, I've seen a difference, especially from ""Buns,"" in just three weeks of twice/week (my muscles needed three days recovery time at first).  The teacher leaves warm-up/cool down/stretch to you; include two to five minutes of stretch afterwards so you don't cramp.  Even so, you're done inside 15 minutes - easy to get in to your day.  Freely use the pause button until you can zip between exercises like he does.  Only flaw: the teacher babbbles the entire time and still under-emphasizes the importance of tight abs throughout every exercise.  Best thing besides the speed: the automatic counter.  You can do anything for 30 seconds!  You will see a difference.",1135728000,8,710,4.966101694915254
1835317,5,B00008DDTJ,"Ok, so the video itself is slighty cheesy and 80's themed. This is a great workout. It's fast paced so you don't get bored. And each workout is only 8 minutes so you always have time. It's easy to keep up with and in about 2 weeks i had the results i wanted.",1134604800,4,258,3.8867924528301887
1835348,5,B00008DDTJ,"I have all kinds of DVD, pilates/voga/exercise... but this is the ONE.  it really works.  you feel it within the first minute.  it even has the counter on the bottom of the screen + the level indicator on the right to show you the minutes and what step you are on.  GREAT

The only drawback is that it is not one continuous set.  you have to go through the menu motion, choose the set and push play.  the abs is on one side and the glutes are on the other.  you would have to stop the player, remove the disk and turn to the side you want.  minor inconvenience.

Overall, good dvd.",1134518400,7,581,4.107142857142857
1835349,5,B00008DDTJ,"The instructor is very 80's cheesy, but the workout is pretty intense, so it's pretty easy to tune him out. This workout will definately have you ""feelin' it"" the next day. I am an extremely lazy and undedicated person. Somehow, I don't mind doing this every day for 8 minutes. Sometimes I even do more than one of the workouts. They are all pretty intense. Good product for your money. You won't regret buying this.",1131321600,10,416,4.56
1835350,4,B00008DDTJ,"Let me start by saying I am NOT a fan of exercise videos.  Usually they're cheesy and after you watch them you realize you could have done the exercises on your own.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 8-Minute Fitness program was VERY instructional and REALLY gives you a good, intense yet brief workout.

I actually bought this for my wife and daughter, but I ended up doing it and I enjoy it more than they do!  You will definitely work your body without devoting a lot of time.  Too early to see any results yet, but it sure FEELS like it's doing the trick.

As in most workout videos, the leader is a little TOO perky and the program seems a little dated, but if you can overlook that, I would definitely recommend it.",1130198400,6,732,4.306569343065694

1835352,1,B00008DDTJ,I was looking for an exercise video with exercises targeted on the abs that didn't take a lot of time.  This has really met my need.  I can almost always fit 8 minutes into my schedule every day and it's not too boring.  Instructions are clear and no equipment is required.  The only drawback is that this is a double sided dvd and you have to eject and turn it over to do all 4 segments.,1126224000,3,388,4.065789473684211
1835353,4,B00008DDTJ,"I bought these looking for a workout I could do when there is no time to go to the gym.  This DVD set is perfect and a great price. Unlike other ones I've tried the music is not annoying and you don't need any special equipment. The time left in each workout is always counting down in the corner of the screen so you stick with it, and after all it's only eight minutes. You do feel you accomplished something when you're done. I recommended it to a friend who agreed it was better than other videos we had tried.",1123286400,3,514,4.14

This is an ""old"" DVD but it has all the basics needed to tone up and look great.  The addition of 8 minute stretch and the bonus workouts (although a little corny) are great too.  The timer in the lower right corner helps monitor time.  The time does fly by and you will feel the burn.  It is easy to get over the goofy outfits and cheesy dialogue.",1118534400,3,450,4.126436781609195
1835355,5,B00008DDTJ,"For a person who is constantly busy, this is perfect.  I am a stay at home mom and let me tell you it is hard going to the gym.  My husband is in the military and we are currently in england.  He is gone and I am at home by myself, therefore really no time at all to do much of anything, even cleaning is a chore.  So during my son's naps I take the 8-24 minutes to do my workout depending on what I want to do that day, after I am done I still have time to straighten up the house before I have a 2 year old all over me.  I use to do the firm but it just got old and took up too much of my time, this is perfect.  I really feel the burn and still do.  You can start off slow and work your way up.  I have been doing this for a week and I am hooked because I can at least get one workout in a day if not more.  Just awesome for the on the go person.",1114214400,7,849,3.4973262032085564

It's eight minutes of intense, targeted toning.  When you're doing them, it might not seem like it's working, but the next day, you will feel it.  You will have to do your own warmups and cooldowns.  My husband was pretty skeptical that these would work, but after seeing my results, he bought the DVD version.  I own many other fitness videos, but I always come back to the 8 Minute workout.",1111795200,11,537,4.267326732673268

But if you want to develop stamina, strength, tone up and lose those extra pounds, 8 minutes a day is the way to go.  Sure the video is dated 80's style ... but who cares, your working out right?

One tip for those doing the exercises (especially the abs), it is easy to cheat, so if you doing the workout and you don't feel the burn, try harder to isolate the muscle  and go slower, then you'll surely feel it!!

Best Wishes and Good Luck!!!",1109721600,22,585,4.281818181818182

7981617,5,B00008DDTJ,"An old school video (1994), but solid workout. Each exercise is done for about 45 seconds and the combination of exercises will total 8 minutes. The only equipment you need might be hand weights for the 'Arms' section (3-8 lbs. average but you can go higher) and a chair or dowel for stability in the legs section. All the moves are basic and easy to follow and done from a stationary position (mostly down on the mat).",1494633600,,419,4.454545454545454
