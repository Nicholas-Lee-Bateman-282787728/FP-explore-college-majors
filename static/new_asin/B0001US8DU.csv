2025173,4,B0001US8DU,"""Branded"" is my favorite Chuck Connors' series. While it isn't nearly as memorable as ""The Rifleman"" or even its follow-on series ""Cowboy in Africa,"" it's every bit as good.

Many of the episodes are in black and white, and sometimes the quality of the video sags. However, the storylines and acting is always first rate.

There are a number of guest-starring roles by actors and actresses who would later become better known in Hollywood. It's fun seeing younger versions of familiar faces.

The story centers on Army Captain Jason McCord. He is the lone survivor of a massacre at Bitter Creek. The Army brands him a coward and he is court-martialed. His being drummed out of the Army forms the title sequence that is one of the best of its kind. It also features a great theme song, which was later spoofed by ""Married With Children.""

Connors delivers some great performances as a tragic figure who is forced to prove himself everywhere he goes since he is branded as a coward. It's always great in the end how McCord redeems himself and moves on.

If you like old TV westerns, you will love these DVDs. They also feature a short biography of Connors and an episode of ""The Rifleman"" thrown in for good measure.",1142726400,7,1214,4.654205607476635
2025174,3,B0001US8DU,"What a shame.

The company that transfered these episodes to DVD should be ""Branded"" for doing such a poor job.

The sound is bodged into a strange 5.1 effect and on my DVD player the episodes show no run time or chapters (except bonus items which have a onscreen DOG (Digital Onscreen Graphic)).

Episodes seem cut and even a part of the end credits is cut from every episode (near credits end).

Bonus episode of Rifleman is cut badly at the point a chicken is killed.",1118880000,61,470,4.430232558139535

2025176,5,B0001US8DU,"I was overjoyed when I learned that this series was on dvd and I was not disappointed in getting it. This was a well written ,well acted honest show,one of the last to show the importance of character and principles and of putting duty and country before self. Connors plays a strong character who knows who he is and a coward or deserter  he is certainly not. A lesser man would have died of depression but Jason McCord  rebuilds his life and teaches a lot of lessons of manhood as he roams through the west

making himself useful and helping those in need.

My 7 and 9 year old boys have eojoyed watching it as well.",1105056000,11,618,4.301724137931035
2025177,1,B0001US8DU,"The shows have been edited by about 3-4 minutes each, these are the cut versions seen in syndication. Unacceptable. I wouldn't accept my paycheck missing 15-18% of my money, I'd be unhappy if I bought a book and found that 15% of the pages had been ripped out, so why should I pay $$$ for a DVD missing 15-18% of the footage? Avoid this set and spend your money elsewhere. The same company also released edited GUNS OF WILL SONNET shows, so buyer beware.",1104883200,130,454,4.416666666666667
2025178,1,B0001US8DU,"With the relative small number of western television programs available on DVD, I held great hope for this set. I had never heard of Marathon Music & Video (don't know why Amazon has it listed as released by ""On Deck""), but thought this purchase was a reasonable risk, as it IS the entire first season, and not just a packaging of some random episodes. Wrong. I guess I should have been smarter, based on the poor packaging.

The transfers are VHS quality. These are also edited versions of the episodes, as their total running time is only 22 minutes. Best guess would be that these are the syndicated versions of the program, rather than the original broadcasts.

Sound is on a par with the video, meaning, the volume control must be turned up, and hiss is ever present.

Worst of all, and basically salt in the wounds, is the appearance of that one item that is dreaded most by DVD collectors....the ""bug"" in the bottom right corner with an ""MM&V"" logo. There is no excuse for this on ANY release. This is why the consumer buys DVD's...to get away from this nuisance which has become the bane of cable television.

Oh well....another lesson learned. Add Marathon Movie & Video to the list of companies to avoid, along with Madacy, Platinum, Alpha Video, Vintage, and VCI.",1096416000,193,1274,4.648888888888889
2025179,5,B0001US8DU,I fondly remember this show as a kid and always wondered why it disappeared after 2 short seasons. Its much better than I remembered it being and I liked it a lot then!  Chuck Connors stars as Captain Jason McCord the sole survivor of an Indian massacre. He has been branded a coward and dismissed from the service. He must now make his way in the world finding a life and peace. It's clichied but he is of course innocent we're told though he is not always so certain  and it's his innocence is set up as a mirror to highlight the human frailty of those he comes across i his travels. Connor's work in it is excellent and the writing and production values were wonderful for its time. The transfer to DVD is a quality one but the company does note at the start that there is some problem with both the audio and video qualities at times. I found this to be only a minor distraction and should not deter you from buying the set. The price is is reasonable for 3 discs and the bonus episodes of Connor's in The Rifleman and The Four Star Theater were a nice touch as was the all too brief bio of Chuck Connors. I am hoping the company will release the entire season 2 episodes as well Connor's Arrest & Trial and Cowboy in Africa series. Connor's was truly a great actor and Branded will leave its mark in you.,1091836800,17,1309,4.232
2025180,5,B0001US8DU,"I have waited so long of this series,that i am overwhelmed by Joy. I have seen this series in the late sixties on German Television and it had since then no rerun. But in all this years it has some special memories in my mind. One of the best opening sequences of all time(Conners thrown out of the army etc.),a song and theme which is grand and i never forgot,Conners as big hero often beat by three or four guys,but never quit to get justice done,his horse an beautiful palomino(more a horse for an indian)and his special weapon his broken sabre. I remember some kind of sadness and lonleyness about the performance from Conners because of all the braveness he showed in every episode he must fight against his reputation as a coward. This series lasted only two season and was cancelled while conflicts with Conners and the studio cant be setteld. For me it is one of the finest western shows of all times,much underrated and better than the rifleman. The second season must have 32 Episodes and i hope it will published soon. After Have Gun Will travel this is the second western show with a full season on DVD.Maybe the studios are awakened and begin to realize that the kids who loved all the western shows of their youth are now adults with money in their pockets. Sorry ,before i buy one DVD of Smallville,Friends or Buffy i would buy tons of Gunsmoke,Bronco,Laramie etc. This set is for us who loves an old fashioned hero and a lot of gun and fistfights. I recommend this set highly. Buy it,for 25 Bucks it is an unbelievable great deal and it will give you the goosebumps. Believe me it worked for me!",1088812800,11,1611,4.501706484641638
2025181,5,B0001US8DU,"I disagree with a reviewer who basically criticized this TV western for being dated. To me, it's a fresh and original today as it was when it aired in 1965-1966.
The star, Chuck Connors (best known for his riveting portrayal of Lucas McCain in ""The Rifleman,"") gives an equally compelling performance here as Captain Jason McCord.
McCord, a West Point graduate, is the sole survivor of an Indian battle at Bitter Creek in the 1800s. Court-martialed as a coward who ran, he was forever ""branded"" with that stigma and thrown out of the Army, his rank insignia ripped off and his Cavalry sabre broken in two in a military ceremony casting him out of the fort. The humiliating scene was replayed as the opening clip of each episode as a moving western ballad ""Branded"" was sung over the images.
McCord, who is actually a man of deep conviction and principle, pleaded innocent but refused to testify in his own defense.  As the series progresses, we learn that he did so to protect the memory of the honorable General Reid whose eventual senility resulted in what actually occured at Bitter Creek, and also to protect a peace treaty with the Indians. McCord believes that if those politicians who did not want peace learned that General Reid, who had negotiated the treaty, was unfit, they would nullify the document and resume the Indian war.
Thus, McCord accepts his cruel label and fate, forced to live a nomadic life moving from survey job to job (a skill he learned in the military) because of the hatred people have for him. As far as the general public is concerned, McCord ran off to save his life, abandoning those under his command to all die at Bitter Creek.
Remarkably, the series is able to explore in a sophisticated manner the true meaning of bravery and right and wrong as McCord seeks to help those in trouble whom he encounters. Everyone who deals with McCord ends up understanding that the coward's label pinned on him is far from correct, and that he is a man of grit, bravery and honor.
In some ways, the themes of this series are similar to those explored in Kung Fu almost a decade later: lessons of morality, spirituality, honesty, bravery and the fundamental meaning of right and wrong and personal responsibility presented through the accessible medium of a western.
This show's unforgettable ballad, music by Dominic Frontiere, lyrics by Alan Alch, entones in part: ""All but one man died there at Bitter Creek, and they say he ran away... Not a single charge was true... Branded, marked with a coward's shame, what do you do when you're branded, will you fight to clear your name?""
Sixteen of the 48 half-hour episodes produced are released in this three-disc set. I hope the others are forthcoming.",1082332800,31,2721,4.7405063291139244
2025182,4,B0001US8DU,"This is a nice collection. A good western from the sixties starring Chuck Connors. As far as quality goes...it's good, but not as good as some. It's very watchable and very worth the price. Watching it makes you feel more like you're watching an old 50's tv show and not from 1965, that's the reason I give it only four stars. It's 3 disc and has 3 special extras, one on each disc. It's a Marathon Music and Video release by KingWorld. For those of you that love old tv westerns, this DVD set is for you. This is a show that's not seen much anymore and I was surprised to see it out on DVD. It's black and white with some color episodes.

""Survival"" is the pilot with guest Alex Cord and ""The Vindicated"" the second episode which shows what led to Jason McCord being thrown out of the Army, with Claude Akins and pre-""Lost in Space"" June Lockhart. The color three-parter ""The Mission"" has McCord leading a staged assault on a fort by renegades, featuring special guest star, recently-deceased Peter Breck of ABC's ""The Big Valley"" (in its first season that same year) as a renegade Mexican.
The bonuses include a brief documentary about Chuck Connors and an episode of ""Frontier,"" an obscure 50s western-anthology series produced by future ""I Spy"" creators Morton Fine and David Friedkin,
""The Assassin,"" with Chuck as a killer for hire. John Hoyt co-sters as a lawman; he would later appear in a ""Rifleman"" episode with Dennis Hopper.

2025198,3,B0001US8DU,"Chuck Connors had great success, starring in The Rifleman, from 1958 through1963.  The athletic Connors returned to television in Branded (1965).  The series follows the adventures of disgraced West Point army Captain Jason McCord, notorious for being a coward.  The series opens with McCord ceremoniously being stripped of his rank, his saber broken, and then being kicked out an army fort.  A basic explanation is provided by the series theme song, which describes how McCord the only survivor of a massacre at Bitter Creek, is wrongfully believed to have run away and let his comrades perish.

In the second episode of the series, `The Vindicators`, some of the mystery surrounding the events at Bitter Creek are clarified, but interestingly McCord himself does not know what the exact truth is.  General James Reed, the commander of the unit, was mentally incompetent.  McCord as the second in command, attempted to relieve the general of command, order a withdraw, and prevent a massacre by the Apache.  During the battle, McCord mysteriously blacked out, awakening to find that and everyone else in the unit has been killed.  In the aftermath, rather than have his friend the General's reputation suffer, and risk the peace with the Indians, McCord offers no defense at his court martial.

Becoming a drifter, rarely working a steady job, McCord travels from place to place, his past inevitably comes up again and again, often being a catalyst for trouble.  Although he does not have a tricked out weapon like Lucas McCain's Winchester, McCord is very skilled with a gun, and has no problems using one when necessary.  He has a bit of a temper, from constantly being harassed about his past, and at times strikes back with real venom.  And Chuck Connors has one mean, scary stare.  Created by Larry Cohen (Phone Booth, Q), the theme of an honorable man's struggle against prejudice and injustice is explored in an interesting variety of ways, usually without getting overdramatic or heavy-handed.

There is a nice cross-section of guest stars from the period.  Johnny Crawford, who was also in The Rifleman, guests in the episode, 'The Coward Steps Aside'.  The gifted actress June Lockhart, and Claude Akins appear in 'The Vindicators'.  Tommy Sands plays a West Point cadet looking to find the truth about Bitter Creek in 'That the Brave Endure', and Chad Everett has a dual role in 'The First Kill'.

Branded debuted midseason, in January of 1965, so there are just 16 episodes in the first season.  They are in black and white, except for the three part adventure, 'The Mission'.  Image quality is a little faded at times, but the source material appears to be pretty clean, and still looks quite good for the most part.  There are some bonus materials, including an episode of the Rifleman, an episode of Four Star Playhouse featuring Chuck Connors in a supporting role, and a short Chuck Connors biography.  Dominic Frontiere provided the music for the series, and some of the themes used in Branded, were also featured in The Rat Patrol.  Although the first season was abbreviated, the program was popular enough to be renewed for a second full season.",1257033600,2,3165,4.9620493358633775

By contrast (and way more worth the $ in my view),""Rawhide"" is avaviable on DVD and that shows picture & sound quality are great, it has production notes for each episode and it even has closed caption--I own season 1 & 2 and they are a far better choice than 'Branded'.",1217721600,9,722,4.2700729927007295

2025205,4,B0001US8DU,"The character of Jason McCord is the loneliest man on earth. Earlier in life McCord was a U.S. Cavalry Captain in the post Civil War era. McCord is the lone survivor of a battle against Indians. Since he is the only survivor, everyone assumes he must have run away rather than fight to the finish. You'll have to watch the show to actually figure out what happened during the Battle of Bitter Creek.

Since McCord has been dishonorably discharged from the Army, he now roams the Wild West with his broken saber and tarnished name. Every where he goes, people immediately recognize the name Jason McCord as the coward who abandoned his comrades at Bitter Creek. At the sight of McCord, children mock him, men stare at him in disgust, and women turn their heads in shame. McCord copes with the constant humiliation with dignity and patience. McCord is constantly tormented by his past. Nothing can be worse for a brave and honorable man than to be viewed as coward who is worse than a criminal. There is always some unsavory character who tries to exploit the negative stereotype of McCord in order to further his own unscrupulous plans. The townspeople are caught in the middle and must try to determine who is the lesser of two evils. In the end McCord always prevails and leaves the town winning new hearts and minds.

The first season is actually half a season with only 16 episodes. The first series aired from January of 1965 to May of 1965. The show did pretty well by finishing number 14 in the ratings. The quality of the video and audio are not that great. The acting is pretty good and the shooting locations look authentic. I wouldn't say the show is as good as Gunsmoke but it is definitely worth buying. Since Gunsmoke is a 5 star show, I can only give Branded 4 stars. I would buy it while it is available. Once it's gone, it will probably be gone for good.",1212364800,3,1870,4.513274336283186

Chuck conners was better in this,Then in the other series the rifle man, but also great. I really enjoyed spending some time with old friends,and you will too.",1181952000,,262,4.36734693877551
2025211,4,B0001US8DU,"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I was very pleased with this DVD set.  There were no logo ""bugs"" at the bottom of the screen on any of the episodes, and I was pleased with the sound and picture quality.  Not as prestine and clear as some DVD sets, but very good quality for a show that has set on the shelf for so long.  The episodes are edited down to 22 minutes, which is disappointing, but not a huge deterrent.  After all, where else are you going to see this show?  It hasn't been on TV in syndication in over 20 years.  Edited episodes are better than no episodes at all.  If you have fond memories of this show or are wanting to check it out for the first time, I would highly recommend it.",1171929600,4,706,4.109489051094891
2025212,5,B0001US8DU,"Branded is truly an outstanding western series. Chuck Connors as Jason McCord is every bit as good as he was as Lucas McCain in The Rifleman. If you like western drama this is the set for you. It is well written, directed and produced. My husband and I really enjoyed this set. Too bad there aren't programs on TV like this one today.
