8213026,4,B000UDUMXW,"I liked it very much. For any horse racing enthusiast, I recommend it highly. The career of The Tin Man is touched on, but this documentary was filmed before his amazing come back and stellar racing performances.",1375228800,,212,4.756756756756757

8213029,5,B000UDUMXW,"This DVD was just what I'd hoped it would be.  I loved watching the races and was especially impressed with the individual care each horse was given during its training for the track, as well as the medical observations and treatments provided to ensure the horses remained healthy and sound. This is a documentary I will watch many times and would recommend it to anyone interested in Thoroughbred racing and what goes on daily in the life of trainers and horses.  Also, it arrived by the projected delivery date and was in excellent condition.  My thanks to those who made this DVD possible.",1329264000,,593,4.737864077669903

It shows the drama and disappointments on the backstretch, the care and attention that Mandella and his staff lavish on their equine stars. On The Muscle is a must see for anyone interested in the thoroughbred racing, it's brilliant.",1223164800,13,376,4.8
8213031,5,B000UDUMXW,"In this unprecedented exploration of a world-class Thoroughbred trainer and the runners in his barn, the ending could not have been written any better in Hollywood.

Though the focus is on the 2002 racing season and Breeders' Cup of trainer Richard Mandella, the 3-hour documentary reaches the finish-wire at the 2003 Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita Park, where he won a remarkable four races.

The DVD is split into a trio of one-hour segments, with the focus on three runners - Redattore, The Tin Man, Pleasantly Perfect - with other equine athletes - Kudos, Cagney, Ile de France, Brisquette, Listen Indy - being highlighted through their morning workouts and afternoon races.

Unless you are on the backside every day, or an assistant to a top trainer, there will never be an opportunity to truly get this close to the long hours and oftentimes frustrating work that goes into the shaping of a champion.

Fans see the end result on the track; now they can view the rough road that leads from the barn to the starting gate.",1203811200,29,1023,4.762711864406779
