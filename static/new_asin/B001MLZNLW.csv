3698045,2,B001MLZNLW,"I purchased this DVD set new from a third-party seller to discover the feature ""Guarding Tess"" only plays as fullscreen even though the outside of the DVD case clearly indicates 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen for each of the two features. The feature ""It Could Happen To You"" played as widescreen. To be sure this was not a 'hiccup' in packaging I purchased a second DVD set new from another third-party seller with the exact same result. Sony Pictures has blatantly misrepresented the feature ""Guarding Tess"" as widescreen and you only get the fullscreen version.
If you are looking for the widescreen version of ""Guarding Tess"" then DO NOT BUY this DVD set because all you will get is a fullscreen version.",1278201600,17,706,4.891666666666667

3698077,4,B001MLZNLW,Guarding Tess is an excellent film about relationships.  It Could Happen to You was kind of sappy.  I was hoping It Could Happen to You would capture my imagination about winning the lottery.,1431820800,,191,4.757575757575758

3698087,3,B001MLZNLW,"Both movies are fun Cage movies where he plays the long suffering ""Mr Nice Guy"" who has his ups and downs as he pokes along with his job (secret service protector to ex-Presidents' widow in ""Guarding Tess"" and beat cop in ""It Could Happen to You"").  OK for the whole family, though there is some violence in ""Guarding Tess"" that could disturb youngsters.",1390435200,,354,4.619047619047619
3698088,4,B001MLZNLW,both are Nickolas Cage Movies that are not Marine Hero type...both are testing the resolve with compassion.  They are a lesson in integrity and gaining and losing.  It is like a lot of my movies; one that shows a person learning there is more than meets the eye.  All the characters experience something they had not expected in values.,1370390400,,336,4.661016949152542
3698089,2,B001MLZNLW,"I ordered JUSY Guarding Tess, BUT when it arrived it was 2 pictures one one disc.

I noticed several shoots which had been left out, it did not make it the same movie I had enjoyed and wanted to see ..when I reported this NOTHING was done, there wasn't even an answer to my note.  Thanks a lot!  How would you have felt?

I was not interested, did not want the other movie and I had ordered one with JUST the ""Guarding Tess"" film on it.",1362873600,5,436,4.034883720930233
