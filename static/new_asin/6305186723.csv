977831,5,6305186723,"...Oh, Boy. Quantum Leap on DVD.
August 22, 2002

The floodgates are open. Releasing television series on home video was completely unpractical six years ago, but the convenience of DVD has showed studios that fans will buy up television programming on DVD. As many television shows have been announced over the last month or so, it appears that a great deal more are coming. Universal Studios Home Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Warner Brothers Home Video and Paramount Home Entertainment have all recently announced commitment to television on DVD. One of the first new series coming from this announcement is the science fiction drama Quantum Leap due in 2003.
Before Scott Bacula traveled through space as the captain of the Enterprise, he traveled through time as Sam Beckett, a scientist who discovered the ability to leap through time, from person to person, within his own lifetime. Along with his friend Al, who appeared to Sam as a hologram from the future, Sam used the ability not for personal gain, but to help fix other's lives which had gone astray. Although the pilot of this series is out there on a discontinued DVD, it looks like the rest of the series will follow. Although no information is available on prices, specs, or features. Information on the show and likely many other popular series will be coming down the pipeline soon.",1032739200,22,1378,4.991304347826087
977832,4,6305186723,"I loved Quantum Leap when it was on terrestrial TV and unfortunately I do not have satellite to watch re-runs on UK Gold. We've got Buffy box sets, Angel box sets, Friends box sets, even Red Dwarf box sets and all of them pale in comparison to the excellent writing and production of Quantum Leap.
It was a well thought out, interesting and funny programme which could also be moving and thought provoking. Please please please, can we have the different seasons released as box sets on DVD as I'm sure there are many like me who agree!",1031356800,22,536,4.479591836734694
977833,1,6305186723,"I love Quanrtum Leap. No, I mean I LOVE Quantum Leap. But this DVD had zero extras, a cheesy menu board with chapter selection only, and the menu didn't even use the real Quantum Leap logo. It's like they didn't know what Quantum Leap was when they put the movie on the DVD. Overall, a poor DVD.
Advise to producers...put the whole series on DVD and take the time to put extras and gooodies on them with menus that match the shows atmosphere, just as all good DVD's do.
Leaping out...

977834,2,6305186723,"This is a great episode, but I wouldn't buy any of these until they start releasing entire seasons.",1008201600,21,99,4.555555555555555
977835,5,6305186723,"I used to watch Quantum Leap when I was younger and loved it.  I still do and thats why I bought the DVD.
I live in the UK and they didn't release the DVD and now it is out of print, so, I bought it off the collectible section.  (Good job I have a multi-region DVD player.)
Quantum Leap is one of the most original sci-fi/comedy/drama series of all time.  It is a classic and is a must see.
Now that Scott Bakula is in Star Trek: Enterprise I think they may start doing Quantum Leap on DVD again, makes sense really.  Lets keep our fingers crossed.
Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell play their parts well and are one of the best acting duos of all time.",999216000,8,651,4.102362204724409
977836,5,6305186723,If only ALL the episodes were this good. Great film making for a TV show may I add. I would love to see more of the Project where Sam created Quantum Leap though.,989625600,2,162,3.9393939393939394
977837,5,6305186723,"Quantum Leap is a real jem.  With an intriguing story that pulled the audience in week after week, it was considered one of the most innovative show of its time, and it still is.
The pilot presents the genesis of the show, having Sam, the main character, forgetting (almost) completely who he is, where and when he's from and how he got in into the 1950's.  The only thing he does know is that he does not belong where he is.  During the show, Sam gradually learns more about himself and the project he was working on.
Quote from Sam, as he realize his predicament: ""Okay, it's not a dream.  It's a nightmare.  And if it's a nightmare, then sooner or later, there's going to be a Boogeyman!""  Then enter the Boogeyman, or Albert (""Al""), the observer from his own time...
What is remarkable about this television series is that the emphasis is on the personal and social interactions between Sam, Al, and the people around them, not on the science-fiction element of the show.  No techno-babble.  Not many special effects.  Also, the chemistry between Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell is something to be seen.
Sam is presented as quite vulnerable, not the typical lone hero with an attitude.  Sam is acted as an ordinary man (relatively speaking, as Sam has six doctorates) stuck in an extraordinary situation.  Al is the sidekick, and comic relief of the show.
The pilot actually presents two ""leaps"": one into a test pilot, the other, shorter, into a baseball player.  I do not want to spoil too much the ending, but this episode does end with the typical cliffhanger, leaping into another person, in another time, and into an awkward situation...
The DVD itself is plain vanilla.  The only enhancement is a menu driven scene selection.  No trailer or language options.  No special features.
But aside from that, Quantum Leap is truly a classic in any media.",985737600,16,1858,4.708978328173375
977838,5,6305186723,"I've been a fan of Quantum Leap since it was aired on TV.  As a fan, I watched it on TV and when they finally decided to put it on laserdisc, I started buying them all.  I was disappointed when they stopped creating  them after only less than half a dozen laserdiscs. I felt somewhat angry,  cheated, and short-changed.  Now again, I will start buying the DVDs and  hope that the powers-that-be will continue producing DVDs and COMPLETE the  series.  Wonderful thought-out shows.  If you've ever wanted a sci-fi show  with some feeling and thought put into it...you won't be disappointed with  this......",947289600,10,604,4.766990291262136
977839,4,6305186723,"This is an excellent transfer of the pilot episode of the brilliant TV series Quantum Leap. Now if only there was a way to get past all the copyright problems and release the entire series on DVD.
The pilot  introduces us to Sam Beckett, a scientist who steps in the Quantum Leap  Accelerator in 1995 and awakens in 1956. Unfortunately something has gone  wrong, his memory is patchy - at first he can barely remember who he is.  Finding himself in the body of a USAF test pilot about to make an attempt  to break the Mach 3 barrier in an experimental plane, Sam must ensure the  survival of the pilot in addition to trying to restore his memory and  hopefully return to his own time. Helping him out is an holographic image  of his colleague, Al, who can only give him minute snippets of advice in  the hope of sorting things out in both 1956 and 1995.",922752000,13,853,4.348101265822785

7884492,5,6305186723,"I must say the pilot episode was a must see. I think it may be one of my favorites really, its one of the only times we get to see where Sam came from. What time and such, now I saw a remark on here about Seasons 4 & 5 I wanted to respond to this. As we know Season 4 is on order here at Amazon. Due out March 28th of next year. Season 5 I'd wonder if that season may come out this summer? Kinda wonderin on that. Any thoughts?",1135728000,,427,3.652173913043478
7884493,5,6305186723,"I loved Quantum Leap when it was airing. I am so glad that it is on DVD now. I did't buy this DVD, But I did buy season 1, 2, & 3. This episode is on Season 1. Its just as good as I remembered. Now I just want to know when Season 4 & 5 come out.",1117497600,2,245,3.2413793103448274
7884494,4,6305186723,"Sam Beckett is having a slight memory problem.  He can't remember who he is or what he does.  He just knows that the body he's in isn't his own.  Heck, he's supposed to be a test pilot who doesn't know the first thing about flying.  And the year 1956 feels wrong as well.

To further prove he's going crazy, a man keeps appearing that only Sam can see.  Al clams to be a friend and co-worker and has a crazy theory about time travel.  In reality, it might just be crazy enough to be true.  If it is, how can Sam get out of this body and back into his own?

I've caught a few episodes of this show in reruns over the years but never with any consistency.  I was looking forward to seeing the pilot since I never had.  Unfortunately, it falls into the camp of many television pilots.  Most pilots are important for setting up the situation and relationships the main characters find themselves in, but are slow once you know the full story.  The main plot of this episode is Sam trying to figure out what is happening to him.  Since I already knew that, there were times I found my interest wandering.

Fan of Quantum Leap will be happy to know this episode is also included in the Complete First Season DVD set, so they don't need to purchase it separately to complete their collection.

If you're new to the show, this is the perfect place to start.  It's a good first episode even if it doesn't hold up as well to repeat viewings.",1117411200,,1431,4.260223048327138
7884495,5,6305186723,"There is no need to buy this dvd.  The pilot, genesis, is included in the Season One DVD which just came out.  They don't write smart tv shows like Quantum Leap anymore.  If they did, you'd probably see something like this on HBO.  Each episode is more like a movie than a tv show.",1087516800,37,281,4.148148148148148
7884496,5,6305186723,"According to Project Quantum Leap, they called Deborah Pratt and asked about the QL DVDs... aparently, Universal is already working in these DVDs, so, probably they would see the light of day in 2004 (maybe the first quarter).",1069977600,4,226,4.973684210526316
7884497,5,6305186723,"Yes, the show itself is about time: time to see life as others see it. The DVD shows it's about time to get the entire series available to the public!
In an age where TV shows are chopped up in syndication, it appears that DVDs are the last bastions of creativity. On one of these you can see an ENTIRE episode, start to finish, as it originally aired and before it has been shredded to fit into the secondary media.
IT IS ABOUT TIME TO HAVE ALL THE EPISODES RELEASED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. The show itself was excellent (as attested to by all the critical and fan acclaim) and the interest in it is once again gaining strength. It would be wonderful if the DVDs would have more than a mere episode but lack of more should not be an excuse not to release them.
Time is marching on. Let's get these episodes OUT THERE!",1059004800,4,817,4.243589743589744
7884498,5,6305186723,"Quantum Leap ran from 1989-1993 for 97 episodes. I loved this show! It was amazing. I was almost crying when it ended. ""THEY CAN'T LEAVE IT THERE!"", I shouted. It is kind of sentimental and honest at the same time. Everything from the theme music to the inventiveness and unpredictabilty of it all makes it a truly classic show. It always had a way of making you well up with tears or long for the 'good old days'. I hope they make a movie of it some day. If they do it'll be a box office smash. Universal have promised us that they will release season box sets of the show some time in 2003 so until then all you fans will have get your fix from this.
The pilot episode (or Genesis) is the perfect introduction for non-fans. Okay, so it may be slightly cheesy and the use of stock footage is a bit cheap but as the shows went on the budget got higher and there was more opportunity for elaborate effects and storylines. And who can forget that awesome theme tune?
Sam and Al's partnership is truly great and it's a shame this is not on TV anymore. But the Season Sets will be out soon and let us hope they have more features than this disc (none-Main Menu is chapter select!). This DVD is in fullscreen as filmed and is in Dolby Stereo.",1041638400,5,1237,4.223628691983122
