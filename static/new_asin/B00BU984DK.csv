5673728,5,B00BU984DK,"I had the privilege to see this documentary in a theater recently.  We took a 93 year old WWII Veteran with us.  It was an amazing and moving experience.
The documentary is about a community that comes together to take World War II Veterans to see the Memorial in Washington DC, at no cost to them.  It was a project that took on a life of its own and so many were able to go.
I lost my father over 25 years ago.  He and his brother served together.  He never talked about the war.  This documentary tells us that the soldiers ""came home from the war, put their duffle bags in the basement and went out and got jobs.""  Most of them never talked about their experiences and now we are losing those Veterans at the rate of over 900 per day, and their stories and experiences are going with them.  This documentary got the Veterans to open up and talk about it, many for the first time.
We have the freedom we have today because of them, and we need to hear their stories.
On our drive home, the gentleman with us started talking about the documentary, and then some of his experiences in the Navy.
I have just pre-ordered this documentary, and I plan to show it to all my family and friends.
I hope that each and every Veteran has the opportunity to go to Washington DC and visit their Memorial.  They earned it.
I hope that Honor Flight is an organization that continues to take these Veterans, and doesn't end with the Veterans in this one community.",1363737600,66,1450,4.301470588235294

5673750,5,B00BU984DK,". . . this film had me in tears!

I live in the Milwaukee, WI area, so I was familiar with the entire ""Honor Flight"" project.  My wife and I and one of my daughters participated in a ""homecoming"" celebration at the local airport -- and even the film did not do that experience justice.

This is the greatest honor to Our Greatest Generation that I can think of.  We screened this film at my church -- and one of the viewers was a participant in the actual Honor Flight displayed in the movie!

I have already given three copies of this movie as gifts.

5673763,5,B00BU984DK,"This movie is a very heart warming look at the heroes from WWII and Korean war that gave us the freedom that we have today. Every person young and old should see this movie. 1000 survivors from this horrible war die each day and soon they will be gone forever. Many never talked about their experiences or told the stories of the war. Soon this history will be lost forever and many of the veterans never got the ""Welcome Home"" they so greatly deserved. My father was one of those great men.

I have been given the honor of being a volunteer photographer on a upcoming flight and I am going to do my best to honor these brave men and women who gave their all. After seeing this movie I am moved to be a better person and appreciate the freedom and rights we have in America even more than before.

5673932,5,B00BU984DK,"Typically my reviews are lengthy, but after seeing ""Honor Flight"" I realize that I have so little say compared to the words from the World War Two veterans showcased here. This is an absolute must see and truly encapsulates the sacrifices of America's greatest generation like nothing I can recall. Like most of the community members who became involved in Honor Flight I too had relatives serve in the war and come from a family of proud veterans; all the World War Two veterans I have ever met have been uniformly hardworking, honest, and modest, none remotely thinking of themselves as heroes, but nothing could be further from the truth. These men saved the world. It's as simple as that.

I want to thank the filmmakers for making such a genuinely moving documentary, and I want to thank Honor Flight for performing such a worthwhile mission. Most of all I want to thank the veterans of World War Two. Our nation owes you its freedom and I salute you.

""Honor Flight"" should be seen by everyone. Absolutely magnificent.",1403222400,,1024,4.747191011235955

So I bought a second one.  If you have any affiliation at all with World War II, it will make you cry.  It is SO touching... every American needs to see this!  It is about our World War 2 veterans being taken to see their World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.  They are all in their 80's and 90's - truly America's greatest generation and the veterans who literally saved the free world.  Not sure why this Memorial was built after the Korean and Vietnam Memorials - too bad many didn't live long enough to be so honored.  This is a GREAT tribute to those who remain.  You should definitely get this short movie.",1402185600,,794,4.275167785234899

This is an emotional, fast paced movie. As the grand daughter of a WW2 vet, I can fully understand and appreciate the sacrifices these men and women made. These vets are the most humble people, and I hope that teachers at our junior high, and high school levels will make this movie part of their curriculum. They cannot be forgotten or taken for granted.

I've talked to everyone I know who watched it and, not only were they impressed by this movie, but it has allowed them to begin discussions with relatives about their time served.

This is an unbelievable heartbreaking story, someone took the initiative to make sure the WWII veterans got to see THEIR memorial, some how, some way, and what a determined team they were. I could feel their anguish when they weren't sure if they could pull it off!! That said, here comes the fountain of tears; I cannot imagine what was going through the veterans minds when they approached this beautiful memorial, but I felt proud for them. There must have been a lot of hidden memories that came back to a lot of them, friends they lost, the things they saw, and killing an enemy. The video captures a lot of emotion, and the camera position make you fell like you were right there interviewing the veterans and people. Excellent video!!!",1377216000,,908,4.576687116564417

I do not think words can truly articulate how amazingly touching Honor Flight is. The concept of the movie is genius. You get to see the hard work that went in to making the Honor Flights possible, while also getting to know several veterans and hearing their war stories. These veterans all have stories that deserve to be heard. I don't think it's possible for one of them to have a boring story!
  You really fall in love with each of these heroes throughout the movie. I know that I, personally, have a much greater respect for my grandpa's service in World War II after this movie. It really helped me to see the true impact of their sacrifice. These men came home and went back to their normal lives even though they saw horrors that I cannot even fathom. They fought for our freedom and asked for nothing in return.  This movie should be required viewing in every high school across America. It just changes your outlook on life and makes you cherish the moments you are blessed with. My grandfather has always been my hero, and this movie has provided me with a much better understanding of just how much he went through to preserve our great nation's freedom.

Their stories and humility make you appreciate even more how much we owe our existence today to their sacrifices.

The movie brought back all the wonderful memories of an Honor Flight homecoming at Midway Airport in Chicago when my Uncle and his fellow vets were surprised at all the hoopla at the airport when they returned home after a very long day and delayed flight. Although he had lived 90 years by the time he went on that trip, my Uncle said it was one of the best memories of his life. Sadly, he passed away a few years later.

I've known a couple guys locally that have gone on honor flights. They were very moved, interestingly enough, not so much by the memorial itself, but by the actions of their friends and neighbors who wanted to see them able to make the trip. I see much of that in this film.

Even as a Vietnam veteran myself, the realities of these WWII vets far and away reach down into the moral fabric of who we are as Americans. When viewed as a whole, none of us lives trivial lives. Each day is a bonus day. My dad was a WWII veteran, having flown 65 combat missions over Germany in B-17's and he lived to come back home. I only wish Honor Flight would have been available for him to participate in. I am sure he would have opened up and been able to talk about his realities instead of keeping those stories hidden from all of us in his family. War experiences affect us all differently. I am glad I have had mine and truly appreciate what freedom truly means, I truly appreciate this story in that it opens us all up to our feelings, our loyalty for America, and our deep appreciation for all who stood in harm's way.

It brought back those memories of how my dad and mom lived, their hopes and dreams, and the pride my dad would have owned had he lived to participate in this honoring.

5674211,5,B00BU984DK,"When the WWII Memorial was built, I wondered why it took so long, As a Viet Nam vet, I new the Viet Nam Memorial was necessary mostly because the returning vets from that war, had few thanks for their time in service, and some were even blamed for the war, and spit on. Personally, the students who chanted the slogans, and the professors who felt so cleaver and powerful, and egged them on, I learned to pity for their inability to not only think beyond their teaching, but to even know there is an outside to the box. They were ALWAYS democrats... and still are. The WWII vets came back to a thankful country, and deserving  every bit, but I believe most of of them had many bad memories, and were caught between wanting to forget, and wanting to tell someone of the horrors of the war they fought. They got busy working, and with a work ethic never seen before, they made the American manufacturing machine the envy of the world. They married, had children, and forgot the war. As the importance of the war became lost in time, and the vets aged, and retired, there was a reflection off the Viet Nam Memorial that made the people realize that the country never built a memorial for the greatest generation. This movie does a beautiful job of following one group who started very small, but because of the Americans who could find a connection to the war, it grew and met the need.

From the receiving line of military personel to the military band to the motorcycle escort, the WWII vets were treated as the heroes they are.  Every person who came up to them made the statement""thank you for your service"" a phrase my father had never had spoken to him before that Saturday. My father, a veteran of both the D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach as well as the Battle of the Bulge and other battles was thrilled. The pilot made an announcement on the flight down about the vets, and we could hear the crack in his voice as he spoke about them. After we toured the WWII Memorial we went to the Marine Memorial at Iwo Jima. A young woman came up to my father and me to ask what the t-shirts we were wearing was all about.  When I explained it to her, first she asked if she could shake my father's hand and then said ""I have to give you a hug"".  This from a woman who was an Iraq war veteran.  She understood that even though she and the other Iraq and Afghanistan vets as well as the Korean War, Vietnam War and First Gulf War vets were and are doing a very important job, and have earned our respect and admiration, the WWII vets saved us all.

While he fought aboard the USS Patterson, my grandma waited for his return working in a bullet factory. He did return, scarred. But, went right to work building a farm and a family of 8 kids (which turned into 27 grandkids, some of whom he never got an opportunity to meet). My grandma gave as much as she was able to the WWII monument and I would love to take her out to see it. I would also love to serve as a Guardian for an Honor Flight from my state. I only found out after my grandpa passed, 20 years ago, that I was the only grandkid he shared dark war stories with (although I'm sure he carried many more with him to the grave). Of course, I was always asking him questions about his service, but every once in awhile his eyes would trail off and he would recall and describe memories that I can't shake to this day.

That is why I love this movie. Just knowing a tiny sliver of what my grandpa went through, I know that this is a very important and healing opportunity for this amazing group of soldiers. Thank you for dreaming big and creating Honor Flight!

I had the privilege of watching ""Honor Flight"" at its world premiere at Miller Park in Milwaukee in the Summer of 2012.  It will indeed bring a tear to your eye.

A great movie to be shared often.

About the only negative on this product is that the DVD is VERY bare bones.  You get the movie in either a 2.0 or 5.1 audio mix option and that is it.  No trailers, no behind the scenes, no featurette on the awesome world premiere at Miller Park, just the movie itself.

I live in Dallas and flew to Milwaukee to act as a ""guardian"" to my dad and another veteran.  This was an awesome trip for my dad and a fantastic experience for me.  My dad had never talked about his service in WWII, and neither had most of these veterans.  It was especially moving for me when, while waiting at the WWII memorial for the bus to pick us up for the next destination, a current member of the military and his young boys inquired whether they could ask my dad about his service.  In response, my dad went through his wallet for a picture showing the anti-aircraft guns he operated.  Never in my lifetime had I seen that picture!  Since my dad has passed, I carry that picture with me to remind me of him and the wonderful ""Honor Flight experience.""

5674241,5,B00BU984DK,"This is a must-see for all of you!  It particularly touched me, given my father served in the Pacific Theater during WWII, and he died the year before the WWII Memorial in Washington, DC was completed.  I am so thankful that the Honor Flight program, as so beautifully depicted in this movie, has given thousands of veterans an opportunity to travel to America's capital to see their memorial.  Far more than just looking at the memorial, though, are the interactions that occur before and during travel both to and from Washington, DC.  The music, the memories, even the mail call brought a delightful and warm  feeling to the hearts and minds of so many of our deserving veterans.

These soldiers came home from a war that had to be fought and won, and they didn't ask for anything. They quietly slipped back into civilian life, took jobs and raised families, and didn't expect any notoriety.  It is way past time that we give them the honor they deserve, in keeping America and much of the world free.

I spoke with a gentleman at my American Legion post who shared his Honor Flight experience, and the memories of his Honor Flight trip will stay with him until he dies.

Given the rapid rate at which we're losing WWII veterans, the program has in some places now been opened to veterans of the Korean Conflict.  Many have served since then, and so many American soldiers are serving their country now, not just in Afghanistan but around the world.  It is incumbent upon us to honor them for their sacrifices.

I recommend this movie for anyone and everyone!  It's wonderful to use in a classroom (I'd recommend junior high and older, right through college).  It would be a wonderful movie to show with a church group, a civic group, any type of philanthropic group.  It would be just plain heart-warming to share with friends in your home. The pre-sale copy I ordered has been viewed 6 times, and I have a feeling it will get much more usage as times goes by.

I'm hopeful that Honor Flight, the movie, will incite many of you to join an organization that supports our veterans, active military, and their families.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to those who keep us safe and free.

5674253,5,B00BU984DK,"Honor Flight movie was right on the mark. This generation came home from war and went to work to rebuild our country. They didn't boast. These veterans swallowed hard and never told their stories.  They were the product of parents who fought in WWI and had survived the depression. They knew adversity and knew in their hearts if they were going to succeed it would have to hard work, save a few dollars at a time, invest in family and invest in their communities.

This movie centers around a small town who has two humble men who fought and survived the bloodiest of battles, back when they were just boys.  It is a wonderful life story that has finally recognized the outstanding service of our greatest generation. It gave me goose bumps and I shed many tears for all the men and women of WWII.

Honor Flight started with the idea of one person and has positively impacted so many. My 91 yr old Dad is fired up while he waits for his turn. His flip flops have not touched the sand since he saw the movie! It has helped him open up and tell me about friends he lost or were severely injured. He's talked about the rationing that was happening at home. That my mother worked in a bomb factory to support the troop effort. More stories are coming out. Recognition. The sweet sound of Thank You. Silently he wanted to see the Memorial in Washington DC but he never said anything to anyone. The Honor Flight trip will be the cake, ice cream, whipped cream and a cherry!  Keep this story going. Find each veteran who served. Let them know we love them for what they have done to keep us safe for all these years.",1368921600,,1610,4.37123745819398

I have to say its a ""4 Hankie"" film but so extremely moving. I wish it could be shown in every high school history classroom in the USA. Kudos to all who produced, directed, and volunteered in WI and throughout the country to make this film a reality. And to think that WI raised enough money to send THREE 747's to D. C.!  The best part is the powerful ending!  God Bless you and the United States of America!

Just got back from the ""Honor Flight, One Last Mission"" premiere at the Greene. The best movie of the year. Can't see it, and not feel proud to be American. My thoughts..
1. None of us know how much we owe those veterans. Don't ever pass up a chance to say thank you when you see one.
2. Anyone working with Honor Flight Dayton is lucky. The board that runs the local program has national ties, works tirelessly, and are also heroes. I am lucky and proud to know each and every one of them. I didn't realize just how much until tonight.
3. Anyone who has a chance to see this movie and doesn't has no idea what they will be missing. It will change your life perspective and give you an appreciation for how lucky we are to live our lives the way we want to because of those generations that support and defend our way of life. All of them... WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, those in between and those fighting now. Our way of life and our choices are ours because we stand on the shoulder of those that paved the way. Our veterans are all heroes.
4. See this movie.
5. See this movie!

5674260,5,B00BU984DK,"I was attracted by the buzz at the front door of Constitution Hall here in Washington DC after work one Friday evening. Always seeking new a adventure, I was happily surprised at the invitation to come on in! The place was alive with folks young and old who had served our country militarily, and were there to celebrate and honor, and be honored right back. When the auditorium darkened, and images and voices of good honest folks from the midwest (Wisconsin mostly) came alive, and I saw the joy that Honor Flight is bringing to people all over the country by helping WWII veterans visit their memorial here in DC while they still can, tears started streaming down my face. Twice now, I have been at the airport when Honor Flight folks are disembarking for their special day, most with some devices helping them along (wheelchairs, walkers and the arms of loving family members) with local folks cheering them on. I have stopped to join the throng, hardly able to contain my emotion. It is incredibly moving and you just want to hug every one of them and say ""thank you for what you did in that war"". I've heard people say that the world WAS saved by these folks in WWII, literally. Evil was defeated. No hyperbole there. Since seeing the film, and while visiting my Mom's ""retirement home"", I met a WWII vet there with the models of the aircraft he flew in the war dangling outside his door. Still proud of his role. Still loving our country. How can I help THAT man get to DC for a day? Honor Flight is there. Thanks so much to the folks who made this film AND who started the Honor Flight movement. You make me proud to be an American, a midwest-expat living in DC. Here they come again...(those tears)... but they are happy ones.",1368835200,3,1735,4.493670886075949

On the micro level, it is a story of a community uniting to raise money to send 4+ flights (including 3x 747s) of WW2 veterans and volunteer ""guardians"" to see the WW2 Memorial in Washington, DC.  You learn the chilling personal accounts of Harvey, Julian, Orville, and Joe's war experiences in Europe, the Pacific, on Iwo Jima, and in a German POW camp, and their present lives in idyllic Port Washington, Wisconsin.  On the macro level it is the story of The Greatest Generation:  their selflessness and service to keep America free while not expecting anything in return for their sacrifices.

I am a teacher and football coach at Port Washington High School. Along with our head varsity coach and Superintendent, Dr. Michael Weber, I helped coordinate our entire high school football programs attending the record breaking premier at Miller Park. As a veteran myself, I truly believed our young men would benefit tremendously from attending this event; I was right. The overwhelming themes of patriotism and sacrifice in the movie was certainly a well-timed shot of medicine our country's youth desperately need to help cure them of the ills they routinely see on television, in the movies, and in the media.

The high school students/football players who attended the movie with us are respectful, hard working, goal oriented young men. I believe they are now also 100% more aware of why they live in the greatest country on the planet because of the movie and the experience of attending the premier. The environment you provided for them to witness this inspiring movie will be a memory that they (and I) will cherish for a lifetime. I purchased the Honor Flight DVD the day it was made available and keep it at the ready in my desk. I plan to show it to my students every year to keep the memory of that era alive and to serve as a reminder for our youth to appreciate the spirit of our capabilities when we are needed most.

This trip was just the beginning of a long road that was never traveled in our family, the history of what my grandparents sacrificed for us. The stories that have been hidden for over 70 years were now starting to surface, some of the good and of course some of the bad. What a great trip for not only my grandfather but for all of the family.

Our family and friends gathered together on August 11, 2012 to watch the Honor Flight movie at Miller Park, watching the stories unfold on the big screen really brought to light the stories we were now hearing in our family. This movie brought tears of love and honor from the 91 year old WWII vet to the 13 year old great grandchild who was just now learning what her great-grandfather and other WWII vets gave up for her. She is truly honored and shares her great-grandfathers stories when ever she can and she makes sure we are at as many home comings as possible to thank those that have served for her freedoms.

Since October 2011 my family has only missed one home coming at Mitchell Airport and will make many more in the future.

But is also so much more. The one day is the culmination of over 60 years of memories never spoken for some. Also the months prior to the trip gave these vets have a focus and a goal that in many cases gives them new purpose and energy. The day trip itself is like a giant emotional vitamin B shot for these heroes. You see them transfromed from men in their late 80's early 90's with their own maladies and limitaions to kids again. The smiles and sparkle in their eyes are forever etched in my memory. I made the trip with my Father and not only was he a 18 year old kid again but this trip was like an elixr that erased 30 years from him for the next several weeks.

The anticipation, the flight in a 747, the welcome to DC and all the memorials were incredibale. The trip home with mail call and the weclome home was the pinnacle. These vets deserve nothing but the best and this film gives them just that, a lasting tribute and recognition to the greatest generation !

We latch on quickly to any video, article, etc. about the Honor Flight Network.  We pre-ordered ""Honor Flight One Last Mission"" and watched it soon after it arrived.  It is a phenomonal view!  From beginning to end, it holds your interest.  Quite moving -- to the point of tears.

Seeing the vets, their families, and their chaperones, you can't help but feel that you're right there with them.  For all that they've experienced, these veterans are so humble and, at times, seem taken aback by the attention given to them.

Wonderful work on behalf of the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight community.  What started small grew to be an unbelievable gift to WWII vets and their families.  The impossible can be achieved!

The quality and content of the movie is wonderful.  FreeThinkMedia created a exceptional documentary that is worthy of the awards already received.  We hope it continues to be viewed by families, teachers, school children, and museums.

5674289,5,B00BU984DK,"Thank you for telling this meaningful story. These wonderful veterans come to DC every day and to witness their pilgrimage is a true honor.

I was moved to purchase this documentary based on my own experience with the Honor Flight group. I live in Washington, DC. A friend of our family is a WWII vet from Michigan. One Saturday in August he came with a group on an Honor Flight to visit the WWII Memorial.

As it was a Saturday my wife and I had plenty of things on our to-do list plus it was hot, humid and rainy. We had any number of reasons not to go. Once we got to the Memorial we found out the bus bringing the vets in from Baltimore-Washington Airport was running about an hour late. With our three-year old son in tow and rain on the horizon we were beginning to question our decision.

Anyway, their tour bus finally arrived and these older men, some in better shape than others, began to disembark. There were a number of VFW volunteers there to greet them, shake their hands and thank them for their service - it is hard to describe the feeling of pride and awe you feel seeing this. Foreign visitors to the Memorial lined up to have their pictures taken with the veterans, who seemed humble and a little embarrassed by all the attention.

At that point, out of a car that had been waiting in the handicapped lot for the whole time we had been waiting, comes Senator Bob and Elizabeth Dole. They were there to greet this random group of vets from Michigan. They spent well over an hour (on top of the time they were waiting for them) with these guys, talking, taking pictures, etc... I can tell you from spending time with several of the vets after they met Mr. and Mrs. Dole that it meant a great deal to them and they were very proud that someone so important would take the time to be there for them. Sen. Dole, is of course, a wounded WWII veteran.

They just don't make guys like these vets anymore.

After we got home my wife said going to the Memorial and witnessing these vet's trip was one of the highlights of her summer. I would have to agree.

The atmosphere was awesome all those veterans in one place it was by far the best event I've ever been to in my life and will never forget it. The anticipation of the movie was great, then when the movie started there wasn't a sound, now keep in mind there were over 28,000 people there and you could hear a pin drop. The stories we heard during the Honor Flight movie and how God used these brave kids to protect our country was amazing, sad and grateful all at once, Hollywood couldn't have fathomed this kind of stuff. After the movie as we were leaving I had to hug a veteran, and he was so thankful as were his two boys pushing him in that wheel chair made me proud to be an American again. I fell in love after that looking for ways I could help out I even was able to host a screening in my home town. That was such an important time and I think today's generation is losing sight of what these men and women went through and are going through for your freedom.",1368748800,,1200,4.110638297872341

The Honor Flight program got my attention when I was asked to write a letter for ""mail call"" on the flight home for a friend of mine.  I started reading about the program online and I was so impressed by the program that I started interviewing several of my friends who went on the honor flights for a newsletter I edit. Everyone of them said it was the best day of their lives. This journey meant the world to them. Most of  them had never talked about their experiences. They came home, got a job, and filed away all that had happened. This was the first time many had ""talked"" or even ""thought"" about what they did in WWII. It was the first time someone said ""Thanks!"" All I can say is what a terrific program!!!  Then I heard they were making a movie about the Honor Flights and it was going to premier at Miller Park and several of my friends were going to do a fly over for the event. They invited all the WWII veterans who had flown on the honor flights to attend a record setting opening. I was able to get a couple of DVDs by writing the sponsors of the program. The DVD gives us a glimpse into the Honor Flight program and follows several of the veterans who were a integral part of the journey. It does not disappoint! It makes you proud to be a part of the Honor Flight program that finally says ""Thanks for your service and all you did"" to the men and women who gave so much.

They never asked for recognition, and never got any. This is also the story of a group of volunteers who had the dream, of taking these WW2 vets back to Washington, D.C. to visit their monument before they pass into the dusty annals of time. The gathering together of people, young and old, to honor these veterans one last time is so compelling that I defy anyone to watch this and not shed tears of joy and pride.

He also got to go on the Honor Flight one-day trip to D.C.  While watching this, he got teary-eyed even. Also, seeing all of the other veterans and how they reacted was just phenomenal and very heart-warming to me!

This isn't just any typical documentary, this is history and about our heroes from WWII and what they went through in the war.  They will tell you about 3 different WWII veteran's stories and what happened when THEY were drafted out and what they had to go through/witness. The vet's were funny, but everything they talk about is very moving and will forever linger in my mind. I wish I could meet them personally (and every other veteran) so I could Thank them for what they did for us...

This documentary is enjoyable for the whole family - it is also a great history lesson for children, they will learn a lot about the war and some costs that came with it.

I was fortunate enough to be at Milwaukee's Miller Park for the premiere of this amazing video last summer, and words cannot convey the poignancy of the event. I was sitting between my husband who served on a nuclear submarine during the Cold War, and a rough-and-tough Marine who was disabled due to a service-related injury, and both men were dabbing away tears (as was I). It is so exhilarating and gratifying to see tribute finally paid to the WWII Vets who gave so much for FREEDOM, and so sad to know we are losing so many of them every day. I thank God some of them have been able to take part in Honor Flight and witness our nation's tribute as well as sense the gratitude our country has for them, as reflected in Washington, D.C.'s marvelous WWII Memorial.

What I didn't expect was to well up with tears five minutes in and as the movie unfolded, to literally feel my heart swell with pride.  No hollywood actors here. No fancy script writers.  The power comes from the words spoken by these quiet hometown heroes. Men and women we have all known in our families, or just as casual acquaintances, who have powerful stories to tell but who have never seeked the spotlight.  To see them honored and to experience their humble emotion is something very special.
As the lights came up in the theatre, people were hugging, shaking vets hands and thanking them.  What a wonderful project. What a magnificent movie!  By all means, see it.",1368662400,,953,4.576470588235294

If you have a relative from WW II, or know one, please see this to honor them.  Weather they are still with us or simply a treasured memory, as my dear father, Max L. Welsh who served in the Army Air Corps, CBI (China Burma India) and left us in 1988 is to me, you will treasure this movie.  See it twice!

I have had questions in my mind about whether our schools are providing enough of the facts about our history and our legacy in defending freedom.  I had hoped the stories in this film would arouse some inquisitive curiosity in the kids ( aged 10 to 15 ) and they would satisfy their questions  by reading or inquiring.  To my great surprise and satisfaction, the content of the video, in two hours, touched in depth on the reasons and horrors of what WW2 was like.  Their response reassured me that the message was deeply understood.  If you have family that you are not certain understand why the efforts of American armed forces and citizens in WW2 was so important to us and the free world, I strongly urge that you locate a showing in your area and take them to see it.

To realize that these men gave so much for us, for our freedom. They don't consider themselves heroes, but they are.  To see they looks on their faces.  It is like watching your own child experience some thing new for the first time.  Some have tears, some are smiling.  All of them are remembering...more than we could begin to understand.  Honor Flight is an all volunteer organization to show these veterans that we do remember their sacrifice.  That we do want them to know we thank them for all they did.  Everyone should see this, it should be shown in schools to all ages.  The greatest generation needs to know we appreciate them, we thank them, and we love them.",1368662400,,847,4.506578947368421

I'm the son of a WWII veteran, and several of my uncles served, one dying in March 1945 in the Philippines. This film was so moving, I have met and participated in flying veterans to the WWII Memorial with Honor Flight. There was not a dry eye in the house that night at the DAR. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if they had family in WWII.",1368662400,,433,4.166666666666667
5674332,5,B00BU984DK,"The world would be a better place if every American had the opportunity to watch the DVD ""Honor Flight - One Last Mission."" I pre-ordered the movie after attending a showing sponsored by Honor Flight of Northern Colorado. I guarantee that everyone in the audience was truly inspired by the entire Honor Flight experience and - yes - more than a few tears were shed. The back cover of the DVD used the LA Times' description of ""Enormously moving."" Worthy words, but this documentary is much more than that.

In today's world we need to ensure that those who follow understand the depth of the contributions made by this, ""the Greatest Generation."" Listening to veterans Joe Demler, Harvey Kurz and Orville Lemke share their very private World War II experiences offers a perspective for all of us as we begin to absorb the pain they witnessed and the sacrifices they made to keep our world free.

Less than two weeks ago I was blessed to serve as a Guardian with Honor Flight of Northern Colorado. This DVD truly conveys the Honor Flight experience and is a must-watch for young and old. One of the most moving statements made by one of ""my"" vets on the the bus trip to Denver International Airport before flying to Washington, D.C., was a reflection about how he was treated when he left Calcutta, India, as a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Watching as we approached highway overpass after overpass - each one filled by fire trucks with flags flying on buckets, firefighters saluting at attention and cheering supporters - he told me how so long ago they had to cover truck windows with screens to deflect rocks thrown at our troops. In contrast, at every stop on this trip our veterans were greeted by dignitaries, servicemen and women - even generals and bagpipers - and shown the respect that they so deserve because of their unselfish actions. Because of them, we are free. Sadly, these heroes are leaving us at an ever-increasing rate each and every day. We need to recognize their contributions to the world as we know it before it is too late.

The Honor Flight experience is so different. So magnificent. So well-deserved.

Purchase the movie. Share it with your friends. And support the many Honor Flight hubs around the nation. Better yet - be a Guardian. The experience will change your life.",1368662400,,2310,4.71039603960396

It was exciting because we had volunteered for the Honor Flights program the previous summer when we heard about it, and I was a guardian on the last flight they had for 2012.  It was amazing to see how this all got started and what goes into each and every flight, and how it's really taken off - no pun intended!  We knew how the Veterans felt from having experienced it all firsthand but to see how one unit began made it all the more meaningful.

The film is about how one unit began from one man's quest to make sure his patients got to see their memorial before it was too late, working tirelessly to make sure these Veteran's had a day to remember, maybe one of the best of their whole lives.  Right down to mail call, they generated support and enlisted community members until the program blossomed!  While this showcases just one unit, I would imagine most got their start in a similar fashion by people who wanted to make a difference.

There wasn't a dry eye in the audience because, if you didn't already know, the Veterans of this era are extremely humble and gracious people.  They are so appreciative of everything that they experience on their special day and this movie captures that perfectly.

I say it's a must see for all generations because people have forgotten how to be respectful and concerned about each other, and this movie reminds us that we have a short time in this life and to make the most of it while we can.  It's also a message to take care of each other rather than always be concerned about what others can do for us.

I am part of a youth organization called Young Marines, and we were so taken with the movie that we tried to get a showing in our local area, and were unfortunately unsuccessful; however, we do plan to show it to the sponsor of our unit since they recently hosted a dinner for an Honor Flights group from the West Coast.

Our family, including my father who served in WWII went to see the premier in Milwaukee where it set a Guiness record for attendance at a premier.  I purchased 2 videos, one to keep and one to give to a local high school. The high school generation has no idea how the war affected so many individuals.  This movie follows some who served and gives us as close to a first hand look at the effect it had.  How deserving these men and women were to be treated to a trip to Washington DC to see their memorial.  There are no words for the emotions that both my father and I had as we were privileged to be on an honor flight.

If you are a WWII history buff, or know any WWII veterans, or are just a fan of the 'Greatest Generation', you will find this a very inspirational film.  It is interesting to know that many of these WWII veterans such as the men featured in the film were our neighbors, acquaintances of our parents, fellow church members, and we may have never known their WWII history or that some were heroes of famous battles like Iwo Jima, Normandy, etc.  The 'Greatest Generation' was definitely one who did their jobs, sacrificed and didn't complain.

It is heartwarming to know of the Honor Flights which gave these WWII vets an opportunity to see the memorial that honors them, and a well deserved day in the sun.  It was inspirational to hear a little bit of the history of the 4 Wisconsin men featured in the film and the excitement they had leading up to the big day of the Honor Flight.  The Honor Flight itself seemed to be very well organized and all involved bent over backwards to ensure maximum enjoyment of the veterans on their day.

I get a lump in my throat every time I watch it. Very powerful and moving.

The story it tells makes me proud to be an American.
The song which was written to honor the Angel Flight crews and the fallen Heroes they carry on-board is a work of perfection.

Darden Smith (singer/songwriter - Austin, TX), Radney Foster (formerly of ""Foster & Lloyd"" - country band) and Darius Rucker of ""Hootie & The Blowfish"" all collaborated on the song, and and it is a wonderful piece of music.

He was fortunate to return home, start a successful business, and settle down with a wonderful woman.  He never brought up his time in the war but was always candid when I asked him about his experience. He told me stories of lost friends, amazing survival, and how to cherish what we have.  Seeing what he did shapes your perspective in ways a civilian could never understand.
 When he learned about Honor Flight, he submitted his application as fast as he could hoping to receive a place before his health wouldn't allow travel.  He was chosen some months later and you would have thought he was a young boy with a new toy!
On the day of his flight, we saw him off and knew it was going to be a day he would never forget and boy did it deliver!  I never saw him smile like when he came down the unbelievable reception line at the airport. It was the welcome home they all deserved and waited a long time to receive. Flags waving, bagpipes, drums, and hundreds of family members all in tears.
 When we learned about the Honor Flight movie, we knew we had to have it.  It is a first had account of what he saw that day but could not fully explain.  The movie does an amazing job of making you feel just like you are there with the veterans.  What they don't warn you is how attached you will feel to all these men and women who served our country and all of us with so much courage and humility.

a dry eye in the house when the final credits rolled. This documentary is a testament to all those
men and women that selflessly joined the fight to preserve and defend those freedoms and liberties
that are so often taken for granted in the present day. It makes one realize that these folks were
really the ""greatest generation!"" The movie has such a realistic flow to it and puts the viewer
in a place where the characters could be a grandparent or great grandparent. I later had the privilige of going on an actual honor flight, so I was able to experience the drama and excitement
that was so well displayed in the documentary first hand. I would recommend this work to any and
all. It is an uplifting experience. Tom Kent",1368662400,,824,4.5

That was a day I shall never forget, nor shall I ever forget what these vets, and vets everywhere have done for us.  We owe them our lives, our freedom.  The humble heroes of this movie ask for nothing, no recognition.  I am so happy that someone thought that they deserved it anyway.  And this movie does that.  Those who watch will experience their joys, their fears, their pain, and their humbleness.  It took a long time to honor them, but I'm so happy to see it happening.  You cannot help but be moved by this film.  And you will most definitely fall in love with these men.  I've met some of them in person.  They are real, they are wonderful.....and the movie, amazing.

Being able to visit with those who fought for the freedoms we enjoy makes a lovely day for me.  The soldiers of WWII are my heroes, and to shake their hand, get them to smile and thank them for their service brings me great pride.  When I first heard of Honor Flight it was on local TV news showing a flight leaving/arriving with many of those same heroes, people cheering, waving flags.  Brought tears to my eyes!  Having this DVD lets me relive the joy I see in our veterans faces when we thank them personally, and when they finally understand that We The People do understand that they changed the world.  The saga followed in the DVD could be in any state, anyones dad/grandpa/mom/grandma.  This is a wonderful tribute.

The movie details stories of several Wisconsin veterans:  their backstories, their trip, and their return to Wisconsin.  But it wasn't just about a few men and women, it was a tribute to ALL veterans who have been blessed with the longevity to be able to take part in a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.  We met many veterans, their families and friends.  Their comments before, during and after the flight were both humorous and touching.  These men and women haven't forgotten the horrors and sadness that they lived through, yet haven't forgotten that a sense of humor helps to get through discussions of them.

Please be sure to see this movie, which surprisingly didn't get an Academy Award nomination this year. I just wish my father was around to see it or be on an Honor Flight.",1368662400,,1071,4.6

There were alot of them, in their uniforms, some in wheelchairs, walkers, and some in incredible health.  Most of the audience was boomers and high school kids. There was not a dry eye in the house (including the students) after this film was played. If you have a heart, you can't help but be totally moved by the dedication you saw these men and women who were in the war, fighting for their freedom, as well as ours. When I walked out, I had a whole new perspective on the ""elderly"". When I did leave, there were vets outside proudly standing, and I could not help myself~~ I felt that I needed to give them a hug AND thank them for their dedication and service. You really see what these folks had to endure in the war, the conditions, and how they lost friends, and how they came back to the states to start their lives and families, and not talk about their experiences for years. This program, Honor Flight has opened their mouths and hearts. It has given them a voice and to talk about it. And to ""get-it-out-in-the-open"" and not hold all those awful nightmares they lived through. The men and women in the movie that they did the document on--they will make you cry, smile AND laugh. :)  Please think about buying this movie and then passing it along to show in your area in churches, lodges, at work.

Director Dan Hayes has done a fantastic job chronicling the frenzied efforts of a community to send the last of the living World War II veterans to Washington, DC so they can see the World War II memorial in person. What is so special about this movie is that it truly breathes life into the stories of the Greatest Generation in a way that resonates with young people of today- the young heroes that risked everything some 70 years ago, when many were still kids themselves, and the thousands that never made it home, really weren't that much different from young men and women today. I truly wish I could have seen this movie years ago when my own grandfather was still alive since I now have an even greater appreciation for what he and the members of his generation went through fighting for the freedom we so easily take for granted. Again I can't say it enough, this is a wonderful movie and I hope everyone is able to see it. A+++++, Bravo!",1368662400,,1022,4.470588235294118

I had never been to Washington, DC until I went as a guardian with the Central Missouri Honor Flight hub.  Since that first trip I've been eleven more times and on July 2, I will make my thirteenth flight.

On every trip, without fail, a veteran who might have been at Iwo Jima, Normandy, Anzio, or Bastogne tries to thank me for making the Honor Flight happen.  I have to turn away, collect myself, and turn back to say, ""NO, THANK YOU!""

I challenge you to experience this movie and not become an Honor Flight salesperson.  Get a veteran to sign up and ask him or her, ""How was the trip?""  It will make you a better person.",1368662400,,676,4.234375

His Grandfather refused to talk about WWII and now he understands why.  Unfortunately the Greatest Generation is dying in large numbers daily.  This film will make it possible for present and future generations to learn about a life-changing event.  The Final Mission is the perfect subtitle.  Many believe that this was one of the handful of best moments (marriage, birth of children) in their entire lives.  What a way to leave our presence. What a great tool for families to own to teach their children about The Greatest Generation.
This documentary is winning audience and critics awards for a reason: it features an important phenomenon in our history, The Honor Flight.  Started in Ohio, most states now sponsor Honor Flights. However, it is still strongest in the Midwest.  For example, Quincy Illinois has sponsored 18 Honor Flights; Billings, MT just started a year ago.  However, it is surprising how many people still do not know about Honor Flights.  This accurate documentary will help fill that gap.  What is also remarkable is how it touches audiences from middle school children to octogenarians.

When the movie was finished, there was not a dry eye in the theater.
We were so humbled and grateful for the sacrifices made by these brave veterans.
The humility of these individuals is so refreshing. Most of them consider themselves to be nothing special.
My conclusion is that each and every one of them is very special.
While just a few of the stories could be told within the movie, and they are amazing stories (our boys still talk about Joe), I came to realize that every Veteran that served is special and deserves the honor of having someone that knows their story about their contributions.
My husband accompanied his Dad on an Honor Flight about 2 years ago and our three boys have gotten to hear first hand what their grandfather's contribution to World War II was. We bought the movie for Dad for his birthday and we are looking forward to getting  to watch it with him. We also bought it for our neighbor who was an army nurse during the war.

The realism of the veterans being honestly raw with the sharing of their memories, showing their emotions and touching each audience member very personally. The background on how Stars & Stripes began with an idea that caught fire and captured an entire community to throw themselves this very worthy cause by working diligently to raise funding. The small and large sacrifices of the board members, volunteers and others to give a tour of a lifetime for the WWII veterans to see their memorial that took 60 years to build. Watching them see the memorial, share their experiences and become 18 again not only during their trip but from the moment they arrive at the early morning hours at the airport. Listening to them share with every detail carving into my memory and heart the tale of their service and having it come alive as if I was there with them. It is a must see for every American to truly appreciate the freedoms we now sometimes take for granted and share with their loved one the conversation about veterans in their own personal history. A definite film to be incorporated into every Social Studies classroom where WWII is taught as a platform for discussion of the meaning behind the Greatest Generation. I know now why they are pen named this title.

No matter if you are 8 or 80, take an evening to watch what I feel is a remarkable film. It will make you enjoy this thing we call life even more. You may just find yourself thanking that veteran that you see at the grocery store or at church. It will make you want to pick up the phone and call your dad or grandpa or even great grandpa. Our days with them are limited, but this film will live on forever. I highly encourage you to purchase this film, no only for yourself, but for a loved one as well. You will be a better person because of this movie. I promise.",1368662400,,909,4.2298850574712645
5674408,5,B00BU984DK,"This production is so well done. It captures the deep appreciation that our remaining WWII veterans have for the opportunity to make this journey. It gives the audience a real understanding of how much effort and money goes into each trip made back to DC. Honor Flight the movie, should be shown in every school classroom, and on TV regularly!

Our younger generations have seen very little that reflect the lives of those who lived this time in our history.  This movie gives those who fought, died and those who returned home a voice.  They deserve to be honored in all ways before time takes them from us.  You will see faces of true heroes, and those who honor them.  The Honor Flight Organizations in every state deserve our support.

This movie not only paid a great honor to these great men and woman. It also allows our current generation and those to come see some of the faces of combat and allow them to understand the realities of war. This movie will leave you in a sense of sadness for but filled with so much pride and honor. Don't ever forget to thank a Veteran.,1368662400,,473,4.325842696629214
5674416,5,B00BU984DK,"My grandfather (""Papa"") is my WWII hero. He served 30 years in the US Navy, during WWII, Korea and Vietnam, and retired with honors as CWO-4. Papa turned 95 on January 26, 2013, which also happened to be my 1st wedding anniversary. I had pre-ordered Honor Flight: One Final Mission for him as part of his Father's Day gift, knowing it wouldn't arrive in time for his birthday. Sadly, Papa died unexpectedly on February 21.

My DVD arrived in the mail on a Saturday not long after Papa's memorial service. My husband and I sat down to watch it the next evening, and we were speechless. We laughed, we cried, we were moved beyond belief by the four WWII heroes whose stories were told in this film, and by Joe Dean, chair of Stars & Stripes Honor Flight, and his team, as well as their entire Port Washington community that came together to honor the men and women of our Greatest Generation. We got online immediately to find a way to get involved with our local Honor Flight hub, and we share the film with anyone and everyone we can. You will not be disappointed! Everything we do, from this day forward, to help our veterans is done in honor of my Papa...my hero.

Thanks to the filmmakers and producers for this amazing film!!!

It was an amazing film that captures history and the fact that many of these veterans have lived with the stories and struggles of war kept close to the chest for years. Fair warning-you'll need a lot of tissues.",1368662400,,569,4.865979381443299

The documentary was done VERY WELL. My sisters and I went to DC to see the memorial about 3 years ago and brought back many memories.

Tweens/teens need to understand that these men were actually 18 years young, yet fought in battles as if they were adults. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and teach you to listen closely to the stories your older family members share. The Honor Flight program is amazing.

These veterans bravely displayed their strength, mental fortitude, and the belief in freedom and liberty. That is really what drove these men to serve their country. It might not have been the reasons when drafted, but they quickly became their reasons every day. This incredible group of individuals aren't called part of ""The Greatest Generation"" for nothing. These men gave everything they had, and somehow found the strength to give just a little bit more. We have much to learn and little time from these incredible individuals. Please take the time to get involved with your local chapter of Honor Flight, or start one of your own. They are scattered throughout the country, but more help is needed. Get involved, it is an experience that you won't be disappointed in.",1367712000,3,937,4.974522292993631

This movie brought it all back--the excitement, the tears, the pride of those exhausted but thrilled members of our Greatest Generation. ""Honor Flight"" came to our local theater at a stressful time in my life when my expectations of folks were pretty low. Seeing this movie and reliving our trip with Dad at my side IMMEDIATELY returned my perspective to the correct view--awe, humility and gratitude for our freedom, purchased by them then and being purchased by our Vets and Active Duty personnel today. ""Thank you for your service"" will never be enough.  I intend to order at least one more copy on payday.

It is an important reminder of the sacrifices made by so many young men as they fought for Freedom in WWII.  Every country that was freed by these brave men is still free today.  Those fortunate enough to return home were part of the great generation that went to work every day and served their communities while raising their families.

I will never forget them and the sacrifices they made for our country.
The Honor Flight Network's mission is clearly shown, along with how much planning & work is involved in giving
these hero's their day of honor.
As you experience the day with them, you get a glimpse into their lives and families.
Many times I smiled, cried and cheered for them throughout the film.

They don't think they did anything special.  Uncle Sam called and they answered.  To have them join with hundreds of other Vets to fly for free to Washington DC is amazing.  Joe Dean and all the board members of the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight out of Milwaukee are to be commended for the way they organized hundreds of volunteers to make this all happen.

Very poignant and moving.  Lots of heartwarming moments.  Everyone should see this documentary.  You'll never think the same way again about that elderly gentleman (or woman) on your block.  Are they Vets?  Invite them over to watch.  You'll be very glad you did.",1365724800,3,782,4.627737226277373

5674437,5,B00BU984DK,"This documentary follows the story of four WWII veterans hoping to visit the WWII Memorial in DC, and the ""Honor Flight"" organization that helped make their dreams (and those of thousands of other vets) come true. From the beginning notion that this could be done, to the collected efforts of determined volunteers and fundraisers, through the actual trip to DC, this documentary delivers straightforward -- yet very touching -- details about this important effort and the people that make it happen.  The stories of the veterans themselves are beyond description.

As the movie progressed and the veterans' trip was almost over, I found myself dreading their return flight home -- and then came yet another incredible surprise. There simply is no anti-climax in this movie.  It keeps on giving.

I'm not one to cry at the movies AT ALL, but this one really got me! There's just too much WONDERFUL here. The joy in the faces of the veterans (and everyone else) is beyond description.  It's not every day you get to witness dreams coming true.

We laughed and cried, and ""felt"" the trip at a level that might not have happened without watching the video first.  The only thing Mom objected to was that they didn't feature any women.
