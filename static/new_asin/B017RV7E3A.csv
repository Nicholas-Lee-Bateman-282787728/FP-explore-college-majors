8740428,3,B017RV7E3A,"The first cd of Flying Colors was done by Steve Morse and Neal Morse as the second was the results of the collaborations of each member which gives more variety and quality in the music. The music is still song/vocals oriented almost AOR and Pop with progressive elements. The most progressive and longer tracks are ""Open up Your Eyes"" and ""Mask Machine"" with more complex time signatures. Neal Morse's keyboards while not having a major role like in his solo career brings some atmosphere in the music, also McPherson does most of the singing. We are in front of talented musicians here. Dave Larue in the first song add some interesting bass lines to the melody. Steve Morse's guitar solo are abundant and melodic. ""The fury of My Love"" starts as a ballad with piano and vocals and develop the melody in the Beatlesque fashion. I didn't enjoy the acoustic medley from Casey McPherson repertoire. There's plenty of typical classic pop rock songs in the edge of hard rock that include a welcome little rhythm change for Progressive listeners., but don't expect another Transatlantic or Spock's Beard type of music. Some tracks have too much simplicity, for example ""Kayla"" and ""Shoulda Woulda Coulda"", i suspect some humor in the latter, but ""Cosmic Symphony"" is quiet different and enjoyable. This concert is well presented with 24 cameras in high definition with two types of surround sound.",1470182400,,1393,4.931914893617021
