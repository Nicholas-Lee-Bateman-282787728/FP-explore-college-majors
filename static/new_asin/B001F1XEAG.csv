8412513,5,B001F1XEAG,"Despite being made in Japan, this disc is Region ""0"", not Region ""2"".  This is clearly stated on the package.  Buyers worldwide can rest assured it will play, as long as your DVD player supports NTSC.",1473379200,,200,4.527777777777778
8412514,1,B001F1XEAG,"This video could have been great. There is some great footage but it is overshadowed by the worst editing I've ever seen.  The images are scrambled up like a kaleidoscope, twisted, put upside down, spun around for minutes at a time making it a headache to watch.  I wouldn't pay more then $5.00 for this.  It is so badly mangled that it is un-watchable when the editing happens and it happens fairly frequently.  It would have been a great dvd if they didn't edit it but someone got new editing software for Christmas and couldn't wait to destroy something great with it.  I was so disappointed with this and have since thrown it out.",1444521600,,634,4.526315789473684
