7855226,2,6303890385,"Beastmaster 3 sheds light on Dar as he travels to meet an evil wizard who is holding his brother (the King) prisoner in an effort to extract information that would lead to acquiring the powers of an evil demon named Braxus. In a very predictable manner with `clich' written all over it, Dar struggles to get past the hurdles laid before him.
In short, the acting is horrid, the setting is noteworthy, the action sequences are sad, the humor is just not there (at all), the music is poor, while the plot and the dialogues are average and pathetic respectively.
Braxus looks like a teenage mutant ninja turtle while the actors (especially the extras) and the writers should be sent to Guantanamo `on holidays' indefinitely.
On the upside Sandra Hess would be a fine asset for the adult film industry. She is something else!
Overall, it seems as though the actors/writers/directors/producers met up with each other at a hotel lounge over drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make a quick and easy film to keep themselves busy while waiting for a good break (and which apparently has not yet materialized).
In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here...  1.5 Stars",1218067200,2,1199,4.764423076923077

JUST GIVE IT UP. SAD TO SAY, BUT THE MAGIC OF THE BEASTMASTER IS COMPLETELY GONE.",1059523200,,259,4.2
7855229,4,6303890385,"Okay, so it isn't O'Neill.  The script could even be called a bit silly but...how can you not love it?  Fans of the original Beastmaster will like this installment.  I'll admit it isn't as good as the original but the  story is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.  And Marc Singer still  looks FANTASTIC!  Who could ask for more?",936748800,15,336,4.5
