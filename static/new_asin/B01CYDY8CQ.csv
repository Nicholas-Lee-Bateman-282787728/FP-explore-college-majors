meant for British tv.  Am quite unhappy about this
and would like a replacement or my money back.",1519689600,,152,4.033333333333333

8754359,4,B01CYDY8CQ,"My husband and I are great British TV fans.  We both enjoyed this series.  There were few (if any) truly likable characters, but nevertheless they were interesting.  The crime stories became a bit redundant, but still managed to keep our interest.  Oh heck!  Even a mediocre British series is better than the boring stuff on American TV (speaking of redundant!)  Scott is the only real grownup, while Bailey is a bit over-the-top train wreck about to happen in her personal life, but a darn good cop. The Bailey character is too much of a  female caricature of  the commitment-phobic, womanizing male cop. She is the commitment-phobic, hard-drinking, MANizing(?) female cop.  It gets somewhat frenetic.  Nevertheless, if you like Brit drama or crime stuff, you'll probably enjoy this.",1496361600,,784,5.102362204724409
8754360,5,B01CYDY8CQ,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 2, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.

Series five is the last series. They try to wrap things up, Gill is gone, Rachel is acting DCI, Janet has home problems, and whether everything works out is left to us to figure out.

Recommended. prisrob 04-02-17",1491091200,,2211,4.531328320802005

DC Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) is single, tough, and a long-legged looker for a cop. Partner DC Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) is married with child, 10 years older at 40, and together they work for Manchester Metropolitan Police solving murders. Their complex personal lives are emotional and can conflict with the job. But they are good, tough, smart and episodes continually carry not only a murder plot but the ongoing plots of their relationships with each other and those around them. Well written, believable, well-acted with a fine supporting cast, and it all adds up to the reason Scott and Bailey lasted for 5 seasons and was ended in 2016 on a high note, a decision NOT based on lack of viewers, as done with Downton Abbey.

Each season has an ongoing plot or issues as well as the episode event changes in the lives of individual cops. Tony Mooney and David Prosho assist the female duo as part of the team missing only 3 episodes between them. Amelia Bullmore performs as the boss of the murder team, missing only the final 3 episodes. She, like Scott and Bailey have already moved on to new acting roles, likely the decision to make the shorter and 5th season a wrap.
== == == SDH SUBTITLES are provided for all Region 1 sets.
Region One DVDs of Seasons 1-5 comprise 33 episodes totaling 1569 minutes. They can be bought at the time of this review (Dec 2016) NEW on Amazon as individual season for a total of $108 and change making episodes 3.29 each. In my opinion the entire series is worth the priceheavens I paid more, buying one at a time.
You will be glad you bought all 5 and can go from one season right into the next once you begin watching. There is even personal life story carry-over one season to the next.
If you have a multi-region DVD player, then you have an option for buying the import PAL 1-5 set. Make sure you buy, and make sure you buy the right set for your player, and then enjoy........",1482883200,3,2113,4.516971279373368
