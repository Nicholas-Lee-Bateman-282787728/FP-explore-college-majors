8161884,5,B000B882HE,"I was introduced to Checkfield by way of Chip Davis/Mannheim Steamroller, the creator of American Gramaphone Records, and my brother. Their music is diverse in its style and moods. Live at Five has always been one of my favorites. To hear their music in 5.1, especially when natural elements (rain, birds, etc) are brought into the mix, creates a. immersing experience,  like never before!  It's extremely disappointing that the technology did not catch fire. Music in 5.1 is the only way to listen, IMO!!  Check your bluray/DVD player specs for compatibility before purchasing. Though, mine says it will not play DVD audio, it does actually play. It's a Samsung BD5900.",1455408000,,670,5.072727272727272
