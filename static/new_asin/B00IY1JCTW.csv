6304423,1,B00IY1JCTW,"Not interesting, not funny.  Typical toilet humor that frankly, just wasn't very good.  Sorry, but this is ""B"" material.",1432339200,2,120,5.2631578947368425

6304426,5,B00IY1JCTW,"Queen of irreverent comedy lets go of the ""clueless inadvertent racist"" shtick that launched her into stardom 10 years ago and unloads a steamy pile of totally irreverent stickiness.  She still maintains that certain ""clueless"" or accidentally tasteless element though, make no mistake.  Jokes are sourced by plundering society's underbelly, taboo stuff like porn, showering under your mom's pubic hair drippings, and of course rape.  A competent musician, she ends the CD with a song where the entire chorus consists of one taboo word. For the uninitiated her style may come as shocking, vulgar.  For those of us who have followed since her beginnings with bit parts in the David Cross/Bob Odinkirk 1990's HBO masterpiece ""The Mister Show"" this is refreshing, more evolved material than her previous aforementioned ""shtick"".",1417737600,17,825,5.372093023255814
6304427,1,B00IY1JCTW,"very disappointing. I only bought the dvd because she won an Emmy Award. Then I view it and, while vulgar she was mildly amusing, but an EMMY? Sorry Sarah. I do not see why you won an award for your show. On my worst day, even with a hangover, I could have done a better job.
Maybe you won this award for some other skills and abilities of which we the people no nothing.",1414972800,4,371,4.027027027027027

6304429,5,B00IY1JCTW,"This special is many times better than her previous ones. She's grown a lot as a stand up comedian. She always had something that made her ""Sarah"" but it was always kind of a gimmick to get the audience interested in the actual framework behind the jokes. This special is pure comedy. Her and Maria Bamford might be the two funniest female comics ever, and they definitely rank highly with the greats of any generation, and yes i'm including Pryor, Hicks and Carlin and all them.",1409961600,9,479,4.5813953488372094

6304431,3,B00IY1JCTW,She doesn't know religion enough to joke broadly about it yet. The myth of religion provides so much material for comedians. But jokes fall flat if they haven't researched and fact checked first.,1490572800,,195,4.9393939393939394

6304457,5,B00IY1JCTW,I enjoyed it very much.,1467676800,,23,3.8
6304458,5,B00IY1JCTW,"I really appreciate Silverman's outrageousness and her attack of political correctness, which in her case is coming from the left. While watching this I did not realize that it was from 2013 and thought that she had finally developed the ability to subtly explain who and what she is attacking. I'm thinking ""George Carlin lives . . . and he's found a body that is  really hot!""
I agree with those who criticize the beginning, which is Sarah outside the club, pre-show. It goes on too long and is not particularly funny. However, I'm not sure if it was her intent, but the fact that I thought of the 3 gentlemen in the car as ""dangerous"" while she obviously does not, forces me to consider my uncionscious bias.",1467504000,,711,4.5546875
6304459,4,B00IY1JCTW,"After watching Sarah's movie ""I smile back"" on Prime,  I thought I'd give this a shot. I always liked her, but always saw her in small doses. The HBO stand up was cute & funny and quite an accomplishment considering the era and expectations/limitations women comics had to deal with...especially with censorship being stricter as were the ""rules"" for behavior for women. She cannot be compared to more modern comics of today who didn't suffer the same stereotypic expectations, limitations , gender-based  constraints,  In that context she was a trailblazer. While I enjoyed it, I can't get her multilayered amazing performance in smile back out of my head to give her a fair analysis of her comic  gifts, but she  was still wonderful and worth the time.",1466985600,,754,4.905511811023622

6304474,1,B00IY1JCTW,"Rape jokes are never funny! Not only did Sarah Silverman make rape jokes, she made the victims/survivors of rape into joke puns.

6304723,3,B00IY1JCTW,"I've really enjoyed Sarah's comedy for years, from her duets with her sister many many years ago before she became a known performer, to her guitar song ""I'm f***king Matt Damon"", her various political ads, and so many talk show performances. It's true, some of her bits do come off as trying too hard for a laugh from shocking and making audience uncomfortable at moment. But I noticed something interesting. OK, this is dated 2013, and for sure Sarah and her style have long ago preceded Amy Schumer... But 2014-2015 begat the year of Amy Schumer, and having seen many examples now of her performances, I really have to say that, technique-wise, Amy actually pulls off in a much more seamless manner that ""throwing away"" a joke line, then looking puzzled when the audience laughs. Multiple times in this funny Sarah HBO special, she had calculated written material whose jokes were constructed this way  with the throw away line, then the puzzled kind of ""What??"" look to the audience like ""What did i say? I didn't say anything wrong"" and playing all that for a laugh.  Sarah's very polished in both her timing and ease in performance but I have to say, perhaps due to the intimacy of the audience size just 39 people, her technique showed ... and my point is, I hate to say it but for that category of joke construction, Amy is far more polished and naturalistic where you just can't see half her witticisms coming. ... This is not to take anything away fom Sarah, but I just felt overall, the material that comprised this show didn't feel that strong. It was surprisingly moralistic and almost kind of preachy re the lies we all tell ourselves... as well as social commentary on neediness of people at certain stages in life. And to that extent it was a great use of the comedy form to communicate things that matter. There were some purely funny bits  her dog's farts being like the worst of every ethnicity's, then breathed through her grandpa's teeth, her mother getting benefits of Jewish Volunteer Services in the hospital when how could they know she was Jewish by her name  ""turns out they work from a list of who rings the call button the most"".",1440201600,2,2158,4.641361256544503

6304747,5,B00IY1JCTW,"Sarah Silverman first caught my eye in the movie ""The Aristocrats."" I loved that movie, and I loved all the comedians in it without exception, but Sarah Silverman I thought was the only one who truly brought her A game to that movie. To give you context, I hadn't watched television at this point for about six years, and probably watched maximum six movies a year. The friends I watched the movie with were all much more tuned in, and after the movie Sarah Silverman was all they wanted to talk about, whether she was racist, whether she went too far.

When I let myself back into American pop culture like a hungry child let loose in a candy store, I had my eyes and ears wide open for this comedian. Now I have read the reviews out there, and there are people who say that Sarah Silverman ""tries too hard"" to be dirty. I take umbrage with this. Sarah Silverman is not trying too hard to be anything in this movie except perhaps upbeat. To me she looks like a tired crusader. In the George Bush years she was out on network television doing a show nobody watched that advocated marriage equality and a more liberal attitude toward marijuana. In doing the sort of humor she does, she is venturing into the terrain of comics like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks, all of whom have their detractors, but all of whom are also praised as genius, and all of whom are men.

A lot of the things that Sarah Silverman was crusading for are coming true politically. The younger generation seems to be steering us toward a more tolerant and civilized nation...I'm not talking about red state/blue state stuff, I'm talking about the fact that what with technology and all, things are changing so fast we might all be flying around in jet packs after all in our lifetimes. Don't rule anything out.

If Sarah Silverman's comedy style in this HBO special must be pigeonholed into a category, I would suggest we embrace a paradox and call it ""dead serious comedy."" And again, I'd say that Silverman's direct predecessors include Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks and George Carlin while I'm at it. All these people were people who lived at war not so much with American politics as American culture, because American culture was not tolerant enough for them, because they engaged in behaviors and expressed thoughts that made it so they would never be considered role models by the general public. Don't let the fact that they are all celebrated after their deaths make you forget that each one of these great, generous performers struggled with controversy and with their own self-destructive habits (Carlin, I think, being the one who managed to defy everybody's expectations by living to a ripe old age and never backing down). When I see this video, with Sarah Silverman making original and well thought-out comedy about issues we all need to think about, and that most lesser comedians would not dare touch lest they screw it up, I think here's a comedian who is well ahead of her time.",1439251200,,2990,4.648393194706994

And. when done right ""offensive"" material can be downright brilliant. This definitely wasn't one of those moments.

It takes A LOT to offend me, but she managed to surpass my threshold with a joke that started off with ""9/11 widows give the best hand-jobs"". At that point I was pretty much soured. I didn't really care about the rest of her act after that. Why waste my time? And, like I said I LOVE the first Amendment, so I would never tell someone what they can and can't say.

There's a lot of fearlessness about her.  You can tell she put a great deal of thought into each line.

I've pretty much been a fan of most everything she does and I was hoping this would be fun, but I felt kind of sorry for her.  I like shocking and socially awkward humor for sure, but this set seemed phoned in and then when she talks politics and religion.  Instead of being actually funny, it was more pandering to the lowest common denominator.  And that is a real sign of weakness.  I feel I should qualify this by letting you know, I thought her having sex with god bit on the Sarah Silverman show was HILARIOUS.  She doesn't do much with religion here, but the little bit she does do seems more like a nod to atheists and her bit with politics was more of the same for liberals.  Both of these were a very small portion of her set, mind you, but if she goes there, she should be funny and not just make a weak move to gain acceptance from the audience.

All said, I feel like this might have been more funny in person, but not so much for streaming.",1433548800,2,1034,4.109452736318408

If our history no matter how dark & nasty, was reduced to her poor one liners we'd all be dead before the ""Jews killed Jesus"". Which seems to be a recurring topic for her. She probably only had 39 people in her audience for this one because that's how many people actually think she is funny. She was great on Crank Yankers! See, I'm not all that negative like her.

People look for different things with comedians.  I personally hate late night monologue stuff where you're supposed to smile idiotically at punchlines you can see coming a mile away.  For others, that's relaxing.  And trust me when I say I'm not belittling people's tastes.  I love the NFL and sci fi and if that stuff isn't for immature idiots, I don't know what is!  If you're unfamiliar with Sarah Silverman, you may incorrectly pidgeon hole her as being a pretty-faced vulgarian or going ONLY for shock.  But that stuff is mainly a misdirect, imo, for some really creative insights.  I love it when someone sees the same thing I do, but their way of describing it is something I'd never think of.  With Sarah Silverman, I'm always asking myself  'where is she going with this bit?'  And she almost always surprises me.  Except the song at the end-- I saw that coming a mile away!  And that rape joke she told.. that's one of the coldest things I ever heard.  And one of the funniest.  It was like the Louis C.K. pedophile joke on SNL.  If you like your comedians to make you feel uneasy and make you see the world around you in a different way, you can't go wrong with Sarah Silverman.  If you like your comedians to simply reinforce things you already believe, but with a funny voice or a non-threatening joke at no one's expense, then you may want to look elsewhere.  I gave it four stars because I'm pretty sure she ripped off Bill Maher at one point.  And also going with a 39 person audience was a pretty big mistake, imho.",1433030400,2,1631,4.412751677852349

Nobody knows what your cup of tea is, also if you didn't watch the whole thing I don't think you should even be allowed to leave a review in the first place, because you've literally stated that you have no idea what you're talking about.

Sarah Silverman, regardless of gender is one of the best comedians alive today, her sets are intricate lattice-works of provocation, designed by someone who understands human nature to a degree where she often feels more like a clinical psychiatrist, than comedian.

Most of these reviews are just heartbreaking to someone who has spent their life loving standup and comedy in general, someone who see's Sarah Silverman as a shining example of where hard work, dedication, and talent all meet to become greatness. If you got nothing from this special or any of her work prior, I feel truly sorry for you, because that probably means that this isn't the only great entertainment that you're missing out on.",1529625600,,1387,4.680327868852459
