In this video you learn an 8 minute choreography to Esmaooni, one of my favorite songs from Leila's Sukara album. I especially like the review after each segment that adds on what you just learned in the choreography in the way that dancers actually learn choreographies - by starting at the beginning and dancing up to the point that you have laerned. Also, there is a bonus hour of live footage from one of her Cairo shows included with the video that is super valuable to watch and have, too!",1352764800,6,626,4.358974358974359
