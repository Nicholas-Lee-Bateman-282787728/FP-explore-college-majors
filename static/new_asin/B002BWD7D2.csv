8362111,5,B002BWD7D2,Seen it for the very first time and loved it. I had to have it for my movie collection. Alexander Fu Sheng played a son who's father was killed in a fight and his mother was killed by him (his father). He grew up being naughty and got into some trouble but soon he was adopted by a famous kung fu master and his wife. You must see the movies to get the rest of the story I promise you won't be disappointed.,1424822400,,407,3.9156626506024095
8362112,1,B002BWD7D2,"The copy was crisp and clean with no visual defects, but the movie as a whole completely made no sense at all. The fights are good, but there is no plot to this at all. Buy it to round out your Alexander Fu Sheng collection, but not for a good movie.",1414800000,,250,3.9215686274509802
8362113,4,B002BWD7D2,This is arguably one of the best of the Brave Archer series incorporating great sword fighting sequences that thrill and excite.,1370563200,2,128,5.142857142857143
8362114,4,B002BWD7D2,"For latecomers, Alexander Fu Sheng is NOT the star of ""Brave Archer and His Mate"", contrary to the DVD packaging and the Celestial trailer included on the disc. Still, Fu Sheng completists and people who love the Venoms will grab this one without hesitation, despite its flaws....According to Brian Camp, this movie was based on an adaptation of the followup to the book ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"" (of course, I haven't read it). Still, it appears director Cheh decided to jettison most of the characters [featured in the previous installments] because he was bored and decided on a new story featuring some of the ""Venoms"" group. The results are obvious; those of us who went from buying ""BA"" to ""BA&HM"" got quite a jar! The fight choreography of the 3 ""Venoms"", plus the ""baby Venoms"" in attendance, saves the film from derailment. Kuo Chui is a good choice for replacing Fu Sheng, BUT Fu Sheng should not be here, period, though his prescence is welcome (he has his moments, and his last line must SOMEHOW sum up his working with Cheh). This Well Go USA release is one of their better releases, the only flaw being that the English subtitles come with the Chinese subtitles on, TOO! It blocks the screen a bit, but it's not excessive. The original Mandarin dub is NOT doctored with!",1252454400,8,1288,4.70353982300885
