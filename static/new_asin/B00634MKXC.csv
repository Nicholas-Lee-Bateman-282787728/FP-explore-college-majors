8491775,4,B00634MKXC,"I have been into studying conspiracy theories for a long time. Whether you believe or not, they are very entertaining. Having said that, this dvd delivers. Lots of fresh info. I'd suggest checking it out.",1357689600,5,204,4.857142857142857
8491776,3,B00634MKXC,"This covers some random topics, glued together by the fact that they are all unconventional knowledge.  The diversity--snakes, pyramids, secret societies--as well as the overall credibility kept me interested.",1353456000,3,209,6.206896551724138
8491777,3,B00634MKXC,"Robert Bauval kicks off this 3.5 hour compilation with an extended interview, fascinating and convincing.  Beginning with his discovery that the three great pyramids of Egypt mirror the size and arrangement of the three stars in Orion's belt, Bauval advocates looking at ancient civilizations with an astronomer's eye to explain the ancient's civilizations' behavior.  The sky is a book we don't read anymore, he claims.

Legend of the Serpent is the 2nd DVD, describing ""The Biggest Religious Cover Up in History,"" which I think might be a stretch.  There's no doubt snakes have been a large part of religious iconography through the ages, and this pretty much covers it.

The third DVD is a thought-piece by producer-director Gardiner, his ""history of the world,"" with strong emphasis on the spiritual, Knights Templar and other ""ancient wisdom"" presumably lost or hidden from us now.

All in all, not a bad way to learn about the ancients and medieval times.",1340496000,7,961,5.089171974522293
8491778,3,B00634MKXC,"No shock that conspiracies have been around forever. Philip Gardiner has made a career out of studying them, it seems, and he puts a lot of that information into these DVDs. Secret societies, snake worship, all the way back to ancient civilizations, he shows what he believe is fact or myth. Whether or not you agree, it's interesting stuff.",1338854400,2,341,4.796610169491525
