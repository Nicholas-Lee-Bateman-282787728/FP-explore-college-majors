7857508,4,6303646964,I enjoy using this tape.  I also use Tony littles Abdominal Muscle toning tape.,1265760000,,79,4.642857142857143
7857509,4,6303646964,"This is a good QUICK ab workout video.  Its not as thorough or as intense or as long as his other ab workout video but it still hits a variety of ab muscles.  We still use this one, especially when we're in a time crunch which happens a lot.",1229040000,,241,3.8979591836734695
7857510,5,6303646964,"This is a great workout. I usually get bored with aerobics but the exercises of Tony are just great! I do them every morning before going to work and they give me energy, my body is shaping very nicely and mostly I have fun while exercising. Even my husband started doing the exercises now! I strongly recommend this video.",999475200,5,323,4.491525423728813
7857511,5,6303646964,"I like this video, because Tony does one exercise at a time.  He doesn't try to mix up a bunch of fancy moves all at once.  He works on upper abs, then moves on to obliques - working one side at a time, and then does lower  abs.  So he covers all the bases without making you feel like you're in an  aerobics class!  Yes, he does act a little silly in the video, but the  workout is great!  This video also has a timer for beginners,  intermediates, and advanced, so anyone can do it.",961459200,11,484,4.010526315789473
