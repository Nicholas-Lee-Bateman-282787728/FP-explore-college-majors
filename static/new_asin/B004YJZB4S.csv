4499868,5,B004YJZB4S,"""There Be Dragons"" is an amazing look into the life of a saint and his life during the Spanish Civil War. I was literally speechless after the movie, stunned by its impact, and it has actually changed my life in a huge way. I will be buying dozens of this movie to give to friends, and I hope you will too!",1321056000,,306,4.032786885245901

I will buy many copies and give them away.  It didn't get much attention in the theaters, but as the word spreads the DVDs should reach many people. No one seeing it will walk away unchanged.

4499877,1,B004YJZB4S,I bought this movie thinking it was going to be about St. Josemaria but it is not. He is in it but only very little. The movie follows the life of one of his childhood friends and involves murder and fornacation and other sinful acts in huge amounts. This is a terriable movie and I do NOT recommend it to anyone.,1483228800,,313,4.147540983606557

4499893,2,B004YJZB4S,"June 21st:  After having finished watching this movie I realized that I knew very little about Jose M. Escriva...the movie seemed disjointed.  It was more about Escriva's friend - I'd hoped more would be shown about the work founded by Escriva and for which he is so well known: ""Opus Dei"" - I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wanted to learn about his life, his personality, his character.",1466467200,,402,4.647887323943662

4499895,5,B004YJZB4S,I enjoyed the drama about Josemaria and Manolo immensely. Two boys who used to be friends in early 20th century Spain and the different paths each took as civil war commenced. I rarely watch a movie at home without stopping it to do something else. This one kept me hooked.,1465603200,2,273,4.48
4499896,3,B004YJZB4S,"So, this film has a somewhat intriguing story centered around a father and son...and the Spanish Civil War.  Tossed into that mix is an add-on story about the founder of Opus Dei and his origins.  The father and the founder of Opus Dei interact some, but it's not really central to the main plot.  The founder of Opus Dei, along with all priests apparently, are being pursued by supporters of the elected government.  Why is that?  The movie never tells.  What is the basis for the Spanish Civil War...well, the same for any war, I guess.  Powerful factions can't agree on how to share power.  The movie barely mentions that the fascists/Spanish military are being aided by the Nazi's.  Aid to the Spanish military simply comes from Germany...no reason given.  The film barely mentions all the people from around the world who join the elected government's forces...why did they come?

So...as a drama about a father and son...the movie does succeed to some extent.  As a historical piece, it fails.  If the intent was to extol the early live of the founder of Opus Dei...not so good.  A secondary theme that becomes the standard chase scene of his followers trying to protect and hide him from a government that was upset with priests for no apparent reason.",1465344000,,1259,4.741935483870968

4499901,3,B004YJZB4S,"Two different stories held together by a tenuous thread.  The part about about the priest was obviously a puff piece about a controversial man.  The other part of the movie concerning the ""father"" and son was actually very good.  It is the father/son dynamic that this film gets an overall rating of 3.  If you want slanted puff piece about the founder of Opus Dei, you found it here.",1463616000,,384,4.521739130434782

A writer (Dougray Scott) is assigned to write a story about Josemaria Escriva (Charlie Cox), a priest being considered by the Catholic church for sainthood. While he has been estranged from his father for eight years he is traveling back to Spain and asks his father about Josemaria.  He is astounded by what he learns.  His father and the priest, it turns out, were childhood friends and he learns of the very different directions their lives took after they were in the seminary together.

4499947,5,B004YJZB4S,"""There Be Dragons"" is strikingly similar to ""For Greater Glory"" in that both feature persecution of the Catholic Church during a time of civil war. Also, there is a focus on conflicted characters, each with one notable exception. ""For Greater Glory"" showcases the martyrdom of the saintly youth Jose Sanchez del Rio and ""There Be Dragons"" tells of the early life of the (nearly martyred) priest Josemaria Escriva, founder of Opus Dei. Little had I known that the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s was as bad for the Catholic Church in Spain as the suppression of the Cristero revolt was for the Mexican Church. On the other hand, some differences between the films do stand out. In ""For Greater Glory,"" the politically active ""good guys"" resort to violence, while Fr. Escriva shuns all violence. ""Dragons"" narrator Manolo takes ""many wrong turns"" in life, descending into the violent abyss of both major factions (fascist and communist), but he never betrays his old friend Josemaria. Such loyalty is rewarded at the end. Fr. Dennis",1406937600,4,1029,4.953757225433526

The only reason that this major motion picture by the celebrated director of The Mission and The Killing Fields hasn't received the attention it deserves is that one of its central figures is a Catholic priest.

Civil wars bring out the best and worst in people, and this movie takes a look at this. Without flinching and without manipulating our emotions with its cinematography (as in the worthy but manipulative Schindler's List) we are asked to see the good and bad in both the good and bad. Ultimately it invites us to heal the wounds of the past, not because they can be forgiven, but because we can't condemn others without condemning ourselves as well.

4499990,5,B004YJZB4S,What caught my attention was the title.  I first thought it was a movie about dragons.  I saw the ratings and decided to watch it.  A great movie about love and forgiveness.  The acting was first rate and I could sympathize with the characters.  Very enlightening about the civil war in Spain.  Behind it all is the friendship of the two main characters.  They took different paths and each had to fight the dragons within.  Very tragic story of one of the two friends.  One who was eventually canonized as a saint and the other that tried to redeem himself at the end of his life.  What I would have like was more of what happened to father Jose Maria after he escaped over the mountains to eventually found Opus Dei.  All in all I would highly recommend this movie.,1390953600,,767,4.4071428571428575

But there be dragons is much more, it is a very neutral look at our war, which is not expected to arouse old hatreds but well otherwise preaches forgiveness, which is the central theme of the entire film there lies the entire message.
Where everyone isn't bad or all good, which is welcome.
We follow the childhood and youth of 2 friends Joseph Mara Escriv and Manuel Torres very different between them since the provincial Spain to Spain in war and look at the different ways that take both.
The script is very good as well as the direction, outstanding performances, as well as the technical aspects, photography, sound, soundtrack, costume... etc.
Film that can be enjoyed equally whether you're religious or not.
I for example am not and is already among my favorites.

The only part I remember is the beginning of the father's childhood story and also the meaning of the title, ""There Be Dragons,"" which frankly, if you're not paying attention, you'd never catch that cool little part.
The rest of it had great acting, but the story was kind of bland. Maybe that's just me...",1388880000,,410,4.554054054054054
4500013,5,B004YJZB4S,"So, a while back I saw this title and thought it sounded interesting, then I read that it was about historical people during the Spanish Civil War.  I knew I had to watch it sooner or later.  It was totally worth the watch.  The three main characters are a reporter in the ""present"", a dead priest, and a dying soldier.
Thematically, I loved the film.  The man who would become a priest and the man who would become a soldier were introduced as children.  One child learns early to forgive.  The other learns only to cast blame and consequently struggles throughout his side of the story.  Forgiveness is described as a gift to oneself, and in a way it is, but it is even so much more.  It is part of the ""divine flavour"" that is brought about with, ""patience, skill, hard work, and love.""
Visually, the film held my attention and made the time come alive.  It was gritty, but not to excess.  It was beautiful, but not in a way that was out of place.  (One of the most beautiful scenes to me was a tear falling in the dark on the face of a statue of the Virgin Mary that was fallen amid rubble and the light of morning that then broke through).

I've never seen a movie about the Spanish revolution and this one was thrilling, scary, romantic and based (loosely?) on fact about a priest who is now a saint.

The movie follows two parallel lives of childhood friends with different values, hopes and ambitions.
The Spanish Civil War was arguably the most idealogical war of the last century.  This film gives a flavor of that, with foreigners volunteering for one side or the other - difficult to see that happening today: have we lost our idealism??

I am not going to comment its plot or its deep meaning because it has been said enough about them in these comments. I want to talk about the film language.
Some call it CINEMATOGRAPHY, but the term, is not right, since the way the camera moves, the angles and the light design are ultimately the director's decision.
The opening shot is out of this world! I frankly don't know how they did it, starting as it did in the outside, going in through the window, going into close ups and finally down to the Priest's body on the ground. Can't think of anything else than an overhead rail, type Antonioni's The Passenger. At the same time, it has the look of a very steady hand camera.
His fade overs are not merely an editing artifice, but expressive, poetic means of expression.
Besides the cinematographer, the camera operator must be commanded since the difficult camera movements have not a single glitch.

4500072,2,B004YJZB4S,"I guess that I can't say a whole lot about this film, mostly because I turned it off after a little over an hour of waiting for something interesting to happen in this nearly unbearable snooze-fest of a film. It's understandable that there are quite a few people that were and continue to be inspired by the work of St. Josemaria Escriva and Opus Dei during the Spanish Civil War, but I felt that the message, however inspired, was lost in a mire of confusing narrative structure, uncertain motivations, and sketchy characterization. Roland Joffe used to be able to make great films in his sleep, with great and powerful films like THE MISSION and THE KILLING FIELDS, but after those films, he made the so-bad-it's-good adaptation of THE SCARLET LETTER with Demi Moore, GOODBYE, LOVER, which is a terrible attempt at steamy neo-noir, and the worst of the lot is his bizarre move into psychological torture horror with CAPTIVITY.

I do have to say that the main reason that I decided to see this film was for Wes Bentley. Since he showed such promise and skill over a decade ago with his major film debut as Ricky Fitts in Sam Mendes' brilliant AMERICAN BEAUTY. Since then, though, plagued by poor career choices and serious struggles with addiction, I've been dying to see him in something good. But truly awful films like GHOST RIDER, P2, and JONAH HEX have done nothing to try to put him back into a career worthy of his talents. I was hoping that this would be a film where I would start to see a glimmer of the promise he showed back then. Sadly, this was not it.

Firstly, I was confused why we had a bunch of British, American and Austrailian actors playing Spaniards. That's something that so often puzzles and bothers me. I know that the urge to anglicanize films about foreign lands is powerful from a potential box office appeal standpoint, but is so often unnecessary, primarily because every country in the world has great actors and performers that can speak the language and be as good (if not better) than any of the performers in most films, but also because the accents, more often than not, become far too distracting. At least they had room for Rodrigo Santoro in the film as Oriol. Charlie Cox is decent as Escriva, but the character seems far too... happy and confident for the explosive events erupting all around him. Even more lost is Bentley as Manolo Torres, who never really seems to find his footing, especially in the unbelievably bad ""old man"" makeup. For God's sakes, almost 30 years ago, someone was able to successfuly turn F. Murray Abraham into an incredibly convincing old man in 1984's AMADEUS, but they couldn't find someone who could do it now when people are creating zombies and werewolves and bizarre creatures at every FX shop in the world? Dougray Scott seems to be sleepwalking here. The only performance I was enjoying was that of Sir Derek Jacobi, and he had about six minutes of screentime.

I know that I don't really have a whole lot to say that's a reasonable review of the entirety of this film, but my impression of THERE BE DRAGONS is the first act is so plodding and messy that I can't see how it might have improved.",1340755200,5,3172,4.620567375886525

4500080,4,B004YJZB4S,"Don't rent THERE BE DRAGONS thinking you'll be watching some dungeons and dragons item. It has nothing to do with fantasy worlds or actual dragons.

The movie is the true story of Josemaria Escriva, founder of Opus Dei. This group may sound familiar to you as it was used in the Dan Brown book/movie THE DAVINCI CODE. But it seems that truth is more interesting than fiction as we find out what it was all about. Also don't think this movie is a boring recitation of religious ideology, far from it.

Taking place in Spain Dougray Scott plays a journalist looking into the life of Escriva for an article he's writing. When his father, Judge Manolo, learns of this, he calls for him and provides him with information Scott never realized he had. It seems that his father and Escriva grew up together in the same small town in Spain.

The two began as boyhood chums but financial ruin made Escriva's family a pariah to that of Manolo. Later they have a run in at the seminary they both attend but make amends. Their lives then take to very different paths that one would think would never cross again. Instead, their lives cross at moments more important than anyone might ever know.

Manolo (Wes Bentley) works with his father's company and takes on the attitude of royalty when it comes to his workers. While many are complaining and threatening strikes, influenced by the Communists viewpoints becoming popular, he continues to see himself as the person in charge who can do as he wishes. Things change with time and the factory closes but he retains his wealth and position. Manolo eventually offers his services to the military who have tried to take over the country, going undercover with the subversives who want to have Communist rule.

At the same time Escriva (Charlie Cox) has become a priest, but one without enlightenment it seems. When he asks for direction from God, he receives it and then approaches his superiors with the idea he feels God sent to him. It is this idea that begins the formation of the group known as Opus Dei. But rather than be depicted as fanatical murderers we are presented with an order that follows the guidelines of everyday people uniting to worship and to follow God's word through their daily lives. Each person involved follows the same rules that priests would follow without being ordained. Escriva believes that in this way all can become closer to God.

The problem with Escriva though is one that involves the church during the Spanish Civil War that is going on around them. The subversives want nothing to do with the Catholic Church, going so far as to kill priests in the streets. Escriva's group must meet behind closed doors, worshipping but not openly.

While this is going on Manolo has infiltrated the subversives. He routinely sends information via radio to the military which disrupts much of which these fighters set out to accomplish. While undercover he also falls in love with one of the female fighter who wants nothing to do with him. She shares herself with the leaders and most fierce fighters, but holds back from Manolo. It just makes her more alluring to him.

These two divergent paths must cross at some time and they do. But not before we witness the reality of who these two men really are, the acts they perform for their different beliefs and how their world changes around them.

Director Roland Joffe has been connected with movies that take on the ideas of God and man in many forms, most notable with THE MISSION and THE KILLING FIELDS. Here he once again provides an outsiders view, a look that neither encourages nor dissuades the beliefs of the viewer. Instead we have an open minded look at a topic that is rather touchy for most.

As I said at the start, the movie might sound stuffy if all you heard about was Opus Dei and the Spanish Civil War. But after watching it made me more interested in both topics. You'll find yourself surfing the web looking for info on both or seeking out reading material. And the movie itself will hold your interest from start to finish. Well made, well directed and well acted, it should have been and Oscar contender. My guess is when the subject matter of God came into play it was unofficially disqualified. Their loss perhaps but your gain should you decide to watch.",1332806400,45,4292,4.665343915343915

I didn't find it particularly inspiring either. The ending wasn't bad, in light of the rest of the film, but also wasn't great.

If you're considering watching this movie because you want to learn about St. Josemaria Escriva or Opus Dei, or you want to give it to someone as a gift because they're interested in one or the other (barring they've requested it,of course) , I advise you look elsewhere as there's not much info. on either in this film.",1332288000,5,606,4.663551401869159
4500082,3,B004YJZB4S,"This film is `inspired by true events', and as such takes quite a lot of poetic licence, and leaves out probably a bit too much especially from the aspect of the Church's involvement. The story begins with Robert, a journalist, (Dougray Scott) being asked to investigate the life of Jose Maria Escriva (Charlie Cox), as he is about to be Canonised. He discovers that his estranged father went to the same seminary as him and so uses it as an excuse to reconnect with his dying patriarch.

The story then starts to be told in flash back and we start around 1911 when the two boys were friends. It turns out that his father knows a lot more than most and all of their lives are sort of intertwined. The real story takes place during The Spanish Civil War (1936 -39) where Manolo (Roberts dad played by Wes Bentley) gets involved with both sides in the fighting.

The story of the War is told in tandem with that of Jose Maria as he becomes the modern founder of Opus Dei and does charitable works and faces many threats; being a Priest he is particularly susceptible to summary execution at the hands of the Republicans/Communists/Socialists/Anarchists or what ever you want to call the legitimate Government.

This is written and directed by Roland Joffe (`The Mission' and `The Killing Fields') and had a fairly big budget that was actually quite well spent. The battle scenes are effective, with good CGI where it is used. The direction is excellent and the acting is all above par. But the narrative drives this and as ever there are some stretches of belief required a couple of times. To say any more would be a plot spoiler. It is also just over two hours long, but it does not feel like a long film and I thought it ended quite quickly as I was up for more. So despite the flaws this is really rather good as entertainment. Despite the subject matter this is all in English, although there are attempts at Spanish accents. There are a couple of cameos from Charles Dance and Derek Jacobi too.

This is not be Joffe's best film but is far from being a bad one. If you are an historically accurate fan there will be things to take issue with, and indeed has stirred up quite a few emotion so much so I have revised my star rating to reflect that for some the historical holes are just too much of a deal breaker.",1331769600,8,2316,4.442352941176471

4500086,3,B004YJZB4S,"I did not care for this movie at all.  For me, the movie was hard to follow because three of the main characters that you see the most of, all look similar.  Each one having dark hair, dark eyes, familiar sounding voice, and after five facial hair.  Blame it on my eyes maybe.  The movie also takes several odd twists and turns and is told by two different people at very random times, which also contributed to me having such a hard time following the story.  And the story isn't real clear about how or when they decide to switch viewpoints.  The cinematography was nice, but the writing was not real put together, which gave it several instances of confusion.  Surprisingly, aside from a few of the actors, the acting was not real great either.  The movie, while supposedly being based on the Opus Dei, didn't explain or dig any deeper into it.  It was just mentioned a few times in passing.  Also, while the movie states that a man is researching a priest who has ties to his father, the two didn't really cross paths that much.  So it really doesn't seem to carry the movie as the sole storyline.

What I did like about the movie, was just when I thought I knew what was going to happen or what did happen, I would find I wasn't right about it at all.  In that aspect it really did keep you guessing and wondering.  The end, although obvious once revealed, took me by surprise as well.  There was also a scene (possible *Spoiler Alert*) where a beautiful, glowing, young lady, discusses her disbelief and possibly the priests disbelief as well, for God.  She talks about ""Him"" not hearing their prayers and how its hard to believe in ""Him"" afterall.  I find this to be quite a comparison to the devil tempting the priest into turning away from God. It appears that this girl is a vision that comes to him in his depths of despair.

*Parental Concerns*
Its a war movie and so there is language.  I wouldn't consider this a kids movie anyway but for those who like to know.....There are several instances of language. B!**h, S*!t, A**, He**, Dam*, OMG.

Of course lots of explosions, destruction, blood, and war scenes.

4500089,2,B004YJZB4S,"All you need to know about this film can be discerned in the fact of the cover art (front and back) for the DVD case being images of, no, not Josemara Escriv, the Roman Catholic priest from Spain who founded Opus Dei, nor the journalist played by actor Dougray Scott, but instead the images are of a left-wing militia leader named Oriol fighting to uphold a communist ""republic"". The story of Josemara Escriv and everybody else in this epic, excepting Oriol and his lover (played by Olga Kurylenko), are really just the background against which screenwriter and director Roland Joff plays out the real drama and message of this film - that drama being the holy crusade of world-wide socialism to wipe right-wingers, capitalists and reactionaries from from the face of the earth; a crusade Joffe carries forward in this film.

""The coming world war will cause not only reactionary classes and dynasties, but entire reactionary peoples, to disappear from the face of the earth. And that will be progress."" - Friedrich Engels

Leftists worldwide love to use the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop to communicate surreptitious support for socialism/communism - at the time, and to this day, Leftists understand the Spanish Civil War to have been a dramatic and romantic clash (prelude to the worldwide clash) of the forces of good (Leftism/Communism/Socialism) verses the forces of evil (anybody with political leanings right-of-center). If you understand this, then you will understand the reason this film was made, and why it is nothing more than propaganda masquerading as historical epic.",1330300800,3,1586,5.096153846153846

4500091,5,B004YJZB4S,"Although the true nature of St. Josemaria's magnetic personality and absolute faith in God are almost impossible to ""re-create"", Joffe nade his fictional history vivid enough to make someone unfamiliar with the incredible life of the man want to learn more about him. As someone with devotion to the saint, I was looking for these points more than I had, perhaps, a right to do. I liked the film very much and was looking to something more like the ""Mission"" he did about the Jesuits in South America. That film I gladly watch again whenever I can. This film, too, will be in the category, but a bit lower on my list. I recommend the film to anyone who wants to consider the life of this humble and devout priest who believed that even the simplest worker by his or her giving that work a supernatural or transcendent value could attain to holiness, heaven and sainthood. It is a refreshing work in days when people need hope. It is very much a film for anyone to enjoy.",1329523200,4,970,4.4858757062146895
4500092,1,B004YJZB4S,"The movie was awefully pretentious and full of historical lies.
Uncivilized left wing unionists, barbaric republican troops, well meaning right wing military, and a clergy floating in higher sheres,
give me a break. The reality was quite diffrent:
The clergy openly supported fascism, even asking Hitler and Mussolini for support and at the time were still apologetic about their Conquest of Latin America.
I loved the Directors ""The Killing Fields"" ""The Mission ""as one of the best movies I've seen.
I didn't expect to be led into such a movie fiasco, by an director iI used to keep in high esteem.
Also the portrait of two protagonist characters, living  under such incredible human stress, failed to convince me about their actions in the film.
The acting was shallow and the scenes loaded with klischees.
Also if you are not familiar with the spanisch civil war, like most viewers will be, how could he possibly believe that such a complex and stirring conflict could be understood by an unsuspecting audience.
Realistically, this is two movies. One about the writer and his father. One about Opus Dei. The two stories are related by the thinnest of threads and the relation doesn't actually need to be there at all.
I think the story about father and son, Monolo and Robert, would have been worth pursuing in more depth. The reason behind their rift is only alluded to and not explored terribly well, and their spontaneous reconciliation at the end felt forced. Deus ex machina. Perhaps a bit literally.
Meanwhile, the story about Josemaria Escriva -- I can't understand why Joffe didn't show him walking on water as he did just about everything else. I found that this felt like a really nice public relations piece for Opus Dei. I guess the Church and Joffe felt they'd taken enough hits from Dan Brown and needed some positive spin.
-----
Of what I write now, is in response to the negative feedback I seem to catch, therefore I like to clarify a few points, to enforce my opinion:
First of all, this movie polarizes viewers, you either love it or hate it.
I hate it, because i believe it is trying to rewrite history. I'm not gonna tolerate lies.
I watched this movie with the hope, that it would reconcile the catholic church at the time of the spanish civil war.
Like other very good movies have done:
La Forja de un rebelde, LIBERTARIAS, LAND AND FREEDOM, Five Cartridges (Fnf Patronenhlsen) (1965).
And than there is another movie, that will be posted soon : Los jinetes de Alba, another movie about the spanish civil war, and the catholic church, from a spanish director.
The spanish have produced quite a view movies and tv miniseries during the last few years, trying to reconcile this tragic period.
The catholic church of spain was well behind in times that concerned women's rights. Intellectual spanish women felt marginalized and deeply discriminated under their clerical authorities.
They deeply felt a war waged against them. The spanish republic changed all that in the 1936 election, and transported spain into the age of modern civil rights.
When the spanish military, supported by the facist leader Mussolini, and the nazi leader Adolf Hitler, staged their coup de etat, the catholic church did not hesitate, to put their support
behind the spanish fascist military, with their leader Franco. There are documents that the clergy did not even hesitate do go behind their call of duty, even took on arms against their flocks.
Now, I wonder why the director of this film, gets away without mentioning any of this ?",1329350400,11,3538,4.847933884297521

I still wonder why was this movie so scantly present in the movie theaters. It is a must see jewel.
The story may irk many so called liberal minds (not so liberal after all) because it presents in its crude reality what happened in Spain prior and during the civil war of 1936. Catholics were being butchered by the so called ""Popular Front"" a ""liberal"" organization that brought down Spain, socially, economically, morally, and literally.

4500096,5,B004YJZB4S,"THERE BE DRAGONS is a film based on the saying 'Here be dragons' - a phrase used to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the medieval practice of putting sea serpents and other mythological creatures in uncharted areas of maps. Why this exceptional film did not appeal to theater audiences is possibly due to the fact of the release of another, animated film with a similar title (How to Train Your Dragon), and perhaps the title lead audiences astray.  That would be unfortunate because this true background story about the canonization of Josemar&iacute;a Escriv&aacute; (9 January 1902 - 26 June 1975) - a Roman Catholic priest from Spain who founded Opus Dei, an organization of laypeople and priests dedicated to the teaching that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity. He was canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II, who declared Saint Josemar&iacute;a should be `counted among the great witnesses of Christianity'.

Roland Joff&eacute; (`The Mission', `The Killing Fields', `The  Scarlet Letter', `Vatel' etc) wrote and directed this film that revisits the Spanish Civil War and the events leading up to that war, the confusion about communism, fascism, anarchy, and republic that divided a country for years. A young journalist Robert (Dougray Scott) long ago rejected by his now aged and dying father Manolo (Wes Bentley) finds himself investigating one of his father's former friends, Josemaria (Charlie Cox) who is a candidate for canonization. Uncovering the two men's complicated relationship from childhood through the horrors of the Spanish Civil War unveils a compelling drama filled with passion, betrayal, love and religion. An action packed story set during a murderous time in history that ultimately serves the present by revealing the importance and timeless power of forgiveness. Manolo and Josemaria were childhood friends who joined the seminary to become priests: Manolo gave up the priesthood to embrace the outside Spanish Civil War while Josemaria felt called by God to form the Opus Dei, protecting his people and challenging the forces of evil that battled outside the church. Manolo falls under the spell of a beautiful Hungarian girl Ildiko (Olga Kurylenko) who is a freedom fighter who in turn has fallen in love with a leader of the revolution Oriol (Rodrigo Santoro). While the three fight the battle Manolo becomes a mole and is ultimately responsible for the death of Oriol and Ildiko.  The secret that Robert, years later, is investigating as he writes a book about Josemaria reflects years of anguish that is resolved as Robert's father (Manolo) reveals the true history of his life on his deathbed.

The writing for the film is shaky - there are many sidebars that are never explained and the conversations among the characters feel strained.  The actors are superb and do manage to bring to life palpable character.  Some fine supporting roles are well managed by Geraldine Chaplin, Jordi Moll&agrave;. Golshifteh Farahani, Derek Jacobi, Lily Cole, Unax Ugalde, Charles Dance, Ana Torrent and others.  The film does indeed give a fine reenactment of the realities of the Spanish Civil War, a murderous time in history that ultimately serves the present by revealing the importance and timeless power of forgiveness. The film in general bears the stamp of the fine work of director Roland Joff&eacute;. Grady Harp, January 12",1326585600,10,3426,5.171480144404332
4500097,1,B004YJZB4S,I really wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to it base on the previous reviews.  The writing is just dreadful.

4500098,5,B004YJZB4S,"Because cinemas in this area dismissed this one as ""very limited release,"" it's been a long wait.  It was worth waiting.

This is the story of two childhood friends who take different life paths that cross during the Spanish Civil War.  When one is proposed for sainthood in the 1970's, the son of the other begins research to write a book about him.  An old picture links his father to the dead priest for the first time, and the writer begins digging into the story, finding that ""there be dragons"" in the past.

The movie is a mix of pshychological/spiritual with the action of a bloody war, and the ending is one very few would guess.",1326326400,111,638,4.4655172413793105
4500099,1,B004YJZB4S,"The movie begins with an interesting shot of Escriva's death --as he slips from his desk, knocking papers, the tumbling objects freeze in mid air and we are left with a kind of 3D icon of the saint's final moment.  However from that initial scene on the movie is almost completely downhill.  There are a few moments of inspiring visuals and occasional spirited performances (Derek Jacobi, for one) but everything is marred by a terrible script that tries to make a kind of Citizen Kane type mystery out of the life of a saint.

The film is told through two parrallel stories --one contemporary about a man investigating Escriva's connection to his own father (as he writes a biography of Escriva), and the other is the tory of Escriva and the Spanish civil war.

The story of the writer and his father is a total train wreck.  The story of Escriva and Spanish politics is kind of interesting but seems to take backseat to the trainwreck.  The dialog in these contemporary scenes is so weak and artificial that it becomes a test of the audience's patience just to sit through it in hopes of a little more of the other story.

Sadly this movie will probably put an end to any serious interest in making a film about Escriva and the Opus Dei movement he fostered. And that seems almost unforgivable.",1324512000,22,1296,4.584415584415584

It is full of truly unpredictable twists and turns, and lots of hidden meaning and purpose.

I have heard criticism that St. Josemaria Escriva was not featured enough, and the focus was too much on the alternate character, Manolo.  I disagree.

But how much this movie reflects the life and work of Josemaria Escriva or the Spanish Civil War is something different.  In this film we never really see what inspired Escriva's unique vision, other than experiences thousands also endured, or why his Opus Dei movement should have become a social power in Franquista Spain and Latin America.  There are great production values - the time and place are meticulously recreated, as well as the surging passions of civil war Spain.  Unfortunately, films about the Spanish civil war rarely do well at the box office, and this one promotes the ""acceptable"" view as portrayed in a noble priest fleeing Red vengeance.  Lost in this mainstream, feel-good revisionism is the overwhelmingly brutality of the ""Catholic side,"" as clergy from bishops on down justified near-genocidal massacres that had nothing to do with the film's redeeming message.  (See Paul Preston's ""The Spanish Holocaust."")
