3564161,1,B001F42PPI,This is just one of those comics on dvd. Idid not know that is what it was. The story is good. As all the street fighter without live action are. It looks like they are just blowing this up frame by frame. If you like comics read to you by dvd this is your product if not buy ths book.,1238630400,3,285,3.7666666666666666

3564163,4,B001F42PPI,"This is my first experience with animated comics. The art is spectacular. There is a fair amount of animation, such as a character flying across the screen when he kicks, debris flying around, or Ryu's headband waving in the air. The characters' mouths don't move though. Still, thanks to the option to watch it with or without voice bubbles, this is practically like watching a cartoon. The story is very mature and well-written, much better than any of the Street Fighter animes in my opinion. Characters from Street Fighter 2, 4, and Alpha all make appearances.

My one major criticism is the voice acting. The actors are all terrible and they mispronounce virtually every name and special move (Gouken's name sounding the worst). Ken's wife Eliza has been given a phony southern accent for no discernible reason, but at least her voice actor is actually a female. If I had to choose between the animated Watchmen comic's single voice actor or a bunch of crummy voice actors, I'd go with Street Fighter's janitors, I mean actors. The sound effects and music are good, thankfully.

I recommend this for people who want to see the comic brought to life or just Street Fighter fans in general.",1236384000,4,1193,4.814634146341463

Now for my review. (First ever Review)

The story line was good.  Animated comics seem pretty good.  But without the animation I used to do this as a kid to my friends.  They just added the animation and had more than one voice.  I know that some complained about the pronunciations.  But I will say it did better than me.

The good, Comics animated for our viewing pleasure.  Some voices match the charactors.  And for those who played Street Fighter 2 The New Challangers for the SNES.  Well we saw how some of the charactors storyline progressed.

The bad, lack of moving lips (but this was a comic afterall) Some voices did not match their Charactors (Vega for example did not sound Spanish) I would have prefered to see it without Chapter sceen popping up now and then.  Straight through would have been great.",1250640000,2,989,4.446927374301676
