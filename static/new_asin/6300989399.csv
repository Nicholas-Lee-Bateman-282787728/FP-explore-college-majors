You're here for Pierre Kirby and don't kid yourself. He appears for a total of about ten minutes total sporting a sweet floral shirt and a thirst for ass kicking! The highlight here is the flip he does in the last 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie is hard to follow and has something to do with a kidnapping, I've seen it 3 times already and still don't really know. Buy it for the epic box cover, Pierre, and the fact that you'll be able to boast about owning it to random people that probably won't even know what your talking about.",1438732800,,720,4.113475177304965
