With all the major crap that T.V. mostly has to offer and with the almost instant release of this crap to DVD it is no wonder that the tension of getting real, true ""Quality"" released is very palpable. Not since Freaks and Geeks has there been such noise about a DVD, in this case since season one was released over 2 years ago with a promise of season 2 coming soon?

Unfortunately, that is not going to happen. There is some kind of copyright protection that only allows the DVDs to be viewed on an actual DVD player, not a computer. I even got IT involved and that's what I was told. I just recently got a new computer and IT suggested I bring the DVDs back to the office again just in case.

There is no ""play all"" option, but instead, you must constantly select the episode, then the chapter and you spend most of the time having to continue to do so.

I've really enjoyed seeing these shows again, and will enjoy them for years to come.  The dvds are good quality, and if you appreciate good television well done, it's definitely worth the price.  Love MTM!",1414627200,,422,4.573333333333333

2268432,4,B00096S480,"The MTM show was one of the most mature comedies ever aired.  It handled important questions in life in an adult way, and that is a rare commodity.  Mary Tyler Moore was no beautiful comedian, like say my favorite Christina Applegate: she(MTM) was more a 'straight man' setting up jokes and scenes for clowns such as Ted Baxter or the other supporting actors (including our favorite: Bette White).  Unlike many comedies that you might buy and just watch once, this series can be watched, put aside for awhile and then re-watched with the same enjoyment.
The show had a political undertone that many saw, but many did not.  Mary, we are led to believe, has decided to not jump at the first marriage proposal.  Now, whether this was true, or wise, is not crystal clear.  What is clear is that this number one show had a large influence on a generation, some of whom, like Mary, delayed, deferred, and even cancelled, what was a traditional life.  Whether that was a 'good influence' is very much open to debate, something beyond the scope of a simple review.",1401321600,,1056,4.645161290322581

Great clear, if not brilliant, color and sound and the English subtitles are a big plus. However, face colors are a little too red during scenes at WJM-TV. I won't bother to post this review again. If we Amazon customers don't RAVE over all the products you sell us, you just up and delete the reviews? Well, my oh my, I don't understand. I'm RECOMMENDING this Season 2 DVD.

Failing that, I decided to mail this book back to you which I have had now for some two years. Has your summer thus far been going well? I just back from a trip home to Pennsylvania which was nice and relaxing. Hope it lasts for more than a few days after I go back to work. I have sent a couple of emails to Cindy, but have not heard back from her. Do you know what she is up to recently? Give me a call sometime, if you get the chance. Love you always MSLBF of course this was supposed to be for your birthday. When I last talked to you and you told me about your mom, ya said before you hung up, ""pray for us"" I hope that you realize how serious I take a statement like that. You know how much you and your family means to me. I love the girls like they were my own and your mom has many times been a mom to me. you are more a sister to me than my own_not to discount Joy. You are in my prayers without asking. But when you ask surely you know that my prayer is greatly a desire to discredit matter and see only spiritual reality. I'm not sure this is what you were asking for. I don't know how to respond to your view of matter except to say that I'm quite sure that God knows nothing of your life but that reflection of spiritual goodness and with holiness ever present. I want nothing more than to see that understood and demonstrated. So I just want you to know that if I share with you an idea of divine Science it is not a disrespect of your thoughts, it is the only way I know how to respond. When I think of your family I see a wonderful committment to honesty, a genuine love for life and a devotion to doing what is right, a natural receptivity to goodness. I don't see anything but good. Now you may try to convince Me otherwise butI think when the dust settles all you are going to see is love. There is too much love present, I'm your family for it and all that it includes not to be seen. You say that your mother is in good spirits. That strength of spirit is divine Love's presence--holding her and caring for her. As much love she has showered on you and you have showered on your children, that much and more is ours and God's children. Think about what that means-Daughter-Mother LOVE, Protection,guidance,comfort. Happy Thanksgiving! All that is love, ash",1378339200,,2878,4.196750902527076

It was a truly funny sitcom which became more crazy with each season. So i have five more seasons to go. If you grew up in the golden age of television , all of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Thank you Mary for making us laugh and making it after all !!!.",1339200000,,416,3.9058823529411764
2268452,5,B00096S480,"Mary Richards was like the perky high school freshman in season one, finding her way in her new school (WJM) and making friends.  In her sophomore season, she's comfortable in her surroundings, better at her job and has closer friendships.  She evolves and yet...she does it in a perky way - that way that makes women want to be her and men want to date her.

As Mary's dates and friendships come into focus, it's appropriate that the first episode is called ""The Birds...And ...Um...Bees.""  And while Rhoda describes Mary as the girl sprinkled with fairy dust in life & dating, she is not without her dating woes:  a lackluster setup from Mr. Grant, a fake date with Ted Baxter, a high school boyfriend (played by Valerie Harper's husband at the time, Richard Schaal) who won't go away and a man too busy to get their dates started.

The heart and soul of the 1971/72 season, though, is the closeness between Mary and Rhoda.  It's a vital aspect of this series - always funny and often comforting; we count on it the way we count on that ""M"" to always be there on the wall.  While season one started with Rhoda being hostile that Mary ""stole"" her apartment, they became friends anyway.  Now, they are like family - in and out of each other's apartments, vacationing together and dealing with men - and with all of those dates, one perfect match came out of it...the Mary and Rhoda friendship.

There are 24 episodes, featuring some greats; such as ""Cover Boy,"" where Ted's competitive brother (played by Jack Cassidy) visits and takes out Rhoda in a double date that pairs Ted with Mary.  ""Thoroughly Unmilitant Mary"" is a classic that has Mary and Mr. Grant running the newsroom when the newswriters go on strike.  Ed Asner as a drunk Mr. Grant reading the news is priceless.  These scenes established Asner and MTM as a great comic duo.

The DVD quality is excellent and offers great extras:  Among those - two documentaries about the show, Emmy award clips and the theme song karaoke track.

More of Moore is always good, and season two is magnificent with a capital ""M"".",1331769600,,2075,4.613079019073569

Season Two finds the WJM newsroom staff developing their styles. Ted is still annoying (but Lou can't let him go no matter what) and Murray and Mary continue to develop their friendship. The episodes are always funny especially when Ted is forced to take a vacation only to find out his temporary ""replacement"" has WJM's ratings going sky high.

2268471,5,B00096S480,"Although the show ran throughout the '70s, its appeal is still lasting today, in the story of Mary Richards and her eclectic co-workers in the WJM newsroom...

In the pilot, 30-year-old Mary has just moved to Minneapolis, eager to start a new life as a single careerwoman after her breakup with her fiance. She answers an ad seeking a secretary, and finds herself associate producer of the six o'clock news at WJM. There, she works for Lou Grant, a tough guy with a soft exterior and a ready bottle of booze, and alongside kindhearted news writer Murray and self-centered, idiotic reporter Ted Baxter.

On the home front, Mary decides to rent an apartment in the home of her college friend Phyllis Lindstrom...incurring the wrath of New York native Rhoda Morgenstern, who had her heart set on moving in. Despite their rocky start, the two opposite personalities quickly become best friends, creating the basis for much of the show's humor.

In Season 2, several episodes center around Bess, Phyllis' precocious adolescent daughter; Mary's dating hijinks; newsroom mishaps; and visits from Rhoda's stereotypically Jewish mother.

2268473,5,B00096S480,"In the golden years of Television - indeed in the golden years of Entertainment  - quality was important. Performers on TV had honed their skills, during years of endeavour in halls and theatres across the country, perfecting their work. Musicians - of all forms of music - played proper instruments with virtuoso ability. Lyrics could be understood and the musical sound replicated  - because it was written down and 'scored'. Actors, musicians, dancers, etc., all had 'great ability'.

Even in this milieu, some performers stood out as exceptional. When thoroughly competent TV directors and skilled television technicians were able to work with these outstanding performers, shows  of exceptional quality and were produced.

Mary Tyler Moore had an ability and an aura about her that was rare. The 'situation comedy', a long cherished and much loved TV art-form, seemed to have been made for her and her many skills. Moore's first great TV success was in the Dick Van Dyke Show. Then, when she starred in her own shows, Moore was magnificent.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show was produced and directd by consumate experts. Add to this a particularly high standing of casting, which ensured only the best supporting actors,and the Mary Tyler Moore Show was destined to be in the 'Top Flight' of its gendre.

Importantly however, unlike the crass and peurile content of so much 'entertainment' today, the Mary Tyler Moore Show ( and other great shows of the era) contained no gratuitous violence, no explicit sex or nudity, and no foul or blasphemous language. The show was humourous without being coarse and was, truly, a delight to watch.",1162684800,7,1635,5.033333333333333

2268475,5,B00096S480,"The first season was very, very good, but occasionally got waylaid by its tendency to give too much screen time to a guest star (who often wasn't all that funny).  This season MTM and crew figured out that it was the relationships with her co-workers and with ""the girls"" (Rhoda, and to a lesser extent, Phyllis) that made this show what it was--smart, real, funny, and, for its time, a little bit cutting edge.

Valerie Harper and Ed Asner are incredible--these two deliver every line in such a way that you forget they're acting.  Their achievement almost made me forget about Mary, who came into her own as a comedian in this show.  Mary does it a little more quietly than Rhoda, but she, too, is very, very good.  Her physical and facial schtick are excellent, and often subtle.  When super-nice Mary goes against her character and angrily asks Rhoda if Rhoda might have the spare key to the apartment upstairs, it's really funny.

The only things that ever slow this show down are guest stars and a weak premise. Yes, there are still a few ""clunkers,"" but even those have moments that outshine almost every other show, because the cast is always perfect (guest stars excepted). And what other show can give you biting media-savvy satire and real, heartfelt relationships at the same time?

I know this was to save money (though the savings aren't exactly passed on to the consumer), but the result is that season two looks pretty cheesy in its box on the shelf next to season one.

It's especially lame to have to flip over disc three to get to some of the extras (something I didn't even realize until I read it in a review here -- the packaging only mentions it in tiny print).

The studio clearly does not realize what kind of gem they have here. If they were to keep the seasons coming -- and keep the quality of the packaging up -- they would certainly find ever-growing sales of ALL seasons as people get reaquainted with just how good this show really was.

When I was in high school and college I watched Mary on Nick at Night whenever I got a chance.  I started to appreciate the show for its showing of the progression of women in the workplace, but still showed where women hadn't gotten to be complete equals to men. Also it was funny!  Now that I am nearly 30 and a career-woman I crave to watch Mary again - as she was in her 30's in the show.

Needless to say, I can't wait until the remaining seasons get released, and I hope I am not 40 by the time that happens!

The show is great for all ages, which you can't say about many shows made now.

The additional features on the disc leave something to be desired in comparison to other TV series on DVD, however I suppose there may not be a lot of old MTM tape lying around to make extras like bloopers or deleted scenes. On Nick at Night they used to do a pop-up video kind of thing that gave extra insight into scenes (If you have seen Seinfeld on DVD it is akin to the notes about nothing).

I think it was the best season because of the Mary/Rhoda/Phyllis story lines.  They had great chemistry.  The characters are more developed and the whole cast is better in season 2.

The extras?  Excuse me for sounding '80s but they are TOTALLY AWESOME!!  The Emmy awards clips are great and the ""Moore On Sunday"" is a real rare gem. Following Mary and the MTM crew as they shot the opening credit scenes is wonderful. I live in Minneapolis and it is great to see the city then and now.

2268490,5,B00096S480,"When TV shows started being released on DVD, there were only a handful of shows I was going to allow myself to buy.  While that number has increased, I've been waited anxiously to get more of this show, one of the originals on the list.  I'm so thankful to finally have a chance to get season two.

With the groundwork laid in the highly successful season one, the cast and crew push on to better themselves with season two.  Several of the supporting characters get better developed here, most noticeably Ted, who gets several episodes that show his big talk is hiding some very low self-esteem.  Bess also gets more episodes this season and some very funny ones at that.  Even Rhoda's mother makes a return visit.  The only character who still seems to suffer is Murray, who only gets one episode devoted to him.  Of course, he doesn't truly come into his own until he has Sue Ann to spar with starting with season 4.

Some of the standout episodes of this season include ""A Girl's Best Mother is Not Her Friend,"" which features the return of Ida Morgenstern.  ""Thoroughly Unmilitant Mary"" finds Mary and Lou the only two members of the newsroom not on strike.  When Mary continues a chain letter, her responses include two men in ""Don't Break the Chain.""  A spineless Mary gets frustrated with a ""Feeb.""  Rhoda and Mary find they are better friends then roommates in ""Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda.""  And Phyllis overreacts to an A for Bess in ""The Care and Feeding of Parents.""

Fans will love this three-disc set.  The episodes have been restored and look great with only the minimal dust in the full frame picture.  The mono sound is great as well.  The extras were originally completed before the set was postponed several years ago and are mostly featured on the back of the third disc.  They included cast and crew commentary on three episodes, clips of the Emmy winners from this season, and an interesting documentary on all eight of the main characters and actors on the show.  There's a twenty-minute look at filming the new footage for the fourth season opening which I found very entertaining.  The parody from ""Mad Magazine"" has some funny bits, but like most stuff from them goes too far and looses it's whit before it's over.  While the ""Newsbeat Segment"" had a few interesting bits in it, most of it wasn't worth watching.

Watching the extras, you get the feeling that everyone loved working on this show.  I think this comes through in the finished product.  While the fashions and sets are dated, the laughter isn't at all.  Here's hoping season three follows soon.",1123632000,11,2592,4.679203539823009

My tapes are definitely showing some wear, and I was about to transfer them all to DVD.  Looks like I can at least hold off on  eps from seasons 1 and 2 now.

I concur with almost all the comments here so far--way to go Fox, it's about time, when will we get the other seasons.  Come on, now, chop chop!",1123632000,7,499,3.8529411764705883
2268492,5,B00096S480,"Finally, after nearly three years of waiting for this set, it's out! I was getting to think that it would never happen. Though the packaging is only slightly different then the first set, it's great to see all these episodes, restored, with pristine sound and color, on DVD. To compare these to the butchered, faded syndication prints which have been running for years, is like night and day.

The second season of the show has never been my favorite, and with the exception of a few episodes (""A Girl's Best Mother is Not Her Friend"", ""Some of My Best Friends are Rhoda"", and ""The Square-Shaped Room""), this is probably the least interesting season to me. I think things really started to pick up in the third year, as the characters became more developed and three-dimensional.

It's upsetting to think, that had Fox stayed on track, that we would probably be seeing the seventh and final season out, by the end of this year, but instead, we are only at season two. Hopefully this one sells, so that the other sets are soon to follow. And Fox, PLEASE get ""Rhoda"" out on DVD, A.S.A.P.!

Nice batch of extras on this set, though I agree in that the ""Newsbeat"" spoof, is a little too odd. My only real gripe with this set, as it is, is that there were two opening themes to the second season, and this set seems to have only one used for all the episodes. In the other version, a clip of Mary laughing from ""Support Your Local Mother"" is used instead of the clip of her and Phyllis. It's a minor thing, but I think that other clip was nicer in the opening.",1123372800,6,1555,4.43006993006993
2268493,4,B00096S480,"In 1985 the nation's professional television critics were polled to determine what where the top TV sitcoms of all time, and the winner ended up being ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (with ""All in the Family"" placing and ""I Love Lucy"" in the show position).  One of the attendant little ironies about this decision is that ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, and that Burns also co-created (with Chris Hayward) the show universally lambasted as the worst sitcom of all time, ""My Mother the Car.""  There is certainly a lesson here to be drawn, but I will leave that for you to do in your copious free time.

I think ""MTM"" developed its A game in its third season and reached full flower in its fourth, which means the show was still in its ascendancy in the twenty-four episodes collected here in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Second Season.""  It was during this season that the writers really started to come up with stories that fleshed out the personalities of the regular characters.  So it is that Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) decides that Mary should be the one to explain to Bess the facts of life in ""The Birds...And...Um...Bees,"" Ted (Ted Knight) tries to impress his visiting brother Hal (Jack Cassidy) in ""Cover Boy,"" Lou (Ed Asner) suspects his son-in-law is cheating on his wife in ""The Six-and-a-Half-Year Itch,"" and Murray (Gavin MacLeod) takes a second job to buy Marie an anniversary gift so she thinks he is having an affair in my favorite second season episode ""The Slaughter Affair.""  If there is one thing I decided during the second season it was that there needed to be more episodes about Murray and less about Ted, but the clueless anchorman has to worry about being replaced when he goes on vacation (""And Now, Sitting in for Ted Baxter""), develops a crush on the daughter of Chuckles the Clown (""Ted Over Heels""), and tries to move into Mary and Rhoda's building (""More Than Neighbors"").

But in the second season the writers are still trying to make Mary's love life, or lack thereof, a main element of the show, and for the most part nobody they bring in is going to be as funny as the characters to be found where Mary works and lives.  So Lou fixes up Mary with one of his friends in ""I Am Curious Cooper,"" then Mary dates her night-school class professor in ""Room 223,"" runs into her old boyfriend at her high school reunion in ""Didn't You Used to Be...Wait...Don't Tell Me!"", dates a politician who is too busy to see her in ""The Five-Minute Dress,"" and finds out the architect she is dating has a son her age in ""You Certainly Are a Big Boy.""  We understand by this point that Mary Richards is not going to get married because that is going to destroy the show.  Besides, the theme song is that she is going to make it after all, not that we actually get to see her reach that point.

The more interesting character in season two ends up being Rhoda (Valerie Harper), who not only has to deal with a return visit from her mother (Nancy Walker) in ""A Girl's Best Mother Is Not Her Friend"" sets up the ""Rhoda"" spin-off that is coming in a few years but loses her job in ""...Is a Friend in Need"" and gets Lou to allow Rhoda to redecorate his house in ""The Square-Shaped Room"" (where I first learned the value a new coat of paint can have to making a room look better).  The friendship between Mary and Rhoda is put to the test when they two live together after Rhoda's apartment is destroyed by a fire (""Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda"") and when Mary forms a friendship with a woman (Mary Frann) who turns out to be prejudice (""Some of My Best Friends Are Rhoda"").

Besides Rhoda the strongest character in the Second Season is Lou Grant, and my second favorite episode is ""Thorough Unmilitant Mary,"" which is where the WJM newsroom goes on strike and Mary and Lou have to produce the entire show by themselves.  Watching Lou Grant on camera delivering the news is one of the season's highlights for me.  In retrospect, it seems clear to me is that the reason Rhoda and Lou are the two strongest supporting characters is because, at this point at least, they are the two regulars who have real relationships with Mary.  You cannot say the same about Mary's relationships with Phyllis and Ted, and although Murray is heading in that direction at this point Bess gets more episodes (e.g., ""Baby Sitcom"" and ""The Care and Feeding of Parents"") than he does.  But that only underscores the fact that the best is yet to come with this classic television situation comedy.  However, since fans are going to want the entire thing on DVD this is hardly going to dissuade any of them from picking up this set simply because it is not as good as what is to come.",1123200000,2,4729,4.517564402810304

If it is the extras that is delaying releases and jacking up the prices, just release the rest of the seasons without them.  The first 2 seasons pretty much covered everything with the extras.

I realized that if I collect enough of these great DVD series releases, I will be able to drop down to basic cable and self program my own TV schedule.

Also, home life and work life begin inter-acting more as Rhoda and Phyllis become more familiar with Mary's boss and co-workers.

The extras are wonderful, although I do think the producers and directors are featured too much. I would rather have had more interviews with the best cast ever than people I didn't know.

2268503,5,B00096S480,"This 3-Disc DVD set of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Second Season"" was released by Fox Home Entertainment on July 26, 2005 -- 1,036 days (nearly three years) after the first-season boxed set came out in late September 2002. But it was worth the wait, in my opinion, because the shows look excellent on these DVDs. The first-season MTM set exhibits nearly-perfect video quality, and this follow-up second-season set looks every bit as good as that first aggregation. Rich in color and detail, the DVD picture quality of these 1971-1972 programs belies their age. The transfer of these film prints to Digital Disc was done just right.

Episode numbers 25 through 48 of The MTM Show are presented in this 24-episode, three-disc collection, which comes housed in three ""Slim"" style plastic cases, placed inside an outer cardboard slipcase box. No booklet is included (except for a multi-page enclosure advertising other Fox TV DVDs).

Episode information is outlined on the back side of each of the three ""ThinPak"" cases, including original CBS-TV air dates and director credits for each episode.

The second season of Mary's series is highlighted by these episodes, which are among my favorites: ""Some Of My Best Friends Are Rhoda"", ""Feeb"", ""The Square-Shaped Room"", ""Thoroughly Unmilitant Mary"", ""The Slaughter Affair"", and ""Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda"".

Two of the three discs in this collection are single-sided platters (with disc art); while Disc #3 is a dual-sided disc (which means no label on that one), with the bonus material being located on Side B of Disc 3.

Here's a detailed look at the Special Features that are contained within this MTM-2 boxed set.............

>> Audio Commentary Tracks on three episodes, one per disc (featuring cast and crew members, including series' co-stars Ed Asner and Gavin MacLeod). The episodes with a Commentary attached are: ""The Birds...And...Um...Bees"", ""The Six-And-A-Half-Year Itch"", and ""The Slaughter Affair"".

>> ""Eight Characters In Search Of A Sitcom"". .... This is a 57-minute retrospective documentary all about the MTM Show (no surprise there, eh?). Plenty of cast and crew interviews were filmed in 2002 for this lengthy documentary program, including chats with the writers, producers, plus actors Ed Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Valerie Harper, Betty White, Cloris Leachman, and Georgia Engel. About the only star missing is, unfortunately, the main star herself, Mary, who doesn't participate in any on-camera interviews here. Ted Knight (""Ted Baxter""), sadly, passed away in August 1986, at age 62.

This is very similar in style to the Season-One DVD documentary. In fact, I'm nearly certain this was filmed at the exact same time as that first-season program. Lots of video clips from the various seasons of the MTM show are sprinkled throughout this feature. Good stuff, although it would have been nice if some behind-the-camera stuff and some outtakes could have been included (but they weren't).

This ""Eight Characters"" bonus is broken into nine chapters, that can each be accessed from a separate Chapter Menu. There's a ""Play All"" option, too, for uninterrupted playing of the whole documentary.

There's a separate ""Chapter"" for each of the ""8 Characters"" who are ""in search of a sitcom"" -- Mary, Lou, Rhoda, Ted, Phyllis, Murray, Georgette, and Sue Ann. The ninth chapter is labelled ""All Together Now"".

>> ""Moore On Sunday"". .... This bonus is extremely fun and interesting. It's from a local Minneapolis TV news broadcast (called ""Moore On Sunday"", which was hosted by Dave Moore of WCCO-TV; no relation at all to Mary Tyler Moore, however). In this 21-minute behind-the-scenes documentary (which originally aired on Minneapolis-St. Paul television in late September of 1973), we follow the MTM film crew as they prepare for and film the new Main Title opening credits for the fourth season of the series in May 1973. (Of course, this really has nothing whatsoever to do with ""Season Two"" specifically -- but, IMO, who cares?! It's still great old, vintage stuff. The narration throughout this nearly half-hour piece is first-rate too; narrated by Dave Moore himself.)

A portion of this featurette had me laughing aloud, when Mr. Moore gets in a really nice ""dig"" (via irony) at the lady who owned the ""119 N. Weatherly"" apartment building that was used in the exterior shots of Mary Richards' TV home. This woman refused to allow the house to be re-filmed for the 4th-Season opening, and decided to hang ""Impeach Nixon"" banners all over the front of her house to dissuade the MTM filming crew. Mr. Moore's following comment is a nifty piece of commentary. I won't give it away here; anyway, I thought it was pretty clever. :)

The ""Moore On Sunday"" piece contains many scenes of Mary Tyler Moore and co-star Valerie Harper going through the paces of filming the show's new opening. Picture quality shows its age here; but this is a really cool hunk of very rarely-seen video; a super-nice inclusion to this boxed set, IMO. Some interesting trivia is revealed in this segment too (I hadn't known it heretofore anyway) -- The man sitting with Mary in the open-air, balcony-style restaurant during the opening credits is Mary's then-husband Grant Tinker.

>> Two 1972 Emmy Awards video clips. .... Ed Asner and Valerie Harper accept their well-deserved Emmy Awards in these video clips from the 1972 Emmy TV broadcast. Valerie actually tied with ""All In The Family's"" Sally Struthers, who we also get to see make her acceptance speech via this footage. The picture quality on these clips isn't too great; but this footage is still wonderful to see, because we get to see these actors step out of character for a moment, circa 1972.

Oddly, this Emmy bonus includes a ""Play All"" option for just this 2-item supplement; but they didn't put a ""Play All"" feature for any of the episodes on these discs. Kind of odd. Total run time for both Emmy clips = approx. 5.5 minutes.

>> ""Newsbeat Segment DM-1509"". .... This is a rather strange little bonus feature. It's an 11-minute comedy spot (or it's intended to be ""comedy"" at any rate); copyright date of 2002. It consists of a ""fake"" newscast of some kind, called ""Newsbeat: In Search Of Mary Richards"", which has a woman acting kind of crazy and off-the-wall as she ""reports"" from various Minneapolis landmarks known to be inhabitated in previous years by ""Mary Richards"" of The MTM Show.

Footnote: There IS one hysterical moment in this thing -- when, in remembrance of ""Chuckles The Clown"" (who, as we all know, was crushed to death by a rogue elephant during the 6th season of the MTM series), the ""reporter"" asks a man on the street ""What were you doing October 25, 1975?"" (the night of the ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"" classic TV broadcast). The man paused for a moment, and then responded: ""In the penitentiary"". THAT had me LOL for a minute indeed. :-)

This  ""Newsbeat"" bonus is partially redeemed by what is, IMO, a very clever ending sequence, which features ""Newsbeat Reporter Nancy Sykes"" (played, btw, by Kate Asner, daughter of Ed Asner) placing herself in Mary Richards' shoes during an excellent ""re-creation"" of the MTM opening credits (while ""Fonda's"" jazzed-up, and quite good, version of ""Love Is All Around"" plays beneath the video). A very cute ending to an otherwise really odd and unfunny supplement.

>> ""Mad Magazine"" Parody: ""The Mary Tailor-Made Show"". .... This is a really funny text-only bonus feature that displays pages of an MTM Show parody from issue No. 155 of ""Mad Magazine"" (circa December 1972). Those ""Mad"" guys really let Mary have it too, in this scathing laugh-filled spoof that pokes fun at everything from Mary's clothes, to Lou's grumpiness, to Ted's ignorance, to Rhoda's Jewishness, to the lousy news-reporting performed at TV station WJM. The names of the characters were changed (""to protect the innocent"", perhaps?; hehe) -- with Lou Grant becoming ""Mr. Grunt"" for the purposes of this ""Mad"" piece. While Ted is re-named ""Klod"", Phyllis is ""Chillus"", Murray is known here as ""Blurry"", and Rhoda's name is mangled into ""Rodent Droopstern"" (LOL!).

My favorite line from this comic-book-like parody is when Mary proclaims: ""Let me change into another Christian Dior original! I want to be among the world's ten best-dressed $92-a-week office flunkies!"" (ROFL!)

These ""Mad"" text screens must be advanced by the user via the remote control. Thankfully, it's an at-your-own-pace type of text-based DVD feature, without an automatic ""timed"" track. God help those people trying to read these text pages on a small TV screen, though. That might be kinda tough on the ol' eyeballs. :-)

>> Photo Gallery. .... Like the Season-One MTM ""Gallery"", this second-season batch of photos is a bit of a disappointment to this writer. There are no pictures at all from the actual Season-Two MTM set or of the cast or crew from the year this season was made. Instead, we get several ""Script Pages"" from Ed Asner's private collection (the covers for the scripts even show the word ""Ed"" in the corner); plus a few random shots of the cast and crew members preparing to do their Audio Commentary Tracks for this DVD collection. Like the ""Mad Magazine"" bonus, this Gallery is not on a ""timed"" screen-advancing track either; DVD remote keystrokes control the advancement of the Photo pages.

>> ""Love Is All Around"" Theme Song Karaoke. .... This consists of two different versions of the MTM Show Opening Titles, with captions on screen.

>> All-Star Trivia Challenge. .... Cloris Leachman (""Phyllis"") introduces this ""trivia"" bonus; and then members of the cast and crew ask some MTM trivia questions. Then you've got to pick the correct answer among four choices on screen. After selecting an answer, a video clip from the show will provide the correct response to that question. Your ""final score"" is announced at the end of the quiz.

-----------------------

Additional DVD Info ................

>> VIDEO -- Full Frame 1.33:1 Aspect Ratio (the original TV ratio).

>> AUDIO -- Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks are included in English and Spanish.

>> SUBTITLES -- English and Spanish.

>> ""PLAY ALL EPISODES"" OPTION INCLUDED? -- No.

>> MENUS -- Non-animated; Silent (no music); Separate Episode Sub-Menus for each program. ... The Menus and Language Set-Up are exactly like the Season-One MTM set, including the slightly-annoying (but not overly so) mini ""delay"" after choosing anything from any of the Menu screens. There's that built-in ""pause"" that takes just an extra 'beat' to get to the next Menu choice. But the Menu design is very classy, IMO, with everything laid out in the unique ""MTM-type Font/Lettering"". Nice touch, to keep it all in the ""MTM Spirit"".

>> CHAPTER BREAKS? -- Yes. 10 Chapter Stops per show.

Season Two is another great year of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". And getting to finally see these 24 episodes via these well-polished DVDs makes Mary's sophomore campaign look even better than when the shows first aired on network television in 1971 and 1972. And with all of the Season-Two episodes combined with plentiful and really fun-to-watch bonus supplements, this 3-Disc DVD set from Fox Home Entertainment is a special treat for any fan of ""Miss Richards"" (aka: Mary Tyler Moore).",1122508800,15,11305,5.040192926045016
2268504,5,B00096S480,"At first we were told that the second season of ""Mary"" was delayed by FOX due to poor sales of the slightly over-priced season 1--- but they know 35 year-old shows rarely fly-off the shelves like crazy.

Then the more-credible story ciruclated that FOX had internal political bickering over the costs of the extras for season 2 (including documentaries shot for each year, produced by Ed Asner and his son).

Now, season 2 is out, in all its glory, chock-full of extras... yet Miss Moore is mysteriously missing from the interview footage they shot in 2002--- even though she WAS interviewed (as is evidenced by the documentary for season 1) and everyone else in the cast appears, except for the late Ted Knight!

Makes one go, ""hmmmmmmmmmm...""

Anyway, a good Season 2 collection (and cheaper, this time!), although it includes a 1973 local Minneapolis documentary on the shooting of the new title-sequence which would have been more appropriate for the season 4 DVD release--- but, hey!, I'm not complaining.

And, yes, the moody-perspective shot of Mary walking down the street and looking up to her right (from the original theme design) that FOX has on their 'Mary' site would have been far better a box-cover for season 1 & 2 than what they used, but, what the heck... at least we've got finally 'em...",1122422400,3,1308,4.821428571428571
2268505,5,B00096S480,"It was well worth the wait!  Fox has done a great job with packaging and pricing Season 2.  Hopefully the rest of the series is forthcoming.

2268506,5,B00096S480,"Given the three year timeframe between this set and the first one, there was much concern whether Fox would even release a season two DVD. The studio caught alot of heat from consumers over the high price tag of the season one set. However, Fox has apparently LISTENED to buyers, by not only releasing The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete Second Season with the same splendid level of picture quality and quantity of extras as the first set, but this time at a reasonably affordable price at the time of its release!

With a slightly smaller box size than the first MTM set, each of the three discs of this set comes in its own slim case - Disc One contains: Episodes 1-8; Disc Two: Episodes 9-16; Disc Three: Episodes 17-24. Special features include audio commentary on selected episodes, all-new documentary: ""8 Characters in Search of a Sitcom"", Original 1973 documentary: ""Moore on Sunday"", Emmy Award show clips, all-star trivia challenge, Mad Magazine parody, theme song karaoke track, photo gallery & more!

If sales are good for this season two set, then Fox should release subsequent seasons (with the same quality packaging as the first two sets) with a better release timeframe between sets. Until then, enjoy yet another quality MTM Show season set filled with brilliant episodes and great extras!",1122336000,3,1313,4.883408071748879
2268507,5,B00096S480,"The MTM show contains the episode ranked #1 in the all-time list of great TV comedy shows (""Chuckles Bites the Dust"")  The show one multiple Emmy awards and is considered one of the best of all time.  Why did Fox wait years between seasons one and two?  The first season didn't sell all that well.  Small wonder with the sloppy artwork and promotion they gave the first set.  I think a lot of people were turned off by the plain white background with a retro-looking photo of MTM herself.

But.. the remastering on the first season was quite good, a notch above the awful dubs that have been circulating in syndication since the show went off the air.  And the comedy is character-based and timeless.  The show really comes into its own in seasons three and four.  But season two is a big improvement over the first season when the show sometimes seemed to falter a bit in defining the characters.

The quality and price of the discs is now in everyone's range - $20 if you buy this during the initial release.  The first season also seems to be coming back at a reduced rate.",1122249600,3,1076,4.438775510204081
2268508,5,B00096S480,"i don't understand fox at all. while i'm glad that the best sitcom to ever grace the small screen, has finally got 2 seasons out on dvd, it's a shame it's taken forever. fox has done the same thing with nypd blue too. i agree all of these sets were overpriced to begin with. but i'm also of the opinion, that there are enough hardcore fans who will buy these sets. now, lets get season 3 through 7 released. and while you're at it fox, there are a ton more seasons of blue to release as well!!",1121990400,2,493,4.092783505154639
2268509,5,B00096S480,"She had spunk. As Lou Grant (Ed Asner) noted in the first episode, he hated that. Luckily, the rest of the nation loved it. Mary Tyler Moore lit up ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" during its run and after a string of movie disasters returned to the small screen with ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" a series that was pitch perfect for her small screen persona. I always think of Mary Tyler Moore as a single, hipper Samantha Stevens without the magic. She had her comic foils but she didn't have to go home with them and deal with their ranting and ravings about all the mistakes she had made during the episode. Moore's show created by writer/director/producer James L. Brooks (""Broadcast News"") and Allan Burns poked fun at everything from the nosy next door neighbor (Phyllis expertly played by Cloris Leachman soon to get her own show) to the goofy, uncertain best friend ( Rhoda played by Valerie Harper and soon to get her own show as well). She had the clueless but big hearted boss (Ed Asner as Lou Grant soon to get his own show- I see a trend here...) and the stuffy news anchor (expertly played by the funny, diverse Ted Knight so well that for many years nobody could see him as anything but the stuffy ""you fill in the blanks"" character on a number of shows).

After a two year wait the second season FINALLY comes to DVD. It seems that Fox was disappointed by the sales of the first season which came with many of the same bells and whistles as this one does. What Fox failed to factor they had priced the first season way too high. So the lesson learned here is that when you price any series or movie too high smart buyers are going to rent it or, better yet, wait until you finally drop the price to purchase it. So it really wasn't due to any fault in the quality of the boxed set but the idiocy and greed of the marketing department. This ain't ""The X-Files"" folks (and that series would have sold much, much better if it had also been priced more affordably like Fox has been doing lately with retailers). So this set has been languishing (along with extras) in DVD purgatory until this year two and a half years after the initial release of this series.

The second season of ""MTMS"" looks as sharp and colorful as the first. While some of the episodes are a bit dark, the colors are much richer and more vibrant than any syndicated version of the series I've ever seen. It's hard to compare to the original broadcast episodes because it's been so long and the quality of color TVs just can't compare (and neither can memory) to that of the current crop of HDTV ready TVs. The images are clean of analog artifacts for the most part and look crisper than Mary's 70's era disco inspired outfits. There's only so much that you can do to improve mono sound. ""MTMS"" sounds really good with clear dialog and music cues.

I was afraid with the lower price for this set that Fox might skimp on the extras but seeing as how they already had them lined up, they've kept them in tact for this release. Future releases, on the other hand, may not have much of anything.  Fox has included the Mad magazine parody ""The Mary Tailor-Made Show"" with each panel presented in a large enough format to read. We get the first season and season two through seven openings with their dizzy pop zoom shots in karaoke format. The re-recorded theme with different opening lyrics and a more easy listening arrangement misses the energy of the later season opening theme. It sounds as if the opening was re-recorded and then edited together with the earlier theme song. We get clips from the Emmy Awards for Ed Asner and Valerie Harper for the second season  of the series. Asner's acceptance speech is a crack up. Harper tied with Sally Struthers (""All in the Family"") in a unique situation that hasn't occurred since. We get Struthers and Harper both giving their acceptance speeches. Struthers is a crack up.

We also get a ""News Beat"" segment from the comedy show. How is that tied into "" The Mary Tyler Moore Show""? They go in search of Mary Richards and everywhere she went. ""Moore on Sunday"" is from a local TV program with behind-the-scenes footage of the shooting of the second season opening title. The color on this extra is quite faded and the picture quality so-so but, hey, it's a piece of history. ""8 characters in Search of a Sitcom"" features writers-producers-creators Jim Brooks, Alan Burns, director Jay Sandrich Joan Darling actor/teacher/director of the episode ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" provides some great comments about the various characters in the series. Members of the cast such as Ed Asner, Betty White, Valerie Harper and others appear discussing their characters and the relationships on the show. We also get a photo gallery that includes pictures of scripts from the series all provided by Ed Asner. There are also photos of Gavin MacLeod and director Peter Baldwin at the DVD commentary session, Asner preparing to shoot the Trivia Game for the DVD, Paul Sand and producer David Davis again shot while they were prepping for their commentary tracks. We even get good old Cleveland Armory the TV critic for TV Guide during the 70's with his recap of the Emmy Awards and who won. There's also the ""All-Star Trivia Challenge"" hosted by Asner. Sadly, the only person missing from all this is Mary Tyler Moore herself.

 A classic, classy package from Fox, I'm happy that ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete 2nd Season"" has finally been released from DVD purgatory by Fox. It was worth it guys. With the second season more reasonably priced than the first, I'm hoping this second season will sell better than the first and prompt Fox to release the remaining seasons on DVD. Fox has done a marvelous job of transferring this classic series and providing great extras as well.",1120953600,30,5790,4.598257502420135
2268510,5,B00096S480,"The MTM Show was one of the very best ever made. I cannot stand to see the stuff they call sitcom today; nothing but biting sarcasm, snotty kids, really obvious double entendre, with laugh tracks added by lobotomy patients. I am puzzeled by the release on DVD of these pathetic shows while MTM remained in lock up. Thank you, thank you THANK YOU! Now get the rest of the seasons out.",1120521600,9,383,4.408450704225352
2268511,5,B00096S480,"After purchasing season 1, i was hoping season 2 would be under way. After a few years i almost gave up hope. Now, in July, season 2 will be available, and thank goodness! As Saturday night tv in the early to mid seventies included 'All In The Family' 'Bob Newhart' and 'The Carol Burnette Show"", Mary Tyler Moore became a fixture, and an icon.

Despite releasing many tv shows that were luke-warm-received during it's first run, I am suprised that it took this long to release Mary's show (and only up to season 2) at that!

No other tv show at that time (1970's) had so many lovable, but different characters on one show, that at least one of us could identify with, and to be spun off numerously with good shows ""Phyllis"", ""Rhoda"" and ""Lou Grant"".

I know i'll have to wait for the episodes with Betty White, where her interplay with Lou Grant is priceless, but am happy that season 2, hopefully with the same high quality transfer that season 1 will be.

Thanks to Fox, I will again laugh at, and with, some of my 'friends', who when i was in my early teens gave me laughter at a time when it as cool to stay home and just 'chill' with the family.",1119830400,9,1151,4.314814814814815
2268512,5,B00096S480,"Dear God, first of all- THANK YOU!! for finally allowing the nice people at Fox DVD to release Mary Tyler Moore Season Two. When the first set was released I thought all my dreams were finally going to come true. Sadly, I found that fate had played a cruel joke on me and left me with a very sad dvd box set, that set was wonderful indeed, but it depressed me just to look at it thinking it would never know the joy of sitting next to it's six siblings that were even better, truth be told. Now after many hours of prayer- season two will be coming home on July 26th. I am filled with joy at having this incredible season, but also filled with dread at the possibility of never knowing the joy of seasons 3-7 on DVD. I long ago stopped questioning the logic of DVD companies that produce other titles like ""The Tick"", ""The Jeff Foxworthy Show"" season 1, and ""Father of the Pride"" entire series. I'm sure these are wonderful, but are they as worthy as Mary? Ours is not to question why, just go to the store and BUY BUY BUY. Dear Lord, thank you from the bottom of my heart for season two of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. And Jesus, please let seasons 3-7 see the light of day. Amen.",1119657600,4,1179,4.175438596491228
2268513,5,B00096S480,"I was so excited when they released the first MTM DVD and when they said that season two would follow the next spring, I was waiting with baited breath....and then nothing.  Well there is finally a definite realse date.

This season was when the show started to become the best series of the 70's.  The classic episodes include:

DISC ONE

Room 223 - Murry leaves early one day and Mary covers for him.  When a giant news story comes over the teletype, Mary cannot write the copy in time.  She decides to take a night course in news writing.  Rhoda joins her to meet guys.  Of course, the instructor falls for Mary.

A Girl's Best Mother is Not Her Friend - Nancy Walker returns as Ida.  When she and Rhoda show up in Mother Daughter dresses, you just lose it... and you could see that a Rhoda series was not far behind.

Thoroughy Unmilitant Mary - The news writers go on strike and the talent follows.  This leaves Mary and Lou to do everything, including Lou on air.  This is Lou's best episode.  The first night Lou goes on air and freezes.  The next night he gets totally drunk and ....

DISC TWO

...Is a Friend In Need - Rhoda looses her job and Mary tries to help out.  But when a ""perfect"" job arises at WJM, Mary does not want Rhoda to apply for it.

The Square Shaped Room - Lou wants to surprise his wife with having the living room redecorated while she is away.  He hires Rhoda and she converts it from 60's suburbs to 70's cosmopolitan.

DISC THREE

Baby SitCom - Mary is suppose to babysit Bess but an old friend comes to town and asks her out.  When she cannot find a suitable replacement, Lou volunteers (his TV is broken and there is a big fight on).  This turns the show into Baby and the Beast.

Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda - The funniest episode of the year (on any show.) When Rhoda has a fire in her apartment Mary has her stay with her.  And like fish, things begin to...

Some of My Best Friends are Rhoda - This is a show with a social purpose.  Mary's new friend always has a reason for not including Rhoda (except the real one - she is antisemetic.)  This episode handles the issue with depth and perceptiveness without ever getting preachy.

THE EXTRAS - Side B of Disc 3

8 Characters in Search of a Sitcom -  This is a behind the scenes documentary with interviews with the surviving memebers of the cast (except Mary) and the principal writers and directors)

Moore on Sunday - a documentary on the making of the revamped opening.

Emmy Award acceptance speechs by Ed and Valerie.

Newsbeat Segment - a mocumentary on the importance of the show with a ""newswoman"" who believes Mary Richards existed.

This show is like I Love Lucy, it only gets better with time.  That is why it is one of Nickelodeon/TV Land's classic shows.  Lets hope they don't wait another three years for season 3!!!",1119312000,2,2828,4.375722543352601
2268514,5,B00096S480,"I totally agree with reviewer ""Vinny"".  With all the other crappy DVD releases of one-hit wonders, Mary and the WJM gang deserve better.  Won't be totally satisfied until I have the entire series in my hands.  C'mon Fox!  Get to work!!!!",1119139200,3,237,4.7073170731707314

2268516,5,B00096S480,"The reason Season 1 did so lousy sales-wise is that the MSRP was $50! Who wants to buy a 35 year old tv series (as great as it was) for so much money?

So, the brain surgeons at Fox held out on releasing Season 2 until they had this great idea of lowering its MSRP to $30.00.

Its a great series. Hopefully, we'll get all 7 Seasons.",1118361600,8,332,3.9402985074626864
2268517,5,B00096S480,"I share mostpeople's opinions here. Slow sales stalled the release of this second season but what I can't figure out it why people didn't buy the first season in the first place? Did people not know about it? Do young people not know about this classic show? One can only hope that sales are good for this season and it will renew interest in the first season. I can't imagine not getting Seasons 3-7 but you never know.

I grew up watching The Mary Tyler Moore show  on Saturday nights and even then I thought it was funny. Not all shows hold up years later but this certainly does. The cast is great, the writing top notch and even the theme song is hum worthy.",1118102400,4,663,4.296
2268518,5,B00096S480,"Season 2 is finally being released. People at Fox have come to their senses.  It's been almost three years since Season 1 was released.  What the hell took so long? This was the best comedy series ever produced. No other TV series before it or since has come close to ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""  Winner of 29 Emmy Awards in it's seven year run says it all. Sure, the show is a little dated by todays standards, but so what. Who could not love those characters?  My favourites are bumbling Ted Baxter, sweet Georgette and acid-tongued Sue Ann.

With so much garbage out on DVD now, and dumb stupid Reality shows on television, they're not much to watch.

Please release the remaining seasons quickly (maybe every 3 months or so.)  That would be great.  Thanks Fox for getting your act together.",1117756800,5,794,4.542253521126761
2268519,5,B00096S480,"How is it that this was a top rated show for seven years in the seventies, and be so forgotten now? This is classic television. If sales were so poor for the first season, I think we all need to rush out and buy this second season, or else we won't get season three for another 4 years! There wasn't a better show on TV then, and when I look at all this ""reality"" stuff flooding our channels...I'd rather watch wit and wisdom from Mary, Rhoda, Murray, Mr. Grant, Phillis, and yes...even Sue Ann.",1117584000,5,495,4.276595744680851
2268520,5,B00096S480,"Rather than express gratitude to Fox for finally releasing MTM's 2nd season on DVD, why after all this time don't they have a rapid-fire release schedule for the full run, as was done for the Van Dyke Show, for instance. Even better, they should have had the full series available in one big box set. It's disgraceful that the funniest sitcom ever is being released in a piecemeal fashion, while trashy, unfunny series get preferential treatment.",1116892800,7,446,4.881578947368421
2268521,5,B00096S480,"Thank God that Fox has gifted the world with another full season of one of the greatest television sitcoms ever created!  It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that season after season of trash like ""Full House"" gets released but MTM collects dusts in vaults.  Would also love to see ""Rhoda"" and ""Phyllis"" released, but know this is probably a long shot.",1116547200,9,356,4.819672131147541
2268522,5,B00096S480,"I'm so excited that the FEEBS at Fox finally wised up and decided to continue their MTM season releases.  Sitcoms from the 70s, like MTM, Bob Newhart, Maude & Barney Miller struck a chord in me that others that have aired since have not.  So this DVD release will truly be one of the highlights of my summer.

As for the previous message poster's comment about getting his Veal Prince Orloff... do you know what happens to us fans if you leave seasons 3 thru 7 off the sales floor too long?

WE DIE!!!

...Okay, that's an exaggeration.  But I couldn't help myself!

Other great MTM shows => Lou Grant, Hill Street Blues, Phyllis, Tony Randall Show, Rhoda, Newhart, WKRP...

Fox, if you're smart you'll get all these buried treasures out for us eager consumers to... well... CONSUME!",1116115200,16,782,4.615942028985507

I must say that I enjoyed the first season on DVD a lot and I couldn't wait until the second season -and all the rest- would be released! I would definetely buy it as soon as it is released, as I think that it's both funny and it represents its social environment, that is the 70's environment...

Plus the picture quality of the first season was superb and I expect the same for the second season too!",1115510400,10,562,4.203703703703703
2268524,5,B00096S480,"Finally!  While so much crap is coming out on DVD the best show of all time is finally getting it's due.  Thank you Fox for having the good sense to release a TV classic.  It was during this time [1970's] that sitcoms made the change to reflect what was going on in America.  Always funny and sometimes controversial, Mr. Grant got divorced, Mary was a liberated women etc.  The cast was perfect for their roles.  This show is very tame by todays standards, but still original and hillarious.  No need to go into details of the show because we all know about the show.  I watched this show when I was a kid in the 70's and liked it then.  Fans please buy this DVD so Fox will release the rest of the seasons, before they use up their supply of DVDs for more releases of American Idol or some other crap show.",1115164800,111,808,4.228758169934641

Thanks to FOX for finally releasing it!!

Season 2 is a great season. Especially the one called-""He's no Heavy He's My Brother"", where Rhoda and Mary plan a trip to Mexico and end up delivering what they think is illegal goods.

Bravo to one of the best shows ever written for television. With a record 29 Emmy wins, this show deserves more respect then it's been given in the release of its DVDs.",1114560000,6,523,4.484210526315789
2268527,5,B00096S480,"This is one DVD set I've been waiting for for too long.

I was one of the people who paid full price for MTM Season One and have still been enjoying it. Enclosed in that boxed set was a flyer stating that Season Two would be released March 2003, which we all know never materialized.

Yes, I'm one of those who signed online petitions for Fox to please release the second season. Thank you Fox for listening to us.

The Mary Tyler Show from 1970-1977 was one of the best series ever produced for television. The characters are believable and flawlessly performed by talented actors. The chemistry between the cast members made this a classic. Although I hate to mention this, but there have been many other television series that are available on DVD that do not equal the original MTM, so it puzzles me why MTM series was placed on the back burner.

You can bet I will purchase this one the day it is released, and hope we don't have to wait this long for the other seasons. I will buy them all.

Thanks again Fox!",1114300800,7,1015,4.377659574468085
2268528,5,B00096S480,"Finally Fox is releasing season two of the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show.""  Since it's getting harder and harder to find on regular TV, fans should try and purchase it the day it comes out, so that future seasons will be released.  Each season built upon the prior ones so there's so much more fun to come in seasons 3-7.  Save a few bucks a week starting now and support the release in July.",1114300800,6,385,4.2465753424657535
2268529,5,B00096S480,"After two years of consumer petitioning and campaigning, Twentieth Century-Fox has finally reconsidered its stance on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", and is releasing Season Two.  The Season One release seems to have generated disappointing sales, at least in the beginning, so the Season Two release was ""iffy"" for a long time, with one Fox exec saying that it was unlikely to happen at all.

Fortunately, Fox has listened to the entreaties of fans, so we're getting Season Two, with what appears to be the same impeccable standard of presentation that made Season One one of the highest-quality classic television releases on DVD.  Best of all, Fox has corrected the problem that many people felt was a ""killer"" for the Season One release- a very high list price.  The Season Two release is popularly priced at a list of less than $30, and is already being discounted, so pricing should not be an issue this time.

Fans of the show are getting a very rare extra on the Season Two release; it's called ""Newsbeat Segment DM-1509"".  When the MTM Enterprises crew visited the Twin Cities in early 1970 to shoot the famous opening credits, a real Minneapolis TV station did a news feature on the filming. That film, forgotten for over three decades, has been unearthed, and should give fans a ""first day"" look at the creation of the show.

Thanks to Fox for listening to fans, and here's hoping that the new release will lead to availability of more ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" seasons.  It should: this is one series that just got better as it went along.",1114300800,12,1546,4.721189591078067

Thanks to all of you guys and girls out there for supporting this release since 1992.

After all, these actors aren't going to live forever and wouldn't it have been a shame if Ed Asner (Lou) and Gavin MacLeod (Murray) never got to record the audio commentary tracks.

I cannot wait until the other seasons get released too!  ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"" (season 6) was byfar the best out of all the 168 episodes!!",1113868800,10,472,4.453488372093023
2268532,5,B00096S480,"After a very long and uncomfortable wait-and-see period where every other TV show was being guaranteed multiple DVD releases, the Mary Tyler Moore show is back on DVD. 48 episodes in the 1971-1972 season give aficionados of quality classic television something of their own to smile about.

There are less DVD discs included this set than the previous MTM season release, but if it is needed to keep the price down and increase audience purchasing level, so be it. Personally, I would rather have a whole season DVD with extras dispersed throughout the package than pay lots more money for a package with an extras DVD or a really low price for a really limited selection of episodes with not much of anything.

Beginning with this season's opener, a new version of ""Love is all around"" is used for the show. These new song lyrics are now assuring us that Mary will indeed make it on her own. Mary is a confident independent woman who can and does survive whatever is in her work and personal lives.

Notable episodes from this season include ""A girl's mother is not her best friend"" because Rhoda's mother Ida Morgenstern (Nancy Walker). Seeing how her daughter's friends get along with their own mothers has encouraged Ida to try some bonding with Rhoda. It does not work as well as she had planned.

""And now, sitting in for Ted Baxter"" has the WJM-TV staff ponder their next move after a fill in replacement for anchor Ted Baxter is actually more popular than the person who was being replaced. Ted isn't a bad person, but he just comes across on camera as being full of himself.

Rhoda begins wearing her soon-to-be-trademark headscarf in ""The square-shaped room"". Lou clashes with Rhoda after recognizing her own designing tastes are thoroughly modern. He had hired her to redecorate his family's living room while wife Edie was out.

Mary gets a personal dose of politics in ""The five-minute dress"" because she tries to date a Governor's aide. Unfortunately like their boss, governor's aides also have busy schedules. This public-sector reality hinders their relationship because a super-busy work literally prevents him from keeping a date.

Mary takes another dip into the world of politics with ""His two right arms"". After getting him to agree going on 'Face the People' Mary discovers that City Council member Pete Peterson (Bill Daily) is completely incompetent. She must then work in tandem with his aides in order for Peterson to have a fighting chance on that TV show.

I really like the strong buddy system which Mary, Rhoda, and Phyllis have this season. Although this series is officially called the `Mary Tyler Moore Show', having a member of the trio looking 'outcast' and reduced to a prop would not be appropriate. Each member of this clique shines in their own right.

Hopefully the prolonged (and truly unnecessary) delay of this season's DVD release will remind people that letting the studios know you want a DVD out is important business. Don't underestimate the potential clout of public opinion; we can make the studios produce the shows we want out on DVD.",1113091200,30,3086,4.862857142857143
