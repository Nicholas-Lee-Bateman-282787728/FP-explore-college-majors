8716894,5,B00XWI1M0E,A little different than the other 6 Bengtzon episodes with longer episodes and more psychological! Recommended for lovers of European dramas.,1494374400,,141,5.761904761904762
8716895,5,B00XWI1M0E,Great series,1485475200,,12,5.5
8716896,4,B00XWI1M0E,"I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE ALTHOUGH THE CHARACTER BECAME TOO HEAVY HANDED AS TIME WENT ON.  THE IDEA IS GREAT AND THE ACTING IS SUPERIOR, BUT IT ALSO GOES A LONG WAY IN DEPICTING THE OBJECTIONABLE THINGS ONE HEARS ABOUT THE HEARTLESSNESS OF THE MEDIA.  Sometimes one is on Annikia side but then she does something like interview the husband of a murdered woman with a special carelessness of the bereaving man and daughter, one would hope she wouldn't stoop so low. It is clear the deadline is more important tun her children and husband who she usurped in a not-too-pleasant way.  Nonetheless, I still liked the character and the actor was particularly good and I could see a future for her.  Her follow-on was a younger, more sophisticated woman who had no great character traits for playing this role other than that of a egotistical, narcissistic bitch.",1447027200,,853,4.743243243243243
8716897,2,B00XWI1M0E,"These two Annika Bengtzon movies aren't nearly the quality of the later ones. The acting, writing and direction just don't have the professionalism of the more recent releases which are very good. And the lead actress has a habitual facial movement that is very distracting. Can't believe her manager hasn't told her.

8716898,4,B00XWI1M0E,"Amazon incorrectly labels these two films as episodes 7 and 8 of a television series.  In fact they are feature films which appeared several years before the television series was made.  The actress playing Bengtzon is superior to that of the TV version (as are the full casts in general), her character is substantially more complex and interesting, and both films are better made and more engaging.",1445299200,9,400,4.955223880597015
8716899,5,B00XWI1M0E,"Great product, accurate & clear product description, fast & excellent service & communication",1441411200,,93,6.230769230769231
8716900,5,B00XWI1M0E,"England, Sweden, Italy & other foreign countries really know how to produce excellent mystery/crime stories.  Loved the Annika Bengtzon Crime Reporter episodes.",1441065600,3,160,6.2727272727272725
8716901,3,B00XWI1M0E,not as good as the first six episodes,1440979200,,37,3.75
8716902,4,B00XWI1M0E,"Thel only thing I disliked about this part of the series is it appears that the character of Bengtzon was played by a different
actress than the one in the first part of the series.",1439337600,7,181,4.2
