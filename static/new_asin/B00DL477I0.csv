5825208,5,B00DL477I0,"Anyone who has sexual, intimacy or porn addiction problems should watch this film. It will help you to heal! Even if you have none of these issues, bring your lover to this film. I guarantee you, if you're even a somewhat sensitive person, you will make passionate love to each other after watching Don Jon! It's that good!

If you're a psychotherapist or if you lead a support group for intimacy or sex addiction problems, I highly recommend watching this film! It will benefit both you and your clients!

While this film is geared to heterosexuals it will benefit anyone regardless of your sexual preference!

If you have never experienced true emotional intimacy with another human being, or a truly loving sexual relationship, Don Jon will give you some idea what true emotional intimacy or a loving, sexual relationship is all about!

This movies is so profound - and it's ramifications are so deep - I'm starting to get emotional myself as I write this review!",1381017600,,966,4.801204819277109
5825209,4,B00DL477I0,"""WATCH OUT! Here comes a new horror facing your multiplexes. A film so frightening and offensive that it will hurt the eyes and ears of Americans because it deals with sex and pornography. Well, while an exaggeration, it was satirically said to show that Don Jon, despite its controversial subject matter, did not get the stigma it received as much as Showgirls and Shame, which are notably rated NC-17 for this kind of thing.

While slightly censored from its Sundance debut as Don Jon's Addiction, this R-rated version is notably effective, funny, surprising, and not ham-fisted too much in its craziness that it deserves some special commendation as a debut feature film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the cantankerous New Jersey iron-pumping jerk who goes out find his way to fulfill his sexually deviant life only to come across a ""10"" when he meets Scarlet Johansson's character, Barbara (a weird name for a young woman). His life goes even more imbalanced when his addiction gets the best of him by affecting his relationship, his weekly Catholic prayers, and his education. The film works on so many levels, surprisingly, to show him as an individual who thinks he has it all but does not and start to slow down the machismo when he meets Julianne Moore's character, Esther, at a community college.

While the adverts come across as laugh-out-loud and titillating, the film is a little more darker and twisted in tone yet more human and dramatic toward the end and that, in a way, saves the film quite a bit. Added to that, the energy that is given with the rapid editing, brisk pace (only 90 minutes long), frank material (even without sight of genitalia, gross images of Internet smut are pretty obvious), pumping epilogue, and situational sense of humour are what make Don Jon less of a traditional Don Juan but more of a cautionary tale about sexuality in your 20s for our time. The humour is pretty lively too with a well-crafted, publicised scene involving Jon singing to Marky Mark's Good Vibrations. Tony Danza as his boisterous and stereotypical gruff father is perfect as Jon's father to where he can be a great character study in this review too but with space permitting sometime soon.

For a film that deals with sex, it is not corny and not as overtly chauvinistic as some may expect like in That's My Boy, Freddy Got Fingered, Scary Movie, or most pornography but responsibly done with a sense of humour and vibrancy Shame lacked (but that was more of a serious dramatic contemplation of addiction). If daring, give this one a try especially if you are in your 20s. You won't be disappointed!""",1380672000,2,2613,4.815144766146993
5825210,5,B00DL477I0,"If you believe the porn industry has no relevance in the modern world, you're sadly mistaken.  Like it or loathe it, porn is big business, earning somewhere in the ballpark of $10-15 billion per year.  Much like Hollywood, the adult film industry has stars of its own, a few of which have managed to become household names, most notably of which include Linda Lovelace, Jenna Jameson, and Ron Jeremy.  It should come as no surprise that pornography has been around since man began using the printing press, and speaking of men, they are by far and away (statistically) the greatest abusers of the material.  As it pertains to relationships, and depending who you ask, porn will either ruin a relationship or stimulate a relationship.  All of this and more, including the impact porn has on the male species and how it comes into play during relationships happens to be the basis for the new comedy, Don Jon.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his feature length directorial debut, also writing and starring in the comedy, Don Jon.  Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, but his friends call him ""The Don"" because of his outstanding success with the ladies.  Jon enjoys several aspects of life, including his place, ride, boys, church - and porn.  In fact, his biggest addiction is online porn.  One night at the club, Jon meets a beautiful girl, Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), but this girl isn't like the rest of girls he meets.  He actually has to work to get her into bed, but that's perfectly fine with him.  He's so attracted to this girl that he's willing to do the things she wants him to do to in order to make her happy - including going back to school.  To complicate matters, Barbara walks in on him watching porn, and adamantly demands that he promise to stop.  He agrees, but is unable to control his urge, even watching it while he's in school - where he also befriends an emotional woman, Esther (Julianne Moore).  Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, Rob Brown, and Jeremy Luke also star in supporting roles.

Before this review goes any further, it should be noted that if you're even a little bit squeamish or easily embarrassed by heavy doses of pornography or sex, this film isn't for you and you should feel free to move on right now.  There are very few scenes over the course of his film that doesn't include sex, porn, and a discussion about those two particular topics.  At the same time, films that usually incorporate a great deal of sexuality normally wouldn't mesh well with religion.  Still, this film manages to heavily combine sex and the church, as this lead character obviously cares about his religion, and his porn.  Often humorously, Jon makes weekly confessions about his indiscretions, despite his willingness to repeatedly sin - and without fail, is absolved of his sins and told to do several Hail Marys.

This film's concept might seem like a questionable means of entertainment, but Don Jon raises a great deal of questions and observations about society.  Not only does the film make a decent point about society's interaction with porn, but it also delves into the relationship aspect and consequence.  Society has clearly gotten to a point where porn isn't as much of a concern as it used to be, other than to certain individuals who are controlling or self-conscious - at least that's a point this film tries to make.  Naturally, it uses a great deal of comedy to get its point across, but not really laugh-out-loud comedy.  Don Jon's comedy is a bit more ironic that blatantly funny, especially since the majority of the humor comes from the male characters ogling at pretty girls in tight dresses.

Don Jon might be the name of this film, but it could just as easily be called the Joseph Gordon-Levitt Show.  He writes, directs, and stars in this film - and thrives in each and every position.  For anyone that's skeptical that Gordon-Levitt chewed off more than he could handle, they couldn't be more wrong.  In fact, he is so superb in every aspect of this film that it's hard to determine which role he thrives in more than the other.  He writes these characters in such an openly comical manner that it's difficult not to love all of the characters in this story.  And, since he's the dominant character of this flick, he easily steals these scenes, meshing most enjoyably with Tony Danza - his vulgar, football watching father.  Finally, as far as the directing goes, you'd never suspect that this was Gordon-Levitt's first feature in the directing chair - smartly incorporating several porn clips and videos to impose his messages.

Gordon-Levitt's character (complete with Guido look and vocabulary) is only as strong as the supporting characters around him, including the incredibly attractive Scarlett Johansson - complete with Jersey accent and constant gum-chewing.  Johansson's casting is easily understandable and she plays her part well, but the casting of Academy Award nominee Julianne Moore is much more questionable.  Her acting ability in this film is not in question, and she's masterful as always, but she's nearly 20 years older than Gordon-Levitt, making her an odd choice for a female lead in a film starring a far younger cast.  Regardless, the supporting cast is extremely charming, led by the humorous Tony Danza - portraying an F-Bomb dropping father, and Brie Larson, portraying Gordon-Levitt's silent, constantly texting sister.  And, while it may appear that she's just in the family scenes for show, she turns out to be one of the most impactful characters in the film.

Overall, Don Jon is a smart, raunchy comedy that will make you blush and leave you laughing from its brutal amount of irony.  This film has created an endless amount of buzz (and praise) for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as he literally has his finger on every meaningful aspect of this film.  However, this film is strictly for a younger crowed, or at least a crowd that is comfortable with a tremendous amount of sexual discussion - not to mention constant porn clips.  Even though this film is speaking to where we are as a society, Don Jon stays true to the story it's telling - focusing less on romantic relationships and more on the conflict of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character.  This film truly is a remarkably entertaining feat for Gordon-Levitt and it's impossible not to look forward to his next writing/directing/acting endeavor.

5825211,4,B00DL477I0,"It's surely just coincidence, but this makes two weekends in a row that Hollywood releases a movie dealing with sex addition. Last weekend there was ""Thanks for Sharing"" (starring Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow). Now this.

""Don Jon"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Jon (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Jersey boy who loves his body, his pad, his family, his church, his boys, his women and... his porn. In the beginning of the movie Jon and his boys are hanging out at a club, and Jon notices and gets to know Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson), ""the prettiest thing I've ever seen"" comments Jon. THey hit if off. THings almost get derailed when Barbara spots Jon watching pron, but he gets away with it because ""it was just a joke"". At Barbara's insistance, Jon then starts going to night school (so that he can move up in society). There he gets to know Esther (played by Julianna Moore). To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Coupld of comments: first and foremost, this is the Joseph Gordon-Levitt show all the way. he stars (in fact he is in every single scene of the movie), and he also is the writer and director of the movie (his directing debut). Second, while the first half of the movie certainly is fun and loose (with tongue firmly planted in cheek), the dark and serious undertones are more and more accentuated as the movie progresses. Don Jon (Jon's nickname) has a serious addiction problem (the original title of the movie was ""Don Jon's Addiction""), and he knows it. At one point Barbara hisses to him ""I thought you were different, but you aren't"", and Jon knows he needs to face up to his addiction. Third, setting aside Joseph Gordon-Levitt for a minute, most other acting performances in ""Don Jon"" are simply ace. Scarlett Johansson is your perfect Jersey girl (she reminded me in every which way of Mariah Carey 15-20 years ago). Julianna Moore as the older woman will surprise you with the depth of her performance in this fairly small role. Tony Danza is perfect as the overbearing Jersey dad. And check out Brie Larson as Jon's sister (she has a breakout role in ""Short Term 12"" which I saw just a few weeks ago).

I had seen the trailer of this a few times and couldn't wait to see it. I caught it at a matinee showing today here in Cincinnati, and was surprised how well attended this showing was, given the topic of the movie. If you ask me which of ""Thanks for Sharing"" or ""Don Jon"" is the better movie, I must go with ""Don Jon"". It is simply the higher quality, and certainly the more entertaining, movie of the two. I couldn't believe when the lights came on, as ""Don Jon"" has simply flown by in no time. Beware: this is a raunchy comedy with serious undertones and with a fair amount of nudity, so if this offends you, save yourself the trouble (and money). But I'd say this is one of the better ""mainstream"" Hollywood releases that I've seen in quite a while.",1380240000,2,3010,4.519266055045872
5825212,5,B00DL477I0,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to grow as an artist. In this R-rated comedy (that he wrote and directed) he addresses some contemporary issues. The ubiquity of pornography has had a major impact on the dating game. Young men learn self-satisfaction and little else, while young women seek their own (maybe not sexual) self-satisfaction from other sources, e.g., chick flicks and shopping.

Several things jumped out at me: 1) The dialog coach was brilliant. Everyone in the cast had perfect Jersey accents, including the unique inflections. 2) Scarlett Johansson was amazing; she is the ultimate actress. 3) Do all Catholics keep score each week so their confessions are accurate? If so, why is the penance always the same?

Take a look at these players:
  * Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Premium Rush"") is the legendary horndog who comes to realize that his expectations for a partner are unrealistic because they are based on porno films. His weekly routine always includes church on Sunday (and that itemized confession).
  * Scarlett Johansson (""The Avengers"") plays the woman of his dreams. She even gets him to buy curtain rods!
  * Julianne Moore (""What Maisie Knew"") is in our hero's class; every young man should have a classmate like her!
  * Tony Danza (Lots of TV) will make you groan when you see his response to his son's date.
  * Glenne Headly (""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"") makes a pasta dish for Sunday dinner every week. She looks like a grandmother but has no grandchildren to show for it!
  * Brie Larson (""21 Jump Street"") is our hero's texting sister who finally opens her mouth and speaks!

Be warned that this is about pornography, so it includes a LOT of film clips; it is about young, single men in the dating game, so it includes a LOT of profanity; it is about growing up, so it includes a lot of confusion and humor. But I LOVED the don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them cameos by extremely well-known contemporaries who obviously got a big kick out of helping their friend.

The theater was packed with young adult couples. I hope they learned something! I'm sure Amazon's DVD will have captions. Whew!",1379462400,2,2125,4.926966292134831
5825223,2,B00DL477I0,"I can't say this is a bad movie exactly, but I know it's not a good one either. It's a tweener due to various issues a first time feature maker runs into. This movie is about the challenges you face attempting to have a real romantic relationship these days and specifically how fantasy of various types can hinder that.  The elephant in the room about this movie is the fact that pieces of porn films are included in this. Of course no explicit footage is shown in these clips, but the fact they're in there is problematic for people. I think this was a mistake by Gordon-Levitt. It was unnecessary to take it that far and basically make the film a commercial for an adult website. The film doesn't directly endorse pornography, but it doesn't denounce it either. As this is a hot button topic in our society, I think he didn't engage it very well. Seeing as he wrote this, he can't blame it on anyone else. The other type of film he criticizes is romantic comedies and romance novel type fantasies. Basically, these fantasies make normal sexual relations less appealing because we buy into the selfish fantasies and usually many of them at that. With all this said, the movie isn't really all that moralizing it's simply about how valid people's lives are due to being content with less.  Spoiler Alert! Don ends up with someone he cares about and he gives up the porn for a bit. None of this really matters and it's because the characters aren't interesting. The movie isn't really about them, but a series of object lessons. As a first time film maker, I think he should try to commit himself to telling s story well  as the primary goal.  It's clearly a goal he isn't trying to meet here.",1517961600,,1693,4.504885993485342

But I wanted to learn something so I watched anyways. After finishing, I still think the same thing. Levitt could have just had the sounds from porn in the background with him narrating and all the audience would have known exactly what was happening in the clips. That being said, I really like how it ended. After totally giving up porn, Jon was able to find that real, deep relationship he wanted, and that I'm sure most men really want. This was the main message of the movie and I know from the guys in my life doing the same, it is very true! Perhaps in future movies, they will dive more into how porn and our culture makes women into not just objects but sexual ones and how that effects how they are viewed by all the men in their lives who consume it; brothers, friends, dads, co-workers etc. Like Jon claimed in the movie, ""Every guy watches porn every day.""

5825321,4,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon
 Jon Martelo tends bar somewhere in New Jersey.  He and his pals meet and bed young women that they meet in a dance club.  They are young, callow, energetic and not very serious about much of anything.  He also has a serious addition to pornography.  His addiction and the complications that arise from it prevent the natural maturation process that men his age typically experience.
 Does that sound nice and sanitary?  This film has nothing sanitary about it.  The very hard R rating has been well earned.  This film pushes the R rating about as close to a full bore XXX rating as you can get without getting into actual porn.  I have warned you.  If very frank, blue collar talk and action in the sexual area offends you, stay away.  The characters are working class New Jersey folk with no speech code.
  Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Angles in the Outfield and Third Rock from the Sun has grown up.  He both wrote and directed this $6 million budget three saw blade film.  He also appears as the star.  He plays the Jon the bartender, who his friends dub Don Jon in homage to his success with girls.  He never dates the same girl twice, and why should he?  An endless parade of hopeful young girls comes into their chosen nightclub.  All is well until Scarlett Johansson enters.  Before long he takes night classes, forsakes other women and generally gets ready for the next stage of his life.  His horrible flaw is his addition to porn.  It interferes with his emotional growth.  He prefers the fantasy to the reality.  He tragically screws up his relationship with Scarlett Johansson because of his twists.
 We love movies because they teach us something and entertain at the same time.  He meets an older, wiser woman, Julianne Moore, who helps him with his maturation process.  Most of us at one time or another could have used Julianne Moore to come along and help us to understand some of lifes complications.  Tony Danza has a limited role as Dons father.  The two are great as they argue at top volume at the family table while wearing matching wife beater undershirts.  Johansson shows again her acting skills as she leads her fellah around, molding him into the man she actually wants.  She does it with a very credible Jersey accent and style.
 There is a great deal to like in this one hour and 30 minute film.  It has taken in some $23 million so far.  For other and not so R rated films with Joseph Gordon-Levitt I recommend Brick and 500 Days of Summer.  Gordon-Levitt balances his big budget films with little independent films, some of which are quite good.",1470960000,,2583,4.587719298245614

So the movie did a good job at delivering that message and letting it be known that what you see in porn is just fantasy and what you see in romance movies is just fantasy... for the most part.

That is until he meets the lovely Barbara played by the lovely Scarlett Johansson. Things are going great until she discovers him with his porn and suddenly things take a turn for the worse.

5825639,2,B00DL477I0,"You don't have to adore a main character for a movie to be successfully enjoyable. It doesn't help when you actually hate the main character.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is usually so enjoyable, from his stint on 3rd Rock as a kid all the way up to his indie shots in Brick and Hesher, even in the morally depressing 50/50.  Then we get Don Jon, written and directed by the man himself and we stare in awe, not admiration, mostly well-deserved contempt.  Don Jon comes off punkish and juvenile.  Don Martello is a low-brow meat-headed miscreant who has earned the title of Don Jon (ala Don Juan for people too imbecilic to differentiate between the two) from his socially-retarded friends for his ability to bed vacuous but beautiful club rats.  But for Don, that doesn't really matter.  What he prefers is porn.  That's what gets him really going.  Porn.  Then he meets Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) at the club and she doesn't immediately fall for him like the other empty-headed bimbos so he is enamored.  He Facebook stalks her and the two begin to date.  Don's parents, a testosterone-driven, wife-beater-wearing douchey goombah version of Tony Danza and a worn-out, doting, clueless mother version of Glenne Headly, love Barbara.  Everything seems to be on track.  Don is infatuated with the gorgeous, no-nonsense, street-talking Barbara but he can't give up his blessed porn.  Of course he gets caught and of course Barbara is mystified and mortified.  What kind of creep did she let in her life?  Meanwhile. Don hooks up with a creepy older chick (a cracked-out-looking, mental-baggage-toting Julianne Moore) in his adult education class.  Someday he figures out that love and porn are not on the same planet.  Look, I appreciate an original idea, especially in the anemic Hollywood of the last decade, but this movie is so far off the mark it's pathetic.  First off, Gordon-Levitt's character is reminiscent of an episode of Jersey Shore.  I was waiting for something terrible to happen to him, something involving a maiming car accident or a bout with cancer that would leave him emaciated and vomiting up his intestines.  His character is a goon, a dolt, the worst kind of mental midget imaginable and then Johansson's character, seeing what kind of a douche he is, hooks up with him and is surprised to find that he's a douche.  That made no sense.  Was she that completely stupid, having met his leering, hormonal father?  All the signs were there.  This movie was just  sludge.  Something that was supposed to be cutting-edge (why, because it's profane on every imaginable level, especially with its stupidity?) and fell flat as just trying to be shocking.  Gordon-Levitt needs to go back to the drawing board.  He's worked with amazing actors and directors and writers and he just laid a rotten egg.

5825730,5,B00DL477I0,"At first glance, this movie appears to be a low-brow comedy about pornography and other lurid matters.  However, this film is deeply contemplative and highly moral.

Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a working class New Jersey man of Italian extraction.  He is almost a ""Guido"" but he is self-discliplined, with deep loyalties to his friends, family, body, and church.  Jon has an addiction to pornography.  He finds porn better than sex with real women.  Every week Jon goes to Church and has confession getting a somewhat arbitrary penance for a list of sins which he repeats again and again-the main sins being sex outside marriage, and pornography.  One day he meets Barbara Sugarman
(Scarlett Johansson), a Jersey girl also of working class roots.  Jon courts Barbara in the ""traditional"" way of modern America.  The courtship, however is dependent upon Jon not watching porn-on their first night sleeping together, Barbara caught Jon indulging in the habit.

The relationship between Barbara and Jon continues to grow.  Barbara gets Jon to commit to taking night courses, where he meets Esther (Julianne Moore).  Esther is older, of a somewhat higher social class and is not Italian.  She appears to be more of a WASPy Protestant.  Esther mysteriously cries in various points throughout the movie and we later learn that she is a recent widow who lost her husband and son in an accident.

The above is plot, the contemplative part of the movie is the relationship between Barbara, Jon, pornography and ""RomComs.""  Barbara appears to be the perfect match for Jon, but while Jon recognizes that porn is a vice, Barbara doesn't realize her romantic movies are pornography directed towards women, but with a far more sinister effect.  Romance books, movies, etc. portray an idealized type of relationship in which the woman is swept along by an idealized, but falsely portrayed man who has all the attributes of a perfect romantic partner.  Barbara has taken her addiction to RomComs and it has made her into a shrewish manipulator who causes Jon to give up much, but offers Jon nothing in return.

After Barbara discovers Jon is continuing to watch porn she dumps him.  Jon goes to Esther.  Esther is far more relaxed about porn and sex and she brings Jon to a healing and healthy relationship.

This situation deserves additional reflection, Barbara has lost a potential husband due to her exacting standards.  Essentially, perfect has become the enemy of good enough.  She is now older but no wiser and without a marriage prospect.

The story itself  really brings one into a contemplative state of mind.  We live in a world where social interactions of the most advanced and intimate forms can be brought by electronic means it becomes important to know what social interactions are important and real vs. which ones are fantasy.  If anything this movie acknowledges porn as a vice and takes idealized Romantic relationship movies and such to task for their damaging effects or real relationships.  Additionally, in America's current class-ridden and snobbish cultural climate, this move portrays working class people in a highly sympathetic light.",1421539200,2,3159,5.079611650485437
5825731,4,B00DL477I0,"I was surprised at how much I liked this film. Honestly, I don't see where all the bad reviews are coming from. Maybe some viewers got the wrong impression from the movie trailer, which markets this flick as more of a romantic comedy and less of a dramedy. In any case, I took a chance after reading a ton of less than stellar opinions online and I'm really glad I did. The film delves into the differences between sex and intimacy without being too preachy. It has a wonderful message about how both sexes build up high expectations - men through pornography and women through romantic movies - that are impossible to achieve in real life; thus setting the stage for a lifetime of failed relationships. It's only when Jon lets go of those unrealistic expectations, looks beyond physical perfection, and loses himself completely in another human being that he finally reaches fulfillment. There is a lot of nudity and sexually suggestive material in this film, mainly whenever Jon is watching porn...which he does a lot because he's addicted to it. So maybe not a good choice for a ""first date"" movie, but I would definitely recommend it to a more seasoned couple looking for something interesting to watch together. It's one of those openly provocative movies that's deceptively deep once you delve beneath the surface. It will make you think and you'll no doubt stay up talking about it long after the final credits have ended.",1421280000,,1429,4.7894736842105265

Where it falls apart is the story.

I'm nowhere near as hard on this as I've seen a few other reviewers be. Personally, I though the set-up worked. But the solution? Nope. Too easy.

I'd say a lot more about that, but I don't want to spoil it for you if you plan to see it anyway. I understand why this film was so important to Mr. Gordon-Levitt: It's about how addiction hides in our everyday lives, how pornography and other shallow ways of consuming the world rot away a person's insides. That's cool. It *is* important.

Which is why he should have exercised the self-restraint to wait until he'd written and made a few other feature-lengths before going from story to screen on this one.",1415145600,,830,4.703448275862069
5825834,2,B00DL477I0,"What a ""lost"" and immature movie.  Don Jon is nothing special, in fact he fits the stereotypical guy in society.  Don Jon is a 30-something year old guy that sleeps with multiple woman and watches porn.  How original of a story-line can we get here, wow???  He encounters his ""10"" (Scarlett Johansson) at a club and quickly gets involved in a relationship that was doomed from the beginning.  The two start dating and she encounters he watched porn and calls him out on it, yet he lies to continue their dysfunctional relationship.  As the the movie continues she discovers more pornography and he finally ends the lies and admits he watches it.  She leaves him, meanwhile he goes back to his old dirty tricks of having sex with random women and lies to his unsympathetic friends and family as to why he parted from her.  He couldn't man-up and be honest with anyone, other than a priest at the confession booth and a grieving cougar.

Enter Grieving Cougar: Don Jon encounters Esther (Julianne Moore), she is nothing more than a grieving woman that needs attention.  The two establish a dysfunctional relationship using one another for ""love"" and attention.

 On another note; the Tony Danza at the dinner table scenes were over-the-top ringing to my ears.  The sister's attempt to make Don Jon feel good about the break-up wasn't deep, rather it was disappointing.

To conclude, the film wasn't horrific, it held my attention (2 stars), but it lacked depth in the characters as well as the script.  Furthermore this movie doesn't connect with a wide audience, it's more isolated for single people and/or a younger audience, therefore it's out of touch.  Nonetheless, I didn't really care for any of the characters, and thankfully I'm happy the characters lacked depth, because it would have been a longer movie of selfish, needy, and horny behavior beyond what I already watched.... The word ""lost"" kept coming into play toward the end in describing Don Jon and Esther's objectives, yet I was lost figuring out why he directed an unoriginal and porn-addicted movie.",1414368000,,2067,4.8796561604584525

5825888,5,B00DL477I0,"Lets get this out of the way right from the start:  if you will be offended by a movie with lots of F-bombs and/or one thats about a guy from Jersey whos addicted to pornor more specifically, masturbating to pornthen Don Jon isn't for you.  That said, theres a lot to like about Joseph Gordon-Levitts feature debut as Writer/Director and as starring actor.

Don Jon doesnt waste any time letting us know what its about.  Theres nothing subtle in an opening that shows Joseph Gordon-Levitts character, Jon Martello, masturbating to porn.  His matter-of-fact voiceover explains precisely what he likes about getting off to porn and why he prefers the women on the screen to actual warm-bodied women in his bed.  His friends call him Don, though, because he manages to score dimesmeaning a 10whenever they go out.

Enter Scarlett Johansson (for whom Gordon-Levitt wrote the role) as Barbara, a 10 in any movie, but especially in this one.  Its a jolt initially to hear her accentwhich some argue sounds more like one from Staten Islandbut if you're not from New Jersey, you won't have a problem with it.  Barbara is the game changer for Jon, perfect in every way, except for one minor problem:  shes not happy about the porn.

Julianne Moore and Tony Danza round out a stellar cast that includes cameos from Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.  Danza plays Jons dad in a performance reminiscent of (and just as strong as) Robert De Niros fatherly role in Silver Linings Playbook.  Moore plays a middle-aged student in a night class with Jon.  She provides an older woman foil for Jons girlfriend/porn issuessomeone other than his buddies and family to heckle and care for him.  Moore gives a layered performance, ably demonstrating the disappearing effect of age when hanging out with students half her age, gracefully revealing that there is much more under the tender shell of her character Esther than Jon can possibly imagine.

Gordon-Levitts screenplay is solid and well structured, built around themes like the fact that Jon Martello is a devout Catholic.  With welcome regularity, we see Jon back on the pew with his family, followed by a weekly rendezvous in the confessional in which he itemizes his sexual transgressions to the priest on the other sidethe number of times he had sex out of wedlock, how many times he masturbated to porn, etc.  The next scene invariably shows him in the gym working out to the prescribed number of Hail Marys and Our Fathers (and we get to peek at just how buff Gordon-Levitt has been keeping himself).  The laughs get louder every time the screenplay whips around to this place keeper, and we fall into pace with Jon and his routine as we get to know him.

Gordon-Levitt takes what should be a ridiculous premise for a movie and through strong writing and directing outputs a sincere plot.  Though full of the American Pie-style humor requisite for a story about masturbation, Don Jon more importantly takes its characters (and us) somewhereand its not where you think.  In the wasteland of cookie-cutter movie plots, Don Jons story is a breath of fresh airone that makes us laugh, makes us think, makes us cringe, and makes us come out wanting more from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",1413763200,,3234,4.841818181818182

5825891,2,B00DL477I0,"His friends supposedly call him Don Jon because of all the girls he gets, but a) they don't use the nickname often enough to back up Jons claims, and b) the film is more about Jons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) addiction to online porn and how it interferes with his reality, as opposed to focusing on the girls he actually scores with, so the movies title should have been something like Fantasy-Addled Jon, as opposed to Don Jon.  But I digress.

Several folks, including the late legendary film critic Roger Ebert and the Italian-American One Voice Coalition, took issue with the fact that JGL, who both wrote and directed the film (which was also produced by his hitRECord production company), wrote a script that contained numerous racist stereotypes of Italian Americans.  Of course, the idiots on Jersey Shore can make millions of dollars for doing the same gym, tan, laundry routine and no one gives them guff, but JGL tries something similar and takes the heat.  Makes sense.

In any event, there are some elements that were a bit over-the-top when it came to the depiction of a typical Italian-American family, like how the men in the family wear matching wife-beaters while relaxing at home.  Or how every dinner conversation erupts into an argument in front of the football-emitting television.  Or how Jon is so hot-tempered that he consistently road-rages, even punching out some guys window with, ultimately, zero repercussions.

But don't worry, his sins are washed clean away every week when he goes to church and claims hes sorry for the things hes done and will continue to do again anyway the following week.

What is perhaps most annoying about the whole controversy is that Jons Jersey Shore clone adds nothing to the story.  Jon could have been any other douchebag who hangs out in clubs and brings home the first hoodrat he sees.  We could have even done without meeting his family because they didn't bring anything to the story either.

I prefer JGL in his 500 Days of Summer mode - hell, Ill even take Looper JGL.  His portrayal here did nothing for his resume - at least as far as his acting credits are concerned.  Though, if the critics are to be acknowledged, the film didn't help his writing or directing cred either.

The plot of Don Jon isn't much more than Jon masturbating furiously to internet porn, of which we see plenty of in spliced shots, and then ultimately losing his hot girlfriend (Scarlett Johansson) because he simply cant help himself, claiming that masturbating to porn is better than real sex.

You think that shell (Barbara) be Jons porn fantasy come to life and that hell never need digital stimulation again, but no.  The one woman who can finally break him of his habit is...Julianne Moore?  Dafuq?  Because we totally believe that a guy like Jon would alter the course of his life for a woman who is old enough to be his mother, a guy who can only get his rocks off otherwise to pornstar-looking women - right. Though, at least he doesnt have to worry about committing to her, and thats probably the whole point.  Still, Id like to see his familys reaction to that one.",1413244800,3,3118,4.728280961182994

5825896,5,B00DL477I0,"I believe this movie is genius. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an amazing job at portraying the unrealistic expectations both genders bring to romantic relationships.
Barbara watches all these romantic films which sell her a fairy tale that is not true, and she believes that a guy would ""give it all up for her if he really loved her"", she expects him to change and give up things he likes to do, and yes the biggest deal was about porn, because she thinks he should not be watching all those women when all the attention should be focused on her. HOWEVER, she also criticizes minor things, such as the fact that he enjoys cleaning his apartment, or says his prayers during his workout, she wants him to get a different job, etc.

On the other hand Jon thinks that the key to happiness is to have a trophy girlfriend, ""the prettiest thing he's ever seen"" so maybe with her he will have the kind of sex he sees in porn and that will make him happy, so he stays with Barbara, despite the fact that she wants to change him and make him give up things he likes (again, porn was the deal breaker, but she also was bothered by other harmless habits) to do for her.

After Barbara dumps him, connecting with Esther not only makes him realize that he had unrealistic expectations about sex and relationships, but he also realizes that he was not happy with Barbara, and that what makes him happy is having a true connection with someone who accepts him for who he is and he does the same back for her.
Barbara, however, does not change her views and tells him the same things we hear all over ""that he is selfish and cannot have a relationship"" because he does not meet her also one-sided expectations so she tells him not to call her anymore.",1411171200,4,1739,4.414330218068536

5825984,1,B00DL477I0,"I do not understand what the producer of this movie was trying to accomplish. If the goal was to make a tragic comedy consisting of the different skewered viewpoints of sex/pornography... the whole thing pretty much imploded on itself while acomplishing nothing.

 First off, I would like to add to the comment that one reviewer had already stated about Julianna Moore's character. If ""Don Jon"" was truely the porn addict that he was, he would not give up his virtual harem of fantasy women in exchange for a GILF like Julianna Moore. Think about it; he got bored with Scarlett Johansen, but suddenly a woman pushing 50 satisfies his insatiable lust? Unbelievable.

 Second, there was another aspect about Moore's character that really irked me. I don't know if this was to portray hypocrisy intentionally, or if the producer is just this stupid: One of the first lines from Moore is that she ""should have gotten high before class"", and then a few moments later she has the nerve to call Don a ""junkie"" and that he has ""desensitized himself."" Huh. So if you watch too much porn, you are a junkie, but smoke all the weed you like: no problem.

 Third, Moore made a statement to Don that he should watch (some porn title) from the 60s because it's ""hot and artistic"" and ""not like the sh*t you guys are watching today."" Newsflash lady; supporting the  ""hot and artistic"" porn of the 60s is what lead to the ""sh*t guys are watching today. It's all about the nature of the beast when it comes to addiction; it is never sated and must always up the ante in order to get the same high. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Did the producer even do any research on addictive behaviors?

 Lastly, the entertainment industry has beat this dead horse to the point that there would only be a few bloody bits left. Catholicisim.... HOW ORIGINAL!!! I guess no one from any other different religon or background has hangups about sex. Nope. Just the Catholics. Strictly them and NO ONE ELSE. Really? Did the writers of this script truely believe that their viewers would be THAT dumb? Oh, but just to really make a statement, we get Italian actor Tony ""Who's The Boss"" Danza to make an apperance in this nonsense, slurping spaghetti with a crucifix hanging in the background. Can we say sterotype? By the way AS a Catholic, I can tell you that the depiction of the Church was (oh shock) inadequetly portrayed:

 1.)  Priests are not just members of the religous community, they are psychologists as well as doctors of the church. It takes them twelve years to become ordained.

 2.)  The purpose of the sacrament of Reconciliation is not just to ""confess""... or as anti-Catholics like to brand ""feel guilty""; it is to seek reassurance and support, and often times you will learn a piece of wisdom that you wouldn't have discovered by yourself.

 Twelve years of psychology and religous doctrine. These men are not stupid. When Don brought up the point of not masturbating all week, but having premarital sex once and why he recives the same penance (which on a side note, sex with another person outside of marriage is considered a more serious sin as opposed to self-gratification within Catholic teaching) the priest would explain more rather than just  speel ""Have faith my son."" Remember: twelve years of study. They've heard it all before.

 3.) Within Catholic dogma, it is taught that when an individual is compelled to do something AKA addicted (not just pornography, but drugs, gambling etc.) they are not held accountable in the same way as those without addictions because the aspect of free will has been removed. In order for something to be a sin, it must be fully acknowledged and of one's free will. Many men with pornographic addiction became introduced to the habit as boys not knowing or understanding the nature of what was happening; as a result an addiction develops over the years which takes away the element of free will. In short, the Catholic church does not have the viewpoint of  ""pornographic addiction = going to Hell.""

 How do I know all of these things? Because I lived a life like Don Jon and I recieved the following consolation from a priest.

5826112,2,B00DL477I0,"Hope you can take my opinion on the film without flipping out on me. The movie started off so great, but I didn't like the way it ended. I mean it was realistic the way it was set up (most of it).
You see the way the movie interprets how relationships, men and some women are like in real life is accurate. Most men watch porn and most women watch romance movies where the guy and girl fall in love at first sight, date, make love, fight, get mad at each other, break up, get sad, cry, and in the end have a revelation where they see the error of each others' ways, get back together again, and possibly be together for the rest of their life. However, that doesn't happen in the film (besides the film within the film). That's a good thing because I can see people want relationships like that, but never like that in real life. I like the concept and realism in it. But....... I was hoping Joseph Gordon Levitt's and Scarlett Johanson's characters would end up apologizing to each other, saying they were wrong to one and another, kiss, make up, and get back together again. But then again, that wouldn't be realistic and would be ironic. Instead, after the two break up in the MIDDLE of the film, he starts making a connection with this lady (Julianne Moore) at the night class he goes to, make a connection, and making love. That pretty much happened throughout the rest of the film and ended right there. After Johanson left, I cringed through the rest of the movie. Didn't like how he ended up with Ester. I'm sure Julianne Moore is a good actress, but pairing her with Levitt's character later in the film doesn't feel right. To me, she just feels like a side-character. Not too relevant. Can't believe I wasted an hour and a half watching this movie. It's ridiculous. Overall, Don Jon gets a 3/10. Save your money people. There are other good movies out there. Don Jon is just not one of them. Also, you can watch sexy Scarlett Johanson in her other films. You'll find her more appealing and more talented in other motion pictures besides this one.

5826114,4,B00DL477I0,"Humorous and unexpectedly insightful film starring and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, with Scarlett Johansson.  The film is tasked with making us care about two fairly one dimensional people who start out basically made for and deserving each other, then falling apart via Johansson finding gigolo G-L perusing pornography on the internet long after he pledged to be both honest and stay away from porn.  Don Jon forces us to think about the role online pornography plays in relationships, albeit rather clumsily and with Johansson adopting a bitchy, unwavering approach to the relationship after just a few weeks.

With strong performances by both leads, as well as a fairly undeveloped turn as a troubled widow by Julianne Moore, the movie manages to surmount its crassness and soft core to make us think about how this relatively new media affects our romantic and sexual relationships.  The ending is a bit contrived and not all that believable but it doesn't betray Don Jon's original premise.  The family scenes with Tony Danza are an exercise in extreme ethnic characterization but are really funny.

A strong R rating due to nudity and sexual themes.  I see people complain about the graphic nature of Don Jon, which makes me wonder if they ever bothered to watch the trailer.  I mean, come on folks, the movie is about PORN.",1405900800,,1336,4.986486486486487

There is Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a daily addiction to porn and admits he loves it more than sex with the real thing.  Why?  Because as he says, ""he loses himself"", whereas with the real thing he seems to just be going through the motions feeling nothing.  That is until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who makes him work for it, or I should say makes him work for her.  She's what he considers a 10 on the scale of the meat market.  Barbara loves all things romance and feels that if a guy really likes her, then he'll succumb to her allure and give her whatever she demands.  Jon forgets who he is and falls even further into addiction and unhappiness as he bows down to whatever Barbara requests, that is until he meets Esther (Julianne Moore) and older beautiful woman who is much more down to earth and understanding.  Esther manages to teach Jon how to finally lose himself and in this process, find himself.  This was an interestingly funny and at times dramatic movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.

OK, admittedly a  better than nothing viewpoint, but what in the world are they doing trotting out Julianne Moore, who, without the benefit of Hollywood lighting and makeup would send any potential male lover running out the door? Even with a makeup job that should win awards, I couldn't help but cringe at the idea of matronly Moore and Levitt, as Julianne is easily old enough to be his mother.

What was very well-done - besides the rapid-fire splicing of porn - was every time Scarlet Johansen acts in a negative manner, her makeup and lighting show her to be less than the perfect 10 she appears to be in the bar when they meet.

5826336,4,B00DL477I0,"I am struck by the polarization of reviews of this movie. 672 reviews, with 168 reviews giving 1 star. None of the one star reviews I read have any real content, they just all seem to say 'this movie was worthless'.

It is true, as many of the positive reviews have pointed out, that the main character treats women like objects. I would like to take the discussion a little deeper.

1. The key value of the movie, besides its being enjoyable entertainment (if marred a bit by Tony Danza and Glenne Headly's overacting) is its breaking of stereotypes about porn. The main character is very honest as to why he likes porn - focusing on his own pleasure, he says, is better than sex because when having sex, he feels confined to do what the women seem to want him to do and not ask for what he wants.  It could be said that although he presents himself as a macho guy who doesn't respect women, in reality he puts women on a pedestal. I would venture to guess that this is not an uncommon factor in creating what is so often called 'porn addiction'.  The stereotypical view of porn addiction that it simply defocuses the male away from his partner towards a 'perfect woman' or a '10' is somewhat challenged by the fact that this guy can have any woman he wants. The other aspect of porn addiction most often discussed, that the woman in porn will 'do anything the man wants', is well presented here, but with greater depth than most books on porn addiction have. Interesting feature for such a seemingly inconsequential movie!

2. The women the main character falls in love with only makes this worse for him by demanding , in princess like fashion , that he put her on even more of a pedestal. in fact, she treats him in a somewhat contempuous fashion, pushing him to be ambitious when he actually just isn't. This is because SHE is treating HIM like an object - the reason she demands that he never talk about cleaning, something which he is passionate about, is that it doesn't conform to her image of the perfect masculine man.

3. The reason that 'the sex is so great' with Julianne Moore is that she sees him as a whole person, with a balanced view of his good qualities and flaws, which catalyzes a change that causes him to see her (and women in general) more as whole people.

Until Barbara Sugarman comes along, a devastating Scarlet Johansen who manages to make herself seem unattractive by the sheer force of her characters worldview and agenda in attracting men. Is she a Jew? asks Jons mom Glenne Headly. When dad Tony Danza gets a look at her religious concerns take a back seat to her sheer hotness, which is represented as a commodity here, as it is in the porn that Jon watches incessantly. The central conceit of the movie, and the source of its comedy and its pathos, is the irony in Jons thinking that porn is realer than sex (because he loses himself in it) and in Barbs medieval thinking that Hollywood rom- coms in which the white knight sacrifices all for his lady friend isn't one-sided, too, as Jon tries to make clear to her.  (Theres a cute make believe movie in a movie early on called Special Someone starring Ann Hathaway as an actress called Emily Lombardo and Channing Tatum as Conner Vereauxnot much diff therethat gets Barb as hot as porn gets Jon off.) Enter Julianne Moores Esther, a sad woman with a secret, but an evolved woman who awakens Jon to the two-sidedness of human relations. Its corny, but it works, mainly because of the good acting all around, the snappy dialogue and editing, and especially the performance of JGL, whos become a real pro.

5826459,3,B00DL477I0,"The message is the film, and the style of story-telling proves the point of the film.  Any movie that relies on voice-overs is utilizing a technique that puts the viewer one step away from emotional involvement.  I suspect that given the subject matter of the film, this was done deliberately.  The story revolves around several characters and the objectifying attitudes they exhibit towards the opposite sex.  That objectifying reaches it's peak when the main character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) becomes addicted to pornography, and finds himself unable to achieve any type of genuine satisfaction without it.  I'm sure the subject matter produces any number of snickers from (particularly the young male) audience, but the fact is there is truth within the message.  The movie isn't preachy in the sense that it condemns pornography altogether, but it does have a point--and it doesn't just point the finger at men either (a refreshing change), when it comes to objectifying partners.  Women are also held accountable.  I particular enjoyed the third part of the film, and his evolving relationship with the older woman.  Not a love story, it's a tale of growing up, and of how to find a truly satisfying relationship by letting go of the false picture painted by ads and popular entertainment--particular entertainment that paints people as objects to be used for our own pleasure.",1398902400,,1381,5.15695067264574

Jon deals with his heightened sexual expectations that arise from his porn addiction.

5826466,3,B00DL477I0,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has the luxury of having been one of the few childhood actors that made it into the adult market. He goes one further here by both writing and directing this ambitious, if not entirely successful, film.

Here's the scoop. Don (Levitt) is a Jersey boy who is way into porn. It's sex without the involvement. He now finds himself in a relationship with a girl (Scarlett Johansson) that gets serious, and needs to choose between real people or fake porn. The situation is exacerbated when he runs into a slightly older woman (Julianne Moore) who puts another spin on the ball.

This is a genuinely enjoyable movie. Levitt has crafted a nifty character. He's a likeable sort with a large degree of self discipline. His only downside is his addiction to porn. But he has his reasons for his enjoyment and he articulates them well. But now he's involved with the real deal (or so he thinks) and it's a tightrope of a walk. And Moore's character puzzles him even further.

This is directed and acted well. Even Ton Danza, whom I'd given up on, turns in a fine performance. Glenne Headly is always a pleasure to watch. Seeing Scarlett Johannson as a Jersey Jewish princess really got me. I've never seen her in a role like this and she excels.

The problem here is the script itself. There is both a story and character arc but it arcs a bit too quickly. There needed to be more instances that were smaller and more subtle that add to Don's change. And it just barely ends. It more just kind of stops.

For a first outing this is a heck of an effort. I'd be interested to see where he goes next.",1398729600,4,1608,4.474402730375426

There is a good message here and I am glad I watched this movie. It was worth wading through the Jersey Shore, GTL bs to see the light at the end of the porn tunnel for Jon's character.

Don Jon also missed an opportunity to thank his ex for dumping him, he really should have.  He could've been snarky about it or whatever, but the fact is he should be thankful and should have at least given her some credit for how that eventually helped him learn about himself.

5826576,3,B00DL477I0,"In his debut as a director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Jon Martello or Don Jon, a modern-day Don Juan living in New Jersey. Well, sort of. This is a comedy or satire featuring a man who sleeps with a different woman every weekend, but what he likes most is porno videos on the internet.

One day he meets a beautiful girl Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) at a dance club. This time Jon takes their relationship seriously, but he is not still satisfied. Jon watches porno but Barbara just doesnt like it. In the meanwhile, in a night class he takes, Jon meets another woman Esther (Julianne Moore), who later gives him some advice.

I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Here he casts himself against type in the lead role as a ladys man, and to his credit he did a decent job. It is good acting. The problem is, it is too obvious that he is acting. The same can be said about supporting characters including Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as Jons parents.

Don Jon is confident and edgy, to be sure, and makes its point fast. Once we get it, however, we start to realize that characters are all one-dimensional caricatures. After this happens, there is not much that the film can offer..",1396742400,,1172,4.545023696682464
5826577,4,B00DL477I0,"First, I've never written a review, so please bear with me.  Second I really like JGL, so I wanted this to be a great movie; it wasn't.  BUT I believe it was what he (JGL) more or less intended it to be.  A unpolished look at a subculture.  Was his character unlikeable?  At first yes, but I liked Scarlett Johansson's character less.  Were their New Jersey accents overdone?  Maybe, though growing up in RI... there are areas where our accents are much stronger than others.  Was the sister silent until the end? Yes, but I thought it worked.  She took everything in and spoke up for her brother when it made the greatest impact on the family.  Montages repetitive?  Yes, but the movie trailer indicates this... Jon's life IS somewhat repetitive.  The ending rushed?  I agree, only because Jon became more likable and I wanted to see more of his new attitude and newfound relationship with Julianne Moore.  Oh and the masturbation scenes?  Not a fan, though thankfully they weren't graphic and the throwing of a tissue was kinda funny as you saw 1 then 2 then 3 in the trash.  Lastly regarding his faith.  You can see that there is a slight disconnect as he questions why his penance never really changes though his ""sins"" do.  He does question the priest but the curtain slides closed.  Bottom line, I liked it and I still really like JGL.  It truly it is what it claims to be, a movie about a guy whose life is singular in routine and manages to learn a life lesson at the end.",1396742400,,1480,4.451492537313433

It's obvious I had high expectations and they were definitely met.
Hearing other people's negative opinions, including my own friends who claim it's just a two hour porno, makes me realize that they aren't watching this as an art form.
Don Jon is a unique perspective of love from the modern male youth. It tells what happens to men's minds when they begin to believe all the sex in the media and expect it in real life.
Each character is so well thought out and played perfectly by the actors. And Don Jon's development is so beautiful, and hidden in the small details like how different he drives his car every time we see him driving.
I'm a screenwriter and so it may be easy for me to look at the beauty in this, but it's truly Joseph Gordon-Levitt's subtle masterpiece.",1396569600,,964,4.391061452513966

interesting
A modern Saturday Night Fever,  with a few twists and some small amount of philosophy. I found the film thought provoking,
especially after getting through the beginning which could make one think it was going to be a topical low brow comedy.
 Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and starred in in Don Jon and it is my opinion that he pushed the envelope a little.
 Be warmed that one of the main themes is porno and porno addiction.
 Gordon-Levitt comes up with an alternative to porno in the story but it did not ring completely true although the sentiment was admirable. I thought the cast was great, all on the same page. Although I found some flaws in the ending, trying wrap it up with a happy ending that did not ring true, I am giving the film 5 stars (it is a 4 to 4 1/2) because this film deserves more than the 3 it has, people get turned off very easily by one thing or another and the beginning of this movie could do that.

Like any addiction, porn indeed destroys lives and this film hit the nail on the head.  Kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for directing this and his stellar acting job.
True to Hollywood fashion, the Catholic church is not portrayed in a good light at all.  Not every priest is as insensitive as the one portrayed in this film.  There are priests out there who can help you kick this and other addictions. Unfortunately, our media only likes to report on the bad priests.
So my review is mixed.  The typecast NJ family in this film cracks me up and was acted well.

5826631,5,B00DL477I0,"I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt since he was a kid on Third Rock from the Sun. Following his career from Fifty/Fifty to a supporting role as Robert Lincoln, son of Daniel Day Lewis' President Lincoln, I've always found his skills impressive. He doesn't disappoint in Don Jon. Jon ought to have been cast in Jersey Shore, he's just that much of a Guido. His life revolves around gym, tan laundry and scoring Guidettes in the Jersey clubs he lives in with his friends. In short, Jon is a perfect Bro. He has his posse, his family (the scenes with Tony Danza as his dad are not to be missed), his church, and his narcissism, the last of which could have sunk this film in the hands of a less talented actor. Oh, and did I mention he has his porn? Lots and lots of it. He's addicted to the film dollies he punches out of his computer. No real woman can ever top these babes for him, not even when there's a real woman right there, ready and willing. It's sort of sickly fascinating to watch his obsession with fantasy babes, and his confession that no real woman can take their place. He's got a problem, a monkey on. well not his back, but somewhere else. Of course, he doesn't see this as problem. Until he meets the gum clacking big haired Guidette of his dreams (a typecast Scarlett Johannsen)
and falls in love. What's not to like? His family adores her, his friends are a tiny bit jealous,his confessions to his priest a tad more boring,  and all seems to be going well until she discovers his porn fixation. No surprise there, she's repulsed, and she talks him into taking night classes to improve his career options and keep him away from the plastic dollies. There he meets Juilet Lewis,
whose raw grief from the recent loss of her son and husband in a car crash repulse him. Besides, she's older and no Guidette and certainly no computer dolly. But a casual meeting will change Jon's life. A good film, well done, with some fine acting and a good script. Not for the kiddies, but watch it.",1395705600,,2003,4.398921832884097

5826848,4,B00DL477I0,"From the beginning it's obvious that this is not for kids, extremely religious, prudes, church groups thinking it's a romantic take that don't watch porn, or the overly sensitive expecting a bland romance film. It shows a lot of brief clips from porn with some quick topless nudity with sounds. There's some sort-of explicit brief simulated sex scenes. There are so many mixed reviews, most not saying why they liked it or not, that I decided to see for myself. I did not want to watch this because the tagline and many reviews described it as being completely against porn. For the perspective of my review as a masculine guy, I'm pro-women (women can vote, drive, not be forced to stay home, have a career), I'm pro-sex (not repressive sex-negative), believe in sexual freedom for men and women, in favor of most normal porn, and therefore would not want to spend money on a totally anti-porn sex-negative movie. Thus, as a man I was prepared to dislike this movie (not as the puritanical dislike it because of some language and brief clips) but because it sounded extremely anti-porn, however I liked much of it. The tagline and most reviews are using this film to one sided blame everything on porn, whereas even the director JGL has said it is not just about porn, it's about relationships. The directing of JGL was good. All the acting was good and there was some comedy that not everyone would get, so that's why I bumped it up to four stars for this as a regular movie. The restaurant and theater scenes where well done in a classic romance movie way. Some guys may get the humor in the hallway scene with her tone of voice as she is seducing him to take the class, get a better job, and wanting to meet his family. During intimacy he doesn't even do what he says he likes and has opportunities to do. He is not a completely masculine man, not because of porn, but within himself, and he hides the truth from her that yes he did watch porn while she was there in his bed just to please her and this shows his weakness not strength (imagine if it was Thor watching porn, were you watching porn, yup, goodnight Thor). He's a wimp and let's her boss him around and take over his own apartment. Barbara wanted a fairy tale wedding, is critical of him in the gym, yells at him, Barbara talks about more money. To those who say this is a anti-porn movie watch the scene picking out the curtains, he shouldn't clean although he enjoys it, she is bossy and tells him what to do, says she is moving in, goes through his stuff, and goes crazy. He is not a Don Juan (missing the ua), if he was he would have got a maid and had a Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Esther says she is not judgmental, but she is. In the vehicle Esther criticizes his manly abilities and he puts up with it. Esther says he is addicted to porn, as she is SMOKING. Esther does not care about Jon either, with the smoke. Esther is an older woman using him, but he doesn't see that now. With an addiction to smoking Esther is smoking AGAIN. In an epic scene for this movie Jon's sister tells the truth that Barbara only wanted a guy to fulfill her own agenda, etc. There is an Inception-esq bathtub, and then Esther and Jon talk and tantra and it's as if they have this close emotional connection possibly showing how it's not about the physical. Esther already has a previous husbands house. Not watching porn for a week was not what allowed them to talk for a few minutes (maybe it was the Inception bathtub). This is not The People Vs Larry Flynt showing why porn is good for freedom. Don Jon doesn't seem to say if there's addictions to sports, tank tops, weekly church confessions, gym, fairy tales, romance movies, or letting other people control you. Other reviews are probably not going to say that only courtship for over a month could mean controlling trouble, or if neither will enthusiastically do some intimate things mentioned in the film then they are not completely into each other. Jon the character is not too swift, so there probably won't be a Don Jon 2 about Esther's pad/ride/money once she's done using Jon.",1393977600,,4094,4.481927710843373

I can go on and on but to me this movie has no heart like 500 days of summer did, he just plays a douchbag really.

I'd seen the trailers and thought the premise great, and assumed the ScarJo relationship would be defining in some way. Watching it, I first thought that the Moore character was both a ditz and superfluous.  Goes to show that I know very little.  I summarize it as a movie defining one young man's growth.  The porn scenes are tastefully handled (I'm sure parents will look at their sons' kleenex use differently), the confession scenes are hilarious (I'm a 'former' catholic) and the denouement is surprising, satisfying, and sweet (but not cloying).  There is a lot of excellent character exposition through the action (dinners at mom's, his apartment, clubbing, Sunday Mass) and it's handled better, I thought, than many longer films from high-end writers/directors.

if you are an old guy or gal, or married, or in a ""happy relationship"" or with a ""princess syndrome""
you will find this movie boring and pointless.  However, if you are still relatively ""normal"" young and single, this movie should speak ""LOUD AND CLEAR"" to you,

Also, this movie can be watched on at least two different levels, at first glance one might think nothing
too deep is happening here, yet if you watch closely or at second viewing you might catch certain things that
make this movie great...such as unfinished dialogue, and intelligently filmed quiet scenes that speak louder then words.

5827005,5,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon bravely ventures into territory few, if any, movies would dare to go. The movie explores topics such as male porn use, the complications porn use can bring into a relationship, and porn addiction. And as if thats not enough, it does it with mainstream actors including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, and Julianne Moore. Written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this comedy/romance/drama is full of meaning while also being extremely entertaining.

Without giving away too many spoilers, the movie follows the main character Jon, nicknamed Don Jon by his friends for his reputation as a ladies man. Jons life revolves around his apartment, his ride, his body, his church, his family, his friends, his ladies, and his porn. Jon finds porn to be a normal part of life and ranks it above real sex for his ability to lose himself in it. Things get tricky when Jon falls in love and enters into an actual relationship, while continuing his apparent addiction to porn. It gets complicated when he finds that his opinion of porn clashes with his girlfriends. Don Jon is funny, touching, serious, and full of dynamic character development. It does all of this while addressing topics most shy away from and are afraid to talk openly about.

As a former porn addict, I found this film extremely refreshing and Gordon-Levitts perspective on porn/porn addiction to be unique and somewhat enlightening. Honestly, it was a stepping stone for me in my overcoming porn addiction. It inspired me to do more research, dig deeper, and finally beat the addiction. Im sure it won't have that effect on everyone, but it really stuck a chord for me and for that reason, I would highly recommend it to anyone with a porn addiction who is trying to stop. Great movie!

5827211,4,B00DL477I0,"After my last review on Thor the Dark World, I kinda took a step back and told myself I needed a break. I was planning to take a break from movie watching and reviewing, but I did not plan to watch movies like You're Next, Dead Man Down, and Don Jon during this period. Nonetheless, that is exactly what ended up happening, and today I bring my review on the movie Don Jon.

Don Jon introduces us to Jon Martello(classic name huh?) and Jon is a guy who is has his own house,car, etc. He is a player, meaning he gets a lot of girls for sex, but the strange thing about our character Jon, is that although he gets plenty of girls, he watches pornography. As a matter of fact he tells us(the audience) that he prefers the porn movies. Soon Jon meets the a girl Barbara Sugarman who he believes to be the girl he has been waiting his whole life for. But  as luck would have it, he meets another lady by the name of Esther who we see as being the better girl for Jon. And so begins our movie.

I have to say that as a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt and independent films, I was excited to hear earlier last year that he would be directing a his own movie for the first time. And once I read up on the premise, I won't say I wasn't in the least bit baffled; because in all honesty I was, but I figured that Don Jon would still be a movie worth watching. And for the most part it is. We get a guy who has the good looks gets all the girls, watches porn and goes to church on Sunday. Its funny too because (SPOILER) in the film one of our main female characters compares him to a junkie. But there are some serious moments in the movie as well. If I could point out some of the highlights of the film, would be Julianne Moore's and Scarlett Johansson's performances.

Don Jon is like Spring Breakers in a sense because it has topics that we tend to avoid or are too ashamed to discuss, but I do feel that it has this charisma or confidence about it that makes it a movie worth mentioning. Because lets be honest, any other movie about a guy's addiction to porn would probably not be as worthwhile as this movie is. I won't say that after you watch this movie you are going to want to go out and buy it(which, if you do then to each his/her own), but I will say that Don Jon is a movie that gets:

5827312,4,B00DL477I0,"This movie does feature porn, though never full shots (as then it couldn't be rated R), so if that bothers you, stay away. The main character, played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt is addicted to porn, and to 'real' women too. He's a nightclub playboy with little in the way of other ambitions, who confesses his transgressions weekly at church. When he falls for Scarlet Johansson's character, he has met his match. She knows how to use sex to get him to do what she wants, and he quickly renounces his play boy ways. Their scenes together highlight all of the different sex/power games that young couples play, and it is quite entertaining (plus Scarlet is gorgeous in this.) Julianne Moore' plays an older, wiser woman (though still sexy) that helps Levitt's character begin to see he wants some deeper than either Scarlet or porn.

I am a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, and he does a decent job with the script, directing, and acting.  However I felt the Jersey persona he adapted in his role was too cliched.  It was like he just watched 2 seasons of the Jersey Shore to get into character, the same can be said for Scarlett Johansen.  Overall the message and motifs were enjoyable and it was neat to watch Jon wake up and change for the better.  Tony Danza played an entertaining supporting role as well.  A lot of the outcomes to the plot and subplots were predictable, but still enjoyable.  Each character had a sense of humanity which is nice, despite their overplayed Jerz personas.

5827376,3,B00DL477I0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and starred as 'Don Jon', about a New Jersey 'Guido' who is addicted to pornography. When we first meet 'Don Jon', he's hanging out with his pals at a bar, and has no trouble picking up women. There's a good deal of banter between the guys as they rate the women they see in the bar, on a scale of 1 to 10. Jon makes it clear that porn is still superior to having sex with real, live women.

Eventually, Jon hooks up with Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), who has a decided 'New Joisy' accent. She attempts to make a man of him by urging him to go to night school to get a more professional job and he indulges her tastes in romantic movies. Barbara keeps him on a leash for a while before they have sex but soon discovers his mean addiction to porn. Jon promises Barbara that he doesn't watch porn and brings her over to meet his over the top parents, who fall in love with her (the parents, are written as over-bearing Italian stereotypes). Finally, Barbara becomes aware that indeed Jon has been lying to her, after discovering that his browser history indicates that he frequents porn sites all the time. Barbara then promptly dumps Jon around the midpoint of the film.

Up until this point, the problem with Gordon-Levitt's screen writing is that there's too much repetition. We're constantly bombarded with near X-rated images illustrating Jon's addiction. There's also all those repetitious scenes where Jon is constantly at his local church's confession box, reporting his sexual escapades and porn excesses, to the local priest.

Finally, the story takes a more refreshing turn when Jon forms a relationship with Esther (Julianne Moore), a middle-aged widow, who lost her husband and son in a car crash a couple of years before. Esther turns Jon into a 'mensch' by impressing upon him that sex should be much more intimate, leading to a union of souls. Jon takes the bait and now 'Don Jon' has morphed into an updated 'Marty' (the 1955 drama starring Ernest Borgnine, who plays a working class stiff who grows to maturity through the love of a good woman).

Would the 'Guidos' of this world, end up opening themselves up to expanding their self-consciousness? In most real-life scenarios, unlikely. But here, after being bombarded with scenes of the boorish Jon 'doing his thing', it's a refreshing twist to have this clueless Guido, suddenly transformed into a sensitive guy, who relates to women as human beings. Many critics found 'Don Jon' to be one-dimensional in many places, which it is--but it also entertains to a good degree and features a neat shift in the protagonist's internal arc.",1391990400,,2688,4.796976241900648

I do like the story overall and I guess I like the narration, I think my only issue with the narration is the thought that maybe it meant that he was telling the story into a camera or to someone in the end. It was interesting to see the juxtaposition between the awesomeness that is porn for him and the same importance that Scarlet's character puts on RomComs. It does feel a little generic in the sense that ""all men love porn and all women love RomComs"" but it's worth a watch and doesn't feel lengthy.

5827486,5,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon tells the story of the ""battle of the sexes,"" or parrying of the genders excellently.  Boys will always be boys and most girls will always be women.  They say that women give sex to get love, and that is perfectly portrayed in this film.  Due to DNA, genes, ""hard-wiring,"" boys and men have been and will always be attracted to Adult Entertainment.  That attraction is innate to the male nature.  Even the most free thinking woman, such as ""Esther,"" who can acknowledge that a man seeks out Porn, ultimately wants her man to be on the better side of the angles and angles of human nature.  ""Esther"" puts the case as well as anyone ever has; if two people want to lose themselves in one another that is the strongest commitment that they can ever hope to make.  Don Jon covers the waterfront of male/female relationships in our time.

There are no ""good men.""  There are no white knights in shining armour saving anyone or anything by riding up on a white horse.  The era of the ""good guy"" wearing a white hat is a throwback to the ""Golden Age"" of various trends in America and the World.  Even the best men among us feel guilty just for waking up each day.

5827543,4,B00DL477I0,"The movie was put together in an interesting fashion - the complete process is excellently explained in the extras provided on the Blu-Ray disc. The actors were all quite suited to their characters. Everything should have come together into a stunning movie. My problem, however, is that an addiction to anything is caused by pleasure extracted from that causing the addiction. Yes, the hero certainly does watch the porn and seems addicted to it. But the scenes where he is ""on the computer"" are not showing any real ""pleasure."" Just momentary relief. And this takes whatever is ""sexy"" (which would lead to his addiction) in the film and really eliminates the pleasure of ""sex"" from the addiction - even to the point of making it laughable after seeing the hero simply pleasuring himself (without really showing actual pleasure) repeatedly in too many identical scenes:  it actually becomes boring - just the opposite of what a porn addiction should present.

  This is a strange comedy - as the subject is really not funny at all. And that is probably the problem with the movie. Done without the attempted comedy aspect - this movie would be a stunning and much more realistic drama - and they had the actors who could have pulled it off. So, this is a well-done semi comedy that could have been a shocking and excellent drama. I would recommend this movie to friends who are interested in motion pictures and who would like to discuss the film. It is not a ""ha, ha, ha"" comedy for adults. It makes you think, but oh, if it only really tackled the subject - - how much more you would be taken in by the film!",1391212800,,1611,4.6223776223776225

5827630,4,B00DL477I0,"I swear to god I didn't plan this, but it is oddly appropriate that the 69th film I see from the film year that is 2013 happens to be Don Jon.  I honestly couldn't have planned this out if I tried, but I do keep track and yes it is true.

Ive been excited to see this movie since I saw the first trailer.  I take that back.  It goes even further back than that.  Remember back when there were those rumors that Scarlett Johansson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were the cutest couple in Hollywood only to have those rumors merely be the start of this collaboration, which happened to be Josephs directorial debut?  Yeah, Ive been excited to see the two of them together on the big screen since then.  Sadly, my life doesnt always accommodate my every cinematic desire, and convincing my wife to see a movie starring Scarlett Johansson (who she hates for her good looks and my shameless obsession with) about porn addiction was not going to be an easy sell, so it had to wait.

Honestly, watching this this afternoon while my wife was out felt a lot like sneaking porn, not because Don Jon is overly pornographic in nature but because I knew shed be upset if she found out about it.

I other words, it would have went down similar to when Barbara checked Jons browsing history.

Don Jon didn't meet with a lot of criticism.  It met with some, and I read into it, but overall it was considered a pretty impressive directorial debut.  Watching Don Jon I found myself finding it more than merely impressive, at least for a while.  In fact, my huge hitch with Don Jon is that it feels like two separate films, and so in the end it suffers from an identity crisis of sorts.  I obviously blame Gordon-Levitts inexperience for this, but at the end of the day his tenacity and obvious knack for storytelling and cinematic framing should not be overlooked.  The first half of the film plays out like a French New Wave inspired episode of Jersey Shore, and I mean that in complete and total gleeful excitement.  The slow motion exagerations, the stereotypical clichs dripping from every frame and Scarlett Johanssons gum smacking perfection; all these elements felt so beautifully inspired and complete.

I was in love.

In fact, the only other film this year to make me smile as much as this one was Enough Said, and we all know how perfect I think that film is.  Yes, for the majority of this film, even the scenes that I didn't think fit the mold the way they should have, I was smiling ear to ear.  Its just a fun, flirty and happy film.  Its like the comedic version of Shame, which I know sounds really odd and yet it kind of works.  Even Gordon-Levitts seeming directorial quirks (many griped about the films repetitious sequences) work in the context of the film, and the way that he explores quite a few themes (from addiction to religion to relationships) without every once getting heavy handed is rather remarkable.  While it does resort to telling Jon the problem he already knows he has, I do like the way that the first half of Don Jon nonchalantly outlines the core of Jons problem, that porn allows him to completely let go without having to engage anyone else.  The countless one night stands mean nothing and so he cant connect, but the mindless porn, while meaning absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things, mean more because he can get whatever he wants out of it.

But with all this praise comes a bit of negative energy as well.  There were two characters that I just couldn't support because they made Josephs otherwise effortless and easy film feel contrived and reaching.  First, Monica, Jons silent sister.  I called it from the first scene that she was going to be that one character who says nothing until the very end, where she spits out some words of wisdom brought on by her silent observations.  Yes, she was right (and thankfully up until she said it, the film was very subtle in the buildup) but it felt unnecessary.  Even more distasteful for me was the character of Esther, the cougar/advice dispenser who befriends Jon about halfway through and serves and the catalyst of change for his character.  It just felt like a very clichd way to go, and while Don Jon as a whole is a film that is built on clichs (from the Guido mentality to the Italian family), this particular clich took itself too seriously.

And her backstory just felt completely out of place.

Still, Don Jon is a blast and shows a lot of promise for the young director.  It also sports a hilariously pitch perfect ensemble.  Gordon-Levitt carries the film with deepened vocals and a swag that cant be manufactured, and his entire crazy family (from Larson to Danza to a hilarious Glenne Headly) makes every scene a delight.  But the film does belong to Scarlett Johansson, who has never been funnier.  She never breaks character and delivers a delicious portrayal of a man-eater, and she just gets it.  Think Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny for the MTV crowd.  She spits the banter like a pro, and her line readings are honestly my favorite from anyone Ive seen so far this year.

5827631,4,B00DL477I0,"Josepth Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed, and starred in this film. There are a lot of bad reviews, obviously some people didn't get it. My wife and I both liked it and thought it was funny at times while handling an important topic in a smart way. Yes the main character is addicted to porn and completely shallow, but the story is deeper than that. This guy rates everything by a number, sex, women, even how many prayers he has to say after confessing to his sins. It's a story about a young man maturing and realizing that there's a difference between meaningless sex and true intimacy. The story is much deeper than some people realize. Because of comic book movies or violent action flicks, or stupid brain-dead one joke comedies, many people just don't understand a movie that actually makes you think about life and relationships. The main character, Don Jon, finds his own soul through the heart of an older woman. Not everyone will like it, but it's a good movie. The movie is rated 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.

My initial thoughts were it seemed like it would be like a somewhat comedic take on the Jersey Shore meets The Notebook. Could be interesting right? at least  could be 5bucks worth, right? WRONG!

I have no idea how anyone finds any form of ""depth"" to this trash. It was complete garbage start to finish, do not waste your time, the movie was awful.

Here it is: good looking guy addicted to porn, finds a hot girl, cant stop watching porn, they break up, he still watches porn, weird older woman enters, they ""connect"", he stops watching porn, the end.

That whole thing sounds misogynistic and gross. And yeah, in the beginning of the movie, Jon is misogynistic and gross and I was cringing a lot.

But this isn't a movie about porn. It's a movie about a certain type of guy who thinks he is looking for a certain type of girl, and when he finds the one he thinks is perfect, he sees that life isn't like the movies and sex isn't like porn, and it shouldn't be!

The best thing about this film, though, is that Joseph Gordon Levitt, in his other roles and in his hitRECord project, seems like such a nice guy. He seems, in real life, to be very respectful and kind.

Yes, internet porn is a common subject discussed in the movie and it makes a lot of sense - if you look it up, stats show that more people watch online porn than netflix, amazon and twitter combined. It was about time that a character in a movie nowadays shows some level of addiction to it, but I digress. The message and story in this movie is more than that of addiction.

Being in my mid-twenties, I wish this was a mandated watch for all males! It very clearly addresses the superficiality of looks and how that doesn't quite get you far. I wish JGL had developed Barbera's character a little more--background into why she acted the way she did would've improved the movie.

Did he have a girlfriend who forbid pornography?  What is his point in the end?  He seems lukewarm about the one relationship where he supposedly learns to connect with a real live woman.

5828378,4,B00DL477I0,"At first blush, the flick didn't look promising. ""Don Jon"" is set in NJ and is populated by characters too classless for ""Jersey Shore."" Yet, Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has enough heart underneath his crassness for us soon to start to care what happens to him - barely enough, but enough. (Spoilers follow.)

On the surface, the film is about one man's porn addiction, but the target is really bigger: it is about modern narcissism of which Jon's pastime is a symptom. Jon prefers internet porn to real women. He likes real women, to be sure, and is an expert seducer of them: hence the nickname ""Don Jon"" given to him by his friends. He and his pals enjoy cruising sleazy pick-up clubs, and Jon rarely leaves without an 8, 9 or ""dime"" on his 1-to-10 scale. Nevertheless, the flesh-and-blood dates don't ever measure up in his mind to his private sessions in front of his computer screen; in fact, he commonly retreats to his computer after his companion for the evening falls asleep. The advantage to porn sex is that it is all about him. He need bring nothing to the relationship. There is no relationship; his indulgence is entirely one-sided.

Jon meets a dime named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). Jon's father (Tony Danza) leers his approval when he brings her home to meet the family, and compliments Jon on the ""piece of ass."" His sister Monica (Brie Larson) just rolls her eyes while remaining silently glued to her smart phone. Though Jon falls hard for Barbara, even she doesn't equal his porn sessions, so he continues with them. Early on, Barbara catches Jon looking at porn and makes him promise to give it up; Jon doesn't give it up, but is careful to keep his habit out of her sight.

Barbara is addicted to her own brand of film fantasies: romantic comedies. Exiting a theater, she gushes to Jon about how romantic the movie was: ""He gave up everything for her,"" she says. Her response to the movie is telling, for it expresses exactly what she wants for herself. In truth, the only thing Barbara brings to her relationship with Jon is sex; otherwise she is entirely one-sided. Everything is about her, and she is highly demanding of Jon in ways large and small. Perhaps this is why she feels so threatened by porn: she senses it is a true rival to her only asset.

Barbara snoops on Jon's browser history and is appalled to discover he still visits porn sites - a lot. Barbara accordingly breaks up with him. When Jon reveals the break-up to his family, his parents act as if he has harmed them personally. His mother wails that she wants grandchildren. Monica, though, unexpectedly looks up from her phone and with perfect accuracy tells Jon (her only lines in the whole movie) that he is better off because Barbara just wanted someone to boss around.

(This minimalist use of Brie Larson is contrary to expectation precisely because she is capable of so much more - she is a good actress and her vocals for ""Black Sheep"" in ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" were better than the original, and I like Metric.)

By luck, Jon finally does get a taste of what a real two-way affair is like, thanks to an older, wiser, and open-minded woman named Esther (Julianne Moore). The experience gives him some personal insight about his own shortcomings and motivations.",1389657600,2,3263,4.666086956521739

5828426,2,B00DL477I0,"I watched this movie because I thought it was going to be a radical ""changing of heart"" story. Well, the movie was on the lowest end of this idea.

I don't know what Joseph Gordon-Levitt's true intentions were with this movie but I hope it was on the side of learning of WHAT NOT TO DO. Also how many of us typically act. Watch this movie with a careful eye and you can learn a lot. What came to my mind when I saw how neat and clean the kid was, yet rotten on the inside was. Matthew 23:26 ""...First clean the inside of the cup and dish and then also the outside will be clean."" You literally see this verse in action in a scene where Jon tries to scrub away every bit of grime from his plate as he washes the dishes, and yet loves porn!

I hope the Catholics are not too offended at this movie (well maybe the Italian catholics). But again there is a bit of truth in how the movie depicts this tradition of sin, confession, don't learn anything ... sin, confession, don't learn anything...

As for entertainment purposes, this movie stinks. There are a few funny parts, but over all too much graphic porn (even though there was not much graphic nudity in the ""real"" sex scenes).

5828429,4,B00DL477I0,"All mixed reviews aside, this movie is probably the most realistic romantic comedy I've ever seen.  The film covers the initial ups and the eventual downs of a relationship.  Although the film does have some generalizations, it's realism eventually shines through.  I've met and dated women like most of the film's female characters. I have yet to meet a Rose from Titanic, but I've met a surprising amount of Barbara Sugarman's. The film debunks romantic comedies and gets inside the psyche of most men born in the 1980s.

I think the film is meant to explore the romantic mindset of modern young people.  It's mixed reviews come from people who fail to comprehend the film's message.  Which is that  men often watch too much porn, and women watch too many romantic comedies.  We develop unrealistic expectations of the opposite sex, and we're often disappointed when reality falls short of fantasy.",1389571200,2,900,4.953333333333333
5828430,5,B00DL477I0,"I have to admit I kind of loved this film.
At first i thought oh here we go a straight up man's flick about masturbation,which still wouldn't be that bad seeing as Joseph Gordon Levitt has blossomed into such a hot stud.

Scarlett Johansson was  good as the ever so stereotypical New Jersey bimbo but still got on my nerves, they could have toned down her (New Joisey) dialect a bit but I suppose they wanted the Fargo- esque thing, which worked to  Fargo's advantage much more so than to Don Jon's in my opinion .

Ever so slowly we are introduced to Julianne Moore's mysterious character ""Esther"" who was amazingly subdued  yet heart tugging and I knew that there was a greater purpose for her in the film than to serve as Don Jon's annoying verbal punching bag. I had heard nothing  about this film  so was I was pleased to get to see it untarnished.

Ok i'm a woman so I was highly touched by the relationship that built between Esther and Don Jon.  The first time they 'Made Love' on the sofa  after  she revealed  her demons to Jon  their  faces  were so intense and the scene was so beautiful I could almost feel him  making love to me.

There are so many lessons learned in this film disguised as a ""sex romp comedy"".

5828486,1,B00DL477I0,"From the preview, I got the idea that this movie was a love story...and while I knew the main character (levitt) suffered from porn addiction, I did not consider that his issue would be depicted so graphically. The story line didn't make sense and it was weird when he started having sexual relations with a woman that looked older than his mother.

Don Jon (levitt) when I think about it was a low life loser. At best, he had a mediocre existence, and even at the end of the movie, he was just as lack-luster as he began. I fail to see the real message, plot and point of this movie. I do not recommend this to anyone. My father-in-law, a God-fearing man was planning to see ""this love story"" with his wife...I immediately cautioned him.

5828626,4,B00DL477I0,"I wasn't sure about this film but found the premise interesting. Although ambivalent about the ending, I found the comparative approach to illustrating how pornography and romance films both (albeit in very distinct ways) harbor the potential to distort relationship expectations compelling. The film does a much better job addressing the allure and function of pornography in the male character's life than it does fleshing out how romance films affect the female lead. This asymmetry has to do with the narration coming from within the male character and his perspective though; so the viewer only observes the external actions of the female character. As one might expect then, the female lead appears less complex than the male lead, but the ""female experience"" is expanded through the supporting female character. In addition, it might be noted that although consumption of pornography is mapped to the white US American male body, its desires, and its gender formation, and romance films to the white US American female body, its desires, and its gender formation, this stereotypical dichotomy and gendered understanding must be considered as an imposed frame. A more cynical attitude might write this film off as reinforcing a constellation of sexist ideologies, which it does in some ways no matter how generous an attitude one tries to hold. Still, the film includes some very insightful and interesting ways of thinking about how pornography functions in the imaginaries.",1389398400,,1481,5.306382978723405

Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man addicted to porn,but he finds a woman who is a ""perfect 10"", Scarlett Johansson, who has bought into romance movies' portrayal of the perfect man and the perfect life. Neither character finds full satisfaction in the other, and Jon finds himself wondering what's wrong

I must say, it handled the subject matter in a frank and humorous way, and gives an honest perspective on a man's thoughts on sex, pornography, and the challenges that come from a culture that bombards men and women alike with ideas that are total fantasy. It's refreshing to see a film that is still essentially about people falling in love talk about pushing those fantasies aside and attempting to make a meaningful connection to another human being. While I wouldn't say that my personal values line up completely with those of the film, I don't really see anyone else tackling this subject that I think is becoming a problem for many young people. Like anyone good story, there's plenty to think about and self-examine after the credits roll.",1389139200,,1267,4.8341013824884795

5828861,3,B00DL477I0,"I must admit that when I saw this in the theater I almost walked out after the first 15 minutes.  In fact I saw 2 women walking out of the theater just as I had been thinking to do so for several minutes.  Something told me I should stay a little longer though since I know Julliane Moore would not choose to do a film she did not believe in and her talent and roster of amazing films speak for themselves.  I was very glad I stayed.

The problem is that I didn't know what to expect.  I saw this movie only because it happened to be playing at the right time when I went to the theater that day.  So I took a chance.  The first 15 minutes seemed to be nothing but hard core pornography and cussing.  It seemed like a movie that wasn't planning to do anything other than shock us just for the sake of it.  However this turns out to be wrong.  Don Jon is about how both men and women in our current media obsessed world come up with impossible fantasies which ultimately destroy their relationships.  Women dream of that perfect romantic, sophisticated, handsome man that sacrifices himself for her in the romantic movie genre while men fantasize about perfectly shaped T&A nymphomaniacs that never age over the age of 24.  Both ideas are ridiculously unrealistic and yet holding on to these ideas of perfection portrayed in the media is why so many relationships and marriages today fail.  As couples who have been married for several decades often say- 'The problem with young people in marriage today is that their expectations are too high and this sets them up for misery and failure.  In our day our expectations in relationships were much more down to earth.'  Don Jon meets the mirror twin of himself when he meets who he thinks is the woman of his dreams.  She, like he- is manipulative when it comes to the opposite sex.  She, like he is looking to fulfill an unrealistic fantasy.  She, like he- cannot be fulfilled in the relationship because it does not match the fantasy of what she thinks things should be like.  As the movie progresses we watch Don emerge from this trap into a more evolved person as he learns to accept the person who he is with and really be with THEM and not a fantasy... while his previous mirror image stays behind repeating her mistakes.  Don Jon's family is also interesting in all this as his desire to please his parents influences what he thinks he wants and later we watch him grow from this as well.  We see Don eventually romance in an unexpected place and experiences it in a way the media never shows.  A good movie over-all.",1389139200,,2571,4.437100213219616

The main character and his family are sitting at dinner and in the background is one of those commercials with a sexy, scantily clad model eating a hamburger with pornographic relish... the tableau of family life including mother and sister juxtaposed with this image... add to that the pornography addiction of the main character... this scene portrays the entire message of the film as well as so much that is toxic about the current media culture. The disappointment of this film is that the story is told with characters we don't like and don't care about. While Jon has some likeable qualities, as do his family, friends and even Julianne Moore's character, they aren't portrayed sympathetically enough for us to have much interest in their problems.

But it follows Jon's journey through learning how to be fulfilled in life, especially in the context of sex. Warning: there is a lot of porn in this movie, so be careful where you watch it! The story was surprisingly endearing and the acting made me think I was intruding on family drama, inside jokes, and truly intimate moments. Overall, I would recommend this movie for anyone who is in the mood for a movie where you can laugh at the idiocy and hypocrisy of sex and dating, while experiencing a redemptive twist at the end.",1389052800,4,725,4.417910447761194

It had it's why did he do that, what happened with that moments, like when Scarlett's character Barbara tells her girlfriends that he's in school then all of the sudden he's going to class and what was up with his sister she never said anything she was always looking at her phone then finally speaks up once to tell Joseph's character Jon  that Barbara didn't really want him.

As a comedy it does have its laughs. Really though its a love story at heart. Which is not what is shown in the trailers. I think the direction of the movie is well done.

His addiction was making his real life relatonships suffer and he was getting a false view of what ""making love"" can be.  In the end lets just say he finds someone who helps change his mind.

Somehow, the trailer makes you believe this is a funny movie with personality and laughs-  this is a complete distortion from the truth.  The movie was worse than horrible.  Besides the storyline being terrible.. the voices/accents are atrocious.  I live in Brooklyn and hear accents like this daily but this movie made me think this accent sounds ridiculous.

We joked midway through watching him dry-hump Scarlett Johansson for 2 minutes in a hallway that Joseph Gordon-Levitt must have written and directed the movie himself. We got a pretty good laugh once the credits rolled. The whole movie seems to be made ironically, with every New Jersey stereotype making it's dutiful appearance.

It was an interesting take on relationships - how men view pornography and how women romanticize the ""happily ever after"" they see in movies. I have seen about 90% all of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's films.  I think he is one of the best young actors out there and his choice of film projects never disappoints.

In my opinion, the film takes an authentic look at relationships and unreal expectations, and also reveals the emptiness of seeking fulfillment based on image alone. I LOVED it and think it may be for a more mature audience who has gone through the emptiness of running after the perfect body and perfect looks for love rather than the pursuit of love itself or the enjoyment of just being with another human, regardless of the shell. It's about human connection. Well done, without being overdone.",1388880000,,663,4.773913043478261

  Joseph, made a great impression upon me, a few draw backs of the film, it's to fundamentally like watching an 80's flash back in the clothing style and slight portrayal of the lead characters at times, in Joesph and Tony Danza
The positives, Levitt knows what he's doing, the movie is not as one reviewer stated, it's not about ejaculation, or mindless slap stick humor, he wrote an actual deep story that's fundamentally true to and for most males in how they not only perceive their self but how they interrelate with the female
Major positive, Julianne Moore, her character is similar to boogie nights and I swear she is so feminine and encaptures your attention, she's beautiful in this film, that's not overly sexual, it's fundamentally a look at your self learning experience for the vast majority who view the film, in that it's a take on what love and intimacy actually are. If your a fan of Moore or Levitt, you will love this movie,
Scarlett, shines as well, not forgetting about her just Moore, captured my undivided attention in boogie nights and seemingly is the basis of intimacy at least on film, from the female aspect,
It's Levitt's first I believe attempt at directing a major film, and not many get a second attempt, I believe he will
It's not mindless film recorded to bore one or obtain one's money by placing actors with names together, it's a film with actual unnoticeable direction and a path, with an actual statement,
Love is free and unconditional, it knows no color form or sex, and when one can experience and express this with another it's worth discovering internally

What is more realistic is him discovering that older women are more likely to do the things he sees in porn movies and the whole widow thing, with the  dead husband and child,  right before sex on the couch is another non-starter.
The lesson of choosing substance over fantasy could have been conveyed with better casting for a new love interest and a third selection, more fitting for this guy,  maybe a mature woman, a few years older comes along after he gets done with a  non-widowed version  of Moore's character that loves to be a freak in the bedroom....

5829635,5,B00DL477I0,"First, this movie is misunderstood as a document of sex culture in 21st century America. Folks reviewing the movie are just as scandalized by Joseph Gordon-Levitt throwing tissues in a wastebasket as they are by the brief clips of porn his character watches. ""Don Jon"" is, at the very least, a portrayal of the internal monologue of a porn consumer, an up-close and intimate encounter with someone who uses porn as a sexual outlet. People are uncomfortable seeing the protagonist's emotional hangups, sexual biases, and immature misunderstandings in romance, and they take their discomfort as a sign that the movie is flawed. I think

Second, this movie is vastly misunderstood as a piece of cinema. It's not a sweeping, Oscar-bait epic, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's very clever in being cartoonish and funny in some ways but all too real in other ways. Furthermore, Joseph Gordon-Levitt conducts every shot as meticulously as the character Jon conducts his daily rituals. The acting is superb. The movie is totally alive. Even though the plot is simple, I couldn't stop watching. I cared about the characters' every move. There's nothing wrong with a simple plot, especially when everything else about the movie--the commentary about sex in today's America, the actors' performances and chemistry, the well-framed shots and smart location choices--is so solid.

5829672,2,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a bar tender who works out. He beds lots of pretty girls and loves his porn...a lot. He meets Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) who is a ten (a dime) and he must have her. She makes him court her first, going to chick flicks. Barbara objects to porn, so Don must hide his addiction. Don also meets and older woman (Julianne Moore) who understands his porn addiction and is not judgmental.

The plot doesn't have any real surprises or twists. My question about the film is what was the message? Relationships are important? Old fashion porn is healthy because it has relationships where modern porn does not? A guy will give up his porn on his own if he really into the relationship? i.e if your man watches porn, you're an inadequate woman or he is messed up. Or a deep Julianne Moore trumps a shallow Scarlett Johansson with a Jersey accent?

The film follows a standard formula, except it includes porn. I never really cared for the characters. The acting was fine, but the film didn't grab me. Perhaps it was because there were simply too many scenes of Don throwing tissues into a waste basket.

Yes, the subject of porn as the basis for a plot is disturbing but it is a part of our culture. After a few minutes I was so engrossed in the movie that the porn was there but it was the storyline and terrific performance's that kept me engrossed and watching.
Kudos to Levitt for writing, directing, and starring in this offbeat comedy. The casting is perfect. I am not going to give a synopsis of the movie and spoil it for potential viewers. Tony Danza and Levitt are so alike its easy to believe they are father and son. Scarlet Johansson with a brooklynese accent is perfect as the girl friend who uses sex to try and get Jon to do her bidding. Julianne Moore is once again outstanding as an older woman who enters Jon's life at a time they both needed each other. The ending was a surprise but it made sense for the characters development at this point in their lives. I can't wait to watch it again.

This, possibly, is due to the fact that the humor is based on *softly* parodying (or maybe it's more tongue-in-cheek?) social, religious, ethnic,  generational, and regional norms, while making the parody of such seem completely believable and an expected reaction/motivation from the character's perspective.

In sum, a thoroughly enjoyable cautionary tale for both women and men with regard to their possibly unrealistic expectations for potential mates, and how the preconceptions about romance, sex, and the natural arc of a potential love relationship can be a thing that can be used, unintentionally, or intentionally, to maintain an emotional distance.",1388448000,,823,5.47244094488189

I think it's also really interesting to consider the way that Jon talks about the two different women in the film--one of them he refers to as ""the most beautiful thing"" while the other woman becomes an actual woman for him, not a thing.

The plot if this movie contains a powerful but subtly inlaid message that if you aren't clever or haven't already already noticed in authentic life that you aren't going to get.  The acting, bashed by others, is a very clever portrayal of a cultural phenomenon that is growing--immersion in things without commitment--immersion in church, in culture, immersion in sex, immersion in pornography, immersion in movies/fairy tales, immersion in sexuality.  Immersion in sports, immersion in electronics.  But no commitment, no passion, no zest, no feeling.  Lack of authentic connection.  And spoiler alert:  I know we all want the hot girl to win...because she's hot..and because it would make fairy tales come true.  But the reality is that if we search for those things, we miss out on the unlikely connections we could be making in the mean time.  While it's not ""sexy"" to watch our handsome lead have sexual relations with an older woman when we can watch him with someone like Barbara (Johannsen), that actuality IS the point.  Life isn't neat.  Dimes don't have to have perfect bodies.  Its about connection and our culture of inundation without authentication forces us to believe that Johannsen IS the be all--to the detriment of authentic people and authentic relationships, and authentic connection.",1388275200,15,1458,5.17948717948718

To add, Scarlett did a fantastic job and has come off age, I'm very happy they casted her in this film, that girl has got something, ask anyone. And Joseph Gordon? What do I tell you about this guy that you don't already know. DON JON is a kind of antithesis like take on 500 DAYS OF SUMMER. I liked the humor build up, the unpredictability, the sets used and the minimalist style of the screenplay which made sure there is plenty of room for improvement. It is a cool indie film that stands a little taller than others because it has something to offer which not many films do. I would not change anything about the film and I wouldn't give it 5 stars because it simply doesnt demand that extra star, the film doesnt care.

Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame. Overall, a very well done and good movie that won't be given a chance by many people because of the subject. I give it a B+.",1388188800,2,1313,4.015267175572519

Unfortunately, the characters are so immature that you don't ever really care about them. Don is a womanizing bartender who finally decides to try a real relationship. Except the girl he picks is a good-looking airhead. He goes to night school to impress her and that's about the extent of his ambition.

The New Jersey accents are horrible and the resolution in the end is incredibly obvious.

Great writing comes from experience. This script comes from high school. After seeing this movie all I could think is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has nothing to say. He took on a subject that could have been interesting and instead made a childish film.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt was perfect  in the role, capturing  the essence of the Jersey boy ( think Jersey Shore TV show ) and his particular macho cultural world view, especially of women.

We watch as that view slowly changes, through his 'accidental' involvement with a very different woman.  Through this inadvertent relationship with her,  he finds his true center and gains  a new, more meaningful  prespective  on love and life.

In directing the movie, Gordon-Levitt utilized  some interesting cinematic mechanisms to illustrate a point thru artistic repetition of some scenes, yet I never found it boring.

JGL's character I found highly unlikeable--and it had nothing to do with the fact that he was a porn addict. I just found him to be callous and judgmental and kind of a dick to his friends.

5830063,4,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon presents a surprisingly adult perspective on relationships.  First time writer, director, and star Joseph Gordon-Levitt said he came up with the idea for Don Jon during the filming of a film called 50/50 with Seth Rogan.  In that film, Rogan (who wrote and starred in 50/50) tries to help his friend, played by Gordon-Levitt, through the drama of his recent Cancer diagnosis by coaxing him to lose himself in meaningless sex and to use his Cancer as a sympathy device with women.  Gordon-Levitts character Jon in Don Jon feels like a combination of those two characters, which is quite fascinating.

Don Jon, in essence, is a modern retelling of the classic Don Juan legends.  Here, Jon (Gordon-Levitt) is a slick, confident ladies man  handsome, confident, and consumed with his appearance and the appearance of those with whom he desires intimacy.  As we get to know Jon, we are immersed in his chauvinism and addictive personality.  He hits the gym for his patterned out workout, he hits the church for his prepared confessions, and he hits the Internet for his regular masturbatory sessions.  He also hits the clubs nightly with his friends where they rate women on their appearance, hoping for the elusive dime or perfect 10.  That dime appears in the form of Barbara (Scarlett Johansson).  From the moment Jon and Barbara begin their romance, Don Jon stops being a character piece and starts being an intriguing look at adult relationships and how the opposite sexes view each other.  In most retellings of Don Juan legends, the protagonists sinful ways are dealt with very one-dimensionally in that he is punished for taking advantage of those around him.  Gordon-Levitt tries something different.  He tells a far more relatable story about how both men and women are guilty of attaching unreal expectations on each other due to stereotypes perpetuated by a society that profits on obsession; for men its the porn industry and for women its the fairy-tale romantic stories in the movies.

As Jon and Barbaras relationship continues, Jons addiction with porn complicates things because Jon values the virtual more than the physical.  Meanwhile, Barbaras addiction to romantic love stories puts unreal expectations on how Jon is supposed to live his life if hes going to be with her.  All of this is explored with a careful eye by Gordon-Levitt, the director.  The culmination of which is his subtle introduction of Esther (Julianne Moore) as an older classmate in Jons night school course.  Gordon-Levitt did wonders for his film by including Moore, and it is apparent from the moment she appears.  His most impressive camera work, acting, and staging occurs in this act, and it all strengthens the film as a whole.

Gordon-Levitt has made a fine exploration of one sub-section of modern adult relationships.  While some scenes seem a bit forced in terms of situation and/or dialogue (i.e. the curtain rod scene between Jon and Barbara), most of what he does works very well.  Gordon-Levitt also brilliantly casts Tony Danza in a small part as his characters father and gets an excellent little performance out of him.  It may not be time for Academy Award winning filmmaker, Joseph Gordon-Levitt just yet, but he does show promise behind the camera apart from in front of it.  B+

Don Jon is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Its a good looking, well acted look at some modern aspects of adult relationships.",1387756800,4,3447,4.918685121107266
5830064,5,B00DL477I0,"I have always enjoyed the work of JGL. This movie in particular is a social commentary about how porn has become a part of our culture and has change the way we view people, ourselves, and what we consider to be the appropriate benchmarks of healthy relationships. As a woman watching this film, I was shocked at how much I could relate. I loved the brokenness of all of the characters. It tapped into how beautifully flawed and complex we are as individuals, and the ability to seek to know oneself and to be known is a driving force of human nature that in part, the porn culture we consume is stripping away. I loved that there is not happy ending- no pun intended. It is still messy, yet there is more clarity- more truth for each of the characters. It has been a long time since I have seen a film that is not a documentary, put into words what I was feeling but didn't know how to say. Thank you to JGL. It is worth it. Rent it. I bought it, because it is something I want to make sure if I ever have kids that it is something they see.",1387670400,8,1042,4.137931034482759
5830065,2,B00DL477I0,"To start this movie has alot of pornographic images, and should be watched by adults only. I am suprised that Don did not recieve an NC-17 Rating.  If your a parent, keep the kiddies away from this one.

It's about relationships and Dons's attempt to justify his decaying moral fiber. The movie ends up feeling about as meaningless as one of Don Jon's one night stands.... I am a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but I really feel let down by him as a director/ writer.

You might get more enjoyment watching a low rate, sleazy porn movie. The trailer is far better than the actual movie. The bulk of the movie is really just a depressing look into the life of a porn addicted man.  Our protagonist doesn't develop any meaningful or healthy relationships whatsoever thoughout the entire movie.  And that would be okay with me, if Don Jon was enjoyable and fun to watch, but its NOT! He says he loves his family yet 80% of the screen time they do nothing but fight. Most of Jon and Barbara's relationship is built around manipulation. Barbara is constantly dangling promises of sex to motivate Jon, and only likes him when he does exactly what she says.  Jon decides to lie to her throughout their entire relationship.  Julianne Moore's character is amazing, but she does not offer enough to overlook Don Jon's many flaws.

The Movie Is very well acted, I can say that much, and it does offer a fresh take on typical Chick Flick or RomCom movies, but Don Jon's journey is a predictable, cliche, disapointment--with uneven storytelling to boot! A movie with this much sex should not be a turn-off.",1387670400,3,1591,4.617021276595745

5830068,5,B00DL477I0,"It's about discovering the things that are really important in life in general, and the things that are specifically important to you, and learning how to be honest about that and live your life according to that.

Many people live their lives on a trajectory that was set in motion by parents or society or by their own anxieties and miss the things that could make them truly happy and/or fulfilled.

In the story, the porn could have been replaced by gambling, working too much, trying to gain the admiration of a particular social group or family members, or anything else that distracts someone from the valuation of and participation in the really important things in life - the things that people who have lost loved ones know painfully well.

But, the masterful way Joseph and the other actors depicted Don Jon's addiction to porn, and the customs, philosophies, style and intricacies of the characters and setting gave the movie and the message life and power for the message to affect us. The casting and acting was flawless. The timing and emphasis was perfect.

It reminds me a little bit of Saturday Night Fever, which was also a more important movie than it seemed at first glance. Don Jon was a big surprise to me - it was a movie that I didn't anticipate I would greatly respect.

5830069,5,B00DL477I0,"This movie was TOO good.  I found it disturbing and difficult to watch.  I'm not from New Jersey, but I live in New Jersey.  This film IS New Jersey.  It depicted the stupid unmoral majority of undereducated, simple-minded, neanderthal, provincial inhabitants that make up about 80% of the born-and-bred residents of the State.  To - a - tee.  The other 20% only get one representative in the film, Julianne Moore.  Her character has to be a transplant from Connecticut or even California.  This actually brings another layer to the story that I'm not even sure was intentional.  Because it isn't just about her teaching him about selfish/selfless.  She has more substance than anyone else in the film.  But the idea of bettering Jon's mind and world doesn't really get addressed, just his emotional love life.

I'm not sure if the scenes with the family had any intended humor, but to me they were a scary reality of what I see around me in this part of the country daily.  Made me rather sick to my stomach and supports the idea that Americans aren't advancing, but just get dumber and more shallow all the time.

I have to give it 5 stars just because I felt it was well done, excellently acted and directed, but again, disturbing.  But disturbing is good.  It makes you think.",1387411200,2,1280,4.647321428571429
5830109,4,B00DL477I0,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt keeps testing his boundaries as an artist and that is to be applauded. The strength of his performances in the past few films grows steadily and now he branches out in to writing, directing, and starring in a film that is truly his own. Is it a great film? No, but it is an inventive one  - and that is a breath of fresh air in the current Marvel Comics shoot-`em-bang-bang-explode obsession. The fact that it deals with the current focus on sex-rated themes may be off putting to many, but that the theme is solely that speaks loudly for a young writer/director to register a parody of our current shaky quasi-relationship fad.

There is not a lot of story so the more brief the synopsis the better: A New Jersey guy, Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Though he has many sexual liaisons those episodes do not fully satisfy him the way onanism in front of a porn video does. He hits on a tacky, gum-chewing, perfect 10 Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) but that continued dance has its problems. Finally he meets a very strange older woman Esther (Julianne Moore) who puts a bit of meaning into sexual expression and Jon's life changes - maybe.

Gordon-Levitt manages to pull together a fine cast (Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke as his buddies, et al) and keeps the flavor of the accents and the characters very New Jersey. His writing for Jon's weekly confessions in church is hilarious and in general the dialogue is snappy. Gordon-Levitt spent as much time at the gym as he did creating this film and his very buff body is a showpiece! Everyone who sees this film should realize it deserves an R leaning toward X rating, but then most programs on television do these days, so everyone is used to the porn glut. Nice to see an actor take risks like this. Grady Harp, December 13",1387324800,50,2017,4.692090395480226
5830110,5,B00DL477I0,"Excellent directorial debut by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. That cute kid from Third Rock From The Sun has turned into quite the filmmaker.  Don Jon is an excellent story that challenges it's viewers to look a little more closely into the nature of addiction, cultural programming through sappy RomComs, and the problem with looking to a religious rite or ritual to save you from the consequences of your actions.  Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young man drifting unconsciously through his life.  He escapes though porn, treats women as conquests, perpetually drives with road rage, and wipes the slate clean each week by confessing to a priest.  As with anyone who drifts through life without any attempt at self-observation he continually repeats this cycle, like a karmic skipping record, until it's interrupted by a simple question, ""Can you stop?""  Not only does the film address the classic egocentric alpha male archetype that objectifies women (we've seen that plenty), but through Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) it also criticizes the delusional romanticism of women programmed from the ""I wanna be a princess"" culture and it's destructive knight in shining armor / I need a man to save me and live happily ever after syndrome.  It clearly shows both of these traits and how they impede one's ability to truly and intimately connect with another human being. This film has everything: boobs for the dudes and a happy ending for the chicks.  Kidding.  Seriously, though, it's a great movie.  Watch it.",1387238400,5,1520,5.146341463414634

Personally, Ive reached a point in my life where very little genuinely surprises me when I go to the movies. Sure, an actor may give an amazing performance, but the content of todays films has become repetitious, predictable, and even a little dull. Now thats not to say there aren't good movies being made, I just feel like theres very little out there that actually goes against the grain and explores new territory. This is what ultimately makes Don Jon so enjoyable. Not only does it take these risks, but it does so with a great deal of confidence so you're never left feeling uncomfortable.

As one would guess, we follow the titular Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a womanizing porn addict who cares more about his looks than he does about settling down. After a night out with his boys Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke), Jon meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). Though she may have shut him down initially, Barbra eventually gives in due to Jons persistence. What Jon doesnt know, however, is that Barbara is nothing more than a controlling seductress. Sure, she may be a dime, but shes going to mock his quirky personality and attempt to change everything about him. In the end, this leaves Jon on a journey of self-discovery and self-worth.

Don Jon is a special film in more ways than one, but it's the way it opened the door to the psychology of both sexes that really caught my attention. On one hand, the media showers men with images and videos of the perfect woman. Women who have had more than a few alterations to their bodies, and who have been digitally modified to eliminate their physical flaws. On the other hand, women are suffocated with romantic films that exemplify the perfect man. Men who have toned bodies, perform manly activities, and give in to a womans every command. It pokes fun at these societal issues, but its also deadly serious about the message.

What surprised me most about Don Jon was its sense of character development. At the beginning of the film the audience sees Jon as this immature, emotionally blind individual. However, as you progress through the narrative, we see him grow both intellectually and emotionally. Hes more appreciative of the little things in life, and he no longer views the world through this self-created tunnel vision. He may be free to do what he wants with his life, but why should he waste it doing things that leave him unfulfilled? Though he never actually comes out and says this, you can still see it, and thats just a testament to Gordon-Levitts talent as both an actor and a writer.

Unfortunately, as a result of this character development, theres a strange tonal shift within the final act of the movie. Everything up to that point had been fun and upbeat, but, out of nowhere, it just came to a screeching halt. It was at this point I realized that I was slowly becoming disengaged. Its not that Im against transforming a story into something more meaningfulcheck out my review for Seeking a Friend for the End of the Worldbut it needs to feel natural. Had they allowed some more time for the movie to play out, the transition could have been a lot smoother. Unfortunately, I think Gordon-Levitt felt obligated to keep it within an hour and a half simply because this is an independent film. At the end of the day, this left the story feeling a bit rushed.

Still, considering there were a lot of areas for this movie to go wrong, its no small feat that this was my only complaint. Seeing Jon go through his weekly routine never got old, and observing the way he interacted with Barbara was both entertaining and brutally honest. Todays relationships are so broken due to the medias influence on our lives, and I think Don Jon did a phenomenal job of portraying that. Also, the fact that JGL made us wait the entire movie to hear Jons sister Monica (Brie Larson) open her mouth drove me insane, but I was glad that when she finally spoke her input was both profound and meaningfulshowing us that even though young adults may appear disinterested, they are still paying attention.

Finally, the performances across the board were fantastic. We already know Gordon-Levitt can act, but he continues to show his range with his performance as Jon. Then there was Scarlett who felt perfectly cast as Barbara. Part of me wanted to strangle her by the end of the movie, but that was because of Barbaras character, not Scarletts acting. Also, Tony Danza and Glenne Headly performed wonderfully as Jons parents, Jon Sr. and Angela, respectively. The only thing that kind of irritated me about the performances was that, at times, the Boston(?) accents sounded a little forced. Johansson was the worst, but none of the cast members were exempt from over-doing it a bit. Last but not least, you have Julianne Moore who probably gave my favorite performance from the entire film as the experienced, yet troubled Esther. All around a really solid group of actors who did a great job of bringing these characters to life.

Overall Score: 8.7/10 - When you really break it down, Don Jon is a romantic comedy just like any other. However, the characters in this story are more unique and fleshed out when compared to your average RomCom. While it may have its flaws, I had a blast watching it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different. Word of advice, though, don't bring your kids because the film is very, very sexual.",1385596800,11,5474,4.712643678160919
5830112,4,B00DL477I0,"DON JON is a really good film from writer-director-star Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He plays Jon, a young New Jersey Catholic with a penchant for porn.  Although perfectly able to attract several girlfriends, he prefers to watch simulated sex on his computer, something that ensuring the eventual breakup of his relationship with Barbara (Scarlett Johansson).  It is only when he encounters middle-aged widow Esther (Julianne Moore) on his university course that he learns to reform.  The film makes great comic play out of the contrast between Jon's sexual appetites and the respectability of his life; he regularly confesses his sins in church and visits his family every week for dinner.  But then Jon himself seems unaware of this disparity, which is perhaps inevitable, given his inability to understand what other people around him are thinking.  Scarlett Johansson turns in a nice performances as the gum-chewing, eminently respectable Barbara, contrasted with the more worldly-wide Esther.  But the film belongs to Gordon-Lewitt (as actor), whose gradual change of character is signaled through minimalist gestures and/or changes of expression.  Very well worth watching.",1385596800,3,1174,5.556179775280899
5830113,5,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon was an emotional, funny, and in your face cinematic presentation that leaves you thinking. It's an excellent portrayal of what men think and how they confuse fantasy with reality. How it can twist your mind and leave you unsatisfied because of illogical expectations. I loved this movie. It was a bit embarrassing here and there, but its message is undeniable and I really want to thank Joseph Gordon Levitt for putting himself out there to say something real.  Don't take kids under 15 to this movie it's inappropriate for them.  Don't take your mom, don't take your family. Its for relationships that need a different perspective. It's not a porn movie it's a reality movie.",1384732800,,684,4.837606837606837
5830114,4,B00DL477I0,"Don Jon is a witty and thoughtful film about relationships. Jon treats everything in his life as objects he gains pleasure from, including the women he ""scores"" every weekend. But nothing can compare to the porn he accesses on his computer. The real life girls have the complications of being, well, REAL and don't always exactly match his lofty expectations. The porn girls don't disappoint, so he always returns to them.

Jon is a creature of habit - from his workout routine, to going to church (and confession, although he never actually changes his behavior), to cleaning his apartment, to Sunday dinner with his family (his family is wonderfully portrayed by Tony Danza, Glenn Headly and Brie Larson. All hilarious and convincing). When he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johannson), things are turned somewhat upside down. She's a true ""10"" and Jon is willing to change himself to get a chance to sleep with her. As much as Jon objectifies her as a sex object, she also objectifies him to be ""starring"" in one of the romantic movies she loves and tries to model her life after. Barbara has lot of qualifications that Jon has to conform to in order to be with her (go to school, get a better job, get a cleaning lady, etc.).

About half-way through the film, Jon meets Esther (Julianne Moore), an older woman who helps him to discover more about sex and connections and eventually himself. Jon's interactions with Esther are what elevates this movie from a witty rom-com to a real commentary on searching for oneself and forging true connections with others.

The beginning of the movie plays like a rom-com and is filled with lots of laughable moments. But as it goes on, it becomes a more serious commentary on how to open yourself to another person and how to transform One warning - if you're sensitive to frank sex talk or porn images, skip this one.",1383609600,123,1853,4.730650154798762
5830115,4,B00DL477I0,"'Don Jon' uses the medium of film to ask audiences to think about how they allow film and other media to shape their expectations for love and life. It also shows how unfulfilling it is to go through the same routines day after day, thoughtlessly, interested only in fulfilling expectations and impressing others. While short and uncomplicated, it's surprisingly layered and can supply plenty of fodder for thoughtful discussion.

At first, Jon is totally lacking in self-awareness, focused on shallow surface attitudes and grooming his image as a buff guy who only sleeps with women rated ""8"" and above -- without taking anything any further than that, because while he enjoys his reputation, he's more interested in the simple bliss he finds watching porn than in pursuing real-life women for deeper relationships. No need to think or do much when the ladies are on the other side of the screen. Barbara seems to be his perfect counterpart -- she's hot and that reflects well on Jon, so whether or not they're actually a good match is much less important. Barbara, meanwhile, has been brought up to believe that her princesslike beauty means she deserves a romcom storyline, but things aren't that simple. Circumstances lead Jon to meeting Esther, seemingly an unlikely associate, but rather than extracting promises in from him the manner that Barbara does, Esther just gets him thinking. A deliberate shift in tone and handling as the film progresses communicates Jon's awakening and breaking free of his patterns.

'Don Jon' won't please everyone, or you may want to be choosy about who you see it with, if anyone. (Everyone I've seen it with enjoyed it, but I've heard reports of it making things awkward.) Jon's attitude toward porn is frankly displayed and some may not be able to see past that. Some may not be interested in Jon's point of view as an unreliable narrator with little self-awareness and won't stick with the film to its sweet, if somewhat rushed, ending. But as a broad lesson that asks us to be thoughtful about our media consumption, it's a certain charmer.",1383609600,8,2083,4.9147727272727275
5830116,3,B00DL477I0,"This is a weird indie film about a guy with a severe porn addiction to the point that he literally ""loses himself"" in those moments, but can't during sex.  The film also has a pre-occupation with trying to promote missionary position.  It's very Catholic.  Think of him as a less homicidal Patrick Bateman... without a maid.

I just didn't find the film that funny.  It became rather serious and disturbing later.  The main character and his fellow pothead friends are incredibly shallow, too.  The nightclub scenes are simplistic and one-note.  There's an older character that is suffering a major loss and seems also sad and vulnerable.  The revelations it reaches are not mysterious and are pretty elementary on most of these subjects.  It's just another form of confession.

As a close-up of a license plate suggests, Don Jon has more in common with ""Garden State"" than ""This is the End"".  But don't expect the number of laughs as either of those, let alone a-laugh-a-minute.  Like Man of Steel, the trailer was better.  (Trailer #3 is a work of art, but I digress.)  In this case, the full movie is also a little different in tone.

And there's lots and lots of porn and sex.  If I had known how much there was in this, I wouldn't have gone to see this in a public place (which I find really strange), let alone taken a foreign friend to it who's from a sexually-repressed country.  I can't imagine any adult justifying why kids should be allowed in the film.  It needed an NC-17 rating.  The subject matter is adult-only.

Besides the blatant honesty of the movie, the most redeeming quality of it was the depiction of a clean-cut and apartment-cleaning male in a movie.  I appreciated that.  I appreciated the character deciding there was something wrong with the lazy, slob, controlling Scarlet Johansen character.",1383436800,6,1822,4.769230769230769
5830117,4,B00DL477I0,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, directed and stars in ""Don Jon."" On the surface ""Don Jon"" is a sex comedy filled with fairly graphic sex and talk about sex, frequent flashes of clips from porn films, and lots of F-words. If you are squeamish about such things, don't see it. But if you are willing, you can find a funny, generous, beautifully made reflection on control, realistic expectations, and how we might think differently about ways in which the entertainments we choose can can reinforce walls around us or light a way across bridges to connection.

Gordon-Levitt plays Jon, a twenty-something who orders his life according to rigorous routine, whether it's his gym workouts, his apartment-tidying, his arrival to join his parents and sister at Sunday mass, his weekly trips to the confessional, his wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am hookups with women he meets at the dance club where he and his friends hang out, or his viewing of carefully selected porn clips on his computer. Although he beds plenty of real women, he prefers porn because he gets exactly what he wants from it with no partner imposing her expectations on him.  Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johannson in a brilliant portrayal), a very hot-looking, gum-snapping Jersey princess who loves soft-focus romance movies, catches Jon's eye at the dance club. He really wants Barbara, but she plays hard to get. Trying to please her, he promises to give up porn, but it proves more difficult than he thought. Meanwhile, he meets Esther, a highly emotional, much older woman (Julianne Moore) at a evening college class he enrolls in to please Barbara. Esther challenges Jon in different ways.

The supporting cast, including Tony Danza (appropriately, given the movie's themes, the star of television's ""Who's the Boss?"") as Jon's domineering father, does a wonderful job. The stylized, rhythmic script and storytelling are not ""realistic,"" but they serve the story's themes well. If you care to come along given the content warnings, I think you will enjoy Jon's journey. The ending was a little too much too fast, so four stars out of five.

In case it's of interest, my husband and I saw this for a date night and we are in our fifties.",1381104000,,2193,5.0
5830118,4,B00DL477I0,"Indie sensation, JGL had a lot to prove when he set out to make his writing/directorial debut. Folks, let me tell you right now, he did it. Don Jon is a theatrical masterpiece. I say masterpiece because it manages to be a dramedy that both men and women can enjoy, as well as a smart cultural commentary on the misrepresentations of the sexes. Don Jon also explores the impossible expectations that set the foundation for many romantic relationships and it does so in both a thought-provoking and funny way. It's a breath of fresh air.

Just as JGL's character is trying to find himself, you can see where he struggles to find his directorial voice. Don Jon feels too meticulous and familiar at the start, a little like a Darren Aronofsky film, but eventually he settles into a comfortable rhythm, one that feels uniquely his. He's got a great narrative voice, his timing is impeccable and, most important, there's actual depth underneath all the tongue-and-cheek humour. JGL wisely balances the bawdier material with a touch bold honesty. Don Jon does the impossible by turning the notion of GTL into a work of art, and if JGL can start off with this much of a bang, I think he's got a very promising career ahead of him.

On the surface, Jon is your stereotypical Jersey Shore jerk. But underneath that macho exterior lies a man who needs to lose himself in something. And that something just so happens to be porn. On the surface, Barbara seems like his perfect girl. But Jon quickly learns that what you see is not always what you get. JGL is charming and charismatic as the leading stud, Don Jon. He actually makes a sleazy man likeable. Who knew?! But then again, are you really surprised?

That just speaks to his raw talent as an actor. While I usually find Scar-Jo to be wooden, she is both a bombshell and willfully strong here. There's a surprising subtlety to her performance that I haven't seen from her before. And behind strong leads there's a solid secondary cast. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are PERFECT hamming it up as Jon's parents. I have to say, Tony Danza absolutely kills it! And though Brie Larson's part is small, as Jon's tech-absorbed sister, her character is what perpetuates such a dramatic shift in the film. I thought the casting was pretty spot on sans Julianne Moore's role. It's not that her character wasn't believable, because it was --- she's a no frills, observational truth-seeker. Everything that character needed to be. It was just her as that character that I wasn't quite buying.

But as a whole, I thought the film was nearly perfect. There is more than meets the eye with Don Jon, which is ironic because that notion is pretty much the core of the entire movie. You watch it to be entertained but walk away with something meaningful to talk about. Don Jon is about letting people in so that they can see the deepest parts of you. It's about the ability to really let yourself go, to know what it feels like to be free. I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that explores the intricacies of love, friendship and sex with as much finesse as Don Jon does. And while it IS a love story, it's also very much a movie about self-discovery. Let's just say, I haven't felt that emotionally satisfied walking out of a theatre in a very long time.

Food for Thought: Don Jon is a solid debut by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's written a touching movie about love and sex, men and women. It's a movie that teaches us how to recognize when we've become victims of false fantasies and shows us the meaning of true intimacy. Don Jon truly is a dime with a smart soul and heart of gold.",1381104000,,3613,4.552307692307692

Its a great character study of all the ways people/we 'use' and objectify people to be/get what we want. On the surface it looks like it's about sex and sexual objectification, but its actually shows many ways of objectification, including how women objectify men.

(minor spoiler alters)  The obvious objectification is sexually objectification. The less obvious is how his girlfriend wants him to be something he isn't and she tries to manipulate him into being what she wants (going to school, making money...). His mom wants him to be what she wants (to get married, have kids and 'be happy', according to her) and keeps pushing him into it, not listening at all to what he wants. He objectifies him self. There is very little authentic relating and connecting.
Then he meets a woman who is emotional and messy. He learns how to feel and about connecting with someone on an emotional level.
