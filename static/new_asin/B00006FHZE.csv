1746392,4,B00006FHZE,"Some of my readers might have very warm recollections of the 1967 black and white BBC mini-series (from before, I believe, the term was coined) that brought to life in 26 episodes and 21 hours  all six of the nine novels written by John Galsworthy under the supertitle ""The Forsyte Saga."" Few video adaptations quite as good were  to come again until ""The Pallisers"" attracted millions, and both would be very difficult to improve upon. Well, Granada has tried with what might be an 18 part remake of the Galsworthy saga; and the first series of 6 is now available on three DVDs from Acorn Media.
 Taken on its own terms, it is extremely good--but not perfect--and had me and wife pretty well riveted to the screen on three successive evenings. It did not, however, erase fond memories of the earlier version. Now the 1967 version was ""studio-bound, with static camera work, long scenes and long speeches"" (as the press release puts it). What the release leaves out was superb acting by established stars and by newcomer Susan Hampshire whose Fleur made her a star.
  For example, Eric Porter made Soames a sympathetic human who hurt himself more than he hurt others, especially his miserable first wife Irene. In the 2002 version, Damian Lewis, looking like a demonic Steve McQueen, is 99% pure villain; and his mother's recollection of how he loved a pet cat to death does little to soften his character. It is only in the very last minute of the last episode that he softens--but I will not tell you why.
 Another problem is the actress playing Irene, Gina McKee. The original Irene was portrayed by the extremely beautiful Nyree Dawn Porter; and all of the comments in the script about her looks were not contradicted by what we saw of her. Here (at the risk of being attacked for being another John Simon), McKee is simply attractive but by no means beautiful. In fact, some of the profile shots make her quite unattractive; and somehow all the praises the other characters  sing about her are not justified visually. Then too, Soames' sister, played in 1967 by Margaret Tyzack, was always referred to as unattractive and lucky to catch a husband at all, even if he is a ""bounder."" Here Amanda Root, being very pretty indeed, draws no such disparaging comments in this new script.
 The rest of the cast-- Ioan Gruffudd, Rupert Graves, Gillian Kearney, Corin Redgrave, and so many more that I could only wish Acorn Media had provided a booklet with the cast as it did for ""The Pallisers""--can stand comparison with the 1967 actors.
 The production values are just fine, but all too often the camera work becomes annoyingly ""innovative"" when one character close to the camera is speaking to one further away, and they are brought alternatively in and out of focus as they speak or listen.
 But, as a comic Shakespearean character says, comparisons are odious. Again, on its own terms, this is a very enjoyable if somewhat flawed remake of (so far) the first two Forsyte novels; and I can honestly recommend them for once and future viewing as I look forward to the next releases when they are filmed. But let us yet hope for some Kind Soul to restore the 1967 version not too long in the future.",1031356800,99,3198,4.694642857142857

1746457,1,B00006FHZE,"The Forsyte Saga is one of the great classics, but bears almost no resemblance to this production. It might have been possible to enjoy as a totally unrelated invention, despite some ludicrous anachronisms, but it does have one thing in common with the novels - everything revolves around the central character of Irene. I am mystified. I would rather not be uncharitable, but they have kind of left themselves wide open here. The casting of this character is so wrong, she has been made to look almost like a man in drag. This has been covered in other reviews, but she looks twenty years older than and towers over every male character she is played against, as well as being about as animated as a fence post. It ruins any chance this version had of succeeding, on any level.
Since this is prime, I do recommend fast forwarding to the last part of episode 4, for the hilariously bad costuming, making Irene look eerily similar to Margaret Hamilton as the wicked witch in The Wizard of Oz.",1508544000,,991,4.604519774011299
1746458,4,B00006FHZE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series based upon the trilogy of books written by John Galsworthy. As to  whether it is a faithful a adaptation, I cannot say, having never read them. What I can say is that this Masterpiece Theatre adaptation will hold the viewer in its thrall. As with all such Masterpiece Theatre productions, it proffers cogent scripts, beautiful costume, great casting, and excellent acting.

This series tells the story of the fractured Forsyte family, warts and all. It begins towards the end of the nineteenth century and continues for  decades. Rivalries are revealed, petty hatreds burgeon and seethe, love and desire bubble over, and the foibles of all the characters are laid open for all to see with the passing of time. It is truly an engrossing family  saga, as one becomes absorbed with the unfolding of their lives.

My criticisms of season one are few and far between. While the men can be seen to age a bit, the women seem ageless. Moreover, I did not see the fascination that the character of Irene had for the men in her sphere. I also did not find her particularly likeable, but that is to be expected when a married woman enraptures and carries on with her best friend's fiance. Still, overall, it was a very enjoyable period piece that had an authenticity of time and place.",1508025600,,1307,4.714912280701754

I was unfamiliar with Damian Lewis at the first viewing, and now I've loved him in Homeland, and most recently in Billions, so I have quite a different take on seeing him playing Soames now.  To me, Soames' character is limited emotionally.  He's a brilliant businessman, but relationships, not so much.  His wife Irene really is not the nicest person, but has the ability to charm men, (spoiler alert!) and even her good friend who's fianc she steals away from her.  I did find myself asking why someone would passionately fight for someone who is supposed to be your friend, and then steals your boyfriend.  No bueno, but there it is.  Regardless of this stretch of the imagination, which left me feeling more than a little angry at yet another person falling for Irene's charms, I loved the series, and would have been glad if there were more episodes.",1500595200,,1018,4.611111111111111

Downton was sometimes cry-worthy sad, but there was lots to laugh at, too. One warning: There is a very violent rape scene. It's not gratuitous in any way. No actual nudity.

1746676,4,B00006FHZE,"Let me start by saying that this production of The Forsythe Saga offers a beautiful series that is well worth the time to watch, even though I did not find it to be an accurate portrayal of Galsworthy's characters or plot (ending especially).  Hang on to your hats and keep your scorecard handy - the Saga is a Victorian soap opera of epic proportions, with multiple characters over several generations.  ***And don't read any of the reviews until you've watched the series - spoilers abound.***

There are many excellent reviews here already, so mine will not repeat what you can read elsewhere.  I would like to add context as I counter one written by Angela G. Birt on April 26, 2011.  I wish we could be in the same room to dialogue about our differing interpretations of some of the characters, but since we cannot, I will leave my own opinions in my comment.  Perspective is all, as they say.

Birt's review was quite thorough, and an excellent summation of the primary characters and story lines. I agree with much of it -- in particular her beautifully expressed opinion of Damian Lewis, the actor playing Soames.  In another interpretation of the motives behind most of his truly despicable actions, the story might have fallen apart entirely. No human being is all evil, and if an actor can't portray a human being on stage or on the screen, the ship is sunk before it sails.  An audience (or reader) must feel some empathy for a central protagonist to care about the story at all. Birt does a beautiful job of describing the actions from Soames' point of view, and Lewis does a beautiful job of portraying Soames' point of view on the screen.

I believe Birt's empathy for Soames, however, has negatively colored her description of Irene - that, along with Gina McKee's portrayal, which I believe took Soames' lines about how ""cold"" she was to him too much to heart to make sense with the rest of the story. Who knows whether a relatively one-dimensional portrayal of younger Irene was the actress's choice or the director's, but it clearly didn't work to wait until much later in the Saga to allow us to see Irene's warmth.

In any case, even as portrayed in this version of the Saga, the character of Irene was not, as Birt says, ""a cold, vixen who made a choice to marry for money and then took up with every man who crossed her path - except her husband.""  She found it difficult to bed a man she did not love, and loved only TWO men - Bossiny, who died, & Joylon, whom she married once she was free to do so - certainly not ""every.""  She also, until Soames behavior became untenable, allowed him his ""conjugal rights"" - albeit unenthusiastically (common in Victorian times, btw).

One must keep in mind that Soames' allegations of Irene's behavior were untrue, and that, despite their obvious fondness for one another, Irene and Joylon did not become lovers until *after* Soames unleashed his temper, accusing them both of adultery, threatening that he intended to include their supposed infidelity in his divorce suit, ""to the utter destruction of them both"" -- which, from Soames' myopic world view, would leave Irene no choice but to return to him to bear him a son.

Exit Soames, consumed by anger and swearing revenge, Joylon collapses in Irene's arms over his sincere grieving for his son - whom he had just learned had died. Fade to black - pick up their consummated relationship later.

Nor does Irene end up with ""virtually every other man in the story,"" as Birt writes -- one of the other characters says that in anger, but it is not the case.  In the end, actually, Irene goes off alone - without even the company of her much beloved son, while Robins Nest, the home she loves that was built for her by Bossiny, is left behind ""to let or for sale.""

Irene's ""choice"" to marry for money, as Birt sees it, was actually no choice at all.  Her stepmother forced it upon her - symbolized in the scene where the door was closed in Irene's face, following the lines that might as well have been ""I will no longer support you, respond to Soames or you're out on the street.""  In Victorian England, that meant LITERALLY ""on the street"" for a woman in Irene's position - which would, of course, have been unthinkable.

Nor did she deceive Soames, declaring that she loved him, as did Soames' daughter Fleur in order to marry the besotted, titled & propertied Michael Mont, in a hasty and angry rebound from Joylon's son Jon (whom she saw as ""hers"" in a manner in which broken-hearted Jon felt was too close to how her father considered his mother Irene). To the best of her ability as a Victorian woman, Irene attempted to ""negotiate"" her position before accepting Soames' proposal - ""If it isn't happy, you will let me out.""  He gave his word to her that he would, subsequently asserting his sole ""right"" to her time, attention and body as one of his *possessions* in many ways after their marriage - through actions that set the stage for the brutal - and pivotal - rape.

Admittedly, this production does not do an adequate job of portraying how Soames attempted to cut Irene off from contact with anyone but him - the reason behind the hiring of budding architect Bossiny (one of the few people with whom she was permitted to interact) to design and construct Robins Nest - that house that Irene would later comment ""was built to be [her] prison.""

The contrast between Bossiny's warmth and love of beauty and Soames' cold obsession with money and ownership -- shown here via his angry lawsuit with Bossiny, ostensibly over a cost overrun of a relatively small amount of money that Soames could easily afford, the cost of which lawsuit would likely bankrupt Bossiny and the loss of which could ruin his career -- kindled the flame of their love, making it impossible for Irene to continue the charade of her marriage to Soames after he raped her. Without funds of her own, she left him, taking little but the clothes on her back - not Soames' gifts of jewels or clothing, which I trust argues against any accusation of her own obsession with money.

I believe that Irene (as well as Joylon) were written to contrast sharply with the view given language by the french Annette (Joylon's second wife, whom he married simply to give him the son he hoped for) -- that status, reputation, property and finances was what marriage was about, and that one looked for love elsewhere.  More than once, Joylon and Irene both risked everything else for love - just as Soames invested emotionally on the other side of the scale, despite his lifelong obsession mistaken for love for Irene.  The intended ending was one of regret, not satisfaction, for Soames, scripted here more for modern audience approval than fidelity to Galsworthy's more somber point of view.

I also disagree with Birt's review of June, particularly the ""false""ness of June's continued hatred for Soames as a singular projection of anger at other characters simply because ""he's a convenient target and easy to dislike.""  Of all of the Saga's characters, June is the most (what we in the 21st century would call) balanced and emotionally healthy. She forgives ""mistakes of the heart,"" because she is another hyperbole contrasted to the ultimate lack of importance of fortune, property, and public reputation held dear by many of the Forsythes.

June sees straight through actions to motives. She cannot abide hypocrisy or betrayal any more than she has any degree of tolerance for the idea of ""ownership"" of another human being.  I believe she continues to despise Soames while she is ultimately, according to Brit, ""able to forgive everyone else everything"" because she sees that Soames' underlying behavior is intractable and dehumanizing, whether it is fueled by hurt or temper. Gillian Kearney delivers a wonderfully nuanced and multi-dimensional performance, by the way, and I didn't find a false note in her portrayal.

Bottom line: not exactly Galsworthy's Forsythe Trilogy, but a Saga worth watching nonetheless. (Oh yes, and Amazon's listing descriptions of the episode contents are ""off"" - so keep track by number as you move through them).

1746677,3,B00006FHZE,The actress playing Irene Forsyte is annoying. She is cold and pale. Not enchanting at all.,1459728000,3,91,4.75
1746728,5,B00006FHZE,"I LOVE this series, but ONLY because of Damien Lewis. He is, yes, a romantic, hopelessly in love, and Victorian in every sense.

Irene, however, was awful. She's not so attractive, and she has a skeletal appearance about her which makes her indeed seem so cold, so when she does fall for Bosinney, it seems unnatural. If she is the compassionate and free-spirited liberal independent and mysterious woman she wants to portray, (the very beguiling thing that draws her to so many men for different reasons), she must also display an undercurrent of tragic sympathy or even pity for the plight of Soames. However, her interaction with him is patently frigid and cold, haughty, and cruel, since Soame's only crime was loving her too much, in the only way he knew how. Going into the marriage she already set herself up for failure, like a verbal prenup. Only she has no leverage for a prenup so it was ridiculous, especially for that time, and for Soame's.

I WANT to be sympathetic to Irene, and I want to appreciate the complexity of her position, but I can't help but remember that she was the one who removed herself from the first proposal, then after Soames had clearly moved on, she jumpstarts a second proposal on him, to which Soames kindly and surprisingly consents. If she had just stuck to her guns, she could very well be the bohemian indie queen she fancies herself, but no. The need to eat and the craving for status and prestige prove far too much for the hypocritical Irene. Irene is a leech, unable to free herself in the truest sense of the word, constantly finding herself in the mires of the Forsytes, entangling herself in their lives without impunity. If she is the free bird she so desires to be, why does she find herself in the Forsyte cage so very often?

In my eyes, if you look at the bare facts, this is what I see: Soames, an extraordinarily devoted husband, (and his look is up for debate but I think he's gorgeous). Irene, supposedly a beautiful Pre-Raphaelite goddess with piano skills but is really just a home wrecker, a misanthrope, a hypocrite,  leech, and generalized icicle. I really like the other characters, from Gran, June, and even the eye-roll-inducing Bosinney.

1746730,1,B00006FHZE,"The Forsythe Saga had the potential to be a marvelous series, yet the character of Irene Heron ruined it with her stiff stature, homely, depressing appearance, and ice cold treatment of Soames, while falling for every other Forsythe man except Soames' father. I didn't view the original, so I don't know how that was cast. The actress who played Irene, Ms. McKey, ruined the entire series for me. Lots of good acting on everyone else's part, including a brilliant performance by Damiem Lewis as Soames. Irene is the most confused, cold character I've seen in sagas of this nature. For instance, after her father died, her step-other told Irene she'd have to get married or get a job. Irene look dumbstruck at this idea and instead went to Soames to accept his marriage proposal. I felt sorry for Soames, when he couldn't get his obsession for Irene out of his head. He chased her, with her plain, depressing looks throughout most of the sagas. Then Irene whisks the fiance of young June Forsythe, into bed quickly. Phil the finance of June appeared young enough to be Irene's son which proved for strange bedroom scenes with those two. Love can sometimes be a tortured thing and Irene should never have agreed to marry Soames, in the first place, but gotten a job. She agreed to marry him for his money, of course, as she was destitute, while loathing him and complaining about the marriage to a level of tiredness. I wondered why she didn't divorce him and stop complaining, through Season one. And all the men from young to older who chased after her? What could they see in her but what she presented herself to be--plain, homely, dark, depressive, hard as stone, and cold as ice. Young June was right in the beginning when she said Irene destroys men and everyone she, herself, loves, for a fact she did. Also Irene's character looked much too old for her young male conquests. Mis-cast. Irene is lazy, sits around with a blank look on her face, and ""kept"" by many men in this saga, when she is actually a strong woman capable of making her own way in the world. When all is said and done, Irene's first husband was perfectly suited for her since he was in second running for cold personas. She missed the boat, so to speak, for not staying with him. I did get one touching moment  in Saga II when Soames holds his baby daughter, by a second wife, for the first time. It shows he's human and can love, unlike Irene who probably gave the young Jolien a son only because Soames had begged her for one. Irene complained about Soames the entire saga while Soames chased her and begged for a son which pretty much sums the saga. Irene was the downfall of this saga, no doubts there.",1457740800,7,2681,4.550724637681159

Gina Mckee played Irene, Soames's wife, was devoid of emotion, that must have been a piece of cake, character for her, she just had to say the lines, no acting required.

1746828,1,B00006FHZE,"SPOILERS AHEAD! I don't know what compelled me to finish the entire season. I guess I was just hoping that it would get better. It didn't. My biggest problem with it is that there is no one who is compelling or charming or even attractive. There's no one with chemistry. There is no character to feel sympathetic toward. Of course, the rape scene is horrible and makes you hate Soames, but it doesn't make me really root for Irene either. She's not a likable character. There's no one to get behind and cheer for. Everyone is equally boring and unappealing.

Also, when Joliyn (idk how to spell that ridiculous name) and Irene end up together and his daughter walks in on them in bed after Irene has just had their child?! And she didn't even know they were together? Worst father of the year. The plot line is so twisted yet still not particularly interesting.",1452816000,8,861,4.554838709677419

She and Bosinney seemed very miscast. He looked like a child next to her. My dislike of her character or maybe it's the actress herself, plus the dysfunction makes it unenjoyable. Damien Lewis is a wonderful actor, and he plays the part of nasty Soames quite well, but it's very unenjoyable to watch. I'd rather do laundry.",1451088000,9,488,4.556818181818182

The actors were very good; Rupert Graves and Damien Lewis were excellent.  My favorite, though, was the guy from Coupling who played Monty Darty.  The plot was engrossing; as I said, I don't remember the book at all, so I cannot tell how true it was to the book.

The filming was excellent, scenery and costuming lovely.  Minor quibble, the men appeared to age somewhat, but the adult female characters did not.  I swear that Ireny and Winnifred didn't age a day from the moment we met them to the story's end.",1448841600,,651,4.4576271186440675

1747048,3,B00006FHZE,"Interminable story....  but great acting saves it to a certain extent. While realizing this story is from a different time and place, the number of times Soames tries to win back his wife is incomprehensible and unbearable to watch. The phrase, ""she's just not that into you"" played through my mind more than once. However, that's a fairly flip response to what is, after all, in part a story of obsession and if you buy into the obsession the story will probably be engrossing, though it still might be difficult to fathom why so many men fall madly in love with Irene, whose character is a bit of a cipher. But maybe that's the point - the men who fall madly in love with her project their fantasies and desires onto her because she seems like a blank slate. Perhaps the books, which I have not read, make it clear why men are so infatuated with her.

That said, even though I had difficulty with some of the characters' motivations, I found some of the episodes deeply moving, particularly the one in which Irene and Old Jolyon become very close. Corin Redgrave's performance as Old Jolyon, one of the most interesting and compassionate characters, is nothing short of miraculous. Gina McKee's scenes with Redgrave were among the most convincing of her low-key portrayal of Irene, and I felt those two characters had real chemistry and truly loved and understood each other. I was sad when that episode ended. Overall, the acting is the strength of the series, showcasing the intelligence, passion, and versatility of generations of British actors.",1446768000,5,1551,4.7835820895522385

1747341,4,B00006FHZE,"Highly recommend. I liked it a lot.  I have only 2 minor criticisms of this adaptation:
(1) Irene should have been played by an actress that is drop-dead gorgeous. Gina McKee is not that actress.
(2) This is the short version. The longer version (includes much more detail) can be seen in PBS's original 1967 black & white adaptation. I think I'm enjoying the black and white version as much or more than the colorized one!",1444262400,,423,4.565789473684211

1747376,5,B00006FHZE,"I don't know where to start it was so enjoyable. Period pieces are one of my favorites. Every nuance has to be dissected to make it authentic, writing, adaptation, characters and directing. One of my favorite actor in his part was Colin Redgrave. He played old Jolyon. He grew into an even greater man, someone that I just learned to love. I was perplexed with Gina McKee as Irene. Even when she seemed happy or showed emotion she was still at arms length. There were times when I almost sorry for Soames (Damien Lewis).  It may have been her part or an illusion of it but she was cold. Her performance  was not my favorite. Shames was indeed exactly what the writers wanted him to be. His anger was intense. A great performance by Damien Lewis. In any scene he was in it was all about him and the character But I still go back to Irene, maybe if she once reached out to him could she have given us a glimpse of his other side. Rupert Graves wonderfully cast. He was a wonderful  contrast to an otherwise family of statistics. This was another of Masterpieces masterpieces. Will watch this again for many years to come.",1444176000,2,1119,4.422330097087379
1747377,5,B00006FHZE,"Acting is so believable for the entire cast.  Whoever did the casting should get a raise.  The clothing, scenery and music all blend. I find myself watching this frequently and find it an amazing acting adventure.  Highly recommend this .",1444176000,,238,4.9

1747413,5,B00006FHZE,"I'm a sucker for British family sagas and this sets the standard that all others strive to meet.  The acting is superb, the story intriguing, the backgrounds are stunning.  It's a good introduction to Damian Lewis, if you've never seen him before.  His rigidity throughout this story became more and more pronounced until by the end, he could barely move at all.  I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys this sort of thing.",1444176000,,424,4.6891891891891895

1747457,3,B00006FHZE,The acting is fine. Gina McKee was as good as Nyree Dawn Porter but the actor who played Soames was too villainous for my taste and not as believable as Eric Porter. Kenneth More was superb as young Jolyen in the original. The actor who played the part in this version was good but not quite as good as More.,1443657600,,308,4.15

1747509,5,B00006FHZE,"Great series from 2002, which I only just now discovered. Intriguing storyline and great acting, as usual from the Brits. My only quibble is that the video quality has evidently not been remastered in HD, so the image is quite soft and fuzzy, which is really too bad.  In addition, the narrative oftentimes skips (or glosses over) major events, such as key marriages or births, so that we only discover them after the fact.  Still, a very worthy series!",1443139200,,453,4.7215189873417724

1747920,4,B00006FHZE,"I am so delighted to find that I am in good company here with my distaste for the casting of McKee as Irene Forsyte. This is an excellent, well-done production in every possible way and all the characters are so good--Irene is the sole exception and that's why it's such a pity that Gina McKee was cast to play her. I in fact loathed her portrayal so very much that I can hardly bear to watch her scenes, which is difficult since she is in most of them. Instead of possessing an ethereal, passionate quality, Mckee's Irene is cold, unfeeling, frozen, insipid. June is right when she says ""you are a leech. You have no life about you yourself, so you suck it out of everyone around you."" She hit the nail on the head. It's painful to watch a character that is played to be so passive, so lacking in charisma, so dull and spiritless. Gina McKee is too old for the role, and lacks the beauty, charisma and sexual magnetism to bring it off and make us believe that several men could fall madly in love with her  against their better judgement. Her affair with Bosinney is almost difficult to watch because the idea of him falling for her over the younger, more attractive and passionate June just isn't believable. Next to Grufudd McKee looks like his mother. Yes, I agree with the other viewers that she even looks too old for Soames--we are supposed to believe that this woman is young enough to be starting to think about having children? She looks to be in her early 40s when she marries Soames, and that's WITH a whole slew of makeup in an attempt to make her look younger. When he begins to woo her in Bournemouth we're supposed to see her as a slip of a girl, and instead she appears matronly. By the time she gives birth to John, she looks ancient. They should have cast a woman about ten years younger as Irene. A woman who is able to convey subdued passion and charisma--McKee, while a good actress, just doesn't have what it takes to play Irene. And it's a real shame, because Itene is a central character and crucial to the story. If it weren't for Irene's casting, I would give the production five stars. Corin Redgrave is wonderful as Jolyn Sr.--his warmth alsmot comes through the screen. Rupert Graves is great as his son. Lewis's portrayal is masterful, and the proof of that is that I came away having more sympathy for his character than Irene's, even though he is meant to be quite a brute. I enjoyed the casting of Fleur, Michael Mont, Profond, etc--and Ben Miles was WONDERFUL as Dartie. Absolutely wonderful. If only we had gotten a different Irene!",1419638400,2,2568,4.475479744136461

Gina Mckee fails to breath life into Irene Forsyte, i suppose no-one told her  that she needed to bring more to her performance than sullenness...four episodes was just about all that i could take.",1414800000,2,480,4.370786516853933

1747989,4,B00006FHZE,"This teetered on the line of being horrible and very good. The reason for horrible is because the 2 main characters, Soames and Irenie, are quite unlikeable. They are both hard, cold, and unemotional. I know that there is dialog where Soame's mother talks about him loving too much and dialog about Irenie being artistic and emotional, but that doesn't come across for either of them. As for Irenie being a raving beauty that everyone falls for, well, that's quite unbelievable as well. She impressed me as being a selfish brat.

What makes it work though, is the universal humanity. Everyone knows what it is like to be judged, unwanted, and stuck. Everyone knows what it longing and love feel like. So even if these don't feel like people you can relate to, they are situations you can relate to. It tugs a nerve.

I think it could have been done better, but it will still quite enjoyable.",1408924800,,891,4.632911392405063

1747995,5,B00006FHZE,"If you fall under the spell of the characters in this Forsyte Saga, you will find this series fairly riveting.  The Forsyte family and their relationships and lives is the focus here.  They are living at the end of the Victorian era and the dawning of the Edwardian era in London and its environs.  There is family intrigue anchored by the main plot in which solicitor Soames Forsyte (Damian Lewis) marries a poorer young woman, Irene Heron (Gine McKee) in an unfortunate mismatch.  Soames seems to want to acquire a wife the way in which he would acquire property, as a legal and business proposition without much emotion.  Adultery ensues which is frowned upon in the Victorian Age.

Other family members have their own little drama - Winnifred Forsyte also made an unfortunate mismatch with one of the more eccentric, despicable and entertaining members of the cast, Montague Dartie (Ben Miles), who is a relentless bounder and also dabbles in adultery. He gets some of the best lines.  Seeing him demonstrating a tango with one of his male friends is one of the more humorous scenes in this otherwise mostly dramatic and serious drama.

Damien Soames is obsessed with winning control of Irene and producing a male heir to carry on the Forsyte name.  How he deals with his doomed desire, and how it impacts others' lives, knits the story together.  Really enjoyed the character young Jolyon (Rupert Graves - who plays a detective in the current SHERLOCK series) who is a cousin of Soames and quite different from him.  The dialogue is interesting, and the sets of these Victorian backgrounds you want to stop the scene and just look at the rooms.  Found this a thoroughly engaging series so far that only gets better.

Great acting, costumes, interior decorating, scenery, etc., bring this timeless story to vivid life.  I am so pleased that Amazon has chosen to include free access to this & other similar video productions in my Prime membership.  I will be starting on Season 2 shortly.",1405296000,,625,4.6454545454545455

1748161,2,B00006FHZE,It was an ok show but the graphic bedroom scenes were just a bit too much. I wasn't very impressed with the actors in this one. I felt the story went on for too long. It could have ended by the second episode.,1404259200,,209,3.883720930232558

The Forsyte name is highy valued in this series, reminding everyone that they are always a station above everyone else. When love & passion become involved with it, the plot becomes totally engrossing.",1404086400,,289,4.918367346938775

1748186,1,B00006FHZE,Terribly depressing. Give the guy a chance. Wasn't able to finish because I didn't like characters. Too bad because it looked like it had potential.,1403740800,2,148,4.96

1748190,4,B00006FHZE,A great portrayal of this time period.  It has a good variety of characters.  It shows the natural consequences of ones choices.,1403481600,,128,4.7727272727272725
1748191,4,B00006FHZE,This is an outstanding series with two seasons.  It points out the competitive nature of siblings and how they face responsibility and family relationships.  It began when women had no say in their lives and thru generations the role of women changed.  It is also a wonderful love story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this series and would recommend it.,1403481600,,345,4.896551724137931
1748192,4,B00006FHZE,"Very watchable. Nice dowtown substitute but lacking in humor at most points. It's that classic old school bbc period piece where they hadn't quite mastered weaving in humor with all the drama. I remained engrossed throughout though and binged on it all. I almost didn't watch season 2 since I thought it would be like Dallas now verses 80s Dallas, with kids running the roost but it was a decent continuation and seeing Soames at the end was well worth it.",1403308800,,456,4.6419753086419755

1748194,5,B00006FHZE,"Set in London and contemporaneous with ""Downton Abbey"" this series is a superb distillation of Galsworthy's books, and written first-hand, not a screenwriter's fantasy.",1403136000,,168,6.041666666666667

1748228,4,B00006FHZE,"The movie was very good, it held my attention the whole way through.  There was also a good lesson about jealousy, how one person could ruin others lives if you let him.  How misserable he made himself and tried to make others but they went on with their lifes and he stayed behind.",1401753600,,282,4.30188679245283
1748229,1,B00006FHZE,"Irene and Soames having a conversation at the end makes a complete mockery of the storyline. All the changes made to the story in this series just confuses anyone not familiar with the original stories written by Galsworthy.  They are trying to bring today's values to a very Victorian story of social and personal repression.  Watching it, for me, was like watching a car wreck and seeing how badly it could turn out. I really wonder about filmmakers who think a woman really would have a civil conversation with her rapist. It certainly didn't happen in the book.",1401667200,,565,4.755102040816326
1748230,5,B00006FHZE,I have always loved period dramas and this one does not disappoint!  Damian Lewis is masterful in his role as Soames!,1401494400,,117,4.571428571428571
1748231,5,B00006FHZE,"I've watch the entire mini series twice now and it's just as great the second time around. You really have to feel for Soames, he just kept getting the short stick. But his road to redemption was worth watching.",1401408000,,211,4.435897435897436
1748232,4,B00006FHZE,A very good movie but not perfect. This movie was a visional period piece wealth watching. I would watch it again.,1401235200,,114,4.476190476190476
1748233,3,B00006FHZE,"The Forsyte Saga is absolutely amazing. Where in the world did they find that horse faced woman to play the leading role. It was all about how beautiful she was and she was so ugly. She did absolutely no acting, she had that same bored expression on her face the whole time and moved as thought she had a board on her back. Deadful! The supporting cast was all quite good - the only reason I gave it three stars.",1400716800,2,412,4.1625

1748266,5,B00006FHZE,Sad that there were few series filmed. Good cast and plot that kept me interested on the next episode. Great series to watch while using the trade mill,1400630400,,151,4.428571428571429

1748268,5,B00006FHZE,"Can remember seeing Forsyte Saga many many years ago on TV, so was pleasantly pleased to see the story once again. The characters and theme of  the saga is much as I remember, and will probably watch it again in the near future. It is a study of pride, jealousy, love and hate.",1400544000,,277,4.226415094339623
1748269,5,B00006FHZE,I enjoyed the Series and it left me wanting more. The actors and actresses were will casted. I had enjoyed Damien Lewis in Homeland and that is how I stumbled on this Series.,1400544000,,174,4.303030303030303

1748272,5,B00006FHZE,Two words-Damien Lewis.  He is the bad man and plays this to perfection.  I know I'll watch this again.  He can switch gears and play varies characters.  You gotta love him!,1400112000,,173,4.483870967741935
1748273,5,B00006FHZE,I loved this series!  The story line was great and the period costumes superb. I have recommended it to family and friends.  I sure wish they would continue the saga.,1400112000,,166,4.5
1748294,5,B00006FHZE,GREAT Series.  Hope you will have more similar series like The Forsyte Saga.  Is there going to be any more following these?,1400112000,,124,4.590909090909091

1748296,4,B00006FHZE,"As I don't give out 4 stars readily nor do I give 5 stars frequently, so I have to go with my prior rating of 4 stars as I watched this series several months ago. With 4 stars, it means the acting, dialogue, story acceleration and overall production was very well done. Enjoy!",1399852800,,276,4.226415094339623

1748299,5,B00006FHZE,"Both season 1 and 2 stole my heart. I was totally wrapped up in the characters both good and bad. As with any family there are secrets, The Forsyte Saga simply tells a story of how secrets weave there way through a family's life. My favorite part was watching how the family evolved and how they all dealt with life as the secrets were unraveled.",1399507200,,346,4.338461538461538
1748300,5,B00006FHZE,Didn't want to stop watching. Soames is such a nasty villain. Not really a complex plot but does keep moving along.,1399420800,,115,4.523809523809524
1748301,5,B00006FHZE,"Not much for TV, but my grandson installed Amazon and Netflix for me an showed me how to access their programming.  As I browsed, I found the Forsyte Saga and thought it intriguing.  Good study on human personalities and behaviors.  Very interesting and watched it all through the first series.  Good acting and plot.",1399334400,,317,4.814814814814815
1748302,3,B00006FHZE,"I doubt if I finish watching the first season of this one.  It is ok, but just no where near as good as Downton Abbey or Upstairs, Downstairs.  I never have understood Irene and her relationship with Soames.  He is very stiff, but her treatment of him is a little strange. In fact she is very strange!",1399334400,3,301,4.245614035087719

1748345,5,B00006FHZE,Enjoyd it. Loved the set and costumes. Acting was ok bt the story kept me watching. I would have cast Irene differently.,1398470400,,120,4.5
1748346,4,B00006FHZE,"I originally watched because I like Damian Lewis and I enjoy ""Sagas"".  I did NOT like it at first....however, after seeing the end of Series 2, the beginning became clear.  I spent some time reading the story info on Wikipedia.  I was sorry to see it end.  It did end well and I appreciated that.",1398384000,,296,4.327272727272727
1748347,5,B00006FHZE,"At the recommendation of a friend, I started watching the Forsyte Saga. I was immediately drawn by an outstanding script and cast. I have watched the series' more than once. Amazon Prime is fantastic!",1398038400,,200,4.911764705882353
1748348,3,B00006FHZE,"The content of this video was good--it was well done technically and the acting was very good.  Had I rated it on that alone, it would have gotten 4 stars.  However, the DVDs we received had NO closed captions for Series 1, even though there were there for Series 2, which was part of the same purchase, and even though the Amazon description for this product states that it is closed caption without stating it's Series 2 only.  Furthermore, when I sent a message to that effect to the seller, righpricedvd, I received no response whatsoever.  Not very good customer service. If I were rating rightpricedvd, I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  Because of my hearing and the British accent, closed captions are important to me for following the plot.  I have been able to watch the series with captions on Amazon Prime Instant, but now I am scratching my head about why I paid $40+ for something that's not nearly as useful as what I get on Amazon Prime.",1397779200,,953,4.511627906976744

1748350,4,B00006FHZE,It is wonderful to watch the Forsyte Saga if you have the emotional energy.  The character development is strong and you can't help feeling an emotional attachment to the characters.  Be sure you have a long day of ironing or cleaning out junk drawers because once you start you will want to watch until the last satisfying minute.,1397520000,,331,4.689655172413793
1748351,5,B00006FHZE,"If you love Downton Abbey, you will love Forsyte Saga, Season 1.  The acting is incredible and the actors so well suited to their roles.  The costumes are gorgeous and so detailed.  I lost myself in the characters and the era.",1397520000,,226,4.463414634146342

1748375,5,B00006FHZE,"Wonderful series. Couldn't help feeling sorry for Soames at unexpected times, for marrying a woman who did not ever love him. He should have let her go. My favorite character is June. She was able to forgive those who brought her immense pain in her life. Irene was unlikable in every way. She should never have married Soames and should have remained true to her free spirit. But then, there would not have been a saga. This series was beautiful and the actors were fantastic. Damian Lewis is an incredible actor. The best in this series.",1396310400,2,539,4.625
1748376,5,B00006FHZE,This was a great series that keep my interest..  The characters were well casted; acting was excellent.  I would watch it again.,1396051200,,128,4.7727272727272725
1748377,5,B00006FHZE,"I started watching this over a year ago on Netflix...but just couldn't get into it for some reason. So when I set up my Prime account, I decided to try it again and boy am I glad. I highly recommend this for those who like DRAMA during the times of old & what is deemed to be ""proper"" vs ""inappropriate"" in society.",1395964800,,315,4.096774193548387

1748379,3,B00006FHZE,"The acting is decent, the set quality is very good, but the characters leave little to be desired. I have read other reviews which pertain to the depiction of the characters by the actors--this could attribute to my feeling towards many of the characters. This show is very painful to watch at times because the characters have very little, well, character. Very few that we are shown give consideration to the emotional well being of their counterparts or any others around them. They present very little empathy and are very selfish, even those who claim not to be are so. If it tells you anything, I am inclined to feel the most for the supposed villain Soams. Of everyone, he is the one to have the most reasons to act the way he did, however questionable those actions were at times. He is steadfast in his beliefs and does not claim to be anything less or anything more than he puts forth, and for this reason, (even though he is a fictional character) I have a respect for him--strengths and weaknesses in all.",1395878400,,1017,4.562841530054645
1748380,4,B00006FHZE,"I would recommend this for those who like period pieces.  I thought that the character of Irene was unnecessarily cold/reserved.  The actress could have been directed to be more engaged, thus being more sympathetic.  Just my opinion; We do recommend this one, but have to get past the slow start. Enjoyed the whole story though.",1395705600,,328,4.927272727272728

1748382,5,B00006FHZE,"Another entry in my search for compelling viewing that enriches. Although privileged lives appear blessed, this series reveals the common desires and hopes for which each heart yearns. To me, the main heroine oddly appears more villainous while ironically the man deemed harsh is perhaps a casualty of the era and his wealth.",1395273600,,325,5.150943396226415
1748383,5,B00006FHZE,"Early on, I was not so enamored of The Forsyte Saga.  But as I continued to watch--all the way to the end of season 2-- I was captivated by the characterizations.  Every plot turn elicited an emotional response from me:  ""Oh no!""  ""O she can't leave now!""  ""What an egotistical creep!""  I really did have to see it through:  the younger generation repeating the sins of the elder generation, even while trying to distance themselves from their parents and the attitudes of the previous generation toward divorce, affairs, womanizing and the squandering of their estates.  This is British drama at its best, with beautiful period sets indoors and out, and wonderful actors throughout the generations.",1395273600,,699,5.017391304347826

A pace that allows you to genuinely care about the characters, to anxiously anticipate the next episode and sigh with regret when it's all over. I am sure I will watch this saga again. Excellent.",1394928000,,277,4.791666666666667

1748407,5,B00006FHZE,Good story telling from John Galsworthy. I recommend it for those persons interested in the Victorian era. The characters are believable and fully developed. I will continue the series via Kindle books.,1394582400,,202,5.34375
1748408,5,B00006FHZE,"Faced with a paternalistic culture, the heroine, Irene, prevails.  Irene is independent, critical of British sexism and yet vulnerable to the price independence ultimately brings.  Don't give up on her right at first.  She a woman in crisis, trying to survive.  There's plenty here to engage the audience: unrequited love, passion, family strengths and weaknesses, financial ups and downs, even a portrayal of prostitutes as products of chauvinism.",1394496000,,448,5.544117647058823

1748477,5,B00006FHZE,"I  did read the books (free on ebooks @ Amazon, iBooks, google books) after I watched the Series. The best part of this book is the fantastic author who didn't assign a good or bad to the main people. That is unusual, and He lets you choose for yourself. That keeps you running questions around in your mind and possibly seeing the reasons good people do things that are not good for the the self or others.  And maybe forgive them for it. Did Irene not try enough to make the marriage work? Was her husband totally to blame?  What horrible choices were made? I must say the book suggest there was never any marriage sex allowed by Irene, and her husband regrets what he did. This is the most difference in the book,  ( and that's a big difference) but most of the Series stays pretty true to it.

This is a great period series. It has lots of plots and subplots, and it easy to keep who is who. This has been a highly rated series that was well excepted when it was released. The actress and actresses are very talented. I am going to have to say Irene was miscast for her hardly being a beauty that all men were enchanted by. But her acting shines through to make you almost forget it ( almost...) thank you Amazon by a wise choice to make this a Prime streaming vid choice!

1748480,3,B00006FHZE,"""THAT FOSYTE WOMAN"" from the 1930s with Greer Garson was recently on TCM.  I was expectimg a lot from the 2 season series.

First:  DAMIEN LEWIS was and created the amazing ""Brody"" on HOMELAND.  He WAS BRODY.  But he couldn't have been worse as the Forsyte lead.

Second ... IRENE was played by the least desirable woman in all aspects that would make a man become so obsessed over.  There was nothing in the portrail that made me even imagine having a cup of tea, or even a short conversation with, were I part of the show.  DULL DULL DULL AND PLAIN WOMAN WITH NO WIT OR PERSONALITY or even a nice dresser.

FINALLY ... Just saying, but the grand country estate Soames built wa THE WRONG PERIOD.  IT WAS A CRAFTSMAN/LOYD WRIGHT HOME, AT LEAST 25-40 YEARS AHEAD OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PERIOD.  STUCK IN MY CRAW FOR THE LAST 2/3 OF THE SERIES.",1392249600,,846,4.358974358974359

1748509,3,B00006FHZE,"This series is really convoluted and ridiculous, and downright absurd much of the time. Yet, I kept watching it...and watching it and watching it--it seems very long after a while. I'm usually disappointed when a series ends, and I'd be happy to have an infinite number of seasons of Downton (which I am not comparing to this, and which I will admit has its own absurdities, but they are just so much more well done--even Mary's sullenness, which I'm starting to think she just needs a sandwich to make her feel better, but that's another review entirely). I was more than ready to be done with the Forsyte Saga when it finally ended. Mainly it was the wooden, annoying performance of the actress playing Irene and the shallow character of Soames that I was done with. Especially Irene. Ugh. Why would anyone want to be around Irene, even as an acquaintance, let alone as some irresistible object of desire?? Sorry, I don't see it. The same actress, I believe, was in Notting Hill, and played her role there quite well, though it called for a bit of resignation and sadness in it. Irene just seems like a cold, selfish person who takes what she wants and then feels sorry for herself about it. I was probably able to continue with this series only because we don't have cable and so I'm not already overloaded with the absurd and ridiculous from accidentally getting sucked into watching a reality show, and I don't have a thousand channels to choose from anymore.

So, it get's three stars: ""It's okay."" It is okay, but once was enough and I'll never feel the need to see it again. The reason I started watching it in the first place is because Rupert Graves is in it, whom I adored as a child when I saw A Room With a View (not that he's in that film all that much, but I so wanted Freddy as a brother). But that just made it kind of sad as this show keeeeept gooooiiinng...with him getting older and older (despite the fact that some of the other characters never seem to age much?! Though the irritating and dull Irene starts out looking 45 and, well, continues to look 45 over the course of however many decades). This definitely qualifies as a ""saga,"" as it goes on and on! If you are snowed in or down with a cold or, I don't know, a broken leg, give this a go. It'll kill several hours and might make you feel like your life isn't as complicated as you thought it was. And then go watch A Room With a View.",1391299200,,2414,4.388392857142857

She will not give him a baby bc she knows that she is trapped if she does so

At one point in the movie, they show the headstone of a main character ( Rupert Graves) which says he died at ""85"" but he didn't look a day over 50. His Aunts, as the movie went on, stayed the same and at the time of his death they were both suppose to be in their 100's. They kept jumping into the the future by putting on the screen blank years later but when they showed the characters they looked the same. The attention to detail was completely missing from this movie!!! The ending was really bad because, after what I guess to be a 60 year obsession and many lives ruined because of it, the main character ( Damian Lewis) finally gets over his ex wife. I didn't buy it!

1748642,5,B00006FHZE,"Soames Forsyte and his cousin Jolyon both love beauty, but the materialistic Soames wants to possess it whether in the form of persons or things, whereas the aesthetic Jolyon is content to appreciate it and strives, not too successfully, to create it through his own art.  The contrast in their personalities and moral outlooks plays out as their and their families' intertwining life stories unfold over several decades of evolving cultural mores.  The complex plot is clearly delineated and consistently engaging.  The dialogue is natural.  The characters are well-drawn and thoroughly human.  They all make mistakes, they all behave badly at times, but even the ""bad guys"" have moments of, if not precisely redeeming qualities, at least sympathetic ones.  The production values are outstanding with careful period costuming and settings in stately homes and gorgeous domestic interiors.  The actors, whether well-known names or performers I at least had never heard of, are first-rate.  A couple of minor negatives:  the first episode, which introduces an enormous number of characters and sets the main wheels of the plot in motion, is rather heavy going, but stick with it and you'll be well rewarded.  Second, in several scenes where characters are in disputatious conversation in which their points of view are diametrically opposed, the director chose to show both characters in the frame, but throw whichever of them was not speaking out of focus.  This technique not only belabored the obvious point that the characters were in conflict, but also proved quite distracting and visually annoying.  But these are minor quibbles.  The Forsyte Saga, Season 1 is a series not to be missed by anyone who enjoys sophisticated, literate period drama.",1388707200,,1751,5.255395683453237
1748643,5,B00006FHZE,"Damien Lewis is a formidable actor.  Perfect actor to portray Soames Forsyte, a not very likeable person, but sad somehow.  The rest of the cast was wisely chosen and the entire production kept me glued to my chair.  Bravo.",1388707200,,223,4.666666666666667
1748644,1,B00006FHZE,"Horrible acting; I couldn't get beyond the silly, over-acted expressions to concentrate on the story. Extremely predictable. Slow moving. Simply watching stupid facial expressions with a shallow story line gets old.",1388620800,,215,5.967741935483871
1748645,1,B00006FHZE,"I have to start by saying I'm not going to compare this to Downton Abbey. First of all, that's nonsense. Second of all, even Downton Abbey has some faults but Forsyte Saga suffers from one of the biggest, it manages to come up a slew of characters you don't even care about. How is that possible? I mean is it me or should a story have at least someone to root for. The Forsyte Saga has none of that. It's a story about the most selfish, reprehensible and downright boring people that has even been written. I have never read any of the ""Forsyte Saga"" books and after watching this nonsense, I probably never will. I mean, the supposed heroine, Irene (pronouced Irini...how pretentious), comes across as a sullen, weak, whiny, simpering pain in the ass who doesn't and make the most of her marriage. It looks like she went into the marriage looking and hoping for it to fail. Soames may be a cold, possessive man and comes across as the villian and he goes way too far with forcing himself on her but she's no heroine here. Besides, she's just not ALL that beautiful as you hear way too many times in the film. Enough already! She's built like a boy and doesn't have much of a personality.  You would think a character that is supposed to draw people would at the very least have some charisma and charm? Another thing, the love affair between Irene and Bosinney just doesn't work and hardly steams up the screen. Seeing them together, particularly in the dance scene, is just blah. I mean to me, they look like brother and sister...creepy! I actually felt bad for Soames when these two came strolling in holding hands and taking the floor. How despicable? They couldn't even be discreet after all. What a repulsive couple! The Bosinney character is not all at attractive either and just sits around and stares and glares at everyone. What's with that? Yuck!  After watching this drivel, I guess I can scratch ""The Forsyte Saga"" collection off my ""books to read"" list.",1388534400,7,1968,4.572237960339943
1748646,4,B00006FHZE,"Similar in time period to Downton Abbey, The Forsyte Saga follows generations of Forsytes through social change with a family feud as the underlying drama.  I got a little weary of it about midway through season 1, but stuck with it because some of the characters (Irene & young Jolyon) were compelling.  Glad I saw both seasons, although the ending isn't a ""happily ever after"" one.",1388275200,,383,4.787878787878788

1748670,4,B00006FHZE,I found that I liked the story better after watching it the second time.  There are so many deeply flawed characters.

It is funny that my sympathies with the characters completely switched this time. When a woman marries for money, she should live up to her bargain.  It is the development of the characters and the strength of the actors that pull me in so that I even care to take a position. Excellent!",1387065600,,408,4.589041095890411

1748759,1,B00006FHZE,"Melodramatic trash.  Forsyte Saga has no character you can admire; they are all disappointing.  I could not find one character with whom I could identify.  It is like the creators of the series were incapable of of realizing what people were actually like in the early 20th century, so they dressed up modern characters in period clothes and told them to act naturally.  Do not waste your time with this show.  Downton Abbey and Foyle's War are far superior.",1384300800,4,458,4.746835443037975

1748761,4,B00006FHZE,"Good Soap opera a la English style. Two families that have a feud which extends for a long period of time (it continues in Season 2) with a lot of good drama. It reminded me of Romeo and Juliet but it's much more than that. There is good acting, good dialogue, it's interesting and engaging. We are fans of BBC for its wholesomeness and just great book to script series. This one has a more serious tone, it's more explicit in it's content but I would rate it PG13. It's definitely worth watching and learning about human nature, good and evil, love and hate and forgiveness.",1384128000,,575,4.433962264150943

Just sadness all the way through. Got to where I couldn't stand the sight of Soames, he reminded me of a frowning fish. (sorry, Soames).  And I agree that Irene was not beautiful, and very cold.

I now see it as a brilliant adaptation of the author's messages, themes, and intentions for writing his long revered novel. The main character, Soames Forsyte was a difficult read for me.  The actor appeared genuinely kind, upstanding and winsome, but his darker interior was so subtly done that it was hard for me to pick up on, until viewing it a second time through.  I like to think of this saga as a lack of ""foresight"" by all the main characters caught in this epic change of times from Victorian Era to modern day.

This series focuses more on the high society women of their time, and how so many of these arranged marriages turned out.  I liked it because the show illustrated the point that it was not only poor women who had problems, society women had problems too!  Often, they were used like barter to help ease the financial situation of their families.  So glad I was not around in this time period!!",1378684800,,567,4.509803921568627

And I was so impressed, delighted--I can't think of the word--well, in some way dazzled by each them, that I had to watch the first season again. The main characters seem to me to be beautifully cast: Gina McKee as Irene Heron, the lovely, penniless young womn Soames yearns to possess, and Damien Lewis as Soames Forsyte the young barrister in an upper middle class family of barristers. Irene actually IS as Soames sees her: beautiful, lithe, talented, but she is so much more that Soames cannot see--blindness, acquisitiveness: these are his tragic flaws.

To watch Soames become so bitter and then - well I won't ruin that part.  I really enjoyed this well written masterpiece.  The acting flawless although I think Irinee's role was miscast - watch it and you will see - I am still looking for this great beauty.  The actress did a fine job in projecting coldness and detachment and then great empathy. It was fun to watch the world change over the course of this great saga - My grandma was born in 1900 in Ireland and I can definitely see some of her here.

When it arrived I watched it on my computer and was extremely disappointed as it DOES NOT contain all the episodes of Series 1. First of all there are only 3 DVDs. Two episodes per DVD, therefore, only 6 episodes. They compact the story and completely skip over scenes and jump into the future. So many scenes are missing. Such as when Irene goes to visit old Jolyon at the house on Robin Hill, the scenes where old Jolyon dies and remembers Irene in his will. All the episodes where Irene is living abroad, and Soames is stalking her, etc. This is very deceptive on the part of Amazon as this is represented as if it is the ""Series 1"".

The detail of the costumes and the sets are gorgeous, giving the viewer a peep into the past, like being in a time machine. It is interesting to see the social customs of the day in the interactions between men and women as well as between the classes.  Damian Lewis, recently of Homeland fame, plays the role of Soames Forsythe, one of the principal characters.  The acting is so real, I totally forget myself and am transported into that era.

I've always been torn regarding Ireene.  One minutes almost in tears for her the next, angry and frustrated at her.  Soames is from my point of view the product of his upbringing and he surpresses his emotions because he cannot handle them.

1749213,4,B00006FHZE,"Very beautifully done but woefully miscast ""re-imagining"" of the Forsyte Saga.  I agree with the above analyses emphatically. The earlier series was 5 - 5.5 stars. Taken on it's own, this version is wholly satisfying, This, in comparison, lacks somewhat.  For example, the voluptuous blonde enchantress Irene is played by a somewhat buck-toothed actress with raven tresses. (I'm watching, thinking, 'OMG, this is the BBC!! Couldn't they just have slapped a wig on her???') But if you weren't spoiled by the splendid 60's version, such instances of being simply underwhelmed will not trouble one as much.
I simply posted to say, if you love the characters - or even one character - do yourself a favor and read the books by John Galsworthy. They are masterworks of detail and characterization.",1360972800,,792,5.084615384615384

1749283,5,B00006FHZE,"I heartily recommend the Forsyte Saga. This epic follows the lives and loves of Soames & Irene Forsyte. Soames obsession with Irene begins before she's forced to marry him and never stops. His scheming, obsession, hatred, insane jealously just propels and repels Irene Forsyte through the whole story. I couldn't stop watching. Soames obsession poisons his relationship with Irene, his relationship with his second wife and his child and grandchildren. I was just as obsessed with watching the next episode. It is one of the best series I have watched and I actually liked it better than Downton Abbey. If you like period dramas this film fits the bill.",1358985600,3,653,5.0
1749284,4,B00006FHZE,"I confess I have yet to read Galsworthy's novels but I could not resist watching this series especially since it was available as a free download for Amazon Prime members. The story begins in the 1880s and follows the trials and tribulations of a large upper middle class Victorian family by the name of Forsyte. The main story revolves around Soames Forsyte (Damian Lewis), a successful London solicitor whose strait-laced manner and stiff upper lip make him a bit socially awkward. He sees a beautiful young woman one night at the opera while visiting Bournemouth on business. The young lady in question, a Ms. Irene Heren (Gina McKee), has recently lost her faher, and has been left at the mercy of a less than benign stepmother who is determined to marry her charge off to a rich man. Soames immediately falls in love with Irene and pursues her relentlessly only to be rebuffed again and again as Irene is determined to marry only for love. It is only out of sheer desperation that she finally capitulates and becomes Soames' wife, a union that leaves both of them disappointed and unhappy.

There are other characters that round off this production such as Old Jolyon who is portrayed as a wise old man whose son, Young Jolyon leaves his wife and young daughter to run off with the beautiful governess. This may seem sordid but it is only so on the surface as Young Jolyon's marriage was not one based on love and he does find true love with Helene, the governess. There's Soames' sister, Winifred (Amanda Root of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>) whose love marriage to a womanizer and gaming man brings her a load of grief.

Initially, I found Gina McKee to be rather an odd choice as the beautiful, much fancied woman, Irene because frankly speaking she did not seem all that beautiful, but I guess this is a matter of perspective. At the beginning of the series, she seemed too cold and indifferent and I could not fathom why so many men found her irresistible. Later on though, McKee gets into the role and embraces it with such emotion that I found her performance to be credible and natural. Her soft modulated tones are such a pleasure to hear.

I hope to read the novels and compare this production with the books, though from the reviews it appears that the older adaptation might be judged superior. I shall have to look that adaptation up too. For now, I found this new adaptation to be visually pleasing with compelling performances by the cast and look forward to the second part.",1358640000,,2608,4.922727272727273

(the one exception being Gina McKee, a miscast I'm afraid, tho I think I'm not alone in that assessment); hats off to Galsworthy for such a variety of well-developed, memorable characters and a masterpiece of a narrative/examination of social developments/psychological insight (despite his critics' undervaluation of him and the overshadowing by some other authors, his readers have enduringly appreciated him). Episode Four is my favorite!  I located the beautiful, elegaic poem Young Jolyon reads at Old Jolyon's funeral - it's (not surprisingly) by Shakespeare!

1749290,4,B00006FHZE,"Since I'm in the midst of writing my own English saga of sorts, I usually get sucked into these DVD sets for hours on end drowning myself in period English dramas.  The Forsyte Saga makes it to the top of my list as an enjoyable treat of English life.  I'm often fascinated over how the rich lived in the Victorian age.  My English family made bricks; while families like these lived lives of luxury filled with all sorts of soap opera antics.

As far as the characters, the central focus of Soames and Irene was interesting.  Frankly, my heart went out to the proper, stout Englishman who adored a woman, wanted to be loved in return, and desired children.  His passion, of course, borders on obsession, but you can't help but feel sorry for the poor man who never found a woman to love him.

As far as Irene, I felt absolutely no sympathy for that woman whatsoever.  Perhaps my heart was a cold as the one she portrayed of stone with little remorse over the hurt she caused others in her life.  She was an interesting character who grated upon me throughout the series, which good characters are supposed to do!

As far as the remaining hours, they were an interesting treat of English life and the gorgeous dresses and costumes.  No matter what English movie I watch, the birds are always chirping in the background.  Only problem I did have was the period jump in years that went from five, six, twelve and not one gray hair made it on anyone's head!  They all seemed to be ageless.  A little more realism in that arena would have been better. Otherwise enjoyable.  Not sure when I'll see the second half of the saga and continue the story.",1323302400,,1644,4.469798657718121
1749291,5,B00006FHZE,"The actors were great and the story was engaging, and I've rented this series twice because I loved it so much! So I almost bought Forsyte Saga about a year ago for Christmas when I read the negative reviews of both the 1st and 2nd seasons that praised the 1969 version instead. Rather than buying the new version, I decided to rent the 1969 adaptation.
Let me just say that (and this is my personal experience, can't help it), that I was able to sit through only the first few episodes, before I decided to wrap up the disks that I was renting and put them straight into the mail box to send them back to N.....x. I found it excruciatingly boring. I also want to add that I am a person who loves and appreciates all sorts of movies; mostly slow ones that deal with the psyche of people, that delve into human nature, period pieces, independent productions, movies from different parts of the globe, so me craving action, shooting, fast paced scenes, etc. was not the problem. The fact that the older version of FS was made in 1969 was also not the problem, because I love older movies as well, such as Upstairs Downstairs (which I actually own).

I do not want to offend anyone, we all have different tastes, all I'm saying; don't let the negative reviews put you off the new version of the series, give this one a chance too, it is fantastic! This year I am buying them for Christmas.

The one thing that I agree on is that, in the new version of FS, Irene does not look like the exquisite beauty that she is suppose to be according to the book. However, she is attractive enough for the part and doing an excellent job in portraying her character!",1322092800,3,1650,4.371335504885994
1749292,3,B00006FHZE,Great costumes and lavish sets - this has all the splendor that the 1967 piece should have had - but lacking the development of complex characters that the older version elegantly portrayed.

1749312,5,B00006FHZE,"I felt the later series were a little bit of a disappointment after season one. This was our first introduction to a set of marvellous characters in interesting times.

The acting was impeccable and ITV did a great job of bringing such a great set of books to the screen.

Damian Lewis gets the acting honours for this show, however I was a little disappointed with Ioan Gruffudd's performance. But I suppose you can't have it all.",1307404800,,431,4.584415584415584
1749313,4,B00006FHZE,"The Forsyte clan would at once seem to be otherworldly with their Victorian English clothes and manners.  But when you look deeper all the familiar foils are there - sibling rivalry, black sheep and ne'er do wells that haunt every family.  Told at the turn of the century when people were marrying for money first and love second - it twists around the central character of Soames.  He's played amazingly by Damian Lewis, as a misunderstood man who loves beauty but can only own it rather than experience it.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Soames would have no redeeming qualities, but Lewis makes him human - odd with strange quirks and tics, but someone who wants to get love and just can't.  His frustration makes him mean and controlling, but for the want of someone, anyone who will show him some affection.

I never read the books, but I found Irene to be a cold, vixen who made a choice to marry for money and then took up with every man who crossed her path - except her husband.  That had to annoy him - but nothing on the order of excusing the brutal marital rape scene depicted.  Soames is supposed to be unlikeable, but I found myself understanding, even empathizing with him.

Their dysfunctional family includes the elder Forsyte brothers always in competition; the lecherous gambler - Darty and his wife Winnifred (Soames' sister) who put up with his debauchery - to a point; the two judgmental unmarried aunts; George who never seems to do much, but is always there; the black sheep (Joylon) who betrays his vows to follow his heart and some how still ends up with Irene (as does virtually every other man in the story).

The other central character is June who is an abandoned child, then an abandoned woman (betrayed by Bossiny and Irene) and who must ultimately accept the woman who stole her lover as family (again).  She for some reason hates Soames, but forgives everyone else everything.  June I find a bit false in that she never seems to arrive at her betrayal being a function of both Irene and Phil, but rather lumps all wrongs onto Soames - he's a convenient target and easy to dislike.

This is high drama, soap opera, lovers, trysts, betrayals, double crosses and in the end I return to Soames who must chose between his wife and the child he so desperately wants but can't seem to get in a heart wrenching decision - made dispassionately in classic Soames fashion.  It's as if he feels the emotions, but lacks the tools to express them - it all comes out as anger.  But there are moments...like when he lies to his father about having a son to give the dying man his last wish; or having to chose between his wife and child; or having to leave the wife and new born to go to his father's death bed.  He bears it stoically, but could you wipe away the steam and see underneath that glass - oh, what a roiling pot of trouble you'd find.  And the final scene of Soames and the baby took me back to the story his mother told about him smothering that kitten with too much love.  It's as if he lacks the ability to modulate his emotion - you get it all at once or none at all.

The production's British, so naturally it's austere, understated, beautifully costumed and the sets are marvelous.  I, for one, would love to live at Robin Hill and having seen this I know now I must read the books from whence it sprang.  Lovely production and well worth the cost for the DVDs.",1303776000,12,3400,4.451612903225806
1749314,3,B00006FHZE,"If I hadn't read the books and seen the original TV production, I wouldn't have been surprised to learn that Gina McKee's Irene's final and proper destination was a convent. Every time she and Bossiney made love I thought, She must be thinking of God (and England).  She appeared always to be feeling some exquisite pain and listening to the music of the spheres. Whatever joy and happiness she did manage to express seemed to be of the type you'd feel before you knew you were going to die (or enter the convent). Beneath their proper exteriors Winifred, June or even Ma Soames seemed more likely candidates to succumb to good old earthy passion.  And as another reviewer noted it was actually an accepted practice for well bred spouses to have separate bedrooms. In Downton Abbey, another recent series covering nearly the same period, the Lord and Lady put in an effort to hide the fact that he came to her room--for the sake of the servants (who knew everything anyway).

In a story that is largely driven by dramatics arising from the hidden sexual behavior of the Victorians, it seems vital to get the sex part right--and I was never convinced; of any longing, lust, or action between the sheets.  Helene, the governess Young Jolyon couldn't resist, seemed so goofy-loopy I couldn't imagine her in an adult sexual relationship.  Ditto for Fleur.  Now Winifred and Annette, I think they had some blood in their veins. And Old Jolyon, what a great guy. The presence of Corin Redgrave made the series for me and I lost interest when he died. You knew he still wanted it (what a longing look he got in his eyes) and, actually, he was the only one I could really imagine warming up Irene's chilly knickers. In a story about social strictures and sexual repression, we have to believe in the sexual desire that's threatening to break through. They managed to do this better somehow in the 1967 version--as ""stiff"" as it was--just as the original Brideshead Revisited series had so much more true feeling than the awful movie released in 2008.  Style without substance is never rewarding.",1300665600,,2087,4.732782369146006

1749316,5,B00006FHZE,"I actually watched this whole thing online, but I plan on buying this series soon and sharing it with my fellow period drama/romance fans. I fell in love with the character of Young Jolyon right away - I suppose it helps that I'm a big fan of Rupert Graves. He is so handsome and a fantastic actor. I had just finished watching The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and I was ready to watch more of Graves ASAP. He is my favorite character. I love all the characters, even Soames when he's horrible to Irene. Damian Lewis played Soames wonderfully - right down to the way he walked.  His character disgusted me often times, but there is something about Soames that made me secretly like him. I kept hoping that he would change for the better and become a better person at the end. (I wish Lewis' Life series hadn't been cancelled. I thought it was great, and Damian Lewis deserved a second season at least.)

I was so sad when series 2 ended. The ending was very satisfying and well done, and I cried happy tears...I was just sad it was all over. I really felt the conflicting emotions of the two sides of the family through each generation, and I laughed and cried with both sides of the Forsyte family.

Aside from the story, the setting and the costumes were beautiful, but I didn't much care for the later years in series 2 because the costumes were less elaborate although true to the time period. I'm not a fan of the clothing from the early 1900s...flapper dresses and hair adornments, as beautiful as they are, are just not as fun and flattering in my opinion for the women. At least the men always looked wonderful through the whole of series 1 and 2.

If he had asked, who's the ugly vampire w/buck teeth, then I might have thought that the miniseries had some integrity.  How this specimen by the name of Irene, played by Gina McKee, inspired men to risk everything and Soames to commit rape is beyond the imagination.  Damien Lewis, whose work I'm not familiar with, became better as the story progressed but he had the most irritating habit of breathing through his mouth, which means that it was always partially open.  What an unattractive couple!

The story itself is predictable; people love those that they shouldn't, ignore those that they should, they die young except for the two really old Forstyes and what matters most in life is what you possess and who observes you while you possess it.

I gave it two stars because it was visually appealing but had it lacked that, no stars would've been too good for it.  And to think that I have Series 2 to look forward to.  Yay.",1255824000,8,1088,4.538461538461538
1749368,5,B00006FHZE,"The Forsytes are a nouveau riche London family, a generation or so removed from their yeoman roots, who by the 1870s are prospering nicely through their real estate and banking interests.  Soames Forsyte, the up and coming leader of the younger generation, needs a wife.  His cousin Young Jolyon Forsyte is already married, but he has fallen in love with his daughter's governess and a scandal is about to ensue.

Soames and Jolyon are the two main Forsytes in this series.  Soames is ""a man of property"" who knows what he wants and intends to keep what he has. He falls in love with the beautiful Irene Herron, a poor girl who has no option but to marry a wealthy husband, even though she doesn't love or even like him very much.  Jolyon leaves his wife and settles down with the governess, enduring ostracism by the other Forsytes for many years. Eventually the lives of these two branches of the Forsytes collide, not once but repeatedly, with Irene as one of the catalysts.

The producers of this series must have been very brave indeed to film it in the wake of its earlier and highly esteemed predecessor from the 1960s.  This series is much shorter and perforce must leave out some of the subplots and lesser characters.  But its a very beautifully done production, filled with the most perfect of English summer days and with some of the finest actors of our time, particularly Rupert Graves and Gina McKee.",1251504000,4,1415,4.6546184738955825
1749369,3,B00006FHZE,"What's everyone getting so excited about?  This is nothing more than a soap opera where everybody dresses in Victorian clothes.  And unlike, say, Austen or Bronte, there's nothing deeper here:  just a whole bunch of adultery.  In Galsworthy's mind, there is apparently no such thing as love flourishing when it is permitted to do so:  to him, the only real love is forbidden love.

One of the things I found infuriating was that the swelling violin music was implying that you're supposed to be sympathizing with the screwball adulteress, Irene, whereas when I was watching it, I was siding with the supposedly evil Soames the whole time.  From time to time he behaved dishonorably, I agree, but I felt that he was far more sinned against than sinning, and that he was the film's true hero.

Alas!  The filmmakers didn't seem to agree and kept trying to get me to hate him, which rubbed me the wrong way through the film's length.

Granted, I haven't watched very much of the original and admit to being attracted to the superficial qualities of this production--gorgeous shooting locations, incredible wardrobes, and minute attention to historical detail--but I also find the acting first-rate.  Damien Lewis creates a Soames with so much depth and complexity that he becomes more intriguing with each viewing.  I disagree with people who pan Gina McKee--there are elements of her performance which are angular and withdrawn, but it's part of how she plays the character.  She evolves with the show, and the more distance she puts between herself and her marriage to Soames, the more beautiful and self-assured she becomes.  Also, the soundtrack by Geoffrey Burgon (Brideshead Revisited) is great and only enhances the atmosphere of this truly lavish production.",1248912000,4,909,5.328671328671328
1749371,5,B00006FHZE,"Having given up on trying to watch most cable television (most of the programs are of little merit or interest, and the few that are are riddled with commericals every seven minutes) I first came across this set while browsing in the local library. I never read Galworthy in college (though now I wish I had, though, sad to say, even if it had been assigned I probably would have relied on Cliff Notes.) However, I chose this set to watch inasmuch as I have written and had published several novels taking place during this period (Lily Queen, Alienation of Affection, among others, which have been well received), and thought it high time I read more of the authors who wrote of this period. I thought this set was extraordinary good, but having read the sixty or so reviews of it (many of which compared it unfavorably to the original 1967 series), I immediately got ahold of the 1967 version so I could decide for myself. Reminding myself of a quote from one of Galsworthy's characters (""comparisons are odious), I was equally impressed by the 1967 version and can understand completely how it grasped the imagination of Britain at the time, and can only imagine how each Saturday night was one of great anticipation. Both versions are outstanding in their own way, and I surely would not have been interested in watching the second version were it merely a carbon copy of the first. Nyrene's beauty in the first was as spectacular as Galworthy would have wished had he cast it, though I am convinced he would have liked Gina's character just as well in a different way. I must disagree with those who insist that only a ""classic"" beauty would have fit Galworthy's vision. There are so many vacuous beauties who might fit a narrow requirement of beauty, but in my experience the woman who inspire the deepest admiration and adoration are those who go beyond (Cleopatra comes to mind, who,  though not an exceptional classic beauty,inspired the deepest pasions of two of history's greatest figures). In many ways, Gina, whose beauty is concededly breathtaking,  is absolutely perfect in every other way as well, though admittedly in a different way from Nyene, who is also ""perfect"" in the context of the earlier production. Though I confess to being more of a sucker for the rich production values (particualry the street scenes) in the second version, the dialogue and character development in both versions overshadow completely the production values. This is quite the reverse of most current productions in both film and TV, in which a film is (apparently) far more valued for its production values--special effects, chase scenes, etc.--than for its plot or character development. I enjoyed both of these versions in their own right, including the characterizations of Soammes in both.

1749372,5,B00006FHZE,"I'll admit I knew nothing about The Forsyte Saga and only started watching since I'm a big fan of Damian Lewis from the NBC series Life and Life had just ended for the season so I was ""jonzing"" for some Damian Lewis big-time.

Damian Lewis plays the harsh, cold & obsessive Soames Forsyte.  It was pretty difficult to watch him play such a hateful character and still try to maintain a crush on him but I guess that goes to show what a great actor he is.  His portrayal of Soames was deliciously wicked.

I also liked the actress who played his wife Irene. (Pronounced: Irene-y) She's no typical tanned American beauty but she has that almost fragile-ethereal presence & slightly ""handsome"" features where you look classy with or without make-up.  But when she put that Paris hat on near the end, I hated to admit that she reminded me a bit of the witch on the bicycle in the Wizard of Oz.

But my favorite character was the young Jolyon played by Rupert Graves.  He was an easy character to like as was the old Jolyon.
Actually, there were no characters in the story that I did not enjoy.
I was planning to watch an episode per night but found myself finishing several per night and was looking forward to getting home the next day so I could watch the next.

I don't doubt McKee's acting ability, but she was a mistake for this role.  Her stone coolness was a bit too cold.  Her interpretation of Irene is not the sort of woman that would cause this kind of ""enchantment"" of so many members of this family.  I just don't believe it.  I didn't believe passion at all, and she had three different chances to try to prove it to me.  I don't like to judge anything until I've finished it, but I had to grit my teeth any time Irene was on screen.

1749431,5,B00006FHZE,"""The Forsyte Saga"" takes us back to another time -- when soap operas were dressed up in lace, gilt, marble and love threatened by society's dictates.

This sprawling, sumptuous miniseries, adapted from John Galsworthy's novels, introduces viewers to the Forsyte family, who never change and uphold themselves with rigid propriety. And the first season of it is a wonderfully dramatic tale of love, possession, and a man's obsession with his unattainable wife.

As the story opens, Young Jolyon (Rupert Graves) realizes that he is in love with the governess, and leaves his wife to begin a new life with his beloved. The Forsyte family shuts him out, more angered by his sin against society than his leaving his wife. (Lovely people)

Four years later, Soames Forsyte (Damian Lewis) catches a glimpse of the beautiful Irene Heron (Gina McKee) at a concert, and is instantly smitten. Irene rejects him, but is trapped by lack of money. Eventually she concedes -- if he promises to let her be free if the marriage fails.

But she doesn't come to love him, although he still tries to get her affection. Finally he commissions his niece's fiancee, Bosinney (Ioan Gruffudd), to build a country palace for Irene. But then Irene and Bosinney fall passionately in love, and the enraged Soames strikes back at them -- with shocking, then tragic results.

Ten more years pass. Soames wants to remarry a pretty young French girl, but is still legally married to Irene. He demands that she name a recent lover, so he can get a divorce -- but then he starts obsessively stalking his wife, trying to win her back. Instead, he drives her into the arms of the grieving Young Jolyon...

Love, sex, violence, death, war, gambling, scandal, babies and seething resentment -- all the ingredients of a juicy drama. And despite the period clothing, this is a very juicy miniseries, as well as being mostly faithful to Galsworthy's sprawling novels, and very prettily made.

In fact, it juggles the various storylines -- Dartie's scandals, Holly and Val falling in love, Irene's affair -- with remarkable flair. And as Galsworthy did, it explores how women were treated (""Miss Heron, will you be mine?"" ""I will MARRY you, Mr Forsyte""), forgiveness, and how a scandal only affects you if you allow it to. The writing is impeccable.

And it takes place in magnificent period sets. Sure, they're too ornate for the sensible Forsytes, but they are gorgeous -- from the more modern house by Bosinney, to the stately, ornate homes in London. The main flaw is that it slows down substantially in the final third, and some threads are left hanging for the second season.

And the cast is stunning. Rather than making Soames sympathetic, Lewis makes him UNDERSTANDABLE -- he's despicable, but the audience can see how narrow-minded and desperate he is. McKee is quietly enigmatic, and Graves is passionate and lovable. They're backed by equally good performances by Gruffudd, Corin Redgrave as the family patriarch, and Gillian Kearney as lonely June.

""The Forsyte Saga's"" first season is a dramatic, intense miniseries, though it slows down a great deal at the end. In all, a spellbinding look at a family that thinks way too much of itself.",1162771200,18,3210,4.9168207024029575

Soames and Irene - a match made in heaven and hell.  Often, we forget that women in that time were mere possessions - when the men in their life were gone - they had to resort to ""selling"" themselves in order to survive.  Soames knows he isn't a fancy catch - but he has money and class - and that counts for something.  He desperately wants Irene and finally wins her.  But he isn't much in the emotion department and she looks elsewhere to satisfy this need.  Thus, the story takes off  and all the characters go forward in their flaws and various storylines.

The interiors of this production are in one word - fabulous.  It makes the story even more enjoyable.  Kudos to the art department.

Even after Soames and Irene have their storyline - the children pick up with their turmoils.  One of the editorial reviewers described the story as ""nothing if not superior soap opera"".  I know lots of people get turned off when they hear the words ""soap opera.""  I give you ""The Sopranos""  - the biggest soap opera in recent years.

I did not see the old version of this series and knew nothing about the series before viewing, so I did not have the disappointment that some reviewers felt, either because the series was not as good as the old one or not as good as the books. Onscreen things are always a disappointment for those that have read the books. And rarely remakes make people that saw the originals happy. But for me, as I approached this with a beginners mind without any previous experience of this material, I was riveted by it.

I thought the actress playing Irene was masterful. She oozed intrigue, coldness and an angelic quality all at the same time. She floated around with a refinement that made her stand out in a crowd, even if her looks might not have been perfect.

The character of Solmes was also greatly depicted. I felt compassion for this man and hated him at the same time. The actor's port rail of an abusive because too controlling in his love type husband was realistic in my experience. I have come across a man of this kind. The raging, the subtle shaking, the twitching and the facial expressions were priceless here. I disagree with those that say his performance was monotone. Anything but.

The costuming and the settings were also great. Some people said they looked too modern. I disagree. Modern UK decorating is very inspired to the Victorian era. I lived in the UK for 15 years and the sets looked beautiful and realistic to me.

And last but not least the story- how wonderful. It is rare to find a story that involves you so much that you are eagerly anticipating the next episode, as each installment whisks you away into another world filled with interesting characters dealing with love, passion, integrity, struggling to remain true to themselves in a very restricting society.

Soames Forsyte is a powerful man, a major player in the business life of the City of London at the high point of Empire. Damien Lewis plays him as Uriah Heap;a jumped up clerk decked who would not have made it to square one in the circles Soames moved in.

Irene, Galsworthy's ethereal presence spinning her web, half spider, half enchantress, is portrayed by Gina McKee with all the grace of a Catherine Cookson heroine, clogs and all, more Olive Oyle than gazelle. A week at Lucy Clayton's would not have gone amiss.

This said, the 2000 version is far and away superior to the 69 version. The performances here are vastly more nuanced and subtle, especially Damien Lewis as Soams. His predecessor was not only too old for the role but I find his performance very self-conciouse and one note. As for the huge uproar over the casting of Irene, I expected to be bowled over by the original, I was not. Here again a very stagey and also vacant performance. Gina McKee is an Irene who attracts not only with her grace and beauty.  She is attractive because of her sensitvity her insight and her unwilingness to bow to Victorian social standards. The very things that attract Soams to Irene are the things that make it impossible for their marriage to work.

Trust me you are talking to a guy that falls asleep in most of today's movie theaters after the first half hour so for me to hang in there for a full 15 hourse makes this and absolute MUST recommendation to purchase for your DVD collection....
Oddy enough, I do however think that women from ages 19 and up will gobble up the love stories of the Forsythe saga while the men however MUST be at least 35 years old or older.

1749471,4,B00006FHZE,"In 1969 as a callow youth I was mesmerized by a black and white flicerking image on our 17 inch television screen. It was, of course, the blockbuster British series of The Forsyte Saga by Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy.
  Much has changed in my life and the world since that distant Sunday when I tuned in to my local Natiional Education Television station (as PBS was known of in that time).
  I have read all the books in the Forsyte Saga and find the writing somewhat old fashioned in that Galsworthy relies on strict narrative without stream of consciousness or other more innovative techniques. Soames mellows in both the books and both the tv series.  The best book and the best part of the series is the ""Man of Property"" part in which we are introduced to the
Philistine Forsytes in the 1970s when the British Empire reigned supreme.
  The acting in the new version is excellent. Gina McKee is not your usual beauty but her acting and cold sophistication are a wonder to behold. Damian Lewis is superb as Soames. The supporting cast is excellent.
  The camera angles are interesting with high shots sometimes giving one a panoramic view of the scenes; costuming and furnishing on the sets are accurate to the time period involved.
  Many people will find the action snail like and grow bored with this nineteenth century soap but those who stick with the proceedings will enjoy the series.
  In Simon Montefiore's new biography of Stalin I learned that the Russian dictator considered the old Greer Garson movie ""That
Forsyte Woman"" to be his favorite movie! There is no accounting for what type of person will enjoy the Forsytes!

1749472,3,B00006FHZE,"I viewed the entire series on PBS and was hoping that this new version would be as good as the original 1969 BBC version. Unfortunately,it falls far below that landmark series. First,  almost none of the actors are right for their roles. Damian Lewis as Soames has only one dimension:mean. Soames should be multi-faceted, played to perfection by the great Eric Porter in the original series. As Young Jolyon,Rupert Graves is TOO young,too cruel in the last series,and misses completely the irony of this pivotal character. The marvelous Kenneth More had this part pegged in the original. Gina McKee is a fine actress,but she is NOT Irene. Her performance is simply that of a completely langorous wimp. Irene's passive yet resolute spirit was played unforgettably by the wonderful Nyree Dawn Porter in the original. And finally,the actress who played Fleur was completely unbelievable,playing this role as rather dull and petulant, totally self centered. Fleur is a character of quicksilver,moody but bright,selfish but kind. The superb Susan Hampshire played this role to perfection in the original. The worst problem,however,was the adaptation. Complete scenes that were never in the books were created out of whole cloth,ruining the cohesiveness of the story. Other scenes were changed with ludicrous results. For this version,3 stars for effort. Not very good. Avoid it. Get the 1969 original version while it is still available.",1078876800,4,1432,5.308370044052864
1749473,1,B00006FHZE,"I own the original black and white series, originally broadcast in 1969, and thus appreciate the nuanced, memorable performances, superb casting, and attention to John Galsworthy's aims. I watched this new series and have already forgotten many of the principle roles/actors: Fleur? Jon? Who can forget Susan Hampshire's dynamic, forceful, charming and manipulative Fleur? Today I cannot remember the new Fleur, nor Jon. Indeed, I do not remember many of the actors in this new series; utterly undistinguished. Whenever I pick up the books, as I often do, I shudder if images of this series enter my imagination. This heavy, plodding, and dull series does Galsworthy a disservice.

What of Eric Porter's complex and tortured Soames? Damian Lewis, otherwise an excellent actor, is given little to do outside of look angry or evil. Or the late Nyree Dawn Porter? This flat, awkward Irene, so terribly miscast, with the wrong colouring, lacks the ethereal, delicate, blonde haired, dark eyed beauty of Galworthy's vision (based on his wife Ada); she is no match for the late Nyree Dawn Porter. Gina McKee is also far too old, being twelve years older than the handsome Ioan Gruffud (Philip Bosinney), ten years older than Damian Lewis (Soames Forsyte), and two years older than Rupert Graves (young Jolyon). No wonder she had no chemistry with any of the leads; watching her with Gruffud was disconcertingly unpleasant. Vaguely incestuous due to the age disparity. Irene, in Galsworthy's books, was sixteen years younger than young Jolyon, eight years younger than Soames, and perhaps close in age to Philip Bosinney.

The original series took great pains to faithfully recreate Galsworthy's masterpiece. Not perfectly - costumes, sets, hairstyles are a little too true to late nineteen sixties fashion. And sections do lag. Thankfully, though, the actors reflected the age differences between the characters. Most of all, there is simply no comparison in terms of script and acting ability. All the actors aged appropriately, both in terms of appearance and character: Irene grew in dignity as she aged, and Soames showed the effects of suffering on his face - even as he doted upon his beloved daughter. The old series succeeded at casting actors who truly embodied the essence of Galsworthy's social satire: Bosinney, for example, was not traditionally handsome, but eccentric, artistic, and utterly foreign - as was Irene. Galsworthy, at the heart of his masterpiece, wished to thoroughly explore the dichotomy between Victorian aquisitiveness, discipline, and materialism with freedom, art, beauty and irrational emotion.

Here, however, all is rushed at breakneck speed, compressed almost beyond recognition.

Of course it is difficult to compress such a massive work into a small format; the original series, running at 26 hours, allowed for greater - and more demanding - character development. So why did the writers of this new version add explicit, anachronistic scenes that detract from the viewing experience? Why add so much modern dialogue? Irene practicing birth control? Slapping June? Out of character, socially inappropriate, not reflective of either the book or the age. The sets were, for the most part, quite spectacular (as opposed to the costumes, which appeared cheap), but this Robin Hill did not fit the architecture of the period, bearing a too close resemblance to a Frank Lloyd Wright masterwork. Certainly not something from pre Arts and Crafts England.

I was bitterly disappointed in this version, despite eager anticipation. What a waste of time. Sloppy.",1074988800,22,3585,5.293497363796134

1749517,4,B00006FHZE,"Gine McKee's being miscast as Irene Heron Forsyte is the greatest puzzle of this otherwise superb television adaption revisiting of Galsworthy's masterpiece of a wealthy family making the transition from the Victorian to the modern era. Although she looks splendidly chic and soigne in her costumes as Soames's trophy wife (she seems at times consciously to evoke Sargent's ""Madame X""), she looks utterly unconvincing in her early scenes as a young unmarried girl who would capture Soames's attentions despite her relative poverty. Moreover, though she tries her best, she's just not up to the demands of the role, which requires her to be enigmatic (which she can manage) but also incredibly sympathetic (which she cannot).
Otherwise this revisitation of the BBC miniseries which launched ""Masterpiece Theatre"" in 1969 is superb from beginning to end. The writers, Stephen Mallatratt and jan McVerry, did magnificent work in expanding Galsworthy's text, adding beautifully done scenes (such as Young Jolyon's heartbreaking leavetaking of his unloved first wife, Frances) that are only background material in the original source material. The extremely gifted actor Damian Lewis serves as the linchpin figure of the cast as the ""man of property"" Soames Fosyte, baffled by his violent passion for Irene and her refusal to reciprocate his affections, but the entire magnificent cast is a kind of ""who's who"" of BBC productions from years past, adding to the sense of accumulated history in the material. Special mention should be made of Joanna David (from the late Seventies adaptation of REBECCA) as Irene's pushing yet vulnerable stepmother; Judy Campbell (NANNY) as the formidable senior member of the Forsytes, Aunt Ann; the delightful Wendy Craig (NANNY, BUTTERFLIES) as the gossipy Aunt Juley; Corin Redgrave (PERSUASION) as the complex and dignified Old Jolyon; and especially Amanda Root (PERSUASION) as the increasingly wearied Winifred.

I have of this writing not seen the version done in the late sixties so that does not serve as a comparison, I did see the 1949 version and Greer Garson was far more appealing as Irene. I could not understand how all those men  were just tripping over themselves and each other for her. I found her cold and bloodless and not at all interesting. I don't agree that she needs to be drop dead gorgeous but there must be something there to draw these men in .If she had had warmth or charm ,wit or even an inner radience all of which Garson had it would have been believiable the only way I can explain it is men are sometimes just plain dumb about certain women. On the other hand the most of the cast is outstanding. Damien Lewis own Soames. He gives a multi-layereed proformance he is not always likable but he is often sympathetic his methods may often be questionable his heart is aching to express love but he lacks the knowledge on how to give it freely the few attempts he makes with Irene she rebuffs in cold-blooded fashion while she brazely is seen in public with other men including Soames uncle and cousin. Amanda Root  is as Soames' sister is likable and sympathetic as she deals with a weak-willed husband -this is also a well played if rather absurd character. Root's role of Winifred is also convincing as a caring mother to a daughter and son. Corin Redgrave gives a sensitive proformance as the strong and sensitive elder Jolyon he is openly devoted to his grandaughter June after her father's abandonment and mother's death. June is likable and sympathtic like Winefred especially when you consider that first her fiance then her father falls for Irene. Her fiance Bosinney is the least connvincing in his atteraction to Irene at least you can see were the other three are coming from Soames sees her as his ideal , the elder Jolyon is having a final fling and yonger Jolyon shares a nonconformist bent with Irene. Young Jolyon leaves his cold first wife(June's mom)for the nanny has two kids by her reconnects with his father and daughter . Second wife dies and he falls for Irene. A strong proformance byRupurt Graves we should hate him but we don't ,he dose't want to hurt anyone. overall a compelling mini-series even though Irene is a let down .It is above all the story of a family  and shows how the different branches can be so different from one another and still interactI can relate,I'm sure many of you can too. The final scene is so touching I don't see how anyone could fail to be moved by it. I look forward to the follow up series.",1059696000,6,2895,4.489563567362429
1749519,5,B00006FHZE,"Unlike many of the reviewers here, I thought Gina McKee was excellent in the part of Irene. I noticed that many of those who were unhappy with her performance or her casting were fans either of the original 1969 miniseries or of the Galsworthy novels themselves. I think these people may have been prejudiced against McKee's performance and not given her a fair shot. Having never read the novels nor seen the original black-and-white version of the Forsyte Saga, I came to this production with clear eyes, and I found McKee's Irene to be sensual, enigmatic, richly nuanced, and certainly desirable enough to attract the attention of Soames Forsyte and Philip Bosinny. It's true, she might not be an outgoing, blonde beauty queen, as apparently described in the novels or as cast in the original production--but please note that nowhere in THIS production does it say she's SUPPOSED to be an outgoing, blonde beauty queen. She's simply a woman of a certain intriguing allure, dark-haired, introspective, a bit mysterious. In other words, rather than being an imitation of the original, this production of the Forsyte Saga follows its own rules and has its own internal logic, as any production should. If the director and producers had merely attempted to recreate the novels or the 1969 TV series, they would have ended up with an inferior product. Instead they showed originality and creativity and came up with a production that is unique and, to my eyes at least, totally absorbing and convincing. I think if viewers could approach this production with an open mind they would see that the story of Irene and Soames' marriage is compelling, tragic, and convincing, and that Gina McKee puts on a fascinating performance of a woman of integrity forced by circumstance to compromise her principles, a decision for which she cannot forgive herself or her husband. Anyway, I thought she was absolutely brilliant.",1057881600,26,1911,5.012578616352202
1749520,1,B00006FHZE,"This is supposed to be (according to the novels) the story of people and property--possession.  The theme is carried throughout the novels from Winifred's acquisition of Dartie to
Fleur's desperate attempt to capture Jon.  All this would have
gone on without note except for the intrustion of Beauty in the
face and figure of Irene Heron Forsyte Forsyte, famed for her beauty and her ability to inspire love.  The fatal miscasting of this character (in the otherwise inoffensive Gina McKee) embodies the problem:  you cannot have a story about possession of Beauty if the main character is not only plain but uninteresting.  It is a wonder anyone would cross the street for her, let alone go to the ends of the earth to possess her.  The esstential driving force of the story is that of Soames's need to possess this woman.  To possess Beauty.  It is an admittedly tall order for any woman to portray Love and Beauty in the flesh, but one thinks they could have gotten closer than this.  Similarly, Annette (Soame's second wife) is barely pretty.  It may sound shallow, but these women MUST be beautiful.  That is the point.  Soames's heartache is that he can appreciate Beauty but never understand or earn it.  This version of the saga entirely missed that point.  A shame, really, because it is a really good ""read"".  I'd skip this version entirely.  See the B&W one made by the BBC in the 1960's.  THEY got it right.",1057622400,18,1419,4.703252032520325
1749521,2,B00006FHZE,"I read 9 volumes of Galsworthy's classic and watched the Eric Poter version on PBS twice. This modern version is a terrible disapointment. Obviously low budget and abbreviated it did not capture the essence of what it means to be a Forsyte. It fails at that point.
The existence of the Irene/Bosinney affair is a fundamental feature of the story. It is the fact that the affair occurred that is important. The drawn out sordid details of the details of it went on too long and are boring and irrelevant. With due respect to the beautiful and talented actress, the casting of Irene is a disaster. Young Jolyon is marginal. Winifred's role was misunderstood. The role of June was simply overdone. The producer, director and production crew are too much influenced by soap opera and refuse to bow to the classics. I concede that the classics may be judged as simply high class soaps.  But high class makes an enormous difference.",1054512000,3,926,4.751552795031056
1749522,3,B00006FHZE,"This production of ""The Forsyte Saga"" is certainly pleasing to the eye.  It is one of the more lavish productions to come out of Britain recently.  It is a large enough production that the producers had to make it in two parts (does it conclude the ""Saga"" or does it continue into ""The Modern Comedy?"").
With all of the attention to Late Victorian/Edwardian detail, it is then a mystery to me how the producers leave us with such unsatisfying portrayals of some of the principal characters.
Some portrayals, such as Ben Miles (as Montague Dartie) and John Carlisle (as James Forsyte) were square on the mark.  Also notable are Gillian Kearney (as a rather low-key June Forsyte) and Amanada Root (as Winifred Dartie).  In fact, virtually all of the performances are top-notch.
Outstanding performances, unfortunately, do not compensate for bad casting.  While Damian Lewis gives a memorable performance, his Soames Forsyte barely resembles the character I remember from the books.  Also Irene Forsyte, portrayed by Gina McKee, has to be one of the coldest fishes in recent memory!  Neither of these characters could possibly hope to inspire the slightest feelings of sympathy on the part of the viewer.  Soames comes across at times as purely evil, but one still cannot care much for Irene's plight, as she seems extremely cold-blooded in her own right.
This gives the viewer pause.  I found that in ""The Modern Comedy"" Soames becomes more nuanced and sympathetic as he grows older.  I always thought that Galsworthy rather liked Soames and felt a bit sorry for the man.  It is hard, as one anticipates the second installment of this series, to imagine such a character in the hands of Damian Lewis, at least as he was directed in this series.
The series was enjoyable enough, but not particularly satisfying to those who are familiar with ""The Forsyte Chronicles.""  The books are still the best way to go.",1050278400,8,1905,4.900311526479751
1749523,4,B00006FHZE,"This is a beautifully designed production! However the casting of Gina McKee is dreadfully wrong. It would have been like casting the young Katharine Hepburn as Irene. Just wrong. Mckee is a very intelligent thoughtful actress but projects all the wrong qualities for Irene. Even so, Galsworthy's material is so brilliant and this production so strong, that The Forsyte Saga is STILL worth owning or renting. I'm currently watching the late 60's version-truly superb--and , actually looking forward to the second installment of the newer version, despite Ms. McKee",1049414400,2,564,5.348314606741573
1749524,3,B00006FHZE,"I am a rabid fan of British television, ever since I saw the original 26 episode black-and-white version of The Forsyte Saga in the late 1960s. While I did not expect that the new dramatization of Galsworthy's masterpiece would be an exact recreation of the original (nor should it be), I was expecting that it would be more faithful to the novels. The biggest disappointment was in the casting of Geena McKee in the major female role of Irene Forsyte:it is as though the casting director never read the books. In this case, the producers should have gone to the original series and watched Nyree Dawn Porter, who was the epitome of Galsworthy's Irene. The male cast members generally fare better, especially Colin Redgrave. I was also impressed by the interpretation of Annette, Soames Forsyte's second wife, which, so far, is more faithful to the books than was the original series. Soames and Annette have a marriage of convenience that they work out over the years; it is an interesting counterpoint to the marriage of young Jolyn and Irene, Soames first wife. There are also unsuccessful. and unnecessary, attempts to make the series more ""modern,""for example as in making the rape scene between Soames and Irene more explicit than the original or the book. Although the series is flawed, I am going to watch the second half, which is supposed to air later this year or early next year, but with my fingers crossed that the producers made a better choice in the casting of Fleur Forsyte than they did with Irene. The technical aspects of the production are excellent: the sets are impressive, the costumes are colorful, and the majority of the cast members, especially those in the minor roles, turn in good performances.",1048032000,8,1726,4.854237288135593
1749525,3,B00006FHZE,"This is a visually attractive adaptation of the first half of Galsworthy's ""Forsyte Saga"", but it has nowhere near the depth and impact of the original (1969) TV series.  Most of the actors in this series do a fine job, the one glaring exception is the blank spot on the screen where Irene is supposed to be.  Also, too much has been made of Damian Lewis's ""Soames""--he mumbles his lines through clenched teeth and portrays his character as evil-incarnate.  Soames is much more complex (and better-spoken) than that!
Most of the secondary characters, although well-acted, are not well-developed.  The wonderful idiosyncrasies of the extended Forsyte clan, particularly the aunts and uncles, are ignored in this version.  The interior sets look beautiful, but, although I'm no expert, they don't appear ""Victorian"" to me.  The cinematography is generally good except for the irritating and sophomoric use of focus shifts to film conversations.
Finally, it should be noted that this DVD is only the first half of the series.  Presumably, they are filming the second half and it will eventually be out on DVD for approximately the same price.  The recently released 1969 version, which includes the entire series, thus will hardly cost any more and is incomparably better.",1047513600,16,1269,5.12621359223301
1749556,5,B00006FHZE,"I was a huge fan of the original BBC black & white ""Forsythe Saga"" done back in the late 1960s. Fiction that turns on a hero-villain motif is very dependent, when it comes to the screen, on who plays the villain in chief. Get that wrong and the whole work goes down the drain. Eric Porter did a great job playing Soames Forsythe, the villain, in the original, but Damian Lewis, incredibly, is even better. Actually, he brings you very close to feeling sympathy for Soames by the end, which is no mean feat considering that Soames injures so many other people.  Lewis uses his physicality to great effect in the role as well, especially his pale, cold, unblinking eyes.  All the other actors, by contrast, play largely likable characters.

The plot  concerns an extended well-to-do Victorian family, the Forsythes, who intersect repeatedly with one another in every way conceivable, including romantically, sexually, and financially.  In fact, it borders on the incestuous the way these characters can't seem to find significant others outside of their own bloodline!  Soames does marry an outsider, Irene.  He is obsessed by her yet he revolts her. She was forced into this marriage of convenience by being left destitute at her father's death. Their stormy union brings about almost all the angst of the story line as Soames and Irene tumble into the lives of virtually every other Forsythe, radically upsetting the status quo of family alignments time and again.  Rupert Graves makes a very nice romantic leading man as Soames' artist cousin, young Jolyon, as does Ioan Gruffud as the architect who leads Irene away from Soames.

My favorite episode in the book and both series remains the same.  It is ""Indian Summer of a Forsythe,"" where the marvelous old Jolyon is given an idyllic time with Irene prior to his own encroaching death.  That episode always has a shattering impact of conveying a life well lived and brought to the end the way such a life should be.  Corin Redgrave plays old Jolyon wonderfully.

1749557,2,B00006FHZE,"Take a few twenty-first-century Westerners, transplant them among the wellborn of nineteenth-century England, and you have the characters of this series...or so it seems.  Everyone is supposed to be a well-bred Brit, and yet many of the prominent portrayals are of people who seem unaccountably alien to the depicted time period.  Worse, these characters set the moral tone of the saga, which utterly rings hollow in a Victorian Age drama.  Betrayal of spouse, child, fiancee, and friend is acceptable if sexual desire is strong enough.  Those of an artistic bent are adored and forgiven all, while those of a prudent and practical turn are despised and shunned.  The unconventional is declared beautiful and accepted as such by one and all.  Hardly the stuff of a prim, proper, and strait-laced era!  Overall, the characterizations--though well acted--lack depth, and many of the supporting roles serve as mere props and foils.  All the action seems to spiral toward a central female lead, and when a character is bounced from her direct orbit, he or she withers as a personality within the plot.  There is nothing of the surreal in the story, though some situations seem almost fantastical in their rosy depictions of characters' reduced circumstances.  However, the costumes and settings are typically grand and meticulously authentic, and admirers of British period pieces might well glean appreciation from this alone.",1046736000,5,1423,5.256637168141593
1749558,4,B00006FHZE,"I have neither read John Galsworthy's novels nor seen the classic 1969 BBC version that was the first ""Masterpiece Theater,"" so my perspective is based on recognizing Damian Lewis from ""Band of Brothers,"" Gina McKee from ""Notting Hill,"" Ioan Gruffudd from ""Horatio Hornblower,"" and Amanda Root from ""Persuasion.""  Actually, when I started watching this Granada Television production my immediate thought that this was going to be like ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" and that sooner or later (I assumed later) Soames Forsyte (Lewis) was going to get his comeuppance.  By the end I was thinking more in line of ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" because Young Jolyon Forsyte (Rupert Graves) becomes the other pivotal Forsyte in the saga and his path and Soames do cross throughout.  These comparisons are not meant to be gratuitous, because I think the mini-series at its best is as good as it gets (think ""Shogun,"" ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Pride & Prejudice,"" name your own--in your heart you know that I am right).
The short version of this saga is that it chronicles the lives of three generations of a monied, middle-class English family at the turn of the century.  As our saga begins Winifred (Root) becomes engaged to the wastrel Montague Darties.  Young Jolyon is disowned by his father (Corin Redgrave) after leaving his wife of this daughter June's governess.  Soames is a solicitor who forces his marriage to the beautiful but penniless and therefore desperate Irene, who falls in love with Philip Bosinney, the French architect hired by Soames to build a home in the country.  Those are the starting points for the major characters, but what becomes important is that the characters prove to be dynamic despite all the soap opera elements of the saga.  The predictability of their behavior is tempered by some surprises.  I also want to praise the adaptation by Stephen Mallatratt and Jan McVerry for its use of meaningful looks: there is a scene early on where Soames and his father have a discussion as to how much money to settle on Winifred after her marriage.  Soames says nothing but provokes an entire series of propositions form his father just by minute facial manipulations.
I was rather surprised to learn after the fact that ""The Forsyte Saga"" on these three DVDs is not the entire Galsworthy epic.  What we have hear is based on ""The Man of Property"" (1906), the short story interlude ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"" (1918), and the novel ""In Chancery"" (1920).  There is another interlude, ""Awakening"" (1920) and novel ""To Let"" (1921) which deals with the third generation of the Forsytes, particularly Fleur and Jon, who are born at the end of this series.  However, I was actually pleasantly surprised by where and how the saga ended.  I guess this is an ""average"" British mini-series, which certainly makes it above average by anyone's standards.  I did not enjoy it so much that I want to go out and read Galsworthy's novels, but it is still a worthwhile viewing experience.  However, I do want to check out the old BBC version.",1046217600,12,3030,4.900195694716243
1749559,5,B00006FHZE,"I watched this program on PBS on a whim and fell in love. I think all of the actors did a brillant job in bringing the viewer into the Forsyte world.  The most outstanding I believe was Damian Lewis's portrayal of Soames. He is a wonderful actor with incredible range. He could have easily just been purely a villian, but he showed a very human side of Soames.  He was too repressed to show his true passion and Irene was too self absorbed to appreciate and nurture it. This is a very entertaining period piece with fine acting.

The worst mistake they made was the casting of Soames and Irene.  This Irene is plain, dull, thin and has absolutely no inner fire.  It is absolutely impossible for me to believe that every man who meets this woman falls so totally in love with her that he is hopelessly lost forever.  And Soames is so totally cold that you never truly understand why he burns for this woman.  Even Young Jolyon is a disapointment.  The rest of the cast I must admit are truly wonderful.

I liked Damien Lewis and Gina McKee, but the other actors were as alike as peas in a pod, so it was difficult to tell the characters apart.

Damian Lewis as Soames Forsyte is thoroughly unsympathetic, except for the final moment of the production. Lewis is a fine actor, so I suppose this can be laid at the feet of the director.
But what really sinks this production is Gina McKee. I really liked her in Notting Hill; there, her character and performance lent depth to a vapid movie. Here, however, it is impossible to see what draws so many to her character of Irene Heron Forsyte. The fashions and hairstyles of the day make McKee look emaciated and unattractive (again, contrasting with her loveliness in Notting Hill), and for much of the production her manner seems bordering on a fugue state. For The Forsyte Saga to succeed, the audience must be as enraptured with Irene as the other characters are alleged to be. Instead, I was mystified.
I understand that there is at least one more series to come. I'm not sure why I would want to inflict that on myself, based on this production.",1039651200,7,1114,4.717948717948718
