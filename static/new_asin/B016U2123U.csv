7479911,5,B016U2123U,"After many years of dedicated effort, and despite heartbreaking setbacks, delays, interruptions and production problems that would have caused a less-committed person than the Milton Caniff Estates John Ellis to throw in the towel, the full three-volume DVD set of The Complete Steve Canyon on TV is finally available.

Superlatives fail to describe this 34-episode live-action series that aired on the ABC television network in 1958 and 1959. Featuring U.S. Air Force pilot and troubleshooter Colonel Stevenson B. Canyon, a newspaper comic strip character created by renowned cartoonist Milton Caniff, this is a remarkable series. Even though these shows first aired almost 60 years ago (it hardly seems possible!), Colonel Canyons wide-ranging, gloriously black-and-white adventures, in the air and on the ground, should appeal to nearly everyone.

Do you like aircraft from the early jet age? Youll find them here in profusion, in stunning aerial sequences filmed especially for the show with the full cooperation of the U.S. Air Force (theres little stock footage here). Are you a fan of 1950s television series? None were better than Steve Canyon at delivering just the right mixture of action, suspense, intrigue and romance. Do you enjoy seeing early performances of well-known actors before they made it big? DeForest Kelley, Martin Milner, Mary Tyler Moore, Leonard Nimoy, Marion Ross, William Schallert, Jacqueline Scott, Roy Thinnes and many others guest-star here. Does the work of Milton Caniff, creator of Terry and the Pirates, interest you? His passion for aviation, unstinting demands for accuracy and personal involvement in the details of the show shine through in every episode. Mr. Caniff himself chose Dean Fredericks for the title role, an actor whose previous career peaked as a bit-player in the classic 1954 science fiction film Them!

John Ellis deserves the highest accolades for his magnificent achievement in bringing this long-lost TV series to DVD. He meticulously and professionally restored the half-hour episodes from the original 35mm film network broadcast masters. They look as good as they ever did; they're exceptionally crisp and sharp and have excellent contrast and superb video and audio quality. All but two of them have fascinating audio commentary tracks. Most include ABC promo spots and vintage cigarette commercialsa jarring jolt of nostalgia from a time when everybody smoked all the time on tobacco-company-sponsored TV shows. Thanks to Johns Herculean labors, you can experience for yourself this important artifact of aviation and broadcast TV history.

Each episode is an immensely enjoyable escape into a retro-world of roaring jets, danger in the air and on the ground, and steely-eyed pilots and their girl-next-door sweethearts. This is the kind of really great right stuff that you just don't see on television today.

I have never recommended anything more enthusiastically and unequivocally than I do The Complete Steve Canyon on TV. If you remember watching this series as a child, you should buy the set without a second thought. If not, you should still buy it. Theres never been anything like it on television, and there never will be again.

Many thanks and a hearty Cheers! to John Ellis on behalf of all the Steve Canyon fans out here. Well done!",1446336000,6,3315,5.304761904761905
7479912,5,B016U2123U,"I fondly remember (but just barely) watching Steve Canyon as a child. My Ideal Toy Steve Canyon Jet Helmet is long gone, and I always presumed any chance of ever seeing these shows again was long gone, too. But here they are, beautifully restored. I've enjoyed watching every episode as well as listening to the commentaries. The vintage commercials and network promos are fun, too. If you like Steve Canyon, cool 1950s Air Force footage, or just vintage television programming in general, buy this set. You won't be disappointed.",1446249600,,530,4.966292134831461
7479913,5,B016U2123U,"What a treasure these are, never thought I would see the day when the Steve Canyon series would make it to DVD. Many thanks to John Ellis for all his work doing the restoration. With each season the quality of the discs improved, was amazed just how good they looked. Great cover art on the cases and box set slipcover. Steve Canyon has never looked better.  One of the best shows to come out of the 50's.",1445385600,3,405,4.259740259740259
7479914,5,B016U2123U,"I bought this directly from the producer of this DVD Box-Set and I am amazed at the quality product they sent me. Neat art direction on all the packaging brought up high hopes for the TV Show itself and Steve Canyon did not disappoint. The contemporary Air Force footage is worth the price of admission alone and contrary to many vintage shows there are some very attractive ladies in Major Canyon's world.
All in all super high quality vintage entertainment recommended for all audiences not just vintage plane buffs.",1445212800,3,518,4.831460674157303
7479915,5,B016U2123U,"If you're an aviation history buff, never mind whether or not you think you're a ""Steve Canyon"" fan: you are. These episodes are an absolute goldmine of largely unique footage from a fascinating period in USAF history. The episodes themselves hold up well, thanks in part to strong writing and a parade of intriguing guest stars, but mostly due to the almost absurdly meticulous restoration efforts of producer John Ellis. The transfers are staggeringly crisp and clean; when star Dean Fredericks steps forward to tell you to smoke Chesterfields, you'd swear he was right there in your living room. If your living room was shot in black and white, that is, and if it was the sort of place where actors might suddenly appear selling cigarettes.

If early Cold War-era aviation is of even passing interest to you, then this set is a must, period.",1445212800,4,844,4.820689655172414
7479916,5,B016U2123U,"Outstanding from every aspect.  Superb video transfer from original well stored film.  This series has been off the air since the 1960s.  It even has a bunch old, now banned, cigarette commercials and promos for other shows.  The list of guest stars and cameos is staggering.  Not to be missed.",1445212800,6,294,4.8
7479917,5,B016U2123U,"I love it!  I love it!  The Cerebral show way ahead of it's time!  Some of the plots, subplots and scenarios have never been done in TV history!
They censors were blind to this and much more.  It was a trip in time to my youth!  Thank you Milt Caniff, The Air Force and John Ellis for this masterpiece.",1445212800,5,302,4.0508474576271185

8737265,5,B016U2123U,"If you are a 60's TV buff and in addition, an admirer of our armed services, this is for you.  Yes, the episodes are patriotic, pro-Air Force, whatever. So what?!  Great buy.  However, DO NOT buy this if you are expecting to see Steven Canyon, the cartoon strip character. This is a totally different rendition of Canyon. The aircraft portrayed in each and every episode are absolutely gorgeous for plane buffs, from the B-29 bomber up to the B-52 and all other aircraft in the USAF from the late 40's to the 60's.  This series of DVD's reminds you of what America once stood for and to boot, you get live action video of a lot of vintage jets.  Could not have been more pleased.  Sound and video are pretty crisp for a 60's series.  Highly recommend.  Also would recommend ""The Lieutenant"" DVD series, another 60's TV series not heard of too much.  It's for Marines what Steve Canyon is to the Air Force.  And if you are a Star Trek TV buff, many of the guests on The Lieutenant became regulars on Star Trek a few years later (I believe Gene Roddenberry directed/produced both series).",1484006400,2,1086,4.494897959183674

Very pleased with this seller & quality of the restoration of this great show. Haven't seen Steve Canyon in about 55 years, flood of memories coming back. Quality of show and packaging 5 star.",1480896000,,358,4.885245901639344
8737267,5,B016U2123U,"If you're not into older ""vintage"" TV series of the late 50's and 60's, you probably won't be buying Steve Canyon anytime soon.  But I  honestly think you'll be missing out.  Out on what?  A very interesting, well thought-out script and story line episodic series...with great 'vintage' clips (file and allegedly purposely shot for this USAF sanctioned series) of USAF aircraft, period bases and service life along with a revealing glimpse into what made the Air Force so great in it's heady, post WWII early days as a fledgling, but rapidly growing autonomous service.  Well...at least that's how it hits me.  Great stuff. Dean Fredericks as Lt Col Steve Canyon on special TDY/mission taskings by Dept of Air Force/HQ is 'perfect' in this role and amazingly looks just like the Steve Canyon in Milton Caniff's original comic strips.  Amazing likeness and 'believe-ability"".  Each story is different (supposedly based on an actual USAF project or event), and the video and audio quality is surprisingly good.  I also liked the period TV commercials (from subsequent re-runs on different network).  A nostalgia trip for me?  Perhaps. I remember this series from when I was a single digit punkster.  But I find the look back into ""the way it was"" during the beginnings of the Cold War and prior to the roaring 60's and Vietnam Era most entertaining, enlightening and enjoyable.  So enjoy for yourself too!",1456099200,,1403,4.995689655172414

8737269,5,B016U2123U,"Enormously happy with this set. The quality is perfect. The show is a great snapshot of the cold war era, but full of good old American optimism. Great trip back in time. Good work by the Caniff Estate, who I know worked very hard to get this out.",1454025600,3,247,4.166666666666667
8737270,5,B016U2123U,"This is a fantastic collection of the entire Steve Canyon TV series.  While I was to young to enjoy it when it originally aired, I really enjoy watching the remastered DVD's.  My eldest son liked the episodes so much I bought him his own set for Christmas.  You can tell the love and attention put into restoring this series as the picture quality is excellent.  I read where each frame was individually cleaned up and restored which is why it took so many years to complete  the series DVD collection.  It was well worth the wait so pop one into your DVD player, sit back in your recliner with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy wonderfully restored vintage television.",1453420800,,663,4.529411764705882
