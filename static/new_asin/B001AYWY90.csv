8280315,5,B001AYWY90,A fun version of the Biblical story... Funny to read how people get caught up over the little crab who is trying to point Jonah in the right direction...  I know a lot of crabby people who point me in the wrong direction!  Buy this one!,1466035200,,236,4.108695652173913
8280316,5,B001AYWY90,Woah!  Why all the negative reviews??  Fantastic re telling of the classic bible story. Kids love it. I highly recommend this film!  It's a great way to teach your kids the bible story. A great Sunday movie!,1440201600,,207,4.54054054054054
8280317,1,B001AYWY90,This is a really lousy video.  The animation is terrible and the narrative is worse.,1436313600,,84,4.6
8280318,1,B001AYWY90,"ugly movie don't waste your money the movie is just 5minutes long, I think they screw up on this one",1405382400,,100,4.05
8280319,2,B001AYWY90,"The movie quality is great and the story is cute, but its' not biblically accurate.  In this story Jonah has a little hermit crab who travels with him and is constantly trying to get him to obey the Lord, which is of course not in the real story, lol.",1312329600,4,251,4.122448979591836
