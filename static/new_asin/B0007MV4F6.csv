8174948,3,B0007MV4F6,"This is a compilation of old newsreels, theatrical shorts, and advertising documentaries, interesting for the history buff but of little practical use for the prospective visitor. I enjoyed it, but I was surprised when it came to an end after an hour and three minutes instead of the two hours and seven minutes promised. Not sure who's responsible for this lack of truth in advertising, but I'm going to ask Amazon to refund my money.",1285200000,,435,4.8133333333333335

It' sinterseting to see clips that are much more an example of amature footage than of pre-processed travel advertisments and the older quality of the clips makes them seem more real to me.",1147132800,,431,4.597402597402597
