This is rare in that it scared the living hell out of me at points and drew me in and held my attention all the way through. And the creators managed all this without blood and gore!

WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS WOMAN WHO COMES AND STAYS WITH THEM AND HAS A PREVIOUS CONNECTION TO THE HOUSE, AND IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE EITHER.
IT IS MORE ON THE LINES OF A THRILLER THAN AN ACTUAL HORROR FILM.  STILL IT'S WELL DONE AND A GREAT CAST AND A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH ON A RAINY DAY OR ON A NIGHT WITH THE LIGHTS OUT AND A VERY VERY BIG BOWL OF POPCORN.",993081600,5,530,3.8

7851518,1,6303626513,"This movie sucks. IT sucks more than the suckiest suck of a film ever sucked.
Think of this film as a food.
A movie like Insidious or even a classic like Rats: Night of Terror, would be classed as a giant steak, in which you could wrap your meat loving mouth around and savour in its juicy goodness, take a bite, linger in its brilliance, and have a swig of beer and just enjoy the bliss you're feeling.
A Haunting At Seacliff Inn would be classed - in comparison - to a long drawn out segment of human excrement. It smells bad, tastes worse, and should only be in two places: A hole in the ground, or in your toilet.",1453507200,,617,4.15

7851520,4,6303626513,"Released to TV in 1994, The Haunting of Seacliff Inn stars Ally Sheedy and William R. Moses as a couple who move to coastal Northern California to start a bed & breakfast after purchasing an old mansion. Curious things start to happen as they discover their new abode to be haunted. Lucinda Weist plays their alluring first guest while Maxine Stuart plays a New Agey neighbor. James Horan is also on hand.

While this is a TV movie (USA), the production values are quite good, particularly the stunning coastal locations. The first 35 minutes are pretty routine, but things pick up when the couple receive their first guest, a mysterious writer (Weist). From there the storys compelling to the end. The subplot about the couple's troubled marriage is well done: The husband had an affair back in San Francisco and it simply takes time & attention to win trust back, which is hard to do when there's a ravishing half-naked brunette hanging around. Will they stay together?

This is more of a haunting ghost movie than horror flick. So don't expect hardcore horror and all that goes with it. If you enjoy movies like The Fog or The Amityville Horror, particularly the remakes, youll probably like The Haunting of Seacliff Inn.

The movie runs 94 minutes and was shot in Mendocino and Adolpho Camarillo Ranch, California.

GRADE: B

EXPLANATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie)

Sara Warner (Weist) returned from the dead likely at the behest of the male ghost doing the actual haunting, Jeremiah Hastings. Her mission was to seduce the husband, Mark, away from his wife, with the intent of breaking up their marriage. The husband, however, finds the moral strength to resist and rejects Sara. Her purpose thwarted she simply returns to the dead. She committed suicide in 1882 by drowning herself at the beach so that's where she goes. Now Hastings takes matters into his own hands.",1436918400,,1914,4.873846153846154

7851522,5,6303626513,"This made-for- TV haunted house film is one of my guilty favorites, one that I revisit every now and again. I guess it's a nostalgic trip as well, as I remember watching this with my college mates back in the early 90s and having a lot of fun while doing so. Ally Sheedy and William R. Moses play Susan and Mark Enright, a yuppie couple who have given it all up and moved away from the city to try and save their troubled marriage. Susan and Mark have decided to set up a B&B by the coast in a small coastal town, but Susan, despite Mark's misgivings, decides on another property that they had not initially chosen. This house is not for sale, but Susan finds herself strangely drawn to it, and she decides to befriend the occupant. Strangely enough, the old lady occupying the house inexplicably dies from a domestic accident, and Susan and Mark are able to purchase the property.

From then on, strange things plague the property. It is as if Susan's presence has awakened something long dormant within the house, something that is drawn to Susan and desires Susan. The rest of the story deals with the couple's attempts to make sense of what is happening to them and to try and solve the mystery of Seacliff Inn. I thought this was a pretty decent production for a made-for-TV film and the haunted house premise was well-executed. Ally Sheedy and William R. Moses are OK in their respective roles although Moses seems rather stiff at times, and Sheedy is prone to over-acting. Overall, the haunting score and seaside scenery as well as the camera effects make this an effective chiller that is not really scary but atmospheric and tastefully done.",1419984000,,1650,4.612244897959184

7851525,3,6303626513,"I had watched the last five minutes of this movie years ago and it must have left quite an impression on me as Id always hoped that Id one day get to see it in its entirety. Having caught up with it on YouTube, its clear that sometimes your memory clouds the quality of certain things, for The Haunting of Sea Cliff Inn certainly falls into the so bad its good category. The dialogue is clumsy and the acting rather stilted, but its a fun watch with a few spooky moments.

Mark and Susan are a yuppie couple from San Francisco who leave their careers behind them to open up a Bed and Breakfast, only for Susan to be drawn to a beautiful old homestead on the coast. An elderly woman lives there, but Susan is convinced that the house should be hers. After the owner dies in a freak accident, its only a matter of time before Mark and Susan move in.

Almost immediately, strange things begin to happen. A black dog stalks Susan on the beach, an electrician gets a nasty shock during the renovation process, and a mysterious young woman who seems intent on seducing Mark checks into a room. Susan is convinced that the house is haunted (much to Marks frustration) but isn't sure by who. The weirdness begins to escalate, along with the strain upon their marriage, until finally the existence of the supernatural cant be denied.

Most ghost stories are built on strange occurrences having a certain logic behind them. When the victims of hauntings start to figure out the mystery of the past, the supernatural events become clear in their meaning and purpose. The Haunting of Sea Cliff Inn answers perhaps 80% of the questions it raises, though quite a lot remains unresolved. Still, its a coherent ghost story, and many of the more obscure bits of the haunting (such as Sarah Warners involvement and the significance of the black dog) can be inferred by the audience.

Way too much time is spent on scenes of Mark and Susan either fighting or passionately making out, and the special effects are hopelessly dated. But as a window back into the nineties (the clothes, the hair, the technology) its actually quite fun, and the film deserves some credit for having several spooky sequences happen in broad daylight.",1389398400,,2209,4.627551020408164
