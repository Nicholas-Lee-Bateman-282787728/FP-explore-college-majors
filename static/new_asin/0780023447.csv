32961,5,0780023447,"The period of time after the end of the Second World War, and the beginning of the great economic miracle for Japan was one that is a mystery to most westerners.  Living in the poverty left by the war, crime flourished, the black market thrived, and those ""angels"" like doctors and other professionals not lost in the war took on a new role, often serving the denizens of TB- and infection-ridden neighborhoods for little pay and nearly no respect.  The interplay of Kurasawa's favorite pair (Mifune and Shimura) provides a tense and gripping story of life in a nation desperately trying to pull itself out from the throes of war.  Filmed in glorious black and white, it retains much of the stark interest of other postwar films, such as Stray Dog, arguably one of Kurosawa's best.",980121600,7,781,4.727941176470588
32962,5,0780023447,"the movie is excellent without any traces of the commercialism that splashes the movies of today and makes them appear rehashed and contrived.  a beautiful, sad and touching storyline that contributes to the grace of  kurosawa's flowing style of filming and brilliantly stark camerawork.  toshiro mifune is masterful in his portrayal of a gangster torn apart by  the conflict of saving his own life or preserving his image.  one of the  director's many seminal works- philosophical and charmingly amusing.  leaves the viewer wondering, half-ashamed, why so much of the seemingly  obvious magic in life explored in this picture remains undiscovered until  we look closer and learn to appreciate it.  a rainy saturday afternoon kind  of film that is both thought-provoking and very entertaining in its  portrayal of life in pre-war japan.",961718400,7,836,5.297709923664122
32963,5,0780023447,"When I first saw this film, it took my breath away.  Mifune's performance is absolutely overpowering, and the whole structure and pace of the film is just right.  It is one of my favorite of Kurosawa's films, and the fact  that it is now finally being released to the public thrills me. It has not  been very available and is probably the most underappreciated of Kurosawa's  masterpieces.
Drunken Angel is a contemporary tale of the squalor of  postwar Japanese society, and of an angel shining his light through the  darkness to help those few he can.  This film introduces for the first time  many themes, symbols, and ideas that recieve their consummate expression in  Kurosawa's later films, such as Ikiru, and even beyond, and around which  Kurosawa's entire body of work revolves.
We see in the gangster the first  lead performance of Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest actors ever to  honor the cinema with his presence, and in the doctor the first truly great  performance by Takashi Shimura, the most reliable and talented actor in the  Kurosawa group.  This role also helps to contribute in subtle ways to his  greatest performance, that of Watanabe in Ikiru.
And of Kurosawa himself,  what can I say, he has once again left me at a loss for words.  The end  fight sequence with the mirror and the paint is pure cinematic genius.
So  this film is a definite must see, not only for fans of Kurosawa, but for  the entire world.  It has my highest recommendation.",961459200,14,1472,4.708661417322834

Great acting and directing and yet a very boring film still came out of it. The premise is too obvious and uninteresting to be worthy for a Great Kurosawa film and this film suffers because of it.

Mifune and Shimura are captivating but they play great characters in a very boring and predictable story with plot developments you can see coming a mile away, by the second hour the film was dragging, and became predictable and tedious. The story is non-existent and the characters are so undeveloped that one could care less about them.

So unspeakably boring that I had to turn it off each twenty minutes to walk around, and I felt I had deserved a medal for that. And, by the way, I generally love Kurosawa films.",1385424000,,851,4.592105263157895
32976,5,0780023447,One of the best noir films. Gorgeous filmmaking. A period of Kurosawa's that is important to see--the early personal noir stories.,1378080000,,130,5.238095238095238
32977,5,0780023447,"This story of an immediately post-war Japan is an incredibly scratched movie with a fuzzy sounding soundtrack. There was little preservation of film originals in immediately postwar Japan. The story and the cinematography are edgy in a way that makes me think of the life of a hungry stray cat or dog. This movie is forever paired with ""Stray Dog"" in my mind. For that reason, I think, it is one of Kurosawa's greatest films. In his later films there were many additional takes. This one has a feel of one takes throughout. I might mention that I was surprised that the commentary made no mention of the singer of ""Jungle Boogie,"" Shizuko Kasagi, who was the boogie woogie queen of Japan and whose song, ""Tokyo Boogie Woogie,"" is one of the most iconic songs of the early occupation era. Even today if you mention this song everyone knows it.",1361059200,4,842,4.62
32978,4,0780023447,"On an international scale, I don't know that there's a cinematic collaboration more celebrated or relevant than that between director Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune. (Sorry, John Ford and John Wayne.) 1948's DRUNKEN ANGEL (""Yoidore tenshi"") is a landmark film on several fronts. With DRUNKEN ANGEL Kurosawa was at last able to get his vision across without egregious meddling from the studio. This is also the first time he would work with Mifune. As for the young and fiery Toshiro Mifune, his role here would be his breakthru performance.

Kurosawa would work with Mifune for a sum of sixteen films, a collaboration eclipsed in number only by Takashi Shimura, who would be featured in twenty Kurosawa pictures. Here, Takashi Shimura has to work hard to not get overwhelmed by Mifune's dynamic presence. Shimura plays the titular role, a dedicated physician who maybe likes his liquor too much. In the slums of post-war Tokyo, Doctor Sanada tends to his sickly flock with vigor and belligerence. This aggressive demeanor is applied even to his newest patient, the tempestuous Yakuza, Matsunaga (Mifune), who approaches Sanada with a bullet wound on his hand. During his ministrations, Sanada learns that Matsunaga exhibits the late stages of advanced tuberculosis, a leading disease in the squalid quarters of post-war Japan. (No, it doesn't help that Sanada and Matsunaga's neighborhood envelops a toxic cesspool.) DRUNKEN ANGEL tracks the quarrelsome relationship between doctor and gangster. There are lots of shoving and punching and threats and hurling of objects. It's a sort of friendship, I guess.

More than any of his contemporaries in Japan, Kurosawa embraced Western cinema. In DRUNKEN ANGEL one can pick out elements from Italian neo-realism and Hollywood crime noir. When I first saw DRUNKEN ANGEL, I thought of the Italian classic, THE BICYCLE THIEVES (also from 1948). Both films evoke a sense of despair and bleakness amidst bustling squalor. In this hellish backdrop, the characters play out their internal struggles.

I wonder how taken aback the Japanese audience must've been when the glowering Toshiro Mifune first stalked the silver screen? There's something so caged tigery about him, a primal presence that was decidedly not in keeping with the more contemplative 1940s Japanese cinema. Even when his character was in full-on suave mode, there's still something baleful in his gaze. It's all the more fascinating, witnessing Matsunaga's gradual fall from grace in the Yakuza, his worsening tuberculosis triggering the inevitable demotion. But is being kicked to the curb enough to change a violent criminal for the better? Toshiro Mifune's fierce performance doesn't lend itself to easy predictability. Takashi Shimura, who himself submits a more subtle but equally stylish performance, matches Mifune scene for scene. Shimura is like a chameleon. He can play any part. His role in DRUNKEN ANGEL is a far cry from his roles in, say, THE SEVEN SAMURAI and IKIRU. And the director, Akira Kurosawa? What else? He's masterful yet again, his discerning eye capturing the humanity and nobility of even those who inhabit a place bereft of hope. DRUNKEN ANGEL isn't near the top of most folks' lists when debating the best films of Kurosawa, Mifune, and Shimura. But it's a meaningful picture and worth a moment of your time.",1347235200,3,3352,5.226765799256506
32979,3,0780023447,"Unfortunately this is one of the VERY lesser releases from The Criterion Collection. First, the video transfer, in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, is from a really bad source, and the film is at a mediocre ten year old VHS tape quality, laden with lines, scratches, ghosts, blobs, and assorted other imperfections- the worst reel is the `dream sequence.' What is puzzling is how Criterion has boasted , in the past, of restoring film quality to films that were far better, to begin with. As example are the re-releases for Seven Samurai and Federico Fellini's Amarcord, whose initial releases had a quality of 90-95 (on a scale of 100, and the rerelease upped that about 5 points. By contrast, this release of Drunken Angel is at a substandard 55-60. Granted, the costs of this would be far more daunting than the tweaks given to the other films, but....is not that the supposed stated reason Criterion exists? If all we were to get was a half-assed job, then perhaps this could be an Image Entertainment release? The audio portion of this release is not much better. Naturally, no English language dubbed track exists either, and Criterion continues its misguided policy of using white subtitles for a black and white film which often makes reading them an exercise in eyestrain.

  The supplements are a bit better, with a 31 minute long making of documentary on the film, part of the Toho Masterworks series Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful To Create. It has some interesting information, but the better feature is Kurosawa And The Censors, a 25 minute long video piece that looks at what Kurosawa faced from American propagandists, while shooting the film, and how that was similar yet different from the censorship he faced under the militarist years of Japan. There's also an insert booklet with an essay by cultural historian Ian Buruma, and excerpts from Kurosawa's memoir, Something Like An Autobiography. Then there is an audio commentary by the hit and miss Japanese film historian Donald Richie, who relates how he was on the set for the filming of Drunken Angel, the first time he was ever invited to do so, and where he first met Kurosawa. It's an ok commentary from Richie, who manages to be hit and miss within a single commentary- usually he's on the mark or rambles off into his own hermetic world of memories. While almost never scene specific with comments, Richie does make some good points, but he also makes some key errors. As example, he feels the film is a bit didactic and preachy, but this really isn't the case. Dr. Sanada is didactic, but the film is not. The film is rather impassive toward its inhabitants. On the other hand, the film does have some flaws, like reveling in American gangster clichs, that Richie does not expound upon. He does pick up on something that I noticed right away, that the film is set in summer, but was filmed in January- thus why characters are seen in light wear, but their breath is visible in the air. But then he gaffes by claiming Sanada and Matsunaga are opposite sides of the same coin. But they are clearly not. Sharing some similarities does not make a pair of individuals part of the same coin. The two men have differing temperaments, philosophies, habits, and goals. Overall, though, it's a solid performance by Richie.

  The same can be said for Drunken Angel. It has flaws (as I've detailed above), and they are manifest; the worst of them being a dream sequence where the consumptive Matsunaga emerges from a casket to chase himself on a shoreline. This was done better a decade later, in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, and over three decades later in Kurosawa's own Kagemusha. But, it also deftly uses symbolism, visual and musical, and this overcomes its occasional fall into gangster clichs. Kurosawa, himself, felt that this was his first `real' film, the first unencumbered by interference from outside sources. Thus, it is like its creator, a thing aborning, and while that fact does not mitigate the film's flaws, it does add a bit more to some scenes and actions, for the cineaste, for it adds a duplicity to them: one sees both the flaw and imagines how the older, better Kurosawa would have handled such a scene. And, let's face facts; given that it's Kurosawa, even his biggest flaws are better than the greatest merits of many lesser filmmakers. Thus, the word interesting has more aptness than good, bad, or variants thereof. Take that not as a copout, but an observation, flaws notwithstanding.",1339027200,6,4480,4.811688311688312
32980,3,0780023447,"As understood, post-WWII Japan was under the U.S. occupation filled with prosperity to move from ""feudalistic"" to the Western way of living as film's major characters, a TB-stricken yakuza-man and a sober GP exemplified.

The stuborness of the Dr for trying to save and reddem the gangster runs parallel to the roughness for this thief to admit his illness and recognize he will die. Both characters are depicted with such humanity that it will be difficult for us to assume encountered positions.

32983,5,0780023447,"This is my favourite Kurosawa film. I tend to prefer (and relate) to more intimate, simple (or rather deceptively simple) films that deal with supposedly trivial human issues. Individuals as opposed to epic set pieces involving countries far and wide, war and political intrigue ... no thanks. One thing that can be said about Kurosawa's films is that, no matter the plot itself, they always deal with the characters themselves and not necessarily with the events going on on-screen.

Drunken Angel is a straight-forward film that is existential at times (being an existentialist - completely out of favour with the enlightened majority nowadays I'm told - I support this aspect), but also frighteningly honest at times (not to say that existentialism isn't honest - far from it, but Kurosawa takes a side and makes a firm decision to support one side over the other, wherein the pure existentialist would parlay on behalf of both sides ... or neither).

The film is of course strewn together with bits of symbolism and doomed fates intertwining and mingling between addictions and addictive personalities. The diseased pool omnipresent and sparkling with carrier mosquitoes while the children play near it unaware and joyfully uncaring, the drunken angel himself (Shimura) stuck amidst the cesspool forming an odd relationship with a young gangster (Mifune), perhaps seeing something of himself in that proud reckless face. Shimura is the anti-hero (one of Kurosawa's many anti-heroes), a flawed Samaritan who perhaps has found kindness in his doomed alcoholic state and seeks to form a fruitless one-sided friendship with another also doomed by the social criminal ladder of alcoholic proportions.

This is Kurosawa depicting humanity in its raw quivering form, but doing so in an understated, tasteful way and not yieldingly or cowardly (as many ""controversial"" directors often attempt to do).

The film ends with Shimura, the doctor, accepting what all doctors must accept, that he is only life's tool, he can only delay the inevitable. He must accept losing control, losing himself (or what he saw of himself in Mifune), to a force as powerful as addiction and as uncompromising. I wouldn't wish this realization on anyone and yet Kurosawa depicts it not in a sappy depressing way, but on realistic terms. It is what it is, there is no need for sorrow or regret, only acceptance and an infusion of meaning into the supposedly trivial things. For Shimura, perhaps its an alcoholic rejuvenation or perhaps it will be his salvation from that prison. Kurosawa, ever the realist, leaves that puzzle unfinished as it should be and Shimura and Mifune's fates end up being neither sad nor joyous, but simply meant to be.",1238371200,2,2717,5.126410835214447
32984,5,0780023447,"Most reviews of Drunken Angel characterize it as the story about a good-hearted but flawed doctor and his gangster patient.  I've watched this film closely many times and I disagree that the doctor is well intentioned.  Surprised by this conclusion?  Read on.

Carefully watch the response that the doctor shows to the gangster throughout the film.  First, he refuses to use an anesthetic on the gangster's hand when he removes a bullet.  Interestingly, the audience learns of Matsunaga's strength against pain, and learns of the doctor's willingness to inflict it.

The film then shows various scenes where the doctor goads his patient over the gangster's fear of tuberculosis, and the gangster's predictable response is anger toward the ""treatment.""  The senior doctor from the hospital eventually has to ask the alcoholic doctor why he did not help Matsunaga when the gangster humbled himself and asked for help.  All the alcoholic doctor can do is to ask for more alcohol -- because he drank all the pure ethanol alcohol that was provided to him for use on patients.

When the gangster is greatly sick and must stay at the clinic to heal, the doctor announces that he will call on the police to protect all involved from a rival gangster.  Involving police in a gangland dispute violates every code of conduct known to Matsunaga, and he must flee.  Did the doctor know better?  Yes, at an earlier point in the film he admits that Matsunaga reminds him of his own youth.  Like Carlito Brigante of Carlito's Way, which is another film about a gangster trying to go straight, it is the doctor who cannot resist his old gangster instincts and becomes locked into a running conflict with Matsunaga.

Kurosawa understood that to make the film work as a story the audience had to like the gangster and dislike the doctor.  This is a reversal that Japanese audiences had never seen before, and the actors and director were able to accomplish the feat.  As the film closes, the audience grieves Matsunaga's tragic death while the film score and stage choreography move in unison to maximize the impact.  The final fight and death of Matsunaga is considered classic cinematography worldwide.  Matsunaga finally escapes his gangster life through death.

There is another aspect to Drunken Angel that most people forget: it is one of several Kurosawa films with a medical and public health aspect to it.  Other films like Ikuru, Red Beard, the Silent Duel, and the Most Beautiful, also include sickness and medicine prominently in their plots.  Where Kurosawa's interest in medicine originated is not well addressed in his biographical materials.  By contrast, Kurosawa's ability to direct important films on Judo fighting likely came from experience within Kurosawa's own family.  Throughout the years of imperial rule, Akira Kurosawa's father headed a public high school that specialized in martial arts training for young Japanese.  Possibly it was the death of three older brothers and one older sister (whom he called, ""little big sister"")that spurred Kurosawa's interest in medicine and health.",1198368000,2,3092,5.075247524752475
32985,5,0780023447,"Drunken Angel is a significant film in the pantheon of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces. For one its one of his first major succeses after eight films. Its Kurosawa's first time working with the actor he became most associated with, Toshiro Mifune. And years after the end of WWII its a great film made successfuly under strict allied censorship.

The film itself is a tale involving two men on, a doctor and a young yakuza living in a swampy slum outlying Tokyo. The doctor, the titular Drunken Angel is Sanada who makes a pitiful ammount treating poor residents while mixing tea with pure alcohol (easier to get than bootleg whiskey on the black market). Into his life comes young Matsunaga, the leader of a small group. Matsunaga comes saying that he was injured from a door which left a piece in his hand. Of course when Sanada pulls the piece out it looks suspiciously like a bullet. Then Matsunaga coughs and Sanada becomes concerned that he might have tuberculosis. Matsunaga laughs him off but Sanada won't stop tailing Matsunaga as he grows sicker even though most of their run ins end with him being thrown to the ground or fighting with the younger man. Things get complicated when the original head of the family gets released from prison, who just happens to hold Sanada's nurse under his thumb. Where it goes from there I won't say.

This is simply a great film. After I watched Stray Dog for the first time this was one film I had wanted to see for a long time and it thankfully didn't disappoint me. For one thing there is the humanity that Kurosawa embues in his characters that makes them human and interesting. The great Takashi Shimura who played the leader of the Seven Samurai is excellent as Sanada a little man who fights hard trying to protect peoples health living in the slum surrounded by stagnant swamps. Its an easy character to like especially involving the character of young girl also suffering from TB who's almost healed. Without a doubt though the reason to see this movie is Toshiro Mifune as Matsunaga. In his later work with Kurosawa he mostly played gruffer older men, sly and cunning characters that fit the action. Here Mifune was in his mid-twenties, a brash and impudent young man and it tempers his performance as the young hothead. He's rakish and dismissive but also charming in a way that makes him watchable.  On the opposite side of the camera of course Kurosawa holds his own as a writer and a director with little touches here and there to bring his slums to life. Some memorable traits I enjoyed are the musical moments like a night club scene where you can see Matsunaga's relationship with his boss slowly disintegrating. And for the first half of the movie theres a bit with a guitarist outside of the doctors office playing a mournful tune. When the lead gangster shows up people know of his return as he takes the mans guitar and plays his own little song. Its a shame that Kurosawa only worked with Mifune for twenty years but every one of their films together is a terrific piece of entertainment. See this movie to see how it began.

The DVD itself from Criterion is of course worth every penny for any fan of Kurosawa. The image is somewhat scratched in places with visible lines running through the image but compared to other films of the age on DVD it is restored greatly from what it could have been from a lesser company. Theres an audio commentary from noted film historian Donald Richie and two documentaries. One is the usual Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to create ported from Japan which does hold a lot of information on the making of the film. The second titled Kurosawa and the Censor is a documentary produced for the dvd documenting the postwar censorhip filmmakers faced from several agencies set up by the government and military. Its a fascinating piece featuring documents from the period with hand written notes outlining problems. For fans of Japanese films this is an interesting historical feature. All in all the usual well rounded package from Criterion and well worth the price.",1196640000,5,4065,4.705056179775281

Takashi Shimura (the head samurai in ""Seven Samurai"") plays an alcoholic doctor in a dumpy urban part of post-war Tokyo. Toshiro Mifune plays a small-time gangster who initially visits the doctor regarding a bullet wound. The doctor discovers that the gangster also has tuberculosis, and stubbornly tries to treat it. I say stubbornly because the gangster tries to act macho about the disease. The two charactors are both so strongly portrayed that the doctor's attempt to treat the disease and the gangster's faked but desperate non-chalance makes their relationship a struggle; at times they actually come to blows over the doctor's persistence. The doctor, I think, sees something of himself in the gangster; someone on the edge of society, someone with flaws, someone with unfulfilled dreams.

Besides being an early Kurosawa film, this cinematic masterpiece also  gives us a glimpse of Toshiro Mifune; and why he would go on to become one of Japan's legends of cinema. However, for me, the role portrayed by Takashi Shimura is outstanding. This noir classic follows the life of a gangster, Matsunaga (Toshiro Mifune), who goes to see an alcoholic doctor named Dr. Sanada, aptly portrayed by (Takashi Shimura).

Doctor Sanada (Takashi Shimura) detests the Yakuza, however, since Matsunaga (Mifune) has tuberculosis: a disease rampant in post-war Japan, the doctor resolves to help this gangster in order to eliminate the threat of this disease in his community. Both of these great cinematic giants give riveting performances, and it is not too hard to see why both would become such great actors. Both compliment each other. This is also the first of many films by both Toshiro Mifune, and director Akira Kurosawa.

""Drunken Angel"" is definetly a 'Masterpiece' of cinema. Moreover, the films gritty and realistic portrayal of the blighted neighborhood of post-war Tokyo, where the raw sewage is carrying diseases throughout the city, is portrayed in a very disturbing manner. The film was produced in 1948, not long after the second world war ended; thus, the film gives a somewhat realistic look of just how post-war Japan, and Tokyo in particular looked during the filming. The film is brilliant and highly recommended. It belongs in your cinema collection!",1165968000,,1628,5.089887640449438
32988,5,0780023447,"Akira Kurosawa's disturbing ""Drunken Angel"" is an unfettered look into the horror and decay of post war Japan.  The film in a realistic approach focuses on a desolate and blighted neighborhood in Tokyo where raw sewage carrying disease sits in a huge puddle in the midst of the populace.

Neighborhood denizen Takashi Shimura playing alcoholic but dedicated Doctor Sanada receives a visit from young local Yakuza boss Matsunaga played by Toshiro Mifune to have a bullet removed from his hand.  While examining the young man the doctor detects the presence of TB which is running rampant through the city.  Mifune's tough gangster veneer is threatened by this revelation and his own fear makes him balk at seeking treatment.  Shimura pursues Mifune pleading with him trying to coax him into treatment and as a result forms an uneasy alliance with the hoodlum.

Shimura meanwhile is living with a woman who serves as a nurse named Miyo played by Chieko Nakakita.  She had previously been the woman of Yakuza boss Okada played by Reisaburo Yamamato, who was Mifune's boss and had been in prison for the past 3 years.  When he arrived back on the scene he seized back the reins of power of the gang back from Mifune.  Mifune by now felt indebtted to the doctor to protect him and his woman Miyo against the unwanted advances of Okada.  Mifune in a weakened diseased state in a memorable scene battled Okada is a lethal knife fight.

Kurosawa paints a bleak sobering portrait of life in late 1940's Japan with a decaying environment and imperfect characters Mifune and Shimura who both displayed impressive screen presence in their roles.  He nonetheless does insert a ray of hope in his film.  A young 17 year old female patient of Shimura's also suffering with TB, who visits him throughout the film, has been cured after diligently following his treatment as the film concludes.",1138838400,3,1876,4.861635220125786

32991,5,0780023447,"The key to ""Drunken Angel"" is the two main characters, both flawed and somewhat nobel.  Mifune is Matsunaga, a powerful gangster coming to grips with his own weakness.  He has tuberculosis.  Shimura plays Dr. Sanada, a good hearted doctor who's weakness for alcohol has left him in the lower depths of society.  When Mifune arrives to be treated for a gunshot wound, Shimura sees something in him, and attempts to treat him for his TB.
This uneasy friendship, and the balance of the two characters as they get to know each other, is the strength of ""Drunken Angel.""  Both performances are gripping.  The plot involving a gang boss released from jail,  allows the two characters to develop with each other.  The direction is tight and controlled.
This is easily a masterpiece, from one of cinema's greatest directors.",1004572800,2,816,4.905109489051095

7789659,5,0780023447,"Akira Kurosawa's marvelous 1948 social problem movie, Drunken Angel has to be seen for many reasons. Most clearly, it is the film where the director finds the trademark metaphysical style which informs all his best work to come. He said: 'In this picture I was finally myself. I was doing it and nobody else'. This was a reaction to restraints that had been placed on him by Toho studio in his first seven films and an expression of a new found freedom, but it is obvious that he would probably never have found his mature means of expression without the help of screenwriter, Keinosuke Uekusa and (most importantly) the actor Toshiro Mifune who was making the first of 16 films for him. It was Mifune's larger than life portrayal of the gangster Matsunaga that pushed the director and his writer into a series of re-writes to make Takashi Shimura's main character Dr. Sanada more substantial and stop Mifune from walking away with the film. Mifune's dynamism remains the thing audiences remember most, but looked at closely the film is actually remarkable for its balanced and deeply affecting dissection of post-war Japanese society represented as a huge toxic pond around which people scratch out their daily lives. These people fall victim to local gangsters, one of which (Matsunaga) drops into Dr. Sanada's surgery with a bullet wound. While treating his patient he finds Matsunaga has TB and advises that if he doesn't change his life-style he will die. What follows is the story of the love-hate relationship between these two men. The doctor can't stand gangsters and the gangster despises doctors, but they both have what the other needs. The gangster has his sickness which the doctor needs to cure to give his life meaning while the doctor has physical health which the gangster needs to save face and 'be a man' in the criminal society he inhabits. They both hate and resent each other because they are reminded of their own weaknesses when they meet. A recognition of their own faults reflected in someone else is something neither can abide. And yet there is love and sympathy there as well. Sanada is drawn to Matsunaga because he sees his younger self in the gangster. To cure Matsunaga is to cure himself as both are fundamentally sick (Matsunaga with TB, Sanada with alcoholism).

The title of the film could refer to either character and as the narrative progresses we see they are both angels after a fashion. Sanada may be a washed up alcoholic, but his mission to seek out and cure sickness keeps him pure and alive. For Matsunaga, he has to give up his lifestyle as a no-good gangster, which he eventually does in a very moving way which Kurosawa allows us to see, even if it remains hidden from the doctor. Kurosawa/Uekusa avoid black and white stereotyping by ensuring both characters remain realistically grey. They are a mixture of good and bad qualities just like the rest of us. In the profundity of this relationship we have the crux of all the major Kurosawa themes that will be explored in the films that follow. Dostoyevsky was the director's favorite writer and the short novel, The Double would appear to be upper-most in Kurosawa's mind here as two characters meet themselves in the form of other people and are profoundly effected by the encounter. This doubling will crop up again in Stray Dog (1949), High and Low (1963) and the much later Kagemusha (1980). Drunken Angel also marks the first mature statement of the master-pupil dialectic which will inform most of the films that follow, especially Seven Samurai (1954) - again with Mifune and Shimura. Then there is the metaphysical speculation of what it means to be a man, how to live, how to make one's life rewarding. For the doctor curing sickness is everything. For the gangster the renunciation of a whole way of life becomes his life's goal, even if it necessitates the ultimate self-sacrifice. These metaphysics find even more profound expression in the later Ikiru (1953).

The complex fascinating themes of the scenario find ample reflection in Kurosawa's carefully worked out mise-en-scene. With cinematographer Takeo Ito he makes splendid use of mirrors and reflections, most trenchantly of all, in shots of the poisonous sump which laps around the doctor's clinic and the surrounding community. Much use is made of a guitar player whose sad song sets the mood of the film. The song he plays is altered abruptly to mark the end of Matsunaga's criminal hold over the area when his former boss, Okada (a very effective Reisaburo Yamamoto) returns from prison and starts playing things to his own tune. The most effective moment of reflection (in both senses of the word) comes at the time when Matsunaga has just turned a corner. He has decided to give up drinking, has taken a flower from a stall and is looking at the pond contemplating a bright future. The camera observes his reflection in the pond's scummy surface only to see it eclipsed by the shadow of Okada. His future isn't so bright after all, a point made by the flower being tossed into the pond only to sink into the pollution. Matsunaga goes on to lose everything he has - his criminal code of honor, his girl, his money, even the room where he lives. In body he stays very much the gangster, a point made in the final fight between him and Okada where both get covered in white paint making it difficult to tell them apart, but the spirit of the man is a different story as shown in the door bursting open to see laundry fluttering in the breeze. In this moment Matsunaga attains grace. Thematically profound, visually precise and acted superbly (both Shimura and Mifune are sensational here), Drunken Angel is a classic. Anachronisms such as an unnecessary floor show, a fantastical Dreyer-inflected dream sequence and the occasional feeling of style getting the better of content prevent the film from being a masterpiece, but it is a stunningly assured premonition of greater things to come in the string of masterpieces that would stud the 1950s and finish with Redbeard (1965). It's no coincidence that this last film also features a doctor in another parable about a sick society, and that this turned out to be Mifune's last film for Kurosawa. Cut adrift from the studio system that sustained him for 20 years and robbed of his main star (the reasons for the break-up between the two remains a mystery to this day), Kurosawa would never again recapture the awe-inspiring quality of the years 1948-1965.

This region 2 BFI release is very good on the whole, the transfer (aspect ratio - 1.33:1) very sharp except for a slight blurring during the dream sequence. There are no extras on the disc except for general biographies of Kurosawa, Mifune and Shimura. The disc does come with a little leaflet with useful notes by Philip Kemp, Jay Leyda and by Kurosawa himself. The presentation is hardly Masters of Cinema standard, but it is better than most releases. The film is a must-have for any Kurosawa collection.",1411430400,,6988,4.821666666666666
7789660,3,0780023447,"Film = barely three stars; restoration = 3-1/2 stars.  Ignoring the background struggle that apparently went on with occupation censors two years into the occupation (circa 1947), and focusing  just on the film's surface merits: there is not  much here for viewers who are not interested in Japanese filmatic and/or cultural history.  It's a pot boiler with the Director attempting  (among other things) to show what it might have been like at the time to be a medical doctor involved with yakuza members at the bottom of the food chain.  The plot is centered on pride/stubbornness vs. medical dictates.  Of historical interest are the era dance hall sets and the depiction of class structure among ""ladies of the evening"" during the occupation.  The script is confusing (perhaps on purpose for safety's sake?) when alluding to the contemporary yakuza hierarchy.  Restoration could have been better if wear lines were removed (a fairly simple process using a digital master).  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1403308800,,999,5.1875
7789661,3,0780023447,"I'm not reviewing the movie here, just the dvd quality of the Mei Ah release for those that are interested ( it's blue, has Chinese script and a cheesy picture of a young Toshir Mifune and Michiyo Kogure on the cover). Bottom line, you get what you pay for. If this is one of your favorite Kurosawa movies, then forego the frustration and pay the extra money to get the Criterion edition because you'll be disappointed with this copy. The transfer source is a worn print, so don't expect a clean picture with good contrast; it's actually quite faded. The English subtitles are just brutal in spots. If you've ever amused yourself on google by translating an English sentence into Italian, then to German, then back to English and watched what comes out, then you have an idea of what I'm talking about. This is the first time I've ever found subtitles to be so distracting to the viewing of a movie that I wanted to turn them off. English had to be at least a 4th language for whoever translated this. The regrettable part is that the badly mangled text hints at what must be some cleverly nuanced dialogue exchanges in the original Japanese, especially between the doctor and the Mifune character.
These problems aside, it's still a Kurosawa movie and how can you go wrong with that? If you came across this on your cable station late at night you'd be happy. Just know that this is what you're getting when you buy this copy.",1399766400,3,1427,4.556420233463035

It tells the story of an alcoholic doctor in post WWII Tokyo who strikes up an unlikely friendship with a gangster he's treating for TB. The gangster's life is crumbling around him as he is battling the illness, leading up to a thrilling climax and a brilliantly executed dream sequence that really took my breath away.

The DVD has some excellent special features, including two documentaries about Kurosawa's challenges making the film, and how film critics place this film in the Kurosawa oeuvre. Thank you Criterion Collection, for making this a release in your catalog!
