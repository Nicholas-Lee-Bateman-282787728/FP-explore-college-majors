3985938,5,B002TQKL66,"This very early film about the Holocaust was shot at Auschwitz two years after the war ended. It was written and directed by a Polish woman--a filmmaker who survived the infamous death camp. So, the film she and her crew produced is closer to a historical artifact than a typical Hollywood movie about the era. Tragically, until now, the movie was virtually unknown in the U.S. because it was produced in Poland--in Polish and German--during the period when the Soviet Union was consolidating power over Poland.

As a journalist with a long-standing interest in reporting on the legacy of the Holocaust, I had heard of the film's existence, but never expected to see it. Now, Facets has brought a DVD with English subtitles to the U.S.

There is almost no biographical material easily accessible about writer-director Wanda Jakubowska in English, not even in the DVD liner notes. In 1949, when the film briefly landed in New York, the Times' Bosley Crowther described it as: ""a grim and shattering reminder of the terrible, ghastly deeds which were done under the bestial regime of the Nazis in their huge concentration-slaughter camps.""

""The Last Stage"" is just as shattering today. Because it was produced in Poland in 1947, the film reflects the dominant Soviet interpretation of the Holocaust after World War II--that this genocide was aimed broadly at minorities by the Fascists in Germany. The film includes several target groups, including Jews and ""Gypsies"" among others. So, the film is not a historically accurate look at the overall nature of the Holocaust in the 1930s and 1940s as we understand it today.

But that really wasn't the point of the movie. Clearly, Wanda and her crew were obsessed with setting down on film an unforgettable memoir of life in Auschwitz. They deliberate shot it in the remains of the camp within 2 years of its liberation.

How Wanda and her crew were able to return to the site of such cruelty and mass murder seems amazing in itself. Apparently, they poured their trauma into these 105 minutes of cinema. The film's greatest value is the stark clarity of Wanda's memories. Mostly, she recalls what must have been indelible details. You'll not soon forget her sequence of a transport train arriving on a foggy night with silhouettes of armed guards hemming in the terrified people spilling from the cattle cars.

Thanks to Facets for bringing us an important Holocaust artifact, lost to American viewers for too many years.",1266192000,23,2467,4.946859903381642

8380557,5,B002TQKL66,"An important and historic film that deserves to be reproducted better, but still well worth seeing.  Last Stage was directed and co-written by Wanda Jakubowska in 1947 just two years after WWII had ended and tells of her experiences and of those around her in Auschwitz.  Amazingly it is filmed in Auschwitz and the Polish actor and actresses actually sleep in the barracks while the movie was being filmed and wore the actual prision uniforms that had been sanitized but still were stained with blood, etc.  In my opinion it is a must see, even though the quality of the reproduction is poor.",1483574400,2,593,4.737864077669903
8380558,3,B002TQKL66,"A remarkable film, all the more extraordinary for its depiction of the events of the Holocaust  so soon after the end of the war. The choreography of the large crowd scenes and the nightmarish, surreal shots of smoke and dark sky are masterful, cinematic painting of the highest order.

This great film, though, deserves a high quality restoration. And if no one is willing to do that, it at least deserves a minimal cleaning up beyond the very poor of quality of this DVD.  This is simply a video of an extremely degraded print. The elaborate cover art seems to suggest that something was done to make it  more watchable, but the DVD is horrible.

Having said that, the importance of this film is such that there are still film scholars, Holocaust historians, and others who are just now discovering it, who will want to see it in ANY condition. I just wish that Polart Video would include some kind of warning about the abysmal quality of the print. If you want or need to see this film, need the English subtitles,  do not care at all about video quality, and are willing to pay  $20 for poor quality, go for it.

But if you know the film already and are looking for  a copy that has any improvements or cleaning up at all, do not buy it. It is horrible.

The only value added here are the subtitles, which unfortunately are occasionally very awkward and sometimes simply wrong. Obviously, I am referring to awkward English since I don't  speak or read Polish.

The legendary Wanda Jakubowska  deserves better. This simply should not be sold without a warning. If and when Polart Video  produces a quality reproduction, I  look forward to checking it out.",1441411200,3,1658,4.591836734693878

8380563,3,B002TQKL66,"As a trainload of Jews arrives at Auschwitz, the Obersturmbannfhrer commandant notices one of the ""passengers,"" Marta Weiss (Basia Drapinska), translating his directives for the others and decides to utilize her. Meanwhile, in one of the camp's infirmary barracks, the women struggle to survive. A newborn baby is taken from its mother, Helena (Wanda Bartowna), and murdered. The guards and kapos deal savagely with their charges. Sickness and death abound in the treacherous conditions while only a short distance away flames, smoke, and ash incessantly billow out of the crematorium smokestacks. Yet there is also camaraderie amongst the women who are heartened by occasional reports of the Allies' advances.

Marta is drawn into a communist resistance group within the camp which uncovers the Nazis' plans to murder all the prisoners as the Red Army approaches. She escapes the camp to deliver the German strategy to the Polish communist underground but is arrested and tortured. As she awaits her execution the sky is filled with Allied bombers on their way to German targets which portends the inevitable victory over fascism.

The Last Stage (Ostatni etap) (1948) is significant as one of the very first films that dealt with the horrors of the Holocaust. A large portion of the movie was actually filmed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The actors lived in actual camp barracks and dressed in the authentic striped prisoner garb that, although disinfected, still contained blood stains. The director and co-writer of the film, Wanda Jakubowska, was herself a camp survivor. The crew and cast are largely Polish including many extras from the nearby town of Oswiecim. German prisoners of war were also used in the filming. Lovely actresses Barbara Drapinska and Wanda Bartowna give wonderful performances. Beautiful Baltic blond, Barbara Fijewska, is simply breathtaking as Anielka.

Unfortunately, the quality of the film is very poor. The picture is grainy and much of the production is amateurish by Hollywood standards. Many of the grimmest aspects of camp existence were referenced only vaguely in consideration of theater audiences. The English subtitling for this DVD is atrocious with many misspellings and mistranslations.

Make no mistake, The Last Stage is a blatant Soviet propaganda piece. Poland was controlled by the Soviets when this movie was produced so Stalin and the Red Army are presented in a heroic and messianic fashion. Stalin personally approved the film's script in which committed Marxist Jakubowska portrays several non-communist Polish characters in a decidedly negative manner. At the very same time this movie was being filmed the Soviets were using several Auschwitz sub-camps as internment centers for Polish nationalists. For Poland the two-edged Soviet ""cure"" was as nearly as deadly as the Nazi ""disease."" The reality that Auschwitz was primarily a camp used to exterminate Jews is somewhat obscured in deference to the standard Soviet narrative which referenced victims' national membership over ethnicity. The film claims 4.5 million people died at Auschwitz while current estimates put the number at 1.5 million with around 90 percent of those being Jewish. While all communist characters are depicted as selfless and heroic, Germans are caricatured as complete grotesques.

The Last Stage is valuable because it was the first movie to examine the horror of a Nazi concentration/extermination camp and because it was filmed at Auschwitz-Birkenau only a few years after the Nazi atrocities ended. But it's outrageous that anyone would award five stars to this brazenly propagandistic piece of Soviet-sponsored Socialist Realism.
