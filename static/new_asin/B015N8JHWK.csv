8733997,4,B015N8JHWK,"To the numerous critics who found this work speech-y, let me offer my condolences that you have evidently not seen a single one of Ken Loach's 20-something previous (brilliant) movies. Speechiness is something that one always encounters in Loachland. The observation is unnecessary, like calling Rohmer talky.

It may be worth noting that while many of Loach's previous films could be described as grainy or gritty or could most charitably be labeled as cinma vrit, this beauty is utterly gorgeous in HD, with every shot locked down and every leaf or tree-needle in stable focus. What's more, we get a glimpse of a part of the world rarely seen in the movies: County Leitrim, Ireland. It is a location previously known as a punch-line for James Joyce, and as an entire universe of humanity for novelist John McGahern.

This movie hints at answering the question, Why does Irish dance look so happy from the waist down, and so sad from the waist up? It grapples with the fact that institutionalized religion often rejects politics that actually align with Christian teachings. Finally, it poses the question of whether joy, in whatever form it presents, can ever be truly oppositional to faith in God.

More so than usual, I cannot vouch for this movie for everyone. If visually stunning is enough to convince you, then you will like it. If you are a fan of Ken Loach, you will want to see what he does here. Otherwise, it's a roll of the dice. With lovely photography, precise casting and peerless direction, it is hard for me to imagine someone not liking it. But then, a quick visit to Metacritic will introduce you to folks who don't.",1448582400,4,1637,4.757042253521127
8733998,3,B015N8JHWK,"Jimmys Hall,"" based on a true story, is a cultural center in Ireland dedicated to dances, art classes, and other non-controversial ventures. Jimmy Gralton (Barry Ward) opened the hall in 1922, but on the brink of civil war and with unwanted attention from the church and other politicians, he is forced to flee and the hall to close. To avoid arrest, Jimmy travels to New York, where he remains for ten years. Returning in 1932, Jimmy sees that the hall has fallen into disrepair. Encouraged by old friends, he determines to reopen the once popular venue, but finds that old hostilities are still very much alive. Father Sheridan (Jim Norton) is his primary opponent.

This clergyman regards the hall as a center of sin and depravity. Jimmy must face small-town attitudes and the fear that he is fostering communism through the planned use of the hall as a meeting place of ordinary folks. He turns activist crusader when he sees the widespread poverty and growing cultural oppression in his old hometown.

If the plot sounds like that of the movie Footloose, there are similarities, but Jimmys Hall is far more political in nature. Theres a David vs. Goliath theme that portrays Jimmy as the popular underdog in a largely Catholic community in which the Church is a powerful, intimidating force.

Director Ken Loach sets up the period effectively and portrays Jimmy as a Capra-esque crusader awakened to the needs of his community. Ward plays Jimmy as a more worldly counterpart of his fellow townsfolk. He has, after all, spent a decade in New York.

Bonus extra on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, commentary with Barry Ward, and a making-of featurette.",1447459200,5,1667,4.92170818505338
