Judging by the picture on the front of this product, I was misled into believing that is was related to the claymation Wind in the Willows series. When I played the DVD I was dismayed to see that it features a concert which was apparently shot in Germany. The characters from the series never make an appearance. It was supposed to be a collection of songs from the series. The songs that were played by the musicians were completely unrecognizable and the film quality was something that you might expect from someone making a home video. Upon closer inspection, I found that the DVD case was most likely manufactured using a home computer. The picture actually a hodgepodge of Wind in the Willows images that have been cut and pasted onto a different background. Do not be fooled into purchasing this item!!",1270512000,11,914,4.545454545454546
