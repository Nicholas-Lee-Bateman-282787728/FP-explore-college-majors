8332961,5,B001PBSWZI,"Just what Dark Ride fans have been waiting for.  A professionally done video going behind the scenes at one of the world best dark rides.  Except for the largest theme and amusement parks, Dark Rides are a dying breed, especially the classic ones.  This is a WELCOME look behind the scenes of one of America's best dark rides from yesterday/today.  With footage of every trick and gag along the way, in detail, and then a complete circuit of the ride with the lights off as usual, and then with the lights on so that you can see the details in real time.  Our expert DAFE.org curators interview folks from the park who know this ride, including one of the designers, long time ride operators and maintenance lead, as well as the current owner of the amusement park.  Fantastic.  If enough folks enjoy and buy videos like this, maybe more can be put together by the Darkride And Funhouse Enthusiasts.",1302739200,3,899,4.616352201257862
