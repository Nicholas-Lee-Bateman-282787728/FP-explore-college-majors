7735012,5,B01EGQAHFG,I've had this workout in the past. It's excellent! Glad I found it so reasonable on Amazon .com. Thank you!,1398816000,,107,4.4
7735013,5,B01EGQAHFG,"It's great for the female body. It targets all of my problem areas. Hopefully I can lose the evidence of my first 2 babies before I destroy my body again with another one. Even then, I will use Slim in 6 to get everything back together.",1394841600,3,236,4.1521739130434785
7735014,5,B01EGQAHFG,"I originally lost around 50 pounds when I was a teenager from using slim in 6.  Now after having 2 children I'm using it again.  If it aint broken don't fix it!  When I lost that weight, it was the first time I had ever lost that many pounds.  I was overweight and these videos were definitely a challenge at first, but after every workout I felt better about myself.  I found that if I started the workout and would not quit it, but if I didn't put that video in...i would go days without working out.  Good luck!!! Highly recommend...but go at your own pace!",1390348800,7,560,4.235849056603773
7735015,5,B01EGQAHFG,I am working on the start it up! phase of the video and getting a great workout.  My husband is much farther advanced and used the ramp it up! section and says it is a great workout.  Debbie is very encouraging about going at your own pace and she shows alternate moves if the one she is doing is too difficult.  Really appreciate the encouragement~,1389657600,4,349,4.338461538461538
7735016,4,B01EGQAHFG,"Bought this when it first came out but stored it away in a closet. I recently decided to exercise again. I pulled the Slim 6 DVD set out of my closet and dusted it off. The works ARE effective. Any workout is. But I like the format of Debbie's series. I enjoy the easy to follow movements. As I get older, I'm less ambitious about impressive choreography or newfangled moves that only athletes can manage. This works great if you're looking for an easy-to-follow but effective routine. Like any program, though, you have to stick with it.",1458259200,,538,4.556701030927835
7735017,1,B01EGQAHFG,I just received my DVD package and only one DVD was in the DVD box. The Disc Two is missing. I would like to get the second DVD.  Please advise.,1457049600,,144,3.8

7735019,5,B01EGQAHFG,"I have only been doing this video for three weeks now, but I am already seeing results.  I am anxious to see if this workout actually corrects my ""muffin top"".  I have almost given up on this area, but I have already lost 4 inches.  It is a hard workout, but the way she instructs the workout, the time flies by.",1455753600,2,312,4.081967213114754

7735023,3,B01EGQAHFG,"The presenter does not allow for transition between different workouts, which makes it difficult to keep up.  Rewinding and so forth just is a hassle and makes the workout longer. However, if I were to stick with it, I am sure that I would get a good workout.  A friend used the DVD and followed it continuously and really saw results.",1451520000,,335,4.475409836065574
7735024,5,B01EGQAHFG,"This is our second set. The second DVD in the first set went missing so we reordered after finding no good replacement.  The exercises are easy to modify, if you need to, love how it is broken up in the sections and the timer.  I don't mind that it is almost an hour long.  I do what I can fit in on busy days, using the sections to make sure it is a good workout. My runner husband uses it for his snow day workout and it kicks his butt and gives him nice abs.",1447804800,,461,3.831578947368421

7735026,4,B01EGQAHFG,This replaced my original Slim in 6. There's just one area where it seems to freeze but not enough to be upset about. All in all I'm satisfied.,1444694400,,143,4.142857142857143

7735031,5,B01EGQAHFG,"These videos kicked my ass! I don't workout really hard usually but this was a good way to start working out again. It is enjoyable, except I don't like how some of the videos are pretty long, when I want to do some stretching or other things that may not be in one video so it takes a lot longer than I'd like to do a full workout because I need to play another video.",1435017600,3,369,3.933333333333333
7735032,5,B01EGQAHFG,This DVD provides a good workout and she does a good job preparing you for each move.,1433289600,,85,4.0588235294117645
7735033,3,B01EGQAHFG,"I like this series and have numerous Slim in 6 DVD's, BUT, they did not work for me,  the way I wanted them to!  I was trying to get rid of the menopause middle and decided to try this series!  I did the Slim in 6, Ramp it Up, Keep it Up and did not get the results I wanted! I was also riding bikes for an hour a day at least 4 times a week!  I am a very petite person and DO NOT have a weight issue!  I did not lose any weight however, the Ramp it Up and Keep it up did give me tremendous stamina for the bike riding!",1430784000,2,519,3.5575221238938055
7735034,5,B01EGQAHFG,"I first bought this DVD when I was in college and did all 6 weeks. I looked the best I ever did! I still go back to it every so often. I love this workout because it's not high impact so I don't have to jump around in my apartment and worry about making noise.
The first 2 weeks is a 25-30 minute workout. I never work up a huge sweat doing this workout but MAN you feel it the next day!! I love that this can help make some great sculpted changes in your body as long as you stick to the program! I would highly recommend this workout to anyone looking to tighten and tone, especially their lower body and abs!",1429747200,2,611,3.975609756097561

7735041,5,B01EGQAHFG,Love this workout video!  Easy moves that provide great results.  The disc go from beginners to experienced.  I especially like the Slim & Limber (stretch video) and the Slim & 6pack  (abs workout) that are included.,1417564800,2,216,4.916666666666667

7735054,4,B01EGQAHFG,"I just completed the first day of this video at home. It is a GREAT workout and my muscles are already sore...not looking forward to tomorrow. Here's what I like and don't like:

PROS:
-You do a lot of legs, arms, and abs. I feel like these are evenly spaced and balanced. Feel the burn!
-It gets your heart rate up!
-It is low impact. I have bad knees and there are very few exercises in this video that made my knees uncomfortable, but I still felt like my muscles got a good workout.
-It incorporates dynamic stretches/warm-ups at the beginning and slow, relaxing stretches at the end including yoga poses to increase stretch and flexibility.

CONS:
-It's almost an hour long. If you want, you could skip the yoga at the end and shorten it to make it like 45 minutes long. I think this may impact whether or not busy professionals can stick with this program for 6 weeks. However, I think it's a much more comprehensive workout than going an doing the elliptical at the gym for 45 minutes.
-I recommend buying elastic resistance bands and a yoga mat (yes, even if you're doing your workout on carpet). There are several exercises where you are on all fours or on your back and that began to hurt (even on the carpet). They use elastic resistance bands for arms, but I think you could also use small hand weights.

Overall, I think this is an excellent workout at home. Debbie Siebers is calming and mostly quiet (you don't have someone gabbing at you the whole time--I'm looking at you Jillian) and the music is quiet and is not abnoxious.",1400025600,13,1542,4.480427046263345
7735055,5,B01EGQAHFG,"I started on the first video.  It's easy to understand and follow.  I have a long way to go, so starting out at this level (I adjust my speed so that I don't strain anything even though the level is very easy) is just right.",1399852800,,224,3.9555555555555557
8758658,5,B01EGQAHFG,"Really enjoy this exercise video.  I am 64 years old, I have lower back and neck issues. Exercise videos for my age have not given me the work out I am looking for without hurting my back and neck.  This video gives me the intensity that I want without the pain.  Love the time counter, when I think I can't do anymore I see how little time I have left and push through.",1517788800,2,370,4.041095890410959
