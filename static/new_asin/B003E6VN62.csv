4113885,2,B003E6VN62,"Though the acting style was not as exaggerated or melodramatic as in many martial arts films, the superhuman feats during the fights were depressingly familiar. Jumping up three meters into the air to kick somebody simply is not humanly possible except with trick photography, smoke, and mirrors.",1288483200,,296,5.319148936170213
4113886,5,B003E6VN62,"14 Blades is a very good film. Another one of Donnie Yen,s best films. Incredible performance and a must see for Donnie Yen fans.",1284768000,5,129,4.416666666666667
4113887,5,B003E6VN62,"This movie is great. I have lent it to five people and they all say the same thing, Awesome.",1280880000,9,92,3.8947368421052633
4113888,4,B003E6VN62,"This movie is definitely a cut above recent movies from Asia. Certainly it is better than Seven Swords and even the abysmal Hollywood product Forbidden Kingdom.

The trick to watching 14 Blades is to consider that this is not a wuxia epic at all - it is, first and foremost, a Western. The music is itself a clue, as it holds strains of Ennio Morricone during his collaborations with Sergio Leone. Even the protagonist is a Man with No Name, and Donnie Yen's characterization of him is an homage to Clint Eastwood.

Is it another Crouching Tiger? No, it is not. It is simply good popcorn fare as a simple self-respecting Western should be. Take it for what it is, and you will have quite an enjoyable afternoon.",1279324800,10,711,4.546875
4113889,1,B003E6VN62,"- The fighting scenes are bad. They look obviously wired because of clumsy editing. Iron Monkey's fighting scenes are much more interesting and look real due to excellent editing.

- The plot is ridiculous.

In short, there's nothing worth watching in this movie.",1278720000,2,263,5.093023255813954
4113890,2,B003E6VN62,"The fighting scenes are awsome. The story is so lame. If Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is the zenith of martial art movie, then 14 blade is mediocre. Rent it, don't buy.",1278547200,,171,4.375

4113892,2,B003E6VN62,I go to a movie to see the actor's and actresses bring the movie to life . Not read a book . I'm paying good money & I fell sorry for a family of 5 & more .

4113894,3,B003E6VN62,"It's a decent movie, probably a 3.5, but the action feels very 1990s Chinese action film. The acting is okay, and I like D Yen (see IP Man and the recent movie where he played a pseudo Jedi 2015/6).

Everything is good, from the acting to the plot, but it simply wasn't glue-me-to-the-seat action film. So...use your Prime and be entertained for free.",1509580800,,351,4.571428571428571
4113895,5,B003E6VN62,"The plot left a lot to be desired, but The fight scenes were EPIC. Besides, who watches Kung Fu movies for plot anyway? LOVED this movie...will watch again.",1509408000,,156,4.607142857142857
4113896,5,B003E6VN62,"This movie didn't even make any sense.  It was preposterous in almost every way.  A+ Will watch again.

I recommend looking for continuity problems and new characters introduced for no reason as a drinking game.  You won't make it to the end.",1509062400,,242,4.690476190476191

4113905,5,B003E6VN62,"Despite the trailer making it seem like this movie is all chop, slice, and dice, it has a romantic streak running through it that is pleasantly and humorously surprising. The movie has a slick style to it that makes it stand apart from the usual period drama/assassin fare. The heroine also really stands out from other films, neither a martial arts expert nor weak & helpless but capable and intelligent and a match in wits to the hero without showing him up. The second half of the film lacks tightness and tension but is still worth watching.",1483660800,,545,4.628865979381444

4113918,5,B003E6VN62,"Daniel Lee stuck gold with this movie.  I love Donnie Yen in almost everything he's cast in and this is no exception.  He is so brilliant in his craft, he makes the battles look effortless.  I thought the pairing of Quinglong and Qiao Hua  would have made a happy ending, but Mr. Yen leaves broken hearts wherever he goes.  His fate was sealed as soon as the betrayal happened.  The battle scenes were spectacular and the main actors and actresses had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Even though I watch these movies with subtitles, the little nuances in the facial expressions, the way they carry themselves throughout the movie and all the twists and turns of the story with or without fight scenes, I know exactly what's happening every moment of this movie.

4113927,5,B003E6VN62,"This a good movie. I am a Donnie Yen fan. The concept is a little over my head but, that's why I have to watch it a few more times to really get it.
I'm not giving the plot away when I say that his mantra as squad leader to a group of assassins was that one day he would die and he has accepted that as his faith. Well the ending of the movie shocked the daylights out of me. Throughout the movie, because he has been falsely accused and stripped of his rank and sentenced to death, he escapes death, and as a result the league of assassins from the emperor are out to end his life, and thus, the story revolves around their inability to do and his trying to clear his name. There is a very skillful female assassin who is the daughter of the  emperor and she comes very closes to success in her attempts to kill him. With this in mind the ending is shocking and brilliant and could not have ending any other way for eternity to be satisfied. I was surprised it was pretty good for a period piece. They really do a really great job all round with the putting this movie together. Maximum martial arts yet, there appeared to me to be no sloppiness, no haphazard oh that could never happen stuff. Saying that, there is some flying and gravity defying movements but I found them all enjoyable and fun to watch. So get it if you like historic martial arts and Donnie Yen. you can't go wrong he works really hard to give you a good movie.",1440288000,2,1433,4.154676258992806

Within the product details it states that the language is in English (as well as dubbed English).  However, it is NOT in English (not even an option in set up).  This dvd is strictly Mandarin Chinese language.  Now, to some this may not be an issue, but I always check the language and region first before a dvd purchase (lesson learned in the past).  For me, when watching a martial arts film, an action film, or any type of film...my preference is to enjoy the film without having to constantly take my eyes away from the action/visual effects to read (pause...rewind...what I miss?).",1439942400,4,610,4.726415094339623

4113954,2,B003E6VN62,"I have a friend who studied and got a brown belt and his butt kicked by a 12-year-old. He is, nevertheless, a martial arts movie nut. He is also learning disabled in reading, and I have low vision, so watching this movie with him was quite a challenge for us--and therefore not very entertaining. To me, in the modern world of automatic weapons, martial arts and martial arts movies are total BS, anyway--especially when they include mystical, superhuman, evaporating, magical Asian people. Most importantly, if there is even a remote chance that you are going to export your movies to English-speaking nations where English-speaking viewers might buy them, then include an English langauge option. At the very least, offer a big warning on the cover so that readers know in advance that they are about to read a ridiculous movie.",1413590400,,830,4.935714285714286
4113955,3,B003E6VN62,Donnie Yen is Amazing but the director decided the story needed cheese wired stunts. This cheapened some fight scenes.,1413331200,,118,5.2631578947368425
4113956,5,B003E6VN62,"I love Donnie Yen so I knew I would be checking this one out...At first I didn't think I would like it, but it moved at a pretty quick pace and you got drawn into the story line. It's a story of orphaned children who are made into killer assassins at an early age... well the main character (Donnie Yen) is the best of the best and is sent on an assignment only to find out that  if he carried out his assignment it would have a huge impact on the country so he decides to not go through with it and is hunted down from his own comrades, along the way he meets some interesting people!  I usually don't care for the ""villains"" in a movie of this type, but oh my goodness! Tou Tou (female villain) is really a show stopper in this one- I wanted to know more about her character (which puts you in mind of a mortal combat character).

4113960,4,B003E6VN62,"It seems to me that most ""martial arts"" movies have at least three things in common:  (1) someone has been falsely accused of something and must save their honor; (2) there is always some sort of love romance gone wrong; and (3) everybody dies.  14 Blades, however, is a step above most movies of its genre.  This tells a tale of a man with a troubled past trying to do what is right.  There is action galore and the acting was a step WAAAAAY above what the viewer will usually find in one of these movies.  The cinematography was georgous and so was the art direction.  And who doesn't love (wire) kung fu?

The movie is rated R for violence.  It also makes for some very good entertainment.  Recommended.  ALERT:  This movie is Mandrin (subtitled in English).  You will also need to be a pretty fast reader to keep up!",1410825600,,820,4.3933333333333335

4113990,5,B003E6VN62,One of his best movies yet. The lady villian is super and his love interest is unforgettable. The action is non-stop and mind-blowing. I've watched it so many times and I'm still awed!,1363737600,,184,4.606060606060606
4113991,4,B003E6VN62,"My wife is Chinese, so I buy a lot of the mandarin speaking with English subtitles movies.  This was an enjoyable movie with lots of action.  I personally like the Donnie Yen movies better than many of these type of movies.  This one had a good plot, good action, and good acting.",1362096000,10,280,4.346153846153846
4113992,4,B003E6VN62,"Donnnie Yen has some good fight scenes in this movie, and the action keeps going.  The story also keeps your interest.  The female killer looks good.",1357776000,,149,4.6923076923076925
4113993,4,B003E6VN62,"I felt moved to comment on this film even though truthfully I've only seen the first half hour of it so far. Why so impulsive, you ask? Because I think Donnie Yen is a national treasure and demands a degree of respect that I plan to demonstrate by example. This is a carefully and beautifully photographed film and obviously no expense was spared. Donnie looks gorgeous here and isn't that a positive PLUS on this film's side? We all know he is a martial arts master, we need no more proof than his previous body of work. All we need here is to sit back and watch his balletic moves and sinuous skills in showing once again that Chinese martial arts are the classical ballet of certain demise. And I haven't even SEEN Wu Chun yet, who is certainly one of the most watchable flower boy stars in Asia at the moment, in addition to which, the child can MOVE second to none and if not an actual martial arts master like Mr Yen, he can certainly do a bang-up imitation of one. [See: ""Butterfly Lovers"" - another unsung yet delightful offering that I have seen innumerable times and will now be sending to a dear friend so she can similarly thrill to its wonderfulness.]

My advice: forget the comparisons to ""Crouching Tiger"" (for me this film more closely resembles ""The Banquet"") and watch this film. I think you're going to like it.",1339027200,3,1330,4.473251028806584
4113994,5,B003E6VN62,"I'm a big Yen fan and always enjoy seeing most of his movies. First let me say the dvd looks great. The picture is very sharp and detailed, I can't really see any reason to buy the bluray version. I also thoght it was well acted especially the women in the movie. The action parts were great even with the wire parts. Hey its an action movie and doesn't really overdo the wire stuff. I think you'll enjoy Yen and all the action.",1328313600,6,428,4.168674698795181
4113995,4,B003E6VN62,"I like this movie a lot because Director Daniel Lee has done a good job combining jaw-dropping kung-fu actions, in-depth character studies, Western style of episonage, and Chinese style of loyalty and filial piety all in one moive.

Though the audience may not have problems identifying whom the good and bad guys are in this movie, one can't help being sympathetic to the bad guys sometimes because everybody was performing his/her duty with such a fervent and undying devotion to the person, political idealism, professional ethics that each loved and belonged to.",1326067200,,566,5.1521739130434785
4113996,3,B003E6VN62,"From all the reviews that I read above me seems like no one knows that 14 Blades is a Shaw Brothers remake of the 1984 movie Secret Service of Imperial Court directed by Tony Liu Jun Guk.

Now that I got that out of the way the modern version 14 blades is directed by mostly hit or miss Daniel Lee. His credits include Black Mask,What Price Survival,Three Kingdoms Ressurection of the Dragon,Star Runner Aka Kumite,Dragon Squad aka Dragon Heat and the upcoming Wuxia White Vengeance. As you can see from those credits most people that have seen his movies only Black Mask and What Price Survival were their favorites.

The cast includes both new actors old school Kung Fu actors from the Shaw Brothers era like Chen Kwan Tai,Wu Ma,Lam Chi Tai,Fung Hak On. From Golden Harves of course Sammo Hung which has only a supporting part and does not lay a finger on nobody,Duel to the Death's Damian Lau (if you blinked you missed him because i don't even remember him being in it).Wu Chun who looks like a pretty boy Asian Jack Sparrow,Vicky Zhao Whei,and Donnie Yen filling up for Leung Kar Yan aka Beardy.

The Cinematography is nice too look at as well as the special effects. Donnie Yen barely saves this movie and the supporting cast seems to be weak and not backing him up at all. There is both some wire fu and some good fighting scenes in this movie but unless you're a Donnie Yen fan this one is an Ok movie better than Three Kingdoms but not better than its rivals like Ip Man movies and True Legend by Yuen Woo Ping. Watch the Original it is 10 times better and did not need wire fu or GGI to make it a good movie.",1316217600,26,1618,4.368770764119601

4114001,4,B003E6VN62,"Occidental Western script influence, more Ford than spaghetti, with consistent performances.  More talented weapons use, and CG support then just wire work.  Traces of scenes from ""Hero"" and characters from ""CTHD"" that do not distract from the focal struggle between the blades and the evil shroud.  Solid entertainment, worthy of several viewings.",1289865600,24,348,5.653846153846154

It was nice to see it in HD this time around, but my memory must be playing tricks on me, because this 'version' seemed harder to follow plotwise. It's as though short scenes that tied up the plotlines and who is who more cohesively has been edited out.  Whether or not this is true, you'll get the gist of what's going on if you stick with it. And, my wife cried at the end, so it must be a good movie.
