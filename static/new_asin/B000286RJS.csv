8023402,4,B000286RJS,"These films are not from the ""finest elements"" as advertised.  Lady Gangster looks best with minimal problems.  They Made Me a Criminal, from a well-used print, is quite disappointing but still quite watchable.  Both films are complete.  Since these are both WB pictures, the only hope for a better print of ""Criminal"" in particular will be the Warner Archive(although I have mixed feelings on those).",1328659200,2,401,5.123076923076923
8023403,3,B000286RJS,"ROAN boasts these movies are re-mastered from the best possible sources but when i saw the poor quality of the print i was very disappointed. The print of lady gangster is better, both of which are decent movies. I recently saw ""Criminal"" on Turner Classic Movies and the print was exceptional. why couldn't ROAN use that print? you get what you pay for.",1109894400,9,354,4.634920634920635
