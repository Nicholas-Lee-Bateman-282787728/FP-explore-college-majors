7930576,5,B00005421D,"I added a comment to the other review a while back and thought I might as well add a quick word here as a review.

I just wanted to let y'all know that it is currently selling on the English branch of Amazon: that's Amazon-uk (instead of Amazon.com).

By the way, you should always check the European branches, when you can't find it here, or to compare prices, you may find better choice sometimes - they are: Amazon-uk (England), -Fr (France), -DE (Germany)...

HOWEVER, this video is in European format (Region 2 PAL), not American. You will need compatible equipment, or ask your seller or a company to make you a transfer to American format (Region 1NTSC).

I'm rating 5 stars for the film; however, the tape itself will play like a video tape...an old video, quite less neat than digital ! We are no longer used to this grainy quality, so be warned. Also, it's from the Odyssey brand, a small company I believe, whose videos are sometimes not of the best visual quality. The sound is fine.",1441670400,3,995,4.5418994413407825
7930577,4,B00005421D,"I have a copy of this movie with Oprah Winfrey on a vhs tape where it was copied from regular TV. I'm now planning to buy this movie as a new used copy and as the real deal, so I can see it well and clear with no tracking. Because the copy that I already have is like that with tracking and fuzziness. So I would be really be happy to buy back this movie to see it like I've never seen it before and transfer it on DVD off of my vcr combo with a DVD recorder, so that the VHS tape doesn't ware out. And I have to say that this was a good movie with Oprah Winfrey from 1993, and it's a rare movie that you can't find nowhere.",1422230400,4,624,3.734848484848485
