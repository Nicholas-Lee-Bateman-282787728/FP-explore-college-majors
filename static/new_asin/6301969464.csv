390239,4,6301969464,"This film caught my eye on TCM immediately because of the superb cast ,cinema photography .film score. Loved premise especially equestrian theme. Shot selections outstanding .This was Tatum O'Neil's transition role to mature adult films that she could not capitalize on. Like her work in preceding films this was a role that I appreciated very much. International Velvet is a must to see and will be in my archives. Could not give it 5 stars because characters at times appeared 1 dimensional .Its a simple story that is a ""breath of fresh air ""just wanted more content and indepth characters to compliment the photography and music providing a holistic cinematic achievement .Its a good film but I wanted it to be great .I'm critical but International Velvet is a favorite movie of mine.",1411689600,,788,4.932330827067669

390283,3,6301969464,"International Velvet has some pretty good elements; decent actors, majestic landscapes, amazing horses and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.
However, there are some things I found very troublesome about this, and it's mostly about the continuity.
This was intended to be a sequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B001GMRZMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>"", but there seemed to be little connection between the two movies.

.For starters, the Pie turned from a handsome chestnut gelding to a dark bay stallion. Granted, he's still beautiful, but that's just ridiculous. Who ever heard of a gelding spontaneously getting his manhood back?

.What ever happened to Mi? He wasn't mentioned a single time. Strange; I figured Mi would be one of the least likely person Velvet wouldn't talk about to her niece, since he helped train the Pie.
Velvet's sisters (Mally and Edwina) weren't mentioned, either. Her mom, dad and her brother, Donald, were mentioned, but that's about it.

.Velvet herself seemed to have lost some of her charm. I understand that she has grown up, but this film just destroyed her innocence. She is seen sleeping with a man she isn't married to. I guess because I am a Christian this just bothers me a little. Granted, she's still human, but I feel that Velvet would be one of the last people to do this.

While this film does have a lot going for it, it seems kind of insulting to call this a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B001GMRZMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>. If this was a stand alone movie, then it might not bother me so much.
It's still a good movie, and it has the sort of charm only the older films seem to have. However, I thought it would be fair to warn you that this movie pretty much throws out some of the important elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B001GMRZMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>.",1391731200,4,2080,5.877483443708609
390284,4,6301969464,"There are already enough positive reviews here, so I will keep mine brief.

Some weighty, maudlin moments aside (an inevitability of 1970s films), this is actually a reasonable ""invented sequel"" to its predecessor. This film actually feels more mature and rational than ""National Velvet"" - even if Tatum O'Neal IS a little awkward sometimes. There is still a certain flair and glimmer throughout this movie (whether this is due to the scripting or the direction is unclear). Anthony Hopkins gets a lot of the credit for leading the cast (duly deserved, don't get me wrong), but I think it's Christopher Plummer that really cements this movie together. Plummer has a consistently understated grace that seems to guide both the actors and the plot.

The story has some of the same originality as ""National Velvet"" had, so although it is fundamentally a ""girl and her horse"" story, it only rarely feels like a cliche. I do believe it was made with the utmost respect and fondness for the Bagnold novel. There are many common traps that this film avoids or (just barely) sidesteps, which makes it worth watching in my book.

P.S. - Daniel Abineri fans should take notice that he makes a fun (but fairly brief) appearance in this movie.",1384819200,,1231,4.852380952380952
390285,2,6301969464,"This movie should have been good.  I so looked forward to seeing Tatum O'Neill again.  But whatever happened to that wonderful, feisty little girl in Paper Moon and Bad News Bears?  In this movie, she is angry at the beginning, and is then transformed in an instant (at an equestrian ceremony) into an insipid young lady with a soft, fake, high voice.  Anthony Hopkins is great as always, but comes across as heavy-handed compared to Tatum, and the rest of the cast is fine.  The plot is pretty non-existent.  The horses are beautiful, and you need not fear bringing your children to this movie.  They might even enjoy it, if they can stay awake.",1384560000,,646,4.614035087719298

390287,4,6301969464,"International Velvet combines the best of classic equestrianism with a light story line. Set in England, the story centers around Velvet's orphaned American niece who develops an interest in horses and ends up in the Olympics. Well done.",1369785600,,237,5.2631578947368425

390340,5,6301969464,"I just love this movie, it's one of my all-time guilty pleasures.

Sadly it wasn't a big success upon its release in 1978, a shame because it has some great things in it - gorgeous Devonshire locations, a beautiful haunting score by Francis Lai, stunning cinematography by Tony Imi and a lovely cast - Tatum O'Neal, Christopher Plummer, Nanette Newman, Anthony Hopkins.

Although harshly reviewed at the time - most critics had a problem with the film's overt sentimentality - as a director Bryan Forbes tells his story simply and effectively. Try not to shed a tear during the aeroplane sequence or when Sarah calls her aunt and uncle ""my parents"" during the final scene - as Francis Lai's music begins to swell you'll soon be grabbing for your box of kleenex.

390343,4,6301969464,I have both National Velvet and International Velvet and both are really good movies. However some of the details of the second movie doesnt fit into the first one. Ok for instance Arizona Pie is suppose to be the Pie's son. The Pie was a gelding in the first movie. So he couldn't have offspring. Also the Pie was a sorrel with a white blaze and 4 white legs. and in the second hes a dark brown to almost black. Also National Velvet took place in the 1920s and Im assuming International Velvet took place in the 70s. so that would make velvet almost 60 or so. But overall the  movie is good but wished they would of gotten the facts right before they made the movie,1168646400,3,666,4.244094488188976

Anything involving horses gets my attention, and I must say I was not ready for the story to end.  A bitter and uncooperative Sarah came to England to live with her Aunt and her writer boyfriend.  I would have given it 5 stars if they had not been living together unmarried, which is not a good example in a family film.  But through their loving and sacrificial care, Sarah evolved into a lovely young lady worthy of admiration and honor.  Her tough equestrian coach even earned my respect by the end of the film.

Tatum O'Neal, Nanette Newman, Christopher Plummer, and Anthony Hopkins played their roles magnificently.  The beautiful horses and scenery only added to the enjoyment along with the believable and inspiring story. I felt a slight disappointment at the end when the small box did not contain an engagement ring, but that feeling was quickly overcome by what the box did contain.

I do hope others will feel this film worthy of release on DVD.  I will be watching for it Amazon!!  Thank you!",1160352000,4,1283,4.530434782608696
390346,5,6301969464,"There are so many reasons to watch and re-watch INTERNATIONAL VELVET.  The calibre of the acting is high, even from young Tatum, who does not exhibit the ""cute"" type of performance anyone who saw NATIONAL VELVET might expect.  I was surprised again and again at the sophistication of her acting.  British subtlety abounds.  Plummer and Hopkins are, of course, off the charts as always.  I loved the plot, aside from the quick marriage of Sarah towards the end, but that may be because I'd paired her off with Hopkins. The tension was on a par to watching the Olympics from the sidelines, very intense and absorbing. The scenery and the photography are beautiful enough in their own to make watching the movie worthwhile, especially the views of the ocean and the small Englsh village.  I may just have to buy this movie. Whether you love horses or England or sport or just a good yarn, this film fllls the bill.",1160265600,4,911,4.6625
390347,5,6301969464,"Like its predecessor, National Velvet, International Velvet (1978) boasts a stellar cast: teenager Tatum O' Neal, the gorgeous Nanette Newman, and leading men Christopher Plummer and Sir Anthony Hopkins.  It also has a more believable plot and a top-notch writer/director in Bryan Forbes (The Stepford Wives, The Slipper and the Rose, The Guns of Navarone, Colditz). The main stories are Sarah Brown's (O'Neal), an American orphan who finds herself in England with an aunt she doesn't know (Newman as the adult Velvet Brown), and of the horses and people inextricably entwined in their lives.  A poignant and graceful growing up story of the challenges facing a difficult teenager and the adults who raise her, International Velvet has something for both horse lovers and non horse-lovers alike. More important than Sarah's bid for the Olympics is the love that is won. The cinematography and soundtrack are stunning and each should have been nominated for an Oscar; Tatum should have won another with this role, too.  Beautiful scenery.  An under-rated feel-good family film!

Warning:  Box of tissues useful when watching this movie as, amid the love and triumph, there is some gritty realism.",1141948800,7,1195,5.230366492146596
390388,4,6301969464,"In this far-flung sequel to 1944's National Velvet, impetuous teen Sarah Brown (Tatum O'Neal) follows her dream to become an Olympic competitor. Under the tutelage of a tough-as-nails trainer (Anthony Hopkins) and a headstrong horse called The Pi, Sarah grows into a strong, sensible young woman. The timeline and the tone of the sequel hardly qualify International Velvet as such, but the show-jumping action, horsy dramatics and rider dynamics are strong.  Credit is given to the novel National Velvet by Enid Bagnold.

It is easy to enjoy, and I still find myself on the edge of my seat after a huge number of viewings and many years. I was a horse lover when I first saw it, but my husband has ridden twice and loves this film also.

It has a bit of everything: humour, drama and suspense, while also dealing with issues of growing up.

390391,3,6301969464,"This movie had a lot going for it--Anthony Hopkins, a beautiful score and scenery, wonderful cross-country eventing scenes--but on other terms it falls quite flat. At some points Tatum O'Neal is acting very well; at other times she's not quite up to the material. Christopher Plummer and Nanette Newman are charming as John and Velvet--I particularly like John--but many of the other characters are just two-dimensional, like the student with the crush on Sarah, her riding partners, etc. Plus the romance late in the film just appears; she marries this guy after knowing him two weeks???? The quality of the film is uneven as well; sometimes it looks as if it were videotaped rather than filmed. Plus there's a big anachronism in the film: NATIONAL VELVET takes place in the 1920s! In the 1970s Velvet would have been an elderly woman and the Pi would have been dead!

[Update 2008!] Just a note on a DVD version of this film: it does exist! Find a DVD collection called ""Classic Horse Favorites: 4 Film Favorites."" I bought this DVD specifically to get a copy of INTERNATIONAL VELVET that was better than my recorded-off-TV-with-commercials-cut-out version. The box said INTERNATIONAL VELVET was fullscreen, which kind of disappointed me. Although there are parts of the film I am lukewarm about, I love the cinematography and the great Devon landscapes, the three-day eventing filming, etc., and these are all shown up better in widescreen. What a delightful surprise to put on INTERNATIONAL VELVET and find out the film is ACTUALLY PRESENTED IN WIDESCREEN! This collection also includes NATIONAL VELVET, which I love, and BLACK BEAUTY, also a great film, although sadly the latter is only full screen (I have the widescreen version). The fourth movie, THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT, is a totally fictionalized version of the great racehorse's career. However, it is a typical 1940s racetrack flick, features Shirley Temple in an adult role, and also co-stars great character actor Barry Fitzgerald.",1069459200,7,1996,5.103975535168196

390394,5,6301969464,"I've never understood why this movie has been so largely ignored by viewers and critics since its release in 1978.
I saw ""National Velvet"" when I was young, and truthfully, I hated it.  I was able to get my mother to take me to see ""International Velvet"" because of her love of Elizabeth Taylor (her peer) and the original. I loved this movie for many reasons, but it was wonderful to see Tatum O'Neal (a slightly-older peer of mine) in such a wonderful, heart-warming role.
Ms. O'Neal moved so gracefully in this movie from age 8 to 18 without question.  She portrays Sarah Velvet Brown, niece of the ""original"" Velvet Brown - winner of the Grand National. At the beginning of the film, Sarah arrives in England to live with her Aunt Velvet and ""Uncle"" John after the car-accident deaths of her parents in their home town of Cave Creek, Arizona.
She soon develops a keen interest in horses, and raises Velvet's horse, ""Pi""'s son, ""Arizona Pi"" to adulthood and eventually rides him to to the Olympics.
This is a true ""coming-of-age"" story with SUPERB cinematography (a stunningly-beautiful sea-side English locale), haunting score and stellar acting by a first-class cast, including two of my all-time favorite actors, Christopher Plummer and Sir Anthony Hopkins.
A year or so ago, I happened to catch the tail-end of a short featurette on this film, on the Independent Film Channel.  It featured clips and details about how Tatum O'Neal learned to ride entirely for, and during the production of this movie.  The race-footage clearly shows Tatum doing most, if not all, of the actual riding, even in the most difficult steeplechase sequences.
Even if you're not a horse-lover, you'll adore this movie.

In Enid Bagnold's novel, The Pie is clearly stated as being a gelding. It is a biological impossibility to have offspring from a gelding! And, obviously, you DO NOT retire a gelding to stud! There is very little connection to the original film. Very thin plot delivered by very thin acting. Actually, I wish Brtish filmmakers would do a remake of the original movie, based faithfully and solidly on Bagnold's novel. For example, the name ""The Pie"" in the novel is short for ""The Piebald"" because the Pie was a black-and-white piebald colored horse (what America would call a ""pinto""). Secondly, as I mentioned, The Pie in the novel was a gelding. Thirdly, there were four daughters, including Velvet, in the novel. Fourthly, Mi was not an ex-jockey; in fact, he didn't even ride horses; he was a long-time assistant to Mr. Brown, a butcher. Fifthly, Pie did not get sick. Sixthly, in the novel there was much more family dynamics, and Velvet was a much stronger, more mature and complex character.
