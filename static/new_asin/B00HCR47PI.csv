8631541,5,B00HCR47PI,"This film shines a light on the mostly forgotten story of the Reno family of Southern Indiana and their criminal exploits. Several of the Reno brothers stood at the center of an outlaw gang that was reported to at one time number nearly one hundred. Stories of robberies, murders, and other illegal activities terrorized the citizens of Indiana and the surrounding region throughout the mid-1800s.
The Legend of the Reno Brothers features expert interviews and impressive historical reenactments in between period photos, periodicals, and music.
I was especially impressed with the actors chosen to portray the Reno brothers. Their resemblance to the originals made the transitions from actual photographs to dramatization seamless. When you consider the historical significance of this story it is incredible that it has not garnered more attention until now.
I learned a lot from this film and would recommend it.",1390435200,4,915,5.361111111111111
