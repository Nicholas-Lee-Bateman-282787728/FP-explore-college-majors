If you love the Wutang's movie collects you'll love this but even big martial art fan will see this as just okay.",1362355200,,180,4.323529411764706
8092443,5,B000BT96X2,"i had this on vhs when i was kid. its also known as method man. o.k, i don't understand people, why do u guys bother to comment on the story line? who cares, its a kung fu flick, 90% of the time the plot is revenge. that gives us reason for all the fighting. now the fighting and acrobatics in this flick is top notch. if u see a kung fu movie with a wu tang rappers name, its probably pretty damn good. why else would they name themselves after a kung fu movie. i cant believe its only a quarter!!! i love being a kung fu collector during these times, its just so damn affordable!!! cant wait for it to come in...",1228176000,,614,4.0

8092445,3,B000BT96X2,"Cassanova Wong (""Warriors Two"") stars as the bad guy in a plot that you've essentially seen in a 100 (or more) kung fu films.  Yet, this is still totally worth checking out.  The occasional point of view from the villain is also kinda different and appreciated.

Peter Chang is given an amulet by his father prior to the old man's death at the hands of an assassin (Wong).  Chang witnesses the death, but knows no kung fu, and the only revenge he would be able to obtain, would be on Wong's knuckles.  He flees and joins a group of traveling acrobats, learning what he can as he goes.  Though Wong doesn't know who the boy is, he keeps running into him as he tracks the amulet.  Eventually a thief named Stumpy steals the item, leading to some confusion about the identity of the person Wong is looking for, which inadvertently buys Chang more time to train.

Peter Chang is quite an acrobat and it's surprising that he hasn't been in more movies.  This film starts with a decent fight, then wallows for a while in ""plot"" development and unfunny shenanigans.  Then the end has about 4 good, lengthy fights in a row as Cassanova Wong kicks his way to the people he is seeking.  The finale takes place in a barn, filled with ropes, barrels, and hay, and is one of the best fights I have seen in a long time.  Very creative and well executed.

Distributed by Black Lotus films, the partially widescreen picture quality is pretty good.  English dubbed only, and some of the voices are bad and don't fit well.  Minor complaint though.  This movie was the subject of much lament for me as I repeatedly passed on its purchase when it was available last summer at a local chain for $4.99.  Had I even the slightest idea it was this good, I'd have bought several to pass on to friends.  It was 5 bucks, starred Cassanova Wong, and it was kung-flippin'-fu!  Well, live and learn, I reckon.  3.5/5
