6547206,1,B00M25EALG,"Since the preview reveals nearly the entire plot I will be brief: Lucy is in Taiwan and is forced to be a drug mule, the bag of drugs leaks into her body invoking cellular changes, as a result she utilizes more and more of her brain and again as a result acquires special powers, gets revenge, and finally moves on from this mortal coil to a presumably richer existence that requires neither air conditioning nor a direct Internet connection.  That is it, folks. The lowest rating I can give Lucy is a single star, thus it appears that I was 20% entertained.  But this minimal rating overstates my true level of entertainment by more than 100%.  Anyone using around 10% of their brain will recognize plot holes, inanities galore, considerable bad acting, a cartoonish gang of Asian bad guys, and an wide array of unimpressive special effects.

Many scenes felt as though they were contrived merely so show Scarlett Johansson ""kicking bad guy butt"", but since in most of these scenes she uses her new found powers rather than hand-to-hand combat - as her character does in the Iron Man and Avengers movies - they were rather tepid and boring.

The special effects were cheap and unimaginative.  The worst effects were held back for the end where Lucy merged with an array of computers as a creeping mass of sticky black tar, albeit highly intelligent tar.  (I suspect the producer hired the same CGI bozos that gave us the idiotic black tar special effects in Spider-Man 3.)

Scarlett Johansson did a credible job given the material, particularly in the first fifteen minutes when she was terrorized into being a drug mule.  But once her powers appear her one and only acting face was that of steely resolve.  My guess it was the steely resolve needed the get through this debacle of a movie with as much grace as possible and move on to something else.

The flashbacks to prehistoric times and the Morgan Freeman character and dialogue were added in vain attempt to make the movie profound and thought provoking, in the fashion of the movie 2001.  The only thought provoked was that I probably should walk out now and do something else - anything else.  But I endured to the bitter - the last Asian bad guy is dead - end.  Lucy now has access to 100% of her brain and logically decides to leave the movie.  She is corporeally with us no more, but has merged with the computers and the environment, and presumably is watching over us all.  Perhaps she will merge with a computer operating system.  Makes me wonder ... had this movie been released in 2012, ahead of the movie HER, both movies would then make some sense ... but no more that 10% total.",1406592000,24,2649,4.602127659574468
6547207,1,B00M25EALG,"Just avoid. Literally the worst movie ever made. I love Luc Besson, but something went seriously wrong here. In the beginning of the movie, Lucy's boyfriend is trying to persuade her into carrying something up to a Korean mafia boss. She refuses, but her boyfriend ends up making her go anyways. During the first 10 or 20 minutes, The director plays weird, random documentary clips symbolizing what is happening on screen. It's really bizarre. The film just gets worse from there. Whoever made the film must have been on drugs. Just a disclaimer here, I am a fan of Besson's past work, including Leon, Fifth Element, even The Messenger. This film was just out there. It was totally pretentious, but not even in a way that the snobs could call it a good movie. There are plot holes everywhere. I found it hard to believe Scarlett Johansson would take this project. It was a major mess.

By the end of the film, I wouldn't blame anyone for throwing objects at the screen. It was just that bad. Once upon a time, the news media would be honest and call movies like this out. What a shame. Seriously, it was that bad and it's not even subjective. Stay away!!!",1406592000,10,1155,4.552884615384615
6547208,4,B00M25EALG,"***VERY MINOR SPOILERS***

As I'm not really a fan of Luc Besson, I went into his latest film with no expectations whatsoever. I can't quite say I was taken aback or blown away by the plot, and there were a few hundred things I'd have done differently had I been in the director's chair. To keep things simple, let's just say that what you're led to believe about ""Lucy"" from the trailers is not the movie you get.

Scarlett Johansson, who plays the eponymous protagonist, is thrust early-on into the role of an unwitting drug mule for a Taiwanese cartel. By the film's end, she's traveling back in time to deliver her divine spark to a simian precursor -- thus kick-starting evolution as we know it. Scarlett's Lucy begins this oddly cyclical race as an ingenue, makes a pit stop at ""a**-kicker,"" and finishes in a state of complete omniscience.

Sound ridiculous? Honestly, when you watch it, ""Lucy"" is no more or less out there than ""Under the Skin,"" where Ms. Johansson plays an alien seductress discovering what it means to be human. If that film is a meandering homage to Stanley Kubrick's directoral styling by way of David Lynch's mind-boggling weirdness, ""Lucy"" is its hyperactive fraternal twin, rolling on MDMA and flashing erratically through ninety minutes of accelerated transhumanist science fantasy.

And when I say ""science,"" PLEASE take that aspect with a grain of salt. The whole ""10% of the brain"" thing peppered throughout the trailers is utter nonsense; a mere vehicle to drive the plot to its inevitable terminus. This film is all about style, and that's where it succeeds in a big way. Besson gets quite a few points for blending just the right amount of action with Lucy's rapid-fire monologues (she grows too prescient to carry on meaningful conversations) as the drug in her system alters the very fiber of her being. Scarlett Johansson is positively electric as Lucy, and is the glue that holds this movie together.

Her performance is both a blessing and a curse, because every abrupt cut the director makes to Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) spouting theories on the untapped human mind is terribly distracting. While watching these scenes, I found myself on the edge of my seat in anticipation of the inevitable return to Lucy and her uncanny ""development."" I don't think the film would have suffered at all had Freeman's character been introduced in medias res, as the primary focus should have been on Lucy. In my opinion, if you have a film where Morgan Freeman gets upstaged and relegated to a minor impact character, something is just ""off."" Or maybe it isn't...you'll have to see for yourself.

Honestly, you're not going to witness anything here that you haven't seen in a hundred other science fiction movies -- from ""2001"" to ""Inception"" to ""Akira."" But again, style wins over substance, and the sleek packaging of all these ideas actually make ""Lucy"" work in and of itself. The film, however, would fall to pieces without Scarlett's fascinating protagonist.

One more caveat. Luc Besson, you're not Terrence Malick. You can't pull off random nature shots and piece them together into something profound while interrupting the flow of your story. The ""animal parallel"" footage came off as facile and transparent. If Universal is wise, they'll force an alternate cut for the Blu-Ray release without this material.

Do I recommend ""Lucy?""

Yes. Check your own brain at the door but keep in mind that this film is science fantasy light on the science. ""Lucy"" will divide audiences. This isn't a love-it-or-hate-it movie, but even in its ambiguity, it's already polarizing moviegoers.

Is this the best sci-fi film I've seen this year?

No. ""Snowpiercer"" retains that title for the time being, and I don't see that eclectic masterpiece getting knocked down anytime soon.

""Lucy"" is what it is. A slick, polished vehicle to keep Scarlett Johansson firmly ensconced at the top of Hollywood's A-list. As far as I'm concerned, she's earned her place there.",1406592000,9,3990,4.947683109118087
6547209,2,B00M25EALG,i never walked out of movie this is a first.the first 25minutes were so slow it was boring.this is my opinion.wait for the dvd .,1406505600,,128,4.16
6547210,5,B00M25EALG,"Luc Besson has made a wide variety of great and terrible movies. I was one of the few who liked his last film, The Family (Robert De Niro mob comedy from last fall) for what it was. His new Lucy is the kind of movie we don't see nearly enough of. Suspenseful, funny, stupid and sort of brilliant in all the right ways, Lucy can satisfy intellectuals as well as the lowest-common-denominator audience, if the viewer knows how to dissect it.

Scarlett Johansson is Lucy, an everygirl who sort of becomes a god.

After Lucy, a college student living in Taiwan is forced by her boyfriend of one week to deliver a mysterious package to somebody, somewhere, she is lured into a horrifying criminal underground. She wakes up with a bag of a weird blue powdery drug implanted into her stomach. After being kicked around, the bag begins to leak into her body. It turns out this drug allows a person to use more of their cerebral capacity than anyone ever has, or can. She enlists the assistance of a professor (Morgan Freemanwho else?) to figure out exactly what is happening to her, and what will happen if and when she reaches 100%.

The films main concept, culturally accepted as fact, is mainly a hypothesis. We don't know exactly how much of our cerebral capacity is used. But as Lucy becomes more powerful, she is consistently aware of how much of her capacity is being used. One might think Lucy would want to go back to her simple life before all of this happened to her. One might also think her main mission would be to get revenge on those who wronged her, but one would be wrong. Once she accepts her situation, she finds a far more powerful calling. She could stand to be a tremendously important figure in history.

The science of Lucy is probably way off, but youd enjoy this movie more if you aren't looking for facts to nitpick. Nobody said it was a documentary. It raises some very fascinating points about life, knowledge, humanity and how it can be lost, but at its heart, Lucy is an edge-of-your-seat action movie.

Scarlett Johansson is a big reason why Lucy flies off the screen. Even though the audience doesnt always know, Johansson knows exactly who Lucy is, even as she deals all that is thrown her way. Allegedly, Angelina Jolie was originally going to play Lucy. Im glad she didnt. Johansson shines from beginning to end.

""Lucy"" is a very fast, very suspenseful and very short movie. It only runs about 85 minutes, but it doesnt waste a second. It takes longer to figure out an opinion of the movie than it does to watch it. One could call it messy, and it could have used another 20 minutes or so to better illustrate a back story of Lucys character, but you won't find a more satisfying and thrilling movie at the cineplex right now,

Grade: A-",1406332800,10,2767,4.522
6547211,1,B00M25EALG,This movie is 99.99% s***,1406332800,9,25,4.2
6547212,4,B00M25EALG,"Theatrical version.  There may be spoilers.

ScarJo in an action flick.  How could I resist.  Oh sure, she's been Black Widow in black leather in ""The Avengers"" but so far, a secondary character.  Here, Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a sometime college party girl living in Taiwan.  She's duped into taking a briefcase to a man in a downtown skyscraper.  She's quickly grabbed by some large Chinese goons and taken to the main man, Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi).  She doesn't know what's in the case but is ordered at gunpoint to open it.  The bad guys, expecting a possible bomb, hide behind walls and shields.  It doesn't explode.

It contains 4 packs of a blue powder substance.  I'll call it WD-40 because I can't remember what its name is but it is a high powered growth substance found in fetuses.  Mr. Jang and his evil-doers have found a way to create a synthetic form which provides a new high for druggies.  He plans to introduce it to Europe and America using 4 mules to carry the baggies sewn into their stomachs, specifically the intestine.

About this time I'm thinking this is a movie that might have starred Milla Jovovich.  But watching Ms. Johansson in this early scene suggested otherwise.  She's very convincing simulating the terror one must feel in a situation like this.  An American girl in a foreign country, grabbed in a public area, whisked before a terrorist drug thug in the midst of other casualties in nearby rooms.  It is an unsettling scene and some great acting.

Lucy and the other 3 are given passports and plane tickets.  While waiting for her flight, Lucy is kept in a dingy room with two guards who are looking for a bit of sex before putting her on the plane.  When Lucy resists, one of the guards beats her senseless which causes the WD-40 to leak.  This in turn causes a wiring malfunction inside Lucy's body.  Rather than kill her, it gives her a hypo-jolt of stimulus and increased brain function.

After disposing of a room full of guards, she returns to her apartment and makes a call to her mother.  This is mostly a one-sided conversation where Lucy tells her mother that she loves her.  She remembers her mother's kisses and affection over the years, even going back to her infant days of nursing.  She does this in great detail in a full screen close-up of Johansson's face.  Another acting lesson.

A backdrop to this story is that Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), a noted neuroscientist has been studying the use of the brain and how humans don't tap into much more than 10% with 20% a theoretical max.  Now frankly, as you might have guessed by now, I'm no neurologist or scientist of any kind, but I'm buying all of this because Morgan Freeman is saying it.  I'm going with it.  And if you want to enjoy the movie, so should you.  A brief aside please.  Lucy is not only our heroine's name but the name given a skeleton found years ago who is believed to be the earliest example of a bridge between ape and human.  We see several flashes of this humanoid during the film.

Speaking of flashes.  Whenever Lucy gets a new jolt of brainpower the screen fills with some eye-popping visuals.  I saw the film straight and on a huge screen with the newish Dolby Atmos sound, it was pretty thrilling.  We see Johansson take her character slowly from a frightened young woman to an almost robotic machine with each gush of WD-40 entering her system.  I will caution viewers expecting non-stop action sequences of Lucy kicking butt.  They may be disappointed.  She does plenty, but with each jolt of brainpower she's more into neutralizing her foes rather than killing them.  But there is an inventive race against time throughout the Paris streets with the enhanced Lucy at the car's controls.

Director and writer Luc Besson gets back in the game with this entertaining film even with its slightly ridiculous premise.",1406332800,180,3859,4.660237388724036
6547213,2,B00M25EALG,"Beyond its several neat visual flourishes, Lucy is a largely idiotic and rather unsatisfying science-fiction action film.  It is the story of an American student abroad in Taiwan (Scarlett Johansson) who, against her will and in over her head, is forced to become an instrument of a criminal underworld.  A container of a just-synthesized narcotic is placed into her abdomen.  When it ruptures after a beating by an overzealous henchman, the drug lets her utilize more and more of her cerebral capacity.  With the resulting superpowers, she avenges the wrong done to her and begins to absorb and interpret the knowledge of the world.  Lucy entirely fails as an action and chase picture:  when a character can send people flying into the next room or pause time with a tiny facial gesture (and she is the only one with such an ability since this is not X-Men), it is hard to convince the audience she is ever truly endangered.  As a result, the various car chases and gunfights have a halfhearted and routine quality.

What is left is the more psychedelic story of a woman's mind expanding until it is the size of and one with the universe.  Alas, Lucy's exploding I.Q. and electrified conscious is mostly conveyed in boring and simplistic ways, including shots of her rapidly typing and reading through the Internet.  Quote-unquote knowledge is referenced, but its dimensions and implications are never directly dealt with, and there is a grievous dearth of genuine, mind-bending, Matrix-style moments of revelation.  There are other bumps in the proverbial road, including a first act which again and again disrupts the momentum of Lucy's worsening plight to let Morgan Freeman, typecast as a benevolent academic and father figure, explain (and explain, and explain) the Internet-popular myth humans only use ten percent of their brain's capacity, which is, of course, B.S.  These scenes are tortuous despite Freeman's iconic, sonorous voice.  Cosmic abstraction in the stylistic vein of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Tree of Life is laced throughout, but these moments, while at times beautiful, play as pretentious, see-what-I-can-do distractions rather than organic components of what is ultimately just a daft genre exercise.",1406332800,7,2230,5.14404432132964

6547215,3,B00M25EALG,"The science behind Luc Besson ' s latest science-fiction/ action film ""Lucy"" is devastatingly flawed, the dialogue occasionally embarrassing and wooden (as are often the performances though I believe this is at least intentional on Scarlett Johansson ' s behalf) but all that is easily forgiven in a movie that packs so many ideas, creativity and imagination into an 89 minute run time as is shown here.
 Initially Besson's artistic touches ( which seem greatly ripped off of Kubrick ' s ""2001:A Space Odyssey"") are off-putting but slowly, as the run - time progresses, it takes off and only adds to its incredibly unique midnight movie charm.
  To add to the mixed bag this film is as an action film it's not entirely satisfying , as science-fiction it works well but, as an experience it is very much it's own wonderfully flawed entity.
  The C.G.I., much like the pretentious and falsely high minded screenplay, is hit and miss (a re-occurring scene with an ape,also named Lucy, is especially bad after the seamless effects of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" from 2 weeks ago)but, it's not every day a movie that hits such creative zeniths as this arrives in mainstream theaters.
 With Besson ' s distinct gritty style and a pace that moves like a rocket (stopping only in a few scenes fpr quick bouts of forced character development) the enjoyment factor only increases.
For now I will say a solid *** out of ***** but I have a stinging suspicion that rating will increase with time and reflection.",1406246400,3,1503,4.7615384615384615

1. Scarlett Johansonn's performance carries the film. I know, she is the title character, but even then.

2. The fact that this movie will change your belief systems about what is possible in life. A didactic reason I know, but it affected
  the rating upward.

I liked the film because of the premise. In terms of editing and special effects, it is not top of the line. I did not like the overall
aesthetic 'feel' of the film.

I wonder about the mystical effects this film will produce. Every work of art is on a certain plane. There will be a critical mass
on earth one day (due to works like this). Then we will experience free energy amongst other things.",1525824000,,707,4.4

6547291,2,B00M25EALG,"I will say this: the movie is weird.

Lucy (played by the ever enjoyably fun to watch Scarlett Johansson) seems to be getting the worst deal of her life. Conned by her loser boyfriend to work as a drug mule for the Hong Kong mafia, they surgically place a bag of an experimental recreational drug that contains human growth factor extracts into her abdomen and when a thug kicks her when she doesn't seem all too pleased with his romantic advances, the crook accidentally breaks the plastic bag depositing a large amount of the strange material into her blood stream.

For some inexplicable reason, whereas small amounts of the drug cause junkies to go crazy, it grants Lucy higher psychic perception while at the same time starts to consume her mortal body. As she becomes slowly posessed by some strange greater universal knowledge, she initially tracks down the other 4 drug mules to absorb more of the strange blue material and finally asks for the help of a prominent scientist played by Morgan Freeman to devise a way to try to rid her of the blue stuff in her body before it ultimately kills her.

I think the movie had a lot of potential. The special effects are really good but it just seemed like a case of a lot of flavor and not enough substance.

The movie shows how the drug is slowly controlling her body and mind but we don't see any change in Lucy's demeanor. If I had known that I was being used as a drug mule, injected with a bag with weird blue jello and then have my life pending on a thin line knowing that in 3 days my body is going to be ripped apart, I think that I'd totally freak out. Save for a brief phone call to her mom early in the film, Lucy quickly loses all traces of her human personality and her new enlightened persona seems sort of all over the place.

I would have wanted her to have more doubts early into the movie, perhaps get her involved with the interpol cop earlier while she still retains some of her inherent humanity and fear. Instead, she contacts him when she's already around 60% posessed and seems to only use him as a free meal ticket. To me, the interpol cop was the most emotionally interesting character of the movie but he's just some token hot guy that doesn't know what is going on.

The mafioso dudes showing up 2 hours later in Europe looking riled that she stole their stuff seems to divert the plot away from the initial urgency of her trying to find a cure before her body blows up. It seems like they left that in the plot for action scene fan service. I found that unecessary given you can already enjoy Scarlett kicking butt in the Avengers movie universe.

The action fluff scenes seem really out of place with the pseudo intellectual discourses Morgan's character gives with random scenes of cheetahs killing prey that are shown during the entire film. I think that this movie could have become a cult classic if it had taken the plot to a different direction. Still, it has some good moments.",1523836800,,2965,4.449355432780847

So-called gratuitous violence rarely worries me too much, but in this case, it truly was gratuitous - no particular reason for it, and not seemingly 100% connected to the ""plot"", although I must use that word loosely.

The 4K looks stunning, and if anything made me appreciate the film even more. There are so many elements that benefit from 4K that I was surprised.

I bet 2 hours would have gone a long way to making a better movie. That said there is a lot of enjoyable action with a vibe reminiscent of Borne Identity and some awesome imagery reminding me of Revolver.

The movie is very short, only an hour and a half. Not enough is done with the concept and Morgan Freeman's character is tied very loosely to the plot. Also I'm tired of seeing him show up in movies and do his typical generic act, get someone else in there for crying out loud.

There are also some good set-pieces and the effects are quite impressive. The cast are uniformly good, especially Johansson, who appears to enjoy her role.

The first parts of the movie are fine, but then becomes some kind of comic book special effect extravaganza. Is it Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? If the Director really wanted to be ambitious in that area, he should have had her make love to the police captain. Frankly, car crashes and special-effects became BORING.",1497052800,,394,4.72463768115942
6547547,4,B00M25EALG,"The most stunning thing about this movie (aside from Scarlett Johansson) is the deep spiritual meaning that comes near the end. Yes, amid all the mayhem, the shoot em ups, the science impossible there is something very redeeming about this and it has to do with what it means to be alive and to be human.

What Lucy is able to do cannot possibly come about from taking substances into her system as in the movie. However the incredible power, knowledge and freedom she achieves is something that may be possible for humans some distant day--or rather possible for our intelligently designed descendants who will be cyborgs or something beyond that.

The story itself and the way French born director Luc Besson (Lon: The Professional, La Femme Nikita, etc.) moves the plot along with action that keeps us enthralled amounts to a first rate sci fi thriller. Johansson who plays Lucy and whose countenance dominates the film is wonderful. And I don't mean merely from the fact that her face is mesmerizing but also because she does such a great acting job in a demanding role.

I am giving this film only four stars because of the rather lame idea that we use only ten percent of our brains. That idea was disposed of decades ago. Of course as a metaphor it works okay. However it could be better said that we are currently achieving only ten percent of what we could achieve.

I also don't think Besson, who also wrote the script for the film, has the right notion about time. He has Lucy say, Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist.

However, time like other units of measure really just compares two or more things, in this case events. Many scientists believe that time per se does not exist and is an abstraction, or as I see it time is a mathematical point.

But much of the philosophy and/or psychology in the film is if nothing else interesting and worth thinking about. For example Lucy says, We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale. This is true in a practical sense but I believe it is also true in a philosophical and a spiritual sense.

I will be seeing this film again.

This is just a review of the movie since I doubt I'll buy the BD. I can only imagine Johansson rans liking this horrible science fiction flick because it's impossibly stupid. She looks good, whatever... her acting is kept to a minimum which seems to be some type of lowered standard for her gruff, Brooklyn hooker voice acting style. The story goes from her character, a trampy chick who's low life boyfriends handcuffs her to a briefcase full of a refined synthetic drug which you find out has the ability to cause 'transcendent' biological metamorphosis within those who take the drug. Her boyfriend is murdered in broad daylight and she's wicked away by a Korean crime syndicate who traffic drugs etc. She wakes up and the packet of the drug has been surgically inserted in her abdomen, she's later beat up and kicked in the stomach breaking open the packet of the drug which in turn starts to transform her into some omnipotent super woman/being who can transcend time and the fabric of space! lol... yes REALLY!!! So, some chick... some low life bimbo goes from a lowly tramp hooker type to God like super being by the end of the movie...yes, really. It actually reminds me of the famous anime manga and later film Akira but not nearly as convincing as the anime.

It's a ridiculous movie and hardly worth viewing more than once unless you just like Johansson and she turns you on 'visually' because there's no real acting going on other than forced touchy feely scenes that are laughable.",1494201600,,1649,4.666666666666667

Sexy Scarlett Johannson, transforming her intellectual potential into real powers of mind over matter as more and more of her brain matter is brought to full awareness and full utilization from exposure to a fetal developmental hormone.  It's a wild ride, as Lucy grows quickly into a kind of supernerd with super mental capabilities, but with a caveat that forces her to align her efforts with the most critical thinking minds of scientific investigation.  There's a lot, I mean a LOT, of gun-wielding violence as Lucy struggles to evade the attacks on her for purely business reasons at first, and then ultimately for personal as well as business motivations.

To buy, or not to buy, that is the question  Buy Buy Buy! If you have a 4k system do not hesitate to make this purchase. This is extraordinary reference quality material.

This isn't going to win any awards for excellence, but if you are a fan of Luc Besson thrillers you know what you are getting into. Regardless of the movie's merits and faults you MUST have this if you want to sell your friends and family on all that 4k and UHD can be. The clarity of the image is absolute precision. The colors are full and beautifully tinged with blues in many parts of the film, but this is not saturated as you often see when a movie shot in 2k is remastered in 4k in an attempt to convince the viewer they are viewing an upgrade over the original blu ray. Not the case here as this was shot digitally in 4k and takes advantage the advantages UHD offers. Darks are impressive and true while contrast details are not lost in it when not totally black.

6547726,1,B00M25EALG,"Pseudo-neuroscience coupled with flawed material-naturalism makes this one of the dumbest thrillers I've ever seen.  Scarlett Johansson turns in a stellar performance, but it's not enough to salvage the la-la premise of the movie.  Morgan Freeman appears to be going through the motions and it appears his heart wasn't really into this film.  His name adds star power, but it isn't within light-years of being among his best performances.

There is no real plot here.  It's just a sequence of loosely connected events seemingly bent more on promoting a particular philosophical view than telling a story.  There are long stretches of random special effects that add nothing at all except the revelation that the director apparently fell in love with what could be done in the digital laboratory -- whether it promoted a story or not.

When a movie fails, the primal level of failure is always the failure to entertain.  With no story to speak of, with extended sequences of random CGI, and with an underpinning based more on philosophical promotion rather than story-telling, this film fails at the most basic level.  It does not entertain.  It merely diverts.  Diversion isn't entertainment.  It's just diversion.  Don't waster your time on this one.",1484265600,3,1251,5.103448275862069

However, I also found that the movie itself was also very good and worth the purchase! I was very surprised as the trailers were not very interesting at all and made it seem like an actiony movie with super powers but that is not the case. It was actually a very good sci-fi flick if you ignore the fake science that it's premise is based on.

6547801,5,B00M25EALG,"Just finished my fourth viewing.  I fast forwarded through a few parts, yep, I did, but I watched the most of it, and despite my psychic distance from it now, I still was allured enough to not stray to side thoughts beyond those manifested by the film's triggering.  Wasn't bored.  Am still a sucker for Scarlett too; I freely admit.  YMMV.

This film's many conceits had to be swallowed whole and in rapid fire order, but I still was able to not choke on the force feeding.  Love films with persons who gain power -- be it intellectual, physical, spiritual.  It's still interesting to me to see what some writer comes up with for the personality transformations due to the sudden onset of powers.  Many a tale suchly told, and I probably have seen most of them.

I take this film personally.

5-11-17 5th viewing.  I jumped to the just-had-surgery jail-cell scene.  And bam, the film grabbed me again.  I may have to see a head doctor.  Heh.  Probably it's just Scarlett, eh?  Sue me.  Watched it with sub-titles....it was good.

6-6-17 OMG 6th viewing from start to finish.  Sue me.  Dang thing grabbed me again.

7-23-17  Lucky seventh time's the charm.  Really enjoyed this again, and I don't mean just my favorite scenes.  There's new items and aspects I yet tonight discovered in it.  It must be art, and/or a fanboy.  This stuff just tickles parts of my brain -- can't help wanting another helping.  I'm pretty sure this gets watched again near termishly.  Didn't fast forward.  Love the script.  Action dynamics are, okay, way over the top, but oh so much for which one hits the pause button.  Sincerely want a sequel.

I know this isn't the movie for everyone, but I am willing to bet you will at least like this movie. Sci-Fi geeks are the main focus (go GEEKS, hehehe) but this really does have something for everyone. Careful about letting a child watch this, because there are a lot of drug references in it.

6547824,1,B00M25EALG,"I'm willing to give this movie a single star only because even with a truly terrible script, Morgan Freeman is still, well, Morgan Freeman. His acting, his portrayals were the only things positive in this movie.

So they spent $40 million making a movie on a theory that was disproved ages ago. Can't get too upset about that because $40 million is what A-list celebrity movies spend just on catering. And that may have been part of the problem. I'm guessing that if they spent just a tad more getting good CGI techs, the special effects wouldn't have looked like something the set director for Fraggle Rock came up with. More time could have been spent getting Ms Johansson to be a bit (or a LOT) more believable and maybe if they had a bigger budget, someone with cajones might have been able to tell Mr Besson how truly godawful the script is.

There are no words I can use to explain to others how migraine-inducingly bad the plot, dialogue, acting and concept are. I can only explain it with an analogy.

I saw Patrick Swayze in Ghost when I was about 13 and I remember being hung up on the scene when Sam's murderer entered his apartment while Demi was changing, and Sam was running up those stairs, tripping on them, trying with all his might to punch this guy's lights out. Even at 13 and at a time when mainstream movies didn't have good special effects, I couldn't wrap my head around why Sam didn't fall through those floating stairs. The movie had spent so much time on Sam's lack of mass and therefore his inability to move things or stop himself from sliding through subway doors, I kept looking at those stairs, seeing him fall ON but not through them. Of course a little later on him walking on pavement and sitting on furniture didn't make sense either, but Whoopi was hilarious, Demi tugged at your heartstrings, the film was romantic, and sad, and funny wrapped into an awesome package. It was a movie released in 1990 dealing with the concept of ghosts. They made a credible effort if we didn't delve too closely into what Sam could and couldn't do at any given time.

For me, LUCY is 90 minutes of Ghost stairs. Not a single part of it makes any sense. And unfortunately, none of it was interesting or funny or heart tugging so for an hour and a half, it was just Ghost stairs. I imagine it's the same horror a viewer feels if they watch the 3rd Matrix movie without watching the other 2 and who had no idea what the trilogy was about.

LUCY is my idea of hell...or torture. I'd wouldn't give up secrets under waterboarding, but make me watch this nonstop and I'll tell anyone anything they want to know.",1477699200,,2625,4.460416666666666

But, if you can accept (as a springboard) the urban myth that we use only 10% of our brain capacity, the film's action, acting, and special effects are quite good and involving. Something akin to the ending of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", reaching 100% brain usage, Lucy ends up transcending  her bodily existence to become fused with the universe as a whole. A ""big concept"" idea here. I just wish that the director would have placed an end note on the film, stating that the film's premise is based upon an urban myth that simply is not true.

Still, the visuals were pretty, and Scarlett Johansson did a very good job of making it convincing. Besides, I like Luc Besson's work. So I got it on UHD. After all, there isn't a lot available right now, and I thought the visuals would look impressive.

The UHD does look good - the intricate graphics come across well, and the image is more enthralling.

Admittedly, the improved look doesn't fix the plot holes, but I can enjoy the movie more in this format.

Second, no matter what he plays and what he says, Morgan Freeman is believable.  He is like a grandfather who takes you onto his lap to tell a story.  You KNOW he's safe and telling the truth.

This movie offers very intriguing premise of a person's ability to potentially access 100% of the brain's capacity.  What if man could do this? What if a person has the ability to manipulate their cells or access everything though themselves?

I find this an astounding movie, one I never intended on watching but became glued to it upon presentation.

The blu-ray was top notch but the uptick in detail and vibrant colors provided by this 4K disc are on another level! This is a film I enjoyed purely for the visuals, the action and Scarlett Johansson. The plot is really silly if you try to analyze it on even the most basic level but if you're in the mood for a ""sci-Fi""-ish action movie that will truly show off the capabilities of your new 4K HDR TV and Ultra HD Blu-ray player then you should definitely pick this up. Also, I like the slipcovers Universal has decided to use. The front is ""plasticky"" and shiny and glued onto the cardboard sleeve for a more premium look. It is very similar in appearance to the gorgeous ""diamond luxe"" packaging that Gone With the Wind and Gravity came in (which I LOVED but some did not).",1471392000,2,844,4.382165605095541

6547945,4,B00M25EALG,"This movie was a real mind-blower. But I've come to expect that from Luc Besson, who brought using ""The Fifth Element"" and ""The Transporter.""

Summary: Scarlett Johansson plays a beautiful but dim girlfriend of a drug dealer. She gets talked into carrying a briefcase into a drug deal for a casual but ruthless drug lord, which gets her turning into a mule for an experimental drug. The bag of drugs is implanted in her stomach, but bursts, giving her a major overdose. But instead of killing her, the drug begins increasing her brain capacity. You know the old saying about only using ten percent of her brains? She gets to one hundred percent.

First, she gets smarter, able to escape from the drug dealers and try to find a way to cure herself of the overdose. Then she becomes physically more skilled, growing more deadly, and able to take out a roomful of men without even entering the room. Then she gains new powers over space and time. Then things really get weird.

Scarlett does an awesome job before and after portraying this super-being, emotionless yet highly skilled.

The only problem with the movie is actually a major one, which is the idea that humans only use ten percent of their brains is a myth. So the entire premise of the movie is flawed. Still, if you just imagine it being about a woman who's becoming a more advanced being, it's great.

There are some deep questions in this movie about human potential, where we're going as a species, and where we've been. The action sequences are also truly awesome. Great movie.",1470873600,6,1543,4.658088235294118

6548045,5,B00M25EALG,"Once you've accepted the fantastic premise, the movie moves logically to its inevitable dramatic conclusion, and Scarlett Johansson is brilliant as the very ordinary girl who ends up using 100% of her brainpower thanks to an illegal drug. As the most brilliant -- and remorseless -- person in the world, she can manipulate others, read minds, and pursue her goals without too much consideration for anyone in her way -- bad guys, cab drivers or patients on an operating table. But she's also doomed and coming apart as she does so (at one point sitting in an airplane, she fizzes like an alka seltzer). Her monologue while on the phone with her mother is one of the finest set pieces of acting in recent years, and her range as she goes from flirty and kittenish to furious to terrified is impressive; but the smarter she gets, the more she becomes an emotionless automaton -- a waste of a good actress. Unfortunately director/writer Besson goes too far, unnecessarily relying on computer graphics as Lucy shoots oily brown tendrils over everything and constructs weird aeries, and what verisilimitude the movie offers goes out the window. But, for those that crave it, there's a lot of Johansson loping down corridors and hallways in slow motion with guns in both hands, shooting everyone in her way, What more could anyone want?

the movie has a lot of action -- certainly if you like to see pretty girls shoot people, this is the movie for you. The fact that there's now a brisk Internet business in CPH4 -- the fantasy chemical that turns Lucy into the greatest genius of all time -- demonstrates how realistic the movie is (and how gullible so many are, spending money on a mystery substance that somebody mixed up in his bathroom sink). Incidentally, since Johansson was not Besson's first choice to play Lucy (Angelina Jolie was) it must be a coincidence that the rather tenuous connection between Lucy and the eponymous hominid seems confirmed by the fact that the prehistoric Lucy was unearthed in Ethiopia by paleontologist Donald Johannson (slightly different spelling).",1465948800,,2081,4.895184135977337

I was hoping the film would represent a return to form for a director whose best films (in my humble opinion) remain two of his earliest films, ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon: the Professional,"" (two action films rightfully distinguished for their sheer style, and surprising depth of characterization). No such luck here, however (as MovieBob pointed out) the movie slyly advances the idea that the pursuit (and dissemination) of scientific knowledge is, not only a good thing, but in and of itself, is an ennobling endeavor.

Other Luc Beson films over the years have also been phenomenal.

6548228,5,B00M25EALG,"Spoiler Alert: My zeal to support this fine movie may have given more information than some wished to see. My apologies.

I think this is a great thinking person's type of movie. The premise of unleashing all of the human brain's capacity and what it would lead to is a fascinating proposition.
Scarlett Johansson is a free spirit in the Far East who is conned into giving a briefcase full of illegal drugs to a Yakuza type mob and is abducted after her con man is murdered before her eyes. She awakens from surgery to find a bag of the drug implanted in her abdominal cavity. Three other men have had the same procedure performed on them and the four are supposed to carry the drugs to European countries for retrieval by the mob.
Johansson/Lucy is assaulted in a mob safe house and the bag of drugs in her splits open to release the drug into her system. She escapes in spectacular fashion.
In the meantime, Morgan Freeman plays a distinguished and respected researcher on the human brain and its potential for increased utilization. His discussions are interesting and seem very plausible although the ultimate achievements are not knowable.
Choi Min-Sik plays the leader of the mob, a ruthless and cold blooded killer who develops a fatal attraction to Lucy. The highlight of the movie in my opinion was her discussion face to face with him when she has made her escape and he was in a bit of discomfort.
Lucy is now on a mission to complete 100% of her brain capacity before she dies, and that leads to some fact action and a huge gunfight before she confirms all of Freeman's theories and suppositions as very real before she is transformed into energy.
This movie is an excellent mix of science fiction and compelling intellectual research. If you have an open mind, you sill enjoy this one.",1459123200,25,1798,4.636363636363637

6548286,5,B00M25EALG,"So I also live in Spain and mostly buy my movies on Blu-Ray. Have been looking at an option to purchase movies online in English without needing a VPN to pretend I am somewhere else. The Apple ecosystem seems like the best, but I hate the closed Apple Ecosystem. I am a Microsoft grunt, in the sense I have a Windows phone, Xbox, Windows 10 PC etc., but the Windows store also has this retarded only in Spanish system where movies are not available in their own original language. I just went to Google Play to check out the Google option and they too have a retarded system. I see what Paolo says about the content owners, but I do not give two hoots about the content owners. At the end of the day, it is Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other company which is licensing me the content. If they cannot be bothered to license me digital content with a plethora of language and subtitle options, well then I cannot be bothered to purchase the content. Either give me something which is a value proposition or shove it, and trust me there are plenty of other options for obtaining the content for free in the languages I want.

The companies involved, content producers and licensing re-sellers need to smarten up and improve their game or they will never attract customers like me. I have no problem paying for the content, but I will not buy or ""license"" a shoddy product which I cannot even view in its original language. NO NO NO. Wake up and smell the coffee that we live in a multi-language world where people are travelling and interacting with different cultures and languages more so than at any other time. E.g. I am British, living in Spain with a Brazilian girl friend. I want to watch stuff in English , she wants to watch stuff in Portuguese or at least with Portuguese or Spanish subtitles. The online options available from the three major companies are all pretty poor. Stop locking down language options, and make it easier for the customers to get the content they want and are willing to pay for. These language restrictions are dreamt up by retards at the content producers who have a scant understanding of the markets they are selling too.

Aside from that, the content producers currently have an oligopoly in place with the artificial licensing restrictions by country which stop us from playing our content whilst travelling etc., Again, this is a Kafkaesque system drawn up by idiots who have no understanding of what their customers actually want. The EU is slowly coming around to realising what these retards have put in place and there is talk of removing the license restrictions by country and creating a homogeneous EU zone. Bring it on. Then there will actually be proper competition in a more normal marketplace rather than the current artificial monstrosity which as users we currently suffer through.

Sadly, right now, Apple appears to have the ""best"" system in place for language optionality. Disappoint Google! Google and Android have the most open architecture and I would much rather have bought into the Google ecosystem for movies.

It has been said by scientist, but no proven value to this analysis, that we only use 10% of our brains.  In the movie, Lucy (played by Scarlett Johannson) she is given a drug, nootropic, that has been placed into her abdomen.  The drug is responsible for heightened memory and cognitive enhancement.  When the bag ruptures in her abdomen her brain capacity goes from 10 to 100% and then the adventure begins. I will not give away the plot but I do have a few questions for you:

1) Do you have any idea as to how much of your brain you are using?
2) Are you using the full capacity of your brain or are you remaining dormant?
3) If you had the capacity to utilize more of your brain's capacity, say 50%, what do you believe that you would be able to accomplish?

One hint:  Lucy was able to use telekinesis (psychic abilities) once she touched someone.

6548337,4,B00M25EALG,"I really liked this movie, way more than I first expected to.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had taken a little more time at the beginning and not just dumped us right into the action and if the movie had taken a little more time exploring the philosophical and scientific aspects of having your mind expanded like the main character.  The acting is good, the action is terrific, and the ideas are...well, mind blowing.  As they well should be.

Lucy is a young woman who is out looking for fun and meets up with a guy who gets her involved way over her head.  A hot new drug has been invented and they are looking for dupes to carry it to other countries and Lucy ends up as one of their number.  Problem is, she ends up getting beat up and the pouch of drugs inside her starts leaking and, rather than die, she ends up having the potential of her mind begin to expand.  She becomes pretty unstoppable as a result, ignoring more and more of the petty ideas of the world and of human nature as she goes after the ultimate potential of the human mind...what some would call enlightenment.  Of course, this movie doesn't really couch a lot of the ideas in religious terms, but more in scientific ones, but even those have to be left behind as Lucy expands beyond mere human understanding.

Faults in the movie include the scientists attempt to comprehend what Lucy is going through, especially the lecture by Morgan Freeman's character that is given near the beginning of the movie as it just left too much out.  Maybe, the makers of the movie thought people just wouldn't get anything deeper?  Scarlett Johansson did a great job of becoming less and less human as the movie went on, yet still remaining a character you could connect to and care about.

This movie mingles quantum science with mysticism with philosophy.  It explores the nature of consciousness, of time, of matter, and the limitless possibilities inherent within them...and within each of us.

6548359,3,B00M25EALG,"It'd be a 4 star movie if they just left out the BS about 100% of the brain.  OK, we all know it's not true, we use all our brain, we just don't use it all at the same time.

Let's get that out of the way.  What they should have done instead was just focus on this drug that made you into a super hero if you got a massive dose internally.  That's more like Spiderman, it's stupid but not as stupid as getting bit by a Spider turns you into a Superhero.

See, so that is the thing, it's complete fiction, but they try to justify it with a myth which is even worse.  The thing is, it's a well acted movie and it's fun if you like action movies.  So they would have done a lot better just not even talking about 100% in the first place IMO.

Part of what makes it so stupid is even if we used 100% of our brains every minute of every day, we still couldn't move objects, change people's thoughts, etc. The concept of 100% isn't very related to the superhero powers she gets by ingesting so much of the drug.

And why it makes Lucy into a psychopathic killer is kind of beyond me.  She kills people that she doesn't even know.  But anyway, three stars, better than I expected.",1454112000,,1173,4.034632034632034

6548438,1,B00M25EALG,"Lucy attempts to take ""Limitless"" (2011, Bradley Cooper) a step further by suggesting an organic substance. produced by pregnant women,  can unleash the brain's full potential. The film's idea of ""full potential"" includes but is not limited to: telekinesis, psychokinesis, control of time itself, anti-gravity, x-ray vision, MRI vision, creation/control of matter, ability to travel at the speed of light, etc. Ironically, Lucy makes Limitless seem limited in comparison.

Past the absurdity of impossible super-powers resulting from taking a drug, the plot itself is just terrible and makes no sense. A woman with super powers who can do pretty much anything, seemingly cannot create or obtain more of a drug other than hunting down the other ""slave smugglers"" with packages of it inside of them. Likewise, a rich Korean mafia boss spends god knows how much money on assault weapons, ammunition, rocket launchers, bodyguards/infantry, plane tickets and car rentals to get back 3 pounds worth of a substance meant to be sold to ""college kids in Europe"". Apparently, launching SWAT-style raids in public places and killing police officers in a westernized foreign country is a safe, lucrative part of the drug smuggling business. Why couldn't he just make more of it? No one will ever know.

The script was just as terrible. For example, ""Lucy"" calls her mother for the first time in a while while a surgeon extracts the package of drugs from her intestines. She starts telling her mom how she can remember being inside of her as a fetus and remembers ""the taste of the milk your body produced"". If that's not something your mother might think is bizarre, she tops it off with telling her she can ""feel everything"". The gravity, the earth's rotation, etc. A normal mother who is not suffering from advanced dementia might say something like ""Are you OK? Are you on drugs? Are you having a stroke? What the hell are you talking about?"" But no, in the movie, her response is ""Oh sweetie, I love you too!"". What the....?

Around every 20 minutes, they show a black screen with a percentage # that represents how much of her brain's potential has been unleashed. 10, 20, 30 and so on. It did remarkably well as a guide to how stupid the movie became over time until ultimately the film's climax at 100% stupid.",1452556800,10,2305,4.887468030690537

6548531,1,B00M25EALG,"Its a common sci fi theme  we only use a small fraction of our neurons at any time. And so, if we up the neuron efficiency, wed get really smarter. This is just plain wrong. First off, the logic is terrible. It infers that we know what our neurons are doing all the time and everywhere in our heads. And, for the most part, were pretty clueless on that score. So you're off to a bad start with bad science in this movie.

The idea is so annoying that I have to say a bit more about it. You can think of a lot of reasons why you couldn't or wouldnt use all your neurons at once. For one, look at your brain as a toolbox with a bunch of neurons making up a single tool. We kind of know that this is true. There are facial recognition regions whose function is to recognize somebodies face, and thats it. Suppose you're sitting at your computer trying to remember how to write down the Ricci tensor, for example. You don't need a tool to recognize Ricci to do that! So that tool isnt, and wouldnt be used. But sometime you may need it in the future. Like if you're looking for Ricci in a crowded restaurant But that couldn't happen anyway as hes dead and all.

Even more devastating to the neuronal efficiency hypothesis is the fact that the brain works through collective behaviors. Our cognitive processes emanate from a kind of hive mind. What we call thoughts are wavelike electric excitations that run over our cortical tissue. Memories are embedded in tangles of neurons that form mathematical attractors  basins of excitation that we represent using vectors in some N-dimensional space.

Physically, these attractors or waves span significant portions of neural tissue. While they are excited to elicit a thought or memory, these volumes of neurons are dedicated to forming the given thought or memory. So we couldn't multitask these little bugs without loosing cognitive function. Its just the way out brains are built.

That doesnt mean other brain architectures aren't possible. Thats just the way it is with us. Are these waves or attractors scalable  can they be made smaller to do more? Well, theyd still span chunks of brain tissue as they engage in collective behavior. And a lot of the scale is necessary to assure reliability. Power dissipation may also become a problem for meat minds.

Two things stick out for me. First, even though the basic premise is silly, if you develop the characters right and have a decent plot, an entertaining event can be achieved. The TV show Limitless is cute and funny. But this movie isn't either. Its bloody and overly violent.

Also, if you're interested in this sort of thing, theres a lot of speculative fiction that explores what would happen if we blow mental capacity through the roof. Recently, the movie Ex Machina did a great job in exploring Kurzweils singularity concept. An of course, Lems Solaris and His Masters Voice looked at trans-human intelligence in stunning depth and detail. These would be a much better time investment.",1448668800,7,2992,4.683809523809524

I just purchased this movie yesterday, and I've already watched it twice!!  Shout out to the
Bessons, Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the production team!!

I especially liked: (i) the glimpses of  reality from the perspective of posthuman Lucy whose
intellect was seemingly orders of magnitude above modern humans, and (ii) the way that posthuman
Lucy was seemingly unconstrained by modern human notions of time, space, and even reality
itself.

Spoiler Alert:

A sequel could begin at the point where this movie ended: Lucy meets Lucy.
The sequel's theme could build upon the idea that there are ""Hints of a language in junk DNA.""

6548686,2,B00M25EALG,"I genuinely wanted to like this film. SJ's approach to the character was VERY unique, easily the best part of the film.

Unfortunately, her performance alone couldn't carry the entire project.

My major issue with the film was its foundational premise. It relies on the ""human beings only use 10% of their brains"" trope, and there is MUCH exposition surrounding this. Woefully, this premise is simply either incorrect or lacking important clarification depending on how you look at it. Humans only use 10% of their brains *at any given instance*, true enough, but overall we use the majority of our gray matter. Using ""70% of your brain"" all at once is the neurologic description of having a massive seizure.

Even this cliched premise would be excusable if the film did what films are generally supposed to do. Tell a story. A compelling story overcomes all other obstacles, but sadly there is effectively nothing in the way of actual story telling occurring here. There are a series of events that happen in a sequence, but that's ALL it has in common with traditional narrative.

In summary, this is one of those films that really seems like it *could* have gone somewhere. It definitely starts on good footing, SJ really inhabits the character right from the opening sequences. But then, in that horrible way that recognized potential can be painfully squandered, it too quickly veers off into pointlessness and Deepak Chopra-esque ""deepities"" (lots of words that sound like they mean something when in actuality they don't). It's as though the  screenwriter and director had a brilliant moment of artistic epiphany  a collective ""We've got this GREAT idea for the opening to a film/story"", but try as they might they could never really get beyond the moment of creative genesis.",1444348800,11,1783,4.986531986531986

It's very disjointed and the execution is sloppy at best.  If you're a fan of logic, this movie will make your head hurt.  For instance, in one scene she is able to disarm all of her assailants by waving her hand at them, but later on she needs a cop to protect her while her attackers shoot up a building. I mean, come on, it took her less than a second to defeat anyone that crossed her path in the first 3/4 of the movie, but then all of a sudden in the last few minutes, she needs someone else to do it so she can concentrate?  Why not just quickly disarm them, have the cops take them into custody, and THEN do that thing where she turns herself into a glitter thumb drive?",1444089600,8,948,4.338983050847458

The really excellent thing about science fiction is that if an imagination can absorb a thing, the thing can take imagination places that it could not go otherwise.
Patience was rewarded when Redemption came after her kidnapping, once her transformation had begun - Lucy smacked herself into the wall, screaming at full speed on the end of a chain and I thought now were in for some fun. The film was fun after that and if left unchallenged the film stands on it's own devices and merit. I bought it on blue ray after renting it, and watched it and picked it apart and so on. The film was edited to be the best it could have been for the genre it represents. That and I really like Scarlett Johansson.
Happily the Director left out any embarrassing attempts that other films have tried at love, and exchanged it for a pragmatic need for connection with the french cop, and through their tiny encounter - humanity. Good work.",1442534400,,1084,4.452261306532663

I watch movies for their entertainment value, and not because I aspire to be a movie critic. That said, I totally enjoyed this movie. It kept my attention on the screen, and at no point would I have considered missing several minutes for a bathroom break. It's an action packed, futuristic, sci/fi film that delivered in every way it was intended. If you feel the need to break down every aspect of a film as you watch, I'm sure you could make note of things you found wrong. (I pity you if you fall in this category) If you want to watch an action packed ""what if"" movie with a bad ass sexy leading lady, I think you will enjoy it immensely.

BUT let me assure you that Scarlett Johansson OUTSHINES them all.  It was a pure pleasure to watch this movie over & over again [and I'm not just talking about Lucy jiggling around braless].  As usual Morgan Freeman delivers the perfect under-stated performance as Lucy's one-man cheer leader.  The only nit-picking is that the hominid ""Lucy"" wasn't the ""First Woman"".  ""Lucy"" lived a maybe 2.5 million years ago.  Archeologists tongue-in-cheek refer to the First Woman as ""Eve"" who belonged to the San people and was born about 170,000 years ago in Northern Kenya.  ""Adam"" was another San tribes person born 110,000 years LATER; Adam & Eve never had any sexual contact. [Note that ""black"" people aren't ""equal"" to white/brown/yellow/red people.  ""Black people"" ARE white/brown/yellow/red people!

6548833,3,B00M25EALG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

""Lucy"" is famed action sci-fi director Luc Besson's latest import from France. The film is mainly in English and stars Scarlett Johansson who plays a student in Taipei, Taiwan, forced by an ex- boyfriend to deliver a mysterious suitcase to a Korean mob boss, Mr. Jang. It turns out that the suitcase contains packets of a new experimental drug called CPH4 which can enhance physical and mental capabilities. Jang has his henchmen sew packets of the drug into her stomach and while in captivity, one of the captors kicks her in the stomach breaking the packet and releasing all of the drug into her system. Lucy suddenly gains superhuman abilities including extraordinary depth of perception.

Early on it's clear that Besson has trouble deciding whether ""Lucy"" is a good ""Terminator"" or a bad ""Terminator."" After escaping by killing her captors, there's a rather ugly scene whether Lucy rushes to the hospital to have the remaining bag of CPH4 removed from her stomach. She kills a man on the operating table and rationalizes her actions to the doctors by indicating that the man would have died anyway (she scans the x-rays and concludes he is a terminal case.) Soon, however, Besson gets back on track by having Lucy strictly kill bad boys and clearly go down the ""good Terminator"" route.

Realizing that she will disintegrate without getting her hands on some more CPH4, using her super brain, she locates the three other drug mules and phones in their locations to handsome Parisian cop, Pierre Del Rio. Meanwhile, she contacts kindly super-brilliant Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who has been lecturing on increased mental capacity for years. Lucy's ever increasing knowledge will go to waste if she doesn't get it to Professor Norman before she expires.

The rest of ""Lucy"" is a combination of a dopey Asian mobster flick with some rather nice sci-fi visuals mainly involving time travel and psychedelic-like perceptions. As Lucy keeps developing her ""full potential,"" she also must fend off the mobsters who are trying to kill her. With her extraordinary powers, the mobsters are of course no match for her and she dispenses with them in a series of clich&eacute;d scenes including a car chase, assisted by the handsome Parisian cop.

In perhaps the neatest scene, she goes back in time to earth's creation by flipping her hand as if she going through pages on an iPad. My favorite time travel moment is when she finds herself on a street in the late 19th century.

The ending is rather anti-climactic. Before Lucy becomes one with the universe, she hands over her knowledge to Professor Norman on a flash drive (of all things!). Del Rio asks where Lucy is and a message on his cell phone shows up, ""I am everywhere!"" So presumably now Professor Norman will be able to cure all diseases with all the knowledge he finds on the flash drive.

Besson's creation of a superhero relies on the accidental consumption of an untested black market drug. Why would someone try to sell such an extraordinary compound on the black market when they could (perhaps with some tinkering) use it themselves and gain super-intelligence like Lucy? I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief, but it still feels a little too ""easy"" for this CPH4 drug to induce such effects in a human being.

""Lucy"" manages to be entertaining as well as tawdry as the same time. It passes the entertainment test but one gets the feeling that Besson is mired in the unsatisfying adolescent world of sadistic one-note mobsters and the vigilante's thirst for revenge.",1441324800,2,3584,4.902640264026402

Lucy seems to be a step above, with great visuals and enough humor to make it clear that the ""science"" is hooey.  But fiction is fun and that's what separates the exciting but factually incorrect Gravity from the dull and depressing but accurate Interstellar.

Abuse of her powers made her scary but why would using more of her brain not result in increased compassion for others, seeing the interconnectedness of all things, and mellowing out?

Juxtaposing thoughtful scholars against greedy violent gangsters and showing one individual trying to find her way through the morass is an effective way to put across the science. The director gives us the theories in parts, giving us time to absorb new ideas while the bad guys shoot it out. The end message was also a way of comparing what we have done as humans, to what we can do. I didn't find it difficult to comprehend and found Lucy's final gift moving.

Johansson was a good choice, with her real world figure, every girl vulnerability and a voice that can speak over the story without jarring the viewer.

The violence -- which begins about 5 minutes into the film and never lets up -- is horrific and completely detracts from the science fiction (though the science fiction is laughably unbelievable).

Why Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman chose to act in this movie is beyond me.

6548904,3,B00M25EALG,"I saw this movie in the theater and while I was glad I saw the movie, I wasn't that happy with it.  I won't bother explaining the plot -- it's been adequately discussed in several excellent reviews already.  It's a fascinating premise and the movie had some great moments but overall, it was a mess.  The problem, as I see it, is that the director, Luc Besson, couldn't decide if he wanted to make an action picture, a science fiction picture, a thriller, a crime picture, or a philosophical drama, so he decided to just make all of them in one picture.  Had he made any one of those it would have probably been a very compelling movie; perhaps a couple of the elements could have been skillfully blended; but mixing all of them just didn't work for me -- I found the verisimilitude was continually being broken for me as the movie shifted gears from one facet to another, usually leaving me groaning.

(the following contains some minor spoilers but nothing which gives away much of anything which wasn't pretty much included in the trailers for the film)
Part of the problem wasn't just that the movie was being pulled in too many directions, but that some of the elements were handled much less well than others.  For instance, the crime/action aspects of the film got laughable, even absurd at times.  For instance, at several different points in the film, Scarlett Johansson's Lucy is confronted by an ever-increasing army of thugs and in each case uses her increasing telekinetic powers to render them harmless.  Each time, however, she used a completely different method of doing so even though the previous methods had proved more than adequate -- an apparent attempt at keeping the action-picture from becoming stale, but for a serious picture the absurdity was a bit too jarring.  At one point, a virtual war breaks out between police and gangsters and even though it had been demonstrated that Lucy's power at that point could have easily ended the conflict, at that point she chose to do nothing and just let the police fight it out.  This could have been explained by the movie trying to make the point that as Lucy's consciousness expanded so far beyond that of the rest of humanity, she was losing that part of humanity that cared what was happening to those engaged in the fighting, but other elements going on at the time seemed to belie that, at least enough to keep the scene from working for me.

It was the philosophical aspects of the movie which were most interesting to me but aside from the fact that it was a fairly short movie -- a typical length for an action picture but not a serious drama -- one of the main liabilities of trying to include so many elements in a single picture is that most of them were not allowed to develop adequately, and I felt there were many aspects of questions about the limits and capabilities of the mind; the nature of man and man's evolution; etc., were simply given short-shrift in order to (sketchily) develop the other facets of the film.

I thought Scarlett Johansson was terrific in the part and Morgan Freeman can do little wrong in my book.  Add the fact that Scarlett Johansson is a lovely vision on the big screen and if this had just been a piece of fluff it would have been an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.  Unfortunately, it tried to be more than that and should have been more than that, but it really didn't succeed all that well.

If I had just waited and watched it on cable, I would have still been disappointed, but it would have been worth my time.  At movie theater prices, the disappointment stings quite a bit more.  What really hurts, however, is not the waste of money but the waste of great potential -- this could have been a significant work in better hands.",1440374400,2,3762,4.55786350148368
6548905,5,B00M25EALG,"Who knew she could act so well? I was rather disappointed with ""Under The Skin"" but, in all honesty, it really wasn't much of a challenge.  Lucy, however, is a different game altogether.  She excels in a plot usually reserved for leading men.  She makes it an experience you will soon want again.  Damn, this girl is good!",1440288000,,322,4.5
6548906,4,B00M25EALG,"I guess if you're going to make a movie with a ridiculous premise and silly theme, you ought to make the best darn movie you can.  And that's exactly what director Luc Besson did with ""Lucy.""  Basically, he took a drug/transcendence movie from the 70s (perhaps an inverse of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Altered-States-1980/dp/B0012DQZLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Altered States (1980)</a>), pumped up the special effects and action, used good actors/acting and made a pretty darn good movie.  Heck, he's even got some nice visual metaphors and witticisms going in the thing.  So, I'm rating the movie at a Pretty Good, highly enjoyable 4 stars out of 5 (I'd actually like to rate it at 3-1/2 stars, but fractions aren't allowed).

Aside:  It's interesting to compare the ""use more of our brain"" theme here with how James Alan Gardner treats it in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ascending-League-of-Peoples-Book-5/dp/B00J90CHKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ascending (League of Peoples Book 5)</a>&nbsp;(that's the 5th book in his ""League of Peoples"" series which starts here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expendable-League-of-Peoples-Book-1/dp/B00J90F354/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expendable (League of Peoples Book 1)</a>) book.  In this movie, using all the interconnections in our brain makes a smarter, more intelligent, godlike being.

Not nearly my favorite Besson flick (that award goes to his classic ""Leon"") but well worth the watch. Freeman sleepwalks through his role (as if he just briefly stepped away from hosting ""Through the Wormhole"") and the entire plot is a raging mess (a billionaire Asian drug lord would surely have better means to smuggling his wares).

My boyfriend compared the premise to ""Lawnmower Man"" (which I haven't seen) but he did make the distinction that Lucy was more interested in sharing her knowledge (hoping to improve humanity in a way) than the premise of the other movie.  There is a lot of violence portrayed but overall, it was a smart movie.  The hardest part for me to believe was that her regular old laptop could keep up with her new abilities.  I'll suspend my reality for the possibility of a drug induced super brain, but there's no way a regular computer would be reacting that fast.  :-)",1438732800,,802,4.489655172413793

Naturally we know that at one time the 10% brain use theory sounded reasonable and have move on from there decades ago. But Morgan Freeman can make anything sound real.

6549076,4,B00M25EALG,"THE FILM: For a film predicated on an oft-repeated (and debunked) popular myth, LUCY is pretty entertaining, if a little ridiculous. Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a young woman is pulled into being a drug mule. However, interesting things start happening to her when the drug leaks into her system. Among the complaints one could lodge against LUCY, the biggest one is how thinly written the whole thing is. We are given precious little information about Lucy, and most of the other characters don't do much but further the plot along or provide exposition. Morgan Freeman is probably the most interesting of these, a scientist/professor whose field of research happens to coincide with what Lucy is experiencing. Still, the film seems to be aware of this and wastes no time in getting to the point. It follows a very fast pace, and it becomes almost a game to guess what powers Lucy will access as her cerebral capacity gets closer to 100%. There's also some real-life footage of animals and cool visual effects sequences of cells dividing and cosmic-level events which one will either take as profound or pretentious. I took it as somewhere in between, but leaning more towards the latter. I didn't really get the feeling that the film was going for a particular message, but the idea that wonder is part of what makes us human is an interesting one, as Lucy becomes less human the more knowledge and brain power she acquires. There also seemed to be the idea that knowledge makes us god-like. Altogether, it waxed fairly philosophical for an action film with a threadbare plot. Time will only tell whether or not I really love it, but for now I'm content in saying I liked LUCY a lot. Luc Besson's films have never been known for being particularly deep, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun here creating something that does make you think a little, even if it's based on an incorrect idea. For all it lacks in plot or story, LUCY has plenty of gumption when it comes to philosophical and visual ideas.

THE EXTRAS: Unfortunately, Universal kind of dropped the ball by not giving this more special features, as there are only two featurettes. Still, I am thankful for having something to dig into after such a short film. Exclusive to the Blu-ray is ""The Evolution of Lucy,"" which goes into the production, characters, Luc Besson's process and a little bit of the science behind the film. Apparently, Luc Besson talked with some neurologists about the concept which serves as the basis for LUCY, but I still don't buy it. That being said, scientists still don't know a lot about how the human brain works, so how much less would I know? The second featurette is ""Cerebral Capacity: The True Science of Lucy"" which, as expected, goes more into the theory behind the film and how much of it is based in science. While rooted in a very interesting question, what ended up in the film is more Luc Besson's imagination than established scientific fact. This featurette pretty much acknowledges this, but still doesn't discredit the ""10% of your brain"" theory either, opting for a ""we don't really know"" answer. Still, the brief discussion of the human brain was quite interesting.

OVERALL: As long as you don't go into this expecting the secrets of the universe to be unlocked for you (and I don't know any movie that would, or should, have those expectations), a general audience should have fun with LUCY. It would be almost too easy to dismiss this as LIMITLESS with a female lead, or to point out that Scarlett Johansson plays two registers throughout the entire film. As science-fiction, I thought it provided a nice balance between action and ideas, no matter far-fetched they are. There were some borderline pretentious bits, but without them the film probably would have felt even more slight than it already is. With LUCY, I feel like Luc Besson has redeemed himself from the previous decade of cookie-cutter action productions and provided something slick, mildly thought-provoking, and cool. Scarlett Johansson has also proved herself a capable action heroine. It is with these things in mind that I can comfortably recommend purchasing this.",1437868800,,4157,4.837078651685394

6549184,3,B00M25EALG,"Luuucy, you got some 'splainin' to do... Luc Besson has been touch and go for a while now, so, going into this film, I was both parts hopeful and trepidatious. Let me say that Scarlett Johansson was fine in the movie. She did what she could with the script she was handed. The first half of Lucy was fun, mostly, and ScarJo crushed it with her emotional range. It had me anticipating like mad that she and Besson were going to blow my socks off with a mindblowing third act. Instead, the movie left me seriously bummed.

Fun fact(?) dropped by Professor Samuel Norman: ""One hundred billion neurons per human, of which only 15% are activated. There are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy. We possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.""

Lucy slayed at the global box office, but that speaks more to ScarJo's drawing power than that the film was that good and deserving. The critics certainly panned the crap out of it. The plot revolves around a college student in Taipei who reluctantly becomes a drug mule. Thing is, the new synthetic drug - CPH4 - she's been smuggling in her tummy leaks into her system and unlocks her superhuman potential. Morgan Freeman plays a professor who espouses Darwinism evolution and posits that should we ever access more than 15% of our brain, a world of fukc-all becomes possible.

The movie tracks Lucy's evolution from party girl to... what? If I were to carve words on this film's tombstone, it'd be some remark about how as Lucy got smarter, the film got dumber. There's a palpable disjointedness, brought about by jarring execution and by this inept existential probing. I loathed the heavyhanded symbolism of the nature footage with the cheetahs and gazelles; it totally took me out of the story. Listen, before I crap even more on the film, let me mention the stuff I liked: ScarJo, the movie looks great; and Min-sik Choi, the hammer guy from Old Boy. These three elements lift up the movie enough that I'm rating it 3 out of 5 stars.

I wish the Amazon format would let me do bullet points. Anyway, what else don't I like about Lucy?

- First and foremost, Limitless did it better.
- While Morgan Freeman translates to instant authority, he's basically on rinse and repeat mode with this thankless expository role.
- I hated it that ScarJo was so inactive in her action sequences. But this is what happens when you're a psychic and can beat up on homies with just your mind. I wish she'd gotten more down and dirty.
- The French guy (Amr Waked) is there for no reason whatsover. He even references that fact (which does go some ways into making it okay).
- As Lucy unlocked even more uncharted regions of her brain, she forfeits more and more of her humanity. What this means is that, as the movie went on, ScarJo became more and more distant, a mash-up of Black Widow and her alien from Under the Skin. This is a minus for me in light of how much I relished her earlier more emotional state.
- Post-exposure to the CPH4, ScarJo has a touching moment during a phone call with her mom. She mentions that she remembers each of her mom's thousand kisses, and that was really sweet. But then she had to follow it up with the lactation comment. Ugh.
- ScarJo walks into a busy hospital holding a gun, and no one at all notices.
- The Superman dilemma. Maybe the most damning thing is that there is, ultimately, a lack of tension. Lucy becomes so omnipotent so rapidly that you stop getting worried for her. Those impecabbly tailored Asian gangsters barely pose a threat. In fact, no adversary is worthy of her.
- Just as with Ultron in Avengers: AoU, I've got beef with how effortlessly Lucy adjusts to her new sitch. I would've loved it if Lucy had spent time reacting and learning about her new abilities. As it is, we lose the fun of discovery.
- This one's really trifling, but still: Each time Lucy achieved a milestone in the percentage of her brain unlocked, the screen would flash the number. Look, Lucy's tapped into 20% of her brain, now 40%, now 60%. I think it would've been cool if the percentages had been more arbitrary. Look, she's unlocked 57% of her brain.

Luc Besson brings his most favorite things - the vivid visual aesthetics, the slo-mo gun action, the opera music... Give the film credit for its ambition, but then dis it for its flawed execution. Dang, I was so hyped to see this one. One thing's for sure, Scarlett Johansson can carry a film, can even take a turd and polish it enough that it becomes a global juggernaut.",1437091200,,4554,4.534063260340632

Finally sat through the movie, even with the exquisite Ms Johansson I could only muster 4 stars. It had a new theme, one that could have been exploited to make one of the best sci-fi movies ever, but alas, when it came time to go to the next level (and spend a lot more money) they opted to settle for average. I can see where a sequel could be made which might add to the enjoyment of this fare, but with Ms Johansson going into production of Ghost in the Shell soon, I don;t see a sequel in our future.

6549291,4,B00M25EALG,"Another movie that seems to have attracted contrasting reviews from film critics and reviewers alike....
I have to admit i love special-effects lavished Sci-fi movies, and look to be entertained, this one fits the bill, for me.
The film kicks off with 'Lucy' being coerced into delivering a briefcase to a Chinese Drug-Lord, it soon becomes obvious
from the outset she is obviously out of her depth, and in fear for her life.
She is effectively been made their prisoner, they implant a package in her mid-drift, it's intended that she be used as a
mule for them, whilst still in captivity and after the implant, one of her guards beats her, kicking her in the stomach, releasing
some of the synthetic drug into her body.
The effects make her something less than the frightened woman of earlier, she engineers an escape from her captors, on
the outside her first thoughts are to have the implant removed forcing a surgeon to perform the procedure.
The bag removed, much of the remainder of the contents now in her system, her very being is hugely enhanced, the substance
is gradually unlocking up to 100% of her brain-capacity........what has she become ??
She turns to writer and college lecturer 'Professor Norman' (Morgan Freeman) for help, he's written on the subject of 'Human and Animal's use of brain capacity.........can he help 'Lucy' or will her abilities be beyond his comprehension.
Her new-found powers and there use has made her wanted by the 'Law' and hunted by the Chinese Drug-Lord.....and perhaps little time to live.
An enjoyable and often exciting watch, that could 'blow your mind' - 'Scarlett Johansson' lights up the screen as 'Lucy'

Usually, these type of movies have a whole lot of sci-fi tech-speak that goes over most peoples heads (mine included) but I like that while they had Morgan Freeman explain it for the purpose of this movie, it wasn't really in the way of the story of Lucy (the character played by Scarlett Johansson).

When the movie begins, Lucy is what I'd call an average woman, full of potential, but wasting her life away being drunk and dating loser people like Richard, the guy that is responsible for Lucy's evolution throughout the whole movie.

Since this movie is only around 1 hour and 29 minutes long, there is surprisingly a lot of character development for the main character of Lucy. Scarlett Johansson shows all of the  emotions Lucy goes through as she evlolves while the expimental drug is going through her body, expressing love to her parents, becoming aware of her abilities, and toward the end of the movie, kissing the French Police detective to remind herself that there are things that being human are very much needed, as in the emotion of love.

Logically if you're more intelligent, you would become more creative and see more than just the surface. And one huge thing that got on my nerves every time they said it, and they said it alot: ""You only use 10% of your brain"" No, idiot. You use ALL of your brain just not at full capacity. The ability to draw uses a different part of your brain than doing math, however one person may have a greater capacity to do it.

Also to hear about how complex life is and yet somehow it just poofed into existence was very belittling. Okay, either life is simple and everyone should be able to duplicate and invent everything.

""Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.  Yet most species use only 3% to 5% of its cerebral capacity.

But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top pf the animal chain that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.

10% might not seem like much, but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.""

The above comes from this intriguing movie written and directed by Luc Besson (who has a small cameo).

This is an English-language French sci-fi action movie that was filmed in Taipei, Paris, and New York City.

Scarlett Johansson portrays ""Lucy"" who gains special intellectual abilities when a drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.  Morgan Freeman plays a respected professor of neuroscientist whom Lucy consults.

We get to see how Lucy changes as her brain capacity increases gradually to 100%.

Despite the nonsensical plot that focuses on the 10% brain capacity myth, this movie still managed to pull me in because of Johansson's performance, the intriguing themes, and the visual effects.  In fact, I think it's a credit to director Besson's style and Johansson's performance that this movie wasn't a train wreck.

An intriguing feature of this movie is that there are flashbacks to the female hominid (who lived 3.2 million years ago) whose common name was ""Lucy."" (Her discoverers named her after the Beatles' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."")  This movie implies that she was the oldest ancestor of humankind.

(Four people are credited with discovering the bones of Lucy in Ethiopia in Nov. 1974.  One of these discoverers was American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson.)

The DVD (released in 2015) has one ten-minute extra called ""Cerebral Capacity: The True Science of Lucy.""  I found it quite informative.

Finally, this film has performed exceptionally well at the box-office: it has earned back about 11.5 times its budget.

In conclusion, I found this an intriguing movie.  Yes, there are problems but damn is it entertaining!!

In a nutshell, Lucy is a woman living at the edge of the party scene, She is setup by a drug dealer for what she thinks is a maybe legitimate, maybe not delivery at a hotel to a rich man. The delivery turns into a bloodbath and she takes off with the briefcase. She winds up being forced to be a drug mule and is forced to swallow a large bag full of a new designer drug that is supposed to raise human brain activity to genius level in controlled dosages. What could go wrong? You'll find out of the bag of the drug rips open in her stomach when a cop beats here in a jail cell.

As it happens I'm reading a book called Superintelligence. by Nick Bostrom. I will publish a review of that book too. Increasing human brainpower should be possible but not because we aren't using our full capacity now.

I would like Beeson to write another film which is based on the premise that humans only use 10% of their urinary bladder. So after the hero gets to use his whole capacity he can drink two or three six packs before he has to pee.

Do I have to still have to believe that Scarlett Johansson is uniquely gorgeous? She's always seemed to me a rather ordinary looking young woman - I never understood why everyone made such a fuss.",1434672000,3,846,4.445161290322581
6549443,3,B00M25EALG,"This movie was billed as exploring intellectual aspects of science and ethics, but, what you get is a discombobulated mess of action and pseudo-science, while the 'aspect of ethics' in this film is apparently the absence of it.
The first act is by far the most intriguing as the protagonist (Johansson) is thrust into a situation which builds up tension and a decent thriller type of film begins to develop. But, as the second act begins the plot shatters into too many fragments and I began to wonder if I was watching a sci-fi movie, a super hero movie or an action flick, and (what happened to the 'thriller' I was really starting to enjoy?).
'Lucy' tries to be all of these genres, ultimately becoming none of them.
However, the movie isn't a total disaster. The plot moves along at a respectable pace. Editing, cinematography and FX are okay. Choi Min-sik's performance stands out and it's always a pleasure to see Morgan Freeman.
And I must admit that I'm a bit of a nut for Scarlett Johansson, which is the main reason I watched this film, so I'm certainly not going to cry over watching a movie with her in it.",1434672000,5,1118,4.567164179104478

The acting was pretty decent, as expected of the stars involved.  The soundtrack I didn't really notice;  didn't move me, didn't distract me.

It was the visual effects... they were well crafted, obviously made with professional talent... but were still terrible.  Were several times where I thought to myself 'of all the images you could have used to convey this concept, and you went with THAT one?'",1434585600,,550,4.978021978021978
6549460,3,B00M25EALG,"Lucy is articulated in the language of science fiction, but it is really science fantasy--heavy emphasis on the fantasy--for all intents and purposes. There is very little effort to make much of what happens believable, even by the standards of the typical sci-fi film. That being said, this one is good for a shot of sensory stimulation, rarely less than entertaining and occasionally beautiful. I only give it three stars because within the crazy premise and playing by the insane internal logic, I think that a better story could have been told. This one feels kind of like a loosely stitched-together film, not among Besson's better work as a director. If you are looking for some easy fun, Lucy is okay for that.

I'm trying desperately not to sound condescending when I say that the people who didn't like this film...  probably didn't get it.  (There, I did it anyway).  Besson does not cater to those that desire car chases and explosions in lieu of plot and a depth of meaning that keeps your mind stimulated long after the movie ends.  Don't get me wrong, in no way do any of his films lack in some of the best choreographed action sequences ever captured on film, but they don't simply exist for the sake of keeping our attention.

I was bored throughout the entire movie.  It's not so much that it is ridiculous and nonsensical (it is fiction, after all), but that nothing is believable in the context of the movie.  Even superhero movies are believable within their own context.  In addition, the main character starts off as relatable, but quickly loses that feature when she becomes emotionless (which goes unexplained).  The only people I feel bad for at the end of the movie is the other innocent drug mules.

6549584,3,B00M25EALG,"I am a big science fiction fan and the trailer of this movie was so expertly cut that I bought into the hype and actually paid to download it from satellite...big mistake!

You should definitely wait til this one is free on Amazon Prime streaming! It's not that the acting was poor, because the actors were great when you consider what they had to work with. The basic premise of the show was thought provoking and made you question why we don't use more of our brain capacity. Unfortunately, the story line and the relationship between characters was so lacking that it became nothing more than some pretty poor special effects portraying the evolution of Lucy.

And when the professor was lecturing,it drove me insane that they kept cutting in old snippets of footage that were intended to illustrate what his points were (as if the audience was far to dense to understand what he was saying without help). This could have been a really entertaining movie, but it came off as a low budget film with poor writing (heck, even the music and sound effects were boring). For me, if a movie is to be successful, characters must be developed, boundaries and relationships must be established,and I must be intrigued enough to be pulled into the story line. Instead, I kept waiting for something to happen. And the ending of Lucy becoming one with some giant computer network was so predictable and so mundane that you had to wonder if that ending was written because someone had writer's block. I tolerated the movie to the end, but there was never a moment when I enjoyed it.",1433548800,,1571,4.667870036101083

The action gets a little frenetic at times but Scarlett acquits herself well  now being a darling of the feminine action genre.

In Paris, the car chases and stand offs all seem designed to create a sense of action and suspense, but are not actually those things.  Just loud distractions.  The philosophical point being made is not particularly deep or interesting.  Clunky.

I'm not sure if the writer/direction wants to be Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight, Inception)?  Even has his characters speak their exposition and philosophical thoughts, the tension remains and the action seems important to the outcome.

It can simply be a product of imagination inspired by some scientific data.
In that sense, viewed like that, it is OK.

 As far as the action, it was top notch. I was blown away (pun intended), when Lucy walked through the doorway and took out 6 different bad guys in about 2 seconds, because she knew all the trajectories and velocities instantly.

6549718,3,B00M25EALG,"The action-thriller film by director/screenwriter Luc Besson has over-the-top action and thrills with chills, however actors Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman were given poorly used characters and with a nonsensical story that wasn't helped by how the main and subplot were interwoven together throughout the film.

The film revolves around the titular character, Lucy (Johansson), receiving psychokinetic abilities due to a nootropic drug getting absorbed into her bloodstream.  In and of itself, the plot is intriguing and gave Besson a lot play with as he wrote the script.  However he cut down the potential of the film by multiplying the locations and the need to show overindulgent action sequences that were in direct opposition to the information that Professor Samuel Norman (Freeman) had relayed through exposition delivered in the lecture he was introduced in or just took up too much time like the Parisian car chase.

The introduction of Lucy at the beginning of the film in retrospect was a tell-tell sign of the problems the film would have as she is forced by her boyfriend to deliver a suitcase for him after it's handcuffed to her, the biggest problem was that instead of delivering it she could have easily bashed it upside his head and gotten the handcuff cut off.  Next was her interaction with the Korean mob, which need not have taken place at all since it would have been easy to take off the handcuff and x-ray the suitcase since it was clearly too lightweight to be lead-lined.  And the interruptions of lions stalking gazelles while Lucy was in the lobby was needless over-the-top foreshadowing.  In fact initial setting of Taiwan wasn't really necessary with the film ending in Paris given the events taking place, it could have all taken place in Paris or ended in Seoul (or Tokyo).  Without an uncomplicated process of going to one location to another, the character played by Amr Waked could played a larger part in the film as Lucy's connection to human emotion as she continues to transcend humanity with the increase of her intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.  In fact, instead of using the ""10% myth"" Besson could have instead used the concept of brain efficiency along with internal genetic modification by the introduced drug to help explain Lucy's changes.

Once the end credits begin, the biggest take away from Lucy is that the film could have been better given the great performances by Johansson and Freeman.  But as I said at the beginning of this review, both characters were poorly used throughout a nonsensically plotted film.  Instead of just a simple thriller, Besson could have created a high level psychological thriller with plenty of action but went action first and story third.",1432684800,,2753,5.039647577092511

6549729,2,B00M25EALG,"Mild spoilers here!  This is my first movie review.  Good or bad I normally don't have much to say publicly about a film I watch.  However, this movie was really bad.  Sure, there were decent visual effects and Johansson is never hard to watch; thus the two stars.  However, both the science and the fiction in this movie were simply ridiculous.  The story lacked any real emotional commitment and development with the characters.  It was far more magical and Harry-Potter-like than anything else.  Moreover, It is interesting to note that Darwinian theorists will often claim that morality is an evolutionary development.  However, the more Lucy progressed, evolutionarily speaking, the more cold and calculated she became.  Indeed, it seemed she was primarily concerned with herself.  But if morality is a by-product of evolution then why didn't she become more caring and loving as the movie progressed?  Why was it that the first, new abilities that she has are primarily related to killing and achieving goals?  Wouldn't this be the more base aspects of our development?  Why are they the main focus in this movie?  Of course, if naturalistic evolution is true, then this is exactly what we would expect; no morality period.  And there certainly wouldn't be any ""super-powers"" on display.  The entire movie was hard to connect with if you are interested in the philosophical and scientific issues.  In the end, Lucy essentially has the properties of a monotheistic god; which is ludicrous!",1432512000,,1494,5.078189300411522

6549735,2,B00M25EALG,"The ""theory"" that human beings use only 10% of their brains (or some other arbitrary figure) was based on a misunderstanding of statements by several scientists in the 1920s and 30s, and has no basis in reality.  The fact is that we use 100% of our brains and that the entire brain structure is necessary.  The film starts with that premise, going from there to a ditzy college student on holiday in Asia, who accidentally absorbs a huge quantity of a synthetic drug that supposedly is similar to a chemical that induces bone formation in fetuses.  This causes her to progressively start using a higher percentage of her brain, which gives her superhuman abilities.

This is an old trope in science fiction, where someone is bitten by a spider, exposed to radiation, or undergoes some other process that normally would be fatal, but instead gives them superhuman powers.  Once Lucy starts her journey, we see her defy gravity, change her appearance at will, gain telepathic and telekinetic abilities, absorb knowledge effortlessly, and type really fast.  She also loses all vestiges of fear and compassion, yet for some reason is motivated to focus all of her energy on contacting Morgan Freeman, a scientist specializing in brain function, and ""downloading"" her knowledge to a thumb drive.  If this sounds silly, that's because it is, and in the film is interspersed with pseudo-philosophical pronouncements that will appeal to anyone under the age of sixteen who is on weed at the time.

""We were given life a billion years ago.  Now we know what to do with it.""  Yeah, I'll tell you what you can do with it.  Read a book or visit a waterfall or clean out your garage.  This film can only be recommended to the under-sixteen crowd on weed or fans of Scarlett Johansson who enjoy seeing her kick butt.",1432512000,2,1802,4.796116504854369

Plus, there's Morgan Freeman.  Who doesn't love Morgan Freeman, the actor (not him personally)?  Though, even he couldn't save this movie.  The ass-kicking pretty much stopped as soon as it started, then there was a lot of gun fire.  It somewhat reminded me of ""Transcendence"" with Johnny Depp.  I don't to spoil the movie, since, well, it'll do it itself--but I was disappointed after the initial hour, and the ending seemed to just leave you hanging with a poor resolution.

Of course, if you don't get it, they can just seem silly.  This is subjective, they are not for everyone.

I have felt both ways about Besson's films (Nikita is perfect, 5th Element is hilariously entertaining, but Columbiana simply didn't work - for me).  Fortunately, I liked Lucy, indeed I enjoyed everything about it - the concepts, the acting, the bad guys, the astonishing visual spectacle.  The film has a magic all its own, forming a whole that you can enter with wonder and glee regardless of how preposterous it is.

6549828,2,B00M25EALG,"I didn't hate the movie, there was lots of entertainment value but I laughed a lot and I don't think Luc Besson was going for a screwball comedy. From the the hackneyed idea that we use only ten percent of our brains, it was the lines and acting that really made this movie a stinker for me.
For example: Lucy calls her mother while in surgery to get the bag removed and she rambles about how she can remember and feel everything. Was that supposed to be an actual mom that talks to her? Aside from the fact that the mother on the phone is a secondary character, most mothers would say ""What kind of drugs are you are?? Are you ok? What the hell is wrong with you??"" especially when presented with the line, ""I can still taste your breast milk.""
The line ""I'm colonizing my own brain."" sounds like something a person would say at a party after smoking too much ""stuff"".
Another silly idea is to show just how smart Lucy has become, we need to show just how dumb she was before. In order to really hammer this home, Scarlett packs on the open mouthed, deer in headlights, gormless victim in panic at the beginning of the movie.
Also, just what kind of computers were Lucy using?? I have never seen a laptop, Apple or otherwise do all that, no matter how smart the person is who bangs on them at top speed. Usually you just get a frozen screen after awhile!
This movie was supposed to be fantasy but you gotta follow SOME type of laws of basic realness for it to work for me.",1431734400,2,1473,4.264285714285714

All the other players in this film were excellently directed and played all parts played well.  It is a wonderful mixture of cultures that few people understand.  I can only assume that is why some people did not find this film as satisfying as I did.  To some extent there is a point where you think you know what will happen and then it flips on you.  Even though it does go exactly where you think it takes a number of side trips that catch you off guard.  There is some excellent use of foreshadowing and clues that lead you on this journey with Lucy.  As is often the case with movies that are made from a book there is something lost in the translation.  It still satisfied me and did not leave me wanting.  Two thumbs up for the production, direction, action and story.  Only one thumb for the telling.  This not the fault of anyone except the studio for making formulaic movies and trying to minimize budgets.

The ending was a hot mess and actually summed up pretty well the vague, scattered, and...oh, heck, just plain boring...nature of the entire film. A lot of wasted talent.

6549889,3,B00M25EALG,"The plot and story were well-crafted, and there were several elements of the film that were exceptional, but overall it was not a great movie. Besson really reaches to make feature-length film out of the concept of a person evolving and transcending the physical form. Even with scenes that should have been left on a cutting room floor, action sequences that did not really fit the narrative, and copious amounts of stock footage of nature scenes, the movie is still only 82 minutes long. What saves it from being considered bad is that the story is compelling. But this kind of tale is best told as a short vignette.",1431302400,,618,4.678899082568807

And why does becoming smarter make you cold and emotionless ?? Oh and that Morgan Freeman line ""I just hope we will be worthy of your sacrifice"". What sacrifice? And how cheesy is that line?? She had no trouble killing 5 men early in the movies who to my knowledge hadn't killed anyone but let the other bad guys (who had just killed the other innocent drug mules) live in that hospital hallway only to have them kill all those cops in the last scene.

What if --- someone actually found that combination that not only boosts your IQ a few points, but puts your mind totally in touch with ALL source of knowledge?  What effect would that have on your physical body, and would you even need it?  This movie deals with metaphysical questions man has been asking for centuries, such as the very meaning of existence.

They film every scene featuring Scarlett with this blank dumb lifeless look/expression on her face. I get it (maybe) why but every shot is a close up zone around her head and there's just no fun. Its all part of the gig tho. Its just scene after scene of her blank face! It was so f-ing annoying. Personal opinion.

Less time needed to be spent on events leading up to the events that provided Lucy with the adherent behavior and more time showing how she learned and adjusted to her new abilities.

When I see Morgan Freeman in a movie, I usually look further into the film just because his flawless acting never leaves me disappointed. He changes the entire completion of a film that could make a movie about selling snow sound profound and interesting enough for me to watch.

But his presence in this movie only makes this clever story concept and well written script a brilliant film not to miss. A balanced mix of quantum physics, Syfy and reality turns this story into a riveting film that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a moment.

The ending was rather a let down too. The net feeling overall is that there was this great idea and a lot of enthusiasm at first on this project, then due to a lot of rewrites, etc people began to lose interest and/or ran out of time so the producers/director/writers just stitched things together to what  they felt was a reasonable exit point and cut their losses.

That all said, neither Morgan Freeman of Scarlett Johansson had to stretch their abilities to pull this of.  There are some pretty cool affects, but I watch it more for the concepts. With such a fabulous concept, it fell a bit flat. the writers/directors(?)  could have really taken this a lot further. It was more about the affects than the story.

This is clearly a instance where producers had a great idea, and rather than allow a good writer and director to develop that idea, instead opted for the fast track of hiring big names and edgy special effects.

The movie faded out in the theatres largely because people do not like to think.  Lots of action, great special effects (some of the best in recent years) and worth a BUY for your collection.

It is worth a BUY IMO because it is that kind of movie wherein your friends haven't seen it and wanted to  and you have it.  It is also great on a sound system and highly underrated for keeping your attention.  I find the visual effects kept me into it a bit more than the story after a bit, but that was fine.

Not just in my opinion, but opinion aside this movie had several mistakes throughout it. I guess not a lot of people go into this movie using their brain, especially the ones who believe the 10% of your brain myth.
Most of the CGI was pretty bad. The story was terrible. It made no sense why Lucy turned into an emotionless killer as she gained more use of her brain.. Her character portrayed no real personality. I didn't catch what country they were in because they said they were in Taiwan but everyone was speaking Korean and then all the doctors were Chinese.
It made no sense when Morgan Freeman was listing all the things that would be possible at specific percentages of brain usage and then someone raised his hand and asks ""what if someone could use 100%?"" To which he replies ""I do not know...""  Why not make up one more thing!?? He completely made up the whole list from 20% on and couldn't just make another thing up?  It goes on and on like this. I could write a book about how bad this movie is. As soon as you can use more of your brain, laws of physics no longer apply whatsoever.
Such a bad idea for a movie, many mistakes throughout the movie, none of it made sense, and it completely copies the movie Transcendence and Limitless. This is the worst of them all though.",1430092800,,1418,4.327067669172933

There were some parts that were a little hard to follow, only because it was very scifi to me. I just don't do super well with Syfy, but I did love the action sequences. despite the presence of Morgan Freeman is really a talking head to let us know about the potential of the human brain, none of this really made a ton of sense, but thankfully the movie didn't pretend that it should.",1430006400,2,756,4.4963503649635035

I notice things that the average movie goer doesn't, for example, when she squares off in the Hallway with the bad guys all of her opponents are clearly set in position for the scene, because Johansson is not athletic enough like Tom Cruise or whomever to pull of a great action scene without mediocre action scenes.",1429920000,,924,4.606060606060606

It's a fun action flick, don't over think it.
Scarlet plays Action Girl yet again with an easy grace that almost suggests ""Prince Valium"" (from Beetlejuice) is her archangel in real life. Not really though, such people are usually labeled ""scary"" or worse in real life if they have a naturally very calm demeanor no matter the events.
As far as future human evolution, consider natures' responses.  Would you really want to see humans with such ""supernatural powers? Come on. We all know the majority of humans would  be corrupted to some degree by it. It is exactly such corruption which evokes backlash. Backlash tends to box and/or exterminate those born too far outside the norm in any species.

6550244,4,B00M25EALG,"Lucy is an imaginative movie about the power of the human brain. Starting from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brain matter (a questionable premise to be sure), writer and director Luc Besson weaves a tale of a pretty and average young woman named Lucy living in Taipei. She lives a party life but her new boyfriend (they've known each other for a week) gets her into trouble when he gets her to deliver a briefcase to some shady characters in a hotel. Said characters kill the boyfriend and kidnap Lucy, forcing her to take a kilo of an experimental recreational drug in her stomach back home. Three other guys have a pack of drugs put in their stomachs and are headed to Europe. As she is hustled to the airport a rival gang grabs her and as they are beating her up, they accidentally rupture the bag and a massive dose of the drug enters her system.

The overdose doesn't kill her. Instead, it enhances her brains' ability to use itself, escalating to higher levels where she can repair and change her own body (like instantly changing her hair color at the airport when she needs to) and can influence other living beings and even the objects both near and far from her. She pursues the other drug carriers and Dr. Norman (played with proper gravitas by Morgan Freeman), a neuroscientist who has been working on theories of what enhanced brain usage would encompass.

The first third of the movie intercuts Lucy's story with a lecture given by Dr. Norman which outlines what's going to happen to Lucy as she becomes more powerful. The lecture is quite grandiose (referencing evolution's history from the first hominid) and far-fetched. Scientifically and philosophically it's just plain bonkers but it establishes the rules of this world neatly. Lucy grows in power, doing more fantastic things and sensing everything, including the flow of sap through trees and the lines of information going from cell phones into the sky. She develops amazing fighting skills (it's a Luc Besson film, after all) and control over all the fundamental forces of nature. What will she do with so much power and will the shady characters from the beginning of the movie get their drugs back?

Thematically, this movie reminded very much of Besson's The Fifth Element, in which Milla Jovovich's character is referred to as ""the supreme being"" because she has lots of extra DNA packed into her cells, giving her extraordinary powers. She struggles with her humanity and her nearly God-like powers and she is destined to save the Earth. Lucy is clearly becoming a God-like being who can manipulate reality (not only physical objects but even time itself) and can help save the Earth by using her power to give more knowledge to humanity. Both films have an underlying desire to explore and explain the transcendence of human nature over the rest of nature. While I find the conclusions wrong, the effort is still a lot more interesting than the B-movie trappings of the rest of the film.

The premise, however, is completely ridiculous. Neuroscientists have all sorts of opinions about how much of their brains people actually use and the idea that telekinesis or telepathy or more amazing powers would result from using more of the human brain is just wishful thinking. If the viewer can suspend disbelief for that (which I was able to), the movie is enjoyable with a mixture of crazy and interesting ideas plus a fun visual storytelling style.",1429401600,,3441,4.8074324324324325

6550254,2,B00M25EALG,"Besson has made some icon movies, one of which is one of my favorite action movies of all time, but recently not.  For me, this one really doesn't help his previous reputation.

Ms Johansson isn't bad and Freeman is Freeman even good with bad material. In fact most of the acting is at least ok, but... that's the best of it. The added imagery is just bad, and prehistoric 'Lucy' is badly rendered. There are some nice touches, Lucy on plane, but this whole 'lets throw all the laws of physics completely away' I have a problem with, I mean who believes in cause and effect anyway?

So please note: this so isn't Science Fiction, yes there's lots of Science speak, and if Freeman can't convince you: who can? :0) but since pretty much all of our known laws of Physics and Nature are ignored, I'd rate it less scientific than Harry Potter! (and less fun). Basically it's just movie stuff to justify the premise. Of course some people enjoyed it, and that's the nature of movies, and I must admit I didn't hate it, but there was too much eye rolling (mine) for me to really enjoy such a movie. I don't mind ridiculous stunts, in fact if done well I enjoy them a lot, and I like, possibly love, it when movies stretch our laws of physics: time travel machines, telepathy, teleporters, extra powers; I've been reading comics for over 40 years. They're movies they supposed to have fun with out reality, but Lucy is just plain ridiculous on pretty much every level, and not well enough executed to justify the premise.

If they could somehow learn how to develop and use the rest of their brain, they will accomplish much  but exactly what is unknown. Lucy does develop her brain due to the granules. The question is, what will she do with her enhanced power?",1429401600,,664,4.487603305785124

For things to make sense, you need to shut your brain off and tell it to stop thinking. Just remember it's a fantasy. And you'll enjoy it. I did. 4/5

For any families out there wondering, no. You should not let anyone under 11 watch this. And really, you should use your own discretion as a parent by previewing the movie first before letting anyone under 13 watch it.

Spoiler Alert! For the parents.

The opening sequence of the movie features some National geoGRAPHIC type content. Detailing some things like how animals 'get it on'.

Alot of blood.

ScarJo has to continually take the blue drug after it first enters her system, or she literally starts to melt away. Imagery would be nightmare inducing in the young.

MAJOR SPOILER

The most unbelievable part for me was that she turns herself into a flash drive at the end of the movie. A flash drive. It felt like maybe she should make a 'mini me'.  A clone of herself,  One that would be able to handle the information. But a flash drive is what she created as her 'child' instead. So. Yeah.

END SPOILER.

It tries to act like it is somehow based on real science when it is not. It's foundation is based on a misleading statistic that the average amount of brain activity is below 10% and that the other 90% allow us to defy laws of physics and more. They don't understand statistics because an average does not mean that we are not capable of using more brain power when we need. I know there should be room for ""artistic license"", but there was too much fantasy disguised as facts and no discernible moral value to the story despite its attempt to be conveying its enlightened origins.

They have this legend and they don't utilize his talent AT ALL, which is nearly a crime. But the overall premise I don't really feel ever took off anyway. The weird flashes to random stuff in the middle of the narrative was off-putting. Sorry, but I don't find warthog sex to be very entertaining in any capacity for any length of time; let alone watching random animals birth babies and stuff. I felt the stuff like that was VERY overdone and unnecessary. The ending felt a little fast, and left far too many questions. Like what the point of this movie even was. I realize the writer was trying to be deep and thoughtful and create a story about the meaning of life, but to be frank, all you get is grossed out and wondering why you're putting yourself through this movie. The pacing was strange. I'm not gonna be that jerk that tries put logic in a sci-fi film, but let's be real here that ending fight scene and her just waltzing into hospitals like it's whatever would NEVER HAPPEN. That just kind of felt like the director's excuse to waste studio money and be deliberately over the top. That kind of waste grates on my nerves. So yeah. I don't hate it. I have seen FAR worse.

6550536,3,B00M25EALG,"Luc Besson described Lucy as a mix between Leon, Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  I would more appropriately say it's a mix between I Spit on Your Grave, Akira, and Lawnmower Man.  Forgiving the initial concept, which is of course absurd, that humans only use 10% of their mental capacity; Lucy just can't get it's head on straight.  Starts out as an over obvious exploitation flick.  The first seen has Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) walking into a trap so blindly that she might as be only using 1% of her brain.  But still as an audience we think to ourselves, ""poor pretty white girl, what will they do to you?"".  Then when presented with a potential way out of her predicament she ends up chained to a wall and being stomached kicked for no discernable reason aside from , it will make us feel bad for her and it needed to happen to jump to the next part of the plot.  This is pretty much how the movie continues, Lucy develops into something between a psychopath, a drug addict, and the whole cast of the X-MEN.  But for all the while the none of these progressions really flow from the what we've seen before.
The movie really has two saving graces. One is that, as with any Besson movie, the visuals are pretty stellar.  After the first scenes the use of cut shots and non sequiter inserts is inspired.  The action scenes have a directness that is indeed reminiscent of Leon.  And the use of imagery in the main scenes themselves is pretty spectacular.  The other saving grace is Johansson. I say this as someone who is far from a fan of hers, but Scartlett Johansson saves the movie.  Her approach to the character is dispassionate but not so much so that Lucy turns into a robot.  She simply begins operating on a different level.  Johansson pulls this off subtly and with great deftness.  If you have two hours to kill, go ahead and watch the movie, but I wouldn't pay for it if I were you.",1428105600,3,1900,4.432276657060519

It wouldn't be so bad if it was just mentioned once or twice as a justification for the increased brain power, but the ENTIRE movie is filled with continuous discussion of the 10% brain myth. It even includes many cut aways to Morgan Freeman playing a professor in a lecture hall, spouting mountains of ""science"" that was made up by hack Hollywood writers. It really did make it impossible to enjoy this movie. We live in an age where the entirety of human knowledge is available to us at our fingertips, hence there is no excuse for this kind of nonsense. Oh and then there is a scene where Lucy lectures a group of scientists about how the universe really is, and she blows their minds with basic knowledge that anyone who has watched a few PBS or BBC documentaries should know. It was so hard to watch!

The action sequences were silly, needlessly grotesque, and lazily choreographed, and Johansson's very unsympathetic autistic superhero schtick gets old quickly.

This is a profoundly dumb movie. Limitless is an example of a movie with a similar premise, but without the junk science and general lazy film
making. If you are smarter than the average person, and be honest with yourself, Watch Limitless instead, it's Lucy for smart people.",1428019200,2,1326,4.786026200873362

The whole thesis of the movie may be too much for those who just want a thriller, because this one moves into projections about energy, soul and--yes: intelligence.

6550655,4,B00M25EALG,"I was surprised to see the ratings for this movie fairly even-spread across the board. My interest was piqued, as that is not something that happens often; more common to see love-hate. After watching the movie I guess I can see cause for disparity. It's not an all inclusive movie. The target audience narrowed to people who enjoy both action and high-minded drama with an absence of the nearly ever present love story. The primary issue for me was not enough minutes. With most movies these days exceeding 2-hours, 'Lucy' at only 90 minutes felt short. My guess is there was a lot on the cutting room floor, and it was likely a very difficult edit. Maybe room for a sequel? Luc Besson will need to look past the haters leaving reviews here. But honestly more time might have lowered or raised my 4-star rating, who knows...? Had I watched in a theater I might well have felt slighted, but still would have rated 3.5+, minimum. For the $5 spent today, it was well-worth the price of admission.
If you like to think as you watch a movie and rarely have difficulty staying with the content on-screen, then I believe you will enjoy this movie. If science is of interest and evolution is your basis for ""why we are here"", then you are likely going to enjoy the storytelling, imagery and creativity (i.e. Science Fiction / Fantasy).
As for the cast; Scarlett Johansen was her typical self: outstanding - never just a pretty face. She nailed this role with blank stares, devoid of emotion (a human computer). Empathy reduced to simple logic, with clear understanding fully evident during the phone call with her mother (early on, at only 27% brain-use, I think, at my ~7.5% it is difficult to recall). Morgan Freeman requires no praise - he's always good. Choi Min-shik played his part very well, believable. If you like him here take a look at 'Oldboy' and more recently 'New World'. Amr Waked was also very good, you might have seen him in 'Syriana', and plenty of other, mostly foreign-made films.
Personal Editorial:
As an atheist I greatly enjoyed the purity of a science-based view - no God, no love interest. Contrast this film with the likes of 'The DaVinci Code' and considering the content flashing by on-screen, detailing evolution via cause & effect, was satisfying in some way. When you consider the last seventy five years or so, and how far we have come, then factoring in the billion-years prior, it is mind-numbing to think of using more of our brains. Sadly that would probably result in a deep understanding that we - people - are going to be a problem. The Earth does not care, and neither do we (collectively, I do not mean you personally). :-)",1427760000,,2660,4.6617021276595745

I don't think this movie did much more to develop the theme than we came up with as 4th graders. The acting was a bit disappointing too. Limiting Morgan Freeman to a handful of lines was a mistake. While Luc's other movies are worth watching (some even multiple times...think Lon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, etc.), this movie is poorly written, the effects seem like a small step up from Lawnmower Man, and the last third of the movie takes implausibility to a new level.

6550682,5,B00M25EALG,"I Love Lucy!!!!!!!!!

I am not talking about the sitcom entitled ""I Love Lucy"" that featured Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz that was shown from 1951 to 1960 but rather the science fiction action film entitled ""Lucy"" that was written and directed by Luc Besson. The film that stars the alluring Scarlett Johansson tells a story about a woman caught in a dark deal that gains 100% of her cerebral knowledge that led him to possess psychokinetic abilities from a brain-enhancing drug that is being absorbed into her bloodstream and turns the tables around her captors. Morgan Freeman,Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked co-stars.

No question that the story focused on the theme about what would happen if humans were able to use 100% of their brain instead of the usual 10%.Despite the fact that the plot was somewhat silly and simplistic,it will definitely manage to entertain moviegoers who are watching a film with the hope of being entertained and not hoping for a classic. Some critics and viewers will despise it nevertheless but they themselves would get have been entertained one way or another especially Luc Besson's theory of what abilities Lucy will acquire as her cerebral abilities rises up from 1% up to 100% in the end. The film obviously has great Computer Graphic Imagery (CGI) effects and has lots of action scenes. The performances of the cast was also great from Johansson,Freeman and even from Old Boy star,Choi Min-sik. This is definitely one of the most pleasurable and entertaining action movies I have seen so far this year.

6550693,1,B00M25EALG,"I knew I was in trouble in the very beginning when this movie began to pan back and forth from the movie itself to some bizarre ridiculous montage. Especially the part where Lucy is getting sucked into delivering a brief case with drugs to the bad guy. The director must have been smoking crack that day - Lucy looking frightened - cheetah staring at an antelope - Lucy looking frightened - cheetah stalking antelope - Lucy being abducted - cheetah killing antelope.  This went on throughout the movie. And the plot - ugh - oh the horror.  Really? This is the same director that did The Fifth Element?  What happened?  Lucy could have been an awesome heroine. Instead she looses touch with her humanity. Her affect becomes robotic and boring - I could use a fancy word for boring but her character doesn't deserve it. As she 'evolves' (loose quotes) she starts talking science like a drunk professor - Lucy makes very little sense, her dialogue reads like a collection of popular theories but there is no coherence. Morgan Freeman barely gets to interact with Lucy. You don't really learn much about his character and his scenes are also littered with their own supremely silly montages - more crack I take it. Essentially they show all the best parts in the trailer. Don't waste your time or your money. Wait for HBO or TV.  Then you can watch the silly cheetah - antelope montage and get a good laugh and switch to another channel during the mind numbingly stupid parts which essentially take up about ninety percent of the movie.",1427587200,14,1532,4.659259259259259

Unfortunately, it was something else.
The first 30min were OK, but then it quickly became distractingly and irritatingly absurd.  There wasn't even any attempt to make it interesting by developing some fantastic/magic mythology about how a juiced-up brain could somehow acquire so many abilities (like defying gravity?!).

Lucy is just enjoying her life when she is trapped by a man she trusted, and forced to carry a briefcase handcuffed to her wrist to a criminal that you would never want to be in the same room with. She is injected with a substance that frees her brain. It causes her to be able to use All of her cognitive power, rather than the very small percentage that humans actually use. This basically gives her super powers, and makes her a very scary adversary.

I've played it several times, coming away with a bit more each time.  Special Effects were outstanding.  Special Effects Make-up was superb.

I suggest you go with where the story takes you, get involved.  Cut scenes are fast and often you'll miss what they showed you.  But they did show you and even if you didn't dwell on each scene, you subconscious mind saw it and that's why the movie works so well and effects you at a primal level, as it was intended to effect you.

For a movie about elevating human intelligence the film is not terribly thought provoking. But it's definitely entertaining and well acted. Luc Besson (The Professional, The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita) films usually give us highly stylized mayhem and violence. No different here. Scarlett Johansson plays a mostly clueless college age party girl living in Taiwan who unwittingly becomes a drug mule for Korean gangsters. By accident the synthetic drugs implanted in her cause a biochemical reaction that will ultimately elevate her brain function to 100%. Course as everyone knows normal humans are only able to access a fraction of that now. While her cognitive functions ramp up to full capacity the Police and the gangsters pursue her. Morgan Freeman plays a Doctor prominent in the field of brain research who's given the opportunity of a lifetime to study a human with this much intellectual capacity.

6550843,1,B00M25EALG,"I recommend to see the deeper aspect of this movie, which is: this reality is an illusion or a dream in which the underlying consciousness of God within us is living in. In this dream there are two forces, one (The Matrix) that wants you to stay in the dream state because it is sustained by giving it your attention and energy to keep itself alive, and the other force is the force of God within you (the Breath of God) which wants to awaken you, you have the choice to take the red pill or the blue pill. The red pill will awaken you to realize that reality is nothing but multi layers of a dream (watch the Inception movie). The deeper the level of dreaming, the more limited one will be and the more  stuck he will be to his limiting beliefs. But, the more lighter the dream level one is into, the more freedom and power one will have to bend the rules of the Matrix (cause and effect) that fooled us to believe in it and be slaves to it.

Upon awakening from a deeper dream to a lighter level of dreaming, going upward, one will discover by the end that in reality there is nothing but God alone in existence (The Truth) and that everything else is a dream within a dream within a dream..., everything else from our seperate self from God all the way down is nothing but an illusion and a dream. All spiritual masters came to awaken us to this reality, but the Matrix has it's own way to distort their message by conditioning our minds to misunderstand things. Such misunderstanding has been fed to us by our herd conditioning mentality, to think in one way, and that anything else different is either evil or heretical.
The way out of the Matrix is by first, one has to choose to disconnect himself from the Matrix by choosing not to participate in its attractive drama which uses fear and desire (good luck for TV addicts), because where attention goes energy flows. Giving our energy to it, we become nothing but batteries that are feeding and sustaining the Matrix, and this will make us more conditioned to be stuck in it and believing in its fears and limiting beliefs, thus we become entangled.

Most people who became drained batteries and don't know the way out of their misery rush to use distractions such as drugs, alcohol, sex, etc to escape the anxiety and fears that lock them in it, this includes rich and famous people. The way out of it is to give more attention to the God Consciousness with us, which will pull us out of all these layers of dreams, and we will realize that we are much bigger than what we thought we are (miracles become a norm), that we are the Soul that created all these layers of drama or dreams discovering it's own greatness in its journey back to itself.
Life is boring when you, as a Soul, have all the power to get whatever you want and you know everything (I recommend that you watch a Twilight Zone episode on you tube called: A Nice Place to Visit.) so to create excitement; the game of life must be created but its up to us to learn how to enjoy it by taking this spiritual journey willingly; by learning how to play it and participate in it. The other option is to suffer for so long if one chooses to avoid his spiritual journey.
It was said that if you don't go to spirituality, it will come to you. If we take this spiritual path and move in the right speed, according to our level of evolution, then we will have a beautiful journey. Otherwise, if we choose not to take this journey, or if we choose to slow down in our journey below our level of evolution, then life will be hard on us. So, understand it like this, if you don't feel good, then you are either not doing enough spiritual work, or you are off track. Please don't compare yourself to others unless you are at the same level of evolution like them.

The spiritual journey is about recognizing the consciousness of God in you, being grateful, positive, loving, forgiving, and serving. While the path of the Matrix/Ego is about fears, selfishness, over indulgence, ungratefulness, and negativity.
The game of life is a very exciting game for those who know how to play it well.

I recommend reading God and the Evolving Universe by Redfield, and watching the movie: The Celestine Prophecy.
 On this spiritual journey, some pathways are easier than others, some of them religious, others are not, choose whatever your inner ""Godience"" will guide you according to your level of evolution at that moment.

Wish you a beautiful journey!",1427155200,,4454,4.450980392156863

6550862,4,B00M25EALG,"I want to forewarn all viewers that are going to see this film. Do not expect direct theories, expect the directors outlook, forget the scene, rationale, everything else. You've had all your life to know science and contribute to functioning of the mind, biology etc. Don't begin with LUCY in trying to explain and expecting logic in the studies involved. That out of the way, this film is nothing short of absolutely brilliant story unfolding. Oh my God! I absolutely loved the action scenes. There is one scintillating action scene involving cars, then there's a scene involving going back into time, then there's a scene involving the protagonist who's having memory recollections from time long gone - she is on the phone with her mother and as she is remembering everything her stone cold resilience gives way to emotions and she cries on the phone, it is the most amazing scene, there is so much exaggeration but I think the casual viewer, the cynic and the interested person will see what they want to. Just don't expect a lot of ""good things"" and allow the director some license of fiction.

I loved Limitless and have seen it several times. It has a higher rating than Lucy but the idea is somewhere similar I thought. I was in no rush to watch this film. My wife and I saw this film last night on DVD at home. Where do I conclude? The action scenes, the shots, the revelation of the story was all so much fun.

6550903,4,B00M25EALG,Lucy is a really good movie. The story is nicely done and Scarlett Johanson does a wonderful job of making her character seem completely believeable. As believeable as possible for Sci-Fi/Action thriller. Scarlett makes turning from a party-loving 20-something to a completely evolved and omnipotent being realistic and captivating. Watching this movie you really do hinge on our heroine's every move and word. The movie is fast paced with no disruptions. The only complaint I have it's a big one is that the movie is so short. I really don't understand why it's so short. In an age where movies are routinely lasting (2hrs 30mins) this falls way short. I'm not saying the movie needed to be that long but another 30mins would have been really nice. Just as Lucy reaches her full potential the movie is done and your left wanting a whole hell of a lot more. Maybe that was the directors plan but if it was it was dumb and not needed. You get so caught up on this wild ride with Lucy that when it's abruptly done you feel very unsatisfied. This is a definite must buy/must see.,1426982400,,1076,4.609375

6550947,5,B00M25EALG,"I loved this film mainly because the short blurbs I read made it sound as if she were some alien, just lurking around waiting to abduct and do unspeakable things to male humans.  This didn't sound all that interesting, and there is nothing like LOW expectations to make a movie appear a lot better.  But it has more going for it than just that (or just Scarlett or just Morgan Freeman).  2:  Nor do I think it is even meant to be taken literally, even in a speculative way; it's more allegorical perhaps, and asking us to think of how many things about the universe might be true that we haven't yet a clue about.  We are almost as smug today about our understanding as the ancients were of their (mostly wrong) ideas about the world like the earth being the center, the 7 spheres of heaven rotating about it, all matter being admixtures of earth air fire & water, etc.

3.  And yes, the cinematography is generally spectacular.  Some sequences are deliberately obscure, making you wonder what exactly is being depicted.  Others are clearly allegorical and yet others, pure action (like a great wild car chase scene), but the juxtaposition of varying visuals to convey messages was, for me at least, a welcome story telling technique.

Straight up, this is first & foremost a science fiction film, but one designed to be taken a little more seriously than Fifth Element.  Good acting, great cinematography, great pacing, decent dialog but meant to entertain.  For me it did just that.",1426809600,5,1484,4.687258687258687

Of course in this movie it is accomplished with some great mind altering drugs. Who knew? It seems that mind altering drugs are actually good for us. Bottom line is this plot line and most of the dialogue of this movie are nothing more than trash. LUCY discovered how to take box office stars and turn them into boring, meaningless characters. The first few minutes of the movie Scarlett is a poor little dumb victim and the remainder she is an emotionless, grim faced lunatic, hell bent on finding out the true destiny of man and turning herself into an ugly black mass of oozing computer matter!

Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, is an obvious take off on the name of the first human-like primate. She unwittingly becomes exposed to a drug that allows her to access more and more of her brain capacity, and in turn gain abilities that make her less and less human. She does a good job of going from kind of a ditzy, college party girl in the beginning of the movie, to an almost robotic omnipotent being toward the end of the movie. Much like Kubrick's 2001, the plot ultimately does not matter toward the end and just kind of revolves around the visuals and her journey through time.

It is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone. It is part sci-fi, part summer action, part science experiment. It is certainly not based on pure scientific fact, more hypothesis. It does present the question in a very unique way though. Also do not expect it to be a pure butt-kicking action movie, because while it certainly does have some of those elements, it is not purely in that category either.

For those who do get the disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray. It is obviously effects heavy, and visually stunning, and those aspects come out very well. There are not much in the way of extras. A behind the scenes feature called the Evolution of Lucy, and a feature on the science behind the movie, good for what is there, but definitely a little lighter than what you would get from other movies.",1426464000,2,1659,4.415032679738562

I'm not sure what the strengths of the film are. Morgan Freeman is good. I've liked Ms. Johansson's work in previous movies but her characterization post event is robotlike which didn't work so well for me, and I didn't like the way the movie showed how she came to deliver the case. when Richard first handcuffed her to the case she had the option of fleeing and calling the police, she didn't have to enter the building. Didn't care for the music. visuals weren't bad. for story I give it a 3 but for story presentation I think it's more a 2 so I rounded up. worth a watch if you like gorgeous-woman-shooting-a-gun movies but I would've liked to have cared more about Lucy. didn't suck but wasn't good either. 2 and 1/2 stars",1426377600,,1016,4.467741935483871

This movie distinguishes itself in that it was able to defy the rudimentary principles behind EVERY TYPE OF SCIENCE (computer science, physic, chemistry, biology, etc...) KNOWN TO MAN in only one movie; I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself. Not only does it fail elementary school science, it replaces film story telling with narration. Here, the filmmakers are acknowledging that anyone who can believe the premise of this film would need help understanding this/any movie. So Morgan Freeman narrates 80% of what's happening. (e.g., Scarlett Johansson stares into the camera. Morgan Freeman explains, ""Lucy is now accessing 20% of brain capacity""). *yawn*",1426377600,,817,5.104477611940299

Have a good 'un!

Seriously, give me a break. Let me reproduce 2 lines of dialogue to bolster my contention this thing was shot on a pace that would've had Ed Wood in ecstasy. Scientist, Morgan Freeman, is speaking to Lucy on the phone.
""I left the hotel earlier, so I am no longer there, now."" Say.... WHAT!? That was the line. Kid you not. Followed almost immediately by this zinger:
"".... some of the top MENS in their field."" (He had assembled a group of about 3 or 4 male scientists.) OK, my subtitles read ""top MINDS,"" which, I feel sure, is what ol' Morgue was SUPPOSED to say, but, what the hey, we ain't got all day. Close enough. CUT! Wrap.

6551218,5,B00M25EALG,"I have seen this movie twice at the theater, bought the dvd and watched it at least a half dozen times and very much enjoy watching the special effects of what Lucy is able to do as she unfolds the full capacities of her mind.  I find this fascinating because having explored mental/psychic abilities personally I know about the awesome power we possess which the vast majority of mankind are totally unaware of.  The only disagreement I have with this movie is the fact that it is crafted around the concept that the brain is the source of all this power.  I totally disagree and posit that these abilities are spiritual not material.  This movie pushes the belief that we are merely physical, material beings and only by expanding the capacity of our brains can such powers be manifest.  On the contrary the brain limits our abilities not enhances it because we are basically spiritual beings.  Because of intentional fear and misinformation inculcated in us by religion, governments, corporations, media, etc. and our own inherent fear of the harm our minds might do we fail to explore our full potential.  I can't say I have reached my full potential  either but I have experienced it to some extent.  The stories about Jesus and various saints through the past centuries seem to exemplify this.  In summary I consider the concept of the movie valid with the exception that it is based on the current scientific dogma of materialism.",1426032000,,1437,4.781376518218623

There. I just saved you 89 minutes of your life that would have otherwise been irretrievably lost.

This movie really has nothing at all to recommend it, unless the only thing you're looking for is special effects. And even those aren't that extraordinary in comparison to what else is out there. There's no plot to speak of, the script is banal, and the characters are lifeless. Morgan Freeman somehow manages to breathe some life into an essentially hopeless role, but that's far more a measure of his talent than what he had to work with. I sure hope he found himself a new agent after this one. And I still don't get the point of Scarlett Johansson.

I finished watching lucy and let me say this movie proves that Scarlett Johansson has the ability to lead a movie on her own without any help.
This is a pretty good movie with a woman who starts out being a little dumb to becoming something else entirely with the help of a drug and a lot of guns. While most of the science go over my head it, provide away way for the character to rock and roll. The only thing I don't like about it was the ending I hate ambiguous endings.

6551394,5,B00M25EALG,"This movie is an intriguing blend of science fiction and gangster film: A beautiful heroine who is not quite innocent, drug-smuggling thugs that are completely ruthless, and some seriously high-tech special effects combine to make ""Lucy"" an excellent piece of movie making.
The plot is fairly straightforward. Lucy, who first appears in the film partying while doing some heavy drinking in a bar, and her skeezy boyfriend are outside an office building when he asks her to deliver a briefcase to a mystery man. She doesn't want to but he eventually forces her to do so in a somewhat bizarre way.
Reluctantly, she enters the building to deliver the briefcase and, suddenly, everything goes pear shaped.
I won't reveal what happens next because that could spoil the movie for you but I will say that Lucy, after receiving a beating, transforms from party girl into something much, much more. It is her transformation and how she deals with it that makes this movie first rate, in my opinion. Scarlett Johansson brings a subtle depth to her performance as she goes from flighty raver to frightened girl to something else entirely. Morgan Freeman handles his role as a world-renowned scientist with his usual skill. His performance is understated but effective as he portrays the only person on Earth who might just understand what is happening to Lucy.
As with many Luc Besson films, this movie is also a morality play of sorts. Every action has its consequences: Lucy parties hard and, as a consequence, she winds up in what at first seems to be mortal danger. The thugs are ruthless and greedy and that comes back to haunt them as the movie progresses.
The direction is flawless, in my opinion, and the special effects are well done.
I highly recommend it.",1425945600,2,1755,4.8533333333333335
6551395,1,B00M25EALG,Horrible movie. Wish I had that hour and half of my life back,1425945600,3,61,3.769230769230769
6551396,5,B00M25EALG,"Luc Besson's Lucy had me reminiscing about another little gem from 2011, Limitless. They both involve a similar theme, but the stories spread far and wide from each other at that point on. They both involve a designer drug and an unwilling receiver of said drug and the effects of the drug upon the recipient and all the people he/she influences along the way. In the case of Lucy, it's just about the entire population of the world.

From other reviews that spell out the entire story behind the film--I don't particularly like those kinds of reviews--you can get an idea of what it's about or the whole shebang in an unannounced **SPOILER** review. All I really have to say about the film is my point of view and why I have that point of view. Lucy was a smart, well-thought-out film. It had an ultimate potential to be a disaster if the topic at hand wasn't approached and presented in a singularly intelligent manor. In the ""Extras"" portion of the Blu-ray, Mr. Besson said the entire idea and path to fruition (my words) took 10 or 20 years, or something like that, and after watching the flick, I can see why. Sure, the premise necessitates some level of fantastical belief, but at the same time, there could be (although scientists have no idea) some level of truth to it. It is science fiction with a hint of wonder thrown in for good measure. Isn't that what a good story is about anyway, not just the suspension of belief, but an inkling of truth, zigzagging its way through the fiction with subtle determination?

Lucy is that and more. It's a thinking man or woman's film. I found myself thinking, ""What if?"" many times while watching. It was a good, solid movie, with excellent graphics, an awesome car chase through Paris, going the wrong way through heavy, one-way traffic, a professing Morgan Freeman, who was perfectly cast for his role, and Ms. Scarlett Johansson, whose part was clearly not easy to pull off. At times, you could even tell she was having trouble doing what she needed to do, which was acting with the complete absence of emotion, but still with some level of care for the good of humanity built into it. Sometimes, and I hate to use a cliche here, but she looked as plain as day (I never really saw her as overly attractive, like some people, particularly men, see her, anyway), but other times, primarily during the ""little black dress"" shots, she presented as quite amazing. However, we all know that movie stars are made to look glamorous or even seductive, but when they are out and about like the rest of us, they look just like the rest of us.

Lucy is a movie I could watch again and again. Aside from a bit of overkill, where the violence is concerned, there are many levels up and depths down to the story. It is layered, and it is actually presented to the audience in a layered manner, which made it even more interesting to watch. You would have to see it to understand exactly what I am referring to, or as mentioned before, just go read one of those ridiculous unannounced **SPOILER** reviews.

6551398,5,B00M25EALG,"The movie starts out a bit slow, with a lecture and graphics presented by Professor Normon (Morgan Freeman) on evolutionary leaps made throughout the history of biological life on our planet, and their theoretical causes.  But don't let this slow start fool you, and don't discard the lecture, things seriously take off from there.

Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a young American woman studying abroad in Taiwan, dating someone who tricks and forces her into delivering a briefcase to a mysterious Korean gangster named Mr Jang (Min-Sik Choi).  The person who tricked and forced Lucy into this shady transaction is then shot down (karma is unforgiving), and Lucy is forced to go to Mr Jang's suite, with the case, to what she is certain is her soon-to-be equally violent death.

Grows wires and bestows the world with a thumb drive?  Vanishes and then text messages the only police officer who did not die a horrendous death trying to protect a wanted murderer?

Lucy isn't any of them. For that movie, I create separate category and I call it ""Lucy"". From now on, I'll be measuring all badness by comparing it to this movie.

Seriously people if you have some self respect and want to keep it, then please don't go to cinema.

I absolutely hated this movie.  The initial premise of ""what if someone could use 100% of their brain?"" is faulty from the get go.  However, as Lucy supposedly becomes ""smarter"", the film only becomes dumber.  Violence is had, bizarre stuff happens, and the entire thing is too ridiculous to ever take seriously. As a film, ""Lucy"" is incredibly flawed. Story telling techniques are abandoned within the first 10 minutes, characters behave inconsistently / irrationally, and the dialogue is just laughably bad.  At one point, Lucy calls on her mother and if you can get through that dialogue of Lucy remembering things she shouldn't remember without laughing, then you are a better person than me.  Characters are introduced and quickly forgotten.  At other points, characters point out how needless they are to the story and you can't help but agree with them.

I feel like a lot of people give this film a pass because it's ""Luc Besson"".  Whereas if this film were directed by Michael Bay, we would instantly rip on it for the mindless nonsense that it is.  In a few years, no one will remember this film and I believe your 80 minutes are best spent watching something else.",1425686400,2,1379,4.805084745762712

Morgan Freeman did only a so-so job in this movie, though, and I was a bit disappointed that his role wasn't up to his acting abilities.

The movie seems to ask if we are all gods or part of something holonomic.  (It's interesting that the ancient Egyptians believed that all humans possess 366--or is it 368?--senses and use only five.  Maybe using ""100 percent"" of our brain [actually, the movie probably meant ten percent of consciousness, in the Huxleyan sense, rather than corporeal brain] means using all these latent senses.)  There's also the Gurjieffian and Colin Wilson theme:  we seem to be only 10 percent awake.  I loved the ending--where she ""is"" now--it's so beautiful!

6551523,3,B00M25EALG,"You remember when you were a teenager and all your friends were partying and having so much fun drinking and doing drugs and you were like, WHY NOT ME, and so you joined in that one night when they were all wasted and experimenting with that new drug that was supposed to get you SO HIGH and then you accidentally snorted way to much of it and passed out and everyone thought you were dead but you werent, and when you woke up you were a superhero?

Yeah, I don't remember that time either.

Ive never done drugs.  Its never appealed to me.  I have friends who have, I also have a sister who was an addict and I have known some family friends who are no longer with us because of drugs.  Yeah, Im happy to say Ive never done them.  Had I, for one second, thought that they would give me the ability to do anything that Scarlett Johansson does in this movie, I would have overdosed when I was eight.  Simple as that.  I would have gone all Scarface on a table of coke and, well, it wouldnt have ended pretty.  It doesnt end pretty here either, but like, this is a movie and so, whatever.

I guess thats kind of the problem too, because this movie is kind of whatever thanks to the fact that everything is so preposterous it makes you want to punch things.

This was honestly almost as dumb as Transcendence, but this was far more fun to watch, so it gets extra points for that.

The film tells the story of Lucy, a girl who within a few minutes of the movie is handcuffed to a briefcase and brought before some crazy Asian guy who kills the guy she slept with the night before and forces her to become a drug mule for some new drug made from pregnancy hormones.  She transports the drugs, but the guys designated to extract the drug get fresh and then beat her up, causing the pouch in her stomach to burst and Lucy to overdose, but instead of dying she becomes a superhero.  Yup, the drug allows her to use more than the average percentage of brain, which, for some reason, instead of merely making her smart makes her a superhero.

NONE of this makes any sense, including that ridiculous finale when she goes back in time or whatever and turns everything white and, like, becomes a machine and then air or whatever, but OMG this movie is a trip and just fun.

Stupid, stupid fun.",1425513600,,2280,4.267441860465116

6551560,4,B00M25EALG,"For those of you who have interests in nootropics, ascension, raising consciousness, question the meaning of life in a serious manner, this movie should be experienced at least once in your lifetime.
I  feel like anyone who rated this one star has no idea not cares for what the mind is actually capable of. I saw one review say she turned into God. No. She didn't. She turned into the highest ascension of herself, she never claimed she was God. There isn't a ton of cutaways like I saw others say there is. They have some, but in my opinion, they are there for symbolic effect. People can't seem to grasp the concept of symbolism.

""There wasn't enough action."" Well, you have to consider that fact that the timeline of everything happening in the movie was only about three days. They even mention in a part that she had less than 48 hours... She had to s*** done the quickest way possible. Sorry buildings weren't exploding and sorry for the lack of massacres.

The graphic effects only benefited the film. Even though they did seem a little ""out there"" - definitely something that would be easily overlooked and considered ""s***ty"" for people who are incapable of fathoming what energies inhabits this universe. Though, half of it may be scientifically impossible, science transforms everyday with new discoveries. Maybe it's not possible today, but tomorrow 

I give this move 4 stars because it does feel like it was missing something... I will agree with it being anticlimactic. I mean... It was there. It just went too quick and left you a bit confused at the end. It leaves more questions than answers.",1425427200,,1612,4.742857142857143

Went to see this first time at the cinema, after having read some not so good reviews.
I think that Scarlett Johansson was perfect in the role of Lucy, as we she her change from a modern city girl through all the stages of a human increasing her use of her brains capacity following an accidental exposure to a new drug.
Morgan Freeman is of course perfect as the professor she contacts, that scene alone is fabulous.
Although neither will win any awards for this film, it's entertaining, well acted and does make you think about human potential.
It's science fantasy, action adventure and the special effects aren't bad either.

As for the story....well, I think it has enough ""meat"" to it that it will make some think.  Personally, I liked it.  I really liked the symbolism to achieving ""pure energy"" status - being the ultimate form of life.  But, it need not be all that to you.  To each their own.

Similar movies include ""Limitless"" starring Bradley Cooper and ""Altered States"" starring William Hurt.

It has long been known by the top 1% of the world's most intelligent inhabitants that we're doing it wrong; not just in ruining the planet but in our allegedly-rational responses to the ruining of Earth. Even the world's top scientists and so-called experts are looking at the problems facing our very existence using the wrong tools, which have been passed down since ancient schools of both eastern and western thought 20,000 years ago.

This film exemplifies that erroneous belief system and takes it to task by showing us, exactly, in what way we are ""doing it wrong."" Although it's science fiction, it's rooted in the undeniable truth that everything we believe, and therefore, everything we do, and therefore, everything we think is, therefore, wrong. By asking ""What's the point?"" and by endlessly searching for ""the point,"" we are missing the point altogether.

That's the awesomely-presented point of this film, and I couldn't be happier to see it.",1425340800,24,1336,5.0867579908675795

Consistent with Buddhist and other philosophies about the end purpose of advancement or ascension to a higher plain of existence which incorporates the loss of attachment to feeling of pain, love, want, aspiration, etc.  The lesson, not all would want the higher plain of existence in their current view of their self and world they have.  The screenplay acting and special effects were very well done.  A very thought provoking movie.  Another step in the direction of Matrix of mankind finding who and what we are and where are we going for what purpose.  I think, therefore I am.

The story line is fairly common.  The director has the engaging and beautiful Scarlett Johanssen to pull of a knock out.  Lucy is sexy, hot, and in trouble.  What better way to draw in that 18-45 year old demographic?  Unfortunately, Scarlett's acting isn't up to the task and we see way too little of her female assets to maintain interest.  Combined with a plot and story line that fades and never develops well this movie is nearly a stinker.

Most disappointing of all, the kick-ass aspect of Lucy is never really unleashed.  The are glimpses of where this movie could have been taken.  The sci-fi is enticing yet not completely explored.  You really want to see Lucy kick some more ass but it never happens to a satisfactory level.  Finally, the movie ends with a whimper and on a week note for the story.  It doesn't even hint toward a Lucy2 if that is what they had in mind.

Overall:  Hot chick, OK acting, common story line, and some kick-ass potential that only teases but never delivers.

The result is a confusing story that ceases to make sense as soon as Lucy can control those around her. After that, all of the action scenes become pointless, as she, ""can control those around her"". Then once she is able to control things like gravity. Well. Let's just say there isn't much tension created by the bad guys anymore.

I think it's a good idea, half-hatched, that ended up in the hands of someone who applied a formula to it in order to squeeze out ""successful movie"" type profits. It's really too bad. The premise and the main theme weren't terrible. What they turned those two concepts into is a blatant attempt to cash in on a sellable idea.

As her brain rapidly begins to use its full capacity, Lucy seeks out a professor known for his studies of evolution (Morgan Freeman) in the hopes that he can help her.

In my opinion, this movie could have been better. It has an interesting premise, but the ending is just terrible. ""I am everywhere."" Oooo. I found that to be stupid, and I was disappointed because I sat through the whole thing, only to be let down. There was absolutely NO closure.

However, the plot turned out to be rather derivative, and went off in a strange (and not altogether satisfying) direction. The visuals were great, and ScarJo is hot, as always. Also a big fan of Morgan Freeman, although his role was limited to an extremely supporting one. Overall, if you're fans of the actors, and are up for a sci-fi themed journey down philosophy lane that you've probably already been down before, it's worth a few bucks and an hour and a half of your time.",1425168000,,539,4.625
6551775,2,B00M25EALG,"So, my mom and I started watching this.  I was shocked she even watched it.  She didn't want to finish it though.  I watched the rest the next day.

This movie had an interesting idea.  The problem is, it just had to many ideas and not enough time to give any of them a chance.

So, there is a girl.  She gets drugs put in her.  Things go wrong, and the drugs go into her system.  The thing is, odd things start to happen.  She begins going through a transition.  You see though out the movie that she is using more of her mind.  They show you %s.

Now, as I said, this is an interesting thing.  But the movie was not really very good at all.  Here are the reasons why.

The lady who plays Lucy, the way her character is, kind of makes her look like she is having a seizure.  She just stands there with her eyes looking back and forth and says nothing.  Then, when she does talk, my God, it is the most robotic, mindless, pointless stuff Ive heard.  As good of an actress as she may be, there is nothing she could have done to make this any better.  That really is the way the entire movie goes.  Flatter than a piece of paper that has been rolled over with a diesel truck.

Then, you never learn anything about this girl.  Why was anyone who watches the movie supposed to care at all about her?  It honestly made me feel like I had missed the first half of the movie.

Another thing, 89 minutes, really?  It seems like this movie would have needed hours to get into the deep scientific stuff they were tying to pump into your mind.  It just did not work at all.

After about 40 minutes, this movie became much more of a comedy to me than anything else.  It was just so stupid.  This seems like a rental.  I can see no reason to every buy this movie or watch it again.  It was just stupid.

I think this entire movie can be summed up into this.  What would you do, if you had all the information in the world and only 24 hours to live?  Mind you, they try to do all of that in less than 90 minutes.",1425168000,,1998,4.023017902813299

But unfortunately, unlike ""Spock's Brain,"" there was no doctor to return Lucy to her beautiful body. The special effects were wonderful, and every scene with Scarlett Johansson was magnetic and fun to watch. However, as easily as I suspended disbelief to go along with the transcendental premise, I had trouble understanding the motivation of the Paris police officer. There could have been a smidgen more character development there, and not rushed into a valorous gunfight scene so quickly. The distance from the red writing implement on his desk to dodging a fusillade of lead to protect Lucy stretched credulity. The beauty of sci-fi is not to explain the impossible ""fi"" of the ""sci"" but to explore how it would alter the human experience. If the wonderful imagined were real, how would the friendships, loyalties, or loves of the characters make use of them? The ""fi"" at the ""fin"" of this movie left me wanting a redux, to see how unlimited consciousness made Lucy more human, not less. And why just drop the violent thugs to the floor? Why not turn them on each other? This movie held much potential, but ends in black dust. Got it? Me neither.",1425168000,,1263,4.824884792626728

6551837,4,B00M25EALG,"I ""liked"" this movie, but only because I have a crush (who doesn't) on Scarlett Johannsen, and I have a strong interest in the human potential field. Other than that, I was a disappointed with the pedestrian pace of the movie and the generally bland architecture of it. The premise that Lucy achieved her transformation as a result of a drug has already been done (too much), and much better in Bradley Cooper's ""Limitless,"" where the movie was more the drug's effects than Cooper's transformation. In Lucy, the fact the drug was the cause of her change was kind of glossed over in a way that was unsatisfying, and the unstoppable crime lord trying to retrieve the drug from Lucy was mostly laughable and unconvincing in his extreme martial attack that seemed almost superfluous as a separate Chinese Triad movie with subtitles. Special effects were entertaining, but poor Morgan Freeman was sadly underutilized.  Instead of a drug causing Lucy's expansion, how about a mysterious object or monolith a la 2001, or something?  Or some other way she broke through to her amazing abilities?  For her part, Johannsen only had to use about one facial expression to express the depth of her humanity, really wading in the shallow end of the pool emotionally.  So much more could have been done there (again, comparing to Limitless).  That all said, this would be a great movie to watch in a series in this order: 1)  2001: A Space Odyssey, 2)  Phenomenon (Travolta), 3) Lucy, 4) Limitless.

6551849,5,B00M25EALG,"You might be asking yourself right now with well over two thousand reviews on the film 'Lucy' already posted why would anyone bother to post another? Good question, who am I to think I have anything uniquely different to add to the conversation? To be straightforward, the reason why is because I feel the current overall rating of 3 1/2 Stars is far lower than this film deserves and I'm simply doing what little I can to help raise that rating by at least half a star.

Yes the subject matter has been covered before. The influence of films like '2001: Space Odyssey', 'The Matrix', 'The Fountain', 'Tree of Life' as well as the more recent 'Limitless' and 'Transcendence' can be seen interwoven into the storyline, action scenes and scenery of 'Lucy'. However I don't see this as a distraction or negative, but rather a statement of fact. That fact being it's impossible to come up with something that doesn't contain bits and pieces of other movies within the same genre. Similarities are unavoidable and permissible as long as they're used as a springboard on the way to something new. It's not the repetition, but the subtle nuances that make the film.

Eventually, Lucy becomes so powerful and emotionally distant that it is impossible to sympathize with her character development. While not advisable, this in of itself doesn't sink the movie. Rather, the combination of an unsympathetic protagonist, combined with completely flat supporting characters and a tragically undeveloped, cliche antagonist leaves this movie completely un-engaging.

Again, the initial concept and opening monologue by Morgan Freeman is intriguing, but the plot and character development fail to maintain interest throughout the entire film.",1425081600,,679,6.072916666666667

6551972,2,B00M25EALG,"There was nothing in this movie that stood out in any positive way. Even the core concept for the movie (that we use only 10% of our brains theoretical potential or capacity) is crippled by the fact that we have no way of knowing or measuring exactly how much of our brain's capacity we actually utilize, and what if anything would happen if we were able to use more of our brain. Some of the acting was OK, but the special effects were all rather mundane. There was even a scene which will give Matrix fans a little deja vu. The writer/director Luc Besson, added (what I'm sure he thought was a novel way to show us what the character was feeling) video inserts in the beginning of the film to supposedly enhance the scenes, but it ends up being irritating and insulting instead. When Lucy is feeling like helpless prey to an advancing group of menacing men, the film cuts to an advancing flank of cheetas, etc. Too many scenes are ""illustrated"" in this manner. Even Morgan Freeman's scientific lecture is riddled with ""illustrative"" video clips. Luc Besson also tied in ""the first woman"" Lucy, in an attempt to make it seem that ""destiny"" had come full circle.",1425081600,2,1162,4.564593301435407
6551973,4,B00M25EALG,"This was a mainstream movie that had moderate success in the theatres and it is slick and well packaged.  It is fast paced and the 90 minute length goes by quickly - in a way that is perhaps the negative part of the movie - it should have been a bit longer to develop some of the characters and provide more background.  However, if you want an action packed movie with Scarlett J in it, this is a good choice.  The other characters are all secondary to her character and none of them really are developed to any degree.  The idea is that a young girl gets turned into a drug mule but she gets exposed to the drug she is carrying and evolves to a new level of human.  The science is pretty questionable but it an interesting concept.  So for an action movie with a bit of a sci-fi plot, it is not bad.",1425081600,,801,4.102564102564102

All humans DNA will be switched back on allowing them to utilize 100% of their brains.  And we will be like ""Gods"".  Humans will live in peace for 1,000 years.

I'm not sure how either Scarlett Johansson or Morgan Freeman read this script and said ""Yes, this is going to be a great film"". Several film gimmicks are used and quickly abandoned as the director becomes bored with one idea and switches to another.

Basically a party girl ODs on Heisenberg's blue meth and has an evolutionary leap in brain usage (bad science, here), and alternately shoots (bad) people, drives recklessly, while looking for more drugs to drive her brain function to 100%. Morgan Freeman basically say stuff in his soothing, paternal voice, but looks confused most of the movie.

I call BS on that, but it appeals directly to the blow-them-up teenage small mind. Way too many holes in this ""Small"" part. Second part is how the drug itself affects Scarlett's mind and body. This is the more appealing ""Big"" part of the plot which tries to take a ""big picture"" of how our brains work and what one can (supposedly) do with an enhanced brain that eventually sees to the beginning of time and of us. This part could have used a great deal more exposition as it was much more interesting than the Chinese bad guys plot setter uppers. Movie is short, but surprisingly big on Big Ideas that were not fully developed, realized or understood. And that is part of its downside. Kudos to Scarlett for decent acting and for exposition of ""Big Brain Ideas"", but she did not go far enough to make it really intellectually entertaining. And a Brain Movie without sufficient answers to those questions and provocations it posted is like eating one potato chip - you always want more. Chinese characters and beyond silly acting/plot = ""D"" grade.

6552097,3,B00M25EALG,"What two things do this movie and ""Under the Skin"" have in common?  Scarlett Johansson and black goo.  ""Lucy"" has a better plot at least than ""Under the Skin"".  It's kind of a new twist on the rapid acceleration of human potential through a synthetic version of growth hormone that was only previously found in pregnant women during the gestation period of a fetus.  Lucy is kidnapped, with a ziplock bag of this stuff surgically implanted on top of her intestines, so that she is pressed into service along with others as drug mule, for a brand new drug.  When intercepted on route and kicked repeatedly in the stomach, the bag bursts, and half of its contents are assimilated into her system, rapidly unlocking previously untapped areas of her brain.  Now insofar as the next purported evolutionary stage of humanity from the corporeal to what is essentially a godlike, pervasive, sentient energy, it's been done much better in the Stargate TV series with the Ascension of the Ancients, or even the Q Continuum in Star Trek: the Next Generation.  Going back to witness the birth of the universe, turning into black goo, and then disappearing to become an intangible part of everything: I find this ending to be a bit of a cop out.  Scarlett delivers a fine performance, considering the material she was given to work with but the denouement could have had her reappear as a translucent, human looking spirit being, before becoming ""one with everything"", Buddhist hot dog vendors notwithstanding.  That could have even opened the door for a possible sequel, except that I think the scriptwriters for this movie probably aren't familiar with most SciFi mythos, and somehow thought they were doing something truly innovative.  This plot concept even goes back to the the old B&W Twilight Zone episode with David McCallum, in which he accelerates his evolution but in doing so loses his humanity.  So, basically, if you're going to produce an SF/Action movie, first research what's already been done.  That way you can add something unique and of lasting value to the genre, as the Wachowski Brothers did in 1999 with the original Matrix film, to the old ""brain in a vat"" premise.",1424736000,2,2178,4.872628726287263

This movie was very entertaining, it was sometimes overacted in some places, but it didn't kill the mood, the special effects were done tastefully, so that was also a good thing, so my wife and I both really enjoyed it. Really, Scarlett did about the same acting she did in, ""Under the Skin"", which I really enjoyed, but she overacted in that also, she did the 'head cocking alien' that Jeff Bridges made more believable in, ""Starman"" years ago.
Anyway, I loved it still, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, there was LOTS of blood, but it was not the realistic look, at least to me, so it wasn't gross, like it can sometimes be portrayed in certain movies.

6552150,4,B00M25EALG,"I wouldn't call this a science fiction flick - it is mostly an action film with a pseudo-scientific overlay. It is a pretty good action piece, and I like Johansson in this kind of role.

It has flavors of The Matrix, 2001, the Bourne films, and various other films (think Hulk, The Flash, Spiderman, a certain Outer Limits episode with David McCallum, Phenomena, etc.) blended together in a nice collage, with the usual theme of the underdog getting the best in the end kind of theme. There are some stunning visuals, and interesting fight scenes.

It was hard to keep from laughing during the ridiculous attempts at sounding scientific - considering that the whole central theme is based on the ""Ten Percent Brain Myth,"" a well-known piece of non-scientific blather. It is more of a fantasy action movie than science fiction. Along with that theme is nested the materialist/transhumanist dogma of consciousness arising from ""pure"" intelligence based on some parameter of brain performance. The usual theme of emotion dropping away as one becomes intelligent enough to ""control"" that ""lower"" form of behavior is also key here, as is the idea that one certain form of intellectual approach to things being more ""evolved"" than everything else, and leading to god-like powers.

Who among us has not wished for the kind of power she demonstrates as her ""brain percentage"" grows? It is a fun romp if you suspend strict adherence to science (or even rational thought, for that matter). Think of it as a kind of modern violent fairly tale, and you'll enjoy it. But be on guard for the transhumanist propaganda laid on thick throughout the entire movie.

The only thing that kept me from rolling on the floor over the ""science"" was Morgan Freeman - he could read a phone book and make it sound good.

Worth watching - it is fun.",1424649600,18,1820,4.82051282051282

A bit suckish opening scene - when you know something bad is going to happen, and then indeed it does. However, after first ten minutes or so movie pick ups tempo.

Indeed, the lecture on brain and its potential is of a puh-lease kind, - either you give the viewer credit for some knowledge and sneak the rest in, or you make a scicomentary. That was somewhat silly and, besides, addition of the professor and, later, his colleagues does not actually bring that much to the plot or movie - except kind of silly ""scientific affirmation and awe"" feeling. Unnecessary.

My advice if you haven't seen it is to just simply check your brain in at the door and just enjoy the ride because that's what I did and I had a blast with it. The science depicted in the film is dodgy at best and any and all sense escapes the film's last few minutes completely but it's completely entertaining throughout and Scarlett Johansson is really good in the title role, kicking all sorts of butt in the film. Also of note here is Choi Min-Sik, the film's villain and a natural successor to Gary Oldman. It's not a perfect film and admittedly more than a little silly but it's at the very least worth a watch.

Lucy is presented with a flawless 1080p picture and a robust, thunderous DTS-HD MA sound mix, which is a very good thing because the movie certainly deserved a Blu-Ray with a better than average presentation. There are only two extras, a brief making of and another featurette that covers the science employed in the film. If you haven't seen the film, avoid the making of because it's spoiler heavy.

So long story short, the Blu-Ray is nothing short of spectacular as far as sound and picture. The featurettes are really nothing to write home about though, so if you're looking for something expansive in terms of behind the scenes stuff, this isn't it.

Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke must also be distressed over the butchered homage that Lucy makes to that grand movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey.

So from then on, all I could do was to try to enjoy the ride which was somewhat pleasant if vacuous. I have absolutely no desire to ever sit through Lucy again which usually not a plus in my reviews. If it were not for the fact that Morgan Freeman is probably the only man other than James Earle Jones than could deliver such babble and come close to being believable, the dialogue would be laughable.

Mostly the movie met expectations and gave me a bit of entertainment.,1424563200,,540,4.152380952380953

6552244,4,B00M25EALG,"I hadn't seen any trailers or read any reviews on this movie...went into it blind, other than the brief description. The lead is Lucy, your average ""bad girl"" nobody. She is forced by a low level drug runner into carrying a mystery case into the suite of a high powered Chinese man. This is where the high intensity action begins....

The action plot is very proceedural. It features all the tricks of cimematography that 'The Matrix', and other movies, popularized. It was refreshing to NOT see Lucy engage in any martial art scenes (no spoilers, watch for yourself). The story line is every bit as predictable as 'Die Hard' or 'The Fifth Element'. It should be noted, this is NOT a ""love conquers all"" movie.

I liked this movie for a few reasons....
-First: It is the ONLY one that made my husband I visibly ""glued"" to the progression, out of 4 movies on a lazy Sunday.
-Second: The thought provoking ""science"" that it eluded to.
-Third: A female lead that, though beautiful, is not excessively provocative and NOT wrapped in a love story.
-Fourth: The acting and script were top notch, at least in regard to what our day compared to.

I really like the question of ""what is evolution capable of""? Not humans specifically, as we are only a step in evolution, and a small one thus far. But, what would occur should a life form begin to access greater use of the potential of its brain. The presentation is gripping, the graphics are beautiful, the stoytellers are adept at their job.

We were hooked to the end and discussed the process afterward. A success for any storyteller.",1424563200,,1580,4.632142857142857

Lucy is the type of movie that you tend to either love the way it is filmed with its symbolism intertwined with action and special effects or you tend to not like it.  The action and special effects in this movie are great but the story is a bit lacking along with the way the character is presented in a monotone, lack of emotion kind of way.  As purely an action movie, this has it all with its frenetic pace, over the top action and crazy car chases, with great special effects but it tries to be something more than it really is and the story and dialogue leave something to be desired.  I didn't hate this movie but at the same time felt a bit shortchanged as well.

6552313,5,B00M25EALG,"5.0 out of 5 stars I Love ""LUCY"", the EPITOME of a perfect 5 Stars!

It takes a certain, basic combined amount of intelligence, knowledge in science and even more helpful if acquainted with theology, biology, chemistry, thermal dynamics, quantum theory, molecular and nuclear physics, space time continuum and a vivid yet realistic imagination (or actual mind expansion experience) and the ability to see outside the box to really appreciate and understand this movie. As I told my wife after watching it, ""I'd bet the critics would give it a 6.7 star review (out of 10) just out of knowing how ignorant, simple minded and back woods most people can be. I was within close proximity according to IMB and Amazon reviews. I went to Amazon online, hoping I'd restore my hope in mankind and see an average of at least 4 1/2 stars, but no cigar! (however, since the Redbox CD release, the 5 star reviews are gaining momentum)

Without exaggeration or bias, LUCY is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life! I was so engrossed into this film (story/script), even toward the end, before Lucy said """"I AM EVERYWHERE."" (reaching 100% capacity) I spoke out toward my wife and said: ""SHE'S EVERYWHERE!"".

The concept of having full use of the brains full capabilities (no obstructions or distractions or preconceived notions of knowledge over good and evil, but being perfectly focused), prophetically, philosophically, scientifically, psychologically and theoretically describes and depicts what could actually happen when 100% of the brain can be accessed and a glimpse of what it could be like as once being created perfect in the [image] of God. Did the bible first illustrate this but in more simplistic terms? How did a perfect Jesus (aka Yeshua) have power, mind over matter, to walk on water, raise the dead, heal the blind, materialize or re-appear after death as first perceived unrecognizable (physical transformation) as a gardener and enter an eternal afterlife where death does not exist?

""With as much faith as small as a mustard seed (all doubt removed), you could say to this mountain, be cast into the sea and it would obey you"" (think sub-atomic particles, photons, molecular /electromagnetism and a bit of psychokinetic/telekinetic abilities) not so much the entire mountain as a solid object.

You are what you think! and All things are possible within an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent and benevolent God, where if we could access the full potential of our mind through enhancement of the spirit, which we can hardly perceive (as evidenced by poor reviews), how much more is the mind of God? (rhetorical).

This movie is the EPITOME of a perfect 5 Stars! The Creators are Pure Genius!
Warning, not for the secular or simple minded or those who remain ignorant and unable to perceive, even with a little help, the potential of the human mind, or a greater potential for knowing the mind of God for that matter. If you meet the above criteria of ignorance, for you? if you understood even half this movie, your brain could explode!",1424476800,,3053,4.941520467836257

So I went into watching this pretty much knowing what was going to happen, I heeded the spoiler warnings but still read on. To sum up my review, I thought Scarlett was good but the movie jumped around quite a bit. Some of the effects were neat. I'm not an expert on evolution and all the technical, scientific stuff they were talking about at times so some stuff was just a little past my knowledge and that's where I think the movie can lose a lot of people.

6552389,3,B00M25EALG,"This movie has an interesting concept like Transcendence, but it's all flash and belongs in the trash. There is no actual scientific basis to it, so I don't even think that it should be called science fiction. It's just plain fiction. First off it calls on what used to be an axiom that humans can only access 10% of their brains. Since it has been dis-proven so many times and so long ago, it angers me that they still cite it as fact.

The general population of humanity is dumb enough already and so many rely on pop trivia like repeated movie ""science"" for knowledge. Filmmakers like Luc Besson (who I enjoy and respect usually) who propagate this *expletive deleted* need to either take basic science classes, or they need to have their script writers/underlings do some basic research on the subject matter and provide a bit of knowledge on the subject. At least enough to catch blatant errors like this. I would assume that it's possible for directors to know that there's an error, but keep it ecause it's integral for the plot and rely on the ignorance of the audience, which to me is a horrible crime.

Just to correct the old axiom, we humans can access 100% of our brains. I believe what they are referring to is that we can only access a certain amount of the data we have stored. We can only access a small percentage of it at a time. I will try to put it into the movie's language - it would be like this:

<spoilers ahead>

10% - You're accessing normal amounts of data. You get tricked into being a drug mule for an experimental, very rare, very potent, super expensive drug Which like in the movie ""Limitless"" makes the user a temporary Brainiac.

20% - The guys using you as a mule for this super duper expesive, important drug leave you in the hands of super morons who try to rape you/beat you, causing all the pouches of implanted drugs to burst and enter your system. In real life you gain a 20% increase of brain access. You are blessed with ADD, and an inability to concentrate. You need an extra 2,500 calories a day as you're going into ketoacidosis from cannibalizing fat and muscle to make enough energy for your brain. You're drinkng 6 liters of the sugariest soda and eating lots of candy bars. You're constantly sweating and you're running a constant temp of 99f.

For some reason you're upping the amount of the drug. You're at 30% brain speed access. You have occasional seizures. You need 5,000 extra calories daily and your brain's temp is running about 103f causing you to put it in cold water that needs constant replacement. You're constantly drinking soda and eating frosting from the cans. Your heart is dong double duty trying to oxygenate your brain. Why are you contnuing this? Oh yeah, cool movie idea.

Now you're at 40% access - you need to ingest 10-20,000 calories per day, you're skin and bones from cannibalizing all your muscle and fat. Your hair's falling out, but hopefully you'll be able to think some up at will when you're at 100%. Ooh, what's that, a squirrel? You have constant blackouts because your body can't make enough energy/provide enough oxygen and control the heat. Your brain runs at about 110f. Your brain begins to overheat and you need to put your head into an ice bath to avoid going into a coma.

50% - You're a vegetable from the constant seizures... You could control your body's systems if you could focus on any one thing for more than a nanosecond - your autonomic systems are failing and your body cannot make itself function, everything is shutting down, you need to be on a heart/lung machine to saturate your blood with enough oxygen and sugar to keep your brain running, not too mention that your blood needs to be cooled to 20f before it is returned to your body because your brain is constantly running over 120f. You're also on dialysis because your kidneys and pancreas are shutting down from diabetes because you need to mainline 50,000 calories of pure glucose to keep up with your energy demands...

60% - Yeah, you're *expletive deleted* Why did you take all those drugs? If you were in the Matrix, you'd be an excellent coppertop.

The movie could be interesting and fun as long as science doesn't get in the way. But zero science... This is 100% fiction. Add Morgan Freeman to give it a voice of authority and you have 75% of the *expletive deleted* that passes for sci-fi nowadays. We really needs another genre because sci-fi is so bastardized. It's just fantasy with pretend science... Pseudo-Sci-Fi maybe? Who knows. This was a cheap thrill fun, but crap for sci-fi. I had high hopes but was so dissapointed...

6552390,1,B00M25EALG,"The was bad for a B rate movie, really quite bad.  Here is some of the reasons
1- There really is no plot drug running.  You don't know where the drug comes from, where it is going to, what they think it does.  So there is no finding the plot of who is controlling this and stopping the product.
2- There really is no plot scifi.  She gets hit with a drug and starts being able to manipulate matter and energy.  We knew that going in and that is all we know going out.  She alerts the scientists studying this and gives knowledge, what knowledge? We don't know, just a thumb drive, ha.
3- At first you get the nature flashes that are just distracting, at one point funny (not funny, ha, ha, but LOL stupid.  Immortality or Procreation? Well let's look at the animals screwing. Tigers, frogs, hippos, etc.. like 10)
4- Then we get the psychedelic flashes, you know the Dr Who time tunnel type,  but you don't get to understand what is happening, left to the immagination.
5- Finally, you get her time traveling in her chair, to what point, because the beginning of the universe doesn't fit on a thumb drive.
6- So if we go back to the plot.  She kills a lot of the people (hired guns), and wrecks into a lot of innocent bystanders, yet she leaves the top bad guys living to wreak havoc again?  and the English guy that seems to be running it, you don't see him again.  Guess he gets away with it all.

6552408,3,B00M25EALG,"This movie wasn't really what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman in this, but for the premise of Lucy obtaining all these powers while unlocking parts of her brain, I was hoping to see more...well, action! The argument is made that she becomes less human as she gains her powers, but it seems like a weak excuse for there to be no reaction from her as her powers are developing. I also think the movie is trying to be more deep and meaningful at the end than it's extravagant premise would allow for. It just didn't feel right or satisfying at the end of it all. Also, the ending wasn't really explained well and it felt like you needed a background in astrophysics or something to understand or appreciate it.

Had to be sold as an action film because everyone knows New Age films are pretty boring. Big middle finger to Michelangelo (and every Christian ever) when Lucy reaches out to touch 'Lucy.'
This is not another Limitless. In Limitless, the main character solves his entire future on day one. The hook is that the audience doesn't realize it until the end (Why the book is titled that way.)
In contrast Lucy goes from young-ish/ innocent-ish (doesn't question the cowboy hat guy/ doesn't realize shes dressed like a prostitute) to super-human/ brain. She then proceeds to kill people for more power. It's okay because she possibly helps humanity in the end with a thumb drive. And the people she killed were bad people anyways. Most likely. One for sure was.
Bugs me:
-Human female has complete and total control of her own body.
-SAME human female desperately needs a hormone -ONLY MANUFACTURED- by human females to achieve her goal.
-Solution: Human female murders as many people as possible, in two or three countries, to attain enough of this hormone to become a god.

6552437,5,B00M25EALG,"I avoided this movie for months due to the ratings.  I usually won't watch anything under 4 stars.  This evening I finally gave in after a year or two.  I love Scarlett Johansson and I was excited to hear of the film when it first came out.  But I skipped it due to weird reviews.  After finally watching it...

The movie LUCY is GREAT and after watching it-it does not match the lower star reviews.  Then it occurred to me, Lucy kicks the crap out of a bunch of men and so I looked at the gender of who one starred it and 90% seem to be men. HA HA HA HA I bet if I looked at gender of two star same thing.  This is the first movie that taught me ratings or ""stars"" can sometimes mean ZIP.  It can also mean a competitive movie that came out the same time-had a lot of people in here rating this one down.

The movie is not really sci-fi until maybe the end. It is action packed and filmed in really great cities-not your hum drum NYC or typical Hollywood stuff.  It very definitely has a plot and a great ending.  Much of the script is true to life and how drug mules are used in the international transport scheme of things.

  Otherwise, the movie felt as if it had been hastily put together as soon as the producers learned that they had the rights to the script and a contract with Scarlett Johansson to play the lead. Even so, it was fun to see a professor's dazzling predictions about what the human mind could do at full capacity actually ""come true"" on screen.

6552547,5,B00M25EALG,"This movie is a great movie, BUT it is not easy to follow and understand, unless you have some previous knowledge about what it is actually about.

If you are expecting to see a movie with a superhero, with super power from another planet, or any Marvel styles movies, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOU. Also, if you created an expectation or a pre-judgment based on the trailer. This is NOT a movie for you either.

This movie has a lot of metaphor, and scientific theories embedded in the story, which causes a lot of misunderstanding if you are no familiar with scientific theories, epistemology, foundationalism, and other basic concepts of reasoning.

Even if you do not have any background knowledge, it is very likely you will still understand the movie, if you do not bring any judgment over the movie itself, but try to gasp what are they really telling you, in other words, try to see beyond the action.

It is definitely an intellectual movie with great visual effects and great story.",1424390400,,990,4.64

I think the production company MUST pay the person who made the trailer tons of money. He/She did a wonderful job deceiving so many people into watching this pure garbage.
I wouldn't even call this movie one of the worst movies ever. This IS ""THE WORST"" movie ever.

Yeah, sure, it's a movie....not reality...I know that. I didn't expect it to be a reality movie at all.
On the contrary, I actually thought this movie was one of those Marvel comic movie...you know...the super hero stuff. I was really looking forward to seeing it and happy to find out that it finally came out in DVD.

It looked interesting enough in the beginning but it got weird fast. Sometimes, I even felt like I was actually watching a documentary about animal kingdom or something. Also all the evolution and big bang stuff.... I could definitely see some propaganda going on and was not too comfortable with it BUT I felt better about that after watching the ending. I applaud them for doing the damage to themselves. Wow...I couldn't believe the ending. I can't believe the actors even agreed to that ending. I really hope they didn't know the ending before they started doing this movie or even before they agreed to doing this movie cause otherwise, it would make them look so dumb or desperate for money.

I sure am glad I got this movie for free with a promo code. I would have hated to waste my hard earned money on this garbage on top of my precious time. Now I have to return it tomorrow. It sucks that I would have to drive out to return it but I'll be glad to get this s*** out of my house.

I'm sure I would get tons of ""unhelpful"" votes cause I see all the 1 star reviews here got lots of down votes for some reasons even though they were all telling the truth.",1424304000,,1881,4.39367816091954
6552856,4,B00M25EALG,Not bad but Scarlett acted to much like a robot as the drug were taking over.  I know she was changing but the continual turning of her head from left to right and her spacey looks became a little annoying. The action was great but some scenes didn't fall into place.

It's generally an action movie but delves into the idea of ""singularity"", in which a conscious being has power beyond comprehension.  Most disparaging remarks I've noticed deal with how far this goes or how ""inhuman"" the main character seems.  I'd argue: That is exactly the point.

6552861,5,B00M25EALG,"Now that my TVs are High Definition I rarely buy DVDs. Whenever there is a DVD I want to see Ill either rent it or wait until its on Cable. After watching Lucy I had to buy it. This is not the typical Luc Besson Action Film; this film has an interesting message also. Throughout the movie there are references to cells, cells as the building block of matter, individuals as a cell, family units as a cell, the human species as a cell and this Gaia-Sphere we inhabit as a cell. Our modern Industrial society also has characteristics of a cell, a Metastasizing Carcinoma. The movie talks about time giving legitimacy to existence, Ive always wondered, if time is infinite, the fact that we exist no matter what the probability of it happening, then weve had this dance many times in the past and will have this dance again in the future, this might be why Lucy says we never really die. The central theme of the movie is what happens as Lucy gains more control of her Cerebrum capacity, this is a common Sci-Fi theme. Considering the energy required to have our Brain function at 10% its hard to imagine well ever be able to control more than this, 25% of our basal metabolism goes to the Brain. The question we need to be asking is, does our high Carbohydrate, high Sugar and low Fat Western diets provide enough energy for our Brains to function properly. The foods we eat seem to promote Fat storage not metabolism, is it possible the majority of people in the West have Brains that are undernourished. Maybe a population whos thinking and reasoning abilities are diminished is desirable, maybe this type of population is easy to manipulate and control.  Lucy tells a group of scientists that we have codified our existence to bring it down to human size to make it comprehensible; weve created a scale for it so that we can forget its unfathomable scale. The Deities weve created to define what we are, the Abstractions we possess that give our life value; as a species weve become more concerned with having than being. Over the last Billion years conditions have existed that has allowed this Gaia-Sphere to nurture a wide range of varied, beautiful and interconnected expressions of life, humans are just one of these expressions. Lucy says it best What are we going to do with this Gift.",1424304000,,2293,4.606356968215159

6552863,4,B00M25EALG,"I am usually the first person to give movies like ""Lucy,"" a one star, but not this time.  Why?  The movie ""Lucy"" is a rather multi-layered and visually creative film.  It has very good parts and rather bad parts to it.  The good parts...are the photography and special effects which are very well done and even remind me a lot of ""The Fifth Element"" movie.  Why?  Maybe because it was written and directed by the same man...Luc Besson.  The Fifth Element"" was another fantastically creative film, also with a uneven storyline.  Lu Besson did not seem to know if he wanted to make a mob movie, or a Transcendence movie...so what resulted were two distinct movies...which he did a good job of patching together.  Now if Lu Besson would stop writing and directing his own films and only produce them...I think he would have a winner.  Johansson is unbelievably good in the movie most of the time, no matter what the reviews say.  What I absolutely hated was the ""generic"" ending.  The, ""I am everywhere"" speech which is always how these films are written to end and I think it is a lazy writer's ""cop out.""

6552888,2,B00M25EALG,"Listen, I wasn't expecting this movie to be a masterpiece. I hate to say it, but Scarlett Johansson isn't exactly the best actress out there, and I guess their way of dealing with that was to have her tilt her head and talk in a monotonous, robotic fashion, the entire movie. I'm also getting the sense that Morgan Freeman is now signing on to projects without reading them, first, just so he can pass the time. Too bad. I put the movie on as something to run in the background to mildly amuse me, and it barely accomplished that. Honestly, it felt like more of a task, by the time it was finished.

It was artistically interesting from a visual perspective. I'll give them that much, hence the 2nd star. The ""acting"" was absolutely terrible (what did I expect?). I suspected the movie would be sub-par, right off the bat, with the strange way it started off, and the flashing images of gazelles scared of being eaten (We get it, you were trying to clue us in on the fact that Lucy was like the prey. No National Geographic footage required.). The ""story"" lacked any depth. It could have at least made up for that a little, with some action/excitement, but there were no real action scenes, to speak of. At least not the type a viewer usually wants to see, with a well-balanced fight and some real grittiness and suspense. It was really just about a trashy woman who turns into an invincible woman, who then easily destroys anyone who tries to stop her from getting from point A to B, with the swipe of a hand and some telekinesis. The story was silly and not at all interesting, or well thought out. There was not a single surprise or twist or ""A-HA"" moment.",1424217600,,1659,4.439344262295082

I had an extremely hard time suspending my disbelief around the total stupidity of the ""we only use 10% of our brain"" idiocy. This was a lazy cop out that in 2014 is not excusable. There are so many other ways to talk about the enhancement of Lucy's brain due to the drug that would not need that crutch. Limitless is a good example. There is, I think, one sentence in the movie and not by a scientist referencing the 10% myth. The crazy increased brain function is never fully explained but it is heavily implied that the drug enhances, speeds up and allows the neurons in the brain to send messages in different ways plus some kind of enhanced chemical effect, causing the brain to secrete chemicals in heaver levels. But no... I am being lectured by Morgan Freeman in the first act of the movie about how we only use 10% of our brain. I didn't think I would make it through the first act due to this major scientific error. And I am not that scientifically literate. Thankfully I was able to move beyond this and was entertained by the film. In the third act questions about existence and life are hinted at but not really explored.

6552995,4,B00M25EALG,"It's not the movie I expected based on the trailers and it being a Luc Besson-associated effort. It deliver son the action, it has a great story and that quirky feel Besson movies have. But this is a much more philosohoical effort than others he has had attached to his name. The action happens around the story, it never seems to divethe story. The story is intriguing and asks some very interesting questions about self and what it means to be human. It's an enjoyable ride, but I couldn't help feeling more engaged and thoughtful than satiated at the end.

And...I'm sorry, at one point was ScarJo God, because it looked a lot like when she touched fingers with prehistoric man that was a very pointed reference to Michelangelo's Hand of God from the freakin SISTINE CHAPEL. Scarlett Johanson is God now? She travelled back in time and made Adam? What? And now she's merged with God and manifests her God powers in text messages and extra-long and shiny black phallic memory sticks? I'll make this a short rant. Runner-up for most ridiculous part of this movie: In the dumb shoot-out at the end, the statue which looks like a muppet is blown to bits. Who is this statue? No clue. Relevance? Dunno. Just a muppet statue blown to bits to glorious music. Most ridiculous part of the movie: This blue stuff- the supposed atom bomb stem cell juice whatever. It looked like a specialty construction material. It did not look like drugs and since clearly it was not any known drug they wouldn't have to hide it. You have to hide heroin cause the cops are looking for it. You do not have to hide shiny blue ball bearings. No one's looking for that. No one even knew what it was. You can probably fill a caulking gun with those babies and ship them via Fedex. You could fill out a commercial invoice and put them in the mail. WTF? You don't have to abduct highly visible exchange students from First World countries that would DEFINITELY be reported missing by their clearly devoted friends and family and insert what can easily pass for a harmless substance and insert it into their bodies! That is the worst idea anyone ever had. Ever. Scarlett makes some really bad movies.

The way that 2001 - A Space Odyssey took you to the edge of science and threw you into a cauldron of more questions this movie does the same to you. If you hate that kind of movie then please look elsewhere.  If you are the kind of person who loves that there are questions to ask then you can forgive some of the shortcuts the movie takes to get you there. These kind of movies can either try to drown you in dialogue or hit you with the ideas and move on and this one doesn't drown you in explanations and keeps on moving. Movies are about suspension of disbelief and science fiction movies that go past technology into the big questions of the universe sometimes take you to where you need to suspend your disbelief and that's what this movie does. Sure there is action and there is Scarlett Johansson and car crashes and guns shooting and cgi and technology but that is all here to service the big question - what is the meaning of life?

After saying that, I have to admit it would not be as good a movie without Scarlett Johansson. She has developed into one of the better actresses of this era; and has the versatility to play any role well...especially the action heroine role she plays in this film. She also has developed a fine deadpan comic delivery, exemplified by the opening quote...in the scene, she has just immobilized the chief villain, Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) with two knives through his hands, when she deadpans the quote. Drug Lord, Mr Jang, forced her to become a drug mule for a powerful new synthetic drug. Surgically implanted in her colon, it is released when she is kicked in the stomach by one of her captors. Lucy undergoes unimaginable changes that gradually unlock her mind's full potential. She receives help from Professor Norman (played by the ubiquitous, Morgan Freeman) the leading authority on the human mind; and police captain, Pierre del Rio (Amr Waked). Lucy turns into a merciless warrior, intent on revenge against her captors and a compassionate scholar, intent on sharing the vast knowledge and wisdom the new drug has opened to her. In addition to Besson's direction, look for some breathtaking CGI special effects and cinematography of the first order. Make your own judgement, but for me this is one of the best movies of 2014!",1423699200,,1553,4.908745247148289

Other than the caveat that is asked of the viewer that we as human beings use 10% of our brain functionality (which we know to be untrue). The movie asks and then answers within its action genre format and parameters the question of what and who we are and what we can hope to achieve.

Is this 2001: A Space Odyssey? No. Is this Close Encounter of the Third Kind? Nope. This is an action movie through and through. This is pulp fiction. This is the kind of movie where you must suspend disbelief to enjoy. However, you will find that if you do, you will see some actual thought on display.

Questions want to be answered and they are. In fact, the story does follow logic. I was thinking to myself as I saw the movie. ""I would do what she is doing right now if I were in the same situation and I had the same abilities"".

6553084,3,B00M25EALG,"Interesting concept, but expected it to have more energy and power. I was watching the scenes thinking that something amazing would occur, but, most of the time the movie fell flat, for me. It seemed that the first 1/3rd was better than the last 2/3rds of the movie. The climax came early on, when she reacted to the drug and you began to watch her eerie transformation. The use of foreshadowing was a miss; 1%, 10%, 20%, 40%, all the way up to 100%. As she increased her brain power, I expected more amazing feats, but received less on screen.

Imagine if she could fly, appear and disappear, levitate, translocate, grow limbs, have beyond super human strength, (die and come back to life, and show us the journey), be able to breath and habituate underwater, go to heaven or even hell, or visit another universe; meet aliens, meet God (or Satan and his demons), or the like. She did go back in time briefly, but even that experience was a flat depiction of what it could have been on screen. Hollywood had the technology to wow us, but, they didn't. It was not a bad way to spend an hour and thirty minutes (incidentally, it should have been longer, too), it was just okay. Also, for the price, Amazon should make viewing available for at least 24 hours, rather than allow just a single, one-time viewing of the movie.",1423612800,2,1320,4.523012552301255

Now, although we have seen how the brain CAN be used to consciously control heartbeat, breath, and other normally automatic functions. And in studies of what used to be called ""hysterics"" how the brain can cause ""stigmata"" (the marks of Jesus' Crucifixion) to appear in the devout as well as so-called hysterical blindness, paralysis, and so on---all of which are examples of ""mind over matter""---one cannot say that one would end up with the amazing abilities Lucy demonstrates in this movie.

In real life, most people get too much drug on their system actually died; very few survive 2/100 (& its a miracle). We know so many celebrities died because of high dosage intake of prescription drug and other illegal drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, etc. The only thing that I would believe is when the drugs got inside her system, she imagine things (hallucination). But its impossible she become super human way beyond because of these new invented drugs. I believe there are few normal people in this world could create some unexplainable circumstances by dreaming and using their imagination and compare the alignment of planet and stars without taking illegal drugs (like for example those former Astronomist from our old history) that predict events & wrote them down for us to read (& after several years it happened).

6553128,3,B00M25EALG,"The concept of the movie is one I think about a lot; the whole notion of time as unity and our lack of understanding it due to our limited perception. So that's interesting.

But the execution of the movie leaves a lot to be desired. SJ, once she is exposed to the chemical that makes more of her brain accessible to her (and there is no back story as to why that drug was created or what anybody intends to do with it other than feed it experimentally to some kidnapped junkies), begins to walk around with an expression on her face like a child trying to understand some new lesson, and that expression never leaves her face after it first appears.

She then casually walks through heavily guarded areas brandishing weapons in both hands and absentmindedly shooting people (she says ""hey"" and kills four people in one scene); somehow she becomes a brain surgeon and casually shoots a patient that is in her way because ""you couldn't have saved him anyway.""

The end of the movie goes into a pretty absurd chain of scenes where she appears to be manipulating time and space, but with very little direction or reason (e.g. encountering the first prehistoric woman, ""Lucy"", and reaching out like God to touch her finger, and then just vanishing).

All in all, not a TERRIBLE movie, but you do get the sense that although the movie was made about somebody that gets REALLY smart, it misses a lot of smart opportunities, settling instead for an attractive female walking around with a vapid expression through lots of glitzy digital production.

As in the preview Lucy (played by Scarlet Johansson) gets access to 100% of her brain.  There have been so many theories as to what would happen if we could do this.  Strangely enough, part of the reason we only get 14% is because of things that are not connected in our brain rather than the inability to send and receive signals.  So if we could heal parts of us we would know something.  Anyway this film has some of the more popular theories of what will happen along with a few that were not thought up by scientists.

6553134,5,B00M25EALG,"Finally!  A sci-fi film for THINKING people.  No zombies, no vampires, no super-naturual garbage, no Transformers, no Star Trek and ... no freaking Marvel comic book junk!

Solid classical cerebral science fiction, in the same league as 2001: A Space Odyssey.  OMG, the movie actually had some real science! True, if you're an evolutionary biologist, a neurologist, or even just have a good understanding of general chemistry, there were a few things that might cause you to wince. A number of scientific concepts were stretched a bit, but that's what good sci-fi does; it pushes the boundaries of known science and theoretical science without sliding into to the realm of ridiculous fantasy.

Don't be fooled by the somewhat cliche innocent-girl-gets-revenge-against-bad-guys storyline that unfolds in the first 20 minutes; by the time the film ends, you'll have forgotten all that and be totally focused on something WAY deeper!  I won't give spoilers to those who've yet to see this work, but I did NOT see the ending coming, what unfolded was a pleasant surprise.  Ms. Johannson did an excellent job depicting the various stages of Lucy's -- uh -- ""development"" from a ditzy zoned-out blond into something other-worldy.

Yeah, there were quite a few gigantic plot holes but I was having some much fun watching I didn't really notice them all that much until the 2nd & 3rd viewing.  Also could have done with a whole lot less gratuitous violence, the obligatory car chase was kinda cool, though -- reminded me of the ""French Connection"", ""Bullet"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".

As other reviewers have pointed out, the film did make use of certain themes from a number of sci-fi classics ( primarily Dune, 2001 and  Fifth Element),  but does so in a good way; if you spot them, just smile and enjoy the moment.  As far as I can tell, the film's ""punchline""  (given in the final minutes) turned out to be something fairly unique for a sci-fi film.  If  you ever read Arthur C. Clark's classic ""Childhood's End"" (required reading for the true hardcore sci-fi geek) , then you'll enjoy the film ""Lucy"".",1423353600,,2098,4.90084985835694

Professor, why'd you give me an F?
Because there was no lower grade.

I pity the actors who had to go through this. Perhaps their professionalism provides sufficient distance from the context of their performances to protect them from the intellectual sludge that pretends to depth and insight. I pity myself for having paid money and burned a piece of my life to watch this.

There were some nice visual moments. The juxtaposition of the cheetahs and the gangstahs was pretty good and the visuals associated with Morgan Freeman's silly non-scientific science caught some quite spectacular nature photography, including rhino sex.

Scarlett's terror was palpable and the bad guys started out quite convincingly bad but that lasted 15 minutes at most. Perhaps the best part was the disgusting boyfriend trying to get her to deliver the case, but I'm reaching for something nice to say.

Harry Potter has a more plausible premise and better science. ""We only use X percent of our brains. What if we used Y percent?"" Maybe some cognitive guys trying to get a grip on how brains work have given some sense to a measure like that, but it strikes me as more likely it is a measure of our ignorance of brain function rather than a measure of brain function. More fundamentally the idea of percentage of utilization suggests that we have some way to make sense out of what would constitute full utilization.

Geof Hinton, one of the bid dawgs of machine learning, once explained how to visualize a 1000 dimension vector space:
visualize a 3 dimensional space then squint your eyes pretty tight and keep repeating
""It's really 1000 dimensions; it's really 1000 dimensions; ...""
But 1000 dimensional vector spaces are trivial compared to the brain. As are 1,000,000 dimensional spaces (a 1000x1000 still b&w),
Putting a number on brain capacity is meaningless.

Besson suggests that at something like 30% utilization we get a gestural interface to the universe. Wave and pinch and you can separate the cellular spectrum or travel through time. Seriously, we are supposed to imagine that if we really tapped into our deepest selves we'd find the universe worked like an iPhone. Not nearly as cool as Harry's wand.

At 60% you can stick nasty gangstahs on the ceiling. At 100% you become a god than can text message without fingers.

The really scary drugs are the ones that persuaded Besson to stage the Lucy meets Lucy fingertip touch. I wasn't sure whether to gag or chortle.",1423267200,9,2508,4.870892018779343

Lucy (Johansson) is living in Taipei, Taiwan where she is duped into delivering a briefcase to a mysterious man, Mr. Jang, by a man she has been dating for a few days.  He gets blown away and she is dragged off to a room where she is given the code to open the case.  Inside are baggies of little blue crystals, synthetic CPH4.  Next thing you know Lucy wakes up with a seeping bandage on her midsection.  She receives the news that she needs to grab plane tickets and head for a destination where the chemicals inside her can be retrieved, only then can she and a group of other unfortunates in her same situation procure their freedom.  Well, the plan doesn't figure out smoothly and the CPH4 baggie bursts inside her.  Suddenly, things become interesting.  The funny thing about CPH4 is that it gives the gift of increased brain function.  Where humans use 10% of their minds potential, Lucy starts to move towards 100%.  What does that unlock?  Think about total bodily function control.  Telepathy?  So much more.  But the problem with 100% brain function is that your boy will eventually burn out like a dying star from energy consumption.  Time is ticking so she invokes the help of Professor Samuel Norman to aid her in the quest for self-preservation.  Flashy.  Energetic.  Runs like machinegun fire.  Intense.

6553213,4,B00M25EALG,"How can a film be witty, intelligent, and fun yet so, stupid and mundane? Well director acclaimed action writer, producer and director Luc Besson has found a way to bring combine both in Besson's Lucy.

Luc Besson's best years are decades behind him with his last great directorial effort in 1997's The Fifth Element, and his best script effort since probably way back in 2002 with the original Transporter mixed in plenty of mediocre or subpar directorial and writing efforts. Yet Luc Besson is a master at crafting strong independent women who overcome hardships and violence, and continues the trend he started with Anne Parillaud in Nikita, and continues with Scarlett Johansson in Lucy. Though the film Lucy evolves and transforms thanks to a new designer drug that opens a pathway in her brain so that Lucy can assess more than ten percent of her brain that the average human has access that Lucy gains access to parts of her mind she has never been able to use before being able to learn near instantly, having access to all technology, and eventually being able to control time becoming god leading a strange moment where question is Scarlett Johansson god, and yes she is, and Lucy struggles with this realization about human limitation, her loss of her own humanity, and her death, Lucy comes to a decision about herself and perhaps the future of the human race.

Lucy certainly has a lot going on with the plot that Luc Besson wrote, and there were a lot of problems with it that I'll get to in a moment. Besson wrote is script base on the idea and myth that humans only use about ten percent of our brains. It's a myth created some time in the late 19th or early 20th centuries and that I believe growing up and spread through mass media like the most recent film Limitless.

Still Besson's script is still is decently well done as Besson takes it step further than Limitless asking what would happen if we as humans had access to one hundred percent of our brain, and using all of it at the same time not just using a small percent while the rest of the brain rests until it is needed. Besson also has fun with the script mixing humor and imagery to advance an idea or visualize a plot moment even further especially in the early part of the film like animals matting or a Cheetah stalking a Gazelle, but Besson's overly uses these moments as a plot device taking away from the overall plot and action of the film. The screenplay also seemed to have been heavily edited has Luc Besson had said he had written a whole back story for Lucy. Whether it was Besson's ideas or the studio editors the script seems to have been tripped to meet a specific running time of about an hour and twenty five minutes taking away from any real character development outside of Lucy. I think Luc Besson wanted the film to stand on the idea for the script about humans and the access we have to our brains, and the question of what would happen to use as humans we had access to one hundred percent our brains, and could use it all at once, which if true ends up being a detriment to the quality of the film.

With the edited script and director Luc Besson's decision to focus on his overall concept of the film actors like Morgan Freeman playing Professor Norman, Amr Waked as a French police captain Pierre Del Rio, and Choi Min-sik as Kang are short changed with the edits or it could be that the script was so bad that re-drafts, and edits had to be done. The script wasn't the only thing that was hurt by the edited script the action was as well. Lucy certainly does have its intense and fun moments, but they're more to do with showing off Lucy's new found powers like putting to sleep a whole hallway of police officers in a hospital, single handling taking down a hallway full of Hong Kong gang members, watching as her body begins to literally fall to pieces on a plane, and a trippy moment when Lucy meets and early primate that was awesome that leaves the action with a major room for improvement especially two scenes late in the film. One scene takes place in the streets of Paris as Lucy, and Pierre Del Rio are rushing to a hospital to stop some gang members. The scene is obviously edited especially if you go back and watch the trailer, and the scene isn't even a car chase scene it's essentially moving characters from point A to point B just with a few car flips and wrecks. The action scene was poorly conceived, and filmed. Another scene is the climax that has a showdown with the Paris police and the Hong Kong mob inside a university, and again the drawn out scene seems to have been edited for time, poorly conceived and filmed taking away from the drama and suspense of the scene.

The negative seems to outweigh the positive with Lucy except we're forgetting one factor in the talented and gorgeous actress who like in Captain American: Winter Soldier displays her acting talent, and action ability to once again show Scarlett can lead an action film, and deserves solo Black Widow film. Thanks to Johansson's many talents that she has displayed many times this year and throughout her career bring acting ability, charm, personality, electricity, and humanity to Lucy that helps save the film from failure.

Luc Besson was once a true favorite of mine when it came to action able to bring a good script, unique, strong and independent women who were equal or even surpassed their male counter parts, and electrifying heart stopping action sequences, but those days are long behind him, and it may be time for the once influential action director to retire. Thankfully Scarlett Johansson and a few cool script concepts, decent action scenes that make Lucy a fun and decent action film, and save Lucy from being a bad action film filled with a mediocre script, many poorly done action sequences, and bad editing.",1423008000,,5831,4.564469914040115

6553246,2,B00M25EALG,"This movie started out great! It was engaging, intriguing, and believable, and then it went BEYOND absurd. I love the idea of an attractive young woman having full access to her intellect. After a disturbing, illegal-drug-related incident, our blonde heroine ""Lucy"" develops very special powers. There is some excellent acting from Scarlett Johansson, but I lost my faith in the movie when she started ""falling"" up the wall and ceiling after her accidental exposure to the illegal drug. (I wondered if this was supposed to be perceived falling, like what it might feel like when a person is high from drugs. But I think she was literally supposed to be lifted into the air after her drug exposure. Dumb!) Lucy gains the ability to recall memories of her childhood and infancy, and she can block her own physical pain. (She pulls a fresh bullet out of her arm without so much as wincing.) I struggled with the concept of being able to suspend people in the air and to turn on televisions and radios using telekinesis...If you can suspend your disbelief enough for big ideas like these, you might really enjoy the movie.
  I thought the music was FABULOUS, and I particularly enjoyed the track paired with the crazy car chase! Other than that, it was too far out for me to really enjoy.",1422921600,,1284,4.727678571428571

6553248,3,B00M25EALG,Entertaining movie but the whole premise about using only 10% of our brains was disproven so long ago it made very hard for suspension of disbelief and accept the premise of the movie.  If they would have just left the whole 10% thing out and just left it as a drug that changed the way the brain works by allowing some type of quantum computing the whole thing would have been much more believable.  Still enjoyable ride.  Just much less so when they keep going back to a false premise as the foundation for the whole movie.,1422921600,,525,4.391752577319588
6553249,2,B00M25EALG,"Lucy tells the hypothetical story of what would happen if a person could access more than 10% of their cerebral capacity. Throw in some cool special effects and spice it up with beautiful Scarlett Johnasson and you have this movie. Please note may contain some spoilers (although the real spoiler would be watching this movie again...).
The opening scene places you in Taipei (Taiwan) with a scene where Lucy is partying. The next point her boyfriend is trying to convince her to deliver a mysterious briefcase. At this point we learn that the case contains a blue powdery substance - a drug. The plan is to have Lucy become a mule and transport the substance back to Europe. However, during the night the bag leaks and the drugs intereact opening her cerebral capacity. While this scene was vital for setting up the backstory for how Lucy gets her abilitys it was poorly done. It was quick and dirty and just left you thinking ""really?"". The next chapter in this allegory unfolds into Morgan Freeman's character espousing scientific views on cerebral capacity and the fruits it may yeild. This is where things fall apart in more than one way. The normally excellent stability that Morgan Freeman can provide to a movie is not enough to save this ship from sinking. The whole movie shifts from plot and substance to explosions and special effects. The deterioration of plot is also evident in the enourmous body count that is racked up in the later part of the film. At the end you're questioning what you just saw and trying to reconcile if you wasted your time and money. I for one answered quickly - yes on both counts.

Later that evening we tried Lucy and were experiencing the same thing. I wanted to watch the movie so we tried Apple TV's iTunes store for a rental and it streamed flawlessly.

6553269,3,B00M25EALG,"""Lucy"" isn't really a bad movie. It beautifully shot, has some really impressive special effects and the performances, such as they are, seem perfectly acceptable.

What's missing is an actual story. In fact, there's a real sense that the purpose of the film is to allow for a lot of exciting action and in order to do that they realized they'd at least need some kind of story.

The plot, such as it is, revolves around Scarlett Johannson as an American slacker chick, living in Taiwan for some unexplained reason, who gets suckered into becoming a drug mule by her short term boyfriend. When the drugs, sewn into her abdomen to sneak them past customs, begin to leak the chemical, a lab created version of a growth hormone into her bloodstream. The result is she immediately begins to be able to access more than the usual 10% of her brain capacity that all normal human beings are limited to.

From that point on the science fiction is placed in the backseat and the film goes out of its way to find new and unique action sequences to toss at the audience in quick succession.

I have two major problems with the movie.

The first is that it doesn't make much sense. Supposedly cutting edge scientific ideas are tossed out to seemingly justify the goings on but are so illogical and unexplainable that they needn't have been mentioned in the first place. For one thing the whole notion that human beings only utilize 10% of their brain capacity is a little silly. Human beings use their entire brain, though not all of it at once. Some segments control physiological processes, others hold memory, logic and what we call consciousness. Perhaps it can be organized in a more efficient way but it certainly isn't sitting 90% dormant and inactive. That's just stupid.

A glaring, almost laughable moment comes toward the build up to the climactic shoot out in the science lab. The bad guys have congregated literally outside the front door of the building, all grabbing and checking the large, threatening and very impressive array of automatic weapons and even the RPG launchers they carry, while at the same moment a score of police, summoned to prevent the incursion, go rushing from their cars into the building not twenty feet away from where these killers are openly preparing for battle, weapons out in the open. Didn't a single one of those police bother to look around before they went into the building? They'd have easily spotted the gangsters not twenty feet away and still not prepared to fight. But then the dramatic final battle would have taken place outside, instead of just beyond the door to the lab, which was required to artificially pump up the ""Oh my God!"" tension of the moment.

Another issue is the form the film chose, which is to present itself as a serous scientific extrapolation of currently cutting edge but generally accepted concepts. A great deal of scifi doesn't bother trying to link itself to ""this is for real, honest"" presentation, such as was the basis for Carl Sagan's ""Contact"", a reasonable, logical exploration of how humanity might react with the discovery of intelligent life outside the planet Earth. In ""Lucy"" a great deal of time is spent presenting the background ""science"" about brain capacity so that the viewer will get that ""hey, this could actually happen"". But those explanations are meaningless, not tied to any real science and have all the logical weight of those pseudo-UFO documentaries who do nothing but ask lots of ""what if?"" questions and don't provide any hard science at all. But having taken the trouble to present itself as based in good, solid real science ""Lucy"" tosses all that aside at the first opportunity to morph into another high action thrill ride of chases and gun battles.

In fact, the movie doesn't even have any internal logic. A very effective early demonstration of Lucy's new drug-induced powers shows her knocking out a room full of deadly henchmen with a single casual thought. But later on, when facing yet another bunch of baddies, when that same skill would have solved her immediate problem very effectively, she instead chooses to levetate them, stick their weapons to the ceiling and summon up a solid force field to hem in the chief badguy. Visually impressive but only there to throw some other ""holy cow!"" sequence into the mix.

It's the same way with the car chases. There's really no reason to have them other than to liven up what is, at that point, becoming a rather dull recitiation of pseudo-science gobbledegook.

Even the characters seem to have little depth to them, other than to fulfill one limited purpose required by the action of the moment. Morgan Freeman is especially mistrated. After giving a rambling ""I'm only guessing here"" explanation of brain capacity use in the form of a high level scientific seminar, and being presented as the world's leading expert in the subject, from the moment he encounters Lucy he is reduced to standing around looking bewildered, almost as if he knows his job is to be the ears of the audience while Lucy, consciousness no elevated to superhuman levels, tried to explain what's happening to him in poetic terms, as if those are all he can hope to understand.

Even Johannson herself seems a bit lost as to how to portray someone with a superhuman consciousness. Her post-dosed performance consists of odd, off-center head movements in a mix taken from a curious robot and a confused dog.

And there's no sensible or logical reason why the main villian, a Chinese drug lord, would go so far out of his way to try and run her to ground and kill her, against all logical or human common sense, except if he didn't there would literally be no story at all.

All in all, ""Lucy"" is a perfectly fine action film hung haphazardly onto a thin, almost frayed, scientific idea with little if any real story to support it. Just check your brain, settle back and enjoy the explosions, the car chases and the spooky superbrain events. It's about all this thing has to offer.",1422835200,,6011,4.7682692307692305

In ""Lucy,"" the filmmakers present their ideas as what those answers might be, as we see this party girl quickly evolving over the course of but a single day...until, near the very end, we see the almost fully evolved Lucy...meet the very first Lucy, a hominid drinking water out of her cupped hand.  I think that everyone will recognize the meeting, or at least an image of a famous painting will come to mind.

So, here, we have a movie that is science fiction, almost an urban fantasy, and an action movie, all rolled up in one 90 minute show.  I've rented this movie from Amazon, and downloaded it- and over the course of the next 2 days, I will get to enjoy it over and over again.",1422748800,3,1055,4.087378640776699

The set up should have been done in 7 minutes, no more. Now the reason that this film deserves 5 stars: The storyline is fantastic and will cause you to wonder how great might we be if we reached our full potential. The cast did a good job in presenting this story but the action was tremendous, gun play, car races, that will keep on the edge of your seat. I don't give spoiler alerts so I will just say there is an added surprise ending.

This movie had potential, but fell short quickly.  Really bad science, even the premise of the film is bad science, and proven to be false in real life. It has been said that for fiction to be successful it must be believable.  This for me is where Lucy falls apart.

[**(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)**]
So what is so unbelievable?  Lucy has the ability to accomplish her goals while not getting innocent people killed, yet she chooses not to do so.

Not to mention there is an extremely broken part of the movie where Lucy just vanishes and every one is left with a ""What the heck, what is going on"" feeling. It is never explained how or why it happened.

Another really really annoying thing is the antagonist.  The antagonist is really bad fellow, yet how this characters plot draws out becomes more and more unbelievable (as in how stupid) as the movie goes on.",1422662400,,1150,4.382075471698113

Sure he has a great voice, but so does Sam Elliot and dozens of others, that is NOT acting.  The story line is simply ludicrous.  With all the lead-in brain science it is amazing the story could evolve into such total crap. Imagine if you will getting a 1 pound baggy sewn into your gut, then unsewn, and then resewn within 1 day and not be physically constrained in any way. Hmmm...I can't.  Well I could go on about a car chase through Paris that probably left several dozens dead innocents in its wake, or the murder of dozens of police all in the name of passing along DNA, but I won't.

The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.
Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job.",1422489600,2,962,4.344444444444444

Still, this was a good vehicle for future action endeavors for one of my favorite female leads in Hollywood. Although a bit wooden by design Scarlett Johansson showed she can carry a movie by herself and I look forward to any future films she does, especially those in the action genre.

This allows  her to become a sadistic, murdering ninja killer who defies gravity and reads minds and ...well, this brain enhancement is like a quantum leap in evolution...like we continue to evolve and become like the gods or Superman (woman) and join the Big Bang or something. If that made sense, then you may want to watch this stupid, violent muddle headed crap. Granted I left after about 45 minutes so I might have missed something really good but based on the other 150+ one star reviews I'm thinking I didn't miss anything except about 44 minutes of a very bad movie indeed. The thinking behind the movie is senseless, brain power = defying physical laws. Brain power = ability to kill with impunity because apparently police authorities fall asleep with that much brain power. For example Lucy saunters through a hotel lobby holding two very large guns on her way to dispatch so more bad guys, nobody noticed... called police... something?

Then she told me who the director was. There is soooooo much better smart sci-fi out there -- even the premise of this is hilariously dated.

It is a film that pushes our imagination, offers fascinating insights about the possibilities of brain function, and takes a different stance on fantasy thrillers.

Opening in Ethiopia we meet Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) and Richard (Pilou Asbk) - Richard is asking Lucy to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). But immediately Lucy is caught up in a nightmarish situation where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug. When the bag she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks, Lucy's body undergoes unimaginable changes that unlock her mind's full potential 100%. With her newfound powers, Lucy turns into a merciless warrior intent on getting back at her captors. She receives invaluable help from Professor Norman Morgan Freeman), the leading authority on the human mind, and French police captain Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked). Watching Lucy's expanding brain power provide extensive insights and control is astonishing and the entire film is enhanced by not only the intelligent words from Professor Norman but also the flashbacks to the beginning of life on the planet, dizzyingly fast forwarded to now and the world Lucy must face.

Try to pay less attention to the plethora of Chinese gangsters and focus on the intelligent possibilities and the film will remain in the back of your mind long after the credits run. Grady Harp, January 15",1422316800,2,1706,5.177536231884058

SPOILER examples: She shoots some guy on a hospital bed because ""he wouldn't make it because of a tumor"" So she can be operated on. Sooo, because she loses empathy as she gains more access to her brain, she forgets that regular humans are sympathetic? Morgan Freemans character EASILY excepts her word when she contacts him. No tests, No nothing. Just ""yeah sure Ill stay in Paris longer"" to meet some loon that could be good at parlor tricks. The cop believes her right away. The other ""brain scholars"" believe her RIGHT AWAY, just because she pulls some ""I'm psychic"" BS that could have been just as easy to google. Her Look throughout the movie SUCKS, about as clueless of a look as Mark Wahlberg in his films. They should have gotten together in this movie and even the viewer would be baffled by what's going on.

Writer & director Luc Besson stated that ""he admitted that he knew that some scientific assumptions were erroneous, e.g. that humans use only 10% of their brain. Nonetheless, he said that ""[such assumption] would be a great start for a sci-fi movie"".  Well, no that's not a good starting point if it's based on well known erroneous beliefs, in which case it classifies more as fantasy than sci-fi.  I knew that going into the movie, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief on that, but the nonsense just kept getting piled on.  Like when the drugs first start leaking into Lucy and she begins her ""transformation"", suddenly the laws of gravity are just thrown out the window  and she's floating around the room?  That's just dumb.  I mean you can't even say that she was harnessing the power of her mind at that point, she doesn't even know whats going on.  And it just goes on and on.  Yet somehow its still worth a watch I think if you just accept that its fantasy based on very little actual science.  Special effects and acting are top notch.

There isn't even an internal consistency to the plot that can pull you through the movie. It's a mishmash of the germs of one or two interesting ideas taken immediately to the point of absurdity.

For no reason, henchmen take our hero to a rape-room and ill-advisedly kick her repeatedly in the stomach, releasing the drug. Lucy then kills everyone, everywhere.

Besson continues his obsession with vulnerable young women becoming kick-ass killers but while this was novel in La Femme Nikita and weirdly cool in The Fifth Element, it's thinly sketched and downright bizarre in Lucy. Built on the oft-quoted and completely false premise of humans only using 10% of our brains, as our hero acquires more mental capacity throughout the flick, she also starts to develop supernatural powers that evade the laws of physics and massive outgun the bad guys.

Feeling more like video game weapons upgrades than anything constrained by a plot, Johansson storms through from scene to scene tearing up everything in her path. Apart from the lack of logic and common sense throughout, ultimately the failure of the film is that the hero is never in any danger or peril, making the bad guys look ever-less threatening.

Let's start with the fact that in order to express that her character had her emotions and humanity stripped from her, Scarlett J begins speaking in a monotone voice about 20 minutes into the movie and you have to hear it for the remainder. That alone offsets and flattens all the action in the movie. Then you've got Morgan giving terrible dialogue, no character development - he's sort of tucked in as ""college professor guy"" and doesn't really seem to serve much of a purpose other than to narrate the premise initially and then collect the outcome at the end. The plot itself is simplistic with no intrigue whatsoever: she gets some drugs in her belly, turns really boring but powerful, and creates havoc while being sort-of chased by bad guys. There's a French cop who also serves no purpose, but at least they admit that with some lame reference to her needing him as a reminder of her humanity. She kisses him to illustrate it, but it looks clumsy and vaguely embarrassing. Honestly, I'm hugely forgiving for most bad movies but this one felt like a big waste of talent all round.

I felt like they were just there to make the movie longer then 1 hour.  All the sudden jumps to scenes from africa and other things did almost nothing for the plot and made the movie very slow and plodding along.  The bad guys in this were unbelievable in the lengths they were supposedly going to to retrieve their drugs get Lucy.  Lucy was too cerebral for an action adventure, too much action/blood and gore to be a strict science fiction movie and just too weird to really be enjoyable to me.

I watch a movie to see something enjoyable and entertaining.  I do not watch a movie so that I can have a deep, dark intellectually stimulating disccusion with my co workers the next day.  The producers in this movie were trying to hard to mark an artful statement and forgot about producing a movie  most people would pay to see again and again.

When this ended, all my husband and I could say was ""wow"".  Yes it was shocking, but I will NEVER watch it again.  This reminds me too much of the books you were required to read for an english class that while you might have somewhat enjoyed reading them, as soon as you took the final test, you promptly returned the book to the library and never thought of again.",1422057600,,1336,4.3
6553568,3,B00M25EALG,"This movie was sort of eh. It had an interesting premise, but had a predictable plot. The acting was good by everyone, including Scarlett Johansson playing a monotonous super brain, but the script was similar to what you'd find in a hundred other science fiction movies.

The creativity level of the movie was remarkably low. The movie is filled with so many ridiculous tropes that you begin to wonder if the writer just went down a list of tropes to get ideas. An example is that the old dude is the villain, while a pretty young woman is the ""hero"". Another is that the more intelligent Lucy gets, the less human she seems. The intelligence has an otherizing effect on her, which is so common in cinema, television, etc. that it dulled any positive emotions that could exist in me about this movie.

There are so many moments where you know exactly what will happen and who will be doing what, which is so frustrating that I honestly wanted to scream. Dear Hollywood: a predictable science fiction movie is not entertaining. This should be the kind of movie that you watch and just can't get over how unique it feels and how intellectual it feels, but it isn't. It is bland. It has no real impact on the viewer.

The science should be captivating enough, but even it feels so watered down by a lack of understanding that there's nothing truly sparkling about it. It ends up feeling like the daydream of someone who has spent too much time watching the Saturday lineup of bad sci-fi movies on SyFy.

If there had been a little more originality and a lot less predictability, then I can see rating this a four or higher. As it is, I can only say it deserves as high as a 3 and that is truly pushing it. I feel that with the cast and the premise that it really could have been incredible. But it's awesomeness is limited so greatly by the reliance on archetypes, tropes, and clichs.

-This movie isn't for everyone. It has a decent amount of action and some stunning special effects, but never quite satisfies. It attempts to tackle huge human concerns like, what is the basis of our existence? What should be done with knowledge? What could we one day be capable of? but merely uses these advanced questions as a springboard for over the top scifi special effects and SJ waving her hand around a lot. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful in this film, but mostly just acts like a robot who has way too much power. It's hard to relate to a lead character that shows almost no human emotion. If i was looking for that I would have just watched ""Under the Skin"" again. Morgan Freeman is underused in this film as well, having a minimal role as a professor studying cognitive human functions. There's a french police officer in here, who serves no real function to move the plot along. I'll tell you right now, the ending sucks. And though the film is rated R, as the viewer, I felt like there could have been a lot more violence, considering Lucy can rip a persons atoms apart.

Scarlett Johansson is fun to watch, and that's the only reason it gets two stars. Otherwise, the science fiction aspect is just sad: using a higher percentage of brain power, exploding our ""cells"", reversing birth, and uploading the ""enlightened"" one into a computer so that she can be ""everywhere"".  The main character is the most one-dimensional, wooden ""enlightened"" person ever. The enlightened or quasi-enlightened people I have met laugh all the time and are overflowing with compassion and natural joy. The philosophical stuff is sophomoric in the extreme, and lecture-y. But the worst is the reliance on . . . . wait for it. . . . . yes. . . . . PICTURES OF GALAXIES . . . . to represent the main character's ascent into using a lot more of her brain. PICTURES. OF. GALAXIES.  Yeah, there's like 15 minutes at the end of an incredibly hokey montage of sparkly things flying around, galaxies, exploding cosmic lights and high speed cosmic blur.

Scarlett Johansson was great in this movie! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the ending left me wanting more. Overall, it was a very good movie.

Pretty well done on the acting,cinematography, and musical score. This movie probably won't be for everyone, but if you enjoy pondering the existence of life and what all that entails and enjoy a bit gratuitous violence thrown in the mix to ""tone down"" the deeply philosophical elements of the film in a balanced way then you'll probably really like it.

6553664,5,B00M25EALG,"I don't have the time or inclination to address all of the very odd and very negative comments that people have made about this superb movie. What I can say, however, is that to enjoy it to its full, you have to be pretty bright. The makers have never claimed that it is scientifically accurate. It is science fiction, after all. Having said that, it is true that humans do not (or are currently unable to) use their brains to full capacity. Of course, some people are cleverer than others, but we still have no idea what our brains are really capable of. I am an atheist, so I have no interest in the people who have criticized the movie because of its exclusion of God. That's absurd. The movie has nothing to do with God or religion. It's about the possibility that evolution could be speeded up accidentally (or even intentionally). I see no reason why this should not be possible. In fact, it is happening all the time. The polluted air we breathe affects the very makeup of our DNA.

The brain is a complex computer. Every once in a while, it gets an evolutionary upgrade in the same way that we upgrade our computers, cars, iPhones and iPads etc. We are all evolving. Every creature on the planet is evolving. We are not the same primitive humans who occupied the planet one million years ago. Nature and nurture have changed who we are, how we look and how we think. Now imagine what we might be able to do in 50,000 years if we haven't destroyed the planet by then. I am in no doubt that there are people amongst us who have very 'special' gifts; gifts that for many could only belong to the realms of science fiction. I am certain that there are people amongst us who can read minds and move objects with their minds. Some people are born with incredible strength, some with incredible intelligence, some with both. Some people can't see beyond their noses, while a few have the ability to understand the complexities of the universe. Now imagine what would happen if a drug or chemical were to appear that could push evolution along in leaps and bounds. Imagine what it would be worth. Maybe it already exists. This movie is not far-fetched. It is food for thought. But it is not for the closed-minded.

And by the way, the acting is great and the special effects are wonderful. There's even a touch of humour thrown in. Enjoy!",1421884800,4,2338,4.473067915690867

I myself want to watch a movie to be entertained and escape the troubles of the world for a couple of hours. So what if the science is not exact or the history is embellished for the sake of the storyline. That is what movies are all about, none of it is real, it's entertainment.
Now for the review of ""Lucy"". I found this film to be quite entertaining and fast paced. The FX were stunning. I won't write much else because by the time you get to my review you will have read enough reviews with spoilers to know what is going on in the movie. I only wished that it was a bit longer so that we could have gotten to know more about Lucy and perhaps what was on the .........

To a true cinephile, as many of the French intellectuals posture themselves as, this nutty conglomeration sounds like a cinema of the absurd scenario that even David Lynch or George Lucas would pass on--but director Luc Besson and his producer wife Virginie Silla pulled it off.

Scarlet Lucy is a hopelessly attractive American student living in Taiwan who gets suckered into becoming a CPH4 designer drug mule for Mr. Big.  She gets beat-up a lot and eventually becomes a pseudo-intellectual super woman who's unable to fly, after metabolizing some of the CPH4.  She flies off to Paris (with enough bloody money to be seated in first class) in order to meet Professor Norman (Freeman) and receive some fatherly cerebral advice from him.  Of Course Mr. Big and his minions are hot on her trail...and we've now entered the spoiler zone.

Crazy as it sounds, I loved this entertaining cyber-punk film (except for its endless gore). Its scientifically absurd premise that we use only ten-percent of our brains didn't bother me.  Hey, how much of our brains do we really use?

SPOILER ALERT

1. If my daughter called me from Taiwan talking about how she can feel everything and remember everything, my first thought is, you're on something, get to a hospital, I'm on the next flight. Instead, mom was a bit nonchalant about the fact that her daughter from the other side of the earth was calling at an ungodly hour talking nonsense.

2. If they fabricated this synthetic drug, the can easily do it again. Nothing is stopping them... the doctor was never killed. Maybe I didn't catch it, but was it explained somewhere that this was all? If so, no scientist in the world would give up the chance to get a fix of that stuff, let alone, let someone consume it all.

3. Serious mind mess when you consider if mankind was able to control time. I guess it's explained that if you get to that state of being, you're not thinking like mankind anymore, so your actions are altruistic. Dunno, need to think about that a little longer.

6553699,4,B00M25EALG,"I just watched Lucy on Amazon Prime Video last night. I really enjoyed it, it is a fun, exciting, and thought provoking science fiction film! I'm surprised at all the negativity it receives on the internet, really. I think the fake science behind the whole ""10% of brain"" concept, despite being make believe, was actually very interesting to think about sitting through the movie. The action was fun and there was a bit of humor in the right spots to make the movie not too dark or depressing. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and some of the film work, particularly in a sequence where Lucy is able to travel through time.

Although I think the movie does get unfairly bashed, there are a few weak points in the movie. Some of the general writing and direction had weaker sides to it. Some of the action sequences came off as more so cheesy than anything, and the movie included a Paris car chase scene that felt rather forced into the movie. The film is definitely mixed with some high and low points, but there were more high points for me, and in the end I really enjoyed it.

6553715,5,B00M25EALG,"First, I gave it 5 stars, to counteract all the crappy ratings it was getting.

Second, 4 stars is how I truly feel about it. I liked it.

I think the reason that it has received such low ratings, is that people do not understand what the movie is trying to say; ie what the movie is about.

To a degree,  that was probably due to the way it was marketed: ""A woman is done wrong and goes balistic with super human abilities and kicks butt."" WRONG.

The movie mainly has a SPIRITUAL message. It combines a little science, and religious teaching from several religions to try to posit a reason for our creation, our existence. When you look at it THAT way, it becomes intriguing..mainly because so few people try to do this in films.

BUT, the ideas are much higher than most people reach. Like total body fitness is more than most people attempt to achieve. SO most people only have a vague idea of what the ..little bits of philosophy are leading to...just like most people only have a vague idea of what they need to do to get and stay fit.( Even though the filmmaker put a ton of symbolism in the visuals, and a dab of science in the commentaries.)

This movie is about explaining why were we created. It takes it's clue to the path that it suggests is the reason of our creation by saying,
""Hey look, we have this huge brain, but most of us use less than 10% of it. Dolphins use more and have developed sonar. What would happen if we could use more?
Were we supposed to use more?
When we were first made, as animals did we use less? Yes.
And as we evolved, did we use more? Yes.
So if we evolve further will we use more of our brains? Probably.
So if we did, what would we be able to do then?  (the movie makes some suggestions in the enhanced abilities of Lucy.)

Then the movie asks: Why put this use unused portion of our brains in us, why didn't we just grow it as we evolved, like most animals?
Here's where the movie gets spiritual/ religious....
And it is probably because the writers were not clearer in their understanding that the movie was not clearer
For instance they named the main character ""Lucy"" after the first identified ancestor of humanity
It might have been a better clue for the audience if they had named her ""Eve.""

Because they are sort of connecting to this and that in both science and religion.  Eve might have been more appropriate because it was she that ate of the Tree of Good and Evil, prompting God to expel she and Adam...in the ""allegory"", so that they would not ALSO eat of the tree of Knowledge, and gain ALL knowledge so that they understood what God understood.

In the ""story of Eden""...(a story written in the Bible for children to explain on a level they might understand on) it explains to man that they were made in God's image. (thus the movie suggests...the huge brain, with huge capacity)  And were removed from Eden to prevent them from accessing the total capability of the brain by eating of the Tree of Knowledge (in the movie represented by the chemical CPH4 -- supposedly a compound manufactured by the mother in the 6th week of the fetus's life in a very minute quantity, that causes the fetus to rapidly develop and grow)

So essentially, in the movie you see the heroine be given the Tree of Knowledge and what happens to her.

Like many religious writers have noted, that as you progress along the path of knowledge about God, your consciousness becomes higher and the feelings...both good and bad...of normal humans become much less. So that love, and hate, fear and pain; are much less. You see this reflected in Lucy.

BUT though the movie uses understandings that many religious writers have come to understand...it also tries to create it's own new ideas of why we were made, what it all means. AND here is why it only gets a 4 and not a 5 from me. They were lazy.

For instance they suggest that the purpose of creating man was that the purpose of knowledge is to expand. In their conception, God is knowledge.

Then they say something along the lines that Time is everything. Time interprets everything.

I think study of God, and spiritual teachings, and even philosophy show that time is an artificial construct.
Philosophy argues, that what changes is not real, because what is real is permanent, and unchangeable.
I am not a scientist, but I think along those lines, science may argue that Time is simply a measure that humans use to try to understand the world around them.
The Bible tells us that God is present in the past, the present, and the future ALL at the same time. So this negates time as something that is real.
That it seems real to humans is that our bodies have a limited existence as we are currently experiencing them on a physical plain. But spirituality has always indicated that the physical world is illusion and only the spiritual world that continues on forever, the reality.

So in the movie, Lucy attempt to explain this as ""None of us ever really dies.""  Basically what Jesus tried to tell us, and show us, with his life and teachings.

So this is mainly a spiritual movie, marketed as a scary, sci-fi, slasher movie.  Which it is not even that.

There are NO nude scenes. Only a few sexually suggestive scenes. The violence is there, but serves a purpose more than not, and is not gratuitous, and not grossly bloody...like in Robo Cop.

It tries for artistic qualities, and maybe it does OK with that for instance there is a woman giving a manicure? to the head of the oriental bad guy group...and she has on her back a tattoo of what appears to be Mary (mother of G) but where Mary would be there is only a skeleton.  Then we see Lucy come striding down the hall in a surgery gown, billowing out like the tattooed picture. She is caring guns, and shoots through a closed door (this was confusing to me initially, because the movie expects you to just understand that Lucy by this time can see through objects, since she can also see the living energy in beings...) As the door opens you notice she has accurately shot all the mob's hench men and one is dying as as he does it looks like he is making observance to her as he bows down to the floor in death. (Thus Mary portrayed as death...get it...I know, sort of a stretch...sort of offensive) There were many more and varied instances of symbolism, trying to slip in little comments on what the movie was about, or what was about to happen.

The movie also tries to get you up to scientific speed by interspersing a lecture by a neuroscience about the capacity of the brain.

I think the movie could have done better without all the violence. I am wondering if maybe some of that was upped and marketed to sell the film to people that like that. IF so, the message is going to be largely wasted, as it was by the low ratings.

The acting was good=points. The movie flowed well=points, and seldom lost interest=points, except initially while Lucy argued with the man that wanted her to take a case in to the oriental group..but is attention getting enough so you could watch it a few more times. Where it probably lost points for most people was in confusion. Confusion of those there for blood and guts ...why it was not more of that and sex...and confusion of the sci fi group trying to understand the science...and irritation of the spiritual at some just lazy thinking.  Where it picked up points, is that for many movies,ANY attempt at thinking is rare.",1421798400,6,7411,4.460059171597633

I find this movie to be well done and it lifts the bar with some creative and new special effects not seen before in the sci-fi genre.

Fiction that is grounded in the known or at least theoretical sciences.  This movie is so much BS that after the first 10 minutes I felt that I was suffering through it.

Even worse is that this movie wasn't available as a rental, so I ended up paying the money to buy it.  Now I am stuck with it in my Library... uggh.

The other piece of this is that Scarlett didn't even look hot in this film.  Her hair was lame, and she didn't show her body off at all.  She had almost no personality in the movie either, because apparently when you get smart enough your personality vanishes and you turn into a computer.  BS I say.",1421625600,2,791,4.185430463576159

The explanations throughout the movie were so bad, cheap and utterly absurd that I couldn't stop laughing. Imposible to buy them even if you just want to have some fun. Very disappointing.
Scarlett is great as usual but the movie is a waist of time.",1421625600,,444,4.5625
6553769,1,B00M25EALG,"Yeah, I knew that the film had a stupid premise (at this point, every school kid knows that humans use their entire brain unless the brain is damaged), but I was willing to suspend disbelief (and disregard all of the online reviews which said how awful this film was) in order to watch what I thought would be ""Limitless"" with a beautiful female lead. What a mistake! If you loved ""Limitless"" (as I did) and expect anything remotely as clever, witty, and believable will play out here, you will be immensely disappointed. First, the dialogue is almost non-existent (save for Morgan Freeman's dire predictions about what a fully realised human mind can do). Seriously, almost no one else speaks. Second, in terms of the effects of the drug, it's more ""Inception"" than ""Limitless."" Freeman's character never explains why humans would become gods by fully accessing their brains (or why, as he proposes, if dolphins can access 20% of their brains, their cannot control the minds of other marine life as Lucy does with other humans when she reaches 20%. Clearly, no dolphin would ever be eaten by a shark if they could practice mind control). Nothing in this film makes even movie-sense. Third, I know this is a stupid point and a matter of taste, but Scarlett isn't looking so hot these days. If I'm going to be sold a movie based primarily on the lead's good looks, she needs to look better than my Chilis waitress. Lastly, the ending left me cold. It was so unsatisfying on so many levels. Spoiler: after acquiring all of the knowledge in the universe and witnessing the Big Bang, she transforms into black goo before ultimately disappearing into ""everywhere."" Freeman then states that she has discovered the true meaning of life. Huh? Did I miss that part? She had pronounced some mumbo-jumbo about how time, not mathematics or science, defines the universe, but how in the world is that the meaning of life? God? Gods? Afterlife? Reason for existence? Nope, just time. God, this was stupid. And never mind the fact that half of Paris is destroyed because the one person Lucy couldn't kill in cold blood is the drug lord who inserted the package within her when she had the chance back in Asia. We're supposed to cheer for this character who has no real purpose, no real personality, and who ultimately changes nothing. The world before Lucy's transformation is exactly the same as the world after her metamorphosis, with the exception of the many dead French cafe patrons, police, and the destruction of beautiful French buildings. I actually wanted the Chinese mobster to win in the end because she had caused so much pain and suffering for nothing. This is one of the worst nonAdam Sandler I have seen.

6553773,5,B00M25EALG,"Overall, a well done movie. Unfortunately, too many of the previous reviewers were looking for answers to questions they don't even have the right to ask. Fiction, at it's heart is about presenting an idea and creating characters who live out the idea through learning and conflict. I believe Besson and the cast did a fine job of presenting an idea of human potential. While much of it was founded in unprovable ""science"" (i.e., evolution), his premise and creation of the theme was well done and complete.

While many reviewers were disappointed with how the writer/director proved his premise, the beauty of fiction is that one does not have to complete prove the idea to make it believable. In this, making the story believable, I give this movie congratulations.

My only indecision was whether to give the movie 4 stars or 5. I thought about giving it 4 stars because I wished it was thirty minutes longer to explore Lucy's change. But, that it just enough evidence to say that the writer (Besson) did a very fine job in making me care about the characters.",1421539200,4,1063,4.7405405405405405

While I've grown used to seeing ""anything for a buck"" Freeman in bombs, Johansson is new to the game. The look on her face throughout was one of ""how did I ever let my agent talk me into this"" piece of crap. She's strong enough to recover but the film would have been a career ender for an unknown.

6553809,4,B00M25EALG,"LUCY is one of those innovative films that comes along and draws us in on an intellectual, emotional and visceral level. This is something that the original MATRIX did. It is a roller coaster ride of a film that seems to end too quickly, but you can return to it again and again. What is interesting is there is actual depth in its superficiality. Once again, style over substance can be very effective, but still not exactly save a film. The combination of thinking mans science fiction with the action film genre simply does not work. Director Luc Bessons images are captivating at times, but it is the action gunplay element of the film and Amr Wakeds stoic yet determined grimace that does save it. Ultimately, there is something very artificial about the whole concept. That may be an oxymoron, but see it for your self. Scarlett Johansson is Lucy. And once again the theatrical trailer did not give us exactly what it was advertising. There you have it.

Looking at LUCY again, I see it as more than a flawed film, but also a film where the central idea somehow got diverted, contorted and thoroughly lost somewhere from the time of its conception to the end result presented in the final product. But what is the central idea behind LUCY? Is it a drug trafficking film, an action film, a science fiction film, a suspense film or all of the above or something more? The trailer is very deceiving. It is interesting to watch Morgan Freeman and his character. He seems to be quite credible, quite intelligent, quite the authority on the potential the human brain harnesses and uses and how much energy and power we as humans utilize of that potential. That is very nice. Once Lucy shows up, it looks like Freeman cannot even add 2 plus 2 together. He seems lost, mesmerized, set adrift. What happened to him? Honestly, he does a meltdown. He is the kind of stereotypical character the viewer looks to for answers and direction. Forget about it. The power of the mind as its potential in real time seems to be pure speculation. Do they kill all the bad guys by the end of the film? Thats all I really cared about. Gloss just don't cut it in the end. But where did it all go wrong? That is what interests me.",1421193600,11,2210,4.525

You definitely cannot get high off it (though I will admit, I have never tried snorting a line).

6553878,4,B00M25EALG,"One star reviews?  No way.  Lucy is a movie with a message--a message that science seems to be illuminating slowly, a message that a lot of religious folk are afraid of.  Ironically, a message many ancient peoples had partially discovered.  But I digress.  I'm guessing the one star reviewers are somewhere between confused and afraid.  Because this movie is worth seeing AT LEAST once.  Very well-done.

Great action scenes.  Interspersed with thoughtful, educational scenes involving the main scientist.  And, in an artsy fartsy way, video snippets of the natural world to accentuate both the current plot and the points being made in the film.  But these scenes never detract from one another.

Watching Lucy unlock her brain's potential and essentially become a god is exciting and unsettling.  Johansson becomes a different person with each stage of development.  Very good acting.

This movie does not hold your hand or shove it's message into your mouth.  You have to watch, listen, learn, digest, and think all on your own.

 Plus, who doesn't like to watch a goddess destroy an Asian crime syndicate in the process?

Excellent sci-fi film.  You will not expect what Luc Besson writes an unlocked brain, an unrestrained human, can do.  Surprises await you here.

And not to put too fine a point on it, but I'm of the mindset if you're going to dabble in science fiction, you gotta get the basic science right. The screenwriter didn't even bother with the fact that we, as humans, use more than 10% of our brain all the time.  Basic, basic point that, if you're going to do a whole movie about it, might be worth looking up.  And if you're going to do a philosophy movie, you gotta get deeper than what you'd find in a pocket Buddhism book you picked up from the airport.

some other reviewers missed the message and the ending. Its a spiritual teaching delivered in a palatable way to appeal to many and not seem preachy.

The large amount of CPH4 pushes her past 20% brain capacity which begins her understanding that humans live based the 5 senses and are driven by greed, fear and power, It also moves her beyond pain so her choices are different. Humans think matter is real and build their lives around it when its really just an expression of energy, an illusion. she learns all of that is really unimportant and just obstacles to understanding who we really are. She knows her body won't survive long after the drug overdose so she calls the scientist to help figure out what to do. The scientist says ""pass on what you have learned"". so what she can pass on is all the new understanding and knowledge she is obtaining. To stay alive long enough to convey what she knows AND to try to get all the knowledge she can before her body dies ( reach 100%) she needs all of the drug packets. In the end she achieves exactly what she was trying for and doesn't die but slips to the other side of the veil, beyond time and matter, that's why she is ""everywhere""",1420502400,31,1255,4.447826086956522
6553883,3,B00M25EALG,"I love action movies and I love movies that give something interesting to think about. If you watch the preview of the movie, you've basically seen a condensed version of the whole movie, so I am going to discuss the ending and why it changed an otherwise 5-star movie into a 3-star movie (in my opinion).

The movie was interesting because it presented a big ""What if"" question; what if people could access 100% of their brain's power? The science is complete hogwash, of course. But it's still very interesting as fiction and I love hogwash movies just as much as anyone! But what keeps the movie from being great is the ending.

SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT

The end of the movie is supposed to be able the brain achieving 100% capacity. By that they mean every cell in the brain functioning at once. And the end of the movie, the character only has one brain cell (literally, one brain cell) and I guess it appears to be functioning. Now the drug just turns on more brain cells than are necessary to function. They're not supposed to be voodoo magic that gives cells Godlike powers. They just turn on the brain.

On a side note; she later has the ability to manipulate matter, yet she feels the need to go get the drugs that they created at the beginning of the movie. She could have just made the drugs herself by changing matter. She wouldn't have had to go anywhere. But apparently the character is so Godlike that she sensed we wanted a good movie, and so gave it to us, and ignored that silly bit of logic. Moving on!

So she just has one brain cell left. The only function the drug has is it activate all of the cells of the brain. That's it. And the peak of evolution (according to this movie) is to have one functioning brain cell. I find it ironic, because it takes about one brain cell to figure out what is wrong with this plot point.  You have billions of brain cells, and 10% of them are always functioning at 100%. If the drug killed off all but one, it didn't do anything. It's one cell. It can't do anything. Evolution makes things more complex, not less. Basically, this movie is like ""This one brain cell....it's FINALLY operating at 100%!"" So there's that stupid thing. Apparently, according to this movie, you should be sending out billions of text messages with the 10% of your brain cells that are currently operating at 100%.

Now don't get me wrong; that's not what ruined the ending for me. I could ignore how stupid that was if not for the end of the ending.

SUPER DUPER ENDING SPOILER WARNING TURN BACK NOW!

The movie ends with her disappearing, and then people wondering ""Where'd she go?""  and a single text message appears (not even a cool text message with a fancy animated background or anything) that says ""I'm everywhere.""

For one thing, a single cell cannot ""be everywhere."" So that was stupid.

I am not hard on fictional movies. I don't care if they are scientifically accurate or not. But if someone is going to make a fictional movie, at least make up a cool explanation at the end. Don't have the star of the movie disappear and leave a text message saying ""I am everywhere,"" after over an hour of film time. And the problem with the movie is that this is the real end of the movie!!

It has a lot of cool flashy stuff, one cell surviving to become the ""100% capacity"" brain cell (or what we living people would call ""brain dead,"") and then she just disappears. She leaves behind knowledge, but it doesn't show what people plan to do with it (they don't even have time to talk about it before the movie cuts out). It doesn't even attempt to explain what ""everywhere"" is. You don't know if she plans to communicate with people or do absolutely nothing for the rest of eternity. You don't know if she's supposed to be ""Godlike."" You don't know anything because it cuts off with a 2 or 3 word text message! They didn't even bother to do a fancy special effect and have her tell it to them. NOPE! A text message! That is horrible! I am actually starting to think that this movie was made by someone who hates those people who would rather text than talk. It's like ""I'm everywhere.......but....TEXT MESSAGE FOO! BLAM!""

If they did, and this entire movie was about the ending and trolling people with a text message as some sort of social satire, I take back my entire review and would gladly give this film 100 million stars. But I honestly don't think they did it intentionally, so I rate this film as ""meh.""

Without the bad ending, if they had just made up something to justify the time spent on the movie, I would have said 5/5 stars. I am not a picky movie watcher at all. The ending was just that MEH. Ruined a good chunk of the movie for me.",1420502400,5,4688,4.415990730011588

6553899,4,B00M25EALG,"This is my review of Lucy the film not the actual Blu Ray which I've ordered (haven't received yet but will update). When I saw Lucy over the summer I have to say in some ways I was pleasantly surprised. Even though it was touted as an ""action movie"" what it really is is a combination of 1/2 part Through the Wormhole hosted by Morgan Freeman, 2 parts The Matrix, 1/2 part homage to Anime like Akira and Ghost in the Shell (like another reviewer said), and another half part National Geographic or Discovery channel documentary (as also noted by other reviews). If you are keeping up with the math you may say ""Wait a minute that's only 3 1/2 parts"" - yea and that's the point, stylistically Lucy fits well with Luc Besson's other films like the Professional, but in terms of being an ""action"" movie it falls flat.

1) If you haven't seen the film and expecting it to be a ""Scarlett Johansson shoots em up aka Black Widow Avengers style"" prepare to be disappointed.
2) If you are willing to sacrifice some action for a slightly deeper philosophical film, then you probably will enjoy this film a little more, however even here the film doesn't do as good a job in the ""hmmn I wonder if that's possible"" department as say ""Limitless"" with Bradley Cooper or even the recent sci fi hit ""Interstellar"" although that's a completely different category of film. The biggest problem is that even if you buy into the idea of Lucy ""increasing her ability to utilize her brain capacity"" does this make up for her ability to defy the known laws and constructs of physics, i.e. walking upside on ceilings and stopping bullets Matrix style. And like someone else said this raises the inevitable question of if she had become this bad sass why didn't she use her new force style powers to take out the enemy with some sub-atom generated lightning or something (oops sorry confusing movie genres again - just like this movie does - that would be Star Wars anyway).
3) The insertion of the NatGeo and Through the Wormhole style narration aren't bad, and actually Morgan Freeman is used effectively as a narrator in that regard but it could've done without the Into the Wild footage.
4) IS LUCY WORTH SEEING? - Here it depends on how much movie viewing brain capacity you are willing to invest in this film. Like I said stylistically it goes along well with Luc Besson's other films, the special effects are good, and the overall cinematography - just don't expect a mashup of Scarlett Johannson as Jason Bourne&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Bourne-Collection-Trilogy-Import-The-Bourne-Identity-The-Bourne-Supremacy-The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B001XCWPAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Bourne Collection Trilogy (Import) (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)</a>&nbsp;and NEO&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Matrix-Trilogy-The-Matrix-The-Matrix-Reloaded-The-Matrix-Revolutions-Blu-ray/dp/B001CEE1YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Matrix Trilogy (The Matrix / The Matrix Reloaded / The Matrix Revolutions) [Blu-ray</a>]thrown in with a dash of Akira&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-25th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00ENNA62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;- or maybe do expect that, I don't know, I think I've spent too much unnecessary brain capacity reviewing this movie.

It goes to fundamental questions about consciousness. It challenges our every day perceptions about things. It does it all with a panache that only Luc Besson can convey.

And all based on a silly dated pop science myth, featuring Morgan Freeman in the same role you're used to seeing him. Scarlett Johansson does an excellent portrayal of Besson's misconception that geniuses are savants with no need for social graces. And like the silly ending of Interstellar later the same year, the plot concludes by going entirely cold turkey from reality and jumping entirely into magical thinking.

Set aside the absurdity and nestle in for profundity. Maybe only pretentious people like this kind of stuff. I guess that's why I loved it, and paid for a second movie ticket to see the immediate next showing. There's a special ephemeral essence to Besson's style in this film. The substance doesn't even matter so much as the style and texture of the experience. Brilliant film-making from a good (not great) screenwriter.

If most films are 10% of our brain's electrical capacity out of 100%, I give this film 15%.

I'm also tired of movies where the leads do stupid, stupid, stupid things, ""hey I'm becoming all powerful but while I'll kill innocent people to get what I want I can't hurt the uber bad guys too much because I need them to create havoc and drive the story line"". Again, what were the writers thinking, they couldn't make disposable bad guys.

6553919,3,B00M25EALG,"LUCY kicks off in Ethiopia, three million years ago, and ends in Paris, circa 2014. Throughout those two scenes, we travel to Taipei, Berlin, Rome, the Cliffs of Dover, Times Square in New York, and the beginning of the universe. We meet an Australopithecus, a dinosaur, Native Americans, a Korean gangster who trafficks drugs in other people's intestines, and a young blonde who is eventually the most powerful being ever invented in fiction. As Lucy's ""cerebral capacity"" increases throughout the film, so the film's restraint, logic, and credibility decreases exponentially. It's up to you to decide whether you like that or not.

LUCY's lack of restraint is pretty awe-inspiring. This is everything you love (or hate) about Luc Besson, cranked up about five thousand notches. Empowered female ass-kicker? Check. Slo-motion gun play? Check. Kinetic car chases? Check. Complete lack of logic, science, or intelligence? Check, check CHECK! Say what you want about this guy (I mean,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon/dp/B002O5M4SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon</a>&nbsp;is one of the best action films ever, while the Arthur films are a cinematic scourge), Luc knows how to shoot action like NO one else, edit his films in a kinetic, stylish, and breezy manner, and keep the lower parts of your brain engaged while convincing your upper functions to take a break for the day.

Here's what he can't do (and subsequently what LUCY fails at): Write realistic dialogue.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarlett-Johansson/dp/B00JH3S0AI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarlett Johansson</a>&nbsp;has proved that she's a more than capable actress, but when she tries to deliver a Besson Monologue, she's left delivering nonsensical musings on the codified scale of humanity, and how sounds are ""music that she can understand"", and whatnot. It's absurd and quite frankly embarrassing. What else can't the great Besson do? Well, subtlety is not his strong point. He inter-cuts scenes of Innocent gazelles being slaughtered by Evil cheetahs because SYMBOLISM! Characters, plot, realism, drama, and science all fall under the sweeping blows of entertainment.

But ask yourself, is that really such a bad thing? HELL NO! No one goes to see LUCY to see realism and drama. They came to see Scarlett Johansson wield unfathomable power in a little black dress. And if that's your modus operandi, get ready to be royally entertained! LUCY is stylish, kinetic, packed with action, over-the top, visually stunning, edited for maximum impact, filled with stupid science and brilliant action, crazy characters and awesome visuals. And oh yeah, the acting... Scarlett is good as Lucy, mastering the innocent drug mule and the all-powerful mega brain alike. She transcends the absurd and silly writing to be memorable and likable (even as she pins a guy's hands to a sofa with combat knives). But the biggest treat of the movie is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Choi-Oldboy-Min-Sik/dp/B0009S2T0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Choi ""Oldboy"" Min-Sik</a>&nbsp;as the evil Mr. Jang. He's one of the best action movie bad guys I've ever seen. He's deliciously evil, subtly nuanced, and completely memorable. See him go to town with two machine guns...

As for visuals, LUCY is visually stunning, filled with eye-catching images, beautifully photographed, and filled with wondrous imagery (if only the screenplay held up). Oh, and the action: it's worth the price of admission alone. Explosive, fast moving, bloody, and stylishly over-the-top, this is truly Besson's best work since Leon. So know exactly what you're getting when you go in to see LUCY:
A completely silly, absurdly over-the-top and unrealistic film, and paradoxically, a smarter than usual blockbuster film that'll keep you riveted from start to finish. Uber-cool performances transcend the terrible dialogue, while the electrifying action and lightning pace make this an explosively awesome way to spend 90 minutes of your life. LUCY, ironically, is not a movie made by people using their full ""cerebral capacity"", but its ambition, crazy lack of restraint, and sheer sense of fun might just make it up for you...

Yeah, LUCY is a stupid movie. But for humans who apparently only use 10% of their brain, that's sometimes EXACTLY what you need! So crank up the volume, get out the popcorn, turn off your brain, and let Lucy do the rest.

Lucy gets forced into being a mule carrying a new drug implanted in her gut.  Punch her in the gut and watch the fun begin as the drug expands Lucy's utilization of her brain and gives her progressively more and more super-powers.  Don't expect the story line or the ""scientific"" explanation (provided by Morgan Freeman) to make sense - this is just supposed to be fun - and it is.  As an example of something nonsensical, Lucy wastes a Taiwanese cab driver for the sin of not speaking English and then later leaves the drug kingpin alive with only an ouchy when she has him at her mercy.

The early violence in the film is almost gratuitous until you realize it's there to remind us selfish opportunistic thoughts are usually what we wind up using this kind of opportunity on..  The contrast becomes apparent as she goes above it all, to remind us that all that power could be used for good, in the right hands.

The premise was solid. Johansson's performance was spot on. I liked her evolution and towards the end it gels very nicely. The film does have some over the top violence but that's nothing new for Besson. What made it work was callous nature of those in vengeful pursuit of their ""product"".
For me this was the right mix of all the right elements, in the right sequence, with a powerful but not overstated finish. Like life, it was sometimes messy. Like life it was also a heaping dollop of, ""just get over it and move on from here"".
I can give a lot of guesses why it was not better received by some viewers. It broke from a lot of standards while at the same time using them to great advantage to advance the story. Since the shoot-em-ups weren't enough like standard revenge fantasies the action seekers were disappointed. The cerebral were looking for smart with a little sexy. Unfortunately that was not the role Johannson was playing -and for good reason. Freeman's role as the scientist with a clue but not a cause was perfect. Smart, receptive and resourceful doesn't play well with the theater crowd, not for this kind of setting, but it's exactly why I like it. The irony is the violence was not the star of the film. It was just occasional window dressing after things got rolling. It's also a beautifully filmed movie with a lot of humanity shining through, which it could have easily jettisoned but wisely chose not to.

I plagiarized that opening synopsis from another reviewer as I found it to be a well-written description of what this film attempted to accomplish. I rarely take time to review movies, despite some real stinkers I've seen this year (i.e. Noah), but ""Lucy"" warranted special attention as Luc Besson has accomplished a rare feat. He made an 89 minute movie feel like four hours. The fault does not lie with Scarlett Johansson's emotionless performance. She does the best she can with a disaster of a script, and she brings the only highlight this film has to offer: A very attractive young woman running around in a short dress.

The movie itself fails in every other category, but I want to emphasize that the real disaster that nobody seems to have picked up on is that this idea entirely mimics the 1992 virtual reality sci-fi classic ""The Lawnmower Man"". Granted, Jeff Fahey didn't look as good as Scarlett Johansson, but the premise is entirely the same right down to the very last scene when the protagonist of each story become energy and are absorbed in every electronic device around the world. The plagiarism couldn't be more obvious if Luc Besson entitled his rendition ""The Lawnmower Woman."" Fortunately for Besson, people have a short memory, and they came out in droves to see this clunker.

6553939,1,B00M25EALG,"This movie started off on a good enough note, but once a person continues to stay tuned it does't make me but help wonder why was it ever made in the first place? What was the original purpose of this motion picture?

Everything major about this film almost leaves you hanging and not in a good way. Even the title itself makes you question the writers imagination.

So, Lucy the main character played by Scartlett Johansson gets kidnapped and is forced to transport a bag of drugs that was originally supposed to be delivered from her boyfriend to a powerful drug lord. The drug lord kills her boyfriend, kidnaps her, allows his minions to physically abuse her, operates on her in a cruel manner and inserts a bag of drugs into her abdominal area? All in a span of one day or so. However, the plan backfires because unknown to them when the drug is leaked to Lucy's blood stream through a whole in the bag she possess these super natural human powers and is able to access 100% of her brain.

So in a coarse of three days or a week at most, Lucy with the possession of her new powers kicks, steals and flies from one place to another in a really high speed all for the purpose of nothing.

How did the drug contribute to her new found abilities to begin with? Why is no one concerned with a stream of drug smuggling going around? Why is everyone who ever came to knowledge of Lucy's powers seems oblivious about it? Why is she running around in the first place?

This movie is unrealistic and a tad confusing, not to mention the basic concept of drugs making ordinary people geniuses that has been done before in past films. Watch *limitless* if you haven't already.

The big flow this movie had for me was the lack of plot. It's not that there wasn't a plot but it just wasn't complete. It's almost like the writers were trying to keep this movie as original and as fresh to the audience in order not to compare it to different movies similar to it but they just didn't know how and so they made it into this entire mumbo jumbo.

My advice, skip this film but it's up to you.

6553941,5,B00M25EALG,"This is Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Professional) doing what he does best  taking a mash-up of film genres and seamlessly blending them into 128 minutes of pure enjoyment!! Luc Besson's directing is top notch, Scarlett Johannson acting is as always captivating (ALWAYS a plus to have a strong leading woman), and the special effects of George Lucas' former company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM  - Star Wars movies) are the best in the industry. What we get is a film that defies classification as it takes cues from so many genres including action, science fiction, drama, international crime thriller, super hero flick, Hong Kong streetfighter, police procedural, NPR Ted science segment, philosophy book, and a Luc Besson' movie (yes he deserves his own category!) to answer one thought provoking question  what would happen if I could use 100% of my brain's capacity. Due to a drug deal gone wrong we see Lucy being forced to become a drug mule carrying a new experimental drug formulation. After an Asian crime syndicate thug decides to cop a feel for the second time to a bound and bonded Lucy, she receives a powerful kick that breaches the contents of the experimental drug packets that have been hidden inside her, forever altering her. From there, the movie kicks into high gear as she escapes from the drug all the while experiencing changes to her mind and physical abilities as the drug gradually increases her brain's capacity. You really become engaged with Lucy on her quest to understand these changes and Morgan Freeman (portraying a leading scientist) plays a critical role in understanding the science and philosophy of it all. Of course no Besson story can be complete without an ample supply of angry drugs lords hunting their quarry, excellent car chase scenes, extremely creative hand to hand combat (with super hero telekinesis), superb over the top gun battles, multiple international law enforcement agencies, and of course the always strong leading actress! To that end, I have always enjoyed Besson's portrayal of strong, classy, well developed women and NOT damsels in distress for his leading roles. And in watching Besson's movies it always strikes me to the close similarities in terms of stories, visuals, and character development as you see reminiscent of French graphic novel titles from Humanoids who published such works as Alejandro Jordorowsky's The Incal, The Metabarons, Madwoman of the Sacred Heart, and Enki Bilal's The Nikopol Trilogy.

While the science can be silly and simplistic, the film still strives for an ambitious answer to what the limits of human evolution hold for mankind. While this sort of subject matter could've been the dry subject of a stiff documentary, instead it is the premise for this insanely wild and kinetic action movie. It is a wonderful mashup of hi/lo ideas, like 2001 meets Spider-man.

Any one familiar with director Luc Besson's work, (The Professional, Fifth Element) knows that his films are quite cool, stylish, fun and exciting, and ""Lucy"" is no exception. So besides thrilling action scenes and special effects, the film also has an abundance of playful humor with its outlandish ideas. The film's only fault is some occasionally stiff dialog and exposition to help propel the story forward. But indeed, this action film is even funnier than most modern comedies.

Another applicable genre for this movie is ""superhero."" While ""Lucy"" does not specifically adopt a mask and codename to fight crime, it is still a story of a woman who gains super powers. However, the film smartly divests itself from any one specific skill, and instead allows her an infinite amount of power to bend matter, space and time in anyway she can conceive.

A final pair of bonus points for the rare blockbuster that features an original story, and a woman hero. Either characteristic is hard enough to find these days, but to have both in one film is a refreshing joy.

The cinematography and the actual editing of the film is fantastic.  Scarlett Johansson does an excellent acting job.  Morgan Freeman is a good supporting actor but not his best work.  Lucy is a polarizing movie and mixed reviews are to be expected.  Go in with an open mind, remind yourself this is mostly sic-fi and not based on fact (besides some aspects of the movie), and enjoy the show.  I've seen this movie twice in theaters now (once when it first came out, and once last night at the 2nd run movie theater).  The first viewing was definitely the best because I didn't know what to expect, and the 2nd viewing I was able to better appreciate the camera work and the finer details that go missed at first.",1413072000,6,995,4.483333333333333

But,  Luc Besson came through again. He is truly my favorite director.
More than anything this movie reminded me of one of my favorite anime, ""lain.""  In fact it is sort of an updated version in many ways. Both deal with the question of what it means to BE.  Not just exist, but to understand where you are; what you are.  While there was a lot of the movie that seemed included to catch up the slow in the audience, it was similar to Donnie Darko in how it challenged the basic idea of just what our reality is.
I really enjoyed the choreography but then a bit of Luc's intellect would show through the curtain to remind you what he was on about.

All of  Luc Besson's movies are anime with live people but some work better than others.  Immortal and Fifth Element tried too hard to be mighty, Pan's Labyrinth was perfection.  Lucy is somewhere in between.",1413072000,4,1003,4.320855614973262

The other option was to have a philosophical movie that answers all of your questions about life, the universe, and everything.

First of all, Johansson has a great voice, an unbelievably sounding
voice that supersedes even that of the other super voice, that is
of Morgan Freeman.
The story is more that of a sci fi movie. Because of some synthetic
drug that drug lords have stored in her stomach, and see accidentally
absorbs in large quantities, she manages to access larger and larger
portions of her brain making her capable of super human powers.
Well there is a twist in all that but you must watch the movie for that....

All in all it is not a bad movie, but it is really a weird one and you should
be prepared that you are going to watch something unusual",1412985600,,778,4.321917808219178
6553956,1,B00M25EALG,"I try never to give away spoilers in my reviews, but my problem with this film is mostly going to contain a few spoilers, so please go to the next review if you don't want to read a bunch of spoilers.

Lucy is about a woman whom her recent boyfriend tricks her into delivering a package he was supposed to deliver himself. Once she lets reception at her destination know she is here to deliver the goods, she is taken against her will upstairs to some crime boss who has his goons cut her open and place the drugs she is delivering inside her intestines, with a few other people, and they are to be sent all over the world to smuggle in the goods. Meanwhile Morgan Freeman is giving lectures that humans only use about 10% of their brains, or round about that percentage, and has a few theories on what the human brain might be possible of if we could access more and more of it... yet unknowing what might happen if you could access 100% of it? Guess what? The drug inside the stomach of our female lead star is a brain enhancing drug! So guess what happens to the bag it's concealed in? That's right! How did you guess? You must be blessed with 11% brain power or something! Lucy's brain then starts opening up and gradually throughout the film she accesses more and more of her brain until she becomes a Jedi USB device.

Now... major spoiler alerts.
The theory of accessing that much of your brain is one thing, but the moment the drug enters Lucy's system, she becomes a ninja master. You could perhaps say she is now smart enough to mathematically analyze a situation, and execute it with precise timing and what not... however, I have a hard time believing you just work out a plan in your head and execute it. So, practicing something is not what aids your intelligence, we are just so dumb we have to practice to remind ourselves how to do something naturally, yet we're never needed to be taught it in the first place, it's just there? Come on... you learn, you practice, you don't just get smart and can figure out how to do anything.

As Lucy's brain progresses to open up more of her brain capacity, she begins to become a fricken Jedi Knight and can move things with her mind, sends people flying across rooms with her thoughts, and then turns herself into a bunch of black tar to eventually become God, leaving herself behind in a USB.... OK, I'm done here. I feel stupider for having sat through this rather than beleive that if we could access more of our brains, it turns us into Dr. Darth Carrie, The Digital Jedi Master & Time Lord.

The theory of the film was interesting, up until it just become a badly thought out plot that just wants to make a Star Wars meets the Matrix special effects film of a witch power-like ninja-woman, all because she accessed her brains full potential? Sorry, I don't buy it, and it insults me we're supposed to buy this crap? Overall, it's a plot done many times before, just bringing different elements of it together to make a mind numbing special effects movie. I could perhaps beleive there might be a small chance that clairvoyance and what not might be a possibility, I doubht it, but as far as anything in this film, that's as far as I could suspend belief here, but then she starts to see radio signals, can home in on cell phone calls, see life forces everywhere....COME ON... the human brain was designed to see digital signals was it? Gimme a break. Shes still human, not a fricken robotic cyborg.

My biggest thing against this film is it's a proven scientific fact that humans do use use more than 10% of the brain. It's a common myth that you only use a small percentage of it. In-fact we use most of it, or alot more than you would think, and parts of it are accessed during different times, such as when you're awake or when you're asleep. Various parts of the brain are for various purposes. You can find more about that out for yourself, you have the internet now, use it if you want to learn more about that. From that point in the movie, my own brain was just telling me to find flaws in this stupid movie, rather than try to suspend belief and attempt to enjoy it.

If you can beleive that if humans could access more of their brains they can become Jedi Terminators, then by all means, check out this film, but if you can't beleive fantasy sci-fi of the things I have mentioned here, and they just sound ridicules to be possible, then be smart about it, and make a good decision about not wasting your time here. It's a special effects movie for those dumb enough to buy into it's mind numbing sci-fi plot that humans who can open up 100% of their brain power, they become a fricken USB device right after being a ninja.... sigh...

6553959,3,B00M25EALG,"Cinemas fascination with what might come from an evolution in human intelligence is as old as film itself. Thus, finding fresh, original ideas for these kinds of films is often a lost cause. However, if you like your Limitless with a side of Tree of Life, then Lucy may be the ticket for you this weekend.

The latest film from French director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Family), Lucy stars Scarlett Johansson in the title role as a student living in Taiwan whose boyfriend tricks her into completing a drug deal that has some unexpected consequences. When the drug deal goes sour, Lucy finds herself face to face with drug kingpin, Mr. Jang (Oldboys Min-sik Choi) who threatens to kill her unless she acts as his drug mule. Lucy is forced to transport Jangs newly synthesized drug by having it sewn into her lower intestine, but when an altercation results in the drug leaking into her bloodstream, Lucy discovers that the drug has an unintended side effect of increasing her cerebral capacity. Now, armed with brain functionality that dwarfs that of the average person, Lucy goes on the warpath to seek revenge against Jang and his outfit. In order to keep the film from becoming a routine revenge film and to instill a bit of legitimacy to Lucys agenda, Besson introduces Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), a brain researcher who advises Lucy to act as any thriving organism does and attempt to pass down what she learns for future generations.

As I stated earlier, this is not the most original idea ever put to film, but Besson does put his artistic spin on it and successfully creates what is easily one of the best films he has ever directed (which to many is not saying much!). As we are reminded over and over, the average person uses 10% of his or her brain, but Lucy discovers that once 20% is reached, the rest falls into place like dominoes. Soon Lucy discovers that her body requires doses of the drug to survive, resulting in further increases of brain functionality, but she finds that she cannot sustain 100% cerebral capacity making her a paradoxical ticking time brain. Lucys journey to unlock the secrets of the universe and kill a drug lord does feel a bit unbalanced at times. Furthermore, at a svelte 90 minutes, the film also seems a bit hurried and cheesy at times. It is also a surprisingly violent film with plenty of on and off screen casualties that do not seem necessary or prudent to the story. The film is strongest in its set-up where Besson cleverly splices metaphorical imagery into his narrative to an almost subliminal effect. What is proven is Johanssons charm and strength in the genre (Lucy almost feels like an audition for the upcoming Black Widow, Avengers spin-off that will star her and is now in production). Regardless of its faults, this is an artsy and visionary little slice of sci-fi that is worth checking out. B

1. National Geographic like montages to show the importance of what is happening.
2. Lectures by Morgan F.( I guess he got a mortgage to pay too) to explain what is and what will be going on.

6553976,5,B00M25EALG,"""Lucy"" (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi).

It should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powder/dp/B0060D0IYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powder</a>"" (1995) and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phenomenon/dp/B0060D3RRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phenomenon</a>"" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while ""Powder"" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Youth-Without-Youth/dp/B0083GO400/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Youth Without Youth</a>"", a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include a remotely entertaining story.

""Lucy"" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Lucy"" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, ""Lucy"" is stylish and ""hip,"" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizazz.

Some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality.

What's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?)

In regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other ones noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?

Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.

Less spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, ""I was thinking the exact same thing."" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge."" Although they're exaggerated in the film they're REAL.

""Lucy"" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time ""partying"" and pursuing a ""cute guy with nice buns"" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to ""All things in moderation""? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.

My praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy?

The film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 89 minutes and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.

Its like all the deleted scenes from The Fifth Element, Limitless, and Kill Bill were put in a hat and pulled out at random.

Scarlett Johansson plays the films heroine Lucy, who, after getting involved with an international drug cartel, becomes that person. Watching the process of Lucy an ordinary 25-year-old woman turning into a sort of superheroine is certainly fun, especially in scenes where she displays her newly acquired powers with some off-the-wall humor, but as the film goes on, it becomes clear that writer/director Besson is running out of ideas.

With the films premise that gives too much advantage to the heroine, the story inevitably goes nowhere, despite the strong acting from Choi Min-sik as the boss of the crime syndicate. Morgan Freeman appears as Professor Norman giving some advice to our heroine, but as in Transcendence he is mostly wasted.

Some spoils; Lucy gets mixed up being a drug mule thanks to her boyfriend. Lucy is a ditzy party girl, but along the way to her destination as drug mule with the drugs inside her she gets roughed up and the bag of drugs in her stomach breaks and leaks inside of her. This drug is described to be a synthetic version of a chemical a fetus gets from its mother for rapid growth and development within the womb. Due to this exposure, Lucy's is receiving the boosted potential to unlock the unused percentages of her brain.

Within each new milestone in Lucy's brain development, she gradually begins to gain control of cells first within herself granting her vivid recollection of all of her memories. She then begins to have the ability to control the cells of others and the matter and frequencies around her and even shape shift the cells within herself. As her brain is progressing she becomes ""less human"" as in less primitive and becomes more cerebral, analytical, which contrasts her former self. She slowly loses senses of pain and emotional feeling as well as humanity as she's becoming more aware of everything. This movie plays with the idea that all cells are related/connected and recycled or passed down. Lucy is capable of doing all these incredible things not because she's just a person with random super powers all of a sudden, (though that's the simple outlook on it) but she gains control because she becomes one with herself, then the living organisms around her, next surrounding matter, the entire world and then eventually the entire universe and all existence. This is how she is able to accumulate all this data because ""energy and mass is neither created or destroyed"" and she is gaining access to it by establishing that connection. After all, in one of the high speed chase scenes where she takes the wheel and her passenger is in fear for his life she says, ""We never truly die.""

If there's anything to be gained from this movie that I think a lot of the negative reviewers might miss, is any underlying messages. What's truly important in our daily life? What are we amounting to in the eyes of others? Are we doing anything to achieve greatness? This movie strongly illustrated that knowledge is power, as well as importance in our awareness internally and externally. What steps are we taking to acquire all the knowledge we can? Time was a huge factor as well in this movie. How are we spending what time we have left in this Earth? Are we using it effectively/efficiently? Are we contributing anything to humanity whatsoever?  There was a line something to the effect that ""We humans are more concerned with having than with being."" If this is true then what are we doing to live in the moment, or are we even doing anything to be the best version of ourselves we can be? Are we going to go through life like a ditzy blonde trapped in our blinder of primitive thoughts and emotions, wrapped up in our own wants and needs or are we going to take a step back and realize what things are truly important in our existence and what kind of relationship we have with others, the world we live in and with ourself?",1410134400,11,3741,4.645015105740181

6553981,2,B00M25EALG,"If you want to see a film with the beautiful Scarlett Johansson prancing around in a short black dress and high heels showcasing her beautiful legs, than ""Lucy"" is for you.  If you want to see a film that makes a bit of sense, you might want to see something else.
""Lucy"" concerns a ditzy student who is forced to take over for her moron boyfriend in delivering a package to a vicious Asian criminal mastermind.  Just Lucy's luck, she and a few other unfortunates are forced to swallow bags of some experimental drugs that are going to be smuggled into various cities.  After she fights off one of the criminal thugs who tries to rape her, one of the bags opens and leaks into her body.  As a result of this, Lucy gets to use way more of her brain power than the 20% a human allegedly uses and starts developing almost superhuman powers.
As the film moves on, it gets dumber and dumber.  For instance, despite the fact that she has no compunction in simply blowing away the criminal bosses' underlings, she makes no attempt to actually give the audience some satisfaction by killing this despicable character herself. (In one scene, she is absolutely in a position to destroy him.  Yet, she inexplicably shoves some knives into his hands and lets him live.)  It is left to the French police to kill him in a ridiculous shootout between the police and an army of criminals at the end.  In another silly scene, she forces a group of criminals to float upward to the ceiling.  Yet when she leaves the room, rather than falling they just remain there.
She helps the police to catch the remaining drug smugglers by somehow remembering the airline tickets they were using to go to various cities in Europe.  In a scene similar to whats seen weekly on the tv series ""Unforgettable,"" she just remembers the locations on the tickets.  Yet there is no indication in the film that she even saw the tickets, so how could she remember them?
This is just one bit of silliness in a silly film.  Eventually she evolves into a higher life-form, journeys into the past, meets a dinosaur and helps bring about human evolution.  Sort of a dumber 2001.
Scarlett looks great as usual and Morgan Freeman is on hand to provide dialogue of pseudo-scientific gibberish.
This type of plot was done better several times on the first season of the original Star Trek including the pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before.""

6553982,4,B00M25EALG,"""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale"" says Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) by way of summation of the insights she has achieved under an accidental overdose of a new and powerful synthetic drug.

This is to date Johansson's best performance,  full of tight close-ups on her face as her character nonverbally radiates a dimensionality seldom seen on the screen.  I suspect that Evan Rachel Wood's Dolores Abernathy character in HBO's ""Westword"" was influenced by Johansson's take on her title character.  Both characters drift seamlessly in and out of a distanced robotic mindset.  Especially remarkable is Lucy's overseas phone call to her mother.

""Lucy"" is a philosophical film being marketed as science fiction - action adventure.  Since it worked for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" back in 1968 I guess they thought it would work here.  But the mismatch has caused ""Lucy"" to miss much of Luc Besson's intended audience and to disappoint those looking for Scarlett doing a ""Leon"" inspired ""Kick-Ass"" number in tight shiny ""Black Widow"" latex.

The mismatch between the film and its promotional campaign is my only major criticism.  A minor criticism is the poor quality of the digital effects (the car chase doesn't  hold a candle to the old fashion way, insert 1998's ""Ronin"" here).  Given the budget limitations, the POV, and the transforming mental condition of the title character; the film would have been far better served had Beeson substituted expressionism for realism.  Cinema greatness was there for the taking.

As in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" the existential theme is not anti-God (or even pro bermensch), but anti-ego.  With a character slowly losing their connection with humanity, finally connecting with the infinite at the moment they become infinitesimal.

I can't say enough about the role played by Morgan Freeman, and the clever way in which the stage is set for us to  begin this exploration of the central concept of the movie: past and future development of the human mind - and more! The magic of this movie is the way in which the mind blowing intellectual content is beautifully integrated with stunning action scenes and chase scenes...in fact, some of the best chase scenes I have ever seen!

The movie says nothing about God and theological meaning but I connect this movie with theological messages. Anyway, in the movie Lucy, you may recognize these messages:
- Our brain's limitation shows that we are not good enough to possess complete the brain capacity. We are possible to reach its capacity but nothing guarantees that we will have this without danger. We just use only 10% of its capacity but you may see how much evil that make humanity suffer. Divine wisdom sets this to avoid the damage of this life on earth. In order words, human freedom, especially evil freedom, creates an unsafe environment for our full abilities.
- ""We never really die,"" says Lucy. Perhaps, we need to see how God wants us to experience the everlasting life, the after-life because humanity doesn't live a good life according to God's commandments. We struggle to communicate with others, with creatures, and with God. The retrievals of Lucy's memory at the end are what we need to touch in creatures in space and time. Human selfishness leads them to a corrupted life. We must wait for our temporary deaths will be transformed by God's mercy in the day of judgment.
- ""I am everywhere,"" say Lucy. I cannot compare this saying with the characteristic of God: OMNIPRESENCE, but in some ways, Lucy helps us to understand that ""to be everywhere"" requires our efforts to imitate the perfect life of God so that we when we possess 100% brain's capacity. We will be like God, the Almighty. At the same time God is still merciful and shows God's love to all creatures, especially humanity.

6553994,3,B00M25EALG,"I'll say this for LUCY...it doesn't start slow and it seldom lets up.  The violence begins immediately and there's rarely a ""dull"" moment thereafter.  This is a movie that also works hard, via cinematography, editing, lighting to fetishize Scarlett Johansson.  Certainly she always cuts a striking figure, but director Luc Besson doesn't pull off anything on par with (for example) what Tarantino did with Uma Thurman in the KILL BILL movies.  He used his star almost like another special effect.  He actually worked Uma in such a way that there was some talk of ""Oscar nomination"" after the first film.  Besson seems to be striving for the same thing here, and certainly some of the fight scenes also evoke a KILL BILL vibe...but he's just too heavy-handed.  And Johansson is just a bit too stoic and vacuous in the role.

You may have gathered that the ""science"" of this movie is silly.  And it is.  I don't care how carefully it is delivered to us via Morgan Freeman's silky tones...it is garbage.  If you want to see a decent (still silly, but decent) use of the old ""what if we could use more of our brain that no one accessses"" idea, watch LIMITLESS.  Suffice it to say that Lucy, who starts out as a bit of a do-nothing, accomplish nothing American on a foreign land, is exposed to a chemical that will unlock 100% of her brain.  And it seems like the more brain power unleashed, the duller and stupider Johannson looks.  I gather she's turning inward, beginning to internalize all the amazing things she's experiencing...but to the viewer, she just looks empty.  I know some people think she's a great actress (and in movies like DON JUAN, she does actually bring some energy and excitement), but her schtick (""look, my lips are big and my eyes are big and I can talk without really moving my facial muscles"") has grown pretty thin.  I know she's won lots of ""sexiest this, that or the other"" accolades...but when I see a movie, I'd like to see good actors.  This doesn't mean I think Judi Dench should have played this role...but it means that Scarlett doesn't help Besson's efforts to fetishize her by being so dull.

Anyway, the movie does deliver a few modestly clever or exciting action sequences and it really moves fast.  I think it would have been a better movie if it had spent more time on action and less on the quacky ""science.""  Much of the scientific explanations are presented either in a very straightforward manner (Freeman lecturing in a classroom...wow, what a creative way to provide exposition!) or in a very trippy, TREE OF LIFE, ""artsy"" way that is so dumb, I'm not sure if Besson is serious or just poking fun at other movies that grapple with science.  It's certainly eye-rollingly inane.  All the pretention to art or philosophy or whatever are mere distractions from the solid action.  I wish it were easy to send this film back to the drawing board.  Cut most of the science and give some more complexity to Lucy's efforts to escape from and then defeat her tormentors.

I'd give the film 2.5 stars if I could.  2 stars for the good action stuff and 0.5 stars for the enjoyable international locations.",1409184000,,3138,4.6497277676951

6554000,2,B00M25EALG,"Okay. Horribly inaccurate science pushed aside, I have no idea what the hell this movie is even about. Is my brain just too ""unevolved"" to 'get' the ending?

The basic review is: Lucy is forced to be a drug mule in a foreign country and the drug bag accidentally bursts open inside her stomach, unlocking the other 90% of a human brain's potential. Apparently, when we use 100% of our brain's capacity, we become the universe itself... maybe??? I have no idea.

This movie is just about Lucy unlocking the rest of her brainpower and becoming less human, in the process. Because human brains are only good for information retaining and knowledge and all that good stuff. As Lucy ""unlocks"" more of her brainpower, she can do more things like control all of her body and organ functions (makes sense), unlock self telekinesis (somewhat makes sense... on a sci-fi level), control other people's bodily functions and will (makes less sense), re-organize matter on an atomic level (makes almost no sense) and... travel through time and space and become the Master of the Universe (mindf*ck territory). And that's basically it.

The rest of this is just a pseudo psy-fi (Get it? ""psy-fi"") flick that is often boring, and often more ridiculous than thought-provoking. Morgan Freeman is the smooth talking confidence man brought in to sell you on this premise by saying how ""dolphins use 20% of their brain potential and can develop sonar because of it."" Which is also unintentionally saying that dolphins are literally twice as intelligent, evolved, and god-like than humans are. So... yeah. I don't get it, either.

I think Luc Besson wanted to be ""deep and thought-provoking"" here, but one of the main problems is in that the science of the human brain ""only uses 10% of it's potential capacity"" isn't even accurate. In reality, if we used more than 10 to 20% of our brains at one time, we'd probably go into shock from sensory overload. Or possibly, insane. Or both. You don't remember things from your childhood, write music, learn a foreign language, type up a thesis, do calculus, and have a scientific debate all at the exact same time in any given situation, do you? Your car and computer have a lot of functions, too. How often do we use any of their hundreds of different functions all at once, thus using ""100% of your machine's potential""?

Also, in the most basic of scientific explanation, most of our brain functions and thoughts are reduced to simple electrical impulses traveling through our neurons in and around our brains and spinal cord. So at the *very least*, Lucy should have some kind of electrokinetic powers that allow her to ""control"" things around her via electrical impulses she admits out from her ""advanced"" brain. Because our thoughts are simply electricity in our brains. Even THAT would have made this movie more plausible. (And I'm not even any kind of neurosurgeon or psych major. This is basic stuff you can look up on Wikipedia.)

Plus, Scarlett Johansson isn't a very good actress in my honest opinion, but when playing dry characters that she can hide behind (like Black Widow), it becomes less obvious. Here, it's obvious. She's a boring, stiff, wooden actress, and it's HER, not her character, which helps make the movie even more boring and pseudo-science-y. There's little reason to care for Lucy pre-transformation, and post-transformation, she's an emotionless, god-like being who values knowledge and science as the end-all, be-all purpose of life in the universe. Which, even on an intellectual level, makes little sense. So knowing a lot of stuff is more important for human civilization and development than things like love, happiness, and self-fulfillment? (Which is also, ironically, which separates us from wild animals, to begin with.) If that's the case, humanity might as well be replaced by computers. But here, I guess ignorance really is bliss, then.

Worst of all, since Lucy basically becomes a god-like being with more unlocked brainpower, there really isn't much of an antagonist here, either. Some sloppy Asian mob boss is supposed to be a threat to a psychic goddess? What this means is, most of the action in the film is Lucy's remorseless rampage through Europe, killing innocent civilians because they're ""in her way"", while also giving the audience something less boring to look at when the bad guys aren't much of a threat to the god-like protagonist. I think Luc Besson liked this movie as a story idea, but just had no real direction for it. Or maybe he just got REALLY high one night and by the time he sobered up, had written this.

But yeah. Ridiculous science, confusing storyline about knowledge being the most important thing to leave behind for humanity, and a boring plot with no real threats or dangers, just leave you for a movie that you'd A) have to either be super-high to fully get or B) really dumb and pretending in order to seem smarter around your peers. Either way, if you like pseudo-science mixed up with pseudo-philosophy that might've vaguely been somewhat plausible in the mid 90's, ""Lucy"" is your kind of flick.",1408838400,4,5102,4.8969907407407405
6554001,5,B00M25EALG,"Luc Besson has done a masterful job of capturing the zeitgeist of the modern secular enlightenment movement, combined with  advanced physics, biochemistry, and a touch of Kurzweil singularity. I understand why many people do not get this movie. That is fine. I personally love this movie. It can be enjoyed as a summer thrill ride simply based upon the cinematography and acting. It can bring your appreciation to the next level if you are also a student of human consciousness. From that point of view, it is brilliantly executed! Just keep in mind that this movie is not intended to be a literal blueprint for evolving human consciousness, it is more of a hypothetical thought experiment based upon the concept that humans use much less than their full mental capacity.

Edited on 11-08-2014

The figure of 10% has attained the status of urban legend because it is so widely held, it is useful as a plot device in this movie, even though it is not literally true. It gives the characters an easy scale to use when they talk about her growth. The film maker only has 90 minutes or so to tell the story. Not enough time to dispel an urban legend and educate people on neurophysiology. If Luc Besson made one blunder, it might have been not realizing that more people are aware of the 10% figure being a myth than he thought. Keeping things in the realm of speculative fiction, I can imagine a few different scenarios where the drug would stimulate production of glial cells, neurons, axons, dendrites or even other factors that we have not become aware of yet.

I would have loved to see this done as a television series, where you could do justice to the material, but given that we only have the length of a movie, I really enjoyed it. (Because I am capable of filling in some of the blanks, you know, the way we used to do when we read books.)

6554002,1,B00M25EALG,"There is never a shortage of truly dire, pointless, specious, and dull movies - but apparently Luc Besson believes we need more in this genre so ""here's Lucy!""

Besson seems determined to prove the myth that humans only use 10% of their brains is actually true: he clearly used only a tiny fraction of his brain when he wrote what is easily the most flaccid, vacuous, and mind-numbingly stupid script imaginable. It's so atrociously dim-witted that it would insult the intelligence of a four-year-old, should any such child manage to remain awake through the course of this turgid, tedious production. The actors appear to feel the same way because they don't even dial in their performances. It's as if the movie was shot using animation based on stills Besson stole from other movie advertisements. And this is understandable because the dialog is so pathetically lame that it makes ""let's head them off at the pass"" seem like sparkling wit in comparison.

There is, in fact, absolutely no reason to waste a couple of hours of your life watching this intellectually stunted, pseudo-philosophical nonsense. If you fed an African snail lots of cocaine and alcohol until its central nervous system was jelly, it might just (maybe...) come up with something as stupid and trite as this ridiculous movie.

6554005,3,B00M25EALG,"Hi. My name is thornhill and Im a Luc Besson film junkie.

Hi, thornhill.

Its been two days since my last Besson film My addiction was created when I first saw The Professional, a strange, violent, highly orchestrated film about a professional hitman (Jean Reno) protecting a little girl (Natalie Portman) who witnesses a murder. It was and is a very different film from most other Hollywood action films. The violence is more extreme, the acting is both broader and more refined in some ways, the story is more interesting and involving, it also has a distinctly European flavor. With The Professional I became hooked on the directors films

And throughout the years, Bessons work has become more and more like the Hollywood studio work that so clearly influenced him in the early days making the films less interesting and less exciting. But there is still, usually, a handful of elements that helps to make his work better than your typical Hollywood action film. His work lately has been more hit and miss  he seems to be as enamored of sequels as your typical Hollywood producer, cranking them through the machine just to generate more money. As a producer, writer and/ or director, he has worked on an incredible number of film and television projects before handing them off to someone else and letting them take the reins. Taken 3 is coming soon, based on a screenplay he created. Transporter 4, 5 and 6 are all in the works, as well as a television version, based on his idea and screenplays for the first few films. When it comes to the actual films he writes, produces and directs, they are a bit more spotty of late.

Did you know that humans typically use about 10% of the capacity of their brain? Dolphins use about 20% which is how they were able to develop the sonar they use. This is the beginning of the conversation providing the framework for Lucy, Bessons newest film starring Scarlett Johannson.

Three things happen almost concurrently throughout the first half of the film. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), an expert in neurolinguistics, gives a lecture to a rapturous audience at a university in Paris, providing the framework for the first half of the film. He talks about what might happen if a human were able to use 10%, 20%, more of their potential brain power. These moments are cut into the story of Lucy, a young American student living in Taiwan who appears to be using about 5% of her potential brain power when she starts dating Richard (Pilou Asbaek), the type of guy who you look at and know he is involved in some bad stuff. They are standing outside of a luxury hotel; Richard wants Lucy to take the briefcase he is holding to the front desk and deliver it to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). She doesnt want to, she has to get ready for school on Monday. He handcuffs the briefcase to her wrist and forces her to go inside. Things go very wrong and Mr. Jang decides Lucy will be one of four couriers to bring a bag of a new, very potent drug back to their homelands. They will, of course, have the bags surgically implanted in their stomachs. Lucy wakes up and notices the sutures on her stomach, then she wakes up again in a jail cell. Her captors kick her around a bit, causing the bag to leak and start to affect her brain. Thus begins the countdown. As Lucys brain achieves a new level of functionality, that percentage appears on screen. Strangely, Besson also cuts in a lot of nature shots of animals mating, hunting, killing, etc. This is Bessons way of creating an almost subliminal montage reinforcing the messages Norman discusses with his seminar participants. These three elements, intertwined for the first forty or so minutes, create an unusual, but interesting narrative which holds your attention.

This is the second film dealing with similar subject matter I have seen in three months. In Transcendence, Johnny Depp plays a scientist developing an artificial intelligence computer. He is physically hooked up to the computer and uses the knowledge of the computer and the internet to begin to control his environment. Basically, because he has no body to hinder him, he is able to use all of his energy to gain knowledge, to gain control, to gain power. Lucy follows a similar idea; unleashing the brains full potential. And both films have flaws leading them to shut down faster than you can press and hold the power button on your computer.

At 10%, Lucy is a typical, not very intelligent college student living in a foreign country because they have the freedom to party and party some more. Her boyfriend Richard pressures her to do something that puts her on a new course, putting her in the sights of some very dangerous men. After an altercation, the drug allows her to begin using 20% of her brain power. Watching her make this realization and use this new, expanded brain capacity is fun. She quickly breaks out of her captors environment and tries to set things right  she visits another American friend to use her computer and read all the research Professor Norman has ever written before contacting him.

When Lucy gets to about 50% capacity, Besson begins to explore territory that he doesnt sufficiently (if at all) ground in the narrative and Lucys quest begins to fall apart. At one point, Lucy teams up with a French cop (Amr Wakeed) who hesitantly accepts she has some unique powers when he sees her levitate a group of men to the ceiling, each of the big guys struggling to get down. When they are about to have a huge showdown with a bunch of criminals, Lucy asks him if he and the police can hold the gangsters off, so she can concentrate on her next task. Lucy is, by this point, using a very high percentage of her brain power. If, as Norman has explained, she can control many things, why cant she hold the men off and complete her task? Just a few moments earlier, she disabled an entire group of gangsters simply by waving her hand. Holding off a new bunch of bad guys shouldnt be that tasking. Not to mention that in leaving the safety of these people to the cops, she is putting innocent people in harms way. It is an example of an action that doesnt appear to be completely thought out. Is this going to be the new sci-fi genre that replaces Time Travel as the genre with the most discussed inconsistencies? Will the abilities of neurocomputers replace discussions about causing a time rift when you meet yourself in the past or future?

So, there are problems with the science of Lucy. But there are also problems with the narrative of the film. After Lucy has the surgery, she wakes up in a luxury hotel room moments before Mr. Jangs men grab her and force her to line- up with the three other mules. Moments later, she wakes up, alone, in a jail cell surrounded by a new group of Taiwanese men. Huh? How did she end up in a jail cell? Why? If Mr. Jang is the fearsome man he is  and he is, there is plenty of evidence  how did someone else capture Lucy and put her in a jail cell? If it is Jangs men who captured her, why? You would think he would want her to get to her destination as quickly as possible, so he could retrieve the drugs and get his men selling them. Once she does break out, using her increased brain capacity, you begin to get an idea of what is in store for Lucy and our journey with her  her mind is working at a different level than ours, she can see, hear, feel things we cant.

For the ninety minutes of the film, we get maybe ten when Johannson is actually able to create a character. She isn't that likable, because she appears dumb and way too concerned with partying but this is fine  not every character has to be likable - but she doesnt really grow or evolve into anything else. As soon as the drugs are implanted, Lucy becomes a hybrid-ized warrior and in Bessons eyes, this must mean she has to also become emotionless. Throughout, she simply stares into the horizon (looking at all of the streams of data she is now able to see) and speaks in a monotone. It is difficult to feel anything for her because she appears to be a bit of a robot.

Morgan Freeman does the wise-sage role he should really copyright because he has played it so many times. In fact, he was also in Transcendence playing more or less the same character. Lucy forces him to quickly accept what she has to say  Besson never messes around with his narratives, if he says something is true, its true. Late in the film, when he finally meets Lucy face to face, he seems to stare at her in awe, watching her mind work. When did he lose all of the scientific skepticism he has built up for his entire career?

Besson has a lot of fun with Mr. Jang. As soon as Lucy enters his hotel room, we see visual clues to the level of his ruthlessness. Min-sik Choi has a lot of fun playing the evil, determined crime boss, infuriated more because a young American girl is getting the better of him.

Lucy is a film with a lot of unique visuals and some good action scenes, but the narrative cant support it and ultimately falls apart.

6554008,2,B00M25EALG,"Luc Besson is a master of full-auto violence, a choreographer of bullet-ridden ballets. He's at his best telling relatively simple stories about emotionally handicapped protagonists who have been transformed into weapons, finally reconnecting with their lost humanity, but killing hundreds of people in the process. 'The Professional' and 'La Femme Nikita' were classics of completely ridiculous violence, but this foray into the science fiction genre is just ridiculous.

'Lucy' is not a convoluted mess, as bad science fiction sometimes tends to be, but no amount of gunshots and car crashes can distract the viewer enough to accept the pseudo-scientific laziness of the plot. Idea's regarding how much of the human brain we actually 'use' are theoretical; claiming that access to untapped regions will result in superpowers or a godlike mastery of space-time is hard to accept. It's just as likely that those 'untapped' regions have functions that are entirely banal, and that 'over-clocking' the brain will cause seizures, strokes, death... Still, I don't believe in demons or devils, but I loved 'The Exorcist'. The problem isn't 'bad' science -- this is science fiction, after all -- it's bad writing. It's also familiar, an idea that has been explored without all the stats and silliness. It's basically the same premise that Katsuhiro Otomo used in 'Akira', but that film did everything right, while 'Lucy' is just looking for interesting new ways to kill the bad guys. It's not terrible, but it's unoriginal and thoroughly mediocre.

It starts well, as the globe-trotting party-girl 'Lucy' (a reference to... oh, who cares?) is forced by a shady acquaintance to deliver a briefcase to vicious gangsters. This is the kind of thing Besson excels at, and he manages to make things suspenseful as the situation gets worse for Lucy. She is kidnapped, knocked out, surgically implanted with a mysterious bag of drugs, and then forced to act as a 'mule'. While she waits, one of her captors attacks her, rupturing the package and releasing the experimental drug into her system. About 10 minutes after her 'awakening', things go horribly awry... for the film. I've seen this idea executed better on cheesy, low-budget TV series. I find it kind of sad that a movie about almost limitless human potential aims so low and accomplishes so little.

Scarlett Johansson is one of the most talented and intriguing actresses in Hollywood, but she ends up playing the second half of the film with a toneless inflection and dead-eyed roboticism that is meant to suggest the shedding of emotional skin as she approaches an omniscient objectivity. Morgan Freeman, who is an Oscar-winning actor, has become the go-to-guy for establishing credibility and selling crazy concepts. In 'Lucy', he's essentially a narrator posing as a character, 'playing' a professor of bulls*** who provides helpful reminders of what to expect as Lucy works her way up to 100%. Besson cuts back and forth, from Lucy's rampage to the lecture hall, as '20%' and '40%' are projected on the screen for Freeman's presentation. He makes ludicrously specific claims about what to expect, despite the fact that there have been no studies to back up any of it. His proof is limited to the example of the dolphin, who (he claims) uses 20% of it's brain, twice what human's use. That 10% allowed them to develop echo-location more accurate than sonar... or the evolutionary development of sonar required another 10%. Either way, fascinating as it might be (or fictional), it's a big leap between a dolphin with echo-location and Scarlett Johansson as Master of the Universe. Science fiction doesn't have to be backed up by hard data, it just has to be convincing. {62/100}",1408233600,,3728,5.108196721311476

6554011,4,B00M25EALG,"This review may contain inadvertent plot spoilers.

I love science fiction when the emphasis is on science. If you love hype, special effects, gadgets, and a slightly different plot, this one has all of that. However, I have a hard time grasping the concept that special abilities such as manipulating time, space and dimension will happen when a person uses more of their brain.

These type of films, of people who suddenly acquire special abilities is not new. The film gave me flashbacks of ""The Man with the X-Ray Eyes,"" ""Limitless"" ""Transcendence"", ""The Time Machine"" and ""2001..."" just to name a few. There are more.

Lucy is given an experimental drug, CPH-4 that erupts in her abdomen and if you have seen one preview for the film, you know pretty much the whole film and have a good idea where it goes save the details.

PLOT SPOILER: The scene that ties the film together is when she is back in time and meets our ancestor, a man-ape which reminds us of Dr. Leaky's ""Lucy."" Here, as in the painting of the Sistine Chapter our Lucy extends her finger, like God, to touch the finger of the man-ape. It was as if they created the whole film for this one scene. This of course is an expression of the New Age concept of a universal mind.

Unfortunately, the ending dragged on a bit, like a man entering a monolith. I was hoping for more face to face ""Kill Bill"" type action. And what was that face melting acid airplane scene?

Too much fantasy for my tastes. Looks good on the big scene. 3 1/2 stars

Nothing in this pathetic accuse of action movie made any sense. There wasn't a single good thing I can find in this garbage, not even Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson can save this messy movie. The movie constantly jump to some sort of artistic scene, something you would see in like a Wes Anderson, or Ang Lee movie. It was really annoying horribly disjointed. Lucy gets powers cause some sort of drug that in her stomach. But the doesn't explain how the hell she able to do these things. This garbage pretty much borrows elements from far superior movies, like the Limitless, and Chronicle. It's like those 2 movie combined into Lucy, But those movies were more fun, better acted, and more focused than this mess. When this movie was over I looked at my sister and parents and said this

6554014,1,B00M25EALG,"This film reminded me of Limitless, as I'm sure most of those who've seen it would agree.  For those who haven't seen Limitless, it is a film based on Eddie Morra, portrayed by Bradley Copper, and his experiment with a drug that allows him to access a greater percentage of the brain, which allowed him to access memory banks, learn new languages at a miraculous rate, etc. All in all, it was a bad film that lacked any semblance of a twist and or surprise.  Lucy was almost exactly like Limitless, except in Lucy, she did fantastical things, like control energy, electricity, and yes even people.  Movie started off interesting and ended up taking an odd turn and just got awkwardly bad.  She eventually *spoiler alert* turns into a computer and ultimately a USB drive full of priceless data and information, but more precisely technology was what she became.

Lucy was a film that yielded an interesting concept, but unfortunately lacked execution and like Limitless, lacked an intriguing plot of any sort.  I do not recommend anybody watching this film.",1407715200,17,1056,4.838888888888889
6554015,3,B00M25EALG,"This movie was such a mixed bag.  I loved Luc Besson's previous films, and he has some great ideas in Lucy.  The first half of the movie works very well - Scarlett Johansson is very convincing as she goes from terrified college student to superbeing; there are quite a few funny scenes; and, the science is at least somewhat sound.  From there, the movie's momentum fizzles out.  When Lucy becomes emotionless and all-powerful (the bad guys have ZERO chance of besting her), the suspense goes out the window.  The ending is anticlimactic, not to mention extremely farfetched.  Sure, it's science fiction, but scifi has to be based on at least some facts.  I can buy into enhanced senses and reflexes, complete metabolic control, and even mind control - but re-arranging atoms and time travel with your mind?  Now we're getting in to magic.

The movie does score some points.  I like the idea that as Lucy becomes more omnipotent, she rises above all the pettiness that bogs down the human race.  Besson could have made this a simple action film, with Lucy using her newfound abilities to cut a bloody swathe through her enemies.  Instead, he chose to take the enlightened approach.  With the secrets of the universe now clear to her, Lucy passes on her knowledge for the human race to do with as it will for good or ill, and then she transcends.  I like this ending in that it gives hope for humans to be better than what they are.  Luc Besson was very ambitious to take on this theme.

There were many parts of this movie that caused us to scratch our heads.  At times, it made us feel like we were watching one of the Matrix movies, with the defiance of gravity, telekinesis and action sequences. Then there were these odd injections of sequences that I can only explain as feeling like we were watching a National Geographic documentary.  Animals hunting other animals, animals procreating, and other odd scenes that are not actually part of the storyline.  I realize the director added those to try to emphasize the message at the time, but it felt out of place to us as we didn't need those scenes to understand the situation these scenes were trying to emphasize.  They were more of a distraction and made the flow of the movie a little disjointed.  The role of the police officer seemed to be just a temporary side-kick and didn't really add much value.  It wouldn't have changed the story line if that character was removed from the movie altogether  The movie felt like it ended abruptly.  The ending was building in intensity and then seemed to end like a punch-line to a joke.  The credits were rolling before we could absorb why the movie ended the way it did.  We both really like Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman...we both felt these roles did not really play to their strengths and there didn't seem to be that much chemistry between the two of them since they were only in a few minutes of simultaneous screen time.  Lucy felt more robotic as her brain function increased and less like someone who was becoming super-human.  We really wanted to like this movie.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't our cup of tea.

In the storyline, our heroine hooks up with the wrong guy, who forces her to deliver a package to some real bad drug dealers.  As events unfold, while she is trying to stay alive, a synthetic substance winds up going viral through her blood and she developes an unbelievable mind expansiveness (as you have already seen in the promo).  This expansiveness allows her to use well beyond the normal 10% of her brain.  The extended mind enhancement allows Lucy to do extraordinary things, as you would probably expect.  It is an intreging concept on the capabilities of the human mind and its ability to affect all matter and energy forms.

I thought the movie well worth a watch.  On the down side, they could have done more by expanding Lucy's capabilities just a wee bit more.  Morgan Freeman was great as a top scientist in his field--the exploration of the potential of the human mind.",1407369600,,979,4.7514792899408285

Where Limitless had great acting on behalf of Bradley Cooper, Scarlett Johansson gives a lackluster performance in Lucy.

6554026,4,B00M25EALG,"""Lucy"" (2014 release from France;; 94 min.) brings the story of Lucy (played by Scarlett Johansson). As the movie opens, we see Lucy being scammed into making a delivery to some bad guys in Taipei. Things go south quickly and before we know it, Lucy and 3 others are forced to become a drug mule. Lucy is inadvertently taking in some of the synthetic CPH 4 drug, and soon thereafter her senses are beginning to increase and her cerebral capacity goes up. In a parallel story, we get to know Prof. Norman (played by Morgan Freeman), who has been studying the human brain's capabilities for 20 years. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest action movie from French writer-director Luc Besson, who previously has treated us to ""Nikita"" and ""The Transporter"", among many, many others. The difference here is that he has been given a very large budget (for European standards--the number I read was around $60 million), and he sure puts it to good use. From the get-go, there is almost non-stop action, be it in Taipei or in Paris, the 2 main locations of the movie. Second, it's Scarlett! This is the latest in a long string of recent roles, starting with ""Don Johnson"" last year, and then ""Under the Skin"" and most recently ""Chef"" (she also starred in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but I didn't see that movie). All roles one better than the next. You can just tell that she enjoys being the ass-kicking girl who's not going to be denied. At one point Lucy comments: ""I don't feel pain, fear, desire"" and instead she just kicks butt. Third, did I mention there is quasi non-stop action in the movie? The car chase scene in central Paris is the best such sequence in a long, long time. Last but not least, there is a very nice electronica soundtrack, composed by Eric Serra. Over the end titles we also get a great new song from Damon Albarn, ""Sister Rust"".

""Lucy"" is becoming one of the most unexpected surprises at this summer's box office, and it's easy to see why: decent story line, lots of action, and a killer leading lady. What more can you ask for? The matinee screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was very well attended, keeping in mind that this is the 2nd weekend that it's playing in theaters. There is already talk of a possible sequel (of course!). Bottom line, I most often go see foreign and indie movies, but once in a while, I dig a well-made mainstream action movie, and this one delivered from start to finish.

Imagine yourself suddenly able to see all, hear all, feel all, do all.....and know that you are coming apart literally.  Check your high expectations for truth and fact at the door.  See this movie for the sheer pleasure of entertainment.",1406851200,190,591,4.6
6554031,4,B00M25EALG,"This R-rated action/thriller reminded me once again that writer/director Luc Besson (""The Family"") is the French Martin Scorsese, with characters ""popped"" (shot) without compunction, people stabbed unexpectedly and beaten mercilessly, but his complex plot is laid out with crystal clarity.

The film switches back and forth between college student Lucy, as she is thrust into a terrifyingly lethal situation, and an anthropology lecture which provides us with the background that enables us to follow the story. We soon find ourselves questioning the nature of knowledge.

We watch:
  * Scarlett Johansson (""The Avengers"") is our eponymous heroine, tricked into a shady deal, brutalized, and inadvertently turned into a lab experiment.
  * Morgan Freeman (""Last Vegas"") plays a professor of anthropology who speculates about the mind-boggling potential of a human able to use 100% of its brain.
  * Amr Waked (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") is the gendarme Lucy keeps around as ""a reminder.""
  * Min-sik Choi (""Oldboy"" 2003) is a gangster who has seen the prodigious profits that might be possible from a synthetic compound that could change human nature.
  * Julian Rhind-Tutt (""Notting Hill"") is the obsequious facilitator who instructs the drug ""mules"" as they are forced to smuggle the compound to three major cities.

In my opinion, the eye-popping special effects were a bit overdone (but I always say that, don't I?), and I would have been happy if we had stopped when she had achieved only 80% of her potential, but based on the size of the screening crowd which had to be shoe-horned into the theater, this exciting, involving film should do very, very well.",1406851200,10,1667,5.175373134328358
6554032,1,B00M25EALG,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen ""This Is The End"", so what does that tell you?).  I can get past the untrue and ridiculous premise.  I can even get past Morgan Freeman's poorly fitting dentures.  But I can't forgive the holes in the plot, the stereotypical characters, and the sheer nonsense of the scene where several police cars come careening up to a hospital, sirens blaring, and officers rush in, apparently not noticing that, just a few feet away, there is an entire ROW of black cars with men in black suits taking automatic weapons, bazookas and rocket launchers out of the trunks.  Seriously?  The mockery of DaVinci's sublime ""Creation of Adam"", the weird black goo, SJ convulsing on the ceiling, the stupid and pointless car chases, the fingers flying on a keyboard so fast no computer could keep up, it's all too much for one human mind to take--no matter how much of it is being used at that particular time.  This movie made me wish I could have shut 100% of my higher brain functions off for the duration.  This is my first ever movie review--that's how bad this movie is.  Please, save your money, donate it to charity, or at the very least, Redbox this disaster.",1406851200,13,1210,4.595348837209302
6554033,5,B00M25EALG,"Just saw Lucy, the new Luc Besson film starring Scarlett Johansson, and loved it! Lucy received tepid reviews proving once again that the people who are paid to review movies live on a different planet than I do. Besson has a talent for creating fast-paced yet quirky films with lots of well-staged and crisply-edited action. (I am especially fond of The Professional.) Lucy moves like lightning and its 88 minutes seemed longer but only because it was so exciting. Some reviewers seem disappointed that it was not more cerebral. They are missing the point. Lucy is great entertainment, period. Given what has been coming out of Hollywood of late, that is good enough for me. Johansson is terrific as a woman who achieves 100 percent use of her brain. The supporting cast is perfect, ranging from Asian baddies who are very bad to the French police who are very French. Script and direction are excellent. Forgive me, but I love Lucy!",1406764800,10,934,4.807453416149069
6554034,1,B00M25EALG,"One of the biggest, longest myths about the human brain, is that we use only 10% of it.

This is an absolute lie. It's a lie that has annoyed educated people for a long time.

A google search will corroborate this.

A movie like this, that spreads false scientific information to so many people - using Morgan Freeman's narrative to make it sound even more believable - automatically deserves 1 star.

I think it's ironic that a movie about someone becoming super smart will actually be responsible for causing so many people to decline just one little step further in intelligence.",1406764800,11,582,4.732673267326732
6554035,2,B00M25EALG,"The first two-thirds of this movie was smart, well done and provocative, but then the logic of the plot began to unravel and got its tail caught in its own incredulity.

Why is that when screenwriters get to this point, they invariably turn to pyrotechnics: car chases, screeching car wrecks, and gun-blazing bloody homicides -- even though those things usually have nothing at all to do with the logic of the plot or the continuity of the main story line?

Maybe they think that if they ""tack"" those thing on, the average moviegoer will be too stupid to see the disconnect? Or maybe they do it because that is what sells tickets. Either way, it surely reduces the value of U.S. cinematographic art. Two-thirds of Two Stars.",1406678400,5,724,4.692913385826771
6554036,5,B00M25EALG,"Luc Bessons Lucy is an unexpected and thought-provoking exercise in What-If science fiction, masquerading as a summer action blockbuster.  Despite some maddening flaws, it presents a powerful and compelling vision of what evolution, enlightenment, and eventual human ascension might look like.

The story revolves around Lucy, a ditzy 20-something blond party girl living the high life in Taipei, played by Scarlett Johansson.  She becomes an accidental drug mule for some really scary bad guys who load up her abdomen with a new, super-duper synthetic party drug she must transport out of the country.  Thanks to more really scary post-surgery bad guys, the drug starts leaking into Lucys gut, launching a chain of biochemical events that gradually turn on Lucys brain capacity to the 100% mark over the course of the film.  Morgan Freeman plays the eminent brain researcher/Greek Chorus who helps Lucy, explains all the high-tech stuff to the rest of us, and dodges bullets when Lucy supernaturally conquers the bad guys who come to get their drug back.  News Flash: The bad guys cant touch her.  At all.

The film has several strong points.  Besson is a great proficient in high visual style as seen in his earlier films The 5th Element and la Femme Nikita. The look of the film is beautiful, and its all very well paced.  Besson and his writers knew enough to not let either the action scenes or the more serious stuff fall into clich.  Animation wonderfully evokes, among other things, the life processes in our cells, passing through black holes, and also allows us to meet the original 3.2 million year old Lucy, the first near-modern primate ever discovered in the fossil record.

Viewers are naturally much more interested in the modern Lucy, and the film does not disappoint on that score.  Scarlett Johansson does a superb job of being lofty, otherworldly, poignant, and a bombshell in a little black Chanel dress and 6-inch Christian Louboutin heels.  The French filmmakers thought, somehow, that if you're going to evolve and ascend, you should dress well enough to get through the metaphysical door.  In the hands of a lesser actress, this would come off as either really campy or patronizing.  Gifted actress that she is, Johansson brings a solemn nobility and innocent fascination to her character that is impossible to laugh at.  She manages to maintain her dignity while fighting bad guys with really big guns, and driving insanely against one-way traffic in Paris, all the while obviously preoccupied with much larger, more interesting things than what those silly people are doing around her.  Morgan Freeman is an excellent foil, bringing warmth and credibility to a part that amounts to reading a neurology textbook out loud.  He carries it all off with complete artistic conviction.

This reviewer is most grateful that, despite the summer action movie packaging, the message is surprisingly high-toned.  The small details and moments in the film show this to best advantage.  As her plane lands in Paris, Lucy raises a glass of very good champagne to thin air and toasts,To Knowledge!  Its a small but telling moment.  This is how Lucy will proceed with her evolution.  The old adage remains true for many people that ultimate power corrupts absolutely.  Just not here, and not with Lucy.  Shes going to arrive at enlightenment in the best way possible.  Many plot points in the movie support this upward path.

A few things tend to water down the message, however.  First, the film is way too short at 1 hour 28 minutes.  The most interesting points of the philosophical discussion get glossed over, or left hanging.  For example, in the middle of the death-dealing demolition derby car chase in Paris, Lucy turns to her anxious policeman sidekick and reassures him with We never really die, while avoiding a lethal crash is if by mere chance.  Now, it would have been quite interesting if Lucy could have discussed the after-life a bit more, since it seems like she actually knows something about it.  Besson must have decided most unfortunately that the car chase had to come first.  Interesting and even mind-blowing points are maddeningly rushed over in this way.

Also, much of the 1st act exposition is handled like a comic or graphic novel, and so the 1st act plot is overly compressed.  Thus, much of the character development ends up a little shallow.  It would have helped, for one thing, to see Lucy as she had been in a bit more detail before undergoing her drug-induced brain explosion.  As it is, its hard to tell if she changes much, or not at all.  10 or 20 more screen minutes would have solved both these problems easily and not burdened the film at all.

But having said that, the film succeeds in posing a lot of mind-blowing questions in an arresting way.  Is this what enlightenment really is?  Is this where evolution is actually taking us?  All those big questions and high-toned ethics, plus a bunch of guns and a little black dress, tied up in a summer action flick.  Who knew?",1406678400,596,5028,4.884297520661157
6554037,3,B00M25EALG,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Lucy"" [France, 2014]

1. This movie is equal parts style and stupidity. Its fun to watch, but it requires you to power down your brain. Which is ironic, given the subject of the movie.

2. Its based on the urban legend that humans only use 10% of their brains. Of course, thats not true, but it doesnt stop writer-director Luc Besson from using it as the main idea. Besson proves once again that hes better at action than storytelling.

3. Its about a young woman named Lucy who accidentally gets forced into being a mule for a synthetic superdrug. When she gets beaten, the drug leaks into her system, it boosts her brainpower, and she becomes magical.

4. The movie is pretty interesting and suspenseful for the first half-hour. Then Lucy becomes indestructible, so all the intensity leaks away. Theres nothing to do except watch Scarlett Johansson kick ass. And apparently the smartest, most god-like woman in the world still likes wearing sexy high heels all the time.

5. The movie makes less and less sense the farther in you get. There are more plot holes in the script than there are neurons in the brain. But it looks cooler and cooler, so theres that. The ending of the movie is both trippy and ridiculous. Everything comes so unhinged that you have to just roll with it..

6. Morgan Freeman, who is excellent at narrating real science shows on TV, had to be wincing as he said some of his lines, which were so stupid that no brain scientist would ever actually even think them.

7. Every now and then, the movie tries to sneak in a bit of real philosophy. But its surrounded by so much lunacy that any actual wisdom the movie tries to impart is quickly lost - or contradicted.

8. Scarlett Johansson absolutely makes the movie. Shes in almost every scene, and she single-handedly holds the movie together with the force of her own personality.

9. I predict this movie will become a new weed classic. Watching it stoned will increase the films trippiness, and make you think the movie is actually deep, which will spark many memorable conversations.",1406678400,9,2089,4.654891304347826
6554038,2,B00M25EALG,"Start with a premise pretty well debunked by science: people use only 10% of their ""cerebral capacity."" Massive dose of mysterious drug unlocks the other 90%, I'll go that far with you. But how that gives Johansson a flattened affect to rival Keanu Reeves, how it gives her all those mysterious abilities, well that all got to be just a bit much. Then the un-ending - was it sequel-bait? Writers got tired? Budget ran out? We may never know.

Besson has done some very good films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element/dp/B000S6BKSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element</a>&nbsp;among them. Regrettably I do not add this to his list of good ones. Or Johansson's.
