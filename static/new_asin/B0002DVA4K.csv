8027078,5,B0002DVA4K,"It is impressive to say the least to see this man call his shots at ranges up to 600 yards. His presentation is informative and easy to follow. The most interesting part is toward the end of the 2nd CD when he illustrates his sight picture at different ranges. After viewing it, I have made changes accordingly at the range.",1283731200,,324,4.416666666666667
