Not only does it have a wonderful and talented cast, it also has absolutely breathtaking scenery to help fill out the clear and well written story line. A must have for any Christopher Eccleston fans as he is just phenomenal in this show.",1462320000,,382,4.2465753424657535
8703002,3,B00TSCI7NI,"Safe House is an okay mini series British TV show, all up the episodes go for around three hours, but there's pretty lengthy opening credits  with previously on Safe House summaries, as well as credits at the end of each episode so you can fast forward and save yourself about twenty minutes.  I don't understand why they don't edit these shows when they put them on DVD for the Play All option, just have all the credits at the end of the final episode, get rid of the previously on stuff, then it would be just like viewing a double your standard movie length film.

This is a family suddenly targeted for some unknown reason to all of them (or is it?) who narrowly avoid their son being kidnapped in a violent attempt where an innocent good samaritan who steps in is murdered. Meanwhile a former detective has quit the force after being shot, and relocated to run a bed and breakfast type place in an isolated rural mountainy (by England's standards) place on a lake.  His former boss has picked up the kidnapping case and since the father of the potential abductee is a prison guard, asks the former detective if he wouldn't mind making his yet to open Bed and Breakfast a safe-house for this family.  Of course the former detective agrees.

This is one of those shows where the most interesting character is the bad guy. A man determined to get to the family who is not against leaving a trail of bodies behind, which he did what he could to get information out of before he killed them.  Mild spoilers follow - the show does the standard witness protection weakness by the teenage girl doing the cliche teenage girl thing of I've really got to talk to my boyfriend, even though I've been told not to use a phone or contact anyone.  There's also a few unrealistic things that happen to conveniently push along the plot such as someone getting mugged but within half an hour the boss policeman knows about it when in reality the incident probably wouldn't have been reported at all to anyone but the phone company.  Likewise the bad guy kills someone, then closes the front door, yet the body is found pretty much straight away when it should have only been discovered when neighbours complained about the smell.  We also have a constantly visited truck stop that never has any trucks stopping at it.

I found in the first episodes when we had a lot of side face shots of either the safe house guy or the bad guy looking out a window it being difficult to tell who was who until the scene played out being they both have the same three day stubble look.  I also found the initial attempted abduction scene to be  a bit unrealistic, the kid doesn't kick out, or fight against his abductor in any way, just gets carried a long way like a surfboard under his arm.",1461456000,2,2764,4.47117296222664
