Easy to fallow, intensive, and set up well.  Easy to do  along with the tape. Not a lot of space required (great for small  apartments) and no special apparatus needed!

394983,5,6301966244,"(Re-rated considering the DVD edition; i originally rated the significantly-shorter VHS edition 3 stars.)

Once upon a simpler time, Sergio Leone set out to make a trilogy of films that would be thematically related -- the ""Once Upon a Time"" films; many people aren't aware of this, even if they know Leone's  work.

This film (according to usually-reliable sources), shot under the  working title ""Once Upon a Time -- The Revolution"", was the  second of the three (between ""...in the West"" and ""...in  America"".

While it mostly eschews the heavier-handed Messages of  the other two, still not everything in this film is on the surface -- there  is subtext in the relationship between the Mexican peasant bankrobber and  the fugitive Irish explosives expert.

Rod Steiger (in my second-favourite  of his roles) as Juan, the apolitical bank robber drawn into the Mexican  Revolution very much against his better judgement and James Coburn,  travelling through Mexico by motorcycle carrying enough dynamite under his  long duster to redraw the maps if he's shot, both appear to have had a ball  making this film.

In the elliptical way that Leone often approaches  things, this film is the story of the redemption of a man who has given up  on himself -- the cynical Irish fugitive begins to realise that, despite  his claim that ""...in the end, all I believe in is dynamite"", he  DOES care what happens to ""the little people"" and that he is  willing to fight and die for them.  And it is the story of the  radicalisation of a non-political non-intellectual as he is forced to see,  first-hand, the abuses of the system and the casual mistreatment of the  common man that he has managed to avoid looking at so far.

And it ends  with the question that everyone who actually thinks must ask, if only  rhetorically, when others can no longer guide and protect us and we must  fly or fall, sink or swim on our own merits.. -- ""But what about  me?""

And, as always, Leone's masterful protrayal of confrontation  and violence, physical and moral, is evident -- particularly the scene in  which the bandit and the Irishman set out on their own to stop an armoured  cavalry column that is pursuing the fleeing revolutionaries, or the  confrontation on a locomotive loaded with explosives between the Irishman  and a leader of the Revolution who (known only to the Irishman) has cracked  under pressure and caused the deaths of men from his cadre...

The  Morricone score, of course, is wonderful -- particularly the sly little  quotes from ""A Little Night Music"" in the middle of something  else entirely.",952300800,12,2597,4.835616438356165
394984,4,6301966244,"Although not quite as good as Once Upon A Time In The West and The Good The Bad and the Ugly, this is still a masterpiece and remains Italian cinema's best depiction of the Mexican revolution.  Leone's landscape  panoramas and his unrivalled close-ups, Morricone's fantasic music (his  score is right-up there with his all time best - buy the CD) and great,  larger than life performances by Steiger and Coburn contribute to the fun.  ""Where there's revolution, there's confusion.  And where there's  confusion a man who knows what he wants stand a good chance of getting  it"".
My favourites - the scene in which Coburn watches the execution  of the revolutionaries intercut with a flashback of killing his best friend  (played by Lucio Fulci horror star David Warbeck) in Ireland and the scene  in which Steiger robs the bank opening door after door to find  revolutionaries instead of money to the accompanyment of a Morricone tune  steadily building in crescendo.
But this is the cut PG rated version and  is also pan and scanned - the uncut version, which is about 17 minutes  longer, was released on laserdisc a couple of years ago and surely DVD is  crying out for a widescreen, uncut release.  Where is it ?",951696000,16,1214,4.759615384615385
394985,5,6301966244,"This movie has been one of my favorites for years. James Coburn and Rod Steiger are great in their roles, expecially Steiger. The story about a Mexican bandit who's drawn unwilingly into a revolution by an Irish  explosive expert combines both superb action scenes, great drama, humor and  also has a brilliant score by Ennio Morricone.

I like James Coburn a lot, but Rod Steiger really is amazing. Just his bizarre take on a Mexican accent would make this movie worth watching, but the plot, action and acting are way more than you would expect. It's kind of a riff on Fistfull of Dollars (the original title was Fistfull of Dynamite) and you can see a lot of parallels. But it goes way out there by the end.

395165,5,6301966244,"I remember it coming out in 1972 and seeing it in a drive in. At the time I thought, ""Another Spaghetti Western"". I got another chance to see this on cable TV last month. Seeing it with older eyes, it struck me as being much deeper (more developed) as the Western I saw so many years ago. I loved the other Westerns that Sergio Leone produced. This particular movie had orchestrated scenes that logistically wouldn't be done in today's terms. This film was crafted. This film has subtle humor. It also has a nice dark side.

I took the time to do a little research about this film and after some review, decided to order my own copy. This Blu-ray version has all the 'extras' that the DVD version had. That was nice to hear the commentary and scene locations -- then and now.

In all, a worthy addition to my movie collection.",1473033600,,826,4.392156862745098

396078,3,6301966244,"This movie is disappointing because of what it obviously could have been.  Obvious because even as you watch there are certain elements that really bug you and leave feeling there must be some mistake.  Specifically----

Rod Steiger is wrong for the role.  Within the first few lines of dialog ask ""where is Eli Wallach?""  My almost immediate reaction was that the dialoc of ""Juan"" was written expressly for Wallach.  In my mind I kept hearing the same lines as the would sound delivered by Wallach as ""Tuco"".  After watching I consulted the Wikipedia and discovered that was Leone's intent.  Steiger is a great actor but this is not the role for him.  This is the biggest disappointment and the absence of Wallach accounts for one entire star in my rating of this film.  A real production tragedy.

The same Wikipedia article says that Eastwood was preferred foe ""Sean"", but Coburn seems to be to be just as good if not a tad better.  I wish, however, he had worked a little more with his dialect coach as the Irish accent seems to slip away from him occasionally.

There are some big continuity jumps.  I don't know if they were unintentional or not but they distract because they distract the audience from the story.  Instead of involving you mind with the story you want to stop everything and figure just how everybody got from where they were seconds ago to where they are now.  The train to Mesa Verde sequence is the prime example.

The movie doesn't seem to know what genre it is:  it's a buddy adventure, it's a dark comedy with bits of slapstick, and it's a anti-  war/ -genocide/ -revolution cry  -- all mashed together.  Maybe that combination is possible to pull of but not by Leone as good as he may have been.

Morricone score would be wonderful as listened too just as music, but is does not feel appropriate to what is on the screen.. To me it sounded more suitable to tragic romantic drama from another era starring perhaps Clark Gable and Ava Gardner.

Anyway, it's not a bad movie and has some good moments but don't imagine for a moment it has any meaningful similarity to the Man With No Name trilogy.",1452988800,,2125,4.563492063492063

396180,5,6301966244,"The 'Clint Eastwood' Trilogy aside, this is, for me far and away the best of the rest of the 'Spaghetti-Westerns' with it's
bucket-full of humour and indeed plenty of explosive action......
Bandit 'Juan Miranda' (Rod Steiger) after his chance encounter with 'Irish' Terrorist and explosives expert 'John H Mallory'
believes he can persuade his new best-friend to align with him and his family to rob the bank in 'Mesa Verda' which he
thinks will be lucrative for all involved, this venture will lead to him becoming part of the revolution that is raging in
Mexico against the tyrannical and oppressive regime.
Of course 'John' is no stranger to revolution, he'd been a key player back in his home country, whereas  'Juan' has little or
no allegiance to any cause other than to himself and family, hardly a revolutionary....until now that is, the streets of 'Mesa
Verda' is patrolled by many troops, the revolutionaries are planning a multi-target attack, 'Juan' is designated with his
family to attack the bank, seems like a good plan ?
'John' is doing that which he knows best, 'Juan' somehow and unwittingly becomes a hero, there was no money or gold to
be found at the bank he'd been asked too attack, however he did free 150 political prisoners.......
We follow the exploits of the 'fire-cracker' 'John' and reluctant hero 'Juan' however events do lead to 'Juan' having a reason
to fight the good fight.
'Rod Steiger' is at his extraordinary best, 'James Coburn' super cool in this explosive, action-packed Western, over two and a
half hours of sheer entertainment - Spaghetti-Style.
The film does have many violent sequences which are not suitable for younger viewers ...
The picture Quality is far superior to it's DVD version, though as is often the case with older movies the distance scenes are
sometimes a little grainy....not enough to spoil the spectacle however.

There is one non-stop annoyance in this and that is Rod Steiger's rendition of a Mexican. It's very, very bad. I do it better. His attire doesn't fit the part either. A revolutionary peasant Mexican in a Fedora hat? I mean it's just not quite right.

For those that give a dang about proper prop selection, you will not be liking the considerable amount of anachronistic mistakes they make with their firearms. One example is the MG-42 (Maschinengewehr 42) that gets used. That machine gun came out in 1942. The film is set during the Mexican Revolution, which started around 1910. There are other mistakes.

396280,4,6301966244,"While this film doesn't quite match up to what you'd expect in all of the well-known Sergio Leone films (the Dollars films, Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In America) in terms of gutsy action and cooler-than-cool, it does have a lot going for it in terms of grandiosity, and is bursting with unmistakable signature Sergio Leone items! Those long, ponderous scenes, amazing desert scenery, gritty anti-heroes, extreme close-ups, and now also some totally cool slow motion flashback sequences offer complicated, ambiguous (and morally ambiguous) hints at what's really going on. Even the music is totally off-kilter, without the obvious Ennio Moriccone themes, the maestro getting extremely experimental (in particular the odd ""Sean Sean"" theme that you hear throughout the whole film in light moments). And, given the nature of James Coburn's character as an IRA terrorist, there's plenty of explosions too! It's also a very long film, and this DVD is the first time that the final version of the Rome premiere is shown in English, with the opening quote from Mao Zedong in it as well (cut from the US releases).

Besides a great running commentary of the film by the ever-droll Sir Christopher Freyling, this set comes with a seemingly-endless array of great bonus features. ""The Myth of Revolution"" (22:00) is narrated by Sir Christopher, who is a Sergio Leone scholar, and we get all sorts of background to the film. He notes that Jason Robards, then Malcolm McDowell were wanted, as was Clint Eastwood, were considered for Hey Farid, for Saturday, let me know if you want me to work any of my contacts. I've got Emerald Street, The Impatiens, and the role of John (Sen) Mallory before they settled on James Coburn. Eli Wallach was also considered for the role of his counterpart Juan Miranda, but the studio wanted a bigger name, so they went for Rod Steiger, then a hot actor coming off of an Academy Award win for In The Heat Of The Night a few years prior. He also tells the story of how the film got its very strange English name - apparently, nobody but Sergio Leone liked the title Duck You Sucker, Leone insisting that anybody in the US or the UK would be familiar with this slang terms (wrong). It had a more successful and appropriate title in France, where it was successful - Once Upon A Time In The Revolution. Apparently, Leone never storyboarded, he could visualise each scene automatically. We also learn that Sergio Leone took the director role of the film reluctantly, after they had a falling out with the original choice Peter Bogdanovich, who had a completely opposite vision for the film. Freyling notes that for all the similarities with his other spaghetti westerns, this is the first time Leone ever really had a ""buddy"" concept going. ""Sergio Donati Remembers Duck You Sucker"" (7:00) is a short chat with the co-writer (with Leone) of the screenplay. ""Once Upon A Time In Italy - The Autry Exhibition"" (6:00) goes into the recreation of Leone memorabilia for this film and others for the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, where we get a curator's view of the creation of this July 2005 exhibit. ""Sorting Out The Versions"" (11:20) does just that, going over the difficulties in creating a consolidated version of the film, given how the US version had the long dream sequence at the end mostly cut out, the grotto scene shortened by three minutes, the train station massacre scene cut in half, and other versions had certain scenes removed entirely (such as the opening scene of urine flowing onto an anthill). The premiere in Rome was 22 minutes longer than the US version. They also shot a torture scene of Dr Virga, and a desert march torture of John by Juan, a la The Good, The Bad and the Ugly where Tuco takes Blondy on a long, thirsty march into the desert - these didn't make the final film. ""Restoration, Italian Style"" (6:10) covers those technicalities, and ""Location companions"" (9:30) revisits the locations, many of which are amazingly unchanged 35 years later, even some of the city scenes!! There are also some ""Radio Spots"" (4:00) and a Trailer (3:40) too. Great stuff!!",1422230400,4,4137,4.802244039270687

396460,4,6301966244,"This is not a review in the traditional sense - and what it contains would qualify as spoiler alerts.

The film I saw in its first release in 1972 is NOT the film presented on this wonderful and intriguingly insightful two-disc edition. Based upon the truncated version I saw in a movie house back then, I thought I knew the full intent of Sergio Leone's controversial film.  But for forty one years I have been largely in the dark.

Until now.  This is the full and unedited version.  It is a much richer and complex film than I had previously been led to believe.  But I want to focus on one issue that, if true, throws the entire character of the movie - and primarily that of James Coburn's character - off the cliff or prior certitude.

Even when I first saw the movie in 1972 and subsequently on TV, I often wondered why Coburn's character would hear such lushly romantic intonations of his supposed name ""Sean"" - as heard repeatedly in the superb Ennio Morricone score - whenever he flashbacked in memory to his revolutionary days in Ireland.  It seemed quite silly. Did he love himself in such an unabashedly romantic way that he heard his name sung repeatedly in his head whenever thinking of  his days on the Emerald Isle? Or did he instead love someone else named Sean? Yes, one way to explain it based upon the available evidence of the 1972 version  would be that he might have switched to the Americanized version of Sean, John, when he came to Mexico.  But still: all of his flashbacks involved a man and a woman.  If he were truly wishing for the good old days of being Sean instead of John, why were the two other people always included in his recollections?  Now, thanks to the SORTING OUT THE VERSIONS featurette on the second disc of this edition, we learn that John might not, in fact, be Sean at all - and that Sean is actually the nameless friend in the flashbacks.  If this is true, it is momentous.  It would then mean that Coburn's John more than likely betrayed his friend to the English authorities over likely jealousy with regards to the woman in the menage a trois memories who is shown in the restored version given the last kiss to the friend, as Coburn looks on with fading smile. Or even further: perhaps John was jealous over his friend's deepening involvement with the female part of the trio. If either perspective is the accurate one,then it helps explain many things: for one, the self-loathing and death wish of the Coburn character. It would also explain his disillusionment with Revolution - NOT because it was HE who had been betrayed, but rather it was he who used the Irish revolution to betray his best friend out of jealousy.
This would also explain the mysterious, mystic relationship John has with the Mexican doctor who also had betrayed his comrades.  The doctor had been tortured into betrayal.  But, in this light, so was John.  Tortured by jealousy and love.  All I know is that after watching this restored version, one might see John Mallory in an entirely new light.

Curiously and disappointingly, this stick of interpretive dynamite is not addressed in Sir Christopher Frayling's nonetheless most interesting commentary on the actual movie.  Frayling is a noted film historian and biographer of Sergio Leone - so it would be MOST curious to know his views on this controversy of John and Sean.  All I know is that the fairly straight-forward action/adventure flick I saw in 1972 is now a complex character study as much as - if not more so - anything else.

Addendum: Given the same historic time-frame and location of both 1968's THE WILD BUNCH and DUCK, YOU SUCKER, might not an influence be drawn from the Pike Bishop character of Peckinpah's masterpiece to Leone's John Mallory?  Both men are on the lamb from their countries of origin.  Both men inadvertently get caught up in the Mexican Revolution.  Both men have several flashbacks to arguably better times.  Most tellingly, Pike's flashbacks involve remembering betraying Robert Ryan's character.  Are John's flashbacks similarly recalling his betrayal of the real Sean?  Interesting, in Frayling's commentary he mentions that Leone had asked Peckinpah to direct DUCK YOU, SUCKER.",1362268800,2,4199,4.745179063360881

Admittedly, Rod Steiger is an excellent actor.  But with so many talented Latino actors available to do the part of the Mexican bandit, one can only imagine how much better the film might have been.  The story is engaging, and James Coburn's performance is memorable.  The music by Enno Morricone adds to the film's appeal.  Sergio
Leone's directing is clumsy in places, and juvenile in others.  However, the film is a wonderful story about the bonding of two men from very different backgrounds,

I think James Coburn brought his full talent to the screen as John, remarkable performance with great passion yet casual approach to the strife of human kind.  While watching this movie, Once Upon A Time In The West is brought to mind, non similar story but a departure from the ordinary in story content and presentation.",1341446400,,633,4.575221238938053

396467,4,6301966244,"Sergio Leone is arguably my favourite director and I regularly re-watch his films... except for A Fistful of Dynamite (or Once Upon a Time... the Revolution, OUTR, as I prefer to think of it). Indeed it's been so long, the last time was on VHS!

The reason for this is that it never quite feels like a Leone film for me. It is neither a western nor does it hit the heights of Once Upon a Time in America; instead it feels like a confused hybrid. All his western trademarks are there - the sweaty FBCUs, wind-hissing wild track, bank robberies, bridges blown-up, Almeria setting, Morricone score etc - but somehow they seemed half-hearted as if Leone was just going through the motions. Things like pace and tension are, in my opinion, sorely missing.

These problems are compound by the plot. I've always been impressed by how Leone made his narratives appear simple while they are actually convoluted and complex. But with OUTR the plot lacks coherence. In many ways it's a series of picaresque set-pieces with tenuous connecting strands - most notably when we move from the carriage/motorcycle opening sequence to the bit when Juan blows up the church. How have we got here? What's going on? I still don't understand. Similarly [spoiler coming next] the scene where's Juan's family is killed. There's no foreshadowing - we just lurch into it. One could argue this is demonstration of Leon's audacity as a director (ie effectively to play the punchline of the scene backwards) but I find it emotionally unsatisfying.

On top of the plot issues are the characters. It's difficult to understand what motivates them. Juan is simpler, but Sean remains an enigma. Why, for instance, does he abandon Juan as the train passes... but waits for him at Mesa Verde? The explanations seem thin and unconvincing. Complex motivation may be lacking in Leone's Dollars Trilogy but that's because the characters are driven by money; their motive is so intrinsic to their characters that it becomes invisible. In OUTR the motivation feels self-conscious - either in explanation or absence of. I also think that Steiger and Coburn (in this picture at least) lack presence and chemistry. They are like a watered down version of Tuco and Blondi with none of the latter pair's outrageous wit or duplicitous energy. One thing I love best about Leone is how he can take minor characters (think of the innkeeper and his wife in Few Dollars More) or even non-speaking extras and make them so vibrant and arresting. Again, in comparison, OUTR seems much blander.

Talking of bland I'm not much impressed with Morricone's score here. It's almost `effeminate', too soft and trilling for the harsh setting of the Mexican Revolution. Perhaps this reflects the softness of the characters. I can't imagine a theme like Harmonica's working for Juan or Sean. As for the `Sean, Sean, Sean' song - maybe I'm missing some subtle point but I think it is unintentionally and inappropriately funny (when it's not being annoying). In fact the score often seems at odds with the action - think again of the scene when Juan finds his family slaughtered.

Having said all the above there are still some wonderful Leone touches: the scene where Juan rips through the eyes of the poster; the look on his face as he opens the bank vaults; the chicken `stroking' scene. The mass execution tracking shot on the roof tops is one of the most powerful in his oeuvre. There are also some fantastic explosions - keep your eye out for the one as Sean blows up the carriage and walks away as a ball of flame rises behind him. Leone is having his most fun with the picture here! I pity the poor camera man though...

All of which brings me to the `packaging' of this version. The film transfer is decent enough, though in places the dialogue track is poor; I assumer this is a problem with the master reel or it may have to do with the post-synching (something discussed in the commentary - more of which in a second). There are also some decent featurettes on the second disc, including a particularly interesting one about the different versions.

The standout highlight though is Christopher Frayling's commentary. This is worth the price of the DVD alone. It is erudite, engaging and will definitely make you look at the film anew. For this reason alone I would recommend you buy a copy.

In conclusion I'm left with very mixed feelings. Leone is undoubtedly a genius but I find this a confused and unsatisfactory film... though I will happily admit to being in the minority, so maybe I've got it wrong; Frayling is certainly a big fan! Part of my problem is that it's impossible to view it without comparing it to his previous - and in my opinion - vastly superior westerns. Nevertheless I would recommend anyone with a passing interesting in the spaghetti western or Leone to buy this version, listen to what Frayling has to say and make up your own mind. 4 stars: more for the overall package than the movie itself.",1339372800,2,4965,4.745075318655852

396514,5,6301966244,"First of all I am a huge Sergio Leone fan and I think he is one of the greatest directors in cinema history. His movies evoke such powerful emotion from the characters, who are all extremely believable. Something else great about Mr. Leone is the scenery in the background and foreground. His western films feature such beautiful landscape. ""Duck, You Sucker"" is no exception. I think its one of his best (possibly better than ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" IMHO).  The chemistry between the Steiger and Coburn characters is exceptional, and both actors shine in their roles:  Steiger as the dirty, vulgar peasant, and Coburn as the Irish revolutionary on-the-run, with a shady, tortured past.

Something that distinguishes this film from Leone's others is the villain. The ""villains"" in this movie truly have minor parts, one being a hated President, and the other being a creepy military leader.  They really aren't that comparable to Henry Fonda in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" or Lee Van Cleef in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" In my opinion, the actual villain in this movie is the oppressive government, which Steiger and Coburn are fighting against.

The 2 Disc Spec. Edition of this movie has great picture and sound quality, and it also has some nice documentaries/featurettes.  This version is definitely an R-rated version, so if you are offended by a dozen or so f-words and some blood, buy the 1 disc version, which is apparently more clean.

Much faster-paced and more enjoyable than the far more praised Once Upon a Time in the West, Duck You Sucker has that glorious sense of adventure that finds its main characters gleefully thrown from one predicament to another while the movie motors along; it's not as good as The Good the Bad and the Ugly, the Morricone score is one of his weakest and Eli Wallach could probably have played Rod Steiger's role better, but it's a really fun movie from a director completely in command of his best genre.

396604,4,6301966244,"This was the only Leone Western I hadn't seen, and I finally took a look.  It's well worth it, especially in this excellent collector's edition set (with audio in English, French or Spanish, subtitles in English or Spanish, a very nice visual transfer, an intriguing commentary, and a few featurettes that I haven't had a chance to check out yet).

Initially the film seemed to be a bit lighter in tone than some of the others - it starts out with Rod Steiger, a seemingly hapless peasant who turns out to be a clever bandit, relieving himself on a bunch of fireants as they roam about an old dead tree.  Later, we meet James Coburn's apparently loony Irish bomber, who tosses dynamite like it's going out of style.

It turns out both characters have a great deal of depth to them - Steiger's not just a self-centered bandit, though he is that.  He values family above all else, and sees nothing around him to suggest that struggles for justice, revolution and ideals amount to anything more than schemes and myths perpetrated by the elites to serve their own interests.  Coburn, who still believes in something, has been burned in the past and is afraid to trust anyone.

Everything we've come to know and love in Leone's films is here - the Morricone musical motifs, the attention to faces as landscape, the unsubtle but powerful performances (especially Steiger, who is brilliant in this role - you can read his thoughts directly on his face and in his eyes).  There is, more, a much more direct political edge to this one, and especially a critique of the Marxists who, contra Marx, insist on reiterating class differences at the level of a division between the head (leadership) and the hands (the expendible peasant soldiers).

396660,5,6301966244,"I liked this film though it took a while to get into into it.  I didn't much like the characters in the beginning though the shape the story takes as it continues becomes enthralling, funny even, and poignant.  Great cinematography and landscapes as one would expect from a Sergio Leone movie and Ennio Morricone's music is ironically light and happy - and excellent - as would also be expected.  It takes a good half the movie for the viewer to see where the story is going.  Morricone seems to be making a lot of interesting statements along the way.  When the privileged and wealthy passengers are calling the laborers and peasants 'animals' as they are eating we get these close-ups of them feeding their faces, very 'animalistic' essentially and a great irony to their dialogues.  Also listening to the main anti-hero guy talk about what he thinks of revolution is fascinating as is the quote by Mao Tse Deng in the beginning of the movie which then sets a tone that is accurately realized in what amounts to the genocide that the war entails.  The cool thing about the story is that with the revolution as a back-drop, one guy is an Irish guy, former IRA explosives expert who's come to help out in the Mexican revolution (for money or out of conviction I wasn't sure exactly), but his would-be friend (a Mexican bandito) is only in it for the money.  As circustances would have it though, he inadvertantly becomes a hero of the very revolution he despises.  He just wants to rob banks!

Anyway, I started off liking it, then thinking it was slowish, then becoming more intrigued and finally thinking - man! Sergio Leone does it again!

Incidentally, for the zone 2 version of this movie titled ""A Fistful Of Dynamite"", the widescreen transfer looked great, had subtitles in English and other languages and offered an interesting movie trailer for special features, but no more (and no less!).",1234656000,2,1899,4.724242424242425
396661,4,6301966244,"A few years ago, after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B0000AUHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>&nbsp;for the first time, it occurred to me how much like an opera it was, and how the rest of Sergio Leone's filmography followed the same example.  Larger than life characters, huge canvases on which to tell the story, fatally flawed people adopted straight from classical lit - all that was missing was the large lady in the wings, waiting to hit the final notes.  It makes sense, then, how his characters were not quite as subject to reality as normal people, and how whatever may have been true about the west did not stand in the way of telling his story.  It has always seemed to me that most important aspect of 'The West' in Leone's work is the possibilites such a setting might offer rather than accuracy.

And so it seems to me once again after watching 'Duck, You Sucker', the story of two rogues with different ideologies who get caught up in the Mexican Revolution in 1913.  This film takes a definite political stand, something briefly glimpsed in a few scenes in Leone's previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/6304698798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>, and the scenes of revolution assist Leone in making his point.  I'm no expert, but looking for much accuracy in 'Duck, You Sucker' is probably as useless as looking for an accurate portrayal of the civil war in 'Good, Bad, and Ugly'.

But that's just it - none of these films are 'about' the setting around them.  It just doesn't matter, it's all about the story, and each of Leone's stories demanded one thing - a cast capable of carrying the larger than life roles Leone had planned for them.  He only got it exactly right once with 'Good, Bad, and Ugly'.  Eastwood couldn't make the other Man With No Name movies rise to the same level by himself - he needed 'Tuco' more than anyone else did, apparently.  'Once Upon A Time In The West' comes close, but Robards and Bronson are completely overmatched by Fonda.  So that leaves Steiger and Colburn in 'Duck, You Sucker' as a close third.

Regardless, this is great moviemaking fun.  From the few minutes of commentary I listened to, I gathered that Rod Steiger's part was originally written for Eli Wallach, but the studio thought they needed a bigger name.  That's a shame - I can only imagine how much better this film might have been with Wallach.  Not that Steiger does a bad job, but Tuco is one of my all time favorite movie characters, and I think Wallach could have handled this part with ease.  It takes a while to settle in with James Colburn and Steiger - their screen time never meshes as well as Eastwood and Wallach.  Both men are credible actors though, and their characters are perhaps some of Leone's most realistic.

Ennio Morricone returns with another odd soundtrack, but in my opinion, he doesn't cut it this time.  One of his hallmarks is making the soundtrack an actual piece of the story, but here it seems intrusive and grating.  And how 'Duck, You Sucker' as a title ever made it into English is baffling.  Maybe it sounds better in Italian, but 'Fistful of Dynamite' seems much more appropriate to me.

Those are really the only drawbacks to this movie.  The rest is all vintage Leone with his extreme facial closeups and black humor.  The only trademark missing is that one iconic scene, like the beginning of 'Once Upon A Time In The West' or the ending of 'Good, Bad, and Ugly'.  Italian westerns may be a bit of an acquired taste, but Leone was one of the genre's best directors, and 'Duck, You Sucker' is a must see now that it's been released in its intended form.  Nothing's missing, not even a second disc full of extras that I doubt I'll ever watch.  I will probably listen in on the commentary some day though - just the few minutes I already heard were interesting.

Not quite the classic that 'Good, Bad, and Ugly' became, but still a very enjoyable movie.",1233360000,,4140,4.92507204610951
396662,5,6301966244,"The wait was quite long for the remaining 3 remastered Leone movies. These DVDs had been out in the UK/Region 2 for since 18 April 2005, 2+ years (5 June 2007.)

  Duck You Sucker is the least of the Once Upon A Time films but is still great. The title is not American parlance but it doesn't matter. I am glad to finally be able to see it. I love the actors: Rod Steiger and James Coburn. I think both are under appreciated. Memorable scenes include the faces montage on the stage coach, the scene in the bank basement, the massacre in the trenches, the communist book getting run over, and my favorite is the betrayal in the rain scene and how the wiper blade is going. The ending is great and reminds me somewhat of Frankenheimer's The Train. Great model work saves movie budgets and allow for that nice stagecoach and armored car. The Morricone score is great. The chorus sings ""Juan, Juan, Juan"" and the easier to understand, ""Sean, Sean, Sean."" Sir Christopher Frayling is wrong when he says that the lyrics are unintelligible. The extras are pretty good if less cohesive than other DVD supplements out there.

  This movie is a dress rehearsal for Once Upon A Time In America. The flashbacks get more numerous and more complex through the three films. The final flashback in this film seems quite risque and not at all how it stared out in the auto at the beginning. The early scene of implied sexuality with Steiger leaves some ambiguity about violence that is not there in Once Upon A Time In America. All the violence was ratcheted up and yet hung on a moving story. I would love to see the purported 6.5 hour cut of that movie.

  The picture is great on my 24"" flat screen tube TV fed through component inputs and shown 4:9 letterbox.  The Lowry process has made them as new or maybe even better than when originally released (not alive when in initial release.) I hope a 16:9 progressive scan capable TV will make the image that much better. The sound is good. I do not have a 5.1 capable receiver, just as well with the new Blu-Ray audio options making older units closer to obsolescence. (I can't wait to listen to Leon: The Professional and Patriot Games among others in DTS someday and hope that Ronin and Braveheart will come out in DTS at some point.)

  The 2 disc white Amaray case with slipcase is much better than the bulky case that came with The Good, The Bad... in 2004. The only problem would be getting white replacement cases at a reasonable cost.

  If you have not seen Once Upon A Time In The West, get the 2 disc SE now, it is cheap to buy. The musical theme for Jill with Edda Dell'Orso's voice is angelic.

Juan is more interested in gold, money, and dynamite than in political prisoners, but when the political prisoners appear he seems to feel they are worthless people.

In the film Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) is a Mexican bandit who, after just robbing a stage coach, shoots out a tire on  a strange motorcyclist in full gear.  The motorcyclist is Sean Mallory (James Coburn) who has flashbacks of his background as an Irish terrorist.  After they meet - Sean shows Juan his coat full of dynamite and says that if he is shot, everyone blows up. Something clicks between them - two strange and somewhat wacky men. Juan talks Sean into robbing the Bank of Mesa Verde.  Sean, with his gaming personality, fixes things so that Juan frees many political prisoners while looking for the safe in the bank. After that, Juan begins to change from a bandit to a full- blown revolutionary, while Sean develops in another way.

There are many surprises, some wry humor, and good scenery and props.  The Mexican Army reminded me of Hitler's SS Troops but almost in cartoon-like way.  There are many exciting scenes and more blasts along the way.  This movie has it all.

I enjoyed the movie - well done and not a ""canned"" type of Western.  Interesting characters who lead you through all kinds of and twists and turns.

Another excellent spaghetti western from the master himself, though a bit different from what we're used to.  As far as the plot goes, we have Juan(Rod Steiger) as a Mexican bandit with his sights set on a bank.  Fate crosses his paths with Irish demolitions expert, John(James Coburn), who's a wanted man for his revolutionary acts in Ireland.  Together they set out to rob this bank, but instead end up heroes in the Mexican revolution.  Though this is Leone's genre, the movie is quite different than his previous four westerns.  It has some humorous moments, but the movie is rather grim and doesn't show the Mexican revolution in the heroic light as many other westerns do.  Most of Leone's playfulness is gone.  There is a lack of the lone, nameless gunfighter that we're used to seeing(which means there are none of those legendary quickdraw showdowns).  We have two central protagonist that don't achieve that mythic status like Eastwood and Bronson.  Both are antiheroes and you grow to like them over the course of the movie, but they are scumbags for lack of a better term.  Early in the movie Juan rapes a woman!  There's no larger than life villain either.  There are two guys that play the villain role, but only because the enemy needed a figure to represent itself.  There's alot more profanity this time around, and Leone has now discovered squibs for some of the bloody gunshot wounds.  There seems to have been a decent budget on this movie because some of the battle scenes are very impressive.  Leone still shows us he knows how to compose a shot.  There's one scene showing four trenches full of Mexican revolutionaries getting executed that is breathtaking.  Naturally, Leone takes his time in telling this story.  His movies tend to be paced kinda slow to pull you in.  He hated the fast pacing of Hollywood movies.  Coburn and Steiger give excellent performances.  I've always liked James Coburn and never thought much one way or the other about Steiger, but this movie changed my mind about that.  His role is pretty much the same as Eli Wallach's Tuco from The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  Just imagine a movie where Tuco is the main character and that should give you a good idea.  Fans of Lucio Fulci should keep an eye out for David Warbeck in a small role in James Coburn's flashback scenes.  So all in all, a great western.

396715,4,6301966244,"""Duck, You Sucker"" (also known as ""A Fistful of Dynamite"") is one of those films you need to watch a couple of times before you can fully appreciate it.  It's another Western epic from Sergio Leone, yet it is extremely different from his famous ""Man with No Name"" trilogy.  Filled with more deep personal conflicts, transformations and revelations, this makes for one entertaining film.

Juan is a despicable thief and sometimes murderer who's not afraid to get his hands a little dirty if it means getting goods and money for he and his family.  John is an Irish Revolutionary who has expertise in blowing just about anything up to smithereens.  When Juan sees the man in action, he gets the idea that John could help him empty out the bank of his dreams.  With Juan's trigger finger and John's dynamite tossing, how could it go wrong?  The only thing is Juan ends up getting himself involved in an unexpected revolution that he never wanted to be a part of, and for better or worse the two end up forming a very odd bond and team.

I wouldn't call this my favorite Leone film, but it is one I find myself watching again and again.  There's just something very appealing about it, and that's no easy feat when you really set out to have your main guy, Rod Steiger who plays ""Juan,"" to be as despicable and vile as they come.  Within the first 10 minutes or so, we see him kill somebody, rob a group of snobs and even rape a woman snob (though the rape isn't violent and is relatively short, it still is rape).  I really thought there was no way in hell I would be able to sympathize for a character like that, but I knew there was the great James Coburn who could make the movie work for me.  Surprise, Leone really does actually get you to care about Juan as you see him grow and mature through this little quest (he's still very flawed and shallow at times, but the growth and transformation is undeniable).  And Colburn, who plays ""John,"" is also not without his many flaws, as he's a tortured soul who can't seem to let go of the past.  The two men are absolutely fantastic in their roles.

This new 2-Disc edition of ""Duck, You Sucker"" includes the complete 157 minute version that wasn't shown in the U.S., which includes a lot of extended scenes and flashbacks (most noticeably the three minute flashback at the end that was usually trimmed down to keep the flow and avoid confusion).  The movie looks and sounds great, and if you're afraid the 5.1 surround will ruin the authenticity or credibility of the film, you can always watch it in mono.  There are some nice featurettes and a commentary from a film historian, Sir Christopher Frayling.

""Duck, You Sucker"" has a great balance of action, comedy, drama and even heart at times.  Again, I don't know if I would call this his best film, but it is definitely one of Sergio Leone's more entertaining films.  I'd say put this on your list at some point, especially if you're a huge film buff, as it is a very different movie experience.  So sit down, grab some popcorn and enjoy the show, but beware if at some point in your living room you hear a fuse and some stranger in the distance yelling, ""Duck, you sucker!"" -Michael Crane",1184371200,61,3190,4.474956822107081

Way too long and unnecessarily slow (even for Leone's standards). A cartoonish overlook at the Mexican Revolution. The characters are exaggerated to fit into the stereotypes of a loathable capitalist troupe (the American empresario, the rich and sexually repressed woman, the gluttonous priest, the mercenarious soldiers...) presented against the revolutionaries (the sly and higly read leader, the specialist -James Coburn, the dynamiter-, and the mass of poor). Rod Steiger, who plays the main role, is the individualistic outsider, however, he ends up getting involved in the revolution unwillingly. What he cares for is himself and his family. He is not such a sucker as to fight for the intellectuals who promise that changes are about to happen and end up taking the place of the former oligarchy; while those who really fight -the poor- will end up probably dead. So there is a lesson here. It's more a political coming of age story.

There's not much talking but a few lines do stand out: ""I've only judged once in my life and I will never do it again."" Says Coburn, meaning when in the past, when he was fighting for the Irish revolution he had to ""follow the rules of engagement"", let's put it this way (not to give out too much of the story); or ""if I have to choose between the chicken-thieves and the uniform killers I'd rather choose the uniform killers"",
Coburn's words after realizing how much hypocrisy was on the side of the revolutionaries but choosing not be a free-thinking individualist like Steiger is. The 2 men become great pals and the movie rests most of its interest on that friendship, specially since they represent psychologies so much apart (in the beginning).

So even though politics seems to be the issue targeted here, it's only the background for the real story: human life, friendship, family, love. The utopian ideals are dead by the end of the film, and one friend finds himself holding the other -who is about to die- while saying to him: ""Remember (what we said) about America..."" What started as a utopia, ended as a dream: the American Dream (which is more than many people can afford).",1184284800,4,2143,4.833787465940055

396758,4,6301966244,"Those thinking that ""Duck, You Sucker"" is in the mold of the ""Dollars"" trilogy and ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" are in for a rude awakening.  The film's setting is not what you would call the traditional West rather revolutionary Mexico in the early part of the 20th century.  Like other Leone epics it is deliberately paced but no less effective.  Leone isn't so much concerned with taking sides rather the toll revolution takes on a man's soul.  The violence and the betrayals of war are an inherent byproduct and they wear on a man's visage.  Leone offers two characters as our guides through the chaos: Juan(Rod Steiger), a peasant revolutionary so disgusted by war that his motives now are mostly mercenary and Sean(James Coburn), an escaped IRA munitions expert who hires out his services to the insurgents.  Steiger is certainly fine but it's Coburn who steals the show as a man debating within himself why he does what he does.  For sure Leone stages alot of thrilling action sequences but it's in the film's quieter moments that offer food for thought.  I've seen this film in truncated TV version's under the title of ""A Fistful of Dynamite"".  These versions are generally incoherent and are mainly concerned with the film's pyrotechnics.  Avoid these versions if at all possible.",1183420800,2,1292,4.831818181818182
396759,5,6301966244,"This film disappointed many Leone fans when it came out, because it is not a shoot 'em up like his earlier films. It has plenty of action but is much more cerebral and a character study of two men who are changed by their association with the other. Both try to use the other for their own gain, but in the end, become much wiser and better friends, despite the fact that they start off as enemies.

It has some very valid things to say about leftism and revolutionaries that are as timely today as in 1972.

Yes, Steiger's accent is horrible. He sounds like he is trying to imitate Pacino in Scarface, which came out 10 years later. Coburn's accent is laid on pretty thick. But, once you get past that, and you can, it really is an astounding piece of film making. Something you don't see anymore. While big budget films of today are long on spectacle, they have very little to say that isn't obvious or lame. This film is both intelligent and awe inspiring in some of its sequences.

Further, it's full of subtly and nuance. Something you'd never see in an American film of this scale. Highly recommended. I can watch this film every year without bordom.",1182556800,3,1156,4.443396226415095

Much later after the screening, that is.  Will you? A no brainer film like this making me work the final flashback sequence out into the whole of James Coburn's character so that he made some kind of sense in the story.  My compliments to Mr. Leone! Incredible acting from James Coburn and Rod Stieger.  Yes, Stierger's accent is bad but who cares! The feeling he gives to his character is incredible! Great cinema, many memorable lines, and an enduring film score; one of Morricone's finest.  Don't expect anything from this film.  It is better that way.  Give it room to breath and allow it to take you where it wants to go, and soon you will experience a feeling that you are definately on a ride.

396761,4,6301966244,"I am a big fan of Sergio Leone. There are no other movies quite like his. His use of wide vistas and extreme close-ups is well known along with a penchant for large scale action set pieces and sudden bursts of violence. As a silent film fan though I admire his lack of dialogue, deliberate pace, and use of music/sound effects to underscore the action and propel the story along. Nowhere is that more in evidence than in GIU LA TESTA (lower your head or keep your head down) known as DUCK, YOU SUCKER which is the middle film in his final trilogy of ONCE UPON A TIME cinematic fairy tales (Leone originally wanted to call this film ONCE UPON A TIME...THE REVOLUTION).

Released in 1972 in a variety of running times and under various titles (A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE in the U.K. and the U.S.), it disappeared quickly and has been unseen in it's original form until the release of this DVD. At 157 minutes it's 37 minutes longer than previous prints and the footage that was cut is of great significance as it provides the heart and soul of the picture and deepens the relationship between the Rod Steiger and James Coburn characters. It also restores the overtly political message of the film about war in general and revolution in particular. The accents employed by Steiger and Coburn are frequently criticised but that misses the point as they're not meant to be realistic.

Everything in Leone is exaggerated deliberately to create the effect he wants. The long pauses, the flashbacks, the larger than life performances are all there to magnify the intensity of the character's emotions and to inspire their reactions to what goes on around them. When Leone's films are cut or rearranged (as his last four films were) it actually makes them seem longer because the grand design has been tampered with and it throws them out-of-sync. While Leone loved the look of American movies he hated their pacing which is the opposite of a storyteller's and that's what he was. His three last films were the prime examples of his skills in that department.

The new widescreen print of DUCK, YOU SUCKER is gorgeous and the sound has been remixed but it's the missing footage that really turns this film from just a spectacular action picture into something far more substantial that will stay with you long after it's over as all of Leone's best movies tend to do. Repeated viewings will only deepen the experience as you just can't get it all in one sitting. For it's offbeat sense of humor, Ennio Morricone's surreal score, the most spectacular train wreck ever filmed, and the surprising depth of Steiger's and Coburn's performances, DUCK, YOU SUCKER, while not his best (that's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST), remains my favorite Sergio Leone film.",1182124800,6,2740,4.7280334728033475
396762,5,6301966244,"As finally this grande filme from mestre Serginho has finally arrived to USA in DVD format, most has been said from the various Amazon reviews, and the intrevistas within the DVD itself!
Just to add my own ""dos centavos"" , two items I note that I feel of additional interest to add

1) Rod Steiger, not the 1st choice for the character , the bandito Juan, and his acting really adds to the film. His ""spanish accent"" the absolute WORSE, only Al Pacino as Scarface inlater years was as much a ""supremo absurdo""! haha! This ""accent"" adds flavour and more humor to ""Juan"", and I think a ""lucky accident"" Eli Wallach (Tuco , from the ""good, bad, an ugly"") did not get the role. (even as Eli is one of my favourite USA actors, and his portrayal of Tuco ""legend"" in film histories..)

2) the soundtrack of ""Gi la Testa"" (the original title I know this film by..),one of the greatest soundtracks of mestre Morricone, and for soundtracks in general. I higly recommend to find and purchase, a wonderful companion to the film.

1000000000 stars for signore Leone, as always, his epic films perfect, ""warts and all"", as they say...",1182124800,3,1120,4.59
396763,1,6301966244,"I have loved Serio Leone's films since the 60s, so it's truly difficult to pan anything made by this great genius of the cinema, but, man, this one sucked. Why? Rod Steiger miscast in the role (that should have been played by the one and only Eli Wallach) of a Mexican peasant; James Coburn also miscast in his role. I have seen these actors do fine work in other films (Steiger in The Pawnbroker; Coburn in The Magnificent Seven, etc.), but here, they simply were not only miscast, but have absolutely no chemistry and do not play off each other very well. I won't even go into the accents they attempt and attempt and attempt... This is always laughable. (My advice to actors is this: Don't. Just don't.)

Re: Extras. Not all that interesting, either.

Leone's other films: Fisful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, Once Upon A Time In the West, Once Upon A Time In America... Quite possibly masterpieces. Duck, You Sucker doesn't have it. Am not laying blame at Leone's feet, either. The screenplay isn't there, and as I already mentioned, whoever cast the leads did not help matters one bit.

Story is the studio forced Leone to use Steiger (for the better name value) even though the part had been written for Eli Wallach. Wallach, in my humble opinion, would have made this role sing, would have given it pizzazz and comedic timing that only ""Tuco"" had the ability to bring to the character.

My 2 cents.",1182124800,11,1411,4.587301587301587
396764,4,6301966244,"No, unfortunately, this DVD version does NOT include the infamous, deleted torture scene of Steiger's and Coburn's friend, although there is a black and white still photo or two of this deleted scene in the special features section (one of the documentaries).
This DVD version is good and in many places, it looks fantastic. In a few spots, particularly the night shots, it is kind of hit and miss. Nothing unwatchable, but it's apparent they didn't take quite the same care of restoring this film as they did with ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" DVD. There is a trailer in the special features section for ""TGBTU"" DVD, and it looks tremendous. Probably a frame-by-frame restoration, at least it appears that way in the trailer. ""Duck You Sucker"" looks good, but not as fantastic as it could have looked. Like the recent ""Star Wars"" original version DVDs - nothing unwatchable, but they could have been cleaned up a bit more visually.
Really good movie. I would have liked to have known why Rod Steiger allegedly was difficult, at times, to deal with on the set. Maybe Oscar fever?
The special features section also has another documentary that talks about a myth about Coburn's flashbacks, and why he first says ""Shawn"" before saying ""John"" to Rod Steiger. Interesting ...
Another myth says Coburns' guilt about the past is for another reason ....

""A Fistful of Dynamite""  fits with Sergio Leone's western trilogy (""A fistful of Dollars"", etc.), but he shouldn't have been intimidated by those in the U.S. who insisted its title was ""dirty"".  I still thrill to see  Coburn or  Steiger yell: ""Duck, Yous Suckers!"" just instants before a ear-shattering blast.  It is one of my boyhood memories, like ""Planet of the Apes"", or other classics indelibly etched in my memory.  The film was a fun Sunday afternoon at 75 cents, the last I saw it in a big theater--television doesn't make it for the scope and scenery of the film.  A few too-many close-ups (of egg-sucking Colonels, and the like), but Leone is famed for this, like his five-minute  standoff between the three characters at the end of ""The Good The Bad, and the Ugly"".  Coburn plays an ice-cold parallel to Clint Eastwood; Steiger is a hotheaded bandido like Eli Wallach as ""Tuco"".  But, the charters are more complicated than that.  Mallory's flashbacks to Ireland show him how little has changed; Juan Miranda's loss of his world-his family-and how his friendship develops with Mallory makes a unique story.

This is a two disc set in the PAL format (USA, region 1 is formatted in NTSC). The movie is 158 min long under the PAL format (but according to one reviewer from the UK, the movie is actually 150 min, go figure: 8 minutes is a long time). The second disc contains a number of features including one describing the various versions of the movie (from its 120 min USA version up to this 158 min version). For more information, you should google (Fistful Of Dynamite MGM Home Entertainment).

I have not seen this movie and have graded at 4 stars only because I cannot imagine it to be better than Once Upon A Time In The West (5 stars in my book), and to give Amazon a value for their star system.

Hopefully MGM Home Entertainment will release a NTSC formatted Region 1 version to the USA or at least allow Amazon to release the European version to its US customers (Did you read this request, Amazon.com?).

By the way, here are claimed durations of the various versions of this movie: 120 min, 138 & 139 min, 147 min, 154 min, 157 & 158 (150) min and one Amazon review claims a 165 min version. In addition, there are country specific versions: USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, Australia and probably more that I don't know about.

It's clear that the 120 and 138 min USA versions are butchered and so poorly color corrected (as a couple of Amazon reviews noted) that this -NEWLY RESTORED VERSION- will be greatfully appreciated, enjoyed and evaluated in depth by Sergio Leone fans, Spaghetti Western fans, and movie goers in general in the USA.

396848,5,6301966244,"A Fistful of Dynamite is a very enjoyable western full of plenty of action that.  A Mexican bandit, Juan, robs a stagecoach with his gang of family members when he runs into IRA fugitive and demolitions expert, John Mallory, on his motorcycle traveling across the desert.  At first, they do not get along, but soon begin working together.  Juan and John become involved in the Mexican Revolution and Juan inadvertently frees hundred of political prisoners from what he thought was a bank.  Eventually, the two become heroes of the revolution.  Along the way, a sadistic officer with his well-armed militia begins to track them down for all of the trouble they have caused.  This is a very exciting movie with plenty of good action scenes as well as great, fully-developed characters.  A Fistful of Dynamite is not Sergio Leone's best movie, but it is still very good and well worth a watch if you can find a copy.
  Rod Steiger and James Coburn are great together as the two men who team up to work together during the Mexican Revolution.  Their friendship is the high point of the movie along with the impressive action sequences, most notably the bridge explosion halfway through the movie.  I've always thought this was one of Coburn's best performances, and Steiger is no slouch either.  This is a great spaghetti western that does slow some with politics, but it is still a great movie.

Be warned, this movie is really two movies in one.  The first half is a light comedy, but the second half turns dark and sad.  James Coburn projects an undercurrent of a man who may not regret his past, but would like to re-live it.  The movie is set in the American West in the early 1900's.  Coburn is an Irish Republican Army terroist who had to flee Ireland and is trying to hide out.  Rod Steiger plays a Mexican peasant who robs people for a living.  After robbing a custom stagecoach, Coburn happens along and Steiger tries to have some fun with Coburn.  Without giving the movie away, the results are not what was expected.  Coburn and Steiger end up going after the same goal, for differnt reasons.  Again, the result is not what either expects.  The end result is a lesson learned by both.

""DUCK, YOU SUCKER!"" was written across the marquee (the original title) and we just had to see this movie.  It might have been the action or it might have been puberty, but I fell in love with this movie.  Years later, after the re-release on video, I got to see the movie all over again.  Unlike the unfortunate ""HARD DAYS NIGHT,"" this movie WAS just as good as the first time I saw it.  Leone got the mix right. This film flows with style.  James Coburn (one of my favorite actors because of this role) has a natural understated manner played against the mad fire breathing Rod Steiger.  This pairing resulted from the practice he had with the infamous Clint Eastwood / Eli Wallach characters in ""THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.""  Like all Leone films, the music will stay with you long after the film.  Morricone's soundtracks were always ahead of their time.  Always haunting and heavy handed.
The movie is full of contrast.  The IRA soldier on the run meets with an unlikely rebel army...on the run.  Steiger is the black kettle constantly boiling over while Coburn is the subdued warrior looking for his last battle.  Steiger desperately needs this crazy bomber ""with the balls like the bull"" to help him focus his rage into a winning campaign.  Coburn needs a constant distraction from painful memories of a home he cannot return to.  The flashbacks are frequent and confusing, but it all comes together in the end.

396928,4,6301966244,"Originally and horribly titled ""Duck, you sucker"", Fistful of Dynamite is a very political western circa early `70s. Rod Steiger plays the role of a Mexican bandit who ends up in a partnership with James Coburn. Coburn is an expat Irish revolutionary, complete with dynamite and a motorcycle on the run in Mexico. Both are simply excellent in their roles even though Coburn has a tendency to fall in and out of his Irish accent.
Politics plays a central role in this film. It opens with a quote from Chairman Mao on the nature of violence and revolution. The first scene is chock full of class warfare as Steiger's character is humiliated by the upper-class riders on the stage.  Slowly Stieger is converted from bandit to revolutionary by Coburn. This is also one of Leone's most violent films (which is saying a lot); in one scene government troops are shown massacring hundreds in retaliation for rebel attacks.

You don't have to be left wing to enjoy Fistful of Dynamite. Neither side is really pictured in a positive manner; even the rebel leadership is duplicitous and even treasonous. In the end this is a very entertaining film, which has been in the shadow of Leone's other works. Interestingly he originally wanted to call this ""Once Upon a Time, a Revolution"", the first part of a Once Upon a Time trilogy. And of course don't miss the eerie and downright weird Ennio Morricone score (which I've been looking for since I watched this film).",1036454400,3,1452,4.757936507936508

The whole bunch is, in turn, caught up in the Mexican Revolution.
  I know this was supposed to be a part of a trilogy by Leone but this movie stands alone just fine. Both Coburn and Steiger play guys who are, at first, totally self-interested and then begin to need each other but so slowly that it is completely believable. Nothing seems inevitable in this movie and saccharine, sentimental and schlocky this movie is not.

Coburn and Steiger constantly lose their accents, and Morricone's score is terrible, full of early 1970's hippie strings and birdlike songs.  The action consists strictly of blowing things up, which gets boring very quickly.  Not a good film from a cinematic master.",982281600,4,304,5.291666666666667
396934,4,6301966244,"The faces of nine men are shown to the Doctor before they are executed. Having it on video I asked myself 'Are we supposed to recognise these faces from having seen them earlier in the film?'. So I watched this scene together with the earlier scene where there is a planning meeting, and I matched some of the faces. In the first group of three the thin faced young man with a beard, and possibly Miguel the little man, who was smoking and coughing. The third, the tall man with a moustache could be the one who was standing wearing an apron at the meeting. The second group of three includes the young man with curly hair (who was seated at the meeting) and glasses, another big man with a moustache (who had been standing next to the Doctor) and I think the one earlier referred to as 'Jesus' who nodded his head when being told his part of the plan. In the last group of 3 I think the dark skinned one was recognisable from the meeting, but the other short man with glasses and the tall clean shaven man don't match with any of the faces seen earlier. If anybody has any further details about matching faces of people being executed with faces seen earlier in the film, I'd be interested on hearing about it on robertdhaines@hotmail.com.",969753600,3,1240,4.419213973799127

The first being (C'era Una Volta Il West - Once Upon a Time in The West, The second  being (Giu La Testa - A Fistful Of Dynamite aka Duck You Sucker and finally C'era Una Volta in America - Once Upon a Time in America all three separating periods of history. Duck you Sucker is a really good film and its to do with Mexican Revolution. Coburn with his heavy broagie Irish accent lends a little credence but its Steiger who steals the show for me. He is the ultimate and consumate actor and gives it socks. All in all the film is great with a beautiful score by Maestro Morricone. Enough said.",1522713600,,755,4.316901408450704

The considerable talents of James Coburn and Rod Steiger are wasted here too.

7818673,5,6301966244,"On some levels, the film is not quite what you'd expect from a Sergio Leone film. On other levels, Leone's world-weary cynicism, melancholia, and epic displays of violence shines through. While Duck, You Sucker is not as good as the Man With No Name trilogy or Once Upon a Time in the West...it is vastly superior to other spaghetti westerns. I've also grown to love the Ennio Morricone soundtrack as well.",1510358400,,406,4.732394366197183

7818677,5,6301966244,"This is Otaku John, checking in to rate one of my favorite films, ""Duck You Sucker"", aka A fistful of dynamite.  This is one of the BEST westerns, especially in the Mexican Revolution / ""Zapata"" genre of films, ever made.  Sergio Leone ( director of the man with no name trilogy ) outdid himself, and that's quite a feat, considering how great A fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more, and the good, the bad, and the ugly were!  In my opinion, both Rod Steiger and James Coburn deserved Oscars for their performances, and that's no exaggeration.  The writing is top-notch, and the music is hauntingly beautiful.  For under $10, this film is a steal.  Even if you've never seen it, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  You may also like of the same genre: The Wild Bunch, The Professionals, and The Mercenary.  All available here on Amazon at great prices too.  Together, they make a great collection!",1503532800,,904,4.628930817610063
