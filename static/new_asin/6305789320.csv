7894562,3,6305789320,the first two story were in engish the rest was in japanese which i didn't like but the story were ok,1366156800,,101,3.857142857142857
7894563,2,6305789320,"Eat-Man 98 is a vaguely interesting series. The show is made of short story arcs, ranging from mildly entertaining to downright ridiculous or boring. The animation is average and the music selection is nothing special. The only thing that kept me interested was Bolt Crank's character who remains a mystery till the end. His motivations were unclear which I found more intriguing than irritating. Bolt Crank could be a much more interesting character if the anime had better storylines and direction. Not recommended but worth a peek if you enjoy the strong silent characters.",1115078400,,576,5.138297872340425
7894564,4,6305789320,"I've seen both EAT-MAN '97 and '98. '97 being my personal favorite. Anyway...The Eat-Man series is a very nice anime about a Mercenary (kills for money, Bolt Crank) who eats everything from a 9mm Pistol to an Out-of-this-world-huge-BEAM-gun... and after digesting it he makes it appear out of his right hand (this is the way he goes potty). Anyway, I like the series, its all kinda nice if you would like to see what the world would be like in a future or whatever.",1020988800,,465,4.5476190476190474
7894565,4,6305789320,"To be honest, I didn't expect much when I bought this DVD set.  I'd heard all the bad reviews, all the bad ratings.  Why did I buy it, then?  I have no idea.
But I was pleasantly surprised.  This show is hardly as bad as people portray it to be.  The animation is fluid, and I didn't notice hardly any re-used cels.  The colors are vividly beautiful.  The character designs are nice.
The music is nothing to jump up and down over.  It's not bad, not too good.  While watching the show, I listened to only a few seconds before skipping over the opening and ending themes, but I tend to do that with all my anime shows, unless the themes really catch my attention.
The characters were actually a lot more interesting than critics declared.  Bolt Crank IS an extremely taciturn character, but the times when he cracks out a sullenly cold one-liner were well-done.  And I don't know if I've been watching too much anime, but I couldn't stop cracking up at the parts where an armed person threatens Bolt, and Bolt calmly eats the weapon right out of the person's hands, in front of shocked bystanders who are like, ""What the--?""  The side characters were also interesting, especially the characters from the four-parter.
Plots were somewhat predictable, but if you're coming into this series looking for something astoundingly original--that is, besides the ""eating metal and producing it out of your hand"" stuff--then you're looking in the wrong place.  Eatman 98 is not philosophical and thought-provoking high entertainment, but it IS entertaining.  And for the price it's going at, this is a steal.",1020211200,4,1597,4.76
7894566,3,6305789320,"I bought Eat-Man '98 for ($) and I thought it was a good buy for that amount of money.  You get 5 hours of episodes and there are some good ones mixed in there.  My big compliant is that Bolt Crank is supposed to be the strong silent type, but to me that just means he is really boring.  The action scenes were good, but you always want Bolt to show some emotion and he never does.  It is a alright set, but not the best by any means.",998524800,,434,3.842696629213483
7894567,4,6305789320,"EatMan 98 has incredible animation, a fun soundtrack, and pretty good stories. If you're expecting epic plotlines, you will be disappointed--each episode or group of episodes is a ""day in the life"" of the  mercenary Bolt Crank, with no overall story arc. However, the standalones  are quite good, and reveal a little bit more about Bolt's character each  time. Ultimately, the series focusses on ""ain't Bolt cool?"" If  you agree, you'll have fun--but if you don't, you'll be screaming about the  tenth time he calmly walks in to save the day, accompanied by an  appropriate theme.",963792000,2,580,4.989583333333333
7894568,4,6305789320,"The story is based on Bolt Crank, a mercenary for hire, who was genetically altered. After eating metal objects he can reproduce them through is right hand, when ever he needs them. The animation its self is  very good, and the sound track is excellent. Only the first two episodes  are dubbed in english. The other problem is the subtitles are incomplete,  in the 5th episode the characters continue to speak, but the subs do not  continue, so unless you understand Japanese, you miss part of the story.  The subtitles return to normal in the second half of the episode.  Eat-Man  '98 is worth the money, even if you do not like subtitles.",959299200,6,640,4.610619469026549
7894569,3,6305789320,"I haven't seen this film personally, but i think what the reviewer before me means is that the movie has access to the english language (english dubbed) only in the first two episodes.  Therefore the rest of the episodes  are in ""japanese""  If the film were dubbed into japanese that  would mean the film were originally in english.  But, since we're in the  japanimation department, it would seem to me the original language is  japanese.",958348800,,439,4.773333333333333
7894570,4,6305789320,"This was a great Anime Series.  The only thing I wish that was different about the DVD version of it is that all of the episodes were dubbed.  I know its a stupid thing to say being an anime fan in all, but since  episodes 1 and 2 WERE dubbed, I think its weird watching the first part in  English and the rest Dubbed.  Oh well, thats the only problem I have with  it",956534400,,367,3.891891891891892
