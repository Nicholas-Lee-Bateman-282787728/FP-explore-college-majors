Looking into more in depth aspects to wrangle the hubby into my biz such as metalsmithing and gemstone carving.",1456012800,,275,4.52
8055578,2,B00083ZQ80,"The content of the video overall is good. Nena does a great job of walking through the steps for each project. But about 20% of the video is worthless due to the poor videography. As Nena holds up a piece to show the work, the piece is out of the frame. The entire soldering section is shot from so far away that you can't tell what she is doing. As long as you don't expect professionally shot video and sound, this DVD is right for you.",1255737600,6,438,4.104651162790698
8055579,1,B00083ZQ80,"I bought this video hoping to be able to watch and learn.  There are no close ups.  Close ups are of finish products only.  Steps by step images are much too far to actually see what she is doing.  An individual is better off buying a book with images at least you can see a close up of a ""how to image"" and what the step should look like. She does give you lots of info but video is defintely not for beginners. I did have a friend who is jewelry maker watch the video and she was not impressed.  I must say I was totally disappointed.  Not all what I expected from a how to video.",1177286400,,582,3.9316239316239314

8055581,3,B00083ZQ80,"The 3 basic projects using various techniques was very informative and well structured. HOWEVER, only a very small time of the film gives you an close up view of these techniques.  No offense, Nena, but I would rather see what you're doing than watching you talk.  I would seriously suggest firing your camera person.",1141344000,21,317,4.851851851851852
