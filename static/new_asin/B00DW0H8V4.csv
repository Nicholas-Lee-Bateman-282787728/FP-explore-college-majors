8598455,5,B00DW0H8V4,"This is a great movie.  I enjoyed it very much.  It has a great message for all the saints of God who possess the POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST.  Do not play around WITH SATAN.  YOU can and will get into big trouble like Sampson.  Stay with your kind.  Leave the world alone. Let God choose your mates and you will not go wrong.  Sampson was strong, but UNWISE!!  Ask God for wisdom and your eyes will never be put out.  Great Movie, Great Actors and Great Message!!!",1431993600,,461,4.1477272727272725
