8062640,2,B0009KA7GI,"Not going to tell you about the movies, only about color, aspect ratio and how good are the prints. All the prints are 1.37:1 (4x3).

*ABRAXAS: GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE: 1.37:1 (4x3) with lousy color and hard to make out scenes. Not sure if any of the other companies are using the same print.
*THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE: 1.37:1 (4x3) better copies elsewhere.
*FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS: 1.37:1 (4x3) but it's out on BD...so buy that! If not, the MGM non-anamorphic disc is okay.
*VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET: 1.37:1 (4X3) BETTER COPIES ELSEWHERE.
*COSMOS: WAR OF THE PLANETS: 1.37:1 (4x3) okay color and better copies elsewhere such as ""Italian Sci-fi Collection"" from Retromedia (WS in a 4x3 frame.)  DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE MGM TITLE OF ...WAR OF THE PLANETS.
*UNKNOWN WORLD: 1.37:1 OAR. Sci-fi Invasion has the best copy of this movie.
*WAR OF THE ROBOTS: 1.37:1 (4x3) okay color. Better copy on ""Italian Sci-fi Collection"" from Retromedia.
*THE PHANTOM PLANET: 1.37:1 (4x3) better copy with Image Wade Williams Collection.

If you have any of these, then don't waste your money on this. If not, it's good enough for your sci-fi collection.",1469836800,,1155,4.88265306122449
