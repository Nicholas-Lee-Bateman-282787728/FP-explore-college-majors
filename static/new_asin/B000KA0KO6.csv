8612178,5,B000KA0KO6,"This is one of Moody's Science Classics re-released on DVD.  This 28-minute video is entitled ""Prior Claim"" in reference to the many inventions of man that were first created by God in nature.  From the trap-door spider with its ingenuous trap door built into the earth to the venus fly-trap with a trigger sensitive enough to ignore a falling leaf while grabbing an insect, you will marvel at God's creative design.  The cinematography is wonderful, and I also enjoyed seeing a chameleon grab butterflies with its tongue, newborn chameleons climbing all over the place (including on a grasshopper much bigger than them), and many more things. The brief spiritual lesson at the end points out that just as God had prior claim to these inventions, he has claim to our lives, by virtue of creating us and by purchasing us with Christ's blood.

This is one of my favorite in the series.  Educational, God-honoring, and enjoyable, what more can you ask for? My four older children, ages 8, 6 1/2, 4 1/2, and 2 1/2 all loved this DVD, as they've enjoyed the rest in the series.  Hardly a day goes by that I'm not asked if they can watch one of these DVDs!  I would recommend ""Prior Claim"", and the series in general, to Christian families, especially homeschooling families.",1266451200,3,1269,4.740909090909091
8612179,5,B000KA0KO6,"This DVD is part of a 'classic' series from Moody Science which explores the created world in an intriguing and informative way. This God-honouring series welds together aspects of the faith walk with clear scientific principles, and presents a documentary relevant to both younger and older students. 'Prior Claim' uses exquisite photography to capture some of nature's fascinating creatures and plants, all of which display an inventiveness so ingenious that man has attempted to copy the structures and functions for his own use. Man's efficiency, however, cannot match God's incredible designs, demonstrated in even the most humble specimens of His creation, revealing a lesson we all need to learn - God, as our Maker, has a prior claim on our human lives.
These DVDs make science lessons in the homeschool a breeze, but they can also simply be enjoyed by the whole family, even as a visual 'devotional'. Excellent.",1223078400,,920,5.181208053691275
