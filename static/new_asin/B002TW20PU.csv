8380755,4,B002TW20PU,"I really liked this film.  I bought it originally because it was made shortly after the Troubles and depicted the clothing and equipment used during the Tan War.  Although rather predictable, I found that I enjoyed the story and found it to be one of the more interesting silent movies I 've seen, as well as one of the better early Anglo-Irish war stories.",1368835200,,357,4.5625
