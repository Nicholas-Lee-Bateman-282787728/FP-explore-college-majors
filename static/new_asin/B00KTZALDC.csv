6447641,4,B00KTZALDC,"Packaging.
The set comes ""triple wrapped. wrapping around the slip cover and two clear DVD cases that are each wrapped.
One case houses the 39 episodes of season 1 on four discs with a 5 disc containing bonuses of other TV westerns featuring Rod Cameron
The Season One Bonus Disc contains one episode each from the fallowing series.

Tales of Wells Fargo
The Men From Shiloh
Alias Smith and Jones
Laramie

Even though the DVDs are in a clear plastic case nothing is printed on the inside of the artwork.

The second wrapped set houses Seasons Two and Three on on 6 discs. Disc 6 contains the Pilot as a bonus.

Someone asked if they were in color. The few i played for a moment were Black and White and the back of the case says Black and White.
The discs house about 10 episodes per disc.
There is no play all.

There was a little bit of background hiss, but I guess that is to be expected. All and all not bad, even more so if you got in on the great pre-order price.",1411430400,16,969,4.216216216216216
6447642,5,B00KTZALDC,"Way back in May I somehow stumbled upon this in Amazon and my interest was piqued because I live in Las Vegas and had never heard of this show.
For about $8.50 on preorder I decided to give it a try. It came today and after watching the first five episodes I can say it was money well spent and would be so at the current price of $38.00.
The stories are based on true incidents from the Nevada Law Enforcement case files and are well told. Rod  Cameron does an excellent job as Nevada State Trooper Rod Blake and the guest stars are a bevy of fine popular actors.
One of the best parts is seeing Las Vegas and Nevada back in the fifties.
I highly recommend this to fans of shows from the fifties and sixties.",1411430400,19,709,4.13768115942029
6447643,1,B00KTZALDC,"cmon guys we have this already . what kinda twats are working for these bozos. cant we have some of the other ziv shows which are still unreleased such as King of Diamonds, Everglades, Aquanauts, etc etc etc etc instead of this one released over again? I would love someday soon to have a complete set of Hong Kong too but this is pointless. It will soon be in the bargain bin. Bad bad marketing",1410220800,3,395,4.28
6447644,1,B00KTZALDC,"This is a fun great show... Bit this will be a cheap Shout Knock off....And they will leave the CC Closed Caption and SDH off of it.....
So the Hard of Hearing can not watch it.....
Shout is very good at leaving the Closed Caption and SDH off of things....
They are to cheap to put it on....
So I will pass on it...

P.S.P.S.  One thing I under bout... The put CC on I love Lucy... And that was in the early 60's  And I have some TV shows & Movies from the 50's that have CC on it... It can be done....
Just a bit of time and money..",1406937600,9,533,3.7837837837837838
6447645,5,B00KTZALDC,"I previously purchased, State Trooper! Based on true cases from the files of Nevada State Police! (2010) and State Trooper - The Complete 2nd & 3rd Seasons - 65 Episodes!
Are the episodes the same are any additional episodes on the new pre-ordered State Trooper: The Complete Series???",1405987200,3,285,4.958333333333333
6447646,4,B00KTZALDC,"It's always a huge disappointment to purchase previously released products of a particular show only to see the same show be released in a more complete boxset in a superior package at a cheaper price. Last year I bought STATE TROOPER, season #1 and season #2 for a combined price that far exceeds even the Canadian price for the new product, and the cases for both seasons were so flimsy they fell apart within days, compelling me to protect the discs in makeshift envelopes. Now, 6 months later, this new product appears, which is a real rip-off for those like me who answered the siren call to buy the older product! For those who love the early TV shows and have not bought the older product, this new release sounds like incredible value! For my part, I wish there was more respect shown to customers when it comes to releasing these old TV shows, as it is NOT the first time I have bought partial releases only to see more economical & complete boxsets come onto the market shortly thereafter---no wonder so many people have such a jaded view of 'marketers'!",1405814400,22,1064,4.575916230366492
6447647,4,B00KTZALDC,"Revised @ 8/13/14: Unfortunately, the bargain price of $8.49 no longer applies but still not bad @ $33.00 for 3 full seasons.  Original: If you're a fan of police themed shows or mysteries in general or shows set in the modern west (as of the mid-to-late fifties), be sure to snap up this set at the pre-release price of $8.49.  I have the earlier Timeless release of Seasons 1, and 2&3.  The quality of the picture and sound is acceptably average.  It's the stories that count.  In most cases, the exact nature of the crime being investigated isn't made clear until halfway into the show.  Plenty of twist and turns, many times right up to the end credits (Still Waters Run Red and No, My Darling Daughter are perfect examples).  Loaded with familiar faces from the fifties as well as up-and-comers.  Makes me wish I could buy it for the first time at the current offering price.  Maybe I will, just to get those extra episodes with Rod Cameron.  Anyhow, for three seasons, it's a steal but one no State Trooper will be after you for!",1405036800,31,1035,4.516129032258065

6447655,5,B00KTZALDC,"Really enjoying this series so very much!  The stories are quite well written and cover many different situations, which gives Rod Cameron quite a variety---particularly his mode of travel (helicopter, boat, horse, foot, car, etc). Being based on actual case files makes it even more interesting because reality can truly be stranger than fiction.

6447663,4,B00KTZALDC,"Rod Cameron is perfect as Rod Blake Nevada State Trooper, using horses, cars, planes and boats to pursue criminals in this action series. The background scenes of Las Vegas, Reno, Lake Mead and surrounding Desert country show how this area appeared some 60 years ago. Many great guest stars. The Timeless reproduction of the television series is good. Sadly, the series consists of just 3 seasons. There should have been more.",1436227200,,426,5.014084507042254

6447665,4,B00KTZALDC,"State Trooper is one of three TV series that Rod Cameron starred in.  The other two series were City Detective for 64 episodes (1953 to 1955) for two seasons and Coronado 9 for 39 episodes and one season (1960/61).  State Trooper ran for three seasons and 104 episodes (1956 to 1959).  Rod Cameron was a 6 foot, 6 inch actor who was born in Canada.  He acted in ""A"" and ""B"" movies from the 1940'S through to his TV career and beyond.  Of his three TV series this show ran the longest.  It was written and produced very well.

6447670,5,B00KTZALDC,Haven't seen these in 50 years and it was great to be able to again. I grew up watching Highway Patrol and this was the other good rural police show of the mid and late 1950s.,1427932800,,175,3.888888888888889

6447675,4,B00KTZALDC,"Black and white series from the 50's.  Generally good acting.  Pretty typical of action series of that era--not a shootout in every show and therefore a little more realistic than some.

6447681,4,B00KTZALDC,"Format is very close to HIGHWAY PATROL...it's fun and simplistically '50's-style! Transfers are OK from 16mm sources...as Highway Patrol DVD's are reportedly from original MGM negatives and it shows! Splitting hairs here...the Trooper DVD's are very watchable and overall the set is a great value and a nice glimpse of the western past...Also, typical 50's Revue show with Republic Backlot close-ups mixed with on-location Nevada pick-up and insert shots.

6447683,5,B00KTZALDC,"We love this series!

It's so much better than some of the modern crime shows. It's fast, with interesting plots and characters. The crimes tend to have better twists than modern tales as well. Maybe these were ripped from the headlines at the time - and not a surprise to viewers - but some were a surprise to me. Today's shows are too formulaic and predictable.

The season also looks good on DVD.

There are a total of three seasons on this set. You can also buy them separately.

If you like Highway Patrol, definitely check this out. If you like Rod Cameron, grab Coronado 9, where he plays a PI who isn't quite as rugged as the state trooper.",1416182400,3,648,4.375
6447684,4,B00KTZALDC,"An interesting series (I like the mystery element in many stories), likeable star, and great value. Nostalgic for a period in the 50's that no longer exists it would seem.",1414972800,2,171,4.733333333333333
6447685,5,B00KTZALDC,"I pre-ordered and got the incredible deal. I'm almost finished watching the series and have enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The stories are based on facts and the quality of the picture and sound is quite good considering the program was produced more than 60 years ago. And I too recognize many of the character actors and often am able to remember their names since I was a real TV fan back then.
What I am enjoying most is that it is about a Nevada State Trooper, which I didn't remember, and I lived in Nevada my last 13+ years before retiring from an airline. I lived up at Stateline for a while and then moved down to Reno, so much of the local is familiar to me and brings a smile to me when I can see in my mind exactly some of the locations that are talked about by the characters but not always shown.
I'm looking into other old TV shows this company producers see what other old gems they are also offering.",1412899200,10,926,4.17877094972067

8661568,5,B00KTZALDC,"I had never heard of this show until it came to my email as a recommended series. Being a person that loves the old 50's shows, and already very fond of the Highway Patrol series, this set sounded right up my alley as something my husband and I would most likely enjoy. Well are very happy with this series, we are going to watch it right after I type this up, we usually watch 2 episodes at a time. I really like the ""who did it"" aspect of many of the episodes, causing us to figure out who might be the actual criminal....that always makes it fun! I highly recommend this series for old TV show buff's, the old cars and buildings alone make it fun and interesting!",1517097600,,666,4.2109375
