7891392,5,630557717X,"Wish it was on DVD, it is a very good story.  Not great, but it does show a part of society not usually visited in the movies.",1477180800,,126,3.6666666666666665
7891393,4,630557717X,"One of those small but haunting films that simply offers an unpretentious look at ordinary life and its existential pressures on ordinary people. Postlethwaite was perfectly cast for this movie. The story of a man who is floundering.  Without direction or sense of purpose, alienated from the conventional life, nevertheless true to who he is. To his character. The movie shows us why he is this way.  And the pink pylon in the midst of the Yorkshire moors is a site to behold. Haunting landscapes and domestic joys and pains. Worth the price of admission and one I was very happy to be able to see again.

A sort of Greek Tragedy from the point of view of a minion.",1441324800,,666,4.533333333333333

7891396,3,630557717X,"I watched this movie for Rachel Griffiths -- be sure to see her in Blow Dry -- but was pleasantly surprised by Pete Postlethwaite's performance. This film is a bit uneven, wandering back and forth between danger-thriller and stand-offish romance, but interesting.",1376784000,,263,5.285714285714286
7891397,5,630557717X,"I bought this movie around 3 years ago,  I thought is was a very watchable movie that takes place in Australia,  I have always been a big fan of Rachel Griffiths,  the story is where she manages to get hired on a crew of workers painting Power Line Towers that are contracted to finish the job with a dead line,  the crew is working under the table for one of the Power Company officials.  The story has a good love interest with her and the Crew chief,  has a great nude scene while on an off duty day inside an abandoned Cooling Tower,  with water dropping down on the couple from a height inside the tower,  at the time I bought this movie,  I wasn't able to get it on DVD,  I purchased a copy on VHS.  I recommend this movie for any adult to watch.",1375401600,,752,4.082191780821918

7891399,5,630557717X,"Among Giants stirred my emotions like only a few other movies have done.  Hidden deep, and I mean deep in the contrast of the yorkshire countryside and Ray's last chance at a meaninfgul relationship is the perfect view that  only a Giant could see.  By scaling the heights of the towers Ray  unconsiuosly is living his view of life:  robust with feeling, is a setting  that few others can survive in. By adding the love intrest of Gerry he  comes close to fulfilling his vision. But life is uncertain as well as  unfair.  Gerry's and Ray's emotional unfulfillemnt plays upon the heart  like a violin.  For a while Ray is at peace and like the real world life is  ""not always"" bad. This should be the case at least once for all  of us.",946512000,13,734,4.388059701492537
