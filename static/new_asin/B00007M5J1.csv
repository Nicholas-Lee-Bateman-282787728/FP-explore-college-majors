1821958,4,B00007M5J1,"The new Veggie Tales movie, Jonah, is just what you'd expect from those silly but clever creators  at Big Idea. A fun filled hour and a half serving of hilarious produce, and with a meaningful message to boot. My husband thought it was a little more along the lines of just a really long Veggie Tales video, but I on the other hand felt that the added time gave the movie the chance to really get the message across and to tell the story of Jonah in a simple but complete way. It was entertaining to the kids and grownups alike and the message of compassion and the whole story of Jonah itself was something that all of us could learn from! I gave the movie 4 stars for its ablility to use humor in an educational and spiritually uplifting way-a great movie for the whole family!",1033862400,,779,4.299319727891157
1821959,5,B00007M5J1,"I saw the film on opening night, and it was FANTASTIC.  I don't have kids... so I'm speaking for myself here.
The animation was incredible. The music was outstanding. The story was great... and of course, the Veggie characters were charming, funny, well-done... a pleasure to watch.
I took notice of the many kids in the theater... they were all bouncing, singing and enjoying themselves. They were all having a GREAT time and the film was applauded by the audience at the end.  We stayed until the very last note of the credits... and it was worth it!  The ""Credits Song"" is hysterical... we sang it all the way to the car.
For parents who want good, family entertainment... as well as want to build some moral character into their kids, this film is for you!  The lessons of compassion, mercy, giving someone who doesn't deserve it second chance... are things we all need to build into our lives.
For those families that are ""spiritually minded""... I think the overall story of Jonah should lend discussion to the fact that God is bigger than all of us. And even when we disobey His stated plans for us... He can still do what He wants and can accomplish His purposes.
It was a fantastic film that I'm certain I'll see again and again.",1033776000,34,1237,4.558558558558558
1821960,4,B00007M5J1,"I took my 3 year old daughter who is an avid Veggie fan to see the film. It was her first movie and Jonah was well worth being her inaugural film going experience. But this is far from just a kid's movie. One of the Chicago newspaper reviewers said that this was not a film for adults without children. This would be far from accurate. The movie certainly works for children, but those familiar with the Veggie franchise understand that much in the same way as Bugs Bunny, The Flintstones, and the Muppets, that much of the humor is for the adults. Silliness abounds from the opening car trip sing-a-long right through to the closing credits.
In between the opening and closing sequences Jonah: A Veggietales Movie tells a cohesive story for both the Veghead and the Veggie novice alike. Three of the main characters in the film are the Pirates who don't do anything who have a prominent part in the Veggie sing-a-long videos. However, there is nothing in the film that hinges on previous experience with Bob, Larry et al.
The film entertains and instructs. Veggie Tales are educational. They are meant to be. This film is certainly no exception. The point of this story is to be compassionate and merciful. It makes that point by telling the story of a character who was neither and a God who was both.
The story effectively segues between Veggie present and Bible past to let the modern day characters learn from the Biblical ones. I do not want to leave you with the impression that this film is merely a 90 minute flannel graph (Oooh flannel graph) for church going children. This is a fine and funny film for kids of all ages (Including 38). The animation is crisp. The musical numbers are fun and provocative.
The film is certainly suitable for all ages. My 3 year olds did find some of the sequences a little scary but thats what laps were made for. I have now seen this movie three times and it holds up to repeat viewing. Overall, Big Idea Productions has made an entertaining film that you can certainly go overboard about.",1033776000,19,2033,4.572602739726028
1821961,5,B00007M5J1,"This 100 minute VeggieTales episode comes across about as well as their version of Esther a few years ago. The animation is brilliant, the scripting great, and the music memorable and fun! (Praise for the angels singing a grand Black Gospel number.) There is heaping plate-full of silliness throughout, but many things are in the background or subtle. The character of Jonah is delivered precisely according to the Biblical story, even leaving him hanging in grief at the end when Ninevah isn't destroyed; but that's not the end of the movie. Visher and Nawrocki cleverly fold the Biblical story within a modern tale of the need for mercy and compassion. My three-year-old loved it.
World magazine appropriate complains that this movie minimizes the sins of Ninevah, similar to revision in Esther where Haman is sent to the Isle of Perpetual Tickling. The Ninevites greatest crime is smacking each other with fish. Yes, it is portrayed as a hideous evil, but I know some purists who frown on any revision of Bible stories, so I wanted to warn you. World also remarks that the Ninevites are said to be ignorant of their crimes until Jonah tells them to ""stop it."" That, too, is my only complaint with the story. It would have been just as easy to say that they knew, even in the back of their minds, that they were doing bad things, but had not been confronted with it. Still, I forgive Visher et al for this slight Veggie-tation of the real story. After all, I did learn my lesson about second chances.",1033776000,5,1502,4.693181818181818
1821962,5,B00007M5J1,"WOW! I am a college student and Veggie-enthusiast, but I must say this movie outshined my expectations! The animation was outstanding and the plot was clever and well executed. Jonah is right on target; the humorous parts will crack you up, the dramatic parts will send chills down your spine, and (of course!) the music will leave you humming for hours!
For those of you unfamiliar with the story of Jonah in the Bible, it doesn't exactly end with a fuzzy-warm-feeling. Big Idea, unlike most companies, didn't try to change the ending of the story to make you 'happy.' Instead, they found a much more story-preserving way to end on a high note by making it a tale within a tale. Thus they can help you realize that the point isn't what Jonah learned (or should I say, didn't learn), but what *you* learned.
The movie leaves you feeling happy yet thoughtful. If you watch it again, the fact that you already know what happens to Jonah only hightens the suspence, rather then taking it away.
Oh, and don't forget to stay through the credits....",1033776000,6,1043,4.643243243243243
1821963,5,B00007M5J1,"We really enjoyed Jonah!!  Our daughter is 3yrs. old & she loves the Veggie Tales!  This movie was her first ""theater"" experience, so the sights & sounds were HUGE...  It was a fun movie!  She kept asking if Bob & Larry were going to come out on stage after the show......... :)
The message Jonah sends out is also HUGE!!  I recommend all families to check this one out!  You will get more from this rated G movie than you would ever expect.
The animation & songs are great too!!  Finally a movie that can be enjoyed by the ENTIRE family!!!!",1033689600,6,541,4.297029702970297
1821964,5,B00007M5J1,"I saw a premier showing of Jonah and I could not believe the quality of the animation, the incredible music, and a very well told story. I thought every aspect was outstanding. My kids are 6 & 9 and they loved it and were singing the songs afterwards. As a dad I thought it provided positive messages I want reinforced in my children.  I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is certainly one of the the best kids movies I have seen. In fact, if I did not have kids I would have loved it too.",1033430400,50,492,4.125

1822532,5,B00007M5J1,"Children's programming with sophisticated flair.  This veggietales movie captured my heart when the movie depicted Jonah helping the enemy he believed should have been destroyed.  Contrary to popular opinion Jonah really did have an excellent reason for not wanting to go to Niveveh. The Assyrian's were known to torture their captives in cruel ways.  And, most of their captives were his people and his family.  You can mess with with me but, Don't mess with my family.  If you can imagine someone hurting your family but, you are powerless to do anything about it.  However, people want revenge but, God is more interested in reconciliation.  People want justice but, God is more interested in mercy.  This movie shows us that even the worst of us deserves saving.",1469404800,7,766,4.9763779527559056

It really is important to respect the Word of God-- and this puts it in an easy to understand, easy to entertain perspective. I have watched Veggie Tales since Rack, Shack , and Benny- and I think they keep true to their mission- letting people know they are special and God loves them very much.

Really packs a punch!

Jonah isn't the least bit interested in taking God's messages to the people of Ninevah, and it gets him into a tight spot!  The character that accompanies him on his journey is so unique in every way.  Love the accent and the family history!

My 20-something son, who is disabled, and I decided to watch it with the commentary on. It was even better, at least for adults, than the regular movie. The two guys do the commentary as characters from the movie, and start out just explaining what's happening. Then they end up trying to get each other to laugh, and finally try to outdo each other. They were hilarious! We've watched it more than once this way and it always cracks us up. I highly recommend this to adults who are tired of their kids' movies.",1461369600,,610,4.407079646017699

1822988,5,B00007M5J1,"Bob and Larry lead the Veggie-crew on another adventure - this time in forgiveness and second chances.  When Bob, Larry and the kids take a road trip to go see Twippo, the veggie superstar, in concert, Laura carrot and Junior asparagus develop a rift between themselves as Laura makes a big deal about having backstage passes, which Junior does not.  Larry and Bob end up developing a similar rift after they experience a misadventure in their van.  Their disagreements and some trouble on the road bring them to an out of the way seafood restaurant run by some very familiar-looking restaurateurs who don't seem to be doing much of anything when this wretched band of travelers walks in to their establishment.  Everyone in the group is fighting with one another, and as the restaurant managers try to work out the situation, it reminds them of a story: the story of Jonah.

From there, we launch into Jonah's tale, done in the classic VeggieTales style, but on a grander level since it's a feature-length movie.  Archibald the Asparagus plays the lead role of Jonah, with the introduction of a new character, Khalil the Caterpillar, his ""traveling buddy"" - who also serves as a kind of ""Jiminy Cricket"" conscience role.  As the classic biblical tale unfolds, it gains a new twist as Jonah boards the ship to Tarshish, which is piloted by none other than the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, serving in a game-changing role in which they actually... do something.

As the story plays out, lessons on grace and second chances are interspersed with moments of fun comedy and catchy musical numbers.  In the end, the film stays true to the biblical text and ends for Jonah's character on rather a down note, but returns to the ""real world"" characters, where Bob, Larry, Junior and Laura have all learned a vital lesson in forgiveness and second (and third, and fourth) chances.  The whole experience is then capped off by a surprise appearance that brings the show to its finale with a stunning musical number.

All in all, Jonah is a fun romp with the VeggieTales characters - it takes a slightly more serious tone with its presentation of the biblical story than some other VeggieTales shows have done, though it still manages to translate harder concepts into easier, more comical understandings.  The sins of Nineveh, for example, are reduced to fish-slapping, which still conveys the point, but in a way that is understandable.  This is definitely one to make sure you have in your collection if you're a VeggieTales fan!",1458000000,4,2522,4.837209302325581

I didn't know that this movie contained religious teaching and if I wasn't open minded and familiar with Christianity I may have been put off by it.  In the description of the movie it does not mention religion at all.  The dancing and the musicality of it keeps the story light and enjoyable.  Maybe if it said it was a religious movie I would have been more cautious letting all the children in my daycare watch it because I am legally obligated to keep ""state and religion"" separate, however with that being said, I still enjoyed the movie and made a point to focus on the ""fun of dancing to the choir"" rather than the words being said.  The music contained in this movie is excellently done.  Bravo!",1454198400,,973,4.337016574585635

I can't believe that on the description it didn't say anything about the animation being Christian motivated.  if u are looking to get your kid into Christianity, then this would be the film for you.  if you are like me and don't believe in santa claus and easter bunnies, you might not want your kid to be watching too much of this.  it's easy to tell your kid that mickey mouse is not real...but having to explain certain religious figures not being real while half the world believes in it, can become a bit challenge.  seriously, I rather have my kid watch south park than this stuff.  you actually can learn more with south park than any Christian films...lol!  this is just my opinion and yes I know...I'm gonna end up in hell unless I repent!",1389571200,,1190,4.408256880733945

1823406,5,B00007M5J1,"We're Jewish, and though Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie is produced by an evangelical Christian group, we watch it every year before Yom Kippur (when the book of Jonah is read) and at other times as well. It's a spot-on, nuanced, detailed view of the book of Jonah for any religion that takes the Jewish Bible as its base. Jonah is a big celebrity and a bit of a jerk--can't remember the caterpillar's ethnic name, complains about the palm tree dying at the end--and he never really gets the real message which is that God wants compassion and mercy to all his creatures. The songs feature details of Jewish law, ie, ""wear four tassels on your cloak"" and other details so you will live peacefully with your sheep, children, and wives. A girl in the movie wins a ticket to see a superstar in concert and humblebrags to a boy, to which the parents say, ""It's great that you've won the ticket, Laura, but please try not to brag."" We use that line whenever anyone around here brags, and it makes everyone laugh and the braggart remember not to in a light, fun way. The movie is fun and hysterically funny.",1364083200,,1097,4.49

It worked on our player, but has lines on the screen throughout the movie. Very disappointing for a brand new DVD. We kept it because I didn't want to deal with sending it back, and I just bought him another Veggie Tales DVD locally. Really a bummer since it was a gift.",1358380800,,399,4.063291139240507

1823450,5,B00007M5J1,"My two year old twins love this movie, we watch it every week. They would watch it every day if I would allow it. It shows human frality in a way that pre-schoolers can relate. It's funny, the songs are particularly catchy. It teaches Christian values. Self-righteousness, laziness, judgement, disobedience, consequences, charity, kindness, desire - all of these are covered in a way pre-schoolers can relate to. The movie holds my children's attention.  And it has references in it that parents will understand, like the theme music from Jaws, when the whale approaches Jonah or the motivational tape, Kahlil listens to when Jonah discovers him. I almost always see or hear something I didn't from the last time I watch the movie and that is something I appreciate because I watch this a lot.
It's not overly preachy for those who are not Christian or from the Jewish faith. The animation is good.  I highly recommend this movie. It has something for everyone from age 2 to 92.",1355443200,,978,4.815476190476191

1823453,5,B00007M5J1,"It's VeggieTales.  Biblical messages portrayed by animated tongue-in-cheek vegetables via physical humor, puns, and plenty of other laughs.  If you're familiar with the Veggie genre, then you'll understand that a lot of the characters are cameos.  If you are not familiar with the Veggie genre, just ignore that.  The accents are there for a reason.  One note for parents who haven't read the book of Jonah:  yes, the story does actually end this way.",1353801600,,451,5.027027027027027

1823468,5,B00007M5J1,"I truly enjoyed this DVD, because it shows everyone that having faith in God means to obey HIS every command, no matter what the cost. And even when you disobey God, he always forgives us, and gives a second chance. I am quoting my favorite song verse from this DVD which is ""God gives a second chance from all of our darkest circumstances!"". I simply love it!!! LOL!!!",1348444800,,369,4.4411764705882355

1823470,5,B00007M5J1,"I've known of the Veggie Tales for a while now - they were gaining in popularity when I was in college - but I've never been a huge fan...Until I had a baby. Watching the enjoyment in her eyes as she watches these walking (as much as a vegetable can), talking, and singing vegetables has spawned a new appreciation within me.

For the past few days, this DVD has been on constant replay at our house, and I'm still not tired of it. Full disclosure: these guys kind of creeped me out when I first saw them. Now I love them.

And I love the message in this movie, perfectly portrayed by the upbeat gospel song, ""Second Chances."" ""If you believe God's love is true, then you should know what you should do... God is a God of second chances."" I just wish more Christians lived like they believed this to be true and showed a little more compassion and mercy to their fellow man.

Jonah is a great movie - entertaining for both children and adults - with a great message. It's a favorite with everyone in our family. I can't recommend it enough!",1344556800,,1040,4.323076923076923

1823473,5,B00007M5J1,"If you've seen any VeggieTales show or dvd then you know that they take bible stories and put a kid twist on it. This is obviously about Jonah and the whale. It's a good movie and teaches that you should always listen to God and that God forgives our sins. It's got cute, upbeat, catchy songs in it like 'Pirates Who Don't Do Anything' and 'In The Belly Of The Whale'. The whole family will love it.",1342396800,,399,4.194805194805195
1823474,5,B00007M5J1,The movie is fantastic but the spanish version is overpriced lower the price soon spanish people that don't have a lot of money won't like to pay this much for a VeggieTales vhs. Could you please lower the price.,1333756800,,212,4.461538461538462
1823475,5,B00007M5J1,"I was a great lover of VeggieTales back when I was young. And I went to a Christian elementary school whilst growing up, so I was always exposed to watching them a lot. When this film came out, I could not wait to see this film. So I saw it on opening weekend, and I was not disappointed. But watching this now, I believe that this film is better now than it was then. Now I know that it's weird to say that, but this really is a well done kids film. Now this isn't really up to the majesty of Pixar's films, but on its own, it really is good. And being a teenager, I have a great soft spot for this film. I know that there are some people who say that the CG animation in this film isn't as good as Pixar's animation, but come on people. Nothing will ever beat Pixar or even compare to Pixar. But on its own, the animation for this film is pretty good. The songs are... actually really catchy. Especially that Second Chances song that may leave you humming for a while. ""It cannot be"" is actually a very powerful and somewhat emotionally fueled song that is quite moving and kind of dark in a way. Speaking of dark, this film is dark in a way. There are some really dark, powerful moments in the film. One scene is when Jonah is in the whale and he states that due to what he has done, he's going to die in the whale. In my opinion, that really is a very poignant and powerful scene. The characters are good too by the way. I know that there are some people who do not like Khalil the worm or caterpillar whatever you want to call it. And he is annoying to an extent, but there is something about him that is likable. Overall, this film is very clever and entertaining. It doesn't go too far in being preachy, but it gets the job done and you can feel the passion that went into the film. I really do believe that this film is as good, if not better, than it was 10 years ago. It's not a perfect film, but is is a perfect family film for everybody to watch.",1332288000,2,1958,4.062015503875969
1823476,5,B00007M5J1,Although the movie doesn't deliver a completely accurate rendition of the story of Jonah it does a nice job keeping kids entertained and giving them an idea of who Jonah was and why he was in the belly of a fish.  It will take several times watching this for them to grasp this concept but that won't be a problem as they really enjoy the characters and base story line.,1323648000,,370,4.285714285714286
1823477,5,B00007M5J1,"At first, I have to admit, I was wondering, ""Where are they going with this??"" Is the bus going to dump them in the water and then a whale snatch them up???

1823478,4,B00007M5J1,"My only complaint about this movie is that it is not as attention-getting and attention-keeping for my toddler as the other VeggieTales ""shows.""  I think the way the shows are broken up into segments helps, but this is definitely more of a movie format - with only one story.",1307232000,,275,4.612244897959184

This fits perfectly, especially if you are looking for a Christian-tilted selection. VeggieTales do a great job of conveying the Bible and Christian concepts in fun ways.

It is clever and funny and highly entertaining, but most importantly, tells why we need to have compassion and mercy for our fellow man. The main example of compassion and mercy in the movie is God's for the people of Ninevah. No greater example could be set. I am trying to teach my three year old that we do things because Jesus expects it of us and it's the least we can do to honor His sacrifice for us.

The animation is much richer than in previous Veggie Tales videos we've seen, with a 3-D quality and good sound track that made it especially enjoyable to watch. I also liked the fact that this animated movie follows the actual story of Jonah in the Bible fairly closely, with the exception of the fish slapping, which was bizarre and hilarious if not factual, and the Pirates who don't do anything, who added a lot of color, laughter, and life to the story even if they are two thousand years ahead of their time.

1823515,5,B00007M5J1,"With so many really bad CGI (computer graphics imagery) shows and movies out there, it's refreshing to see a great film made by people who obviously love what they're doing. The story of Jonah and the whale is told, or rather re-enacted by the pirates that don't do anything, who in 2008 came to theaters in a new Veggie movie. This story within a story is funny and fun, light hearted, told and animated with a light, sure touch. Even the opening credits are funny, but stay for the end and the ""Song Under the Credits"", a zany, light-hearted finale. The songs are as poetic as Godspell, and the film is far above the lesson- laden kids' shows that drag down so much of current kids' fare.

Some will dismiss this movie as religious moralizing, but by being up front about its message, normalizing it, as it were, the result it fresh and effervescent. Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly, mused Chesterton. These veggies are good for you, but they take themselves far more lightly than the bulk of kids shows. If laughter is the best medicine, the prescription is Veggie-Tales.",1205280000,2,1094,4.668393782383419
1823516,5,B00007M5J1,"This was my first Veggiefilm I saw and the reason I'm a fan. You can really tell that it's been more work put into this film than the shorter ones. The characters are believeable, and the graphics is what to be expected. But the absoluitely best part is the songs.

A friend of mine, who's not a christian, heard the soundtrack to this movie and was impressed. The quality is to be compared with the big smashhits from Disney (and with me being a big fan of Disney mainly because of the music, this really says alot!) You can follow the story simply by listen to the music, and they are really catchy.

In this film, the humor that is present in all of the Veggiefilms have been taken up a notch. All of the films are funny, but this one is hillarious.

And the big underlying message (which is not so underlying)? That everybody deserves a secound chance. Before I saw this movie, I haven't thought of this story this way (call me stupid, being 24 and all...). The miovie has something to say to everybody. From the kids who's not willing to forgive their friends for doing something stupid, to the grownups in church who believe they are better that everybody else, not willing to see that neither themselves ever can deserve the grace of God. And finally, to the non-believers it tells the story of a God who gives a secound chance, no matter how ""bad"" you are, and no-one else believes you should have it.",1199318400,,1409,4.4324324324324325

Plot: Junior Asparagus, Bob The Tomato, Laura Carrot and others get side tracked while traveling to a music concert and end up meeting ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" (Pa Grape, Mr Lunt & Larry the Cucumber).  While the waylaid travelers argue about whose fault it is that their VW minibus has a flat, the Pirates relate a story to teach them about mercy, grace, and forgiveness.  This is where the Bible story of Jonah is told, with the Pirates as the sailors who attempt to take Jonah (Archibald Asparagus) to Tarshish while he is running from God (who wants Jonah to goto Ninevah and tell the Ninevites to repent).  Eventually Archibald arrives in Ninevah and preaches his word of repentence - only to wait outside the city waiting for God to destroy it, not understanding that when the Ninevites repent, God immediately forgave them of their past sins.  Just goes to show that that man often doesn't understand the workings of God - we are all for vengence when we see wrongs, but are we so easy to forgive?

Although there are liberties taken to spice the story up a little, the message is the same.  You and your children will both laugh through the whole movie AND be blessed by the message.",1173916800,,1470,4.648648648648648

1823528,5,B00007M5J1,"First, I will mention that I am a Veggie fan. However, this movie is great even if it is your first exposure to the Veggie Tales characters. My brother-in-law watched this when we gave it to my son for his 3rd birthday. I don't know if he had seen any VeggieTales before, but he said, ""I had no idea they were SO FUNNY!"" My son had already seen the movie (we checked it out from the library), but we all loved it so much, we just had to own it.

The songs are great! I love the soundtrack CD, which we also own. My son loves to sing the songs and dance around. My husband thought it was great that the movie points out that Jonah ""never really got it."" In this sense, it stays true to the story and goes beyond many children's Jonah stories, which seem to end after Jonah ...um... exits the whale.

Make sure you listen to the songs that play during the credits (both songs... and listen to the lyrics!), because the fun and humor continues. Also, find the outtakes, which require you to look in the special features on the DVD.

In theory the message of mercy & compassion seem like positive messages but unfortunately the message is twisted. Are they teaching children to have mercy for hmmmm... say privileged drug addict politicians, but not for incarcerated people of color on death row? Was not Jesus on death row?

Also, for a show that would sound to parents like it would promote vegetables & healthy eating, they sure do glamourize cheese puffs!

Furthermore, for a movie that is historically inaccurate; cheese puffs, a pirate ship, with motor etc., they decide to include text about ""your wives & sheep"". So it is sexist to boot!

The VeggieTales crew dealt with all the important details of the story, and pointed out that Jonah never really did understand God's mercy.

The songs in the DVD bounce me out of my seat.  I challenge you to remain seated when the Gospel song ""Second Chances"" comes on.  Wow!  I think that is my favorite from the movie, but there are several close seconds.

1823539,4,B00007M5J1,"""Jonah:  A VeggieTales Movie"" is a grand little film.  I had always been aware of the Veggies, but being the almost thirty man that I am, I never paid much attention to them.  With this film, I've been shown the err of my ways.  My three year-old daughter handpicked this film for us to watch, and I'm completely hooked now.

""Jonah"" is a hilarious tale that is perfect for every member of the family.  It retells the Biblical story of Jonah and how he and the people of Nineveh are given a second chance by God.  It also teaches viewers the same thing with the interaction between the Veggie characters.

The animation is wonderful in this film.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and is loaded with humor for both young and old.  The songs are brilliant and somewhat addictive.  The opening sing-along is very, very addictive.

Extras on this two-disc set include a making of feature, ""Jonah and the Bible,"" a tour of Big Idea studios, and music videos featuring Chris Rice and Christian rock heavyweights, Newsboys.  There's also trivia, bios, karaoke, and a ton of other things to keep the whole family busy.

Non-Christians may have a problem with this movie and its message of compassion through God.  If that's the only thing keeping you from buying this movie, shame on you.  There is so much here for children to learn, and it is presented in a wonderful, colorful adventure.

1823542,5,B00007M5J1,"The question is, ""What can I say?"" Even for a Veggie Tales movie, I love taking it in with my little girl. I do not get sick of it, not at all. And it is well worth the lesson learned throughout the film. I think it is just as entertaining as ""Harry Potter"", which I refuse to watch, or even read for that matter. The people behind Veggie Tales are just awesome, because they are not looking for credit, and they deserve a lot. They do so much for God's kingdom! They don't ask for the world, yet they reach the world, and this generation of our children, and even some of the adults who need a wake up call every now and then!
I love how they made someone such as Archibald Asparagus the character of Jonah. But yet it still has Larry the Cucumber, Bob the Tomato, Pa Grape, and even a silly caterpiller to stick with Jonah, almost all the way! The song at the end (Jonah Was a Prophet) should hit home with everyone, not just as a ""lesson"", so to speak, but also as a song of fun and entertainment. All of the songs are wonderful, as the movie begins strictly on a fun note with ""Billy Joe McGuffrey"" and everyone cutting up and just having a blast in the van on the way to the Twippo concert. It also it gives me a very sobering look at myself and how many second chances I've had in my pathetic life! Yeah, I actually admit that! I've come a long way in 29 years. God is so good to us, let's not take that for granted. That's another thing that this movie very strongly states. (Don't you get it?!) I still have a long way to go.

Yes, Jonah gets swallowed by the whale for not doing what god says and is given a second chance. He meets up with a little friend who is half worm half catapillar named Carmichael.

1823545,4,B00007M5J1,"While I usually love Veggietales, this particular movie had a lot of flaws. It was too long, in my opinion, to hold a kid's interest; and it started off too slowly (I was bored within ten minutes, and I am someone who usually laughs out loud and sings along with the videos). The other problem I had was the ending of the Jonah story--the movie winds up to its resolution and just ends with the statement, ""Jonah never really got it, did he?"" and a song that repeats that theme. I think their first full length movie would have been better suited with a more uplifting story!
However, as always, the movie is full of jokes and sight gags, cute songs, and a positive message, along with the biblical story. I would recommend it, but only for older children.",1077840000,2,756,4.446043165467626

Their hairstyles and dress remind you of the more richly pigmented members of this society, and when they start singing, they look and sound for all the world like a black church choir.  That one scene is the one I always think of from this movie.  When my son watches the video, I will often come in and watch it during that scene.  I absolutely LOVE it!
I think they captured the personality of the Biblical Jonah fairly well with Archibald playing the lead.  While they tell the Biblical story of Jonah, they dress it up with aspects of the Veggie Tales assortment of characters that make it quite entertaining.  The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything actually do, in this video -- they are participants in the story!
The best things about VeggieTales are all there, only moreso in this movie length presentation.  The jokes for the parents are there in full force, so we adults can enjoy it along with our children.  I recommend it highly.",1074556800,3,1097,4.527918781725888

1823550,2,B00007M5J1,"I appreciate Big Idea's attempt to make excellent children's movies that are pro Christian in their values.  Veggie Tales are well done, humorous, and inventive, but unfortunately the feature film Jonah misses the mark when it comes to communicating the Christian message.  The story is based on the Bible's rendition of the Story of Jonah.  To Christians the Bible is the Word of God.  However early in the story we are treated to a song and dance routine that mocks the ""Message from the Lord"" as irrelevant and frivolous at best.  Jonah spouts out such statements as ""don't eat bats don't eat pigs"" and ""don't do drugs, stay in school--I message from the Lord.""  I feel that this trivializes the very core of Christian doctrine, that God has revealed himself to us through the Word of God.  The ""message from the Lord"" is the heart of our belief and not a trite and meaningless sound bite.
As the movie goes on Jonah confronts the Ninevahites for thier sin of slapping each other with fishes and encourages them to start being nice to each other.  Again Big Idea misses the heart of the message, for the people to turn from their wicked ways and give the Lord their worship.
The Christian community is frustrated with the lack of Christian friendly programing.  With Disney making movies celebrating animism (Lion King), ancestor worship (Mulan), Indian tribal religion (Brother Bear), and taking a good Christian character in Pocahontas and making her a pantheist, Christians are looking for alternatives.  I feel that the blatant errors presented in the aforementioned Disney flicks are far less dangerous than the more subtle undermining of Christian doctrine in Jonah.  For a truly Christian movie try Finding Nemo.",1069632000,6,1722,4.944444444444445

1823557,4,B00007M5J1,"The heart of this Veggie Tales movie is the telling of the story of Jonah.  While Jonah is inevitably associated with the ""whale"" (actually ""great fish"", from the Hebrew ""Dag Gadol""), there's a lot more to his story than that.  The story is set out with delight and with humor.
  One problem the filmmakers had to work around is that they did not want to make God (who has a fair amount to say in the Biblical book) a character in this movie.  They get around this quite well by putting His words in the mouths of other characters.  This does lead to a slight weakness near the end (Chapter 4 of the Biblical book) which, in the Bible, is heavily devoted to conversation between deity and prophet, and leads to the lesson in compassion which concludes the story.  There is simply no way to reproduce God's unanswerable statement which concludes the book; the moviemakers settle for spelling out the lesson in compassion.
  Reasonably faithful to the Bible, there are some delightful moments--as when the sailors cast lots to see which among them has offended his god--the lot falls upon Jonah through playing a dramatic game of Go Fish!  And, as Jonah floats in the water and the sailors try to rescue him, the moviemakers show great sense of humor and cinematography, as tension-filled music is heard, and a wide shot is maintained--showing plenty of ocean shortly to be filled by Jonah's swallower.
  There is a slight Christian emphasis (mostly through the repetition of the ""God of the Second Chance"" and ""mercy"" themes, which, as it is not overt, should not present a problem for those of other faiths.
  Kids and adults should enjoy a good story here, and the latter should admire the techniques used to tell it!
  Well recommended.",1061078400,3,1738,4.724252491694352
1823558,2,B00007M5J1,"This otherwise superb Veggie Tales film is ruined by its ending.  What the Big Idea people purport as a ""Biblical"" story is in fact, in its ending, nothing at all like the ending to the story in the Bible.  Creative license is one thing, but when you are teaching values to kids from sacred religious texts, you need to have a more faithful (pun intended) adherence to the source.
My kids watch Veggie Tales quite often; we own many of their tapes and DVDs.  But my kids don't ever ask or choose to watch this Jonah movie.  They've told me, ""What's the point?""
You see, this movie's ending is a complete downer.  In a very real sense, it creates a bit of an existential problem for the young viewer.  I have seen children struggling to understand why this ""man of God"" should be so much weaker and have so much less faith than them, and then, in the moment when they are happy for him because he's ""finally come around"", he fails miserably for them because he just doesn't ""get it"" the way they do.
It's basically an attempt by the Big Idea people to create some dramatic irony; and it's just put in the most inappropriate moment possible for this movie.  The kids who understand better than Jonah do not feel better about themselves or empowered or wise; rather, they are frustrated and confused because a character they've been identifying with for over an hour has suddenly just fallen off the deep end of understanding... and the kid is left with this nagging little fear (which one of my children expressed to me) that says ""maybe Jonah has good reasons for not understanding... maybe God was wrong...?""
Thank you, Big Idea Productions, for plopping that discussion into my lap.
So, if you are going to show this movie, just be prepared to do a LOT of talking with the little ones when it is over.",1060646400,3,1802,4.50920245398773
1823559,5,B00007M5J1,"Big Idea Productions yet again has produced a fantastic story, lovable characters, and outrageously silly songs-- but this time, it's a full-length feature movie! The story begins with Bob the Tomato, Dad Asparagus, and four veggie kids on their way to a Twippo Concert. However, Bob runs into some trouble with the van, leaving them stranded at a seafood (or ""seafoo"") restaurant. From there, they meet ""The Pirates who don't do anything"" (played by Pa Grape, Mr. Lunt, and Larry the Cucumber) who tell the story of Jonah to the vanful of grouchy veggies. Now Jonah (played by Archibald Asparagus) was a stubborn prophet who refused to tell Nineveh (the ""bad"" guys)to ""stop stealing, stop lying! and especially, stop slapping people with fishes!"" Instead, he decides to run away from Joppa and flee to Tarshish. However, God has another plan in store for Jonah, and Jonah soon finds himself in the belly of a whale. After spending three days and nights in there, praying for God's forgiveness, the whale heaves Jonah back onto dry land, and Jonah gives the message to Nineveh.
  I thought it was a splendid movie that has a great lesson: that everyone deserves a seond chance. Just like other Veggie videos, the score and songs are top-notch, and the gags found in Jonah are so hilarious at times, I fell out of my chair. (""What? They were fresh when we caught them... two weeks ago!"") The animation (thought not quite Pixar... yet) is very crisp and clear, especially on the DVD version.
  Like most other Veggie DVDs, this DVD comes with bonus materials. But unlike other Veggie DVDs, this has a disc just for bonus material! In the 2nd disc, you can learn how the movie was made, how the score was written, and a lot more!

As in the Veggie tales videos and DVD's, the songs are catchy (in fact, they stick in your head like glue), the storyline is humorous and the Veggietales folks manage to teach a good lesson. In this case, the moral is that God is merciful and compassionate, that we should be the same, but Jonah just ""didn't get the point"" (he wanted God to destroy the Ninevites(sp), and in fact, was looking forward to witnessing their destruction). The Jonah tale ends just as is does in the Book of Jonah; my son had seen me reading the Bible, requested to see the Book of Jonah (thanks Veggietales people for inspiring him), and the Bible indicates that Jonah does not repent and show compassion towards others. Not a happy ending, which is why the Veggietales people probably wrapped the modern-day plot around it and ended the movie with a big musical number.
  My four-year-old has been watching the DVD almost every day and
has learned what ""mercy"" and ""compassion"" mean. In fact, this past Sunday was the Feast of Divine Mercy, and sure enough, when
the priest made the announcement during mass, my son picked up on the word ""mercy"" and related it to the Jonah DVD.
  We also enjoyed the second DVD; I especially enjoyed the studio tour and my son and teenage daughter liked the outtakes.
  In summation, I'm glad that we added this movie to our DVD/video collection. I just discovered Veggietales a couple of months ago (I checked  a few out of the local library). I wish I had known about the series 10 years ago, when my two teenagers were younger.

If you check your Bibles, the story of Jonah ends with God explaining to Jonah why the city of Ninevah was not destroyed (Our God is a God of second chances: when the people of Nineveh repented, God forgave them).  Veggietales added a whole musical number about Jonah not understanding.  The Bible does *not* say anything about Jonah ""never getting the point"" of the story after God explained it to him.
I believe that Jonah understood after God explained it to him.  After all, he was accustomed to talking to God as you or I would talk to a friend, so why not wait for an explanation.  I have a child named Jonah, which makes it worse.  I want my son to believe that he is capable of learning to forgive, and I don't appreciate him or his sister singing ""Jonah never got the point"".

1823575,1,B00007M5J1,"In northern Iraq, in the town of Mosul (much in the news of this writing) is the El Ahalaham mosque. About 50 feet under the mosque is a limestone sarcophagus that contains the mortal remains of a Jew, Jonah son of Amittai.  Nearby are the vast, mud-covered, largely unexcavated ruins of ancient Ninevah, once the greatest city in the world and the capitol of the bloody Assyrian empire, the ruthless enemy of Israel and Judah.
The talking vegetable stars in the CGI animated JONAH: A VeggieTales Movie trivialize this story about apparently real events and people from 775 BC.
The real story has a reluctant prophet who i s compelled to deliver a final messaage to a wicked city: repent or be vaporized.  Jonah hates the enemy so much he runs away.  Maybe he knows God to be merciful and fears that the cruel regime in Ninevah will repent.  Unfortunartely, you can't run away from God, so when strange curcumstances alow Jonah to be swallowed and and then spit up by a great fish, this astonishing story spreads throughout the land.  Perhaps years later, when Jonah finally reaches Ninevah where the people worship a great man-fish god, they are ready to believe Jonah becuase he himself came out of a supernatutural fish-god and thus Jonah is trustworthy as God's spokesman.  Why else would they even let Jonah in the gates?
And to Jonah's chagrin, God shows mercy to these bloodthirsty pagans.
Incidentally, around 765 BC, according to ancient records in the great library at Damascus, Ninevah became for a period of time monotheistic.  Amazing, if you think about it.
An animated Jonah could be a great project.  This version is simplistic and borderline stupid. An insult even to kids.

There, they meet the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.  Sensing that the group needs a lesson, they proceed to tell the story about the one time they did do something.
Seems a number of years ago, they met up with the prophet Jonah.  When he didn't want to follow an assignment from God, he tries to run away on their boat.  But will God let him off the hook that easily?
Once again, the guys at Big Idea have created a wonderful film that everyone can enjoy.  Heck, I saw it twice in the theater myself.  They stick pretty close to the Biblical story while still throwing in the silliness that we've come to expect.  While one or two parts may appear over the top, they work for this movie aimed at pre-school kids.  Especially effective in getting their message across is the ending.  By including the entire Biblical story, they make an excellent point about compassion and mercy that we all need to remember.  Their animation, while not up to the bigger budget of Pixar, is the best I've ever seen them do.  The water shots are amazing all by themselves.  They've certainly come a long way from their first video.
This DVD set is loaded with lots of fun things beside the movie.  The first disc features the movie in wide and full screens.  Full screen is the default on this disc, but it's easy enough to go into the menu and change it.  This disc also features three audio commentaries.  Phil and Mike do their usual entertaining job of giving insight into the making of the film.  The second commentary from producer Ameake Owens and director of animation Marc Vulcano is just as enlightening.  Of course, the third commentary, from Larry the Cucumber and Mr. Lunt, tells us the real story of what happened in the making of this film.
The second disc gets into all kinds of bonus features on the making of the film.  Everything is covered from conception to rendering to music.  While I have a fairly good idea what goes into something like this, they approached it in a different way that shed new light on it for me.  They also have some hilarious features.  I was rolling at the outtakes, and the Easter Eggs are well worth finding.  They also include the videos and some (but surprisingly not all) of the animation for the Jonah sing along video that came out before the movie.

1823578,5,B00007M5J1,"This movie is loads of veggie fun for everyone. A fresh re-telling of the classic Biblical story of Jonah, the prophet who ""never really got it"" when running from God, told by The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, the lazy threesome of pirates who, as you may have guessed, don't do anything. They fondly recall, however, for Bob, Junior, Laura Carrot, Junior's dad, and a a couple more veggie friend, how they once DID do something.
The scene shifts from the seafood diner on the riverbank to ancient Israel, where the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything met Jonah, the prophet who delivered God's messages to the Israelites, until God gave Jonah a special assignment: Go deliver His message to the Ninevites. Jonah certainly did NOT want to do this (Everyone knows that Ninevites are fish-slappers!)
Jonah enlists the Pirates - desperate for money to buy Mr. Twisty's Cheese Curls - to take him on a cruise in the OPPOSITE direction. God's not foiled however, and they encounter a great storm. Everyone knows the rest of the story. Jonah is thrown overboard by his own request, and a great fish (pleasantly yellow in the film) swallows him. After receiving the Second Chance message straight from God's angels in the belly of the great fish, Jonah repents and sets out for Nineveh. In spite of the fish-slapping, cheese-curl theft accusations, and a pesky yet lovable caterpillar (okay, so he's only have caterpillar), Jonah works his best to obey God's command.
This movie, while spicing it up with lots of laughs and kiddie fun (Jonah uses a duckie float when thrown off the ship), the film teaches important lessons. You can't run from God, and God gives EVERYONE second chances.",1047945600,3,1675,4.839721254355401
1823579,4,B00007M5J1,"My kids and I are huge VeggieTales fans, but I must admit that I was just slightly disappointed with ""Jonah"" when we saw it during its theatrical run. How could I not be? Expectations run pretty high with VT, and the prospect of a feature film raised the bar that much higher. However, while not as funny as some of the home video releases, repeated viewings have allowed this film to grow on me quite a bit.
The great detail and care that went into the look of the film is very apparent on this DVD. The animated menus are gorgeous and offer entertainment in their own right. The inclusion of both widescreen and pan-and-scan on the same disc doesn't reveal many compression artifacts in either transfer, but it does bother me that widescreen is not the default and that to select it I need to navigate through 3-4 menus. It's a minor quibble, but I wonder why they couldn't offer the viewing options once ""Play"" has been selected as with other films. Viewers need to be educated on what widescreen is all about. The 3 included commentaries are a mixed bag. The first, with Nawrocki and Vischer, is entertaining in their (un)usual goofball boys' club kind of way, but also manages to provide some insight into the production as well. The second, with producer Owens and animation director Vulcano, is probably the best of the bunch as they stick mostly to technical details and shy away from the goofiness. If it's total goofiness that you're looking for, however, you can't go wrong with the third commentary by the characters Larry & Mr. Lunt. I haven't been able to get through much more than 15 minutes at a time because it's a bit strange hearing the disembodied character voices ad-libbing about everything under the sun knowing that something will eventually stick to your funny bone.
Disc 2 contains just about everything else. Informative behind-the-scenes features, a funny tour of Woolworth's... er, the Big Idea studio, and a Biblical history of Jonah. The music section is good and even contains unadvertised extra videos from the Newsboys and Chris Rice. The ""outtakes"" are funny, but not as much as Pixar's. All of the bonus materials are good and informative, but I sometimes wished that they went a little more in-depth. Don't get me wrong, they've packed so much stuff on here that compression artifacts are very noticeable throughout. However, in their effort to include something for everybody, they've had to skimp a little on everything.
All in all, this is a great first feature effort from Big Idea. The movie is beautiful, stands up to repeated viewing and there's enough bonus material to keep you busy for days. There are a few minor issues, but it's better than most releases. Don't throw this one back; it is definitely a keeper.",1047859200,3,2759,4.7740585774058575

These are very much historically innacurate, but hey we're supposed to be having fun.
The story is very good and sticks with the orginal ending. Jonah didn't get it. Most stories of Jonah end with him getting it or with the Ninevahites repenting. Many lack the fact that Jonah never really got the lesson about mercy. I think more people in the world including myself need to learn show real mercy to people who despise us or hurt us.
The DVD is packed with extras including commentary by Larry and Mr. Lunt. This alone makes the DVD worth the price. To hear them comment on football fields, Krispy Creams, and how they are the actual producers (actually they were the writers and directors) is very funny. I also like the outakes and the music videos by Newsboys and Chris Rice. And remember that God wants everyone to have a second chance.",1047600000,,1160,4.425233644859813

1823583,4,B00007M5J1,"If you are already a VeggieTales fan you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD.  Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie is the first VeggieTales movie that was released theatrically.  And the CG animation for Jonah is head and shoulders better than the videos VeggieTales has produced so far.
The story of Jonah (played by Archibald Asparagus) is very true to the Old Testament book and even includes the same rather puzzling ending.
The story doesn't hold many surprises for those familiar with the Bible story, but their are a sufficient number of additional characters and plot points to make the story interesting even for the Biblically literate.
Jonah can get preachy in parts, but I think succeeds in treating the story with a healthy irreverence.
But, the DVD extra features makes this a must have for your collection.  The quirky ad lib dialogue for the animated menus can be down right hilarious and usually at least humorous.
The folks at Big Idea Productions put a lot of effort into making the DVD features and it shows.  Some of the extra features include a behind the scenes tour of Big Idea Production (FYI they are located in a shopping mall), Videos for the Newsboys, Chris Rice, and Superchick, and a hilarious look at some of the Dailies highlights some of the rendering difficulties they had during the production of this movie.
Also, if you buy the DVD you will find out what words like dailies and rendering means!",1047340800,,1418,4.799180327868853
1823584,1,B00007M5J1,"This movie was not the best it could have been, not by a longshot. the biggest reason is simply because the writing of the story was weak. The characters were belittling, annoying and at the end the whole moral of the story was negated by the narrarator. The bible and the story of Job is full of strife, drama and trials of life. The story of Job is not a placation to the parents of Christian children who want to feed their young palatable stories that can be easily referred to in Sunday school.
Example; the next time your best buddy chastises you during and after your wreck your car full of children see how easy it is for you to forgive him. I would think that most (self respecting) people would say: ""Take a long walk home... ya pickle!""
Big Idea made this movie for 13 million. The box office take was over 26 million. Add sales with this DVD, video and other merchandise and it is safe to say that we will see another animated movie coming from Big Idea again. Hopefully they will learn from the modern masters at Pixar and Studio Ghibli that the story is the foundation that  the rest of their craft is built upon. The bible is rich with stories of morals, human endurance and experience. Let's see if Big Idea can pull a better rabbit out of its' hat next time.",1047254400,6,1275,4.334728033472803

I would have to say that the DVD release is the most feature-filled package I've ever owned or rented!  This thing is busting at the seams!  3 commentaries (including a hillarious character commentary track that will have parents and older children rolling on the floor), a great studio tour by Phil, outtakes and rendering error... you name it!
The movie itself was really good itself.  Jonah is a hard story to follow, and if you're not christian and you're shocked by the religious content - hey, it's Jonah.  I mean, c'mon...  You're watching a bible story and you're surprised by the religious angle?

1823588,3,B00007M5J1,"_Jonah_ was my introduction to the ""Veggietales"" universe. Alas, it's not one of the little legumes' best efforts. Bible stories tend to be very short, and children's adaptations of these stories are best when they keep to an hour or less (as most ""Veggietales"" videos do).
At 83 minutes, this retelling of ""Jonah and the Whale"" is thoroughly padded. The pacing is sporadic at best, with lots of puerile sermonizing, and most adults will be bored to tears. The target audience of children may also be confused at the strange ending -- though, to be fair, even the Veggies admit they don't much like it. (As someone who takes a more sympathetic view of Jonah, I think Veggietales is unfair to the most successful Biblical prophet on record, but their interpretation is very much in keeping with the mainstream of contemporary evangelical-Christian interpretations.)
The film itself is best suited to children ages 4-8 from evangelical households. If you're not Christian, you'll find _Jonah_ deeply offensive -- one musical number (in gospel style!) features enough crosses to line the Appian Way. (As Robin Williams remarked in _The Birdcage_, ""Are we crucifying someone tonight?"")
The DVD's numerous extras run the gamut from kid-friendly karaoke to extensive technical commentaries. It's an excellent edition of a so-so film.

That's also why I was so disappointed when it wasn't up to par.  The movie was over stuffed with effects and under scripted, heavy on the Sunday morning values and light on the Saturday morning fun.  It seemed like Big Idea was just rushing to get out their feature film and forgetting what makes a feature film feature-to the whale with quality control!  Veggie Tales had always been bouncy and happy; but this was slow and in some places (I'm sorry to confess:) it was boring.  The camera was slow; the music was slow; and the jokes were gone.  They missed so many opportunities for a laugh; if it wasn't so sad, it'd almost be funny-disappointing.
 I thought I'd never give Veggie Tales a three star review; I believed in Big Idea; and actually, I still believe in them!  (I watched the movie; it was about giving second chances;) And I believe they can do better than this I hope they learn from their mistakes like with Easter, move on, and write another movie better than ever.

You'll probably even be singing the Veggie Tale theme with the kids before it's over with and enjoying contemporary Christian music (gasp!)about becoming fish food in the belly of a whale (Trust me, I never thought I'd be listening to contemporary Christian music! Which I don't but I had fun with this with my son)
The characters are great fun - it's made more fun because each of these characters are portrayed by Veggie regulars who have characteristics that shine through the role. It's kind of like John Wayne playing a role as a politician. Even though he might have been able to go through all the actions and do a decent job acting out the part, he still would have been The Duke. Well Jonah is still Archibald the Asparagus, and the pirates are still Larry the Cucumber, Pa Grape, and Mr. Lundt. The only exception is Khalil who is new and isn't even a plant, but we can forgive him for the fun he brings to the show.
The most important aspect of the show as a parent though is that the movie brings a great message to your child. It is definitely Bible based but brings the basic message that people need to forgive and accept each other. This is a message that any child can hear regardless of your religious affiliation. I'm trying to bring my son up on this kind of thing. He couldn't tell you who the Road Runner or Wile E. Coyote is but hopefully he can share some of the messages he has learned from watching the fine entertainment that Big Idea has brought us. My son loves watching these videos he'll laugh, sing, and dance while they play and instead of getting the idea that it is fun to blow each other up with dynamite or other ridiculousness like that, he is learning valuable lessons.
Kudos to Phil Vischer and everybody at Big Idea.

So is the type of movie you go to. With all the vulgar language in movies today, I don't understand why ""God"" is so objectionable even to you. I also don't understand why people go to a movie knowing that they are probably not going to like it (if they learned anything about the movie first) just so they can put it down and try to convince everyone there's something ""wrong"" with it. In my opinion, there is much ""right"" with it. It shows the virtues of kindness and compassion. How can any moral person find fault with that? And despite others opinions, it's not in the least ""preachy"". It's light and fun and very entertaining. My husband and I took our 3year old daughter to it and she LOVED every minute of it. Also, someone mentioned that a person can have morals and values without believing in God. I believe this is true, but I also believe, as many do, that without God, there wouldn't be morals and values, and these concepts originated not only in Christianity, but many other religions. This is a wonderful family movie. Bigidea should change it's name to ""Great""idea. After all, God is great.",1046563200,12,1266,4.532751091703057

As for Jonah,  I am so pleased that kids can enjoy it and receive some moral values at the same time; especially great was the fact that the movie competed quite well with the ""big boys"" of Hollywood.  Way to go, Mike, and all the other extremely talented people at Veggie Tales.  My favorite Veggie Tale is the one called ""Are you my neighbor?""

""The Star of Christmas"" that just came out on DVD last month is considerably better.  The ultimate critic was our small son who is normally mesmerized by the Veggie Tales.  He grew restless watching this movie.  Bob the Tomato has just a minor roll in the movie while Larry the Cucumber has a slightly larger part but is still not the main character.  I think that is why my son grew bored.  I give it the movie an average rating at best.  My personal recommendation is ""The Star of Christmas"".",1039996800,3,646,4.229508196721311
1823599,3,B00007M5J1,"I expected little from Jonah. Instead, I was impressed.
The religious element I expected. I mean it is about Jonah, a key story in the Old Testament. Jonah was marketed as a religious story for little kids, and I think Big Idea accomplished exactly that.
But I expected an awful movie made by wannabes. Not so. It was a solid movie with room for improvement. I'd see it again.
The Veggie Tales shorts I've seen over the last five or six years are funnier, and the songs are better (""I Love My Lips,"" ""The Bunny Song""). That's tough competition though, as the Veggie shorts are some of the best in children's videos, and their songs are classics in waiting.
Negative
The voices didn't match ""Toy Story"". The characters weren't as good as ""Beauty and the Beast"". It was not as funny as ""Aladdin"". The songs not as cool as ""Jungle Book"".
Positive
The backgrounds were intense. The subtle jokes slipped in are best I've seen (pay attention Python fans). The plot was well developed, and carries well throughout the movie. Very funny closing credits. And, the pirates were funny. Also, I think more than other popular children's movies, there is plenty for parents to discuss with their kids afterwards.
The movie has done far better than anyone expected, and they did it with limited marketing, no famous names to sell the toon on Leno. No famous musicians to get the songs on pop radio.
I saw this flick on the Sunday afternoon after Thansgiving Day, long after its release. The room was packed with little kids who laughed. They loved the movie, and they are the market, not me.
Choosing the recommendation level is difficult. For me, it is three stars, but for the second grader behind me singing ""We are the pirates who don't do anything"" as he left, he might give it five stars.
I'm looking forward to the next Veggie movie, and am intrigued to check out their ""3-2-1 Penguins"" series.

If you haven't yet seen or heard VeggieTales videos on the small screen, or hummed away to their accompanying CD's, let this outstanding film be your introduction.  In previously released videos, the VeggieTales ensemble of animated vegetables (yes, that's right!) retain their personalities while acting in little ""moralty plays"" about the everyday problems that we all face, often with biblical parallels. The music in these videos is beyond outstanding with extremely clever, often touching words and complex, ingenious and lush orchestration.  ""Jonah"" amplifies these qualities.
""Jonah"" is the only movie in my memory to which I could give my highest recommendation to ANYONE, of any age.  Please  go, enjoy and see what true quality is on the big screen.",1036713600,9,1008,5.229813664596273
1823601,2,B00007M5J1,"Whether you'll like this movie or not depends on who you (and your kids) are.
If you're already of fan of VeggieTales stories, and you have a high tolerance for Christian proselytizing (even the bland kind that turns complex and often disturbing Biblical stories into happy-face Sunday School mush) and your children are easily amused by mediocre animation (i.e. either very young or rather dim), you'll be happy.  Everyone else is likely to find this tale boring, baffling, and just plain disturbing.
Boring because in 85 minutes there are few memorable songs or even scenes that anyone over the age of 6 would enjoy.  The strangely amputated vegetables (if you're going to give an asparagus a pair of eyes, why deny it a pair of arms and legs so that its forced to hop along on vegetal stumps) lack a full range of expression necessary for truly engaging animated characters.
Baffling because - other than one lonely little carrot in the sidebar story - there is not a single female character in the entire picture.  Of course, it's a Christian tradition to omit or erase female existence, but apparently the male animators, in their all-male imagination, have no qualms about offering little girls a universe in which their gender is utterly invisible.

If that's not disturbing enough, the cheery vegetables and their wacky adventures cloak a sinister message that compassion toward others can only be obtained through the worship of a supernatural deity.  How many parents want their children to believe that they are incapable of kindness toward others unless they're supplicating some god?
Not that this god is even rendered faithfully.  The Christian movie-makers rightly concluded that the true story of Job -- wherein God, engaged in a pissing contest with Satan, green-lights the murder of Job's children - would send an audience of 6-year-olds and their parents screaming for the exits, thus we get this whitewashed God-as-loving-father advertisement in its place.  So much for accuracy from `the-Bible-says-it-so-I-believe-it' crowd.
In other words, if you have no qualms about sitting your kids in an all-male revue where cartoon character sing Christian ditties denying that decency and civility are possible without god-worship, you'll have a great time.",1036195200,16,2270,5.185792349726776

It is interesting to note that as of Today Jonah is beating both Michael Moore and Madona's new picture, who says that virtue doesn't sell?
The one complaint that can be made about this movie is the quality of the graphics compared to other animated features, however this picture has nothing like the budgets of those others and it still flows fine.

The videos not only give God's message in a way that little children can swallow, but sometimes as a young adult with a past of staunch religiousness to live up to, it helps me to understand my faith better to see it through the eyes of a child (or indeed, an asparagus).

(And if you think I was embarrassed buying a ticket to ""Jonah"" the weekend that ""Red Dragon"" opened, well then...you're right) The film was stunning. It holds true to the unique (although some call it Pythonesque) style of the videos but does not depend on the videos for enjoyment. It is original, charming, bright, and Sherlock Holmes couldn't find a hint of dysfunction in the whole eighty-some minutes.
On the way to a concert, the car breaks down and driver Bob the Tomato and navigator Dad Asparagus get help in a nearby seafood restaurant. But the real tragedy is Laura Carrot has lost the backstage pass she won out the car window. Now, Junior thinks this is great because she was being mean and flaunting it. At any rate, Junior encounters three ""questionable"" characters who call themselves ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" (See ""Very Silly Songs"" or ""The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown"") played by Pa Grape, Larry the Cucumber and Mr. Lunt. They tell a story about ""that time when [they] did that one thing with that one guy."" This turns out to be Jonah (played to perfection by that green fleshed rival to Sir Lawrnece Olivier, Archibald Asparagus) who is adamantly against delivering God's message to the Ninevites who sin and curse, and even slap people with fish! (A Python reference? Most definitely) So he and the Pirates sail in very much the oposite direction, until a storm makes it apparent that God is very upset with one of them. So Jonah heroically hurls himself into the sea where he is promptly eaten by a whale. The theme is Compassion and Mercy and to remind you that no matter who you are or what kind of aquatic animal you like to slap people with, God says you are deserving of a second chance. I won't tell you how the concert goes because that'll ruin the movie, and I won't tell you how Jonah gets out of the whale because...well, frankly, you should know. It's a very well known story.
What struck me the most was the sheer scale of the project. It wasn't just like watching two and a half Veggie videos back to back (which is not a bad way to spend an afternoon). It was instead marvelously independent of the tapes.  With camera sweeps and set designs that wouldn't feel out of place in the latest Pixar/Disney joint.  Film students would find nothing wrong with the structure and pace of this cinematic marvel. The characters filled their parts the way we say sitcom actors embody their characters (and maybe it's stupid to say that the performances were good when the ""performances"" were just voice actors and cartoons, but every slight detail on Archibald's face was carefully designed by the animators to convey a specific emotion and I think the mission was meliphluously accomplished...unless I spelled it wrong). The music was not merely up to Veggie standards, it was simply marvelous. From the childish medley about ""Billy Joe McGuffrey"" to the Gospel choir (for my money the first reference to African-American culture in the series. Correct me if I'm wrong) singing about a God of ""Second Chances"" to the ""Silly Songs with Larry"" vein of ""The Credits Song"" it was all I could do to run to a shop and buy the soundtrack (a college man has to eat, you know). The end credits also featured a song called ""In the Belly of the Whale"" performed by Christian rock group Newsboy, which is probably a nod to the Disney tradition of an End Credits Theme. Even the presence of the clearly one hundred percent clownish character of Khalil the half caterpillar/half worm salesman with a regional accent that makes Babbu Bhatt from Seinfeld look like an Oxford English scholar could not take away from the quality of the experience.
So I urge you, Protestants, Catholics, Methodists, Christians, Baptists, Quakers, the lot to take your children, your wives or your sheep to see this movie. (You probably won't enjoy it if you aren't of the faith, because it does come pretty directly from the Bible, but if you can be patient through the religous references and stick around for the fun, go for it!) Don't just go because your kids want to go. Go because it's a funny movie, it's a good movie, it's got a good message and you'll leave feeling pretty good about a thing or two. This is the kind of movie that people need to be making more of and it's the kind of movie people need to be watching more of. I'd see it again in a minute.
I just love those veggies!",1034640000,87,4973,4.599099099099099
1823614,3,B00007M5J1,"I took my 4 and 6 year olds to see the movie.  They are definitely veggie tales fans, though not huge fans, so I thought they would love it.  They both liked it ok, but I expected them to be laughing and smiling all the way through.  They weren't.  I heard them laugh only a handful of times.  The movie was way too much like a religion lesson to be greatly entertaining.  It was sad and scary in parts and talked about dying and death - just like most bible stories.  Unfortunately, most bible stories are too scary for young children.  Personally, I wish Veggie Tales would do more stories about telling the truth, sharing, etc. than retelling of bible stories.  All in all, an ok movie that I think would be GREAT for religion teachers to use in class, but just average in terms of family entertainment.",1034380800,6,806,4.391891891891892

My friends and family love the Veggies.  However, none of us are able to SEE the Veggies!

1823619,5,B00007M5J1,"This movie is a MUST SEE for any Veggie Tales fan!!!
The Veggie Tales series has captured the hearts of kids (and adults) with more than a dozen different videos. Each about 30 minutes long, and now Big Idea Productions has gone all out to create the first ever full length Veggie Tale motion picture. And as with all the previous works, this one is full of what fans have come to know and love. State of the art computer design, memorable music, a lesson in faith and general silliness that makes you laugh out loud.
The animation is truly fantastic and a delight to the imagination. This film abounds with cool details and effects, especially with the pirate ship, the storm at sea and movements of the armless veggie characters. Big Idea did a great job in illustrating the story of Jonah. Very thorough, clear and kept consistent to the Biblical story. Expertly telling it with their classic twist of humor, making it unique and a completely unforgettable.
Watching the Veggies on the big screen, in a dark theater with total strangers gave me mixed emotions. To see such a film, in a public setting, that praises God in a ""no-bones-about-it"" sort of way, did create a weird feeling, but at the same time it was refreshing experience from the norm. Defiantly worth the ticket! And in my opinion it is one to be watched twice. Don't miss the boat!

1823622,2,B00007M5J1,This movie may be okay for some very young children. My eleven year old was miserable most of the time and my five year old was moderately entertained. The music and the songs were ordinary and simple; nothing to hum home afterward. My husband and I were disturbed and bored and we found it overly religious and preachy. The dialog and song lyrics of the talking vegetables really gave me the creeps. The intended lessons were too forced and overstated. This is something that would be appropriately aired on one of the religious television channels...,1033862400,4,552,4.821052631578947
1823623,5,B00007M5J1,"After anxiously awaiting months to see JONAH: A VEGGIETALES MOVIE, I am very happy to say it was more than worth the wait. VeggieTales videos first came out a few years before TOY STORY and though it may never be acknowledged in entertainment circles, Big Idea is really the innovator of computer animation. Anyway, the people at Big Idea have taken their art to a new level and it is amazing.
JONAH tells the story of the Biblical prophet by the same name. Jonah is a prophet of God, living in Israel. God tells Jonah to deliver a message to Ninevah, the capital of Assyria.  The Assyrians are the most hated nation on Earth at the time and are enemies of the Israelites. Jonah doesn't want to do what God tells Him and runs away and his flight lands him in a whale of trouble. Unlike most tales of the story, the VeggieTales JONAH tells the complete story of Jonah, even tying in complaints many people have about how ""incomplete"" the Biblical story is.
The animation in JONAH is top-notch, on par of SHREK or MONSTERS, INC. I've seen all the Veggie videos and I was amazed at how brilliant and vivid the characters and scenery were. Granted it's less difficult to create vegetables than Ogres or Monsters, but the Veggie gang seemed truly lifelike.
Kids will love this film, even if they have never seen a VeggieTale before. However, many adults (if they put their cynicism aside) will delight in this film as well. VeggieTales, like the Muppets and the Simpsons, works on several levels of humor and there are many jokes that children just won't get. For example, watch for references to Monty Python and WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.
Overall a great movie that children will love and that adults will probably enjoy. The movie has a great message about compassion and mercy and that's something everyone could learn a lot more about. Big Idea Productions are engaging culture in the way it should be done and it's worth one's time and money to see what they are doing.",1033862400,5,1982,4.614730878186969
