8484143,4,B005R5DWEE,A good review of skills but fails in presenting basic setup of equipment,1440028800,,72,4.615384615384615
8484144,2,B005R5DWEE,"This DVD is basically DIR skills shown how to work with Sidemount systems. They do not talk about different harness and wing systems (other than the UTD Z System), how to set up stage bottles, how to properly weight and trim a system, etc. I'm glad I rented this for $1.99 instead of purchasing.
While the skills are important and need to be constantly refined, it passes all the basic equipment and setup information.

Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to start side mount diving.",1424822400,,505,4.738636363636363
8484145,4,B005R5DWEE,I found the skills presented to be done so with good examples and the explanations were very clear.  This is a good way to help keep your skills sharp.,1367884800,,151,4.206896551724138
