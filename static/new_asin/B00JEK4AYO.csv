8650282,5,B00JEK4AYO,"This video is an absolute treasure of vintage Balanchine. The most priceless item on the video is probably ""Concerto Barocco"" with Tanny LeClercq and Diana Adams. LeClerq's career was tragically cut short by polio so clips of her dancing are few and far between. This ""Concerto Barocco"" has 6 corps women instead of the standard eight (probably because of the tiny studio) and they are wearing black leotards instead of the white dresses. But other than that, this is recognizably the same beloved ballet. LeClercq is absolutely beautiful and she and Diana Adams make a great contrast. They are similar in height and build but LeClercq's style is graceful and soft while Adams is severe and geometrical.

Adams is also featured in ""Agon."" Balanchine famously designed the central pas de deux for Arthur Mitchell and Diana Adams because he wanted to contrast their skin tones. This idea might seem offensive today but in the 1950's to design a sexy, provocative duet between an African American man and a white woman was considered very shocking and avante garde. But this early video of Agon shows how this ballet has changed over the years. The central pdd between Adams and Mitchell is much more impersonal here -- over the years, it's become more intimate and tender. Here it seems like a rather cold mating ritual, which was what Balanchine said was the original conception.

The Pas de Dix with Maria Tallchief has been previously available. Tallchief, who is broad-shouldered and square-torsoed doesn't fit the stereotype of the Balanchine ballerina. But you can see in her a regal, stern quality that few of Balanchine's later muses had. As he aged, he seemed to like his girls thinner, more feminine. The choreography is heavily based on the Petipa Raymonda.

Finally, the Nutcracker pas de deux with Diana Adams and Nicholas Magallanes is the only video document we have of Balanchine's choreography for the Cavalier variation. He cut it in later versions. Adams is also rather regal and cool as the SPF, but it's interesting to see Balanchine's first thoughts on the pas de deux. In general this version is familiar to anyone who's seen the final thoughts, although the sliding contraption is not there.

These videos are really a wonderful resource for anyone interested in NYCB's first generation of dancers. They worked with Mr. B in his most productive years and yet they are often forgotten.",1455494400,4,2406,4.977611940298507
8650283,5,B00JEK4AYO,"I am very glad that the George Balanchine Trust allowed this series - New York City Ballet in Montreal, Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 (so far) - to be released on DVD. And I can certainly say that Volume 2 is a great addition alongside the others.

The filming for this was done in black and white. This didn't bother me, though it might disappoint others. Despite some blackness and it being grainy, I found it easy to follow the dancers movements in every performance on this DVD.

The first piece is Balanchines Concerto Barocco, with music by Bach. I already loved Bach by the time I got this DVD, so all I needed was for Balanchine to impress me with his choreography. He did! The choreography is stunning - there are fast turns, fleet footwork, etc. The cast is superb, led by Diana Adams, Tanaquil Le Clercq, and a young Jacques DAmboise. All three artists prove how great they truly were in this piece.

The second piece is Pas de Dix, from Balanchines Raymonda Variations. Having seen full length versions of Petipas Raymonda by then, I was interested in what choreography Balanchine would do. Like Concerto Barocco, he did not disappoint me. The splendid choreography is executed very well by Maria Tallchief, Andre Eglevsky, and the other dancers. As for Glazunovs music, it is beautiful to the ears.

The third piece danced here is Balanchines famous Agon. When I first found out what Agon was all about on the Internet, I instantly wanted to see it performed. The performance here is spectacular! No one out of the 12 dancers present disappoints you! Most ballet fans will probably be able to pick out Diana Adams and Arthur Mitchell in their famous pas de deux, yet another Balanchine ballerina - Violette Verdy - is also in this.

This leaves us with the final piece - the Grand pas de deux from Balanchines Nutcracker. With Tchaikovskys glorious music soaring around them, Diana Adams and Nicholas Magallanes dance beautifully, a picture perfect couple, a king and his queen. The only thing that drove me bonkers is that during the coda, while Diana and Nicholas were still dancing, the credits began to roll. I wish they hadnt done it like that - it destroys what ballet fans are trying to watch, which is the dancing.

Overall, this DVD feels like it was somewhat of a Diana Adams tribute, but other than that, I loved it.",1450051200,,2334,4.6392251815980625

8650285,4,B00JEK4AYO,"This was a big surprise. Nothing in the advertising that I recall told me that these are vintage recordings. Obviously, these works were digitized from the original videotapes and the grainy quality could not be brought up to today's visual standards. At first this disappointed me; but then I realized that these are actually valuable records of the early performances of these classic works. Diana Adams and even Tanaquil LeClercq are actually hefty compared with the later muses of Balanchine's genius. The performance levels of the dancers are more rough-hewn than long-time followers of Balanchine might recall. The stiletto precision of today's performers is not present in these vintage works. It makes me wonder if Balanchine's original genius was more inspired by particular, breathing people than by idealized mannequins. I think that this tape would be a big disappointment to a general audience fan expecting to see the crisp abstraction of Balanchine's later performance versions. But dance students and historians will enjoy this archival record. It makes one think about the ephemeral nature of ideals.",1418601600,10,1117,5.388571428571429
8650286,2,B00JEK4AYO,"I loved watching this DVD except throughout I was irritated by the blurriness of the image. I realize the technology was not up to par in those days, but if someone could figure out how to clarify the gorgeous dancing, I would bump my rating up to five stars in a heartbeat.",1401753600,10,274,4.288461538461538
