770752,4,6304017782,"I enjoy hearing about the gimmicks William Castle used in his horror films.  For ""The Tingler"" every few seats in the theater were rigged to vibrate at certain times so that its unlucky occupent would feel a tingling sensation and think they were being attacked by The Tingler!  (This was called Percepto.) There's also one scene with a lot of bright-red blood (the rest of the picture is in black and white).  And near the end of the movie ""The Tingler"" finally attacks YOU - the audience! - and you must listen to Vincent Price's instructions or you'll never be rid of it!
The DVD includes a nice little 15-minute or so behind-the-scenes look at the movie, featuring Darryl Hickman (Dave).  His recollections of William Castle and the plastic Tingler creature used in the movie are especially funny.  There's also the drive-in version of the narration in the scene where you are attacked by The Tingler.  And the trailer is fun to watch.
If you like this, go out and get ""13 Ghosts"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" - and pray that they don't try to remake any more of these movies!",1006473600,5,1079,4.59375
770753,5,6304017782,"To call William Castle's ""The Tingler"" cheesy would be an oxymoron. William Castle made cheesy movies that flagrantly thumbed their noses at common sense and believability. They were brazenly ludicrous ""B"" films that didn't pretend to be anything else (like ""The Sixth Sense""). However, ""The Tingler"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" both starred a class act, Vincent Price. Mr. Price took hammy acting and transformed it into performance art. The scene in ""The Tingler"" where he has a VERY bad acid trip defies description. My friends and I screech with laughter just thinking about it-Vincent was great. The fact that William Castle couldn't possibly explain how his screen villains pulled off all of their ""scare tactics"" on their hapless victims doesn't matter-they are so SHAMELESSLY UNBELIEVABLE that you have to laugh-and you do! ""The Tingler"" looks and sounds great in the DVD format-and the documentary about this camp classic is extremely enjoyable-Darryl Hickman, in particular, is quite charming and funny. ""The Tingler"" and the original ""House on Haunted Hill"" are must-have DVDs, if you are a fan of silly and enjoyable horror flicks. Hooray!",976838400,,1151,5.260869565217392
770754,2,6304017782,"I'm a Vincent Price fan, but this is one of his lesser works, in my  opinion.  The script and storyline are ridiculous, even for a B-picture.  Still, Price's charm and superb acting save the film, as do several  unintentionally funny scenes.",968025600,3,241,4.804878048780488
770755,5,6304017782,"I saw this movie on TV when I was about 6 years old and it scared the hell out of me.  Horror movies haven't really scared me in a long time but I  still think this one is way cool.  The premise of this film is completely  absurd, yet wildly original.  I almost want to call it surrealistic.  Vincent Price is at his very best in this one as he switches from being the  kind, gentle voice of reason to the witty, sarcastic, vengeful husband of a  cheating, cold-hearted woman, and the calmly deranged doctor who is  obsessed with the phenomenon of being scared to death.  Price makes the  many facets of his character's personality blend  smoothly, giving him the  quality of a very subtle madman.  Fans of Vincent Price know exactly what  I'm talking about because nobody can do this as well as he could.  There's  something about the combination of William Castle and Vincent Price that  really clicks.  My two favorite Price films are this one and House on  Haunted Hill, which were both directed by Castle.  It's a shame they didn't  work together in more films.  I really can't say enough about Vincent Price  or this movie.  If you're into this kind of stuff, you need to have this  one in your collection.  You will want to watch it again and again.",967766400,10,1256,4.466666666666667
770756,5,6304017782,My brother and I watched this movie 2 or 3 times when we were little. It was a classic horror film. Not one of the more popular and was rarely shown. It is a great flick. The concept scared me then. I bought it for my  brother for Christmas 30 years after we had first seen it.,943056000,7,277,3.8596491228070176
770757,5,6304017782,This is one of my favorite William Castle films. The quality is outstanding and the added features and widescreen are a bonus. A must have for any 50's horror fan.,941500800,4,163,4.466666666666667
770758,3,6304017782,"Not bad. Another in William Castle's Ed Wood-like attempts to be the Alfred Hitchcock of Horror (I refer mainly to his cutesy ""host"" duties).
The story centers around a coronor's attempt to discover why he  finds spinal cord injuries in people who are scared to death. Turns out  there is a microscopic organism that rapidly grows around the spine when  people get scared. Only screaming can prevent the amazingly strong creature  from crushing the vertabre. Once you scream, the creature reverts to it's  microscopic size. This is what explains the ""tingle"" in the spine  when you're scared, hence the name of the creature, the  ""Tingler"".
In the course of his experiments, Vincent Price  removes a Tingler from a victim and it gets loose in a movie theatre. This  is the perfect opportunity for Castle to ask movie patrons to scream...  literaly.
This movie was the one whereby Castle had movie theatre seats  ""wired"" to a device that would give electric shocks to viewers  when the Tingler was on the rampage.
Entertaining '50s camp with Vincent  as a hero instead of a villian.
****NOTE: The movie the patrons of the  theatre are watching is a silent film called ""Tol'able David"", a  well renowned 1921 film about a young lad who takes up delivery of the  mail, and meets up with evil crooks.",925603200,21,1296,4.796380090497737

He got so involved and had so many gimmicks going on around the films that that was what the fans got into.  He takes a story like this that is just so so as horror films go and turns it into a cult classic.  He spent more on his presentations of his movies than he did on special effects.  Like he only had one of these rubber lobster type Tingler made and pulled it around on strings.  He didn't pay much to the actors to be in them, they just loved to work with the man.  Picture the smooth and sophisticated Vincent Price working with a sloppy William Castle.  Price had a great sense of humor and enjoyed Castle's enthusiasm.  Castle wasn't above using Darryl Hickman's girlfriend in the movie to lure Hickman into the film.  When Hickman questioned who would believe him as Price assistant, Castle said, ""Nobody!"" then asked why he was even in the film Castle told him, ""For the teenagers!""  This is just a standard B film that was made something special by Castle's enthusiasm.  He even used electrically wired seats in the theater to buzz a few people during scary scenes in the movie and who can forget the ""Scream!  Scream for you life!"" sequence.  Storyline is shaky as if has a doctor finding that people have a Tingler growing on your spine during intense fear and that screaming makes it go away.

771646,4,6304017782,"The great William Castle--what can I say? Whether its HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL or THE TINGLER, Castle had a knack for making memorable shlock horror films. Memorable because they had some genuinely creepy moments mixed with popcorn-throwing at the screen hilarity!

OK- so everyone has this Tingler thingie hanging out in their spines. Terror makes it grow to the size of a 2-pound Maine lobster, and it will eventually kill its host--unless the stress can be relieved by SCREAMING!

As science fiction, this is a pretty good premise. If you remember your high school biology, the microscopic paramecium has a similar dilemma. When stressed out, the paramecium shoots out these pointy things called ""tricacysts""  and impales itself from the inside out. Too bad this single-celled little critter can't scream out (or throw popcorn) like you and me!

Old weekend hippies will roll with laughter when Scientist Vincent Price injects himself with 250 micrograms of LSD-25 (which he purchases at the local pharmacy). Here's the dialogue-

Handsome young doctor's assistant- Hey Doc, be careful with that stuff, will ya? It's pretty powerful.""

Assistants lovely girlfriend- ""Just what does that drug do?""

Handsome young doctor's assistant- ""It's not really a drug. It's an acid. And it causes the user to experience wide-awake nightmares"".

I won't spoil anything for you. Let's just say that Vincent Price and a first-rate B-cast of  character actors take drive-in movie horror to a new level of hilarity. Interestingly enough, the B&W cinematography is pretty good and looks amazingly good on a HDTV screen.

THE TINGLER is silly, scary, funny and laugh out loud entertainment from a far more innocent time back when. Check it out--if you dare!",1392163200,4,1739,5.178571428571429

He seeks to capture one and also to find out the pain tolerance threshold.  Yes, it sounds ridiculous.  The special effects are second-rate and the acting aside from Price and Hickman are average at best but it works.  Price's delivery of his corny lines with his style and panache carry this film.

771761,3,6304017782,"If anyone was the master of acting in the horror film genre it was Vincent Price. It almost seems he was made to star in those kind of movies. Price certainly made some classic horror films in the 1950's including ""House Of Wax"" and ""House On Haunted Hill"". Another one of those classic horror film from that decade is ""The Tingler"". Mind you when I call this horror this is nothing like the horror films of today. By todays standards the horror films back then would be considered way too lame now, though anyone who was a kid back then would tell you that those movies probably scared the crap out of them. ""The Tingler"" would no doubt be considered lame as well maybe even thought of as being a little hokey. But it is a good hokey because Vince Price and his usual outstanding performance makes the movie worthwhile to watch. No matter what kind of part he is playing Price is believable in that roll and that is what makes a bad Vincent Price movie so much better then most of the movies that are being made today.

In a nutshell Price plays a doctor who trying to understand how fear affects the human body. He discovers there is a creature inside people, called the Tingler, that grows when we feel fear. It will continue to grow the more fearful you get and the only way to kill the beast is to scream for your life. Price then meets a man who's wife is a deaf-mute. Unable to scream Price wonders what would happen to her if she became scared and the tingler started growing in her. Turns out she scares very easily and is murdered by being scared to death. Price takes the murdered woman's body and operates on it to remove the tingler. Don't want to say more so not to ruin it for anyone who has not seen the film but just to say the tingler gets away (like you couldn't guess that would happen) and enters a packed movie theater where everyone is told to scream for their lives.

I would not rate this as one of Vincent Price's better movie but it is still a hoot to watch especially if you are like me and love watching those old classic horror films. I remember as a kid myself being scared by this movie and enjoyed every minute of it. When I watch ""The Tingler"" now I can't believe I could have been scared by such a hokey movie back then but I still enjoy watching every minute of it now.

With campy tongue firmly in cheek, it features Price as a pathologist who theorizes (and proves) that fear is a creature that crawls along the spine. Only screaming can disable the centipede-like ""tingler.""

Price's LSD experiment on a deaf mute woman (who obviously can't scream) causes the rubbery little critter to emerge from her body. He manages to capture it, but the thing escapes, much to our delight.

A great audience participation gimmick, explained on-screen by the garrulous director, probably sent viewers home with strained vocal cords.

Some years later, co-star Hickman, who hams it here for all he's worth, admitted he was embarrassed to appear in this odd picture.

771847,4,6304017782,"It would have been easy for the audience to view THE TINGLER in 1959 as just another zero budget non-thriller, but fortunately for movie lovers, director William Castle had Vincent Price play the lead. Price, with his six feet four inches that accentuated his gravelly voice, had made a career of portraying villains of various stripes, with each villain forcing the viewer to join in the cacophony of death that inevitably accompanied his demise.  Price here is a pathologist who has spent years performing autopsies on executed criminals.  He discovers that intense fear causes a microbe to grow on the spine to such a length that its powerful pincers can crush one's spine in the moment preceding death.  Now this may sound like the malarkey that it truly is but in Price's capable hands, the viewer does not doubt for a second the reality of the scene.  Director Castle uses some weird Gothic camera work to showcase how a deaf mute woman cannot scream, thereby insuring the growth of the Tingler within her body. The Tingler itself is, of course, utter nonsense, resembling a creepy crawly centipede with mandible-like pincers.  In more than one scene, the sharp eyed viewer can actually see the string moving it forward.  But Price is the dramatic center, holding audience interest as he sweats and groans in a manner that has long since been his essential screen persona.  Price has several little known but effective supporting actors, all of whom know when to allow him to occupy center stage.  Especially effective is Phillip Coolidge in the creepy role as the husband of the mute woman who has the startling ability to surprise us with an unexpectedly rich complexity to a role that is more than it seems.  Creepy is the best single word descriptor for THE TINGLER.  In this case, creepy is fear that only an old pro like Price could generate.",1289433600,2,1854,4.82018927444795

Yeah, Vincent Price proves again what a fine actor we was, and is the star of the film, but I really enjoyed Philip Coolidge's (Ollie) performance. As for Price, watching this other day made me scratch my head and wonder how such a good actor could play in so many cheesy films?

Whatever, those two along with Patricia Cutts (the tramp wife), Judith Evelyn (Ollie's deaf-mute wife), Darryl Hickman and Pamela Lincoln all did a pretty nice job, although Price's acting talents stand out among the cast.

It also would have fun to see this in the theater 50 years ago when they rigged the seats to tingle during certain scenes! That really happened! Director William Castle really tried everything to get the audience. He even stopped the film and asked the audience to scream! It must have been hilarious.

You can see the wires and the Tingler looks like some kind of a worm but it didn't matter to me since I found myself enjoying it especially considering the time it was made.  There was another really great part where color was used and it fit perfect and I would say it is probably my favorite scenes from the movie next to the pitch black theater.  If you are a fan of Vincent Price or fun old horror flicks I say watch it at least once and see what you think.

The special features though not many are nice to have and the sound and video of the movie is kind of what you expect nothing great but not bad or ugly.",1230508800,,1330,4.041984732824427

It has everything you want to make you scream- including Vinny Price's voice commands, towards the end, to scream.  (This film, perhaps my favorite Castle production, was producer Castle's next horror project after ""The House on Haunted Hill""...also very scary.)

You'll want to watch this cult movie classic in the dark... turn out all your lights, grab some popcorn, and prepare to scream!  The tingler monster is totally cool (with tentacles, lobster-like body, and cute lead wires)!  The wide-eyed, screaming voice, tingler-chasing acting is brilliant (the actors certainly had fun making this one) and frightening.

The motion picture presents in monochromic black and white, except for the bright red blood- just too cool!  Fiend flick fanatics will love this movie, particularly the final 10 minutes, beyond words... with screams all around!  Be sure to watch the ""Special Features"" portion of the 1999 DVD- it adds to the mayhem (and helpfully explains ""Percepto"").

It had already played in the larger cities and those of us in small bergs had to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for it to get to our town.  I stood in a long line to get tickets that first day as it played, a matinee.  A whole row of girlie gigglers, we peeked between our fingers at scene after bloody scene, screaming and screaming.
Now the movie could be considerd schlock.  But it is schlock at its best.  If you want to have a scream--and a laugh, pick it up in time for Halloween.  Vincent Price doing some of his best work--but the Tingler is a real scene-stealer.",1220832000,,949,4.114130434782608

The idea here is that the tingling feeling we get when we are scared is not adrenalin after all, it is really a lobster growing on our backbones. The creature is called, surprisingly enough, the Tingler. The Tingler would continue to grow until it killed us, except for the fact that it dies (and apaprently also disappears) when it hears a scream. Pathologist Price is on the  hunt to be the first to capture this creature (and with no regard for the safety of anyone). Some of the characters in this film are stranger than the Tingler - especially the owner of the movie house and his wife. Might be a little necrophilia going on here behind the curtain. Price's cheating wife is also a jewel - I'll bet you can't guess what happens to her... There is also an interesting gimmick with the film's original release, one that is fully explained in the DVD, but unfortunately not one we can share with the theatre-going audience.

The Tingler is everything a good schlocky spook show should be.  Price is a coroner who does research on the side involving fear and what causes us to freeze and go rigid when frightened.  He refers to this force as The Tingler, and discovers that it may be an actual, physical being.  He goes through numerous experiments in his attempts to learn more about The Tingler, and isn't above some pretty unorthodox methods.  He threatens to shoot his unfaithful wife to try and get her to the peak of fear, he trips on LSD(which he gets via prescription.  LSD was actually used for medicinal purposes at this time) to spook himself, and finally gets a stroke of luck when he meets a deaf mute.  You see, The Tingler's effects are broken if you scream, because screaming breaks the tension.  But a deaf mute can't scream!!!  This enables Price to obtain his own Tingler which looks like a big rubber lobster/centipede hybrid.  It turns out to be indestructible and too hard to handle(like The Black Crows), and gives Price a wake up call about delving into such matters.  Then the Tingler gets loose and runs amok in a movie theater.  Sound like fun?  It is.  The science is completely absurd, but when has that ever been a problem?  Price seems to really be enjoying himself and as usual turns in a great performance, especially in his tripping scene.  A classic for a good reason.",1205539200,,1497,4.592452830188679

""The Tingler"" is a creature which feeds on fear. That's it. That's the basis of the whole film. And Vincent Price is always great in a film with a scary theme. Even in this one, which features acting that's not always great and a monster which is just plain... well... silly .... at times, Price carries off his role. It's not his fault the monster looks like some sort of half baked centipede or something.

What makes this 40th Anniversary edition so fun are the add ons, features that show just how good Castle was at promoting movies.

Now being autistic and disabled I had lots of hospital visits growing up so medicine, doctors and the mysteries of the body was never far from my mind.

Seeing and hearing about the Tingler made my little kid skin crawl.  Add that to the human skeleton coming out of that water in House on Haunted Hill and this dude was set!  My grandmother left a closet door open that had dry cleaning on it and in the bright moonlight night the plastic reflected the moonlight.  From my vantage point it was just enough to put me in mind of the bones and tingler dude had a Nightmare so bad my parents insisted I stay home from school that next day.

Oh I look at Tingler now and laugh a little but, there is always that place inside me where the Tingler made its mark.  I have watched thousands of horror movies since first seeing the Tingler and I laugh at most of them no matter how gore filled they are.  What made Tingler so good was not the monster.  Tingler has a strong psychological horror story sub-plot attached to it.  Tingler made me think about the nature of fear and its effects on the body.  Another thing that just creeps me out is that Tingler has strong Film Noir elements that just makes even its most outragous moments feel just a bit too real.

Vincemt Price was at the top of his form in Tingler.  For an old Movie Tingler still has its bite.  This film would have just been another bad B horror movie had it not been for the serially creepy intonations and hard psychotically mad doctor ghoulish features of one Vincent Price.",1185494400,2,1702,4.294670846394984

Instead, let me just say that if the reader of this review is a fan of Vincent Price and especially, Director William Castle, then you will want to go get the ""40th Anniversary"" copy of this film.  The extras, especially the short film on Castle, his films, and the promotional gimmicks that he used to sell them is great.  But, back to this film....

""The Tingler"" is one of those great old black and white films from the '50s that many Baby Boomers grew up with.  Price is terrific as always and is surrounded with a solid cast of method actors.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the ""Tingler-animal""(?) is certainly hokey (and has it's exposed wires for propulsion in plain view), but that's ok. Castle's gimmick with ""The Tingler"" is called ""Percepto"" and unfortunately, viewers of the film won't get the effect that moviegoers got unless they want to hook themselves up to a battery or two.  In theaters, ""Percepto"" was actually the act of hooking up movie seats with old motors that gave the viewer a small charge or vibration everytime someone screamed on the big screen.

The film does have a few actual thrills and chills throughout the movie.  In particular, the ""blood scene"" used to scare one of the actors to death giving Price his chance to discover The Tingler is particularly memorable because the blood is colorized for the scene in brilliant scarlet.

RECOMMENDED FOR VINCENT PRICE AND WILLIAM CASTLE FANS, IN PARTICULAR!",1170720000,12,1614,4.76978417266187
772084,3,6304017782,"William Castle was the king of gimmick horror, juicing up his sometimes-great-sometimes-really-hokey horror flicks with everything flying skeletons to two-tone glasses.

For ""The Tingler,"" it was a buzzer in the seat called Percepto, which would be a shock to anyone watching the movie. The movie itself was a rather uneven but original idea, with Vincent Price playing a borderline doctor who discovers the very roots of human fear. It's entertaining, but has some big flaws.

Dr. Warren Chapin (Price) is performing autopsies at a local prison, where each dead man died in the electric chair -- and something crushed their spines. To further his research, he frightens his nasty wife and X-rays her, and finds something that appears when afraid, and vanishes when the victim screams. He tries taking acid to frighten himself, but the experiment fails.

Then the deaf-mute wife of an acquaintance is frightened to death by some ghastly visions, and Chapin extracts an enormous, centipede-like worm from her spine -- the ""Tingler."" After Chapin's wife almost kills him with it, he decides that some borders should never be crossed. But before he can return the Tingler to its dead host, it escapes.

All B-movie goodness, complete with a rubber worm and deliciously vitriolic dialogue. While the idea of a spinal parasite fed by fear is a really hokey idea, Castle plays it so straight that the audience doesn't really have an opening for scoffing. Like a good fantasy story, it creates its own reality.

Castle was at his best when he was doing nasty dialogue, and he's in good form here (""There's a word for you."" ""There's several for you!""). He builds up a sense of rising tension throughout the straightforward plot, which is only broken when the movie ends. And despite tubs of blood and giant worms, Castle also shows his talent for the understatedly creepy when Chapin takes acid.

In fact, ""The Tingler"" would be a great B-movie if it weren't for two very hokey scenes. One is of a black screen, with Price's voice exhorting, ""The Tingler is in the theatre! Scream for your lives!"" Very awkward. The other is the final scene, which makes absolutely no sense, and has nothing to do with what comes before it. I guess Castle just needed a shock ending.

It must have been nice for Price to play a non-villain for once -- his Chapin is obsessed and a little twisted, but he isn't insane or nasty, and by the last act he's realized that science isn't the end-all. Patricia Cutts and Philip Coolidge give good performances too, as David's toxic wife and as a sweaty theatre manager who isn't as timid as he seems to be.

""The Tingler"" is a fairly entertaining cult horror movie, with good acting and a big rubber worm. If only it weren't for those two scenes.",1156032000,4,2762,4.8
772085,4,6304017782,"This is one of the best of the William Castle thrillers from the late 1950s through the early 1960s. Gimmick laden and full of fun, Castle films were always tongue in cheek and (nearly) always delivered.

""The Tingler"" has always been one of my very favorites in the Castle stable from the first time I saw it on TV as a kid. Of course, it loses a little of its gimmick impact when watching the film on television because the climax happens in a theater. The screen goes black and patrons are encouraged, by the star of the film, Vincent Price, to scream for their lives. However, in later years I have been fortunate enough to see the film in a big theater with chairs wired for ""shock"" value and the result, I can tell you, is electrifying. But seeing this at home, on DVD does not really dampen the fun in the slightest way.

The script, though far fetched, is really imaginative and Price gives his performance as much gusto as he would any of his more prestigious rolls. The supporting cast, including Darryl Hickman, (Dobie Gillis' brother) are equally as good. There are also some wonderful (and colorful) surprises (in a B & W film) that I won't give away. The best thing about this DVD, however, is the fact that the print used for the transfer is excellent, much better than the poor quality of ""The House On Haunted Hill"" or ""Day of the Triffids"" offered on Netflix.

772086,5,6304017782,"Perhaps the crown jewel in producer/director/huckster extraordinaire William Castle's catalog of films, The Tingler (1959) featured a couple of gimmicks, one of them he dubbed `Percepto'.  The gag was he had an army surplus motor rigged up to some seats within the theater that was showing The Tingler, with a control button in the projectionist's room and at a certain point in the feature, the projectionist would push a button sending a mild, electrical shock to some unwitting patrons to give the impression the creature in the movie was actually skulking around in the theater...it was an expensive gag, one many theater owners weren't willing to shell out the bucks for, so it didn't see widespread use...I doubt something like this could be done today in our overly litigious society, but I sure would have loved to have been there back in the day to witness the spectacle that must have ensued.  Produced and directed by Castle (House on Haunted Hill, Homicidal), and written by Robb White (House on Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts), the film stars Vincent Price (The Fly, Scream and Scream Again, The Abominable Dr. Phibes) in the second of two features he made with Castle (the first was House on Haunted Hill).  Also appearing is Darryl Hickman (Tea and Sympathy, The Iron Sheriff), Patricia Cutts (The Man Who Loved Redheads), Judith Evelyn (The Brothers Karamazov), Pamela Lincoln (Anatomy of a Psycho), and Philip Coolidge (The Mating Game, North by Northwest).

The movie opens with director Castle appearing on screen, issuing a warning to the audience that if they feel a tingly sensation, they should let out a scream as it just might save their lives.  Now we see a prisoner being taken down a hallway, headed for the electric chair to be juiced up...after a dimming of the lights, we then see Dr. Warren Chapin (Price) preparing to perform an autopsy on the deceased.  Prior to his starting, a man named Ollie Higgins (Coolidge) enters the room, stating he's the dead man's brother-in-law.  During the autopsy Warren notes the dead man's vertebrae is cracked, a mysterious but not uncommon phenomena within people who die in fear, as if some unseen force were at work (Ollie gives it the name of The Tingler).  Seems Warren, when not performing the occasional autopsy for the state, is engaging in experiments involving fear and postulates if enough fear tension is built up without being released (i.e. screaming), it might actually kill a person...Ollie wheedles a ride home from Warren, whom along with his creepy, bug-eyed, deaf-mute, germophobic wife Martha (Evelyn), run a movie theater specializing in old timey movies.  Eventually Warren heads home and we meet his sister-in-law Lucy (Lincoln), who's dating his assistant David (Hickman).  Turns out Warren's wife Isabel (Cutts), Lucy's older sister and guardian, doesn't approve of the relationship, specifically because she doesn't want Lucy to make the mistake she did involving herself with a scientist (she seems hardly one to be making judgments on others since she spends most of her time unfaithfully tramping around on her husband), and seeing as how she controls the purse strings, it creates a problem.  Warren continues his experiments, convinced there's a physical entity present when someone is in a state of fear, one that grows along with the level of terror, but the problem is once the person screams, the entity disappears...what he really needs is someone who can't release their fear tension, thereby allowing the entity to grow...hmmm, sounds like Martha might fit the bill...

One of the things I like about William Castle, who tended to emulate Alfred Hitchcock, and this is entirely my own perception, is that the man seemed to have no illusions about what he was doing, or the films he was making.  There aren't any attempts at grand, artistic statements here, only solid filmmaking with an eye towards entertaining audiences and making a few bucks in the process.  I'm not saying he couldn't have been more than what he was (with his last film, Shanks, released in 1974, he seemed to go beyond a bit), but he knew his talents and capabilities, used what he had, the result being some of the more memorable B films of the time...again, that's just my impression after seeing a number of his later features, so I could be way off base.  As far as The Tingler, apparently the idea for the story related in this movie came about after writer Robb White saw a worm-like prop intended to be used in the film House on Haunted Hill (1959).  Also, I believe the financial success Castle saw from House on Haunted Hill allowed him to have the better than average production values for this film.  The direction her is very strong, the performances solid, and the dialog sharp and sometimes witty.  The story is actually fairly complex, as are a few of the characters, some of whom are interested in Warren's research for their own gain.  I don't know what it is about Vincent Price and his characters, but it seems rare they ever have decent relationships with their wives, and here is no different...the benefit is it allows for some deliciously caustic exchanges including the following...

Isabel: There's a word for you.

Warren: There are several for you.

Along with this one...

Isabel: The only way Dave Morris will marry my sister is over my dead body.

Warren: Unconventional but not impossible.

As far as the creature itself it's black and looks like a cat-sized slug, sporting numerous legs and two, large antennae on one end.  It's kinda hokey, but it works for the movie.  While this is a black and white feature, there is an effective sequence that does use some color...I won't spoil it by going into detail, but it is one of the more interesting bits of the film.  One of my favorite sequences is when Price's character, in an effort to scare himself enough to experience the effects of his own Tingler (seems everyone has one), doses himself with a whopping amount of acid, making this one of the first features to depict the drug's usage.  As I said, the story is solid, but things do get a little weird by the end as Warren realizes his folly and tries to set things right.  The quest for scientific discovery is important, but sometimes the end results are not worth the price.

The picture quality on this DVD release, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital audio comes through excellent.  Extras include both English and Spanish audio tracks, a featurette titled `Scream for Your Lives', an original scream scene sequence with voice-over by Price, another scream scene sequence made for drive-ins with voice-over by Castle, subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai, liner notes on the insert, and a trailer for this film along for one for Night of the Living Dead (1990).

Just a note, the scream scene sequences included as part of the extras involved another gimmick, one where, at a certain point in the movie, the film would be interrupted and audiences would hear Price's voice stating The Tingler is loose in the theater, and the patrons had to scream as loud as they could to avoid being the creature's next victim (the idea was to have a plant in the audience, one who would scream, faint, and subsequently have to be carried out of the theater).

Having the creepie-crawlie trying to get its victim by the throat, only to drop off when the victim starts screaming, is clever. The use of LSD (not named but it's not hard to figure out) as a personal medical experiment is ahead of its time. Best of all, the deaf and dumb woman played by Judith Evelyn is genuinely eerie.

The movie is really hard to believe, but it's done with such panache and Vincent Price is at his excellent hammiest best, it rates as a real horror classic.  THE TINGLER is a physical embodiment of fear that looks like a centipede with claws and snaps the spinal cord of the victim IF they don't get to scream.  Price is joined by Judith Evelyn as a deaf mute whose nerdy husband (the excellent Phillip Coolidge) decides to use this tingler effect to scare her to death and run off with her fortune.  The movie has a classic sequence in which the tingler gets loose in a movie theater and he tells everyone to scream for their lives!

Castle was known for his gimmicky showmanship, evidenced in such films as 13 GHOSTS (with its 3-D glasses) and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL  (with a skeleton flying through the theater audience), and in THE TINGLER he gave us horror fans exactly what we wanted--a good scream!!!",1130803200,5,1169,4.729064039408867
772090,5,6304017782,"""The Tingler"" (1959 - 82 minutes - B&W), is a classic of horror and
science fiction produced and directed by the remarkable master William
Castle, who was known for setting tricks in the cinema rooms in fifties
and sixties in order to interact the audience with the film. (In ""The
Tigler"", Castle placed an equipment, the ""Percepto"", inside the cinema
armchairs so that, when the audience shouts during the movie, they felt
a shock).
In this masterpiece, Vincent Price is Dr. Warren Chapin, an obstinate
doctor of legal medicine who discovers that fear causes the ""tingler
effect"" with the growth of a parasitic creature near the vertebral
column. Chapin could isolate and remove the creature of a deaf and dumb
woman (the actress Judith Evelyn) but the ""thing"" escapes and runs away
to a full cinema. A way to defeat the creature is to shout loud.
According to John Waters, of the ""Film Comment"", the film shows the
first citation of LSD of the cinema. The writer Robb White had heard
about the lisergic acid from Aldous Huxley, he went to the UCLA to try
the drug in himself (before it became illegal) and then he introduced

772205,5,6304017782,"I admit it! I am a sucker for old Black and White horror films.  They are quite tame by today's buckets of bloody special effect big budgets ones, but they hold a fun all their own.  Especially when the ringmaster is the oh so talented Vincent Price.  He was always the odd mix of silky mannered menace, with that sprinkle of humour that set him apart from so many actors.  It was that devilish twinkle in his eye that always told you he enjoyed what he was doing.
The Tingler is another of the Castle low budget treats.  Price plays a mild mannered doctor/research scientist married to a rich wife who is a floozy.  She runs around on Price, cares little that he knows it, controls her younger sister's life, but Price is not a man you push too far. Obsessed with discovered the results fear has on the body, he finds out there is a critter that increases in our bodies when we are frightened, the more fear the bigger and stronger it grows and the only thing that can destroy it is screaming.  Feed up with his wife's wicked ways, he convinces her he is going to kill her so he can X-ray her trying to prove the existence of the Tingler.
Price gets mixed up with Olly, a husband of a theatre owner who is a deaf-mute.  She goes bonkers and passes out when she sees blood.  Price wonders what would happen in her, if the Tingler is unleashed, but she cannot scream.  Later, someone deliberately scares her to death, and Price operates and removed the Tingler.  But then, wife tries to use the Tingler to strangle Price...all in good loving fun, mind you.  The pesky beastie dashes off and heads to the theatre to menace everyone there.
One note, though the film was shot in Black and White, the sequence where Olly's wife is driven to death was shot in colour emphasize the red of the blood scaring her.
Great fun and it's a bit of a walk down memory lane!  A must for any fan of Castle or Price.",1067385600,37,1897,4.324858757062147
772206,5,6304017782,"Two horror masters are at work here. William Castle presenting one of his most outlandish and original films and Vincent Price at his least hammy best as a doctor who discovers ""the fear factor"". The ""factor"" being a slimy looking centipede-like creature that grows on peoples' spines when they become frightened. If the person doesn't scream (destroying the creature) they will die. The doctor even experiments with LSD in a bizarre sequence to induce fear in himself. The most memorable sequence is still the color one. In a subplot, a theater manager with a mute wife who suffers from OCD plans to kill her for her money by scaring her to death. The wife (a great Judith Evelyn) is alone in the apartment and is assaulted with ghoulish horrors like an axe being hurled at her, her death certificate on the bathroom medicine cabinet, the bathtub filled with blood with a bloody hand and arm reaching out of it for her, the taps running blood, etc. This is done in color for maximum effect and the poor wife dies from fright because she cannot scream---being mute. This is where Price discovers ""the tingler"". Impulsively, he does an illegal autopsy on the woman and finds the creature attached to her spine and removes it. It later escapes into the theater filled with people and Price gets on the horn and exhorts them to ""Scream! Scream for your lives! The tingler is loose in this very theater!"" Of course this is where Castles' gimmick of ""Percepto"" came in. The seats in theaters showing ""The Tingler"" were wired to produce mild shocks to patrons at key horror moments. How can you top that? ""The Tingler"" is great fun from start to finish. Pure entertainment and Castle at his morbidly lurid best.",1037318400,5,1705,4.724832214765101
772207,3,6304017782,"THE TINGLER begins with an amusing intro by director William Castle with Castle imploring viewers to scream to control the Tingler. A brilliant concept and gimmick which suprisingly became a pretty good movie.
Price plays coroner William Chapin who discovers that fear causes a parasite to grow on people's spines, which he calls ""The Tingler"". The creature, which resembles a giant lobster, can only be destroyed by its host's screams, so Price decides  a deaf-mute woman who works at his local movie theater is the ideal subject to use for his experiments.
This is the infamous movie in which some seats in theatres were rigged with joy buzzers (Percepto) to give viewers mild electric shocks when the ""Tingler"" was loose in the theater. One memorable sequence is partially in color. A must see for cult movie buffs and fans of Vincent Price who is his usual wonderful hammy self.",1037145600,5,882,4.919463087248322
772208,5,6304017782,"I honestly don't know if this movie was supposed to be horror, or comedy. I'd say a little bit of both? I really liked this movie. Vincent Price is again excellent! Throughout most of the movie he is trying to discover what makes people fearful & what causes them to scream. Well, he soons finds out as he removes The Tingler from a corpse. Also, there is an interesting plot twist. Ooh, also watch as Vincent has a bad trip on some ""acid""! Oh, and yes, at one point of the movie you can see the string to The Tingler. Either way, it's still a fun movie to watch. I wish I could've seen it in theaters!",1032739200,3,602,4.153846153846154
772209,4,6304017782,"William Castle was reknowned for his gimmicky films. For THE TINGLER he had ""Percepto,"" and it was a lulu: randomly selected seats in the theatre were wired with a small motor, and at a peak moment in the film these motors came to life and literally gave your bottom a buzz!  But unless you happen to have a really warped sense of humor plus some mechanical apptitude, you'll have to forego the ""Percepto"" effect and settle for one of the most weirdo stories to come down the street.

A doctor (Vincent Price) is studying the effects of fear.  In the process, he finds that fear causes a nasty, worm-like creature to grow inside the human body along the spine.  Release your fear by screaming, and the creature is destroyed; if for some reason you cannot scream, however, the creature merely grows larger and larger and kills you by crushing your spine.  What the good doctor really wants, of course, is to lay his hands on one of these critters--and when a man murders his deaf-mute wife by scaring her to death, Dr. Vince gets his chance.  Eventually ""The Tingler"" escapes into a movie theatre, and the seat-buzzing begins!

Price and company give it their all, and the film is as enjoyable as only schlock horror can be.  Fans of the genre will hoot over the murder, Vincent Price's LSD trip, the scenes where the tingler escapes into the theatre--not to mention at the monster itself, which looks like a cross between an overweight centipede and a lobster.  And yes, you really can see the wires!  The DVD edition also includes lots of fun extras, including a short documentary on the film.  Castle fans will get a kick out of it, but all others are warned away!

A neat little idea to keep folks awake..and for the rest of us to ponder. The introduction is priceless and Mr. C sure is a showman. Sit back and relax....and scream if you have to..if not bring the "" Tingler"" to your local chiropracter for an adjustment.

7860476,4,6304017782,"Vincent Price at his best, even in a potentially second-best environment. Now that I think of it, THE TINGLER can very well be an allegorical or satirical way to say, ""Don't try to hide the fear and uncertainty inside! Or it will just rip and its way out!"" As with Cronenberg films after it, you initially feel the protagonist is nuts or a menace to be punished but then the more you see the frontrunner's strife the more you don't like. Furthermore, this one shows how screams are the finest feature in horror films aside from the human or non-human creepers themselves.",1514246400,,571,4.607843137254902
