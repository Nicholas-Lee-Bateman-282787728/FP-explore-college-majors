2726047,1,B000M7FOO8,"The long-running Culture War in America between Marxists vs. Traditionalists continues. The well-entrenched Lefts latest propaganda attack aimed at the demoralization of Traditionalists and their children is to remake classic and wholesome family-themed films and TV shows and inject them with their degenerate ""Hollywood values"". The Dukes are remade into morons and whores and with a general theme of hedonism. Gone are their high values based in Christianity: personal honor, sacrifice, virtue and honesty. The film feels bigoted toward European-Americans, with the clear aim to both defame and demoralize them. Americas enemies own the mass media, but people are waking up to the ugly truth that traitors is who and what they are. Literally pedophiles with an obvious agenda to change our nations organic culture and replace it with their plastic media-culture and celebrity-worship.

2726063,5,B000M7FOO8,"This movie is about the Dukes before they ever got on Boss Hogg's bad side. However, you guessed it, it also shows how they get on Boss Hogg's bad side. Boss Hogg catches Luke Duke with LuLu and all sorts of trouble starts to happen! Hogg tries to take away the Duke farm and run them out of the moonshining business. The young Dukes are still teenagers when all of this occurs. Daisy Duke starts out as a rather dawdy church girl that gets turned down for a job at the Boar's Nest but drops mouths when she re-applies in her ""Daisy Dukes"" which is where that rap statement originated. Speaking of, Cowboy Troy has a music video included in this and he is well known for combining country music with rap/hip-hop(yes, you read that right!). Daisy is SULTRY in this movie and they do not spare the nudity or cussing in this version. This version is NOT for anybody under 18.

The film gives us glimpses of Bo (Jonathan Bennett) and Luke (Randy Wayne) before they go live with their uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). It also shows us the finding of the General Lee in a lake, the initial rift with Boss Hogg, and the transformation of Daisy Duke.

The accents were for the most part terrible. The unrated version featured numerous topless blonds that made the transformation of Daisy Duke into a vixen, anti-climatic. Harland Williams as Roscoe was over the top. The film was very corny and not well done.

2726075,1,B000M7FOO8,"My children have fallen in love the old TV hit, Dukes of Hazzard. They are 5 & 2, so the original show is pretty ideal for them. They enjoy the General Lee and the ""duke boys"" getting in trouble and then fixing the problem.  Not to mention if I never watch Spongebob again, it'll be too soon.

After an episode one evening this movie (The beginning) came on. We sat to watch it together. Umm big mistake! It is extremely sexual and the Duke boys have very potty mouths. I'm not one of those parents that screen everything so my kids won't be exposed to the real world until they move out. However, I do want them to be non-perverted children. I was just amazed that someone could take a hit show and make it quite awful but I guess that is TV for you.

Back to the review; the actors were pretty bad, I didn't think the actors that played Bo & Luke fit the part. Daisy's character was alright. None had acting skills. They can be easily compared to the acting skills of Bella & Edward (from Twilight... Yuck)  Anywhoo, I definitely would not recommend this movie. Unless you are really stoned and it came on tv for free.",1299369600,,1120,4.293838862559242

2726078,2,B000M7FOO8,"""The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning"" is yet another unimaginative rehash of a television series that's better off left alone. This film is a prequel which explains how the Duke clan got their start as fast-driving moonshiners. The casting is interesting, with Willie Nelson cast as a stoned Uncle Jesse, the family patriarch and moonshiner-in-chief. In all seriousness Willie should stick to singing. Perhaps his infamous IRS bill makes him take work he otherwise would refuse. I hope that's the reason he's here, anyway.

Bo and Luke Duke (Jonathan Bennett and Randy Wayne) are largely satisfactory here, if a bit denser and more slapstick than necessary (the scenes in drag are rather painful), while Harland Williams as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was a rather bizarre choice: he's a naturally funny guy, but his ad libs border on the otherworldly (""Did that manatee just swallow that cabbage whole?"" was one that made it into the extras, for instance). Christopher McDonald does a decent job as Boss Hogg, while rest of the cast is mediocre at best.

The plot runs along as you would expect it would, with lots of uninspiring car chases in the General Lee, lots of bad double entendre, and subplots about an illegal ice cream facility and a pig (""Dainty"") on a corrugated metal roof (which alternated between a live pig, a rubber pig, and a very hokey animatronic stunt pig, which talks in the extras). The extras are more interesting than the film, and include the birth of the General Lee, the tales of Dainty the pig, the story of Daisy Duke (which is way less interesting that you would expect), and a music video which features a country-rap hybrid about the Duke boys. Really.

Generally I don't like TV shows recycled into films, and this is no exception. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's plenty boring, and certainly not worth an hour and a half of your time.",1275264000,5,1887,4.782208588957055

2726080,1,B000M7FOO8,"This will be short because I do not want to waste anymore of my time thinking about this film.

What were they THINKING when they made this?

2726085,2,B000M7FOO8,"Ugh.  The 2005 movie wasn't great and this prequel is far weaker than that movie in every way possible.  Most of the characterization is unbelievable.  Many of the script elements are unbelievable (a pig on a roof?)  One would expect to be able to count on the Dukes to, at the very least, deliver interesting car stunts.  Alas, no, not here.  I wasn't expecting anything very good from this, but I wasn't expecting to be so bored either.",1185926400,2,438,4.551282051282051
2726086,2,B000M7FOO8,"Surely, there must be a way for all of us fans of the real Dukes of Hazzard to get together and stop Hollywood from making these stupid movies that spit upon the traditions of the television series.  Maybe you're wondering why I would even bother to watch this straight-to-DVD ""prequel.""  Well, I'll tell you - I just had to see if it could possibly be even worse than the first movie (and, uh, April Scott was looking mighty fine on the DVD cover).  Much to my surprise, I think this film might actually be a smidgen better than the first one.  That's not to say that this one doesn't stink like all the manure on Uncle Jessie's farm, though, because it does.  It did make me laugh a time or two, though, so I think I'm being rather generous in giving the film two stars.

Apart from Willie Nelson, this film sports an all-new cast, with Jonathan Bennett and Randy Wayne taking on the roles of Bo and Luke, respectively.  Both cousins, who haven't seen each other in several years, are sent to work on Uncle Jessie's farm in order to keep them out of trouble (Luke's a pyromaniac and Bo's an all-around menace to society).  Daisy (April Scott) is also there, but she surely isn't the Daisy I was expecting.  This Daisy is a good girl who dresses in frumpy clothes, does basically nothing with her hair, and can't get any man to notice her (except for hall monitor Enos).  The movie's halfway over before she transforms herself and breaks out the Daisy Dukes I know I was looking for.  Even then, she's no Catherine Bach, but she's certainly prettier - and a much better actress - than Jessica Simpson.  Christopher McDonald plays this younger version of Boss Hogg.  He's certainly a step up from Burt Reynolds, but why in the world they go out and get a tall, lanky guy to fill the definitive shoes of the short and stocky Sorrell Booke is still a mystery to me.  James Best will always be the one and only Rosco, but I guess Harland Williams does OK in the role, especially for a comedian turned actor.  Finally, the filmmakers apparently didn't appreciate Ben Jones, the real Cooter, telling fans not to watch the first movie because they turn Cooter into a complete idiot in this movie.

Basically, this film supposedly shows us the origin of the Duke Boys.  Uncle Jessie and Boss Hogg are actually buddies at the start, but these fellow moonshiners part ways when Boss Hogg demands a bigger cut of Uncle Jessie's business.  The Duke farm is soon on the line as Boss Hogg declares Hazzard a dry county and sics Roscoe on all of the moonshiners in the area (especially the Dukes).  Bo and Luke volunteer to distribute the moonshine - but first, they need a fast car (enter the General Lee).  Daisy wants to help out by getting a job at the Boar's Nest, but first she has to stop dressing like a schoolmarm and come up with a new, sexy look.  From that point on, it's just a matter of getting through a bunch of stupid plot points and shenanigans on the way to the most predictable of endings.

Let me also say a few words about the women in this movie.  Hazzard County is supposedly in North Carolina, the state I've lived in all of my life, and I just have to say that (apart from April Scott) the women in this film, especially the peroxide blondes Bo and Luke keep chasing, can't hold a candle to the true Southern girls of North Carolina.  Carolina girls are the best in the world, but you wouldn't know it from watching this film.

I for one hope the Dukes of Hazzard movies will stop at two.  Neither of them have been loyal to the spirit of the show, especially when it comes to Uncle Jessie, and there are plenty of other dumb scripts floating around out there in La-La Land full of the same dumb jokes and toilet humor you'll find here.",1184630400,7,3748,4.419213973799127
2726087,5,B000M7FOO8,"This direct-to-video film presents a second reincarnation of Bo and Luke Duke. Two little-known actors respectively portray Bo and Luke Duke on probation for smuggling moonshine. These guys don't carry ""star power"" like Tom Wopat and John Schneider did on the 1979-85 CBS comedy-adventure. April Bloom is Bo's and Luke's beautiful cousin,Daisy who works as a barmaid at the Boar's Nest,owned by Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg(Christopher MacDonald). Country legend Willie Nelson reprises his role of Uncle Jesse Duke that he first played in the 2005 theatrical film who runs the Dukes' farm. I believe that Nelson was chosen to reprise his character because of his facial characteristics(white hair and white beard). Nelson's late longtime buddy Waylon Jennings wrote and performed the theme GOOD OL' BOYS on the series. I dedicate this item to the memories of Jennings,Sorrell Booke who played Boss on the series,Denver Pyle who played Uncle Jesse on the series and to the survivors of the series cast.",1181606400,2,1028,5.3128834355828225

2726090,3,B000M7FOO8,"I enjoyed this movie. There were a couple of things that I didn't like about it,but there were a lot more things about it that I did like. I didn't like Willie Nelson playing Jessie Duke(again).He played Jessie as a drugged out dirty joke telling drunk,and Uncle Jessie was none of the above(we did see him drinking moonshine and losing his temper on the original show from time to time,but he was always a gentleman to the core.).I thought that Roscoe Coltrane was nowhere as enjoyable as in the t.v. series. In the series,Roscoe may have been a bumbling,ineffective sherrif,but he was never a paranoid schitzophrenic like in this version. I did like Chris MacDonald as Boss Hog and I especially enjoyed April Scott as Daisy Duke. She is definately much prettier and sexier than Jessica Simpson. A real class act by comparrison,although Cathy Bach will always be my favorite as Daisy,I hope that April will come back and play Daisy in any future sequels. This movie is far better than the 2005 version which was a real stinker no matter how you look at it-a real piece of crap. Of course,the real star of the show,what makes any Dukes of Hazzard show watchable,is that 4000 pound hunk of steel and plastic known as a 1969 Dodge Charger-better known as the General Lee. I understand that when the original Dukes of Hazzard t.v. show was on,the car actually received more fan mail than the actors!!The General Lee Lives!",1178841600,,1419,4.725806451612903

It is fun seeing Daisy's transformation, this Boss Hogg is better than Burt Reynolds, and it does flow into the TV series fairly well.  HOWEVER...Uncle Jesse (sorry Willie) doesn't need to stoop to the boys' level humor-wise.  He was supposed to be the patriarch, not be right in there with sex jokes, etc.  There is no substitute for Ben Jones as Cooter, and Lara Flynn Boyle's entire character was plain offensive ...

This isn't your mamma and daddy's Dukes of Hazzard, taking the cursing and bare breasts into consideration, not that I'm condemning bare breasts, or anything like that.

Unlike the Dukes' 2005 movie release, this prequel ventures closer to the original with the slapstick goofiness of the characters, yet don't expect the same old same old. All of the main characters have been reworked, rewritten, and revamped, so get over that part before watching this. And I must say, April Scott is a red-hot Daisy Duke. Holy Shhhhhhh...Moly. Either I'm developing bronchitis, or she makes me breath funny. I'll have to get that checked out.

This movie is what it is, so don't venture into the experience expecting academy award material, but that's the beauty of it. Quit being so uptight and enjoy a touch of goofiness.

2726096,2,B000M7FOO8,"This movie really did not hold true to the story of the dukes of hazzard. It was just these two kids running around and doing things that are done in most college comedies, like driving through a locker room. It's just not the dukes.  The Roscoe character is not the stubborn officer of the law that we know, and the whole Boss Hog thing, well, just not like the one in the series.  I can not believe Willie Nelson re-signed for his role as Uncle Jesse again.  I hope they do not try to continue this series.  Rent it if you must, you may laugh a few times, but then return with care.",1174089600,2,584,4.1415929203539825
2726097,3,B000M7FOO8,"I watched the DVD of this last night, and I've been mulling over my feelings about it today, on and off.  I feel a bit split down the middle about it. Ok, my initial reactions when viewing this was that it was a travesty, in Hazzard terms. The main thing that's wrong with it is the change in tone of the attitudes and depiction of *some* of the characters. Bo and Luke were always clean cut well meaning boys. They may not have been mensa candidates, but they had their smarts. The problem with this film and the previous film is that they are depicted almost like morons. I thought the casting of the two leads was ok though, better than the previous movie. The next problem is Uncle Jesse. Willie Nelson looks the part and is an OK substitute for Denver Pyle, but that's it. The fact that he isn't an actor really shows and he's patently unable to embelish the character with any of the warmth that Denver brought. Uncle Jesse never told any crude jokes in the original series either. It really lowers the tone, if you have to have crude jokes and swearing at least limit it to just Bo and Luke, leave Uncle Jesse out of it. Uncle Jesse was the heart and soul of the Dukes Of Hazzard, he was the Obi-Wan of the series. Right on to the other cast members, I thought they were OK, you're never going to find replacements for Sorrell Booke and James Best, but I thought Christopher Macdonald did quite a good job of Boss, better than Burt Reynolds anyhow. The actor that played Rosco was an interesting choice, OK I suppose, but no James Best. The girl that played Daisy, she was a bit on the thin side, but I still would.

Apart from the crudeness and some of the jokes I thought the story line was OK. It still felt like the Dukes of Hazzard in this sense. SO despite these misgivings, I wouldn't mind seeing another film with this cast.

I'm not a prude by any stretch, and  I like films like Animal House and Porkys or American Pie. It's just watching that kind of humor transplanted into a beloved family franchise like this is a bitter pill to swallow.

3 stars for being an improvement on the last film, but must try harder for the next.",1174003200,40,2144,4.323383084577115
2726098,2,B000M7FOO8,"The 2005 movie was not good at all. I felt it was incosistent with the original Dukes who were more like Robin hood than just rowdy moonshiners, and this movie doen't do much to that. The acting is horrible, and I can't believe Willie Nelson signed on for this one.  I thought at times this might have a glimmer of the original series, such as the boys actually messing around with Rosco than Rosco being a Hard edged sherrif, but then it would loose it again in bad script and acting.  Rent if you must, but just not a great movie.",1173830400,2,532,4.257425742574258
2726099,4,B000M7FOO8,"After debating over and over and over again on whether to pick up the first Dukes of Hazzard movie I elected to pass on it. I just couldn't see Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson and Sean William Scott, sporting mustaches and beards? I won't even degrade the memory of the original television series by sitting down and watching this piece of crap.

BUT, after buying and watching the Unrated of Dukes of Hazzard - The Beginning, I must say, that Warner Brothers realized their mistake and recast the lead roles of Bo and Luke Duke as well as Daisy. While it misses the original feelings and emotions of the television series it does gives fans who were disappointed by the 2005 movie. If you're able to grab this for around $10-15, I would recommend picking this one up.

Also, while it does explain how the Dukes came to be, it doesn't explain about the Boys' probation or how they got caught. Hopefully, there'll be another film that wraps up this dangling subplot.",1173830400,,967,4.649122807017544

Thanks to todays society and brainless filmmakers they have turned a darn good action packed family T.V. series into an adult oriented movie.  Don't get me wrong, I love seeing all of the nudity, sex, profanity, and violence on the big screen but not if they ruin a classic series to do it.  I grew up with the original Dukes of Hazzard and it gave me great joy to buy all seven seasons on DVD so that I could show my 6yr. old and 3yr. old what quality television really was.  I never thought that I would be telling my kids to close their eyes during scenes from a Dukes of Hazzard movie.  Rent this movie first.  It does have a few funny scenes, but not $20 worth.  The poor General Lee is only allowed to do one jump and it is so poorly done that it looks like a hotwheel car flying through the air.

2726106,3,B000M7FOO8,"I agree that this movie should not have been on the Family Channel. The subject matter was way too adult to be a family flick. I also think everyone expected it to be comparable to the TV show or the movie, but based on the previews I saw, I knew it was just going to be another mindless skin flick. But I like mindless skin flicks! I don't expect the acting to be good, just the visuals!  I put it right up there with American Pie Band Camp and Naked Mile. I don't expect anything from movies like that other than great boobs and abs and this movie delivers all of that. So I liked it. I figured some of the scenes had to be cut out due to it being on ABC Family on a Sunday night. So I can't wait to see the uncut version!

2726107,1,B000M7FOO8,"This movie achieved new lows in every way and should not be associated with The Dukes of Hazzard. The acting, writing and plot sucked. While the car looked correct, it sounded like it had a worn out 318 with bad lifters. Even the slide across the hood was contrived and, worse yet, reversed with Bo doing the slide. He couldn't even get in and out the car well. The best thing about this movie is that it was on TV before going on sale so I know to never buy this trash and to tell everyone to avoid it. Don't buy it, don't watch it and don't look back. This should never have been filmed and the cast, crew, writers and actors should quit their jobs permanently. Appallingly bad. Ben Jones (the original Cooter) said in an interview that no one should watch the 2005 film with Johnny Knoxville and Jessica Simpson. With talent (a term I use very loosely) that bad, how good could it have ever hoped to be? The Dukes of Hazzard - The Beginning makes that one look like it belongs with Casablanca as one of the all-time greats. The Dukes of Hazzard -  The Beginning is beyond bad.

2726108,1,B000M7FOO8,"This movie only gets 1 star, for getting the make/model/color of the General Lee right. Everything else was horrible. I got to see the whole movie on the ABC Family channel, where it definitely did NOT belong. This movie had lots of adult themes and situations and was not appropriate for children under 13. I feel bad for the grown-ups who loved and cherished the Dukes series when they were little and were excited to show their children this movie (which aired on prime time Sunday night) only to have to change the channel 15 minutes into the movie because of the language or the content.

For those who haven't seen ""The Dukes... Beginning"", don't waste your time. It's just a slightly watered down version of the 2005 movie. They've dumbed down the cousins even more, and slutted up Daisy real nice. If you liked all the T & A from the 2005 movie, this'll be right up your alley. I'm sure for this ""Unrated"" version, it'll probably be much worse. For those of us who remember what southern gentlemen the Dukes were and how much of a lady Daisy was, this is an insult to our childhood memories.",1173052800,17,1099,4.522613065326633

One good sign was not bringing back Burt Reynolds.

Boss was a rat at heart, but would never have laid a finger on Jessie.

Jessica Simpson made her trashy.
