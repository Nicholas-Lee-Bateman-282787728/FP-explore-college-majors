1. Rescue at Rocky Ridge
2. Wilson's Forest Flare
3. Skylar's Squad
4. Brewster's Crane Training
5. Wobbly Wheels
6. Wilson's Paper Trail",1383782400,26,347,4.783333333333333
5683161,5,B00BZMMR6W,"It is great to see a new Chuggington DVD.  My son loves the show and we enjoyed the episodes.  They chuggers are ""growing up"" and it is exciting to see Chuggington show that is a part of life too.  Entertains my little man- and it a positive show vs some of the Nickelodeon shows that are out there.",1381276800,,299,4.120689655172414
5683162,3,B00BZMMR6W,"First off I like Chugginton and I think it's a nice kids show, but the DVD is just two separate episodes merged together to form this 'special' and compare it to the ones from Thomas & Friends, the Thomas ones kept it into one entity and makes it feel like a DVD special. But it has a great story some excellent morals in a visual standpoint as well so it's not bad.",1378080000,,366,4.097222222222222
