6248126,1,B00I30MQA6,"Warning - 4 star trailer, 1 star movie. Had a couple cute girls and couldn't even show us some skin. 3/4 of the way through the movie, the old man kills himself with a scalpel. This left my son and I jealous that he did not finish us first. I've seen scarier home movies that featured kittens and babies. The scariest part is that someone actually financed this movie. Wait, I just realized I'm a complete idiot for renting it, which actually makes them geniuses.",1403481600,2,463,4.458823529411765

6248129,1,B00I30MQA6,"This movie is awful. I understand they made this on a shoe string budget, but it's really bad writing, too. Writing and effort don't require a budget. The story is so vague and then the movie just ends. What happened to some of the characters. Blonde woman runs off in the storage building, we never see her again. They don't imply anything happened to her, she just disappears. Skip this",1400457600,,388,4.557142857142857
6248130,1,B00I30MQA6,Great preview. Very misleading and disappointing. It's one of those you just keep waiting thinking it has to get better. It doesn't,1400371200,,131,5.0
6248131,3,B00I30MQA6,"In the city of angels, Gabriel (Gabriel De Santi) is mailed a key to a storage shed. Gabriel is interested in the shed as it holds a key to his real parentage. There are homeless people who live in some of the sheds and a mean owner named Arsen (Yasha Blackman), a second generation American who opted to keep his accent. Samira (Bree Essrig) is a chunky redhead who works there and takes an immediate liking to Gabriel who doesn't get along with the owner, hates life, and ignores his acting coach.

There is also a naked woman (Cherie Daly) whose name is Jezebel that walks around like Mathilda May in ""Lifeforce."" Frequent ""B"" actress Bai Ling has a small role looking like the ho girlfriend of an NBA owner. Jillisa Lynn shows off her hammy legs, apparently on the same non-diet plan as Bree Essrig.

The plot is straight forward and is explained about a third of the way through.

The film could have been better. They went out of their way to create odd homeless characters and then did nothing entertaining with them. They needed to up the gore factor as the horror factor couldn't carry the film.

In spite of any claim, this is not based on a true story, other than the fact people live in storage units.

Okay as a desperation horror rental. Thank you writer/director Patrick Hasson for NOT making this a hand held camera film.

6248133,5,B00I30MQA6,"Blood shed was way better than i expected it to be. The story revolving around homeless people living in storage units with a woman/demon and the woman's backstory were both good. Don't listen to the other review, Blood shed is great low budget movie that deserves a look. 9/10 Thanx for reading.",1398902400,2,296,4.711538461538462
6248134,2,B00I30MQA6,A messy blood shed it is. The box art is cool however stay away. Black woman smoking a cigar. A russian tennant owner....a seizure man who has old clippings....a blue hair wig woman and etc add to the messy film. Bad acting with the only charm is a fire red head who clearly is happy to get a paycheck. I don't know if this hit theaters but it has terrorized Red Box rental machines. I have seen better movies like Paranormal Activity but this one....throw in the trash.. Dont flush it down the toilet....Might overflow.,1398124800,4,520,4.484210526315789
8638555,3,B00I30MQA6,"Blood Shed is actually okay.  Well, you have to overlook the fact that it takes an eternity for any killings to actually happen.  For over an hour there's exactly 2 killings, and that's it, and we don't even see the graphic part!  Plus a pretty good twist happens at the end.

The story's about a demonic woman who's haunting a storage facility in Los Angeles.  It's a bit strange I think that we see a message in the beginning that mentions over 100,000 homeless people live in LA.  While the story is about homeless people hiding and sleeping in this one particular storage facility, a horror movie like this feels like a weird choice to include such a realistic detail.

Anyway the characters are decent.  The story definitely devotes a lot of time to each one which is something I like.  Everyone who knows me knows I absolutely *hate* when a movie just throws characters on the screen for no reason, and we never even get a chance to care about them.  This movie has quite the cast.  Le'ts go through them.  We have the storage facility owner who's a bit of a jerk but he needs to be in order to keep homeless people away from his building.  Despite this viewers can't help but feel sorry for the Spanish guy who's the main character.  He's homeless and living in his car, but despite that he desperately tries to spend the night in the storage facility every night.

We have the red haired spunky girl who works with the storage facility owner.  She seems happy all the time even though she later admits she hides her true feelings.  She later invites her blonde haired friend over.  She's pretty unpleasant and thinks it's gross her red haired friend has a crush on the Spanish guy since he's homeless, but this is because the girl can sense he's not that bad of a guy.  He never opens up and explains why he's homeless however.  Elsewhere we have a man with blue hair and dresses like a woman and his Asian drug-loving girlfriend who has to pee really bad in one scene and doesn't have a very nice attitude either.  We have a mother and son who are also homeless.

Oh and a mysterious old man who likes to play around on his typewriter in the middle of the hallway.  The final character is a pregnant woman whose husband was killed by the demon woman hiding in the lower portion of the facility.  For the longest time every time we see the pregnant woman, the demon is rubbing her belly before inevitably killing her.

Oh and about that typewriter guy.  When the demon woman finally leaves her storage area and joins the rest of the homeless folks, she grabs the typewriter guy's head.  It appears he's having a deep thought, and it's the following- we see a Spanish woman going to an African voodoo lady because she wants her husband to love her forever.  The voodoo lady applies her magic to the lady and makes sure her husband will love her and her baby forever.  We now see this pregnant woman taking a bath while her husband is near the sink.  He treats his wife like total crap.  He beats on her and threatens that if she ever leaves he'll kill her.  He's actually much sicker than this.  While the woman is playing with her baby in the bathtub (or giving birth- can't tell) he takes a blow dryer and throws it in the bathtub electrocuting both her and the baby.  This same woman is back from the dead and roaming around the storage facility looking for revenge.

For the longest time these characters roam around the storage facility not doing much of anything.  The Spanish guy becomes friends with that one kid who's with his mother.  The Spanish guy likes to try and one-up the owner of the building by hiding in storage units that he know the owner won't check, but he gets caught more than he's able to hide.  Luckily the red haired girl is always there to free the Spanish guy since she likes him.

The killings are pretty lame.  In fact we don't see the killings that happen in the first hour. SPOILERS.  The demon woman kills the blue haired woman/man by stabbing his temple with her pointy fingers, and she kills his Asian girlfriend too.  She also kills that boy's mother which leads to a moment that should have been shocking and sad, but it doesn't come across that way.  Love the twist at the end.  The demon woman is actually the Spanish guy's mother.  So apparently that bathtub scene happened a long time ago when he was just a baby.  How did he survive the electrocution?  I have no idea.

Also, why did the Spanish guy not mind when the red headed girl attacked his mother and threw her into a back room to electrocute her?  He didn't mind this at all, and in the next scene (the ending) we see the Spanish guy and the red haired girl kissing.  What?  Perhaps he realized his mom was demonic, but still, it's his mother and at least for this scene she appeared normal.  There wasn't any build-up to this final moment.  Otherwise the typewriter guy not able to speak and dropping clues on his typewriter about the demon is perhaps another interesting element to the story but it's nothing special.

This movie is average at best with characters that hardly ever rise above mediocrity in their roles and never say or do anything interesting, but somehow this movie kept my interest thanks to the characters given time to establish themselves.  All this despite no backstory telling us why they're homeless or anything, but then again perhaps that's realistic of being homeless- they're usually pretty quiet.  Seriously the movie doesn't try to give us any backstory except for a couple key moments in the story and that's it.  I'll give it 3 stars.  The movie does have a little bit of an eerie setting which is nice.  Oh and don't expect much blood.  There really isn't any.  False title!  Unless.. wait a minute.  Blood ""shed"" since the characters are in storage sheds?  Doesn't quite satisfy me for an answer but it's close enough, lol.",1500508800,,5870,4.49905303030303

8638557,1,B00I30MQA6,"This movie was not even worth my 1 star rating...As a hardcore horror fan, I was really disappointed in being misled into watching this!!!

The plot was abhorrent, the composition was heinous -- and as for the acting -- I am certain that these actors were on a really low budget because no one gets paid $$$ to act that way.

8638564,1,B00I30MQA6,"I could attack this movie at several levels suffice it to say, ""It was AWFUL!"".  I bought the movie because Bai Ling was in it.  I never thought I could buy a film with her in it and regret doing so.  Her role was brief and the character was meaningless.  The film is disjointed and the editing was very amateur.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end.  If you're like me, a BIG Bai Ling fan, her last movie of value that showcased her talent was 'A Beautiful Life' from 2008.  Since then she has landed bazaar roles in 'B' movies (and this movie rates below that) which is a shame.  Given the chance, she has Oscar winning talent as an actress but I doubt she'll ever have the opportunity to achieve that award.  Her lifestyle has done a lot of damage to her professional career and that's a real shame!",1406073600,2,801,4.251655629139073
