5368848,5,B009UHGSRI,It clearly explained why Admiral Yamamoto was against Japan going to war because Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto new its weaknesses and strength like nobody else and realized that the attack on Pearl Harbor was a disaster because of The Hideki Togo regime!!

5368849,4,B009UHGSRI,"Very good biographical movie on Yamamoto, and the period just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Greatly acted although the CGI of the air battles makes them seem slightly cartoonish.
Those who have studied the Pacific War will also notice the glaring errors at Midway. First the Japanese carriers dod not have a full deck of aircraft when they were hit by the dive bombers and second, there is no record of a Kamikaze attack on Saratoga.
That aside, this was a great movie to watch.",1401408000,,485,4.586206896551724

Gives details on his resistance to Japan joining the Axis and how he was promoted to command the combined fleet to keep him from being assassinated, The film is in Japanese with english subtitles. The transations are much more accurate than the ones for the movie Yamato were. There are war scenes, but this is not what I would call an action movie. If your a true student of WWII who wants to see a good biography on Yamamoto, then buy this. If you want an action war movie, then this is not for you.",1360368000,7,574,4.324074074074074

5368852,5,B009UHGSRI,"A great view, especially if you are at all interested in another view of the great leader .. ..

There are many views of ADMIRAL ISOROKU > He knew war with US was a folly after spending years in the US .. .. The war was dictated by the Army as well as national policy (see Germany in WWII & Iran today) .. ..

And, JAPAN was again embroiled in the last of three attempted coups by the start of WWII, so the attack on Pearl Harbor was actually a welcomed relief, unknowing what was to follow .. ..

When the final Japanese fundamentalist rebels were caught, and tried, in 1952, over 400 years of repeated civil unrest finally came to an end .. ..

I saw this movie on  return flight to the States from the UK and enjoyed it so much, that I watched it again before landing .. .. Maybe not a masterpiece, as other reviewers have said, but VERY GOOD and well-worth having a copy .. ..",1353542400,,880,4.12280701754386
5368853,2,B009UHGSRI,"This is a very disappointing film about a great and eminent man and leader of men. Life and achievements of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet of Japanese Imperial Navy from August 1939 to April 1943, deserved a much better film than this sugarcoated propaganda.

The film is not entirely without merits. In its first half it shows very accurately Yamamoto as a very lucid adversary of Japanese imperial expansion, as the Deputy-Minister of Navy and later as Commander-in Chief of Combined Fleet. Yamamoto indeed objected both against the war in China in 1937 and the joining of Tripartite Pact, feeling that those developments would cause an unavoidable conflict with United States - a war which he knew pretty well Japan had only limited chances to win. In taking very openly this stance he put his life at great risk, but never changed his mind. His courage and moral integrity were never in doubt and by insisting on this aspect this film does a good job.

Yamamoto as caring husband, loving father and loyal friend is also well shown in the first half of the film. His insistance on modernisation of the fleet and especially its carriers and planes and also his strict refusal of suicidal missions are also truly described. Finally, his correct appreciation of disappointing results of Pear Harbor attack, Nagumo's early retreat and moral effect of declaration of war delivered AFTER the attack took already place, all those element are true and they are well shown.

If only this film could have kept this quality level for all its duration, it could be an excellent and precious thing. Very SADLY, the second part of the film, beginning as soon as attack against Pearl Harbor ended, has hardly anything to do with history any more and is so abysmally bad, that it ruins the whole film.

It is since a long time an established consensus that past the first stage of conflict (after the triumphant Indian Ocean Raid in March and April 1942, not shown in this film) Yamamoto completely mismanaged the war - but you will not see ANY of those enormous errors in this pretty long film. You will certainly not see anything about the big mistake which was sending of only three carriers, divided in two groups, for operation against Port Moresby, allowing therefore Americans to engage them at battle of Coral Sea which was a bloody and messy draw, particularly costly for the Japanese.

You will not see anything even suggesting how terribly bad was Yamamoto's battle plan for the Midway campaign, which made certain that admiral Nagumo would have to fight Americans with only four carriers out of eight available. In order to absolve Yamamoto of all responsibility, this film prefers to blame some mysterious ""secret"" orders received by Nagumo from some unidentified official (most probably Admiral Nagano, Chief of Imperial Navy General Staff) before the battle.

Even worse, this film shows Yamamoto as a monument of stoic calm when during the battle of Midway he received news that ""Akagi"", ""Kaga"" and ""Soryu"" were hit and burning - in real life Yamamoto moaned in grief and almost collapsed, before suffering a complete meltdown during which he issued lots of completely absurd orders. Possibly the worst amongst those orders was the one sending four heavy cruisers (Cruiser Division 7) to shell Midway, without any air cover... After a couple of hours Yamamoto finally recovered his sanity and cancelled his orders - but it was already too late... As the result, heavy cruiser ""Mikuma"" was sunk by American planes (650 men from her crew died) and her twin, ""Mogami"", was crippled (and lost 81 more killed).

Things get even worse for Guadalcanal campaign, which was abysmally mismanaged by Yamamoto. His tendency to divide forces and his refusal to commit most of his battleships (and especially his hoarding of ""Yamato"", ""Musashi"", ""Nagato"" and ""Mutsu"" for some unspecified future ""decisive battle"") led to the situation in which Americans, who in autumn 1942 in the Pacific still were weaker than Japanese, could become STRONGER on the Guadalcanal front - and as the result they won this long and bloody campaign... But you will not see even a hint at it in this film...

Yamamoto's death on another hand was shown rather skillfully and truthfully. It is also a moving scene, as it should be...

There are other weaknesses in this film. CGI's are not very good and especially ""Yamato"" is shown in a very disappointing way. Battle scenes are rather pathetic and the way battle of Midway is shown is simply ridiculous. Actor playing admiral Tamon Yamaguchi looks 20 years too young - and definitely nothing like this gifted and brave commander looked in real life. Yamamoto never seems doing any real work or giving any real military orders - he just naps, plays some Japanese board game, eats sweats, jokes with his men and occasionally hugs little girls (I almost expected him to get a puppy or save some kittens from drowning...).

Dialogs in second part of the film make frequently no sense at all - but it may be partly because of weak English subtitles, which are by the way full of errors (at Midway we can hear about fighters being armed with torpedoes, we hear names of warships which never existed, etc.).

So bottom line, I believe that this film is a failure and is unworthy of such a great man. Because even if admiral Yamamoto proved to be finally a rather poor strategist (and an even worse tactician), he certainly was a courageous and noble man and he deserved to be shown in all his human complexity, with his strengths and flaws. Instead, makers of ""Admiral"" opted mostly for a sugarcoated, worshipping hagiography - and as a result they failed to produce a good film.",1351123200,46,5725,4.873586844809866

5368868,4,B009UHGSRI,"While I found this movie is very entertaining, and the CGI and music are excellent (for example, in a very touching scene in which Yamamoto salutes departing Zero fighter pilots he knows he is sending to their deaths while waving his cap), the movie takes a lot of liberties with history to create a quasi-hagiography of a 20th-Century figure for a 21st-Century Japan in need of a hero.

According to historians, the scene in which Yamamoto salutes his departing flyers did actually happen when he was in command of Operation I-Go at Rabaul, and he did have a reputation for caring for his men on a micro level.  His relationship with Admiral Yamaguchi Tamon was probably close to the way it was depicted, although Yamaguchi was significantly shorter and a lot less handsome (think guy who kind of looks like Mr. Potato-Head who works in the accounting department) than depicted.

However, the movie airbrushes the huge strategic mistakes he made (for example by blaming Midway primarily on Nagumo, where it was Yamamoto who blundered on a grand scale by separating his forces in the first place and by severely underestimating U.S. capabilities), the atrocities committed by those under his command (such as the execution of captured American flyers at Midway and the general level of brutality used by all sides during the Pacific campaign), his actual political ambitions (which likely influenced his anti-war sentiments, since they would cause harm to his political foes in the Army) and various unsavory aspects of his personal life (his constant womanizing and his love for a geisha he kept in Japan, which caused his family life to be a lot less happy than is depicted).  As others have remarked, the movie also takes significant liberties with the various historical events.

All that said, I was very entertained by the movie, and the kernel of basic truth remained.  Had Yamamoto's anti-war views triumphed, Japan could have avoided a great deal of bloodshed, but from the time Japan invaded China, war with the United States seemed foreordained.",1499990400,,2056,5.0146627565982405
5368869,1,B009UHGSRI,"I'm changing my review for this item. First off it took almost two months to get the DVD to me. 2nd it was in PAL format and being a videographer I know the difference. I don't remember it saying PAL when I ordered but maybe I made a mistake.

The real reason I'm changing my opinion of this movie, and after serious study of the subject, the movie makers created a story about Yamamoto and the IJN totally distorted from actual History. In reality he wasn't a low key good family man. The actual man sought, and thrived on, fame and the perks rank brought to him. He loved playing around with the geisha's, drinking, and gambling like all of the Japanese Military Leaders. The Movie makes him out to be a saint.

They also Lie about the events surrounding Midway. Yamamoto OK'ed a terrible plane that split his forces sending two carriers groups to the Aleutian Islands for a meaningless operation which left them to far away to support the Midway group. He knowingly let Nagumo go forward with conflicting orders to both attack Midway and also keep a reserve ready to attach USN carriers even tho he and everyone knew they didn't have the planes available to suppress Midway Island with just one attack.

The preparation/training for Midway was terrible. Yamamoto had contempt for the fighting abilities of Americans, he sent his one surviving carrier closer to the USN strike groups even tho the safe thing to do was send it farther away because IJN airplanes had more range. I could go on and on but the simply fact is Yamamoto was not the peace loving genius the movie makes him out to be.

Waiting for this DVD I finally was able to watch the entire movie elswhere so it doesnt bother me so much to toss it in the garbage, which I have to do cause my players are NTSC. If you live in America make sure you don't buy the PAL version. There is one decent scene at the end when the P-38s set upon his Betty bomber transport but that doesnt take away that the movie is propaganda and dealing with this seller was a bad experience.",1496793600,,2032,4.454301075268817

This movie portrays the personal side of Admiral Yamamoto and his struggle to avoid war with the USA.  While I enjoyed the movie, I must caution that this is historical fiction.

In the Battle of Midway, it completely ignores the American Torpedo Planes which caused the Japanese fighters to come down to defend the carriers.  This left the skies above the carriers free for the Dive Bombers to attack.  There is no record of any Japanese planes deliberately crashing into the USS Yorktown.  It accurately depicted Admiral Yamamoto wearing a green uniform instead of his dress whites <which I thought he was wearing> when his plane was shot down.
  The movie is shown from the point of view of a Japanese newspaper reporter and that is another plus.  To look at the whole lifestyle from outside the perspective of the military is a good change.",1461801600,,792,4.779411764705882
