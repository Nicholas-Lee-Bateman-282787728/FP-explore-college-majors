3916516,2,B002EAYDNY,"""Along the Great Divide"" is a 1951 black and white Raoul Walsh Western starring Kirk Douglas, Virginal Mayo, Walter Brennan, and John Agar. The film is basically as ""who done it"" set against harsh terrain, and angry lynch mob, and treachery.

Kirk Douglas (1916) plays a Marshall in his first turn in a western. He was a rising star at the time, Oscar nominated for ""Champion"" (1949) and memorable roles in ""Out of the Past"" (1947) and ""Young Man with a Horn"" (1950).  Following this film he would be Oscar nominated for ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" in 1952, and ""Lust for Life"" in 1957, and win the Golden Glove for ""Lust for Life"". He appears as #17 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.

Douglas' co-star is the beautiful Virginia Mayo (1920-2005). She's best remembered for her role opposite Jimmy Cagney in ""White Heat"" (1949), one of more than 50 films she starred in. Mayo had an interesting career, often playing ""not the girl next door"", although I liked her best in comedies like ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947) and ""The Princess and the Pirate"" (1944).

Walter Brennan (1894-1974) plays a man suspected of rustling. He won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor - ""Come and Get it"" (1936), ""Kentucky"" (1938), ""The Westerner"" (1941) - and was nominated for his work in ""Sergeant York"" (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"", and his film comedies (""The Over the Hill Gang"") or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"", but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in ""The Westerner"" (1940), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), and again In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962).

Handsome John Agar (1921-2002) co-stars as Douglas' deputy. Agar  is best known for his films with John Wayne in the 40s (""Sands of Iwo Jima"", ""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""), where he met his first wife, Shirley Temple.

Ray Teal (1902-76) plays another deputy. Teal made more than 100 films but is best known for his role as the no-nonsense Sheriff in Bonanza (1959-73).

Stern faced Morris Ankrum (1897-1964) plays a wealthy rancher whose son was murdered. Ankrum played in more than 200 films, mostly westerns, but is probably best known for his role as Dr. Fleming from ""Rocketship X-M"" (1950) and as Col. Fielding in ""Invaders from Mars"" (1953).

Raoul Walsh (1887-1980) directs. Though he's probably best known for his films with Errol Flynn, he was a master of the melodrama - ""Roaring Twenties"" (1939), ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""High Sierra"" (1941) and ""White Heat"" (1949) - and westerns - ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941), ""Colorado Territory"" (1949), ""The Lawless Breed"" (1953), ""The Tall Men"" (1955). He declined noticeably in the 50s after he left Warner Brothers, but his 50+ year career made him one of Hollywood's most memorable directors.

Sid Hickox (1895-1982) handles the camera. Hickox made hundreds of films for Warner's and transitioned to TV in the 50s where he worked on ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show"". Though never nominated for any award, his camerawork was good, and he was responsible for films such as ""God is my Co-Pilot"" (1945), ""White Heat"" (1949), and my Hickox favorite, ""Dark Passage"" (1947). Hickox worked with Walsh on several films including ""Edge of Darkness"" (1943), ""Uncertain Glory"" (1944) and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942). His work in this film is crisp and attractive, and his studio shots are well integrated into the on-location backgrounds.

Bosley Crowther of The NY Times called it ""a solemn sagebrush saga"" and ""a routine western, second grade."" He was particularly disapponted with Douglas  whose performance he described as ""just a little shy of absurd.""

1951 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were ""Quo Vadis"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Show Boat"", ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and ""David and Bathsheba"". Oscars went to ""The Quiet Man"" (Director), ""High Noon"" (Actor), ""Come Back Little Sheba"" (Actress), ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Picture), and ""Viva Zapata"" (Supporting Actor).  Other notable releases that year included ""The African Queen"",  ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Murder Inc"", and ""A Place in the Sun"".

Bottom line - This is a pretty ordinary B western, shot mostly in the studio, and notable only as Kirk Douglas' first western.",1319328000,4,4319,4.903978052126201
3916517,4,B002EAYDNY,"Kirk Douglas made more thna his share of great Westerns, and Along The Great Divide was one of them.

This was his first Western,and he gets off to a rousing start by portraying a US Marshal who saves cattle rustler Walter Brennan from hanging and has to cross the Mojave with him, his deputies, a feisty woman played by Virginia Mayo, and the lyncher's gunmen in tow. There's lot to enjoy here. Action, surprises, and a little psychodrama thrown in for good measure that does not distract or detract from the story. Along The Great Divide is a great movie.",1268956800,11,557,4.57
3916518,5,B002EAYDNY,"ALONG THE GREAT DIVIDE is a fascinating character study Western, with Kirk Douglas after his man (Walter Brennan), and through it all, revealing as much about himself as about the man he is bringing to justice. Fine acting all round; excellent dialogue, and engrossing all the way. Highly recommended.",1249862400,8,301,5.163265306122449
3916519,4,B002EAYDNY,actually Amazon and Warner have entered into an agreement for the resale of these titles through Amazon.  Though they are cheaper at the wb website.,1245715200,7,148,4.92
3916520,3,B002EAYDNY,"If you love westerns this one is worth watching almost in spite of itself. Walter Brennan steals the show here, proving why he won 3 Oscars over his long career. Virginia Mayo was always underrated perhaps because her looks were so flawless and, yes, she does a great job but looks too good for the role.

Kirk Douglas struggles a bit. First, he cannot mount a horse properly and has similar problems finding his character. But much of this can be blamed on the script which is uneven at times. Wardrobe bears a share of the blame, giving him heavily starched, perfectly form fitting shirts in every scene that make willing suspension of disbelief nearly impossible.

Nonetheless you stay emotionally involved largely due to Brennan and Mayo.",1442188800,3,742,4.834645669291339

3916523,4,B002EAYDNY,"After catching the last 20 minutes of this while channel surfing I had to buy the DVD.
It's got some teeth but it's also humane. I've never seen this film and have to admit it's up there with Hombre and Hondo. It's shot in black and white but it's still atmospheric, featuring some of the best southwestern landscapes to grace the cinema. Kirk Douglas paired with a cunning but sympathetic Virginia Mayo was an excellent casting choice. Walter Brennan is a cagy old owl hoot that Douglas, playing an area lawman saves from a lynching. He's going to bring him in so the local magistrate can put him on trial for the murder he's accused of, that of a local, angrily determined rancher's son. Mayo is the culprit's daughter and she means to see her father freed. It's a long trip to the territory's county seat and human nature on the trail is always too flexible.
This is one of those westerns with a good, solid story, an excellent cast and chemistry that makes it all work. I know this is a keeper.",1438387200,,998,4.459016393442623

8367151,3,B002EAYDNY,"Its OK, However, I don't like watching westerns where the TERRITORIAL marshal is the hero. In real life, Territorial jurisdiction has encroached on free states and become a terrible nemesis to a free people. Americans have been dumbed down by movies like this - and in fact it was probably implemented back in the day to start the process of inculcating Americans to think US Government is all powerful. Just go back and watch all the movies that have territorial marshals. You will see jurisdiction touched on in those movies. You can see that Territorial government (think of the territories formed by the NW ordinance, and the Arizona Territory and so forth.) had a completely different style of government than the way individual States were run. Once a state was carved out of a Territory, the US jurisdiction was supposed to end. Many times it did, if the state legislatures were savvy AND honest. Bottom line, these movies are very educational, if you know what to look for.",1455148800,,981,4.845238095238095
