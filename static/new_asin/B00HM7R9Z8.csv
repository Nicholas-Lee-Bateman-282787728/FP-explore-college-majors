8633438,3,B00HM7R9Z8,"I'm sure this was a lot of fun in 1928. It probably got overlooked because it was silent and not even a ""part talkie"". Bebe inherits a sanitarium and pays it a visit. The joint is a front for bootleggers. William Powell is one, and he displays the same fine physical comedy he would later in his a career. OK for the price. The print is pretty ratty.",1393718400,6,350,4.161764705882353
8633439,4,B00HM7R9Z8,"Here we have a fun silent comedy about bootleggers with Bebe Daniels.  Also Richard Arlen and William Powell as the bootleggers.  The Grapevine edition looks quite good for being unrestored which is probably best since we get all the original titles.  Extra is a short titled ""Lines Busy"".",1382745600,8,289,4.979166666666667
