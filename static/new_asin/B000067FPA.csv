1715427,4,B000067FPA,I have always been a fan of R.L. Stine. My children and I would watch the shows when they were younger. We liked the suspence and far out tales.  This is not for younger children though.,1216425600,,186,4.166666666666667

1715430,5,B000067FPA,This is a great movie for kids and adults who enjoy watching suspenseful and somewhat scary movies. It is not bloody or gory and yet it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Watch it with your kids late at night.,1176336000,,211,4.023809523809524
1715431,5,B000067FPA,"A wonderful addition to any DVD collection.  R.L. Stine, the man behind the ""Goosebumps"" legacy, has returned with this collection of tales from his ""The Nightmare Room"" series.  This disc features four episodes from the television series.  The episodes in question are ""Camp Nowhere"" (Parts 1 & 2), ""Don't Forget Me"" and ""Full Moon Halloween.""  ""Camp Nowhere"" sees Russel, Dave, Erin, and Charlotte attend Camp Hawkwood.  The campfire story depicts a ghost-camp.  In a routine initiation the four experience the `story' first-hand.  Will they escape alive?  In ""Don't Forget Me"" a family moves into a new house.  Danielle is left to look after her brother Peter when the parents go away.  To make him a better brother, Danielle decides to hynotize Peter, who then begins to act strange.  Does this have anything to do with the calls from the basement or is it a hynotization gone wrong?  Lastly, in ""Full Moon Halloween"" a rumoured werewolf is attacking people.  An invite to a surprise Halloween party for five friends soon turns into a game of `Who is the werewolf?' Will everybody pass, fail, or is it all a hoax?  Each of the episodes are excellently scripted and are great stories.  The episodes even feature familiar faces....faces such as Amanda Bynes (Big Fat Liar), Sam Jones III & Allison Mack (Smallville), Frankie Muniz (Malcolm In The Middle), Madeline Zima (The Nanny) + a few others.  In term of the special features, they are quite excellent as well.  Aside from trailers from other Warner Brothers titles, an an intervew with R.L. Stine entitled ""The Nightmare Files,"" there is a bravery test of our darkest fears in ""Do You Dare,"" and lastly a choose-your-own-adventure type of interactive game with ""The Nightmare is Yours:Sink or Swim"" where you decide your fate.  I recommend that this disc be picked up because the stories and features are things that people of all ages would enjoy.  So please don't forget to venture into ""The Nightmare Room"" or else ""The Nightmare Room"" will venture into you!  :-)",1043539200,21,2024,4.931952662721893

Stines best work, used to be on Sat. morning cartoon block before it was canceled some time in the early 2000's I think or late 90's.

7962878,2,B000067FPA,"i never knew this show existed until i saw it online a few years ago. its made by rl stine the guy who made goosebumps and the haunting hour. i could never get into this series. it would start off creepy but then end flat or on a odd cliffhanger. i like goosebumps and haunting hour better. ok i gave it 2 out of 5 stars cuz even though i don't like this series, this dvd eps r a bit better than the other dvd. these eps actually seem a bit more creepy and don't end on such a flat note. aww it has amanda baynes back when she was sane.",1414886400,,536,3.8378378378378377

7962880,5,B000067FPA,"My son started collecting R.L. Stine when he was about 8.  He really enjoyed this book and it really does give him a fright.  So, he was able to tell me, he enjoyed it, but, beware, it does scare them enough for bad dreams.  Everyone in my family enjoys something scary, so even though, he still asks for more.",1390521600,,310,4.220338983050848

7962883,3,B000067FPA,"I continue on my path to see how some of my favorite actors got their start with another volume of R.L. Stein's, The Nightmare Room. The show is basically Tales From The Crypt for kids, telling short, creepy stories with a twist for kids. Once again I found the series very enjoyable. I love seeing some of my favorite actors and actresses before they were household names and I found the stories quite fun. It was written for kids, but everyone will enjoy these!",1361491200,,463,4.523809523809524
