2457805,3,B000CCZRBI,"If you are looking to own the DoCo music videos that were the original opening and endings to the OAVs, you will not find them here. Viz completely left them out of this smaller set, which is an EXTREME dissapointment to me, since that was half of the reason why I liked the OAVs so much. Bad form, Viz. Bad form.

They also chose to arrange the discs in the same case, stacked on top of each other, which always makes me worry about scratches and the like. Not happy with this set up at all.

But if you just want a review of the actual content, the Ranma OAVs are wonderful. Probably the only ""episodes"" of the series that I could still sit down and enjoy with no worries.",1143849600,27,674,4.176923076923077
2457826,3,B000CCZRBI,"The Ranma 1/2 OAV Series DVD set has two discs that include all twelve OAV episodes released for the series.  Each disc contains six episodes.  The first disc has: ""Shampoo's Sudden Switch - The Curse of the Contrary Jewel,"" ""Tendo Family Christmas Scramble,"" ""Akane vs. Ranma! I'll Be the One to Inherit Mother's Recipes!,"" ""Stormy Weather Comes to School! Growing Up With Miss Hinako,"" and both parts of ""The One to Carry On.""  The second disc has: both parts of ""Reawakening Memories,"" ""Team Ranma vs. The Legendary Phoenix,"" ""Oh, Cursed Tunnel of Lost Love! Let My Love Be Forever,"" ""The Evil Ogre! Hell Hath No Fury Like Kasumi Scorned,"" and ""The Two Akanes! `Ranma, Look at Me!'.""

Most of the episodes included in this set are very enjoyable, and include the humor that is expected from Ranma 1/2.  The animation quality is also noticeably better than the animation in the regular series episodes.  However, I was rather disappointed that there are absolutely no special features included in the set.  On the one hand, I understand that since six episodes are included on each disc, there really wouldn't have been room for any special features.  If it had been up to me, I would have made the Ranma 1/2 OAV Series box set a three-disc set, where each disc had four episodes and some special features.  Also, I was disappointed that Viz Media decided not to subtitle the opening theme song that appears on the second disc of the set.

The Ranma 1/2 OAV Series DVD box set sells at retail outlets for about $45, which is basically the same price the season box sets sell for.  While I enjoy Ranma 1/2, I think Viz Media is charging too much for the OAV series box, especially for what you get.  If you're a Ranma 1/2 fan, then you need to get the OAV series box set in order to complete your Ranma 1/2 DVD collection.  However, I would recommend seeing if you can find it for a better price, either because a retail outlet regularly sells it for a lower price, or the set is lowered during a sales promotion.",1243296000,,2014,4.576601671309192
2457827,4,B000CCZRBI,Ranma 1/2 is one of the must see anime to watch if you're a fan. I know there are new fans and still growing but if you guys want to know where it grew from. Ranma 1/2 is one of them. Check out the series.,1240790400,,205,3.577777777777778
2457828,4,B000CCZRBI,"This series seemed to fall in with the original TV series where it leaves off. If you liked the original TV series then you will probably like the OVA as well. It is a little pricey since you only get 12 episodes so I can't give it a five out of five. If you are watching the seven seasons of Ranma 1/2 make sure you finish them before you watch the OVA because a character introduced at the end of season 7 (The last season) is in the OVA. It did feel a little weird that each of the two disks have different openings and closings making it feel more like two small OVA series then one OVA series. Another note about the openings and closings, the first disks closing seems way too long because they have the song then the credits instead of the credits during the song like every else does.",1232928000,,792,4.183006535947713
2457829,4,B000CCZRBI,"This comes with a ""special collector's postcard set"", consisting of 6 postcards with full-color art. Not to mention the 'pin-up' of female Ranma on the back of the table of contents insert!
Postcard 1 is Christmas themed, centering on boy! Ranma carrying Akane for some reason while random Christmas things go on in the background.
Postcard 2 is Shampoo daydreaming of marrying Ranma in an elaborate ceremony.",1217808000,,409,5.119402985074627
2457830,5,B000CCZRBI,"ok this box set is everything that people said it would be, i don't know about ranma at its best but the Ovas are very very good and if your a big ranma fan this is a must HAVE!!and if not then you should still get this i loved every episode of this, its had some super funny/romantic episodes,oh yea and before i got this people said that ranma expressed his true felling for akane in this and that is not completely true on the last episode of the he tells her about everything excepetd he loves her its still really good, o and this is supost to be the closher of ranma i supost to go like the TV series,then the movies,then the oavs but this.had no closher to it if you the real ending then read the manga ending,aslo this comes with 5 ranma post cards!!!",1199145600,,759,4.135135135135135
2457831,5,B000CCZRBI,"Both of Ranma 1/2 movies are great.  They both deal with someone abducting Akane.  If I had to choose I would say the 2nd movie was better.  Mainly because of the fights at the end.  All of the main characters get to battle one of the bad guys.

The first movie deals with Akane being kidnapped by the cult of pickle worshipers...I am serious.  Ranma has to battle all each of the 7 lucky god's martial artists.  The movie is slow at the beginning, but picks up past towards the middle.

The second movie is about Akane being kidnapped by a young prince.  The main cast has been stranded on a deserted island.  The twist in this movie is he kidnaps every women he sees and pits them in a contest for his hand in marriage.  This movie has some great fan service.  The girls have on some of the most revealing bathing suits you will ever see.  Ukyou is the standout winner on this front.

I know there must be a little concern over the price.  $49 for 2 movies?  In context it isn't an unreasonable price.  When they first came out on VHS is was $34.99 per movie.  I know because I paid that.  I have seen the price as low at $42 on this site.  It may seem like a lot but your getting your getting your money's worth.",1194393600,4,1215,4.155172413793103
2457832,5,B000CCZRBI,"I have watched every episode of Ranma 1/2 and I can state for a fact that the OAV's are the best of all the episodes.  They took the best of the manga (at the time) and turned them into a great anime OAV series.  If you liked the first season you will really like this set.

The only exception to this would be the ""Fake OAV"" that is towards the end.  The one that deals with Kuno and the egg.  I say it's a fake because it's really the 3rd movie, but it was so terrible and really short (only 40 minutes I believe).  To be fair to the 3rd movie, the manga version of this story is just as bad, and I have no idea why they would pick this story to be the 3rd movie.  There were so many others that could have been so much better (Herb storyline for one).

If your look for closure of the tv series here, I'm sorry but there isn't any.  However the OAV's do a good job of trying to continue the story.  Buy this set now!",1190160000,,919,3.89247311827957
2457833,5,B000CCZRBI,"If you're looking for a super-violent porn cartoon (as MST3K called them), this show is not for you.  But if your looking for a zany comedy with real character development this show is the best thing you could get from Japan.  The OVA's have noticeably better animation than the show itself, as these were independently produced.  My wife and I watch them over and over again on a regular basis.  Think of it as a sitcom with the unlimited possibilities of an animation.  Definitely a great start for anyone interested in the series.",1183593600,3,533,4.688172043010753
2457834,5,B000CCZRBI,"How could I possibly finish my reviews of Ranma 1/2 without mention the 12 OVA episodes that followed the show? These 12 episodes pick up right where we left off. Ranma and the gang are still growing together and getting into the usual...until these 12 episodes came along that is.

These episodes truly stand alone from the origional TV series. For one the animation is brilliant and much more fluid that the TV show, but thats how it goes with the quality factor. What truly sets these 12 episodes up on the pedestil is the intensity that is brought with each incredible half hour. There isn't much room for cheap laughs here. There is everything from giant 7 headed dragons to baby phoenixes, enchanted murderous dolls and even a huge christmas party that has an ending that will make you want to hold that special someone close to you.

Finally this is the moment in time where we get one step closer to the bond of Ranma and Akane at this stage in life Ranma lets the world and the viewers know exactly how he feels about Akane. So prepare for the action the laughs and yes the many tears that are shead as you watch the final 12 special adventures of Ranma 1/2. (Trust me you can skip the movies)

8097702,5,B000CCZRBI,One of the Best Anime of all time! Although I hope it gets a reboot after the blu ray releases because I would totally pay for that just like I am buying the manga and anime.,1423180800,,174,3.861111111111111
8097703,4,B000CCZRBI,"This is a series of ""extra"" Ranma episodes.  About 12 episodes are included on the two-disc set.  Some of them are quite funny and all are worth a watch.",1409616000,,153,4.241379310344827
8097704,4,B000CCZRBI,"The movies are extensions of the popular TV show and are relatively short with thin plots.  Something Ranma does gets misinterpreted and things showball from there.  However, the transfer quality and sound were pretty good and laughs were to be had.  This isn't great enough to earn 5 stars but it was fairly entertaining.  Among some of the funnier aspects were the easy availability of both hot and cold water in remote locations on a moment's notice.",1409270400,,453,4.8441558441558445

The only problem I have is that for these 12 episodes they brought Sarah Strange back for male Ranma's voice. I much preferred Richard Ian Cox. I am just glad that I got these for such an Enormous discout, Sarah Strange or not!",1309219200,,402,4.302631578947368
8097708,3,B000CCZRBI,"Unless I got the boxset location of the episodes wrong, wasn't the episode where Ranma loses his memories and thinks he's REALLY a girl, and the episode where the gang travel back in time 300 years and meet young Cologne and Happosai a part of the OVA's?",1280880000,,254,4.425531914893617
8097709,4,B000CCZRBI,"I always thought the humor in this show was way ahead of its time. Sometimes when u watch an older anime, the humor is REALLY outdated and hard to actually laugh at. But throughout the show and movies I just LAUGHED. Definitely worth getting if your looking for a comedy-anime (plus, i've always been a sucker 4 the damsel in distress plot).",1259539200,,341,4.516129032258065
8097710,3,B000CCZRBI,"The Ranma 1/2 Movie DVD Box Set is a two disc set.  The first disc contains the first Ranma 1/2 movie, Big Trouble in Nekonron, China.  The second disc contains the second Ranma 1/2 movie, Nihao My Concubine.  However, neither disc contains any special features.

While the films themselves were very enjoyable, I was disappointed that all this two disc set had were the movies.  The runtime for the first film is 81 minutes, and the runtime for the second film is 59 minutes.  With such short runtimes, both films could have easily fit onto one disc.  However, between releasing the films in a two-disc box set, and not including any special features, it comes across that Viz Media was more interested in finding a way to be able to charge as much as possible and not put much effort into the release.  By putting the films into a two-disc set, Viz Media seemed to feel they were justified to charge the same amount for this set as for the episode box sets.  Personally, I feel that the set, as it is now, is a ripoff.

While I enjoy Ranma 1/2, I think Viz Media is charging too much for this set.  If you are a Ranma 1/2 fan and want to have everything on DVD, then you do need to acquire this set to complete your collection.  However, I would recommend seeing if you can find it for a better price, either because a retail outlet regularly sells it for a lower price, or the set is lowered during a sales promotion.  Or, as a last resort, you can always wait for the price to fall naturally, because the set has been out for a long enough time that Viz Media feels they've gotten as many sales as they can at the higher price.  However, it could still be a couple of years before that happens, so you might have to wait a while for that option.",1256601600,,1749,4.2926829268292686
8097711,4,B000CCZRBI,"I've seen this movies plenty of times, and they are, of course, 'very Ranma'. Nothing new here but I would really apreciatte some subtitles in other languages other than english. Portuguese, french or spanish at least.",1252713600,,218,5.083333333333333
