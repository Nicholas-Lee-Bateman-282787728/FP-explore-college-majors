2052452,4,B00020HAI8,"This is a cheesy, but funny movie you will want on the shelf for a good laugh.  The acting is bad, but you will find yourself trying to talk like the nerd by the end of the movie.  The first half of the movie is hilarious as the nerd tries to learn to be cool.  I have liked this movie since it came out and recently added it to my DVD collection and have watched it several times since.  The DVD also comes with the sequel, which is so-so, but if you didn't get enough from the first movie, Bride of Killer Nerd picks up right where Killer Nerd leaves off.  Parts of the movie are slow, but in the end, I think you will appreciate what the filmmakers have done on a small budget, a crummy camera, and a few bad actors (I think Toby Radloff did a great job...I can't think of a better nerd for any amount of money).  This is a nice package and I think most any troma fan or fan of cheesy funny horror movies would enjoy owning it.",1104537600,13,930,4.0
2052453,2,B00020HAI8,"At the risk of being non PC (although isn't that what Troma are all about?), I have to ask.....is Toby Radloff mentally retarded or just the worst actor in the history of television & cinema?

Personally, I hope it's the former, because he does seem like a nice guy.

Seriously though, if you know a tree that can talk then it'll be less wooden than poor old Toby, the self confessed 'nerd'. Even the robot in the original series of Lost In Space acts with more personality & feeling than him!",1099872000,,493,4.406593406593407
8019506,1,B00020HAI8,Terrible B-Movie. There are much better out there. Avoid this one.,1519689600,,66,5.090909090909091
8019507,3,B00020HAI8,"The Killer Nerd movies will be given one star by some review posters. People will say how the acting is terrible, the direction sucks, the story is stupid, etc. They may be right. But to me these micro-budget movies somehow work anyway.

I am by no means a big fan of the Troma outfit, but in this case they have released a weird winner with this double feature including extras.

One of the key factors here is Tony Radloff's lead ""performance"". Radloff is playing a character only in the sense that he is acting out a fictional script. Aside from that, he seems to be playing himself. He is in fact the nerdy personage we see on the screen, even proudly so, and this is affirmed by his appearances in other movies by director Harold, such as ""Townies.""

Take this sort of acting, which can really only be found in the independent low-budget world, and add the film's rough, learn-as-you-go dimensions, and you've got the formula for a kind of shot-on-video madness that appeals to at least some of us.

With the exception of a brief acid-in-the-face scene in Killer Nerd, most of the ""gore"" here is entertainingly amateurish at best. The lighting is sometimes dubious. The pacing can be atrocious. But I have watched these movies often and enjoyed Radloff and Harold's commentaries as well. It is like watching underground cinematic chaos in action, like watching scenes from this world as filtered through a camera lens of extreme eccentricity. Or, maybe just through a lens that has not been trained into sterility like mainstream ones.

The ""awfulness"" of some of the scenes in Killer Nerd may seem that way because viewers have been conditioned to watch movies in a certain way. If they relax, free their minds from such constraints and allow for the possibility that ""awfulness"" may simply mean ""outside of the usual, with no budget,"" then there may be much pleasure to be had here.

Another factor here is the way movies like this seem to take a childlike pleasure in the shooting of the simplest scenes. With all of the initial joy of a kid taking pictures, scenes here seem to linger on the most everyday objects and matters more than most mainstreams ever would, and this is something that this viewer, at least, finds appreciable.

Not all such movies will be gratifying to all viewers, but all such movies are going to be far outside of the movie-making business machine  -  and entirely original in their ""awfulness.""",1474502400,,2431,4.741706161137441
8019508,4,B00020HAI8,"I've probably put this film on a hundred times.  It's the kind of movie that I leave on in the background while I'm working.  It doesn't have a very solid plot and the production quality is terrible, but there's a certain low-budget charm to it that I can't deny. If you enjoy low budget, ""backyard style"" films, you'll probably get a kick out of Killer Nerd.  Check out Part II (Bride of Killer Nerd) for a better cinematic experience though.",1472169600,,443,4.5125
8019509,1,B00020HAI8,"Disturbing piece of garbage. I wonder if that is what the teenagers that are killing others today are feeling. Some people are so mean, Both extremes were shown here: hateful punks calling different people nerds and the so called ""nerds"" killing them..How SAD.",1469232000,,260,5.069767441860465
8019510,3,B00020HAI8,"I couldn't tell if it was crap or genius.  To the credit of the movie, I did keep watching it to the end.  It reminded me of a very low-budget Eraserhead.",1469059200,,154,3.935483870967742
8019511,5,B00020HAI8,"Very hard to watch. Slow. Corny horror. I mean, what do you expect with a title like this. But I think you should watch it because I did.",1458000000,,137,3.9285714285714284
8019512,5,B00020HAI8,"Not a 5 for anything but sheer unashamed freak factor schlock.  So bizarre it deserves Cult Film after it,  but I doubt it will ever end up in any film school as any kind of an example film for students.  Lots of films make you feel this way or that way  this leaves you feeling a very strange sort of numb or dumb, as the case may be  but too twisted to stop watching.  Can people really be this cruel to others  yes.  Would nerdy type people ever mis-fire a brain synapse from the abuse and become Killer Nerds?  Maybe not this way, but with the school-bully-retaliation shootings these last several years  yeah, possible.  In both films the heroes are so picked on, you cannot blame them.  And to do a SPOILER alert  the scene on the Bride Nerd segment where she describes to the person what she is gonna do AFTER she slices them up, was way creep-out factor.  Bad thing is, you might watch these now and then, but only if you are really in a very strange mood.  And it is a mood I don't want to be in, very often.  We had a smaller Ma & Pa video store that used to rent this type of film and I don't know if the mainstream rental places even carry it  so unless you get a real good price, rent it off the $1.00 for 5 nights shelf.  Otherwise, go ahead and order it and roll the old dice.",1362355200,2,1291,4.075697211155378
8019513,4,B00020HAI8,"If you are a TROMA FILMS fanatic, then KILLER NERD / BRIDE OF KILLER NERD belong in your schlocky cheeeze collection! KILLER NERD is a humour-filled revenge movie, w/ Toby Radloff in the title role (playing Harold Kunkle). Radloff's performance is not just wooden, it's downright petrified! And yet, he makes it work in some way, filling KN w/ one jaw-dropper after another! Kunkle's eventual spree of bloody vengeance is truly silly. BRIDE OF KILLER NERD takes the emphasis off of Harold, and puts it on Sally (Heidi Lohr), as Harold's new girlfriend. Sally is equally backward, and every bit as socially excluded as Harold. Her ultimate transformation into a murderous maniac is a wonder to behold! BRIDE is a tad darker than KN, making it seem more interesting than it was probably meant to be. As always, expect terrible acting, zero-budget production, and a lot of goofy, gory fun...",1351468800,,888,4.926666666666667
8019514,4,B00020HAI8,"This double feature of Nerd/Bride of Nerd is a classic in the Troma collection. It's like Revenge of the Nerds on meth. Insane, violent, cheesy as can be, its Killer Nerd.... Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!",1308787200,,252,4.75
8019515,4,B00020HAI8,"Great DVD set for Toby Radloff fans. The original Killer Nerd is a classic cheesy ""horror"" flick. The bonus of the second movie is alright, but not great. The 'Bride' is only 55 minutes long!",1165622400,4,191,4.485714285714286
