8582231,5,B00CIWS5U0,"What can I say?  I've been watching Time Team for years wherever I could find it.  Nice to have some of the DVDs.  ROKU has an excellent selection of many of the series, but they made well over 200 programs and I have probably only been able to find about half of those.  Since they are no longer in production--there is no way to contact their production company.  All emails I send go un-responded to.  So we in America are not given full access to this amazing repository of archaeological digs, and the unparalleled contributions of Mick Aston, Phil Harding, Francis Pryor and the whole Time Team Gang--who seem like my best friends.  What an amazing concept and execution of a 20-year ""class"" in Ancient Britain.  Fortunately there are several books written by Mick and Pryor and about Time Team, so we can revisit them any time.  Oh I would have LOVED to be on just one of those digs.  WOW!  The DVDs are the next best thing to ""being there.""",1494028800,,948,4.485380116959064
