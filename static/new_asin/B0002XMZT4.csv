2137148,1,B0002XMZT4,"I viewed this movie with a friend and we both agreed.... this was the worst movie we EVER saw.  The ""acting"" was horrible. And the fight scenes had us rolling with laughter.  The sole redeeming factor of this film was that it was a stroll down fashion memory lane.  We lied and denied that we ever wore clothes like that in the 70's (LOL - yes we did!)",1393113600,4,352,4.147058823529412
2137149,2,B0002XMZT4,"This is one of the early Blaxploitation films.  The writing, production quality, locations, settings, and acting is just low budget. Normally, one of the highlights of any Blaxploitation film are the Kung Fu style fight scenes.  This movie even managed to make that low budget. It had some of the worst choreographed fight scenes that I ever saw. After I figured out that this was not going to be of the same quality as a Coffy or Foxy Brown, I just decided to enjoy it for what it was worth (i.e., an opportunity to see the fashion and mannerisms of people in the 70s).",1388188800,4,570,4.471153846153846
2137150,3,B0002XMZT4,I ORDERED THIS MOVIE FOR MY AUNTIE. THIS IS THE SECOND COPY. THE FIRST COPY WAS SENT BACK BECAUSE IT WAS ON VHS TAPE. (NOT WHAT SHE WANTED) THEN I ORDERED A 2ND COPY FOR THE DISC PLAYER. IT ARRIVED IN TIMELY FASHION. I FINALLY SAW THE  MOVIE IT WAS OK TO ME. (I'M NOT INTO ALL BLACK EXPLO MOVIES) BUT AS EXPECTED SHE FOUND A COMPLAINT. IT HAS THAT GRAVEL LOOK LIKE IT WAS RECORED FROM A DIRTY COPY. THAT IS NOT SETTING WELL WITH HER AND SHE WANTS TO SENT IT BACK. BUT AS OF TODAY I HAVE NOT HERD ANY THING. SO I GUESS SHE WILL KEEP. BUT OVER ALL I LOVE AMAZON.COM AND WILL CONTINUE SHOPPING.,1339545600,,591,3.925
2137151,4,B0002XMZT4,"Velvet Smooth is an often forgot gem of Blacksploitation films.
If you like Shaft and Coffey, you will love the world of Velvet Smooth.

What ever happened to Mike and Jan Fink and the Schild brothers?",1334620800,2,201,4.583333333333333

2137154,3,B0002XMZT4,"So bad. Atrocious. The worst fight scenes ever. If you love Blaxsploitation  you'll love it - for how truly low budget a film can be. I've seen better acting in porn movies, and better film on teeth ! Hilarious.",1197331200,5,211,4.410256410256411
2137155,2,B0002XMZT4,"Some will tell you this is a bad movie. heck, almost everybody will. And it IS a bad movie, but there are different flavours of bad.

I like movies about chicks fighting. (What can I say? Love me them strong female role models.) There are lots and lots of fights in here, and lots of guys getting beat up by Velvet Smooth (played by Johnnie Hill) and her partners in detective work.

What really ruins this movie is the DVD. The picture transfer is the worst I have ever seen. Lots of material seems to be missing; the movie begins and ends abruptly, with hardly any lead-in or fade-out; I could almost swear that they did not get to the end of the flick, just stopped when they ran out of the $1 they were budgeted.

The subtitles don't work. If you are the hearing-impaired (I certainly am), you need the subtitles if you are to have any chance of spotting a plotline. The thing says it has subtitles, but when you turn them on, no text appears (not even white text on a mostly white background -- I hate it when people do that, but we don't even get that much).

No extras in this one (what would they do for a making-of featurette? Show Johnnie Hill being worked on by her acting coach?). Hopefully, there will be no Special Edition or Director's Cut of this movie.

But, at least I got to see some chicks in fight scenes. Since I couldn't follow the plot and read what people were saying, instead I tried counting how many times they hit a guy in the groin. I spotted forty-six (no lie!). Is that sick and hilarious or is that just a bad movie?",1144022400,7,1549,4.273037542662116

2137160,1,B0002XMZT4,"When I saw this, I thought it could be similar to the old Pam Grier movies or Cleopatra Jones . Boy, was I wrong. I understand that this movie was made in the 1970s but the picture images was horrible. I rented an old Pam Grier movie also made in the 70s and the picture was very clear. The action scenes in this movie was extremely amateurish as well as the dialogue. Don't waste your time.",1448323200,,391,4.157894736842105

2137170,3,B0002XMZT4,"I wasted my money on this one!  I laughed from the begining and I am trying to keep watching until the end. I give this movie a 3 stars because of the fighting. The acting is terrible. The three chicks reminds me of ""Charlie Angels"" The Black version this one was ahead of it time!  Could have been a good movie if the actors were better. Story line ok. Usually, when the head of an organization King he found out his main man Calvin was behind the killings. He let him go! Oh no! He should have killed him! Well that would be the end.  So the story goes there are others behind the scenes..If you are bored and it raining outside and nothing is on TV. Then try this one. You will laugh I guarantee..",1415232000,2,700,4.132352941176471

2137174,3,B0002XMZT4,"Mega-gangster, King Lathrop (Owen Watson) is being hit, and hit hard. Somebody's moving in on his turf, and roughing up his customers. King's got to get to the bottom of this, and fast! So, he calls in Velvet Smooth (Johnnie Hill) to make things happen. Ms. Smooth calls her crew together, including Frankie (Rene Van Clief), and the grand showdown / throw-down begins! See a dozen masked thugs karate kicked to near extinction! Watch as their manhood is put into dire condition! Velvet Smooth and Frankie are gonna take out the trash! VELVET SMOOTH is another urban crime thriller from 1976. While nowhere close to the bottom-of-the-cesspool horrendousness of THE GUY FROM HARLEM, it's no COFFY or CLEOPATRA JONES either! Even so, it does have that funky, 70s charm going on. Yes, Johnnie Hill acts as though she's still rehearsing her lines, but hey, she's awesome! Looking good in red! Especially kicking major felonious buttocks! Sure, the fight choreography is just south of TNT JACKSON, but hey, Velvet is Smoooooth! Even when the microphone is in plain view, enough so, that it could be a character in itself! Right on...  P.S.- Check out that theme song! ""Outta sight"" doesn't even begin to describe it!...",1411257600,3,1214,4.950980392156863

2137179,4,B0002XMZT4,"If you like 70's blaxploitation movies, you will like ""Velvet Smooth"". The title character and her cohorts are martial arts experts who run a detective agency, sort of like a black ""Charlie's Angels"".  Considering the movie was made in the 70's, the special effects and choreography in the scenes are acceptable for that era. The plot was typical for Blaxploitation movies but with a slight twist.

8034262,2,B0002XMZT4,"Sounds exciting, right?  And yet, this one lays a jive turkey egg.  From the acting to the soundtrack, from the cinematography to the fight choreography, this looks all the world like a MadTV skit.  But if you like 70s movies that are so good they're bad, this is one of the worst.  It fairly reeks of Hai Karate and nagahyde.",1497916800,,326,4.383333333333334
8034263,3,B0002XMZT4,This movie took me back to the days of watching cheap late night karate flicks on TV. It was definitely low budget. However I found it very entertaining. It sucks you in until the end. Get some friends and have a few laughs.,1485648000,,224,4.232558139534884

8034265,4,B0002XMZT4,"From the horrible acting to the lame fight sequences to the appearance of the movie microphone as a character in one scene, this movie is awful.

8034268,2,B0002XMZT4,"VELVET SMOOTH is a blacksploitation film that completely misses the exploitation part. Johnnie Hill plays the title character, a female private eye who runs an all-female agency, with two female operatives, one African-American and the other Hispanic, both of them much better-looking than the title character, a tall, thin woman with all the sex appeal of a bean pole. This 1976 vehicle cries out for a Pam Grier or a Tamara Dobson in the lead role: someone who can believably turn heads when she walks into a room. While the martial arts choreography is very well done, it gets repetitive after a while. The plot depends on sudden revelations for which, with one exception, there is no foreshadowing. The acting is sub-par, on the level of a bad community theater production. The camera work is typical 1970's hand-held stuff, that may make you queasy at times. It's free for Amazon Prime members, and worth every cent of it. In short, VELVET SMOOTH is a stupid, crudely made, poorly written and unsexy waste of time.",1471392000,4,1019,4.862068965517241
8034269,5,B0002XMZT4,"The jumpsuits! The fight scenes! The really, hard acting! The clickety-clack of platform shoes on concrete! The not-so-subtle shoutout to Kentucky Fried Chicken!
