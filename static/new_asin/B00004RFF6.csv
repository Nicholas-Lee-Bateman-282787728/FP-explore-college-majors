1342699,5,B00004RFF6,I am waiting for the DVD to come out. This is one of the best westerns that have been made. VHS tape does not do it justice. Come on MGM release this on DVD.,1171152000,,157,3.6470588235294117
1342700,5,B00004RFF6,"Back in May of this year I recieved an email from Amazon asking me to take part in a poll they were running for I think it was Warner Bros. Video who were considering a number of films to be released on DVD.I do not remember the films to choose from but I do know that Cimmeron was one of the selection and of course I voted for it. I have no idea what the out come of the poll was. I can only hope that the powers that be will give this great film the DVD restoration and presentation it should have.

I remember seeing this movie it at a first run theater on a giant screen with great sound. I remember that the Land Rush sceen was heart stopping. Some hate this film for its chopped up story line while others see it as a great Hollywood Western.

Lets cross our fingers and hope that a restored DVD will be out soon.",1155513600,5,820,3.9939024390243905

1342702,1,B00004RFF6,"this is the worst western I ever saw, not because of the story, but because of the so called ""stars"". I cannot believe Glenn Ford the role of the Oklahoma Wigwam editor, he's not a writer with the gun in his hand and he doesn't speak like a writer.

Maria Schell is the worst actress in any western. She is a ""Heimchen am Herd"" in a German Heimatfilm, but not a brave woman. She is unbelievable whiny, always unmotivated grinning.

This is definately not a chick movie - the thought processes and emotions  that Ford's character explores are no more understood by actual women than  they are by his character's wife.

The land grab scene was one of the most amazing scenes in the movie; quite a feat without the use of CGI and for me, it really captured what it must have been like for these pioneers. The range of emotions from excitement, to frustration and Greed to Grief. No watered down story but harsh reality. It also showed not much has changed in America with regards to Greed and sacrifice.

1342750,1,B00004RFF6,"One of the poorest acted, directed, and set westerns of all time.  They begin the land rush in a region that LOOKS NOTHING LIKE the geography of Oklahoma....instead of the flat grasslands, they shot the scene in an area surrounded by steep mountains!  Absurd.  Also, much of the dialogue is cartoonish and simplistic, maudlin.  The Oklahoma Land Rush is indeed a great subject for a film, but this ain't it.  If any movie BEGS to be re-done, this is one.  Not worth anyone's money.  And, it doesn't do any justice to the book, either.

One scene is enough to make my point.  The cartoonish drunk and the stereotype ""doomed drunk"" have a shooting contest at two bottles which the ""evil"" cartoonish drunk forces a man to hold.  The movie is SO dumb they have Ford's pregnant wife as apparently so stupid she stands behind the guy holding the bottles!!!  In other words, she's too dumb to know to get out of the way.

1342752,4,B00004RFF6,"This is a remake (29 years later) of the original Richard Dix film version of Edna Ferber's novel, with Glenn Ford in Dix's role as roguish Yancy ""Cimarron"" Cravat, former cowhand and gambler, who upon marrying Sabra (Maria Schell), daughter of a wealthy Missouri family, in 1889, resolves to take part in the imminent land rush in the Oklahoma Territory.  With two wagons full of supplies and furniture, the couple sets out for the starting line, falling in by the way with Tom and Sarah Wyatt (Arthur O'Connell, Mercedes McCambridge) and their brood of children, who, like many others, see the rush as their last chance to gain a good homestead, and with Sam and Mavis Pegler (Robert Keith, Aline MacMahon), who plan to start a newspaper.  When Sam is killed, Yancy takes over the paper, helped by pressman Jesse Rickey (Harry Morgan), and becomes an outspoken force for everyone's rights, including Indians and young William Hardy (Russ Tamblyn), the son of a cattleman for whom he once rode.  Yet over 25 years he spends at least as much time away from Sabra as with her, joining the gold rush to the Yukon, fighting with Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan Hill, and even enlisting, in his 50's, in World War I.  Meanwhile Sabra must find the strength and drive to raise their son and keep the paper going, while the Wyatts, thanks to oil, prosper and become influential, and Hardy, as the Cimarron Kid, takes to outlawry.  Nor is she entirely sure that she's first in Yancy's heart, as a former flame of his, Dixie Lee (Anne Baxter), is very much on the scene, beating Yancy to the parcel of land he most wanted.  Full of complex interrelationships, Oklahoma history, and a thrilling re-creation of the rush itself, with Ford well suited to his part, this is a good family movie that should interest anyone who likes Western Americana.",1448841600,,1833,4.730407523510972

1342810,4,B00004RFF6,"CIMARRON is a film that all classic cinema fans should see at least once. The opening sequence of the 1889 Oklahoma Territory Land Rush is still quite remarkable, and the early struggles of the townspeople of Osage well-rendered. This feels and looks much like a silent movie, but has the benefit of sound. You can clearly see why CIMARRON won the Best Picture Oscar, even at a distance of 75 years.

Much criticism has been given Richard Dix for his larger-than-life portrayal of this story's ostensible hero, Yancy Cravat. Leonard Maltin for one called Dix's acting ""overripe."" I couldn't disagree more. Dix's traveling stageshow technique is most appropriate for the times depicted. That being said, I came away disliking Yancey because he was a selfish individual who put his own wants above the needs of his family.

The story unfolds episodically in the years 1889, 1890, 1893, 1898, 1907, 1929 and 1930. Early on, Cravat fares best with viewers. He helps establish the town of Osage, saves lives with his gunslinging and kills several bad guys. But then the wanderlust takes hold and Yancey leaves behind his small family and wife Sabra, who must run the fledgling newspaper Yancey founded all alone.

The gadabout reappears five years later, and hangs around long enough to defend in court the town floozy against all the ""decent womenfolk,"" including his own humiliated wife. Then Cravat is gone again, this time for a decade! But for some mysterious reason, his wife stays loyal, passively awaiting his return.

In 1907, the now middle-aged wanderer is back-- no explanations given. Yancey soon after clashes with Sabra over the content of an editorial, then haughtily proclaims that HE is the editor of the newspaper he hasn't been a part of for 13 years, and the editorial would read as he wants it to! Sabra gives in quietly.

Do you think this guy would stay home now that he was older? Uh-uh. THIS time, Cravat vanishes without a trace for 23 years, and still Sabra waits for him. At movie's end, the elderly Cravat performs one last heroic act and his wife finds him just as he's ready to expire. The man's good qualities hardly compensate for the bad. Had I been Sabra, the first time Yancey abandoned me would have been the last. Were women that different 100 years ago? Was there no sense of self-esteem?

The true hero of CIMARRON is Sabra Cravat, who raised two children, successfully ran and grew a newspaper and ended up in Congress only a decade after women were given the right to vote. Edna Ferber's skillful storytelling assures you could never doubt the depth of this woman's courage and dedication for even a moment.",1374710400,,2645,4.814977973568282

1342846,2,B00004RFF6,"""Cimarron"" is a 1960 color western from Anthony Mann starring Glenn Ford and Maria Schell. The film chronicles 40 critical years in the formation of Oklahoma, from the early land rush days in 1889 through statehood. It was based on the 1929 Edna Ferber (1885-1968) novel. Ferber was the Pulitzer Prize winning writer whose other works include ""Show Boat"" (1926), ""American Beauty"" (1931), ""Dinner at Eight"" (1932), and ""Giant"" (1952).

The main character, played by Glenn Ford, is based partly on Sam Houston's youngest son, Temple (1860-1905). Houston was a lawyer known for his unorthodox behavior and flamboyant dress, and he was also a deadly fighter with a gun. Some of the scenes in the novel and the film were taken directly from Houston's life.

Quiet and handsome Glenn Ford (1916-2006) appeared in more than 100 films from 1937 to 1991. He was nominated for a Golden Globe 3 times and won once (""Pocketful of Miracles"" in 1961). Ford could do light comedy (e.g., ""Teahouse of the August Moon"", ""Courtship of Eddie's Father"", ""Don't Go Near the Water"") as well as drama (e.g., ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""3:10 to Yuma""). He enjoyed playing the everyman and said that ""it gives the audience someone real to identify with. I never play anyone but myself on screen.""

One of the key problems with this film is that the main character, Yancy, is a charismatic albeit contradictory man, and is so far from the ""everyman"" that Ford played that the true nature is lost on screen. In the 1931 version, Richard Dix captured the spirit of Yancy much better, making the original version a much better film.

Austrian born Maria Schell (1926-2005) plays Yancy's wife. Schell was much more popular overseas (twice nominated for a BAFTA  - ""Gervaise"", ""The Heart of the Matter"") and never achieved much popularity in US films.

Anne Baxter (1923-85) plays Dixie Lee, a saloon worker with the proverbial golden heart. By 1960 Baxter was a big star having won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for ""The Razor's Edge"" (1946) and appearing in such films as ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), ""North Star"" (1943), ""All About Eve"" (1950) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956).

Harry Morgan (1915-2011) plays Jesse Rickey, a friend of Ford. Morgan who is best known for his years as Sgt. Bill Gannon on ""Dragnet"" (1967-70) and his Emmy winning role as Col. Sherman T. Potter on ""M*A*S*H"" (1975-83), although I think his best role was in ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943).

Other notable members of the cast include Mercedes McCambridge, Vic Morrow, Russ Tamblyn, Arthur O'Connell, Edgar Buchanan, and David Opatpshu. Though they were all talented actors, none of them are at the top of their game in this one.

Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). Among his other notable films are ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), ""Fury"" (1936), and Captains Courageous"" (1937).

Anthony Mann (1906-67) was nominated 3 times by the DGA (""El Cid"", ""Men in War"", ""The Glenn Miller Story""). He directed 44 films between 1939 and 1968 and is best remembered for his work in film noir and in westerns. In addition to the 5 he did with Jimmy Stewart, Mann directed  ""Man of the West"" (1958) with Gary Cooper, ""The Tin Star"" (1957) with Henry Fonda, and ""The Last Frontier"" (1955) with Victor Mature. Many of Mann's film have a strong tendency toward sadism, and his westerns often show a blend of film noir, although none of that is apparent in this film. In fact this was his last western and he was fired during the filming.

FWIW - it's pretty easy to tell the scenes directed by Mann and the pick up scenes done in the studio by Charles Walters

Cinematographer Robert Surtees (1906-85) won 3 Oscars (""King Solomon's Mines"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""Ben Hur"") and was nominated 16 times. He began work as an assistant to Gregg Toland, and eventually surpassed his mentor, although no one ever did another ""Citizen Kane"".

In 1960, the top money earners were ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Psycho"", ""Spartacus"", ""Exodus"", and ""The Alamo"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Apartment"" (Picture, Director) and ""Elmer Gantry"" (Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable releases that year were ""La Dolce Vita"", ""Inherit the Wind"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Oceans 11"", ""Two Women"", and ""The Virgin Spring"".

Westerns were at their peak in popularity in 1960. Some examples - John Wayne's ""The Alamo"", Randolph Scott in ""Comanche Station"", Woody Strode in ""Sergeant Rutledge"",  and Burt Lancaster in ""The Unforgiven"".

The NY Times said the land rush scenes were ""vividly and excitingly reproduced"" but then lamented that the film ""droned along for a couple of hours"" and ""there is no sense of it being anything but another -- and rather labored -- frontier pastiche from Hollywood.""

Bottom line - a western so ordinary and devoid of any special characteristics that it's best to avoid. People interested in the book or Oklahoma could do worse than viewing the 1931 version.",1329523200,10,5147,4.923787528868361
1342847,5,B00004RFF6,"This is an epic western. That makes it a little long, but it is worth watching. You might think that this movie will just bore you because it is so long. The main character is involved in many stories and trips which you get to see, but at some point they seem to run together with little point. However, it will all make sense at the end. In the meantime, Glenn Ford is at his best as a cowboy. The action is all very good and the language is as well. What you also learn from this one is that some men are just made to wander regardless of what is in their lives. All in all, in spite of the length, it is a great movie.",1269475200,4,622,3.905511811023622

1342849,3,B00004RFF6,"The last and least of Anthony Mann's Westerns, 1960's Cimarron was originally intended by MGM as a Rock Hudson vehicle after the success of Giant. It's at once a lavish film and an undernourished one, not least because of the production problems that saw Mann's run of bad luck with epics repeat itself: after being fired from Spartacus at the start of shooting by Stanley Kubrick, on Cimarron he was replaced towards the end of shooting by an uncredited Charles Walters. It's all to easy to spot the join, with the many early exterior scenes that are very obviously and artificially shot on interior sets at the studio sticking out like a sore thumb with Mann's signature location filming.

Though remembered today, if at all, as doorstop soap operas, in their day Edna Ferner's novels were hugely controversial, and Cimarron was no exception, dealing along the way with racism, anti-Semitism and Indian land rights, though these are treated rather less boldly here than in the 1930 version (especially in the general release and European versions that trimmed a subplot with the leads' son marrying a Native American girl, though these scenes are in the Region 1 DVD). What's left is an ambitious saga, charting the changing face of the wilderness from the Oklahoma Land Rush to the 'civilisation' that comes with the discovery of oil and the big money to be made by a few, taking in the winners and losers strewn along the path of progress along the way, all nominally held together by the restless figure of Yancey Cravat (Glenn Ford). A man who tries everything but can never stay the course before chasing the next dream, he's held as the pioneer ideal, but it's clear that his long-suffering wife (Maria Schell) is the saga's real hero, setting roots and building a future. Structurally it's one of those books better suited to a mini-series than a film, while the rootless nature of its hero - who vanishes from the last third of the film almost entirely - leaves it feeling very unsatisfying. It doesn't help that the film's most spectacular scene, the truly epic land rush sequence, happens so early in the film that everything that follows seems an anticlimax.

Unfortunately the casting doesn't help. While Ford isn't as insufferably hammy as Richard Dix in the original, he never lives up to the great claims made for his character, and he's not helped by a bad haircut that makes him look like Oliver Hardy after a diet (it's no surprise that this film and The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse pretty much ended his career as a top box-office attraction). And for all her efforts, Schell isn't able to exert the kind of charisma or star power that the problematic last third desperately needs. The supporting performances are highly variable too. David Opatashu, Arthur O'Connell, and Charles McGraw offer dependable turns but Russ Tamblyn is shockingly bad.

But ultimately the problem is that the film never seems to quite decide what it wants to be or what parts of the story it wants to tell. It just sprawls out in all directions, never building up much sense of drive or purpose, and even Mann's visual imagination deserts him for much of the film. Instead it's a film with a handful of memorable moments - the land rush sequence, played more for chaos and carnage than exhilaration, one terrific shooting after a lynching and an excellent scene with Aline MacMahon at a makeshift grave - stranded in a rather forgettable film.

Boasting a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, the only extra on the Region 1 disc is the original theatrical trailer.",1241654400,9,3563,4.826513911620294

1342851,5,B00004RFF6,"MGM presents ""CIMARRON"" (December 1960) (147 mins/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) -- Our story line and plot, The epic saga of a frontier family, Cimarron starts with the Oklahoma Land Rush on 22 April 1889. The Cravet family builds their newspaper Oklahoma Wigwam into a business empire and Yancey Cravet is the adventurer-idealist who, to his wife's anger, spurns the opportunity to become governor since this means helping to defraud the indians of their land and oil --- Anthony Mann (Director), Robert Surtees (Cinematographer) and John D. Dunning (Film Editor), with the striking memorable score from Franz Waxman completely stirring the veins of drama, which will keep the heart pounding from the opening scenes to the end credits --- One character is expanded considerably from the 1931 film. Edna May Oliver was Mrs. Wyatt who was a pioneer woman whose husband we never did meet --- Here Mrs. Wyatt is played by Mercedes McCambridge who is married to Arthur O'Connell who is very important to the story. They're this hardscrabble share cropper family who get a real scrubby piece of land at the beginning of the land rush, mainly because O'Connell falls off the stagecoach right at the beginning of the land rush and Mercedes runs across the starting line and she claims the land right at the line --- Anthony Mann went from making westerns to epics, and with this film, he was in the best of both worlds --- Director Anthony Mann who got fired towards the end of the film's production did a very good job with both the cast and the spectacle. The Oklahoma land rush scene was as thrillingly done as it was in the 1931 version --- All the characters present in Edna Ferber's saga of the transforming of Oklahoma from territory to state made it from the first film --- The cast includes also such fine people as Anne Baxter, Edgar Buchanan, Russ Tamblyn, Vic Morrow, Aline McMahon, Robert Keith, Charles McGraw, all ably filling out parts from the original version. The land rush scene is every bit as good as the first time around --- All of them meet during the Oklahoma land rush and while Glenn and Maria are the leads, the story of the film is what happens to all of them.

I think it's one of Anthony Mann's greatest films, much more sweeping and visually creative than the original, and I've always been moved by Maria Schriver's performance, and of course Glenn Ford who is always great. I think it is a particularly deep western- complex and interesting even when it fails at times... I think its epic ambition make it particularly enriching and fascinating to watch. Really beautiful at times...",1220918400,,601,4.844660194174757
1342853,3,B00004RFF6,"Maybe I was spoiled by the 1931 version of this film. In particular the very hammy portrayal of Yancey by Richard Dix has come to grow on me just as Irene Dunne's wonderful portrayal of Sabra. That film won an unbelievable Best Picture Oscar and even a Best Actor nomination for Dix. This movie is far superior to the original, especially with Glenn Ford as Yancey playing it straight this time. It confronts head-on the social issues that the original just skirts around, yet in doing this it just seems to take on too much. The film is about an ill-matched couple that settles in Oklahoma during the land rush years and how things progress between the two of them as the years roll on. Yancey is a wanderer at heart, and can't help taking off every time a new frontier beckons. His wife, Sabra, wants Yancey to settle down and raise a family. As a result of Yancey's adventurous ways it is left to Sabra to bear the burden of taking care of the business and the children. You'll probably like this one more if you haven't seen the original.

1342854,4,B00004RFF6,"I don't remember when this movie reached the general public but I do remember that I was quite young at the time. I was in the Army and it was soon after I left high school(it only cost a quarter to see a movie then).  I was impressed to see a story of a man who was so independent.  He was so independentthat it worked against his family.  However, the story depicted the the raw individualism of the typical westerner of our great country.  Life and times were difficult in those days and westerners refected their moral beliefs in their daily lives.  Yes, it did strain their family life but to this day it shows the strength of the western conservatism.

Things re changing but you can still see the ruggedness of the families who were born and raised here and are generations old.

I will get this movie and view it several more times before I die.

1342855,5,B00004RFF6,"Martin Scorcese has called Anthony Mann Hollywood's most underrated director.  He's right of course.  Mann is a God.  It's a shame some of his Westerns have never been released on DVD or that some of his widescreen Westerns such as The Far Country and Bend in the River have only been relesed on pan and scan full frame vidoes and DVDs.  At least Cimarron is avaliable on video in widescreen.  Perhaps you need to have seen a number of Mann's films in order to appreciate Cimarron, Mann's last Western, and how moving it is at certain points.  There's an amazing shot of Glenn Ford leaning against a post in his home as he waits for his wife to see that he has finally returned home after being gone for five years.  Glenn Ford plays a typical Mannian hero who is on the side of the law but not a lawman hismelf and who is unable to settle down in a home with a family.  The only other Western Mann made with a happy ending is The Tin Star.  There Henry Fonda (the hero) rides off with his wife after putting on a sheriff star to help out the local sheriff.  But even this happy ending falls short. Fonda takes no action, and the young lawman (Anthony Perkins) does the job just fine all by himself.  Cimarron is kind of a sequel to The Tin Star.  It begins with Ford playing a family man going out West with his new wife.  But things quickly get rough.  The Oklahoma stampede looks like the chariot race in Wiliam Wyler's Ben-Hur.  Ford upholds morality and civil rights, but not as a lawman.  After killing the bad guy, he becomes a crusading, liberal newspaper man.  He's Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne in Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence rolled into one.  But unlike Stewart, who goes on to be a politician, he turns down a job as governor. (Ford won't accept the reward money for killing outlaws either.)  His long suffering wife finally leaves him, and he never reappears as a character in the film except in a voice-over.  What is most haunting about the film is Ford's disappearance form it for long stretches.  He basically abandons his family, fighting first as  a rough rider in the Spanish-American War and then again in WWI.  Mann goes into the melodramatic territory of Douglas Sirk, with Mann as a failed authority figure and patriarch.  He fails to save the son of an old friend from becoming an outlaw.  Ford loves his one child, a son, very deeply, but he nevertheless is not exactly an ideal father given his absences.  Anthony Mann was an orphan who went to the school of hard knocks in New York.  It's hard not to see Cimarron as his own love letter to the father who abandoned him as a child.  In any case, Cimarron is a haunting film, well worth seeing, just like Mann's other films.",1185494400,8,2711,4.4222222222222225
