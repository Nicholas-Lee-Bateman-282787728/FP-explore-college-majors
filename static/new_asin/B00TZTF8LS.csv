8703611,3,B00TZTF8LS,"Really only worth it for seeing some Fall footage of ""The Joke"" done live from 2002 and a few other songs. I wanted to like this a lot despte all the negative things I'd read. Worst of all was the bonus footage of ""sentences"" of a different MES chat that doesn't seem complete, like a dvd that is skipping while someone is talking.
Glad I supported the release anyway",1462406400,,367,4.333333333333333
8703612,4,B00TZTF8LS,"it was OK, but not as good as it could've been.  the filmmakers seem to be a fan of one of the styles of music that the Fall do, and made a documentary about that",1434931200,,162,3.6285714285714286
