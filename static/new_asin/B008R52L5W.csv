8529892,2,B008R52L5W,"Except for the fair '70s TV film, THE HOUSE THAT WOULD NOT DIE (thus the 2 stars here), these are very bad movies that are no better and some worse than the average ""reality"" paranormal TV shows.  I couldn't get through them all as they went from bad to worse. I was unable to stand one more of those ghost experts exclaiming how they were ""feeling something here"" with fake fear and all that endless red filtered footage and clichd sound effects.
If I ever decide to watch the last few and if I find something of merit, I will revise this.
Instead of this, find INSIDIOUS, THE CONJURING or THE ORPHANAGE for good modern ghost stories.
Or get the Mt. Everest of haunted house films, Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING.
This is strictly for the rubes who buy into this nonsense.",1409529600,,769,4.453900709219858
8529893,3,B008R52L5W,"There are no superior films in this collection but plenty of decent movies in the range 2 and 4 stars. For the price, you will have something to watch in those time periods when you are not prepared to come to grips with a major film. I would have given perhaps one four, two or three two's, and the rest three's.",1374710400,3,313,4.147540983606557
8529894,5,B008R52L5W,Love these old scary films..all so hard to find..and all on this one dvd. We had a great time watching them.,1362873600,,108,4.190476190476191
8529895,4,B008R52L5W,"The 8-Film Haunted Hollows from Echo Bridge Entertainment presents the following films for your viewing pleasure: Darkness, Children of the Corn 666:Isaac's Return, Evidence of a Haunting, 7 Nights of Darkness, Haunting of Winchester House, The Haunting of Fox Hollow Farm, The House That Would Not Die, and Ominous.

While the quality of the films vary from A-list films(like Darkness & Children of the Corn 666:Isaac's Return) to B-movie favorites(like Haunting of Winchester House, Evidence of a Haunting, Ominous, and The House That Would Not Die)...all are about encounters with haunted grounds, their spiritual inhabitants & the like. I'll be quite honest here..while alot of these films in this collection are low-budget affairs, every last movie provides thrills perfect for viewing. There were one or two there that I actually enjoyed more than Paranormal Activity and you know how popular that series is. What gets me is that these are movies I've never heard of before yet they are pretty awesome movies in their own right. I'm thankful that Echo Bridge Entertainment includes them in collections such as these so we can get to see them.

Lol, I know Halloween has passed us at this point but this collection would be perfect to watch around Halloween. Do I recommend it? Of course, I do. I love these collections that Echo Bridge Entertainment puts out and I hope they continue. I really liked this one.",1352678400,5,1415,5.042735042735043
