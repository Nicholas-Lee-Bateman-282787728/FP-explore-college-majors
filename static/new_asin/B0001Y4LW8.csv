He came from a youth tempered with hard work; discipline; before he was 20 years old he was engaged in fighting 2 wars: one in Europe the 100th with the 442nd and against ignorant racists in the United States he fought to protect. He had to adjust to life without a right arm lost during the last months of the war. He was a lawyer who became Senator (the first Asian) in Washington, D.C and you must watch this documentary to follow him through the years ... spectacular challenges.
He passed away while still as Senator planning his next campaign on December 17, 2012. He was a Democrat but his ultimate concern was how the decisions of Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike will benefit the American people.
Our young people today need heroes; such as our pre-teengage boys. Senator Daniel Inouye is a model of courage; how to overcome obstacles; mental discipline; and true power is found not in taking from but in serving your country: as a soldier and Senator. Please consider showing this DVD to Boy scouts and part of a history in the classroom.",1381017600,,1173,4.726829268292683

8018231,4,B0001Y4LW8,"With the recent deaths of Patsy Mink and Robert Matsui, Daniel Inouye is one of the few senior Asian-American federal politicians left.  In this documentary, you found out about his life and accomplishments.  This work would be an excellent viewing piece for Asian-American boys in need of role models or Asian-Americans interested in entering politics.  Perhaps people could view it alongside George Takei's autobiography.

There is a racist myth which says that all Asians are foreigners.  However, here, one sees Inouye's active involvement in World War II, the Iran-Contra hearings, the statehood of Hawaii, and other seminal historical events.  The work illustrates his status as an underappreciated American leader of color.  Though the work mentions that he has critics, it's mostly an almost entirely praising piece.

Senator Inouye is an octogenarian and must be honored for his lengthy tenure in politics.  However, his old man's voice may annoy or bore some viewers.  On the other hand, his status as wise and sweet old man may delight others.

Politicians such as Bob Dole are in this film.  Thus, the cast is bipartisan and multiracial.  However, I wish some Black or Latino Congresspersons would have been interviewed in this work.  Inouye received blood transfusions as a soldier from African-American donors.  Inouye has also been a big supporter of indigenous people's rights.  So because he is a strong promoter of person-of-color unity, it would have been nice to see a non-white peer concur with that fact.

The narrator for this documentary is an unknown person with a dry voice.  I wish they had used an Asian-American male actor for the job.  I think Pat Morita, B.D. Wong, or Russell Wong would have been excellent narrators.  Harvey Fierstein did an outstanding job narrating the documentary on Harvey Milk,  Why couldn't Senator Inouye open the door for another Asian-American male in this piece?

Though people of color make up one quarter of the American population, there are only five people of color in the Senate (one-twentieth of the members).  They are Inouye, Akaka, Salazar, Martinez (a Republican, :( ), and my well-praised Senator Barack Obama.  There are no women of color in this arena since Carole Mosely Braun left office in the mid-1990s.  Daniel Inouye is a pioneer and I found this documentary to be an inspiring gem.",1112140800,2,2362,5.10443864229765
