Every single song is fun and meaningful and will have you and your kids singing all day. Our favorite is the challah song, or actually the supermarket song, or.....maybe they all are!! The story line is great and the characters are fun! What a great way for kids to get excited about Shabbos! Cant wait for more videos by Rebbetzin Tap!

8455260,5,B0053IBGS4,"Kids love watching Rebbetzin Tap and their friends as they prepare for Shabbat in Jerusalem, along the way, they meet up with a teenage girl and her family and visit an old age home. The singing and dancing is really cute.",1349740800,,222,4.439024390243903
8455261,5,B0053IBGS4,"I must admit my expectations for this video were low. Well, boy was I wrong!
We join Rebbetzin Tap as she (tap) dances and sings through her erev shabbos preparations.
Rebbetzin Tap joins her 2 friends in the supermarket and they sing and tap dance through the store until they have everything they need.
Tamar Rudy teaches us her special challah recipe. She even has a magic ladle to help her dough rise! After the challah baking lesson, we have the fun challah song, my favorite song on the DVD.
Rebbetzin Tap goes to a senior center with 3 girls from her neighborhood. They deliver the challahs they baked and visit the residents. Respect and love to elders is shown here.
Rebbetzin Tap and her friends come home (after some car trouble that was magically fixed with a wrench) singing and cleaning Rebbetzin Tap's house for Shabbos.
This DVD is very entertaining, it had me laughing aloud at a few points.
The songs were very well done and I really enjoyed every single one.
I showed the video to my 2 year old nephew and he loved it! He started screaming at the computer every time the screen froze.
My only complaint is that it was a bit short.
I also wanted to point out that the bonus features (tap dance class, song video and challah braiding are not included in the rental version.
But great news...the sequel to this DVD is now out- Rebbetzin Tap and the Jewish Holidays and it is longer. I can't wait to watch it!",1314576000,,1424,4.480769230769231
8455262,5,B0053IBGS4,"When I first watched this DVD, my expectations were frankly low - a cast of women and girls from a neighborhood in Israel filmed themselves singing around town and made it into a video. Ho hum.

But I was so, so very surprised and utterly delighted.

This is PROFESSIONAL. The filming, the scripting, everything. Total pleasure to watch.

This is ENTERTAINING. I sit and watch together with my girls. They are 2.5 and 5 - they adore it, and wish I would let them watch it several times a day. The songs are really enjoyable and catchy, pretty and full of great content. Even the original tunes are great (the Challah song and 'Shabbos Is Almost Here' we sing around the house together all the time). Unlike a lot of children's programming, these songs are polished musically and lyrically, and don't cause me to squirm or want to fast forward like some songs sung by a purple dinosaur might (for example). :)

This is EDUCATIONAL. In the style of Sesame Street, multi-culturalism is subtly taught and appreciated. The cast includes children to seniors, and multiple stripes of Jewish observance. The stars are children and adults both. And the messages - chessed (lovingkindness), diligence, enjoying chores, trusting in God, honoring elders - are all wonderfully presented, and indeed my children absorbed them and even emulate them.

This is FUN. The songs are infectious as I said, the little bonuses on the DVD like a tap dancing lesson and challah braiding are great extras, and there's a lot of humor in the film as well.

This is NICE. Let me explain what I mean. :) Sometimes (even in religious programming) a villain is used to make a point or provide drama. There's no bad guys in this DVD though, something I appreciate immensely since one of my daughters frightens very easily. Additionally, it's NICE because no one is ever insulted or even teased just to get a laugh. And it still manages to be quite funny at times.

I know I'm gushing, but I really do love this DVD, and I'm so grateful that Rebbetzin Tap and her husband made such a quality product that children and their mothers can enjoy. A sequel is coming out soon, and I can't wait to see it too. I recommend this DVD for any Jewish family.

Bravo Rebbetzin Tap!",1311724800,4,2235,4.654822335025381
