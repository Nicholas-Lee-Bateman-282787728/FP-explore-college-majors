6357899,5,B00JHH20PA,"I very much enjoy old movies, especially old westerns and I have all of the Gene Autry movie collections released as of today. This collection includes Tumbling Tumbleweeds (1935) one of his first movies, The Old Corral (1936) that introduces Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers to the big screen for the first time, Prairie Moon (1938) and Carolina Moon (1940). All of these in this collection also star Smiley Brunette (he could play over 100 instruments) as the deputy and sidekick for Gene. Wonderful movies!",1426636800,,516,4.875

6357903,5,B00JHH20PA,"Growing up as a child it was Roy Rogers, Gene Autry Hopalong Cassidy and of course John wayne and many more.  I always put Roy over Gene as my favorite.  I'm in my 60's an I have changed my mind Gene Autry was the best western star.  Gene's movies were more believable to me.  I love the ones made in the 30's and 40's.  So this collection I really wanted, especially Carolina Moon.  Thanks",1418428800,4,390,4.202702702702703

As a longtime B-Western fan, I would recommend this line of Gene Autry discs to all of Gene's fans and to all B-Western aficionados in general. Keep up the good work, Timeless and how about bringing out some DVDs of the other great B-Western stars of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, please.",1417046400,2,383,4.4714285714285715

8650835,4,B00JHH20PA,"This set is generally good but not as good as #6.  The picture and sound quality are excellent in all of these collections.  The movies are variable.  Everyone sees different things in a movie. Being a lot older now than when I first saw Gene Autry movies at the theater, I look at them with a more jaundiced eye.  Author Jon Tuska calls it ""the Autry Fantasy"", and that is a good term.  They are no more realistic than today's superhero movies, but then it is the entertainment value that people are looking for.  Sort of like the excitement of Tom Mix films when he first came on the scene as compared to the somber and more realistic films of William S. Hart.

""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" is Gene's first singing cowboy picture.  It is hokey but entertaining.

""The Old Corral"" is very dated.  The guy who plays Simms is downright creepy.  The so-called comedy duo of Oscar and Elmer are so awful it is a good example of why some people look down on western movies and country music.  Truly awful stuff that should never have been in this movie.  On the other side of the coin, this movie features Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers.  This is the one where Gene and Roy have a fight out at the old shack in the hills.  In the interview segment for this movie, Roy and Dale join Gene.  They have a good natured conversation recalling the old days.  Roy mentions getting a chipped tooth from the fight with Gene.  They also tell about their western shirts with Roy describing Tom Mix's cowboy clothes.

""Prairie Moon"" is, for me, spoiled by the surly, obnoxious punks who bring all the worst of the Dead End Kids stereotype to their roles.  So corny and irritating that it ruins the movie.  After watching their obnoxious behavior through most of the movie, we are supposed to believe that, at the last minute, one of them sees the light and begins to make amends.  Just like that, the other two turn on the charm and we are now delighted that Gene Autry was such a good influence on them.  Gene sings Jimmie Rodgers' hit song ""I'm in the Jailhouse Now"".  Later, in the interview segment, Gene tells about Jimmie Rodgers being a good friend of his.  He also tells about making this movie at the Iverson's Ranch location at Chatsworth.

""Carolina Moon"" is the best of these four movies.  There are a good many songs including two by an excellent choir of black people sitting around the bonfire in the evening.  As a matter of fact, there are more black people appearing in this movie than I've ever seen in a B-western.  Stereotypes, of course.  The lady in the ""mammy"" role who looks like a double for Academy Award winner Hattie McDaniel is Hattie's sister, Etta.  You've just got to see Smiley Burnette in drag, in blackface makeup, and dressed up as a mammy!  The interview segment has the great director, George Sherman discussing his career with Autry and Pat Buttram.  You wish it could have been a longer interview.  The cast includes Jimmie Lewis and his Texas Cowboys. But they appear only once in the opening scene as backup for a song by Gene.  Lewis was later better known as Texas Jim Lewis and he had a western swing band.  One curious note is in the Trivia section for the movie there is a long description of Lewis and his musical instrument called a Hootenanny.  The thing is, he did not play the hootenanny in this movie.  Later, in the 1950s, Lewis was host of a kiddie program on Seattle television where he showed B-westerns, told stories, and played the hootenanny.

Someone in Production decided that the Melody Ranch Theater segments need to be messed up by including all of the little two or three-second bits of film or sound that occurred in the original broadcasts of these programs during station breaks on the Nashville Network. It makes for an annoying interference in continuity to the conversations between Autry, Buttram, and guests. This was not an issue in the earlier Gene Autry Collections.",1458604800,,3930,4.5759312320916905
8650836,5,B00JHH20PA,"I thought these a little pricey in their previous format, but four movies on two discs is a decent price. I just viewed ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" with Gene, Smiley Burnett, and a younger Gabby Hayes, sans beard and with teeth! These restorations are first class and the movies look better than they did in the early 50's when I first saw them on TV.",1451779200,,346,4.507936507936508
