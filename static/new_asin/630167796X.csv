346496,5,630167796X,"The Sequel to the Emmy Award Winning movie Bill is so great words cannot even describe.  Thankfully I found a very nice gentleman who made me copies of both of these films.  What can I say, Mickey Rooney is the best.  He is my all time favorite actor.  These two movies showcase his almighy talent.  He played Bill to perfection.  I'm totally amazed how he could take a mentally handicapped man and play him to perfection. The man's talents were so great and yet they were wasted in so many ways after he hit around 30. WHY!!???? Why hollywood? I will despise this about you forever!!  Mickey Rooney should have NEVER EVER NEVER been out of work.  They man could do anything.  Anyway, enough on that....the Bill movies are the best movies I've ever seen. They have changed my life. The character Bill is a sweetheart. He will bless your heart and touch your life.  If you love Mickey Rooney or just a great heartwarming, clean, fun family film you will fall in love with Bill.  I'm 24 years old and I watched this with one of my 18 year old friends and she just balled her eyes out in several parts of this movie and so did I.  You will need a box of tissues.  I promise, keep them on hand.  On the other hand you may need something to help you stop laughing because some of the movie is hilarious.  The movie is worth the price.  Thanks Mickey, thanks for playing Bill to perfection, thanks for giving us your great talent to enjoy. I love you!",1110326400,3,1445,4.335820895522388

346498,5,630167796X,"Mickey Rooney has done it again, with the same convincing performance he gave in Bill. It helps that the same same actors who portrayed Barry and his wife (I admit I forget her name, but Bill always called her Sweetie) are in the sequel, too, along with a young Helen Hunt (the same actress in the movie Twister, and the television series Mad About You). In this movie, Bill is living in a group home with three others, including one played by Edie McClurg whom I adore. The woman who runs the home has problems throughout the movie, including a charge from the zoning board that she has too many boarders. Hunt plays a college student who needs to do a research project, and decides Bill would make a test case for her. She meets him in his coffee shop and, when he asks her to handle the cash register since he is not able to, she decides to set out to teach him things like using a phone and handling money. Okay, maybe it's predictable that he ends up teaching her, but it's done with the same style I enjoyed in the original that I didn't mind. While Barry and his family aren't in the whole movie, they and Bill are reunited, where it's Bill who teaches Barry, after being fired, that he must learn to be on his own just as Bill did. The movie is charming, non-violent, uplifting, optimistic, and well-acted. What more could a movie viewer ask for?",1097452800,,1354,4.376984126984127
346499,5,630167796X,"My roommate was forever complaining of how many movies I taped. Well, looking at a used price of almost $80 for this gem, I am certainly glad it's one I taped from my television! How an actor of normal intelligence can portray a person as mentally-challenged as Bill is a tribute to his mastery. While a lot of people made fun of Bill, or gave him a look of distaste or even fear, a struggling filmmaker and his wife took him into their lives and hearts -- and our hearts, too. Spending decades in a frightful mental institution, Granville, he wanted to forget about it. But when Barry convinced him to return so he could film him there, Bill re-establishes friendships with the patients he left behind. I found the film to be sensitive to the subject in showing Bill's difficulty in comprehending things, but never making fun of him in the process. At the end of the movie, we are treated to a look at the real William (Bill for short) Sackter together with Rooney, and in his annual role as Santa (Bill for short), proving mental illness does not have to prevent one from becoming a member of our society. I can't fault the directing, script, or acting, so if you are not fortunate as I to have already taped it, it really is worth purchasing.",1097452800,8,1245,4.464912280701754

346501,5,630167796X,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young. Maybe 15-20 years ago. I cried everytime I saw it, I just LOVED Bill.
Fast forward to today. I can't get a copy anywhere in any format to show my wife. She's never seen it nor heard of it!
If anyone can help me find a copy, I'd surely compensate you.
Please help me out!",1057190400,5,317,3.96875
346502,5,630167796X,"That's right, the extremely hard to find, out-of-print for who-knows-how-long movies are now available for everyone.  But first let me say a word or two about BILL for those people who know nothing about it.
It's Mickey Rooney's finest performance, as many of his fans who have met him in person have told him.  He portrays William (""Bill for short"") Sackter.  Bill spent 40 years in a Minnesota mental institution.  Sometime after his release he befriended struggling amateur filmmaker Barry Morrow, who would later receive an Academy Award for co-writing the movie RAIN MAN.  Barry and his wife Bev reached out to help Bill probably without realizing that Bill was helping them and all the others who crossed his path.
You see, Bill was the word ""optimistic"" made flesh.  When you see him standing in the ICU hospital room of the little girl, and he's reciting the Lord's Prayer and praying for the little girl...I can't even describe it, except to say it's one of the most powerful scenes that have ever been on my television screen.
This movie (and its sequel) are proof that the entire family can view something wonderful on the television.
...
I also highly recommend Thomas Walz's book, THE UNLIKELY CELEBRITY: BILL SACKTER'S TRIUMPH OVER DISABILITY.  This, thank goodness, is not out of print.",1032307200,23,1301,4.9132420091324205

7814079,4,630167796X,"Bill: On His Own is a sequel to the movie Bill about real-life inspiration Bill Sackter. Sackter was a mentally retarded man who was kept in an insane assylum for over forty years before he was released to cope with society. Friend and film maker Anthony Page documented his life in two made for tv films. In the first movie, Bill (Mickey Rooney) found a friend in film maker Barry Morrow (Dennis Quaid). However, in this second movie, Barry moves to California to start a new career, leaving Bill behind to be a ""good man"" on his own. Bill finds that independence isn't easy, even when he lives with a loving group of people. He finds a potential new friend in student of social work Jenny (Helen Hunt) who pushes Bill to learn to read and count. Her insistance frustrates him and makes him feel like a ""low grade man,"" but her intentions are good.

Rooney is remarkable in his role. One forgets that he is acting, even though he's a familiar face. Hunt is less likable than Quaid's character is, but she represents a common factor when dealing with the mentally disabled. Teresa Wright also appears as Mae, Bill's guardian. Her face will be familiar to classic movie fans for her appearances in films like The Pride of the Yankees and The Best Years of Our Lives.",1190678400,,1265,4.548245614035087

7814081,5,630167796X,"This film is absolute sentiment, but with such a fine actor in the leading role, it is difficult not to fall for the baited hook. Mickey Rooney plays Bill, a mentally retarded man whose life has not been easy. He spent almost 50 years in an insane asylum and has been threatened with returning there if he cannot keep himself out of trouble. Bill is extremely innocent and easily taken advantage of, so trouble is not unknown to him. However, a film maker named Barry (Dennis Quaid) takes an interest in him as a subject and becomes his friend.

The story is simple, but the plot doesn't have to be complex. Rooney is absolutely fascinating to watch. It is easy to forget he is acting; he makes the character so realistic and so lovable. Of course the editing and the music aid that, but really it is Rooney who pulls through. Quaid is also interesting here too in an early role. Even through his character's frustrations and imperfections, he makes his character notable and interesting.

It would be wonderful to see this movie packaged with its sequel on DVD. Because of its stars, people would be interested, and they'd be hooked when they watched the movies.",1157500800,3,1163,4.640776699029126
