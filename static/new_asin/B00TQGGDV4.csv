7020459,5,B00TQGGDV4,"First saw this movie on cable back in the 80s and it's just as funny after all this time. Starring many well known actors (such as Helen Martin, Anne-Marie Johnson, John Witherspoon, and Keenan Ivory Wayans). Looks good on Bluray but was hoping for some bonus material.",1443657600,2,269,4.74468085106383

8702842,4,B00TQGGDV4,"This is a classic film about how those who run Hollywood stereotype all peoples since they control the bank (literally!) and others go into entertainment to get hundreds of thousands or millions - or try winning lotto!  The money being held over everyone's heads is what make people play high-level stereotypical roles or dignified roles.  As history shows, most people follow the paycheck!

This film is about director Robert Townsend and Keenan Ivory Wayan's true life experiences of becoming black actors in Hollywood, so this stands as a great historical record!  This is another one of those films claimed to have been financed on credit cards and every other scrap of money he could come up with.  The result is an entertaining film that (sadly) still stands as valid today, and it also is one rare exception to my ""1:40 minutes or less films suck"" rule!  This one is an hour and 21 minutes and is very good and entertaining.  There are exceptions to every rule.

This film explores genres that black actors wished they could play, but the powers that be in Hollywood refused to let black play.  It also explores the many designated stereotypical roles set aside for blacks to play - which you still see today, but only filled in by British, Caribbeans and Africans.  These days, acting gigs for black AMERICANS are being totally bypassed for foreigners playing black Americans!  So this Hollywood Shuffle story seems to have ended up even WORSE for black actors in Hollywood, as black AMERICAN actors have been replaced by the powers that be for foreign blacks, whom they try to pass off as black Americans.  Now you see who they got to play slaves and black American historical figures.  This is a part of the ""Britishing up"" of the US so they can ""make America Great (Britain) again.""

Picture wise, this one was clearly scanned through the machine without any effort to retouch anything in regards to color grading.  Gamma is the biggest problem in the opening scenes as skin looks cartoonish - for 1080P.  Things start improving and looking very good as the film progresses, even looking BD ready.  Detail is strong, given the era of film where sounds were muffled and picture quality was - weird and dull.  If color correction had been done, the picture could be worth a 5 for 1080P, but colors looked vibrant in one scene, then weak in another.  I read the movie was filmed with a combination of 16mm and 35mm film.  Given that - it looked good.

Sound was very good and not muffled as many films from the era were.  Sometimes studios have a tendency to make the highs too high, which takes away from the overall sound - especially on STEREO releases.  I know that asking for 5.1 would be too much to ask for, but I am so used to and loving sound coming from the center channel speaker to the point that I would prefer mono (for older films) rather than stereo!  The sound is good for what it is.

This film was one of those generic Blu-Ray releases in which the studio did not remaster anything or make any improvements - they simply scanned it into the machine and let it roll.  For a lot of catalog films, this can work, but sometimes color correction can make all the difference in presentation.

Video:  3.5 Stars - Color is the biggest issue.  Despite coming from an era of poor film quality, details pop, clarity is there and you do see the 1080P
  jump in quality versus all previous versions.

Audio:  2 Stars  -  Nothing special but basic stereo sound.  The good part is it does not sound like VHS HiFi audio and it is clear, but nothing to get
  excited about.

Overall: 3.5 Stars - Based on technical quality alone.  4 stars based on film significance and entertainment.",1521590400,,3695,4.615975422427035

8702845,5,B00TQGGDV4,"I actually grew up literally 'down the street' from Robert Townsend on the West Side of Chicago (while I often saw him in the neighborhood I never knew him) and I thought his first foray into writing, producing, starring and directing this 'classic' was 'spot on'! Everyone by now has heard the 'credit card story' and how he financed his movie but give him credit...it takes a lot of heart to go that far to fulfill your vision! Excellent movie, funny, insightful with a very strong message about 'self'!",1508371200,2,505,4.685393258426966
