8134906,5,B000GW8TDW,"I love these short but challenging workouts!  They can be used as stand alones or combined for a longer and more complete workout. Although all of the workouts are good, my favorite of the Garden Series 2 is the Standing Abs, which really challenges your balance. The other favorite is the Lunges and Raises which really work the quads. The Inner/Outer Thighs are challenging too. You will feel the burn. The moves are creative and fun. You will not find moves like these anywhere else and the garden background is very charming. For quick, creative and effective workouts I highly recommend this series.",1517184000,,604,4.864077669902913

8134908,5,B000GW8TDW,"The garden series is awesome! Not only are the workouts so unique, it's lovely to workout to her scenery. These workouts are great lengths and I love to combine them together. If you want to gain strength and definition then I highly reccomend.",1490745600,,244,4.6976744186046515
8134909,5,B000GW8TDW,"The scenery in these Garden workouts makes me feel so calm and I try to fit portions of them in on busy mornings to lower my stress before work. Barlates is a type of workout style that sneaks up on you-it looks low key but the toning is incredible and I feel a serious burn in my muscles,to the point of shaking. At age 50 I can no longer do pounding cardio and had gotten bored with heavy lifting,which tended to bulk me-these are feel good workouts!!",1489795200,,453,4.218390804597701
