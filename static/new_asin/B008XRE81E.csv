5189655,5,B008XRE81E,"This product is great. For the first time ever you get all 3 seasons of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers on DVD. 155 episodes in total including the alien Rangers mini series which is part of the season three set. If your wondering about quality you won't be disappointed unless you where expecting hi-def. For its age the quality is excellent. There are however a few audio glitches on some episodes notable Venus Island. As for bonus features this set delivers with some really incredible never before seen stuff including a hidden Easter egg. Cast interviews and retrospective views from fans highlight 2 discs of amazing bonus features. As for the box itself the artwork is terrific and the outer case is made of nice firm cardboard for lack of a better term. The DVD cases are beautifully done and besides the Dino thunder used green ranger it's perfect. Also included in the set is a booklet containing loads of information. Charter bios, complete episode guide with a brief sentence or two about the episode, never before seen pictures and a nice intro about the power rangers storyline. The booklet really made this set EXTREMLY awesome. I would highly recommend this to any ranger fan young or old. Even if these aren't your favorite seasons, support the set so we can continue to get more seasons and great box sets like this one.",1347926400,81,1336,4.762931034482759

5189670,5,B008XRE81E,"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Complete Series.  This is a complete collection of the Power Ranger TV series which aired in the 1990s.  This 'Boxed Set' has seasons: 1, 2, and 3, + bonus features.  If you are a MMPR fan, you are bound to enjoy watching these.  I bought these because I never saw the first few episodes when I was in my early 20s. I also love - - Amy Jo Johnson!

This particular series (MMPR) really progressed in style from Season 1 up to Season 3.  I thought that all of the stories were very, very good and well put together - - 'most' of the 'in costume' fighting sequences are from the 3 different Japanese Ranger TV series called: Zyuranger, Dairanger, and Kakuranger (I am pretty sure of this).

I thought that this series was an English dubbed show from Japan when I first saw the commercials for the First Season of MMPR back in the 1990s, but it turned out that Saban edited the shows from Japan and combined the American actors: Amy Jo Johnson, David Yost, Jason David Frank, Austin St. John, Thuy Trang, and Walter Emanuel Jones, etc. with the 'in costumed' fight sequences - along with some of the monster scenes - and the Zord Battles.

The six discs for the first season are in one case instead of being split into volumes.  In fact, it's the same Complete First Season case that Walmart has been selling exclusively.  The case for the Complete Second Season is the same way.  The season 3 set included is the individual season 3 set that's being sold without the Alien Rangers disc in it, and the individual release of the Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers set is in this box set instead.  The thinpak that holds the two bonus discs is the exact same way it was in the original box set, and the included booklet's front cover is that of the cover art of the original set.",1476835200,45,766,4.442857142857143

I'm just happy Saban bought the rights back and gave shoutfactory distribution rights for Power Rangers.

5189734,3,B008XRE81E,"I recently bought this box set during a one day sale. For what I paid, it was worth it for the pure nostalgia trip!

Now this review is mainly going to focus on the video quality of Season 1 alone; not the content itself, audio, extras, etc.

For those interested, Season 1 is spread over 6 DVDs containing 10 episodes per disc (Which is a red flag as cramming too much video footage onto one DVD will affect video quality). All footage is interlaced. Each disc is a dual-layered DVD-9.

I popped the first disc into a blu-ray player and all the footage seemed grainy. Not to mention there were some very noticeable compression artifacts (Most noticeable during the scrolling credits after each episode). The FBI warning was of higher quality than the episodes themselves. To be fair, this is an old show and none of us know how the masters have held up.

Tried the discs on a PS3 and VLC in Windows. Graininess. But I'll live with it. It's not like I can return these or anything.

Perhaps I'm being nitpicky given the sheer amount of content in the box set. But video quality is important to me and the regular asking price seems quite steep for what Shout! Factory gave us. For DVDs produced in 2012, I expected more.",1434153600,3,1220,4.4774774774774775

Having watched the series when it was originally on TV it was great to seen the video quality so much higher than it was, which allows for various details to be visible, including anomalies left over from the original Japanese version. These allow for subtle hints about the differences in some episodes between versions, meaning that if I weren't already a fan of Zyuranger, I would be very curious to watch it.

5189770,5,B008XRE81E,"I first want to comment that I tend to look upon this and the seasons 4-7 boxed set as belonging together, along with Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.  The reason for that is because they continue the storyline that is started with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  If you really don't like the following shows, I'd still at least recommend for you to buy the Power Rangers: Zeo DVDs, as Zeo primarily resolves what is mostly unresolved here.  Anyway, let's talk about Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Complete Series

Today, with Power Rangers, every season is a different show, with a different storyline.  However, it wasn't originally the case.  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers lasted three seasons, and although it went through many changes, it continued on being the same show.

Season 1 is a fairly strong starting point.  It doesn't have much plot in it.  However, I don't have a problem with each episode simply being another monster of the day, and there isn't much of a larger storyline.  There's the first episode where everything is introduced, the second and third episodes add a bit more gear and equipment, but after that, it just follows an episodic formula.  The episodes are very enjoyable, and we get really familiar with the characters.  Jason, Zack, Trini, Billy, and Kimberly are presented well, and we get very comfortable with them as a team.  The true stars, however, are Bulk and Skull, who do some great physical comedy (just watch the detention scene in A Bad Reflection on You).  They have cool weapons that combine into a big blaster, and they have zords that are dinosaur themed (in fact, everything they have is primarily dinosaur themed).  After several episodes following a formula with the five rangers, there's a five-part episode miniseries where we meet a new character.  Tommy is introduced in the Green With Evil saga (a five-part episode, or miniseries, as each episode is given it's own subtitle), which some fans have considered to be padded out, but it does have much excitement.  We then have more episodes following the same formula, with him there, then he leaves, and then comes back.  The first season doesn't really have any big storyline.  However, the episodes are very enjoyable, and the first season has some of the best monsters that the rangers face.  Also, although the storyline gets darker later on, I feel that this season possibly had the darkest atmosphere (it might have just been the color of the film, or maybe something else).

Season 2 goes through a lot of changes.  In the first season, Rita Repulsa, the villain, is a sorceress with a not-so-scary dress, a funny hairstyle, and she gets a headache whenever she's defeated.  She also has an assistant who uses a machine to make monsters, and when she wants to go very extreme, she might recite a long incantation.  However, in season 2, she is immediately replaced by Lord Zedd, a giant being of muscle, wearing a metallic mask, that can instantly summon monsters with his staff.  He also turns red whenever he gets mad.  The rangers also have their dinosaur-themed zords replaced with what they call thunder zords, which are mythology-themed.  Zedd and the thunder zords are introduced in a three-part episode, and then we develop the first major story-arc, which is about Tommy losing his powers.  It's concluded in a two-part episode where he loses them, and then we have a few episodes where he isn't there (but he's talked about).  However, Tommy returns as the white ranger in a two-part episode, and shortly after, we get introduced to three new people that become friends with the rangers.  There's also a subplot about a peace conference, where Jason, Zack, and Trini end up being sent to be ambassadors there.  These new characters, Rocky, Adam, and Aisha take their places as power rangers.  There are quite a few episodes using the formula, with this new team.  After several great episodes, Rita returns and marries Lord Zedd.  The intention was to soften Lord Zedd up, but he doesn't seem that different, and we get a bunch of multi-part episodes.  Season 3 starts out with a fairly dark tone, but it gets lighter as time goes on.

Season 3 begins with a three-part episode, primarily meant to introduce a new spin-off show.  I'll admit that I feel it to be a great episode.  It is then followed by Ninja Quest, a four-part episode, with a similar storyline to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.  However, I personally feel that Ninja Quest, although on a smaller scale with a lower budget, is much better.  We are introduced to the new character of Rito Revolto, a giant skeleton that is somewhat clumsy, and has a silly personality.  He is Rita Repulsa's brother, and helps them out.  The rangers also get new ninja powers, in addition to their ninja zords.  Their ninja costumes look fantastic, and although I personally prefer the thunder zords, many fans favor the ninja zords (and I can understand why).  We then get several episodes following formula, but then have a nine episode story-arc, with two three-parters, a two-parter, and a single episode, where we are introduced to a new villain, Katherine.  Katherine (aka Kat), is a spy, befriending the rangers as a human, and also spying on them as a cat.  Although many fans hate her, I think she is introduced well.  In a three-part episode here, she breaks an evil spell that is cast upon her, retrieves a stolen power coin, helps one of the rangers conquer her fears, and then she is selected by that ranger to take her place.  Kat proves herself to be awesome.  We don't really get too many more formulaic episodes before we're introduced to another new villain, Master Vile.  He turns out to be Rita Repulsa's father, and he is presented as being a very wise villain.  We are also introduced to the zeo crystal, which the rangers split into five shards and scatter them across time.  Shortly after, the third season itself ends on a cliffhanger where time is reversed, and the rangers are turned into kids.  This season has been the darkest season storyline-wise, and I feel has a lighter tone to it, but overall, it gets more emotional than the previous seasons.

Season 3.5 is a ten-part miniseries (retitled Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers), where the rangers are now children, and so they can't use their powers.  Despite that, they still do what they can to face the villains.  However, it is decided to transport power rangers from another planet to help them out. Except for Billy, who made himself an adult again, the rangers go on their own separate quests to find the zeo crystal.  It ends where they each get their shards, the spell on time is reversed, but crystal is stolen, and their command center is blown up, ending Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (or Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ended on a different cliffhanger).  This is a quick season, and I'll admit to having never watched the episodes individually, but I always watch them as part of a marathon (usually with the last episode of the third season beforehand, and the two-part opening of Power Rangers Zeo afterwards).  Although it is presented in the most light and comical way, it has some very touching moments, and every episode ends on a cliffhanger.

The special features here are fantastic.  We get a documentary about the show itself, one getting into detail about each cast member, and a documentary on the fans.  Two other features are a couple of straight-to-video episodes that were basically clip shows.  One of these was Lord Zedd's Monster Heads, the other was a Bulk and Skull clip show (The Good, the Bad, and the Stupid).  The rest are also straight-to-video releases, a Power Rangers Christmas video, an instructional karate video, the fan club video, and a film of the Power Rangers Live show.  The documentaries are pretty good, and very informative on Power Rangers.  The clip-shows are enjoyable, but they are basically just clip shows.  The Christmas video has a similar format to that of an episode of Barney, and most fans seem to despise it.  I'll admit, it is very cheesy.  The film of the live show is okay, but the main reason for the live show was to give kids a chance to see the power rangers in person.  It has a monster and storyline that would have made a decent episode for the TV show (or even a movie), but unfortunately, this is what we have.  The fan club video is very enjoyable, and it adds some fun bits of information about the original six ranger characters (along with a brief backstory on their master, Zordon).  The instructional karate video is pretty good.  However, I'll admit that this set is missing what I consider to be a preferable karate video.  The one included here is The White Ranger Kata video, but I think that The Green Ranger Kata video was much better, mostly due to the fact that it had more reference to Power Rangers in it.  However, this might have been a more informative karate video than the original.  That is the only major misstep I have for this boxed set.  The other one is that for I'm Dreaming of a White Ranger, they use the version that was show on television, instead of the slightly longer straight-to-video version of it (which I'll admit, include a scene that messes with the continuity).  There are other things they could have included, a music video commercial for a bunch of releases, toy commercials, Power Ranger public service announcements, and a whole lot more.  They could have possibly had two more discs of features, but what is primarily desired is included.  As the features are bonuses to the main content, the show itself, I'm not going to be too harsh on that.

Overall, I recommend this, but I do recommend buying it alongside either just the Power Rangers Zeo DVDs, or the Seasons 4-7 boxed set and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.  It's Morphenomenal!",1413072000,,9851,4.76401179941003

5189788,5,B008XRE81E,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is my all time favorites. This entire season is how ""The Power"" begins. I have been watching those seasons since 1993 and I loved them. Here is the complete season guide.

Season 1: Power Rangers vs. Rita Repulsa. This is how it all begin. Zordon, a kind and wise wizard choses 5 teens with attitude to fight a mad witch named Rita Repulsa and her gang of monsters like Goldar. Later in this season, a 5 part episode called Green With Evil, Rita will chose a 6th Power Ranger and my all time favorite: Tommy Oliver aka Green Ranger.

Season 2: Power Rangers vs. Lord Zedd. After Rita failed too many times while battling the Power Rangers, Zedd, Rita's boss and future husband fires her and he will deal with our heroes himself. White Light, one of my favorite 2 part episode, Tommy lost his Green Ranger powers and he got new powers and he become the new White Ranger. 3 of the original Power Rangers will be replaced with new members.

Season 3: Power Rangers vs. Rita and Zedd. The battle between our heroes against Zedd and Rita is become more deadly. This season is one of the darkest and tragic season in Power Rangers history. Our heroes' Thunderzords were obliterated by Rito Revolto, Rita's brother. In this season, our heroes will get new zords, a new member to replace, new allies, new armor, and a deadly and dangerous enemy.

Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers aka The End. Our heroes are turned to kids and their Power Coins were obliterated by Rita and Zedd. Zordon recruits the Alien Rangers to battle Rita and Zedd until our heroes get the Zeo Crystal back and everything will turn back to normal.

5189795,5,B008XRE81E,"In August 1993 I was just a seven year old boy who watched the pilot episode of MMPR called ""Day of The Dumpster"" with Rita Repulsa escaping from her dumpster to wreck havoc when the power rangers were then called by Zordon to protect the world from her endless monsters. The very first episode completely got me hooked into the show and MMPR became that one show that brought happiness into my childhood years and this was a good thing cause I did not have the best childhood. Power Rangers had such a huge effect on me I literally remember going to school for Halloween (I turned 8 by then) as the red ranger! This show was something that was not unlike most of what you saw then and even now. The colorful suits, the action, the monsters, and always loved how Rita threw her wand down to earth to make her monsters gigantic she was such a classic. As a child I think I feel in love with it more for the action and monsters and but 21 years later now as a 28 year old able to relive my childhood memories I fell in love with it on a production level as MMPR as well as every season since uses Japanese footage from a show in Japan called ""Super Sentai"" that has been on since the 1970's. I actually never knew this as a child so I was shocked to find this out as an adult but even so I even gained even more respect for MMPR for using original storylines from footage of another show. MMPR does not focus solely on action on monsters but also martial arts when the characters are not in suits and the positive aspects it brings into their lives. And really overall becoming good citizens from charity work to finding positive things to do when the world didn't need to be saved. Because of me reliving the best show 21 years later I now have plans to take martial arts classes because of power rangers I even remember starting to take classes as a child but due to my heavy shyness and scared around others I eventually quit but I know once I get settled in AZ when I move there I will start taking classes and I can say I was influenced by MMPR to do so!",1399939200,,2057,4.196969696969697

The box set is presented really well and looks cracking on my shelf. The special features are great to see and the accompanying book is a nice touch. Some of the footage is a little on the grainy side but hey, the Japanese footage in particular is well over 20 years old so it's to be expected and didn't hinder my enjoyment of rewatching the episodes. All in all, I'm incredibly pleased with my purchase and may well get the next box set too. If you fancy a stroll down memory lane, I recommend it wholeheartedly.

5189804,4,B008XRE81E,"now make no mistake it was very much a memorable experience watching it and seeing what i saw in days of old HOWEVER....
i was watching it with my friend who was a RTF major and both her and I could tell THEY SPLICED IN Japanese footage while in the end it didn't affect the experience TOO MUCH but as bad as saban is it never affected the quality of the picture. the picture maybe that was because it was on TV maybe not but on DVD it shouldn't have been that grainy fortunately it was mostly during the megazord fights so not so bad but truth be told whoever put this DVD collection should have been more on top of picture quality control. the memories are there the corniness the villain speeches the repetitive ""I am gonna get those rangers"" oh hell even one obvious mistake with ninjor's  double blade  it was all there in all its corny glory made me laugh sometimes other times a bit upset(departure of rangers)now one of the most enjoyable things i found was in the bonus features but i leave that for you to discover. overall it does still earn the four stars i gave it. it is an enjoyable product as long as you can tolerate the  aforementioned flaws so.... would i recommend this?yes in spite of its flaws i would still recommend it.",1394150400,,1243,4.349137931034483
5189805,5,B008XRE81E,"When Power Rangers debuted back in 1993, I was on the cusp of becoming a teenager (I was so close, in fact, because the show debuted the very month I turned 13) so you would think that I was over such shows and moving on to more ""teenage-type"" things. But the show had me from the first episode. I had experienced shows where people piloted giant machines (Voltron, anyone?) so I was not lost on the concept (a fact a friend of mine pointed out while we were watching the show very early on in the first season). But there was something different here. Not only because Rangers was not a cartoon (that much was obvious), but also because the teenagers, when not morphed, seemed more....real? True to life? Something. Maybe it was because I wanted to be like them as a teenager, or maybe it was because the show itself took me away from a hard point in my life with every episode. Whatever the case, I loved the show then and I still love it to this day, and I'm not ashamed to say that. I've seen most of the seasons (some of them were hard to follow when the series began to jump networks, from Fox to ABC, then to ABC Family, and eventually to Nickelodeon), but I've tried to keep up with them. I plan on getting every mega set that comes out so that I can relive the adventures of every incarnation of Rangers. So, if you love action and adventure, you grew up with the Rangers like I did and want to relive the fun, or you even just want to see what all the fuss is about, start here. You won't regret it.",1394150400,2,1509,4.206896551724138
5189806,5,B008XRE81E,"August 28th, 1993 marked the beginning of an era, though nobody realized it. On that day, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" began broadcasting it's (at the time) 40 episode run. Using dubbed-over stock footage from an obscure Japanese show called ""Super Sentai"" in conjunction with American-shot footage, nobody anticipated how much the show would explode! Forty episodes became sixty. Sixty became one-hundred-and-two. One-hundred-and-two became one-hundred-and-fifty-five. Now, the episode count is well into the seven-hundreds! Twenty years later, there's no sign of the Power Rangers slowing down.

You would think that, at some point during those twenty years, someone would have thought ""Hey, let's release the show on home video. There's clearly a market for it!"" Well, Shout! Factory finally did it. And the set is quality! The show itself, however...

Ripping into this set, I was so excited to see my favorite show back on my television set. All 155 episodes of the first three seasons are included. This includes the 10-episode ""Alien Ranger"" arc at the tail of season 3. Like a kid at Christmas, I popped in Season 1, Disc 1 (where else would you start?) and prepared for awesomeness!

I underestimated how long it had been since I actually watched the original series. About thirty seconds in, I thought, ""This is what I held in high regard for nearly twenty years?"" The show is actually extremely cheesy, and I realized this long ago. But it wasn't until I rewatched the early episodes that I realized how bad it was. I mean, just thinking about some of these episodes (""Trick or Treat"" is a gem in strangeness), it's bizzare enough to make even Tim Burton go, ""WTF?"" But for those who have waited this long for a DVD release, suffering through cheese is a worthwhile price to pay.

But as if the show itself wasn't reason enough to buy the set, Shout! Factory has gone through all the trouble to not only bring us the show on DVD, but to also bring us a HIGH QUALITY boxed set. I mean, no expense was spared! Well, maybe a little bit was. But not by much.

The show comes in 5 cases, all housed in one box. And the box itself is quality. Nice, sturdy cardboard with reflective foil paper. Shiny! The discs themselves; seasons 1 and 2 are split across four cases, three discs in each, while Season 3/Alien Rangers are housed in one case of 5 discs. Why they didn't put all od Season 1 and 2 in a single case for each is anybody's guess, but the artwork is awesome, and consistent.

To make this set even better, there are TWO discs full of bonus features! Featuring new interviews with cast, crew, fans, the long-lost home video specials, the Power Rangers Live World Tour video, and even the original pitch video (a hidden easter egg), as well as an episode guide-book with episode descriptions and character bios (the only thing missing is a listing of the original air-dates, but that's solely a minor nitpick), Shout! Factory has made this set well worth your time and money, even if the show doesn't quite live up to your nostalgic expectations.",1394150400,,3061,4.766037735849056

5189810,5,B008XRE81E,"Ahhhhhh after 20 years its here! It's time to conquer all 155 episodes!

Is Power Rangers over the top acting? NO. Is it the highest production value? NO. Is it the most well written show to ever hit television? NO. But does in capture the heart of a generation? YES.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is that really gross looking fast food burger that tastes DELICIOUS once you start digging in. Now if you didn't grow up with Power Rangers you may not appreciate its repetitive bright charm.

Shout Factory always takes care of its products. The Metallic case is truly stunning with logos and custom artwork on every side. Inside five clear dvd cases are housed with each case having a different Rangers head on the binding. In addition to the 155 episodes included, it also comes with a guidebook and bonus features dvd. The bonus features disc was put together specifically for this release interviewing the actors who played most of the rangers.

This is a must have for any fan of Power Rangers period. My only advice when purchasing it is to watch the price, it is know to fluctuate quite often. I picked mine up for $60 off amazon about 6 months ago. Still, this is a great collection that will provide hours of nostalgic fun with friends.

5189814,5,B008XRE81E,"Since it first aired in 1993, the original series of Power Rangers has continued to enjoy great popularity. I used to be a big fan of it as a kid (this was in the mid-late 90s) and I have rediscovered how great it is again. Well, the first season and the first half of Season 2 were great, the rest of it was really mixed. The original five Rangers - Jason played by Austin St. John, Trini played by the late Thuy Trang, Zack played by Walter Jones, Kimberly played by Amy Jo Johnson & Billy played by David Yost - were so unique and dynamic, and when Austin, Walter and Thuy left, the show lost a huge part of its appeal. They also lost all those important moral lessons that they included in each episode that featured the original 5.

For my part, I did like the sucessor Rangers of Rocky (played by Steve Carendas), Katherine (played by Catherine Sutherland) and Aishia (played by Karen Ashley). I personally never took to Adam, played by Johnny Young Bosch, and I never liked Tommy Oliver played by Jason David Frank. Tommy is an excellent villain, but I've never been able to take him seriously as a good Ranger - much less Jason's [abrupt] successor as team leader. I'm also not that fond of JDF himself, mostly because he's been saying horrible things about Austin for years.

Nevertheless, for any Rangers fan, anyone who was a kid in the 1990s or anyone who is interested in looking at this great show, I highly recommend it.",1391299200,,1435,4.452471482889734

5189822,3,B008XRE81E,"I never planned on writing any review for anything on here, but I feel compelled to write this. I grew up with this show as did almost all the people that have written reviews on here did. There's no need to cover what it is and how it is much. It's camp at it's finest. Low budget, poorly acted, cheesy writing. It's great nostalgia for anyone who grew up on this. It awakens the inner kid every time you watch.

Now for my complaints. Which are big in my opinion. The quality of these episodes ranges from mediocre, to slightly bad, to down right terrible. You can tell much work didn't go into touching up these episodes. They look like marginally cleaned VHS versions on my 32 inch HD TV and 22 inch monitor. I was rather surprised about that.

Next is the packaging. Each box contains three disc with plastic disc holders that are on a plastic pivot that allows them to swing back and forth. When mine arrived the second box set had already the plastic connectors that held them together snapped off and rattling in the box. So now the whole disc holders swing freely inside the box. I first thought this was a shipping problem, but a day after that the first box which had been fine the previous day before hand also broke with the plastic holders.

It's great for the nostalgia. If the quality was better on the both the episodes and packaging this might have gotten a 5. It's still worth it for anyone wanting to relive their childhood. Just not at full price.",1387324800,,1468,4.409594095940959

Watching the 5 part episode where Tommy is the green ranger and working for Rita Repulsa, I was instantly transported back to that time in my life (which was around 4th grade I think) and I remembered saturday mornings I had spent watching an episode, then talking with my friends about it at school.

5189848,5,B008XRE81E,"For me, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers were a kind of refuge from the hardships of my daily life.
In the summer of 1994, I bought one of the last SEGA CD video game systems. Included in the package was something called ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.""
It was most likely included so it could be gotten rid of as the game probably didn't sell very well.
""Oh well"" my 15 year-old self thought as I slid the CD in to the system and heard rida proclaiming that it was ""TIME TO concor EARTH!""
It was my first intro to quick time event gaming, and; through about 35 minutes of incredibly snowy video clips; I played through what I eventually found out was most of the major parts of season 1.
I wasn't what you'd call immediately hooked, but I gradually began to like the show more as I watched more of it.
A complete, legal DVD set of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has been a long time in coming, but now that it's here, I decided to buy it to collect a lot of my teen-year memories.
I don't regret my purchase one bit!
Considering the show's age, the quality on display is amazing. Most shows have near perfect audio and visual presentation.
All of the discs have a play all option, and all episodes have about 6 chapter stops per show.
The set comes in an attractive sturdy box that holds all of the DVD discs.
Seasons 1 and 2 come in two cases each that hold a total of 3 discs.
Season 3 and alien rangers come in one case; 3 on 4 discs and alien rangers; or season 3.5 as it is called is on the last disc.
All of these discs can be bought separately with alien rangers coming in its own release separate from season 3.
the exclusive extras start with a booklet that covers all of the rangers and contains some back-story from the series.
The really good stuff comes on the two extra DVD discs that come in there own slim case.
In all you get about 90 minutes of all-new extras in 3 features, one on the series itself, one on the casting, and another on the fans.
You also get every VHS release between 94 and 95.
This includes Lord Zedd's monster heads, Alpha's Magical Christmas, the Good the Bad and the Stupid, the fan club video fans got when they became JR. Power rangers, the white ranger kata; basically a work-out video, and the live tour. Over-all a treasure-trove of content all in better quality than you probably saw them in on VHS tapes when they were originally released.
Regrettably, only the white ranger kata and live tour have chapter stops, but hay what can you do.
Both discs also have a play all option.
The packaging also has some issues, particularly with the green ranger. I guess they had trouble getting good picks of the green ranger or something, but aside from that, shout! has done an excellent job with this set and I can't wait for the rest of the set to come out.
Price brake-down: If you buy every part of the set individually you'll spend about 80 dollars anyway, so if you can get this set for about that or cheaper, you'll be getting an incredible deal, over 150 episodes!",1373241600,10,3012,4.332743362831859

There's action, there's adventure, there's heart, and more than anything there's fun.  This is a very well put together product with some awesome special features including an easter egg of the demo reel Haim Saban used to promote the concept of the show before any real filming was done.  If you were a kid during the '90s and loved MMPR this set won't disappoint.  If you're looking for something to entertain your kids, this is a great set.

5189867,5,B008XRE81E,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Complete Series. What a great box set this is. Anybody who doesn't already own this should buy this as quickly as possible. For starters, this includes all 3 seasons of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and includes the 10 episode miniseries Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. In total, that's 155 episodes. You have 60 episodes for Season 1, 52 for Season 2, and 33 for Season 3, and of course the 10 for Alien Rangers. Not to mention, there are a bunch of brand new, never-before seen special features.

Mighty Morphin Season 1 was an overall good start to the series. You have the first 5 rangers (Jason, Trini, Billy, Kimberly, and Zack) being picked by Zordon and his assistant Alpha 5 to become the first team of Rangers to battle against Rita Repulsa's evil minions. Tommy, the Green Ranger, is at first selected to be evil and to destroy the other Rangers, but eventually joins the team to fight against Rita. He later loses his powers, and gives the Dragonzord coin to Jason to use. Tommy later gets his powers back, although they are weakened, and once again helps the Rangers fight against Rita. Other cool things about the season are the Dinozords, the Dragonzord, and Titanus, which all can combine to form the first Ultrazord ever. Plus you have the comedy relief of Bulk and Skull who are always bullying the other rangers as well as trying to get dates with Trini and Kimberly, and not to mention Zack's numerous attempts at getting Angela's attention.

Mighty Morphin Season 2 introduces to us a new villain of the series: Lord Zedd, who is basically Rita's boss. He comes in to take Rita's place, and banishes her back to her Space Dumpster and sends her flying through space. Zedd's magic is so strong for the Rangers, that they are forced to upgrade to new zords: The Thunderzords, with the exception of Tommy, whose Green Ranger powers are slowly starting to fail (he still uses the Dragonzord a couple of times until his powers are gone for good). When Tommy loses his Green Ranger powers, he comes back as the White Ranger and gains control of the Tigerzord, along with his talking sword Saba at his side. Later on however, the Rangers meet 3 teens from another high school, named Rocky DeSantos, Aisha Campbell, and Adam Park. These 3 teens are later selected to become the new Red,Yellow, and Black Rangers to replace Jason, Trini, and Zack when they are ""selected"" to attend the World Peace Summit in Switzerland. The Rangers then also gain Tor the Shuttlezord, and with it they can form the Thunder Ultrazord. Rita comes back later and with Finster's help, forces Zedd to fall in love with her and they get married. Bulk and Skull pretty much spend this entire season trying to expose the Ranger's secret identities. Plus the summer after this season ended is when Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie was released in theaters (which is not included in this set, you have to get it separately if you want it.)

Mighty Morphin Season 3 introduces a new TV series called Masked Rider, which is introduced in the 3 part episode ""A Friend in Need"" when the Rangers, except for Kimberly travel to Alpha 5's home planet of Edinoi to help them out. In the 4 part episode Ninja Quest, Rito Revolto is introduced as Rita's brother who successfully destroys the Thunderzords and damages the Rangers' Power Coins. The Rangers are then forced to search in the Desert of Despair for the Ninja Temple and Ninjor, who created the first 6 Power Coins, to give the Rangers their new Ninja Powers, along with the new Ninja Zords. Later this season, we are introduced to Katherine ""Kat"" Hilliard, who is under Rita's control and takes Kimberly's Power Coin as well as the Falconzord, and Ninjor is kidnapped by Goldar. The Rangers then use the Shogun Zords, and the Rangers later are able to use the Ninja Zords once again when Kimberly is selected to train in the Pan Global Games in Florida, and Kimberly passes her powers on to Kat. Then later on Rita and Rito's father Master Vile comes in and gives the Rangers more trouble. He is there to search for the Zeo Crystal, which Tommy finds, and Zordon has the Rangers split it up and send it through a time portal to different periods of time. He even successfully uses the Orb of Doom to reverse time on Earth and reduces the Rangers to Powerless children (something Zedd did in Season 2, but failed Miserably), which then ends Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and leads into Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers.

In Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, the Rangers are still Powerless children and luckily are able to get back to the Command Center. Zordon and the Rangers then contact Aquitar to ask the Alien Rangers to come to Earth and help protect it while the child Rangers find a way to restore Earth to it's correct time. A couple episodes in to the miniseries Billy manages to invent a device that uses the Power Coins to restore themselves to their correct age. Unfortunately Zedd, Rita, and their minions successfully find the device and destroy it along with the Power Coins. Zordon then tells the children Rangers there is only one way to restore Earth to it's correct time: They must travel in time to find the shards of the Zeo Crystal. Rocky goes to find the Blue Crystal first, then Adam finds his Green Crystal, then Tommy and Kat find their Red and Pink Crystals (also Tommy encounters an old relative of his who gives him half of an arrowhead, which it is explained further what it is in Zeo). Aisha is the last to find hers, but decides to stay in Africa to help the dying animals of the land, and sends her new friend Tanya in her place. Meanwhile, Zedd and Rita sent Rito and Goldar to plant an explosive device in the Command Center, and at the same time they summoned the Hydro Hog from Aquitar, who is the Alien Rangers' greatest threat. With the Alien Rangers using the Shogun MegaFalconzord, they destroy Hydro Hog for good. The Rangers use the Zeo Crystal to restore everybody to their correct ages and the Earth to it's correct time. As the Rangers except for Tanya say their goodbyes to the Alien Rangers and thanking them for the help, Rito and Goldar steal the completed Zeo Crystal as the other Rangers get back to the Command Center. Just then the explosive device activates and Alpha teleports the Rangers to safety just as the Command Center blows up while the Rangers watch. The series ends in a cliffhanger as the Rangers are unsure of the fates of Zordon and Alpha.

So all in all, if you are a fan of Power Rangers, I highly suggest you get this set, whether you're an old fan or a new one.",1365897600,9,6603,4.61139455782313

5189883,5,B008XRE81E,"For years in Germany and Great Britain, they got the whole of seasons 1-15 while we here in the US got saddled with one complete season (the derided Operation Overdrive) and incomplete volume releases (though SPD was the closest with 26 out of 38 episodes released). It took Saban buying it back and after two years, fans finally get all of Mighty Morphin' (or if you ordered from Time Life, Zeo through Lost Galaxy as well). I had already seen the entire series on youtube (in varying quality until Space) and was going to rewatch on Netflix but I hate when the quality would go in and out so when I heard that it was finally coming out in a complete set, this was a definite buy.

These episodes bring back many fond memories of my youth, coming home after school in 93-94 and I would get home just in time (4:30 I think) and I also remember the second season premiere coming on in primetime and I was shocked (not scared) when Lord Zedd took over. Out of the 155 episodes featured on here, I generally like them all and don't consider them a chore to get through. Granted I do have my favorites, generally the multi-part stories (except the Island of Illuson, The Ninja Encounter,  Storybook Rangers and Stop the Hate Master) along with a few one offs such as Day of the Dumpster, Football Season, Mighty Morphin' Mutants and The Power Stealer. If I had to pick an episode I really hate it would have to be Food Fight. Not because it's a bad episode but when Disney was re-airing season one with it's comic book-esque effects and almost every other week, they'd show rerun this particular episode (about 6 or 7 times in all) during the three month span it took to air the evil Green Ranger episodes. My favorite overall season would probably be the third since that was the season where the most story took place and seemed to have the best writing up to that point. You had the Ninja Quest series followed by a lot of filler but there were mentions of a big gymnastics thingy coming up and that Kimberly was training very hard which led into her exiting story arc that introduced her replacement. A few episodes later, they set up the Zeo Crystal in the Master Vile three parter and (for once) actually have it pay off when they're turned into children during the Alien Rangers mini-series.

With these seasons, my favorite male Ranger was Billy (I don't remember why) but after watching this, he (in my opinion) was the only Ranger to get actual development. He started out as the typical geek and never really fought with the others. I can't recall the episode exactly but the four guys teleported to help the girls and he was the first to jump at the chance to protect Trini who had gotten injured (I know primarily it's out of concern but at that point he never fought outside of the costume). But seeing that throughout season 1, he got better at martial arts and eventually did join in the unmorphed fights. In seasons 2 and 3, I view him more as second in command with Kimberly after Jason and the others left, and at times he felt more competent than Tommy (don't get me wrong I do like Tommy but I call bullcrap with him being made leader when he became White Ranger, he never displayed any leadership qualities before hand and was often shown to be quite forgetful). I especially like the episode where he took on Brick Bully solo. Weird as that was more of a Kat centered episode but that's how the footage goes. Favorite female Ranger would probably be Kim since I feel she received the next amount of development. There's not much reason behind it other than the fact that out of the females featured in this set, she stayed on the longest going from air-headed valley girl to not-that-much of an air-headed valley girl. Compared to Kim (and I'm not bashing on the actresses who portrayed the characters); Trini served the purpose of translating Billy's geek talk in the first season (not so much the later half) and she was just generally nice. Though I'll admit she could kick butt when needed, faced more monsters alone than Kim and actual received more focus episodes than her (seriously she gets six focus episodes before Tommy shows up). Aisha really just served Trini's role of best friend to Kim and pretty much had her personality. Last is Kat, who gets to be the focus of pretty much every episode after she turns good other than the Master Vile 3 parter but after that nothing is really done with her except to become Tommy's girlfriend in Zeo. Plus, compared to pretty much every other character who left the show in these first few seasons, she actually gets an exiting story arc focused on her. Sure there was the backdrop of the Peace Conference in season 2 but due to reasons that pretty much every fan of the series knows, Jason and the others were barely featured outside of stock footage and bad dubbers (granted that's more than what Aisha, Billy, Tommy, Kat, Adam and Tanya got). I'll admit my favorite villains are Rita and Lord Zedd (though I'll be the first to admit they pale in comparison to pretty much every villain from Space, Trakeena, Ransik, Mesogog and others when it comes to character development and not being evil for the sake of being evil). I'll also go ahead and say that Zedd, despite becoming sillier due to parental complaints (thank goodness mine never did), was better off with Rita. He fell into the same rut she did and accomplished much more together. Which is why I never liked the Machine Empire, especially after rewatching Zeo. They boast of being this big, bad empire but never fulfill on that. Not once did they win any victory against the Rangers and it's really bad when Mondo's beaten twice by the Rangers and once by Rita and Zedd.

In terms of video and sound quality, it's great. I've read elsewhere that others say that it looks like a VHS transfer but since my VHS copies from the early '90s still look good after 20 years, I don't care. The special features are also great, particularly the retrospectives and the easter egg. The VHS exclusives I'm mixed on. Alpha's Magical Christmas is a travesty (I can't even make it past six minutes), Lord Zedd's Monster Heads and the Bulk and Skull feature was a cheap way to make money (though at least the Bulk and Skull one actually featured new footage) and seeing as how I never knew there was a live show until 2009, it was OK. Cheap and other than the Rangers suits, nothing was show accurate but it was OK.

If you're a fan of the show I think you should splurge and get it but if you're on a tight budget, the individual releases aren't that badly priced and season 2, vol. 2 comes out in May so the only real attraction for this is the special features.",1362355200,,6683,4.510726072607261

Well, I traded the first two sets in and bought this bad-boy and it is well worth the price.  The packaging alone is spectacular not to mention the duration of discs and the quality is as good as it could get.

5189903,5,B008XRE81E,"I start out with my genuine declaration of love for this show.  I've loved it for so very long; I watched it every day after school.  I never really got over the exits of the original cast and thus I never made it pass, or into, the future Turbo series or anything afterwards.

A collection like this has been long waited for by me.  Though I never forgot any of the story and could replay my favorite eps in my head, having the episodes of MMPR is always something I wanted.  This boxset was great for that...

It covers all of what was labeled as part of the long-running ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", my favorite Japanese show hack-job/rip-off.  It's classic, amusing, and still entertains this 29-yr-old female Power Ranger fangirl.  Now I can enjoy it for what it is: an American original adaption mutilating a Japanese show.. Ooohboy, that's tough for me to say, since I am an anime-fangirl as well and hate butchered anime.

And as someone who has seen a few episodes of Zyuranger (what Season 1 is ripped from), I can truly appreciate them as separate entities.  I love Power Rangers... and I love Zyuranger.  They may look similar, but Power Rangers has its charm for a children's show.  Its great for my nostalgia. :)

...I'm sure they did the best collecting masters for such an old show to at least give it to us lingering fans after all these years.  Any video quality discrepicies I have attributed to the using of stock footage from the Japanese shows.  And as for the company releasing this set: they did a great job with packaging...it s a great little set... and I am looking forwards to many of Shout's other releases of others 'lost' series.",1359072000,17,1663,4.570945945945946

Anyway, this was the season that started it all and you have to give it credit for that. I find it hard to explain why I love it so much; the acting is cheesy (at first), the plots are sometimes eye-roll worthy, the morals are less than subtle, and the monsters vary from amazing designs to ""what were they thinking?"" And for all that I love it. It somehow manages to make all that work for it and blend into something extraordinary.

The quality for this (keeping in mind half the scenes are grainy stock footage from Japan and that it was shot in the beginning of the nineties) is pretty amazing and the audio is just as good. I haven't heard such a clear ""It's morphin' time!"" in ages. So if you loved this show growing up, or enjoy the franchise's later years then I recommend this for you.

Only dislikes I had was last series of shows seemed to be pushed out a s fast as they could and made them kind of stale.  Seems to be the down fall of the seasons that followed.

That is why I decided to buy the box set and I could not ask for anything more. It comes with all 155 episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers/ Alien Rangers. All of the episodes are uncut so when you remember the dragonzord blowing up the building, it is still their and not edited out like the Netflix episodes. It also comes with two bonus disc.

There are voice actors that dubbed Jason, Trini, and Zack's parts. I bought a homemade collection of the show off ebay years ago.

Although I am still on Season One, and watching the Second Volume, even as I am doing this review, I am just glad to watch the Episodes that I have watched on TV, and the Episodes that I have NOT seen. It just feels so good to relive my 90's Childhood by watching this show all over again.

5189934,5,B008XRE81E,"1993. It was an intriguing time in the United States as we saw elements of Japanese pop culture starting to make its way to television. From Japanese animation being shown on television, so was a sentai series known as ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"".

Based on the 16th installment of the Super Sentai franchise and known as ""Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger"" in Japan, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" became an amazing hit as it aired on Fox Kids and made Saban Entertainment a household name for people growing up at that time. Instead of releasing the Japanese version of the series and providing an English dub, Saban Entertainment wrote new episodes and just used the footage featuring the action sequences including the rangers and their mecha vehicles incorporated to the new footage.

And with the 20th Anniversary of the Power Rangers in America taking place in 2013, Shout! Factory will be releasing the complete series via 19-DVD set of ""Mighty Morphon Power Rangers: The Complete Series"".  The ultimate set for fans of the original Power Rangers!

""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was a simple story focusing on five teenagers in the fictional city of Angel Grove, California.

The five teenagers, who are good friends, included the fitness jock Jason Lee Scott (as portrayed by Austin St. John), the dancer Zack Taylor (as portrayed by Walter Jones), the gymnast Kimberly Hart (As portrayed by Amy Jo Johnson), the intelligent Billy Cranston (as portrayed by David Yost) and the always happy Trini Kwan (as portrayed by Thuy Trang).

While the teens put hang out at a teen Youth Center owned by Ernie (As portrayed by Richard Genelle) and are often upset at the local wannabe bullies Bulk (as portrayed by Paul Schrier) and Skull (as portrayed by Jason Narvy), everyone likes to have fun at the center.

While in space, two astronauts discover an extraterrestrial container and when they open it, they inadvertently release the evil alien sorceress named Rita Repulsa who was confined in the container for over 10,000 years. And now Rita has her sights of conquering the planet Earth with her evil space aliens and monsters.

The wise sage known as Zordon, who was responsible for capturing Rita and confining her, now needs to make sure Earth is protected. So, Zodon has his robotic assistant named Alpha 5, find five teenagers who can help defend the Earth from Rita's attacks.

And the five teenagers are brought to headquarters to meet Zordon and Alpha 5 and find out that they have been selected to defend the Planet Earth from Rita Repulsa's attacks. They will be given the power of the Power Rangers, dino-powered warriors of goodness.

Jason becomes Red Ranger, Zack becomes Black Ranger, Billy becomes Blu Ranger, Trini becomes Yellow Ranger and Kimberly becomes Pink Ranger. The five are given weapons and a vehicle to control. And when their opponent becomes too strong for all five to challenge, the five can use their vehicles to become one huge robot known as the Megazord.

As the five teens use their new powers to defend the planet from Rita Repulsa's monsters, a new teenager with martial arts skills shows up in Angel Grove. His name is Tommy Oliver (portrayed by Jason David Frank), who has the power of the Green Ranger, but is he friend or foe?

As the first season focused on Rita trying to use the Tommy/green power ranger against the Power Rangers and then trying to regain the power, the second season would introduce new antagonists.

In season two, Rita Repulsa's superior, Lord Zedd has arrived and upset with her performance, he throws her into the space dumpster and focuses on his own personal campaign to conquer Earth.  But because of the new threat, Zordon and Alpha upgrade the Dinozords into the Thunderzords, with the exception of Tommy who must continue to use the Dragonzord.

Meanwhile, as Zedd ties to focus on eliminating Tommy, Zed creates a special green crystal in order to take away the powers of the Green Ranger and also power up Zedd's Dark Rangers.  Meanwhile, Jason, Zack and Trini are chosen to attend the World Peace Conference in Switzerland and that means that the Power Rangers will need new members.  And the three's powers are transferred over to new members Rocky DeSantos (portrayed by Steve Cardenas), the new red ranger; Adam Park (portrayed by Johnny Yong Bosch), the new black ranger and Aisha Campbell (portrayed by Karan Ashley); the new yellow ranger.

This will eventually lead to a new storyline featuring a transformation of Tommy into the White Ranger with a Tigerzord and become the new leader of the group.  As for Rita Repulsa, she makes her re-appearances, albeit with a special makeover to have a younger and prettier face.  Thus creating two power-house antagonists that the Rangers must contend with.

In season three, a new antagonist known as Rito Revolto (Rita's skeletal brother) has now arrived on Earth and showing his might, destroys the Power Rangers Thunderzords and even the Tiger Zord.  Needing new zords, the Power Rangers seek the creator of the Power Coins, Ninjor and the result is the creation of powerful Ninjazords and the Falconzord and later to the Shogunzords.

The third season introduces us to Katherine Hillard (portrayed by Catherine Sutherland) who arrives from Australia to Angel Grove and becomes the new replacement for Kimberly who chooses to pursue her dreams of competing in the Pan Global Games and becomes the new Pink Ranger.

The third season also, introduces us to Rita's father, Master vile and turns the Power Rangers into children and leads to the ten-episode mini-series (a.k.a. Season 3.5), Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers (which is included in the season three DVD release).

With Master Vile using the Orb of Doom to turn the Power Rangers into children, Zordon recruits the Alien Rangers of Aquitar for their help.  Meanwhile, Billy tries to find a way to restore everyone back to their normal ages and that is to find the fragments of the Zeo Crystal.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Complete Series"" is presented in 4:3 and this is probably the best quality we are going to see of the series. As many '90s shows (animated or live action) will not receive the HD remastering or cleanup (especially due to the costs involved in remastering and clean up), having owned the VHS copies including the old Matrix Interactive Xiphias multimedia CD of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", this is probably the best quality that I have seen of the series so far.

But with that being said, the series does look soft, it does feature noise and occasional specks do show up here and there. It's important to note that the series was low budget in the beginning, it combined Japanese footage with American-made footage, so the sources do differ at times. But back then, Saban made it work! And as the series progresses, the picture quality does get a bit better.

As expected on DVD, with ten episodes on a single DVD, you can expect mild artifacts and banding. But for those who recorded the series on VHS or bought the original VHS or low-res Quicktime multimedia CD like I did back then, this is probably the best looking version of the TV series on any media right now.

As for audio, the audio is actually quite clear via Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0. Dialogue and music is clear and I heard no audio problems during my viewing of the entire series.

There are no English subtitles but closed captions are included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Back in 1993, I was a big fan of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"".

At the time, I was running a Japanese animation and pop culture BBS and I remember myself and a group of other adult friends just being happy because we were starting to see Japanese pop culture, may it be anime or sentai (Japanese term for ""squadron"" but most often used for Ranger-type shows) on American television.

As a big fan of the anime series ""Gatchaman"" (also known as ""G-Force"" or ""Battle of Planets"" in the U.S.), I had this interest in sentai series. Mainly because I thought martial arts and the uniforms were cool, typically there was always a pretty starlet playing a member of the series and just enjoyed the series no matter how corny the storyline or adversaries would be or how the Yellow Ranger (Japanese scenes taken from Zyuranger) in action was played by a guy, while the America's Yellow Ranger was a female.

My personal favorite in Japan was ""Ninja Sentai Kakurangers"" and also ""Chojin Sentai Jetman"", but when I found out that Kyoryuu Sentai Zyuranger (Dinosaur Task Force Zyuranger) was coming to America with the name ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", suffice to say, I was excited to see how its American interpretation would be. Especially how it would utilize the Japanese scenes.

And at the time, I can easily remember guys go crazy over Amy Jo Johnson, people wanting to design and have a Power Rangers helmet or costume and saw the excitement with the addition of the Green Ranger/White Ranger Tommy Oliver.

But as the series became popular, I can easily remember news stories of parents of different countries complaining about the violence of the series and children using martial arts on their siblings or other kids. Parents going crazy with the introduction of Lord Zedd and automatically seeing a new person playing Rita Repulsa.

But possibly the biggest shock would be the contract disputes in season two involving Austin St. John, Thuy Trang and Walter Jones and Saban making their statement clear that any cast member can easily be replaced. And by mid-season, three new cast members appeared in the series.

So, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was an intriguing part of early '90s pop culture. Many people were captivated by the show and even today, many young people including dedicated fans who have been around since 1993, continue to follow the series.

And because this series was so brand new and introduced people to sentai to larger audience, the original series holds a strong place in the hearts of many sentai fans!  And the fact that I grew up with this series, suffice to say, I have nothing but positive memories of watching the shows with friends and back during those earlier years of being online via BBS or when the internet started to become used in the household, this is one series that I will always remember chatting with people while it was airing on television.  Those were the days!

So, here we are with the fantastic DVD release of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season - The Complete Series"". Over 155-videos on 19 DVD's. And watching these episodes takes me back to 1993, because I can remember chatting with people about these episodes, reading messages from the Amy Jo Johnson fans but seeing how people were really getting into the series by episode 17. The Green Ranger arc known as ""Green with Evil"" was so popular that many people would chime in on these episodes and what they thought of new character Tommy Oliver.

I can easily remember when Tommy became the White Ranger and then of course the baton was passed from the first cast to three new members and eventually seeing the Thunderzords, then the Ninja zords and seeing goodbye to Kimberly and Katherine replacing her as the new Pink Ranger.  So, many memories!

Watching it today, sure the series can be a bit corny. With the monsters ala rubber suits, a Black character as Black Ranger and an Asian as Yellow Ranger is a bit stereotypical and seeing the early '90s fashion definitely makes this series a product of its time. And I'm sure a lot of us had jokes of seeing a Yellow Ranger with an adam's apple back then and even to my chagrin of seeing Saban Entertainment doing the 3.5 series featuring the Power Rangers turned to children.  How delighted I was that the series did not turn out to be like ""Big Bad Beetleborgs"".

But these episodes were fun to watch again and like any fan who is nostalgic for the series, it's great to have this DVD set, especially containing  all these episodes for a pretty wonderful price! I can remember paying a lot more for the VHS tape including the multimedia disc that had the bad quality, small low-res Quicktime videos at the time. The old multimedia discs were so bad that colors were faded, artifacts galore and they were split up into multiple media files.

So, it's great to have this all three seasons on DVD. And like many '80s or early '90s shows, they are not going to be the greatest in clarity. Picture quality is slightly soft, there are white specks that can be seen as with noise and yes, there is a little interlacing and artifacts that are expected on DVD (note: Mostly noticeable when watching it on big screens but not on smaller televisions) but considering the alternatives out there of watching this series on physical media, this is probably the best looking version you're going to get for this first season and the good news is that as the series progresses, picture quality does get better.

But all first three seasons and season 3.5 together in one set is fantastic!  And also the inclusion of the special features, quite a few that are new and some of the old features that were on the VHS tapes are included on this DVD set.  While it would have been nice to have one of the convention press conferences being included on the special features or even a cast audio commentary reuniting some of the original members, I am quite pleased that there are newer interviews included with this DVD release but it would be great to have commentary, press conference and also the original pilot, which I was hoping to be included with this DVD set.

But fortunately, fans who want to know more about the Power Rangers that aren't featured in the special features can still catch the cast at various conventions.  Fortunately original talents such as Austin St. John, Walter Jones, David Yost, Jason David Frank, Paul Schrier, Jason Narvy and Rita Repulsa voice actress, Barbara Gordon, are still very active in the convention scene and enjoy meeting with fans of the series but unfortunately a true reunion with all six original members together would be impossible due to the unfortunate death of actress Thuy Trang (Trini/Yellow Ranger), who died in a car accident in 2001.

But there was something magical about this cast.  They were newbies but for us who grew up with them, I think it was positive in the sense that the casting was diverse.  I was also proud of the series back then because it featured a Black and Asian hero. Not sure if Saban was trying to be multi-cultural or politically correct but for me, how proud I was to see the casting of Walter Jones and Thuy Trang. As an Asian American, you just don't see Asian heroes (outside of martial arts films distributed in America at the time), for me, to have a strong character like Trini, I was grateful for that. And of course, it continued with the newer members with Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Cardenas and Karan Ashley.  And I'm glad that to this day, people of different ethnicities are still featured in these character roles for the different Power Rangers series within the last 20 years.  I find that pretty awesome!

But nevertheless, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" was a big part of the lives of many children and young adults. I was one of those fans who enjoyed it back then and met many good friends who were fans of the series and as I got older, eventually having friends who were involved in various Power Rangers series, may it be as talent or on the technical end of the series.

Overall, for those who grew up with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, this is the ultimate set! ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Complete Series"" features all three seasons plus the season 3.5 mini-series, new and older special features and more!  What an awesome set that fans will definitely want to own.  Highly recommended!",1354233600,30,17673,4.804225817101353
5189935,5,B008XRE81E,I purchased this product at New York Comicon. Any MMPR fan should purchase this. It is a complete set of all the MMPR episodes. Each case on the spine features each Power Ranger. The packaging is much better than most collections. The quality of the video is great (considering it's a 90's TV show).,1354147200,4,299,4.555555555555555
5189936,4,B008XRE81E,"I just recently received my copy in the mail. I am definitely excited to sit down and watch it. The artwork and design of the packaging is superb, and the quality of the episodes seems reasonable.
However...I live in Australia, where the region is PAL. This DVD is coded for NTSC. Normally this doesn't worry me. I've been able to watch NTSC DVDs before and so I didn't hesitate to purchase this set. When I tried it on the same DVD player I've always used, one that is supposedly PAL/NTSC, it wouldn't work. It wouldn't play on my PS3 or XBox 360 which have worked for some DVDs previously. It did however work on a cheap DVD player we have in the lounge. So while this is a good quality and value box set of, what is for many, a cherished childhood TV show; be aware that if you purchase it from outside of the US/Canada, you might be disappointed to find it won't play.",1354060800,3,872,4.290909090909091
5189937,3,B008XRE81E,"Shout put a lot of effort into this boxed set.  The booklet is really nice, and the extras DVD is great.  Everything looks really nice, so... it's too bad the episodes aren't better quality!

Some of the shots are perfect, and then it cuts to the next one and it's really grainy.  I was hoping all the episodes would be in great shape, but many are not, and I don't believe it's from age.  My VHS copies of these shows is better than the picture on many of the episodes!  I particularly noticed ""Crystal of Nightmares"", one of my favorites, is grainy nearly all the way through.  My VHS recording that's nearly 20 years old looks better.

In an interview with producer Brian Ward before the set was released, a concern over the quality of the episodes was addressed since there are so many on each disc.  He talked about bitrate and how it would be pretty much exactly how it aired on Fox Kids originally.  Too bad it's not.

Still, it's a nice way to get all the episodes of Mighty Morphin' in one shot, and they're convenient to watch.",1353888000,6,1037,4.37696335078534
5189938,5,B008XRE81E,This series of for all ages children through adults.  I really liked this program when I was young and like my son to see it.  This is the beginning of the Power Ranger series and shows how ordinary people can make a difference in the world to make it a better place from evil and even the the bad elements that are in the world.  This show gives hope that we can change our world if we only give of ourselves by putting other people first and taking care of the environment and nature.  I really like the message that is brought to light that no matter what happens there is always hope as long as people believe there is and hope is the best weapon to defeat evil and win.  The characters really bring out the true meaning of life to live the best we can in the world and do what we can to change things for the better.,1353801600,3,821,4.074534161490683

I LOVED the MMPR but there were so many episodes I didn't get to see when this show originally aired!  MMPR is one of those shows that never gets old and, although corny is WAY better than kids shows currently on the air.  This is an awesome way to relive my favorite moments of this show and see the entire show!  The quality is a bit grainy and in full screen but otherwise good quality.",1353628800,2,470,4.131868131868132
5189940,4,B008XRE81E,"I got the complete set from time life of seasons 1-9. Just started watching season 1 today, on disc two as of right now.

The audio is great and its fun to watch again. My only issue is the video is quite grainy. Couple people have told me its because im watching it on a 60"" LED tv, but when i watched a webripped episode, it wasn't as grainy. Im assuming that it is becuase they put 10 episodes on each disc and had to lower the quality which is disappointing. I would have paid more money for a better quality set if they had done 5disc per season instead of 3. Hopefully we will get bluray releases at some point like they just started releasing in japan.

If your a fan of the show and don't mind a grainy picture if you have a large tv, i say go for it. Otherwise, maybe wait till they start releasing full season sets wiht more disc and less episodes per disc.",1350518400,2,867,4.094117647058823
5189941,5,B008XRE81E,"Finally the complete first season is out on dvd and for purchase too! I heard it's on Netflix, but for someone who doesn't want to spend $9 a month just to watch one tv show, I'd much rather have it as a collector's item instead. I grew up with the Power Rangers. I remember when it first came out too. I was about 8, 9 years old. It caught my attention almost instantly even before it came out! I've watched the later seasons as well, but none of them are as great as the original power rangers. I admit Dino Thunder was pretty awesome only because Tommy came back as the black ranger, but other than that, none of the other seasons kept my attention span for more than a couple episodes.
But I'm glad they decided to release the first season on dvd. Can't wait for the other box sets! The price is pretty reasonable as well, given it's the COMPLETE set.",1350432000,4,855,4.251533742331288

8532260,5,B008XRE81E,"One of the defining shows in my childhood (basically most of the Fox Kids lineup including ""Batman"" and ""Animaniacs""), ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" is a nostalgic favorite of mine. Looking back on some episodes, the series has not aged well (like the Bulk and Skull hijinks in the first two seasons), but for those whom the series hit a sweet spot long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a gleam in Kevin Feige's eye -- there's that irresistible urge to pull out your Power Morpher, yell ""It's Morphin Time!"" and take on the bad guys. As the show increased in popularity, it went through tumultuous patches (like half the cast leaving in season 2) and the producers having to use different sentai footage while keeping the Zyuranger suits in seasons 2 and 3. But there's a light and campy charm to the series, and the cast members had fantastic chemistry. There's just nothing like the original... period.

I never dreamed that a kids' show like this would receive the 5-star treatment, let alone from Shout Factory, ten years ago. But now, thanks to original franchise creator Haim Saban (who bought the franchise back from Disney) and Brian Ward, it has come to light. While it would be great if the series had been completely remastered and with a 5.1 remix, the a.v. presentation is fine for a mid-90s television show, with acceptable video and audio quality. The quality is hampered by 8-10 episodes on each disc, which results in minor compression issues. But considering the show's age and budget, it never looked the best anyway. Each episode is divided into several chapters, with cool animated menus and play all options. Not only that, but all episodes AND video bonus content have English close-captions... nice touch Saban!

What really makes the set worthwhile is the bonus content. You get interviews with cast and crew members, which are thoroughly comprehensive, but also interviews with Power Ranger fans themselves. And you also get several specials that were originally on videotape, like ""Alpha's Magical Christmas"" and ""The White Ranger Kata."" There's also a nice 39-page booklet detailing the characters and episode listings. It's an embarrassment of riches.

The difference between this and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers-The-Complete-Series/dp/B008XRE81E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;is just packaging -- the disc contents and booklet are the same. The first two seasons each are packaged in single Amaray cases (not divided into two volumes apiece), while ""Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers"" gets its own case next to the third season. It's less bulky than the 2012 release and packed into an equally beautiful slipcase, with front artwork by Paul Shipper. And for a lower price, you can't beat it.

A must-own for every Power Ranger fan.",1523836800,,2897,5.36043956043956
