8092677,1,B000BTQH02,WOW. DO NOT order this dvd!  The quality is so poor it truly should not be sold. It looks like someone recorded it on their phone from an old tv. Very. Bad.,1461888000,2,156,3.875
8092678,1,B000BTQH02,"This was a HUGE disappointment. It is NOT re-mastered version of the 1951 film. The first two discs are audio compact discs of the opera. The third looks like a pirated copy of the 1951 film.  The colors are COMPLETLY washed out and not the vibrant ones of the original or re-mastered copies. DON'T waste your money on the piece of s%$t.  The folks at Amazon completely dropped the ball on this one.  It shouldn't have been listed in the ""movie"" section for starters...maybe under ""rip-off"" would have been a better choice.",1437782400,5,523,4.663043478260869
8092679,5,B000BTQH02,Outstanding color photography and beautiful sets.  Singing was excellent and superb dancing.  Makeup was highly creative.  Especial performances by Robert Helpman in his four roles and Moira Shearer's dancing.  Highly recommended program.,1435881600,,238,6.34375

8092682,3,B000BTQH02,"I saw this film when I was a child, it was the first opera I had seen, and fell in love with the opera.  So when I had the opportunity to buy a DVD I did.  However the quality of the DVD is awful, it looks like it was photographed from a TV screen with all the lines the old CRTs gave. The DVD came with two CDs of a German language production, I guess the German language dubbing for the film.  These are fine, after all, operas used to be performed in the local language of every country they were produced in.

So I'm glad to have it for personal historical reasons but can not recommend it if you expect normal visual quality.",1431129600,7,630,4.056451612903226

8092684,5,B000BTQH02,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's film TALES OF HOFFMANN (1951) is not entirely faithful to Jacques Offenbach's original opera, but it is a wonderful work of art in its own right. It was conceived as a ""vehicle"" for ballerina Moira Shearer, who had previously starred in their film THE RED SHOES (1948), and special non-Offenbach music was added to showcase her abilities even more. Further, this film is far more balletic than Offenbach's opera, and approximately four-fifths of the parts are played by ballet dancers, whose vocal parts have been dubbed by a large array of unseen operatic singers.

The restored 127-minute original version contains a commentary track, which includes comments by film director Martin Scorsese; he rightly points out that this film's camera work is also extremely balletic and that even the eye movements of the main characters have been choreographed to fit the tempos of the music. (Scorsese adds that he adapted this idea when making his own film TAXI DRIVER [1976].)

Essentially the ""plot"" of the work is a surreal, Cocteau-like tale of a man who has had three unhappy experiences with love in his past ... and who is, in the present (unknown by himself), having a fourth woman's love for him sabotaged by another man. The sequence of this work (which is rather difficult to follow during the first viewing) is (1) a Prologue (set in the ""present""), (2) ""The Tale of Olympia"" (set in the past), (3) ""The Tale of Giulietta"" (set in the past), (4) ""The Tale of Antonia"" (set in the past, and in this adaptation moved from a German city to a Greek island), and (5) an Epilogue (set again in the ""present"").

Hoffmann is played by Robert Rounseville, who does his own singing. Moira Shearer (whose songs are dubbed) plays two of his ladyloves (Stella in the Prologue and Epilogue and Olympia in the first tale); Giulietta is played by Ludmilla Tcherina (whose songs are also dubbed); Antonia is played by Ann Ayars, who does her own singing. Noteworthy for facial expressions and eye movements is Pamela Brown, who plays Hoffmann's close companion Nicklaus (whose songs are also dubbed).

The final two minutes of this film provide viewers/listeners with a surprise ending that's very interesting and amusing. All things considered, I would give this production a solid ""A"" grade ... and I would strongly recommend that others do what I did: watch this film at least twice in the same day, in order to appreciate and comprehend what is going on and how it is being presented in a highly stylized manner.",1424649600,8,2544,4.881944444444445
