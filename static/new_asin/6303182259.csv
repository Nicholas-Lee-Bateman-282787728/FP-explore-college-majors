She also tells you what to do if you get too tired and how not to overstrain your muscles. I recommend this workout video to anyone, beginners as well as advancers because you will not be sorry with this one.",999216000,,306,4.203389830508475
7840547,5,6303182259,I've always liked this work out.  I ordered this one to replace a previous one.,1420416000,,79,4.266666666666667
7840548,5,6303182259,"Of all of the tapes Tamilee has produced, I feel this is definitely her best tape. I use this tape 6 days a week.  It's her best well rounded exercise video.  I do wish she had more tapes, I had to reorder this tape do to the fact that the one I had started to have places that were color was affected, guess I just wore the tape out.
I'm talking about her Buns of Steel 4 - Advanced.",1324684800,,384,3.848101265822785
7840549,5,6303182259,"That's what a local female trainer at my gym calls this Tamilee tape...and she is right! I bought this tape based on her suggestion. Its 40 minutes of focused exercise without letting up much. Tamilee pulls out all the stops on this one & gets you what you want. The first section is standing with lots of lunges & squats. The second section is on the floor (you will want a mat) isometrics & pulsing will get even the most in shape burnin'. I like Tamilee's instruction & no nonsense style. She lets you know how many more reps & which leg etc. without being annoying.
I have been working out to older Tamilee video's for years & this one is def. advanced. I started out trying 10 lb. dumbells on 1st segment & ankle weights on 2nd. I quickly put them down for the first few times & went to 5 Lb. dumbells later. If you are looking for an advanced bun workout - look no further - add whatever dumbells & ankle weights you can manage as you go. Pay attention to your form, do the exercises exactly as she does them. I found this does wonders to maximize results!
This workout has taken my buns to a new level! I take a rest between the sections & only do ankle weights on section 2. If you can manage ankle weights through both sections - you will DEF. feel it later...plus you must be from the planet Krypton!! By using dumbells on section 1 you will also get a good arm workout. I don't recommend starting with weights unless you are pretty strong to begin with. Plus Tamilee moves quickly through the reps so start light & see how you do. I got rid of other instructor tapes after I got this one. No others that I've done (which are many) give results like this one. Period.",1271376000,,1677,4.260188087774295
7840550,4,6303182259,"This is a really good workout, but nothing special or even unique about it. Results is all that matters, but if you have other muscle toning workouts like Kathy Smith or Joanie Greggains, then you needn't bother with Webb's workouts. But I do recommend Webb's: ""Buns of Steel Step Aerobics"". Her step routine has good step workout music, and it's nicely strenuous because it's a 40 minute step workout. No abs, just stepping. The moves are easy to do, and your legs will take a beating. Go for the step workout, skip this one if you have other stuff to workout with.",1249776000,,566,4.5588235294117645
7840551,4,6303182259,"yes i went buns of steel crazy...and honestly everything of steel crazy.  if you plan on doing the same i wouldnt reccomend it.  they are all very simular.  but i loved the original buns of steel- it was a hoot!  i could barely do the exercise from laughing at gregory's comments.  still that one was the best in terms of workouts, tamilees are kind of short...still wouldnt be a bad purchase to have an abs, buns and arms of steel.",1227225600,2,432,4.35
7840552,5,6303182259,"I bought this video a couple months ago and after the first time I did it, I couldn't sit down for three days. Although you feel the moves when you're doing them, you really don't have any idea how much MORE you'll feel it the next day. I needed something to get rid of the jello on my rear, and boy did I find what I was looking for! Weekly, I alternate this intense 40 minute session with two other 15 minute butt sessions from Tamilee's ""I Want That Body"" DVD, which gives me three good bun workouts a week. In just about a month, I have already seen and felt an amazing difference in my rear-- even my husband has started commenting on the results!

Now I won't buy anything but Tamilee's videos because I know I will get the most bang for my buck. Everything else after this Buns of Steel video just seems to easy.",1185667200,3,819,4.1835443037974684
7840553,5,6303182259,I love this tape. I am a relatively dedicated runner and I love a good leg workout. This tape is super effective and a very efficient workout:) I always feel the burn the next day which for me is what it's all about. Definitely advanced!!,1176336000,,238,4.311111111111111
7840554,4,6303182259,"This 40 minute workout is led by Tamilee Webb, who has led most of the ""Steel"" workouts.  This one is super advanced for buns and lower body.  Half of the routine is done standing and the other half on the floor.  Equipment that is used in this workout are a step or box, light dumbells (1-5lb) and a mat if you do not have carpet.  Of course if you do not have a step you can still do the moves without it.

You start with a brief warmup and move right into the standing work.  You pick up your weights and start with forward lunges on the step, first you will alternate legs while doing side lateral raises, then you will lunge on the right leg only while adding bicep curls, then you go back to alternation, then you work the left leg only, then back to alternation one last time.  Then you will work the right leg again, but this time you will be in static lunge position and do tiny pulses, you will do the same on the left leg with another set of alternating lunges in between.  All of these lunges are done onto the step.  Next you will stand on top of the step and repeat the entire sequence but doing back (reverse) lunges this time.  This time you do front shoulder raises along with the lunges.  Tamilee is good at reminding you of form pointers and to take out the arms if you get tired and politely tells you that you can smile while you workout and that she is feeling it too.

After all those lunges, you will move into one legged squats, first starting on the left leg.  You will start with a slower count (2-2) then go to tempo, then you will hold for an isometric contraction then do tiny pulses.  Then you repeat this on the right leg.  To complete the standing work you will do lateral squats, no weights are used for this segment.  You will place on leg on the step, squat and pulse for 8 counts then move over to the other side, repeating a few times, then you will do the same but in 4 counts to finish out.

The last half of the workout is done on the floor starting with pelvic tilts with one leg on the step, heels down and toes up in the air, the other leg raised up in the air.  Your weights go on your hips and you will raise up for 2 counts then tempo.  Then you will do some brief oblique work, then repeat on the other side.  Next you will do more pelvic tilts but with both heels on the step, again you will start with a 2-2 count, then move to tempo while adding inner thigh squeezes.  Then it's time for inner thigh lifts, weights are placed on the working leg and you do lifts with various tempos.  The nonworking leg is placed on the step, of course it can be done without the step.  You repeat this on the other leg.  Finally you do some ab work, traditional crunches with varying tempo holds, then you will do lower abs with some pelvic tilts/crunches, then you combine the two together.

If you like high reps and low weight this would be a good choice.  The reps seem endless here, mainly for the standing portion of the workout though it's only 20 minutes.  Tamilee does a good job instructing and emphasizing good form and technique, plus she is very pleasant.  She is exercising alone and in the same setting as all of the ""Steel"" videos.  The music is okay, it's all keyboard music similar sounding to some of the other videos.  Cheaper budget aside, this one will get you on your way to Buns of Steel.",1131321600,18,3347,4.200626959247649
7840555,5,6303182259,"Once again, Tamilee Webb instructs another great exercise video!!! This is a toning video that is done on an aerobic step. Lots of squats and lunges. Too easy??? Pick up some weights and start sweating!!! It has a couple of minutes of ab work, and who doesn't need that? With the weights, this is a very challenging and invigorating workout.",1001030400,4,341,4.7
