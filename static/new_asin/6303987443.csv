777771,3,6303987443,"This is an odd little curio; a bizarre fantasy film meant to follow in the footsteps of The Treasure of Sierra Madre.  Yes, GREED is its sole theme.  Okay, there's also a lost civilization but given the number of people that keep washing up on its shores how lost could they be?  What distinguishes these people from the locals are their HUGE oogly-boogly eyes, supposedly pearlized.  Naturally, they are never seen in close-ups only on the periphery.
The plot revolves around a group of people who want pearls anyway they can get them, plus a woman who wants to ""study"" the natives.  The so-called natives have designs of their own involving diver Vic (Patrick Wayne) and a way of keeping their people from dying out due to excessive inbreeding.  Yes, this is a PG family film, upon the insistence of its star Patrick Wayne.  It did not, as expected, become a hit.  I blame it on all the underwater ballet footage, a slow pace, and not much in the way of intrigue.  The dubious stars of this production are John Wayne's son Patrick, Sid Haig (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects), and John Ashley (Beach Party, Beach Blanket Bingo).  Ashley also served as the producer of this film.

This isn't the greatest adventure film ever made but it's not the worst.  Its main crime is its banality.  It's nothing I'd ever care to watch again so it's definitely not a keeper.",1366156800,2,1373,4.62396694214876
777772,3,6303987443,"Not a boring show just simple and fast, very much sy-fy channel material. The underwater footage takes the cake, there are few movies with that quality. Plus Patrick Wayne is pretty cool actor I think.",1360713600,2,201,4.771428571428571
777773,5,6303987443,"Possibly one of the sillier Fillipino exploitation movies of the 70s, a race of fish people (Atlantians?) use their king's beautiful daughter, Siren, to lure fishermen in with her beauty and pearls in order to mate with them and preserve their race. Pearl hunters, looking for quick riches, encounter the strange islanders and chaos ensues. Originally meant for children, Edie Romero's Beyond Atlantis is definitely not a children's film, though it is lacking in the nudity of other Fillipino movies of the time. Starring John Ashley, Sid Haig, and Vic Diaz - this is a must see movie for Edie Romero, Filipino exploitation, and Sid Haig fans.",1337558400,8,643,5.018691588785047
777774,5,6303987443,"This is a decent movie. Hollywood has had a fascination with Atlantis like everyone else. This flick is no different. For it's time it's well made. Director Eddie Romero gets a couple of nice shots and without the use of special effects manages to add in nice cinematography.

The acting on the cast on this decent if not good. Essentially this is a ""don't mess with us"" type of allegory with the people of Atlantis vs. The Outside World (in this case in the form of greedy and murderous treasure hunters). The people of Atlantis are dead serious about protecting their homeland. Leigh Christian who plays Syrene, the lead Atlantian who is looking for love is very good in her role.

Unlike her people, she wants contact with the outside world and is very naive towards the words of men. Then the people of Atlantis are somewhat stern in their ways even forcing her to mate with her own kind. However, after you look at the men in this movie it's not hard to see why they are all scumbags here.

It's essentially like I said an allegory and there is more acting than action for the large bulk of the film till the exciting finale. Still ""Beyond Atlantis"" is worth tracking down.",1194652800,13,1178,4.52112676056338

lots of underwater scenes earns this 1 star, due to nobody being able to do any acting. there is a reason this was made in asia. they are not aware of how bad the acting is.
patrick wayne has not been in anything this bad since...
