5683401,5,B00C0YUY4Q,WOW we had to wait so long for the first season then BAM here comes the second season right after it...My kids are so pumped!!!!!!!!,1365379200,5,132,4.32
5683402,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"The first season of MLP was a surprise success, in that it found an audience that was not the demographic it was looking for. This was largely because the first season had a certain charm to it, and the stories were fun and for all ages. Season two continued upon this and arguably did a better job. Maybe I'm just partial to this season because this was the year that I got hooked on the show, but I have to say, the character growth (yeah, it's here) that the series featured during this season is awesome. Plus, as a Rainbow Dash fan, there are some really, really great episodes that showcase what a wonderful pony she became (""Read It And Weep"" is my favorite). Pretty much all of the ponies gained depth to their character, which is a great thing. While I think season 3 was pretty great, it had some issues that were not present in season 2, leading me to think this is the best season.",1364774400,6,893,4.321428571428571
5683403,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"After season 1 of Friendship is Magic ended up being an unexpected hit, it was pretty much inevitable that more would be produced, and needless to say the showmakers really outdid themselves.  Season 2 is a worthy follow-up to the season 1, and includes all the great writing, acting, music, and animation that made the first season so popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-can-find-my-review-of-that-season-here/dp/B0096W47NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You can find my review of that season here</a>.  While it's impossible to say whether it's better than the first season, season 2 definitely shows that the writers and animators are really stretching themselves. There's a bit more experimentation in how the episodes are written, and it's slightly more over-the-top in places, without ever losing the subtlety and nuance that sets this show apart from most childrens' programming.  That isn't to say that it doesn't have a few rough spots, there are a few episodes that could have used some additional tweaking before being aired, but even in those cases they're still very watchable.  None of the episodes are truly bad, they just aren't all exceptional.  As a whole, though, the second season is every bit as good as the first one, if not better.

A few of my personal highlights:

- The season premiere has one of the most well-written villains in the entire show, voiced by none other than John DeLancie of Star Trek:TNG fame.
- An episode which brilliantly parodies the ""we have to have a moral at the end of the episode"" formula used by the show in season 1.
- Fan favorite Princess Luna gets her own episode.
- The Cutie Mark Crusaders getting some much needed development outside of their group
- A Time Travel episode
- A murder mystery parody
- A finale that actually has some surprisingly clever twists, and turns out to be several times as epic as it appears at first glance.

There are plenty of other things I could list here, but that's a good enough sampling.

**Note: Obviously I don't have the DVD yet; once I actually get it I'll amend the review to account for the quality of the physical media**",1364601600,5,2169,5.087323943661972
5683404,4,B00C0YUY4Q,"It was, wasn't it?

Season 2 will always mean something to me since it's the season I got into the show and it should mean something to us bronies since it was the time the show began nodding towards the fandom, since Season 1 was mostly already in place, save for a few Derpy Hooves edits. It was a long season too, with 26 episodes that spanned from Sept of 2011 all the way up into the Royal Wedding that took place the end of Apr 2012. I'm sure this DVD will be a good convenient way for my other brony friends to relive all the excite S2 was at meetups.

Let's not forget some great moments (extremely abridged I should add): Discord (I'm howling at the moon?) broke free and was set back in stone a bit over a year ago, we were finally given a second appearance of Luna with all the Nightmare Night fun, we learned a bit about the history or Equestria in Hearts Warming Eve, Derpy spoke in The Last Roundup (and all the hoopla it caused on the web afterward), reading Rainbow Dash, Daring Do, Pinkie Pie's ""Smile Smile Smile!"", Fluttershy asserting herself, Metal Gear Twilight Sparkle from the future, teenage dragons, Shining Armor, and the Royal Canterlot Wedding.

I don't even have to explain too much about the two episode finale, they could have been a movie themselves.

You all get it. Support the show, grab the DVD, and maybe we'll break the AMZN best sellers like last time when the S1 DVD came out. And don't forget to hold on to your wallets for the Season 3 DVD.",1364342400,26,1483,4.36231884057971

5683406,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"Finally, here it is! Many of us had to wait years in order for the initial season to come out, but, thanks to the warm reasponse from the fan community, only a few months later, the second season is already available for purchase! Make sure to support Shout Factories and ensure the continuation of these awesome releases! Hopefully, a blu-ray release is in order. :D",1364169600,10,367,4.661538461538462
5683407,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"This is a review for MLP FIM: Season 2.

As a member of a family of Pony fans, I won't try to rate season 2 vs. the others.  Instead, I am just going to focus on the quality of the DVD.  So many times I have purchased DVD's and they are scratched or have some permanent flaw that makes them unwatchable.  Not this product.  My daughter has been running a pony marathon ever since she got this product (about four days), and it hasn't even skipped.  She also has what is called 'gooey kid finger' syndrome, so even with miscellaneous kid goo on the DVD, it still hasn't skipped.

I would recommend this product in terms of quality.  Its about 20% cooler.",1500336000,,653,4.295081967213115

For the most part, the series teaches all sorts of valuable lessons on Friendship and Character. The only downside, is that my kids have picked up a couple phrases or terms that we are not so impressed with. Like, ""Oh pooh!"" One pony uses this and now we have a hard time getting them to stop.

5683485,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"Being a big MLP fan, it was awesome that we were finally getting the complete seasons on DVD.  And from what I've seen, in general, it seems most fans consider this the best season of them all so far. Me, personally, I can't choose; all the seasons contained memorable episodes!  XD

This time around, this is the season that gave us the villain, Discord (played by TNG fan favorite, John DeLancie), the return of Princess Luna, Twilight's brother, Shining Armor (and the most epic wedding ceremony of all time); a rehash of the daily friendship reports to Princess Celestia (this time, the entire Mane 6 gives the reports, instead of just Twilight), and a speaking role for background pony turned fan-favorite, Derpy Hooves (or Ditzy Doo, depending on who you ask).

Which, speaking of Derpy, due to an infamous controversy in regards to her portrayal, her scenes in the episode, ""The Last Roundup"", were re-recorded for subsequent airings of the episode on TV.  The re-dub is the version you get on this DVD set.  However, you can hear the original audio from the first airing if you just do a YouTube search. If you also get the DVD, ""The Friendship Express"", that disc includes the original airing/voice for Derpy (for those of you who preferred the original voice).

Just like the first Season set, there isn't many special features.  However, the picture quality is excellent.  A cut and dry, but still nice set for the MLP fan.  Contains all the episodes from the Second season.",1429488000,,1485,4.788235294117647

Probably better than the first, considering now the writers and the creator had the time to determine exactly why kind of series this was going to be.
Great great season, with only two episodes I didn't much care for, that is packed with nice character development, some action, and probably the greatest season finale of any show in existence.
Like I've said about the other sets, but can't praise enough, but the disc art is still great and the inside box art is AMAZING with the entire cast of characters in a shot for the back. It's great, even throwing in the few characters from The Big Lebowski. XD",1420070400,,758,4.460431654676259

Anyway, this Season is considered one of the better ones of Friendship is Magic, and it's not hard to see why...

It had some of the BEST episodes, such as Return of Harmony, Lesson Zero, Sisterhooves Social, Read It and Weep, Hurricane Fluttershy, A Canterlot Wedding, and probably a few more I'm forgetting...

However, there are a few episodes that I... didn't really like that much... Such as Dragon Quest, Putting Your Hoof Down, The Mysterious Mare Do Well, and Hearts and Hooves Day (though I kinda LIKED Ponyville Confidential).

If you think its annoying, watch it another time; you're gonna love it.
If you think its stupid, your heart and mind is probably as hard as diamond, no offense, but later, you're gonna love it.

5683557,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"The second season of FiM really solidified the franchise in my mind as great. Well written story and dialog combined with amazing voice and visual talent are the heart of this amazing cartoon. While season 2 saw the gradual loss of show creator Lauren Faust (Iron Giant, Powerpuff Girls, Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends among many others) Jayson Theissen and the other project heads have done an amazing job picking up the torch and running with it. Some of the episodes madway in the season feel rushed and oddly paced, the overall season is still great. The season ends on a two part royal wedding which I thought I wasn't going to enjoy being an adult (not that I would hold that against a kids show) but was one of the best stories told in the whole series packed with action, excitement, and indeed romance (also a military invasion).

My only complaint about this volume is that the special features are uninteresting. Where the Season 1 collection had commentary on major episodes with writers, animators, the musical team, and voice talent; Season 2 features a mediocre quality recording of the 2012 SDCC My Little Pony panel, which can be seen on youtube for free.

I never expected that one of Star Trek's greatest characters would be in this show as a villain and Discord struck the right chords.  Granted, there are less letters to the Princess as to break the tradition of what was prominent in Season one.  However, it does not break the pace and feel of the show.  Season two's first two parter episode contains one of the best lessons that Twilight Sparkle had to learn throughout her studies and it does ring true in real life.

She is engrossed (we are not tv people) but I let her watch this as much as she likes because of the lessons it teaches.

We run all of Season One, then all of Season Two, and back all over again (will need to get our hands on the 3rd season asap!). We also have the book The Elements of Harmony, The Official Guidebook (which you really need if you love this show). We love the songs, the lessons, and all-in-all, it is a perfect package. Very suitable for her age at the moment, and I'm sure for the years to come. Definitely worth the money (and certainly better than the pain of re-watching limited copies on YouTube).

5683601,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"I bought season two about a month after it had released (I was unaware of the release date) and I couldn't be more happy.

For those of you new to MLP:FiM, season two is considered by many fans to be the more funnier of the seasons mainly because there were so much more pop culture references (""Back to the Future"", ""Tron"", ""127 Hours"", etc.) as opposed to season one and also where you got to hear Derpy Hooves (the often cross-eyed background pony; despite her name, she is NOT retarded nor referred to as such!) speak for the first time.

While I enjoyed re-watching season two all over, I have to admit there are some faults. While season two offers a more detailed look into the ""brony"" fan culture in the bonus features, it leaves out the audio commentary that made the season one DVD collection much more memorable. Also, season two was also best noted for not having very many songs, a key element (no pun intended) to the success of Season One. Lastly, and this being the biggest fault, they used the ""modified"" version of ""The Last Roundup"", which was adopted after controversy regarding her name being an able-ist slur (""Derp"") and an outright boycott of the show in April of 2012. You can tell where they ""butchered"" the episode into compliance versus the original, which I'm told is still available on ""The Friendship Express"" DVD.

Despite these issues, that shouldn't stop anyone from fully enjoying this collection. The songs are catchy as they are cute (""The Smile Song"" from ""A Friend in Deed"" is the best), the characters will keep you entertained for hours (about 12-13 to be exact) and you'll laugh (and possibly cry) while learning valuable lessons on friendship (believe me, it works!). If you're not a fan yet, I highly suggest buying this DVD collection (as well as Season One) and pairing this collection with ""The Elements of Harmony"" guidebook to give a much more detailed look into the show and why it's become such a pop culture phenomenon.

As they say ""Friendship truly is Magic""!",1373932800,3,2013,4.7102272727272725

5683612,4,B00C0YUY4Q,"When I first heard about this problem, I wasn't too bothered. To date, I had yet to see the edited ""de-derped"" version of The Last Roundup. Well, now I have.

But first, a bit of poop about the series as covered by this set. Just as with the first set, what we have here is a four DVD collection with each of the episodes plus a few extras. The cover art is different (I know that the cover art has occasionally been an issue with the single DVDs) and what you get also includes a number of extras including a live stage reading of Hearth's Warming Eve and a con panel plus the usual singalongs and colouring stuff. It's pretty much everything you got with the first set and more.

The series starts with the double episode epic about the rise of Discord and finishes with the saga of Twilight's brother and her former babysitter... well, I'll say no more than that! The whole series was a little more involved than the first, though it does include a couple of episodes that I don't really like watching, but whatever takes your fancy. The fact that it proudly proclaims that it has all 26 episodes, however, brings me back to the episode The Last Roundup.

The actual problem really only affects one scene. If you didn't know about the controversy around this scene... well it started because of one particular pony; a unicorn that became a fan favourite during the first season. Originally an unnamed background pony, she got the name ""Ditzy Doo"" during production. The fans, however, were unaware of this and the name ""Derpy Hooves"" emerged and stuck. Hence, when this character was given a few lines as a nod to the fans, Rainbow Dash is heard to say ""Careful now, Derpy!"" Objections suddenly came from offended folk who took the name ""Derpy"" as some sort of insult and, shortly after, an edited version was released with Rainbow's speech cut down to remove the name and Derpy's voice changed to make her sound more feminine. This is the whole extent of the edit.

On the plus side, Derpy's voice isn't that bad. On the minus side, it has shown that some intolerant people exist and that, yet again, freedom of speech and expression are being endangered because of misguided political correctness. Or not. You decide. For the record, you can still find the original version of this episode on the single DVD release ""The Friendship Express"".",1372636800,3,2346,4.618705035971223

Among the best things I noticed in this season(Which Btw I watched on The Hub before buying this) was a change in how each of the ponies interacted and that they all learned a lesson in one episode or another.

episode 16: Rainbow Dash learns not to knock something before you try it
episode 6: Apple Bloom learns patience after trying a risky shortcut to get her cutie mark
episode 8: Rainbow Dash learns about Humility
episode 23: the cutie mark crusaders learn not to spread gossip

In short, every pony learns something in this season. I think MLP is great no matter what. However, don't take my, or anyone else's word for it. See it for yourself, then make your choice.

But to sum it up, this is my opinion: It's a great show, and a great season.

Also on the cover are Twilight's brother, Shining Armor and his bride, Mi Amore Cadenza, or as Twilight called her back when she was her foal-sitter, Cadence.

The Bonus Features in this are pretty much the same, Printable Coloring Sheets, and some new Sing Alongs. However, unlike Season 1, there are no Commentaries on this for any of the episodes. On the back of the box art, and case, we see the Changeling Queen, her minions, and Discord. It looks okay. Only problem, Discord's tail has been cut off, and is missing. This art must've been rushed. No big deal though.

And one other downside, well, for some, or most of the Bronies anyway, while the DVD release entitled, ""The Friendship Express"" has the first-aired uncensored version of ""The Last Round-Up"" with Derpy Hooves' name spoken out, and herself still intact, the version in this Set is the edited version which left her name out, and both her eyes, and voice changed around; this was due to the response of the Pony Fans who felt that the character was pretty much offensive to the mentally disfigured; hence something called, ""The Derpy Hooves"" Controversy.

For you Bronies out there who like the first-aired version, and not the edited version, if you have a copy of the ""Friendship"" Express DVD in your posession with only THAT first-aired version, I suggest you hold onto it. For those of you, however, who like the 2nd version, this Season 2 set has just that. Me? I would've liked it better if Hasbro and Shout! Factory had BOTH Versions of that episode, but I think I can handle what they were able to put into this.

Regardless of the exclusion of the Commentaries, the flaw in the art work, and not including BOTH versions of the Last Round-Up, this DVD set is still worth checking out, especially if you get it from Amazon, which I did. Now we all wait to see how Season 3 turns out.

I give this DVD Set 5 stars out of 5.

5683633,5,B00C0YUY4Q,I really enjoyed season 2 and can't wait for season 3 to come out as well. This set has all the season 2 episodes in one collection so it is worth the cost.,1369785600,,156,3.757575757575758
5683634,4,B00C0YUY4Q,"Season 2 has many strong episodes and quite a few weak ones.  There are many points where you can tell the creative team was still trying to get a feel for the show after Faust's departure at the end of Season 1.  The season starts off strong with John DeLancie's Discord terrorizing Equestria in the two parter, Twilight going insane because she can't figure out what to write Princess Celestia, and Princess Luna trying to find her place in Equestrian society again after spending 1000 years on the moon.  There's a lot more world building and character development through the season.  Then comes the finale.  Everything in the finale seems to come out of left field.  If you weren't around to experience the hype and advertisement campaign, then you'll feel like you've been hit with a shovel in the first 5 minutes due to the addition of another character that you feel you should have heard of well before that point...  However you'll forget that in the second half when the finale decides to go off into epic territory again, even if it finds itself running out of time and hurriedly ties up the last few ends to the story.

While the Season 1 DVD set had commentaries on a handful of popular episodes, this DVD opted instead to have the first San Diego Comic Con panel and a live stage reading of one of the episodes.  While it is still neat to hear some behind the scenes information, episode specific commentaries are usually a bit more in depth and offer more insight into their creative process.  It also includes sing-a-longs of a few of the seasons songs (The Perfect Stallion, Smile Smile Smile, Love is in Bloom, Every Pony.  Every Pony is ""Becoming Popular"" but I guess they forgot the real name of the song...) and 6 color sheets with generic vectors of the main characters.

As for the packaging, it has seen a huge improvement over Season 1, even if Discord on the back is missing his tail.  The inside of the insert has a poster of all the Season 2 characters printed on it.  The only real gripe is that the glue holding the outer sleeve together is either faulty or it dried before the sleeve was pressed together and even that is just nitpicking.",1369785600,,2170,4.559278350515464

DVD includes a convention panel with most of the VAs, and a live reading of one of the episode scripts (again with MOST of the VAs). Those are nice, but are equal in length to about 3 episodes worth of commentary, which I would have rather had instead.

All whining aside, I'm waiting for the season 3 set (and hoping they add a lot of commentary to make up for the fact that it's a half-length season).",1369785600,,452,4.317647058823529

But ok in all honesty, this is a great set of dvd's, the artwork on the box is better then season ones overused vectors, the artwork inside the case is awesome. Even the disks show off all the most cannon ships, RariJack, RainbowPie, and Twilestia (Half-kidding, half-serious).

I am a little disappointed in the bonus features, but hey, its whatever. The live reading of Hearths Warming eve was pretty cool.

Last Roundup - ....Guys, come on. Now yes, I am a late bloomer, joining the fandom in the waiting period between season 2 and 3 so I was not really around to see the growth of derpy from an animation mistake to a loveable background character to finally having a speaking role. So yes, I get where you older fans can be a little upset at the fact its the ""un-derped"" version, but they do what they have to do and I don't think we should hate on this as a whole just because of that. Swallow that feeling of anger and be glad they even make these dvd sets...cause hell, with how quickly the episodes are being taken off of youtube/other websites, unless you wanna start pirating you might be out of options soon. Oh..and apparently you can get the derped version by spending 5 bucks on ""friendship express"" which if you order when you order this...you wouldn't need to pay separate shipping...so yeah, go do that.

The packaging is the exact same as season 1. It's all in one case. There are four disc holders inside. The picture is 1:78 Anamorphic Widescreen. The sound is 5.1 Surround.

For special features there is:

""Hearth's Warming Eve"" A Live Stage Reading. (Meghan McCarthy (the writer for most of the episodes except this one, Merriweather Williams wrote Hearths Warming Eve) reads the script and the other voice actors say their lines. Most of the voice actors for the Mane 6 (plus Spike) are there except Tabitha St. Germain (Rarity). That didn't stop them though, some girl volunteered from the audience and they let her do it. She was really nervous but she did a pretty good job. it's very fun and there's a lot of laughing. It lasts for about 43 minutes.

MLP FIM Comic-Con panel in San Diego. This time Ashleigh  Ball is missing (Rainbow Dash/ Applejack) but everyone else is there. They talk about how it is working on MLP and have fun talking in their characters voices randomly. They also answer some questions from the audience. Lasts about 34 minutes.

Sing-Alongs for

""The Perfect Stallion""

""Love is in Bloom""

Smile, Smile, Smile""

""Becoming popular: The pony every-pony ought to know""  It's just called ""Everypony"" in the list though.

5683646,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"When it came to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, I begun to check it out late August 2011 after noticing how popular it was on some web sites (and finally putting some effort into watching The Hub). While it was slow, I eventually became a fan of the show in time for the show's second season, and that season definitely gave me a good reason to get up early on Saturdays.

This season, the world of My Little Pony started to expand a lot more thanks to the show dropping the requirement of having Twilight Sparkle be in every episode just for the sake of having her write a Friendship Report, and there's definitely a lot of fun moments to be have. Among the highlights: a Halloween episode that marks the return of Princess Luna; an episode that focuses on Rarity's sisterly relationship with Sweetie Belle; a Christmas episode that tells about the founding of Equestria; a pair of excellent episodes involving mousy pony Fluttershy (the first involves her trying to be more assertive, while the other has her being concerned with her ""performance issues"" when Rainbow Dash wants her to take part in making a cyclone that will carry water to Cloudsdale for the rain season); and a number of memorable songs (a couple of which were nominated for a Daytime Emmy last year).

As for bonus features, while there may not be any audio commentaries this go-round, there's at least a couple of them that will interest older viewers. The first one is a live reading of ""Hearth's Warming Eve"" by the show's cast (and an audience member filling in for the absent Tabitha St. Germain) that was performed at the Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles last May. It's worth checking out not only for the ""live"" feel (especially as there's a few flubs during the reading), but also to see what was changed from the original script for Hearth's Warming Eve to the final project. The other bonus is the My Little Pony panel at Comic Con 2012, with the panelist consisting of some of the show's cast members and its current story editor, Meghan McCarthy.

In short: if you're a fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, then this DVD is a must buy.

P. S. For those wondering: the version of ""The Last Roundup"" on this set is the censored version, so you may want to keep your copy of ""The Friendship Express"" (if you have it) if you want the original version of said episode.",1368489600,28,2362,4.563679245283019
5683647,3,B00C0YUY4Q,"I give the actual show 5/5 stars. But this DVD is only average.

One of the best parts of the Season 1 DVD were the excellent commentaries, including commentary by showrunner Jayson Thiessen, composer Daniel Ingram, and many of the voice actors. They were extremely entertaining and informative, and I was greatly looking forward to the Season 2 commentaries.

But, for some reason, Shout Factory and/or Hasbro decided not to include any commentaries at all on this DVD. It's really a bummer, I was really excited to hear commentaries especially for The Return of Harmony and A Canterlot Wedding. (Commentary for The Last Roundup would have been fascinating but there's no way they would have touched that with a 10 foot pole).

But instead there are no commentaries whatsoever. And, this DVD's other special features are fairly boring, including coloring pages, singalongs (of which there are more and better fan made ones available online), a live reading of one of the scripts, and a recording of a SDCC panel (which can already be viewed online). The live reading is the only one that sounds somewhat interesting.

So if you already have all the Season 2 episodes, there's really no reason to buy this DVD, since the special features are so disappointing. Some commentaries, animatics, or maybe even a proper ""making-of"" would have been awesome.

Note: Derpy *is* censored in this version, but that did not affect my review score. I was disappointed with the change originally but have come to accept it.

Some of the episodes in this dvd are things you can watch over and over and over again. Lesson Zero still holds the trophy for the funniest and craziest episode in the series. The Royal Wedding was the first time we got to see DJ-P0n-3's eyes. And we got to hear Derpy talk in The Last Roundup. Yep, it's a great season. This is definitely worth the $30 they're asking for it. I'm extremely happy that they're finally releasing it!",1367712000,,556,4.355769230769231
5683649,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"OK, season II.. Some of the best moments of the series (So far, anyway. Hear that Season IV writers??) Anyway, we had two of the best episodes EVER in ""Lesson Zero"" and ""Luna Eclipsed"" plus the super-popular unofficial brony anthem ""Smile, Smile, Smile"" Of course we can't forget that finally, in Season 2, DERPY SPEAKS!! At least until she didn't. But everyone knows that story. So let's get to the reason for the title of this review; ""A mite confused.'

  When SHOUT! released Season I to DVD, I thought; ""Yay!, I can't wait to go buy one!"" then I heard that it was going to be sold exclusively on Amazon. It was still yay, and I still bought it. ""But why,"" I wondered; ""Sell it exclusively online, when selling it at stores like Wal-Mart, Target, etc, would generate tons more sales?"" It wasn't as if other MLP DVD products weren't already available at these places, because they were.

  ""OK"", I thought; ""Since Hasbro/Hub/DHX/SHOUT! are obviously for-profit companies, and putting the boxed set in general distribution would probably generate ADDITIONAL profit, there must be another motive."" So what was that motive? After quite a bit of thought, I came up with this;

  ""Ever since the brony phenomenon exploded out of 4Chan, Hasbro, (and to a lesser extent, Hub), have been at sort of a loss about what to do with all us bronies, and how to handle us. In Season II we began to see nods to the fandom in things like more frequent appearances of Derpy, the actual mentioning of Bronies in the extended version of the ""Equestria Girls"" song, and so on. Then Derpy-Gate happened. Derpy was suddenly persona-non-grata, and her appearances were drastically reduced in Season III. From this we can deduce that Hasbro is very image-conscious in relating to the public, and anything that casts them in a negative light (such as being ""insensitive"" to those with certain disabilities,) will cause them to retreat and/or retract the perceived offensive material. No surprise here, I imagine most corporations do that.

 However, most corporations don't have a huge, obsessed, definitely NOT the target audience fandom surrounding a ""product"" like Hasbro has been blessed with. And here once again we come to the subject of money. Hasbro and hub I am CERTAIN keep an eye on the brony community. They know we spend an amazing amount of money on pony-related swag. Just look in at a typical brony convention. young girls are not usually the ones buying the $200.00+ plushies. However, most of that expensive merch. isn't licensed by Hasbro. What Hasbro DOES have is the ability to create licensed DVD boxes sets of the series. And I am sure they know bronies will buy thousands of them. In fact, the Season I DVD set broke several sales records.

  But why sell it ONLY on Amazon? I think the Big Brains at Hasbro wanted to separate the sales to bronies from the sales to parents of the target demographic. if the Set was sold everywhere instead of just Amazon, you would never know how many were sold to bronies who came to the store LOOKING for the DVD, and how many were sold to families who happened to come across the DVD while shopping.

  Selling it on Amazon, however, would pretty much guarantee that whoever bought it there was there because they knew about it, and was willing to buy it online, if that was the only way they could get it. And while I have no doubt some purchasers were the parents of young kids, they would compose a much smaller percentage then if it was sold at Wal-Mart. So, Hasbro wanted to know how many they could sell to mainly bronies. Why? well, Since Hasbro is aware of the extensive amount of merchandise bronies buy, and the amounts of money we are willing to pay for it (See above), and the less than stellar quality, shall we say, of many MLP products sold in stores (not counting, of course, the excellent vinyls sold through Hot Topic), Hasbro is looking into launching a new high-quality, animation-correct toy line.

  But to do this they wanted a fairly accurate estimate of how many bronies would spend the extra money to buy such items. Selling S.1 exclusively online would give such a number. And while it might hurt profits in the short-term, it WOULD generate enough money later on, if the merchandising were done correctly. And of course launching a new semi-exclusive, fairly expensive toy line is a gamble, and Hasbro wanted to make sure the numbers would be there to justify the expense.'

  Proud of my powers of deduction, I confidently expected, if S.1 sold well on Amazon, Season II would, when released, be available everywhere. And S. 1 would be re-released at the same time to general distribution. Apparently, this is incorrect. S. 2 will be sold only on Amazon, just like S.1. So I am a mite confused. Why do this when selling it everywhere would net them a LOT more money? I don't know yet. I'll try to find out. Anyone who has an alternate idea or theory is welcome to comment on this post, and I'll be glad to read them.",1366329600,4,4983,4.676201372997712

5683652,5,B00C0YUY4Q,"A little after the first season ended, Lauren Faust announced she was leaving the show. Fans were worried about her decision and felt that the show wouldn't recover without her. However, the crew that she left behind proved them wrong.

The show's crew not only captures what made the first season so good, they expand off of it. The first season did it's job of establishing the characters and getting the fans to fall in love with them. This season continues to disect what makes these characters tick, and puts them in more creative and hilarious situations.

For example, there's an episode where Rainbow Dash hurts her wing and has to stay bed ridden in the hospital. Twilight offers her a book, but Rainbow Dash doesn't consider herself an ""egghead"" so she refuses. However, boredom gets the best of her and she starts to read the book, getting obsessed with it.

There's another one where Fluttershy is influence by a public speaker her teaches her how to be more assertive, but she takes it a little too far.

Then, there's another one where a donkey moves into Ponyville and Pinkie Pie tries to become friends with them. When he refuses, it drives Pinkie to do her best to when his friendship.

Yes, I think this season topped season one. Unlike most cartoons that get worse as they keep going (Spongebob, anyone?) FIM is getting better and better, and this season is a great example of that. So, if you enjoyed season 1, I don't think I have to tell you to give season 2 a look. It has everything that made the first season so great, and more...
