8565456,3,B00BBKOTNW,different...would have liked it better if they developed the story more....too short!!,1475452800,,86,6.25
8565457,1,B00BBKOTNW,So what if the book is good. Do not purchase this video. Only a few minutes long and sound is terrible. Angry! Total waste of money.,1453593600,,132,4.115384615384615
8565458,4,B00BBKOTNW,"This was such a grat follow up to the read aloud I did with my first graders!  The only complaint that I have is that the sound was very quiet. Even with the computer volume up and speaker volume up the voices were almost inaudible. The narrator and music was very loud, but the other voices were too soft and really hard to hear. Luckily we read the story before so the students kind of knew what they were saying. That is why I only gave it 4 stars",1446336000,,450,4.056179775280899

8565460,1,B00BBKOTNW,"Unfortunately, I did not see before purchasing that the running time is only 11 minutes! At a cost of more than a dollar a minute, I think it is not worth it. Just buy the book.",1419897600,,177,3.9444444444444446
8565461,5,B00BBKOTNW,"The book, with it's rich text and plot twists within the illustrations has long been a Halloween standard in my classroom no matter what grade level I was teaching.  Mr. Piotrowski's film provides a long awaited companion piece.  The differences in point of view and central message create lively student discussions.  I couldn't wait for my DVD to arrive.  My class watched me open the package and burst into applause.",1386115200,2,419,4.942857142857143
8565462,5,B00BBKOTNW,Great film to complement the book.,1383782400,,34,4.833333333333333
