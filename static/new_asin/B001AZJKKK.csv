3476306,4,B001AZJKKK,"Antoine is a grouchy character when we meet him, presenting a sour face to the world, lusting hopelessly after his neighbor Claire. When his father is stricken by a heart attack, Antoine has the chance to grow up.

His father runs a gorcery store in a village somewhere in southern France, Antoine starts driving the mobile shop that takes supplies to the very remote villages in the mountains most of which are sparsely inhabited by old people.

It takes a while but slowly Antoine begins his journey toward becoming a proper human being -- what we call a mensch.

It's a nice journey and we're happy to take it in this pleasant movie full of beautiful scenery, good acting and admirable sentiments.",1255305600,,700,4.721311475409836
3476307,5,B001AZJKKK,A perfect movie showing the French lifestyle that made me love France so much. Plus Cazale is so good!! I never thoughr to be able to buy this movie. Thanks so much for always having just what I want!,1253923200,,200,4.153846153846154
3476308,4,B001AZJKKK,"""The Grocer's Son"" tells a quiet story.  Young Antoine (Nicolas Cazale) returns from Paris to his home town in Provence to tend his parents' small store while his father recovers from a heart attack.  His friend Claire (Clotilde Hasme) comes along.  His parents' family business includes an old van that makes the round of local crossroads, selling groceries mostly to the elderly.  So Antoine begins making the daily rounds.

The photography of the Provence countryside is wonderful.  The village scenes and the elderly actors give a viewer an agreeable glimpse of another country and society.  There's French languor and mood music.  The film's low key and slow pace help focus on the characters and how they change in the course of the film -- as Antoine, whose life in Paris had been unsuccessful, comes back into the ties of family and community which he had once rejected.

As we see from other relationships in the film (Antoine's brother, or his high school friend who runs the local garage), though, ties that bind can also be ties that burden.  Willingness to accept the burdens is an important milestone in life.

""The Grocer's Son"" harks back to the story of the Prodigal Son, set in a different place and time.  When so many movies feature exploding cars, robots or aliens, or stomach-turning crimes, ""The Grocer's Son"" provides a welcome change of pace.

3476309,5,B001AZJKKK,"I don't mean to lessen the impact of THE GROCER'S SON by describing it as a sweet, beautiful film, but ""it is"" a ""sweet, beautiful"" film. After all, it stars Provence's bucolic sumptuousness and actor Nicolas Cazale's boyish-lips-but-ALL-man seductiveness. But there's more: it doesn't force its characters into bloom; it provides the right amount of light, and darkness, to urge each character's vulnerability--sweetness--to open up and gradually scent his/her and viewers' understanding. And no character is required to ""change"" into something s/he hasn't been all along. Petunias remain petunias, lilies remain lilies, and thistles remain thistles, but all are infused and brightened  by internal and external tenderness. The viewers are also infused and brightened.

So, I suggest you treat your eyes, nose, taste buds, and your writing to THE GROCER'S SON. Why? Sweet beauty.",1235260800,3,880,5.559701492537314
3476310,4,B001AZJKKK,"**SPOILERS**

Even from his earliest days, Antoine Sfouza has made it the goal of his life not to have anything to do with the family business.  That`s why, in his late teens, he left the town where he was born and raised and headed off to the big city in search of fame, fortune and a better life for himself.  The problem is that now, at the ripe old age of thirty, Antoine finds himself an embittered ne'er-do-well loser, waiting tables in a sidewalk cafe and living in a dreary one-room flat in Paris, all but estranged from the family that raised him.  But after his father is hospitalized with a heart attack, Antoine reluctantly returns to help his mother and brother run the grocery store, which, as a part of its service, operates a van that travels around the local countryside, selling goods in towns and villages too remote to have a fully stocked grocery store of their own.  It becomes Antoine's job to drive and man the van, even though his gloomy demeanor and prickly personality don't make him exactly a prime candidate for such an assignment.

Eric Guirado`s ""The Grocer's Son"" might just as easily have been titled ""The Grocer's Prodigal Son,"" since the movie is a fairly transparent update of that well-known story from the Bible.  Yet, lucky for us, the screenplay by Guirado and Florence Vignon fleshes out the allegory with fully realized characters and the kind of family dynamics that can only be hinted at in a brief parable.  In a carefully understated performance, Nicolas Cazale plays the brooding, almost completely unsmiling Antoine, who eventually comes to learn that a life spent cut off from the people around him is no life at all.  The charming Clotilde Hesme co-stars as the free-spirited and independent 26-year-old college student who rooms and boards with the family and who becomes a major catalyst for change in the young man`s life.

This is a movie that sneaks up on you slowly and wins you over by degrees - until, in the last half hour or so, it becomes a lyrical, really quite beautiful tale of redemption and compassion, of accepting responsibility and finding one's place in the world.  Add to the mix an array of sweet and winning performances by a tremendously gifted cast, a lilting musical score by Christophe Boutin (played mainly on guitar), and generous helpings of lovely French countryside rolling on by, and you have a truly touching and memorable film that will lift your spirits and, for a brief moment at least, make everything seem right with the world.",1231718400,7,2516,4.760919540229885
3476311,3,B001AZJKKK,"Antoine is a 30-year-old slacker who lives in Paris and is ""between jobs."" He fancies that by leaving home ten years earlier he had escaped his parent's lives as country bumpkins. But when his father takes ill, and his brother is too busy with his hair salon, Antoine returns home with his friend Claire to help his mother with their tiny general store. Back in Paris, his friend Hassan had advised Antoine that he ""lacked the human touch."" The gist of this film is how he reconnects with his own self, with Claire, with his family, and even with the shut-ins and pensioners of the French countryside. One customer ""pays"" for his can of peas with eggs. Another advises him that his father was gruff but that he always took her to get her hair done. Others want to run a tab and pay when they can. Many are hard of hearing and can't do the arithmetic to pay. Eventually, Antoine comes to respect these aging customers who depend on him, and to enjoy the life of his father that he had previously spurned.

3476312,5,B001AZJKKK,"It's been a while since I saw a French film that I really liked.  I think the last one was LES VOLLEURS that starred Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil.  There was a time when France used to make brilliant films, one right after the other.  This was called the French New Wave that consisted of Truffaut, Goddard, Rohmer, etc.  Well, I'm happy to report that THE GROCER'S SON is every bit as good as anything that came out of the French New Wave.  Actually, it reminded me more of a Rohmer film: a character study.  It's a very observant and perceptive film on growing up: when someone stops thinking about themselves and appreciates other people.  The relationship between Antoine and Claire exemplifies this point.  Antoine is clearly only thinking about himself when he decides not to mail Claire's academic papers.  Eventually, he takes on life's responsibilities (he decides not to quit his job as a grocer) and starts thinking about other people (his customers).  Highly recommended.",1220227200,23,991,4.9156626506024095
3476313,5,B001AZJKKK,"Le Fils de l'picier (The Grocer's Son) is one of the loveliest films of the year.  Written (with Florence Vignon) and  directed by Eric Guirado, this little taste of French life is as refreshing as the fruits and vegetables on the traveling grocery van that is a focal point of the story.  Though at first glance it appears to be a simple tale of a son begrudgingly taking over his invalid father's business, Guirado has embroidered this story with so many warm details that the film begs to be seen again and again to make sure nothing has been missed.

Antoine Sforza (the gifted and handsome young actor Nicolas Cazal) is a thirty something young waiter, unable to find satisfaction in his various jobs he opted for when he left his home ten years ago: his relationship with his father was strained and Antoine did not care to 'waste' his life in a village as an grocer (picier). He has a 'girlfriend' Claire (Clotilde Hesme) who is trying to save money to go to Spain to study, and when his father (Daniel Duval)  is hospitalized with a heart attack, he begrudgingly agrees to return home - with the proviso that his mother lend him money that he in turn gives to Claire so that she can complete her dream of studying in Spain.  Antoine's brother Franois (Stphan Gurin-Tilli) owns a beauty salon and, despite the family's concept that he is the stable one, has troubles of his own.  Antoine's mother (Jeanne Goupil) is desperate for help: she has managed to run the little store in the village, but a major source of income has come from the van the father drives through the countryside, selling groceries to the old folks.  Antoine is encouraged by Claire to take over the van and even helps Antoine paint the van with rainbow colors to become the 'picier Volante'.  In time Antoine's brusque and distant personality is affected by the warmly humorous and significantly needy yet friendly old folks.  He makes friends and extends himself as never before.

Claire wins her audition for Spain, the father is released form the hospital, Franois' life falls apart, and Antoine feels he must pay back his mother and move on.  But the bonds between the changed Antoine and his family as well as his deep attachments to the old folks convince him to alter his plan for his life.

Many of the 'old folks' are cast from villagers who Guirado met while scouting for his film and these 'actors', together with some very fine character actors such as Liliane Rovre, give the film a feeling of authenticity.  The scenery is gorgeous, the music is apropos, and the performances by the lead members of the cast are superb.  This is a film to treasure - repeatedly.  Highest Recommendation.

3476353,5,B001AZJKKK,"I've been lured back to this film a few times. The setting is gorgeous, yes, but that's just a piece of its draw.  It's mainly its simple complexity, natural pace and content, absence of contrivance.  An angry grocer, who has just suffered a heart attack, maintains a deprecating to abusive behavior toward his sons and often his wife. He expects his sons not to measure up, particularly Antoine (Nicolas Cazale), so they don't, as in self-fulfilling...  The father doesn't seem to get it, that it is his contempt that has kept Antoine away.  But his father's illness has required Antoine's return, to drive the grocery truck to serve the distant, aging, some infermed, some poor,
customers whose tiny orders would certainly not practically reconcile with the effort or the books. At first, all these folks are an annoyance to Antoine.  Additionally, having  learned distancing (not regarding grocery trucks) from his dad, he in turn holds the lovely Claire (Clotilde Hesme) at bay.  But Nature will have its way.  In this instance,  it appears to sooth the savage in him, soften the hard edges.  The rest remains to be seen.  All components of filmmaking are top notch. The acting is prime.

He takes the girl he has a crush on home to try to keep her from going away to school while he's helping his parents run their grocery store in a little mountain town in France. The cultural tone of the movie held a curious charm for me. I loved that part of it. I fell in love with the movie when the 'prodigal son' began to realize how much the people his father catered to needed their services.

Sullen and resentful, he manages to alienate the customers and reopen old family wounds.  But under the influence of his warm-hearted girlfriend Claire (Clotilde Hesme) he begins to mellow, eventually drawing close to the crotchety old folks he serves and reconnecting with his estranged father and brother.

Cazale is superb as the brooding Antoine, and Hesme is terrific as Claire.  Indeed the entire cast is fine.  The lovingly photographed French countryside provides a beautiful backdrop.

This is a quiet, restrained movie.  If you are looking for lots of action you won't find it here.  But if you are interested in a good solid drama about family relationships, this is just the ticket.",1336435200,,926,5.126666666666667

Its a story about an irresponsible son living in Paris who must go back to his home to look after the family business. The idea is common enough but the presentation and exploration of all the drama and issues that come with making any life altering move is outstanding. Movies like this that keep your interest up with all the exploration of ordinary life (in this case French country side life) is what I think draws people to Indie flicks again and again.,1330387200,,532,4.494845360824742

3476704,4,B001AZJKKK,"THE GROCER'S SON (original French title: ""Le fils de l'&eacute;picier"") must've had a budget of chump change found in the sofa. Which doesn't keep it from being a lovely little film coming out of France. Its story unfolds in leisurely fashion. It chronicles the gradual change in attitude of a sullen, self-involved man long estranged from his family.

30-year-old Antoine Sforza (Nicolas Cazal&eacute;) set out to the big city ten years ago to make his own way. Except that, habitually surly and resentful (his brother accuses him of lacking the ""human touch""), Antoine has not had a success of it. Then, an ailing father compels his move back home, to the rolling hills of the Provence countryside to assume the family business of driving the grocery truck from hamlet to hamlet.

Antoine's detached demeanor earns him no points with the elderly villagers, them what serve as his father's primary clientele. But here is Antoine's friend from the city, Claire (Clotilde Hesme), 26-years-old and lovely and free-spirited and warm, who has tagged along to Provence to find peace and quiet while she studies for a correspondence course in hopes of gaining admission to a college in Spain. One day, Claire decides to accompany Antoine on his produce run. She has an instant affect on the customers and on Antoine, naturally. I say naturally, because he's been secretly crushing on her since forever.

Slowly, Antoine comes around. He begins to make connections with them brusque, independent old fogies, begins to warm to the pastoral way of life, begins to calm down. It's a turnaround that feels utterly believable and organic. The film doesn't cheat you; there is no extraneous sappiness. THE GROCER'S SON produces a slow burn appeal and supremely natural performances from the cast. There is grace in the acting here. Nicolas Cazal&eacute; and Clotilde Hesme are practically perfect, Cazal&eacute; subtle and low key, Hesme consistently brightening up the room. The conflict rises from the Sforza family's wealth of stored grievances. Antoine nurses fractured relationships with his father and brother. His father gazes at him with deep-seated contempt and disappointment, thinking him a selfish slacker. His older brother, Francois, insists that he finally take responsibility in caring for the family. Francois himself is going thru harrowing times, unable to tell his parents that his wife had left him. It's all Madame Sforza can do to stay neutral. Even she starts showing cracks.

THE GROCER'S SON is cautiously optimistic. There's a sort of love story, but how it turns out is left up in the air, because in real life there are no guarantees. I have a thing for free-spirited femmes, so I too am harboring my own crush on the gamine Clotilde Hesme. This movie was a surprise box office hit in France, but, truly, it's easy to see why. There are moments of quiet heartbreak, but also uplifting moments and humorous moments and kind moments. You get sucked into the story and invested into Antoine and Claire. The village elders themselves are gruff but endearing, with the feisty Lucienne (Liliane Rov&egrave;re) and the old gent what pays for his produce with eggs as the standouts.

For Antoine Sforza, who is 30 years old, it's a tardy coming of age. But at least it's come.

This DVD also presents the film short, ""One Weekend A Month,"" in which a frantic military mom learns that she is about to be deployed on short notice, leaving no one to care for her children. Running time is 00:11:40 minutes.",1325548800,,3511,4.993162393162393
3476705,5,B001AZJKKK,"This is a pleasant French film about the people of the French countryside.  When a traveling grocer gets quite ill, his son has to return from the city and head back to his native countryside village to take over his father's job.  The son travels with a truck from which he sells food and other provisions to mostly older people, with the rest being families and singles.  It really is a nod and acknowledgement of the vagaries, oddities, and commonalities of the citizens of the French countryside.

The only nudity, (some may not consider it nudity), is when the son sees a small part of the breast near the arm when he looks at the bathroom where his friend is changing clothes.  The door is slightly ajar and he ""spies"" on her.  Much later, they retire to a room and it is implied (off-screen) that they spent the night together.  I actually consider this very tame in comparison to other films.",1314230400,,900,4.552795031055901

3476707,5,B001AZJKKK,"Sweet gem of a film by director Eric Guirado about the simple life in the countryside and the drama that arises between family, friends, and customers.  When Antoine (Nicolas Cazale) returns home to help his father's business after his father falls ill, Guirado shows us the lovely landscapes and people that inhabit his former home and life.  All of the characters are fascinating and full of their own personal problems; everyone has to make sacrifices and work hard.  We meet his brother, Francois, who helped out with the grocer business after Antoine left, and we are introduced to the goofy and lovably harsh customers as Antoine goes around in a van selling their wares.  Of course, there is romance: Antoine is joined by Claire (Clotilde Hesme), who he knows from the city.  Claire is adorable and proactive as she quickly undertakes her new role as Antoine's business partner, painting the truck and joyfully meeting with customers.  Cazale and Hesme are both wonderfully cast and brilliant to watch; had the supporting cast not been as fantastic as they were, Cazale and Hesme could have carried the film by themselves.  Instead, though, we are lucky to have this beautiful film with great direction and filming and an equally talented cast.",1307923200,,1251,4.985576923076923
3476718,4,B001AZJKKK,"Some months ago I discovered and have started watching the releases from the Film Movement's on-going library of foreign and indie releases and recently I picked this one up.

""The Grocer's Son"" (96 min.; originally released in France in 2007) brings the tale of Antoine, whose father, the grocer, falls ill, and as a result Antoine leaves the big city (Lyon) and returns to Southern France to take over the delivery route his father did, bringing groceries in a van (at some point renamed ""The Flying Grocer"") to mostly elderly folks in the countryside. The movie moves slowly, and that is exactly the point, as the movie ultimately is an ode to the slower and simpler life of people in the remote country side. Along the way, Antoine fights with his family, discovers love and comes to appreciate the lifestyle on the country side that he thought he had left for good. The beautiful scenery in Southern France is as equally an important part of the movie than the actors themselves.

In all, I quite liked this movie. Nothing earth shattering, but a slice of life simpler and slower than most of us are used to. I also can't say enough about the outstanding quality of continuing releases of great foreign and indie movies by Film Movement.",1296950400,2,1242,4.71889400921659

Accompanied by his friend Claire (whom he's got a crush on) Antoine has to deal with new realities and inhabitants of the country side. This is a beautifully portrayed personal emotional journey and a study of the idea that one can find his happiness in less unexpected circumstances.",1292889600,,486,4.7976190476190474
3476720,4,B001AZJKKK,"A beautiful film--good story, excellent cast and superb setting.  Lead actor, Nicolas Cazale, won a French Oscar (Cesar) nomination and the film and cast garnered several festival awards.  ""The Grocer's Son"" follows a familiar theme--returning home to find oneself.  In this case, it's 30-year old Antoine Sforza who's been bouncing around Lyons for some years, who grudgingly returns to help out his mother run the family grocery store in the French countryside after his father's disabling heart attack.  The habitually self-absorbed Antoine drives a grocery truck on a village circuit that services a wide group of elderly rural folk and finds himself challenged to be more than just a butter and egg salesman.  Antoine comes to realize that his daily appearance with the truck is often as much a social service as a source of provender.  Antoine's savvy neighbor and secret crush, Claire, whom he has brought to the village with him, has this figured out rather quickly and does what she can to steer him in the direction of harmony with the clients.

As he gradually evolves as a grocer and local citizen and neighbor, Antoine is also pushed into resolving his ongoing conflicts with his father and brother--both of whom have more serious problems than he does.  All of this adds up to a very agreeable coming of age story, albeit one with the frequently vague French-film ending where not every loose end is completely tied off.  This is my thoroughly American take on the conclusion; a French filmgoer would probably see it differently.

In any event, a lovely film with the additional pleasures of interesting and amusing secondary characters and gorgeous scenery (looks like southern Auvergne or Rhone Valley to me) as backdrop.  Highly recommended.",1290902400,4,1758,5.069444444444445
3476721,5,B001AZJKKK,"""Grocer's Son"" is a charming little movie.  It builds slowly and wins you over at the end.  Working in its favor: the inherent likability of its two leads, Nicolas Cazal as the brooding, sensitive Antoine and Clotilde Hesme, super-adorable as Claire.

The storyline by co-writers Eric Guirado (who's also the film's director) and Florence Vignon is pitch-perfect.  Antoine, floundering professionally and personally in the big city, returns to his village to help out in his parents' shop (and, more notably, their food truck) after his Dad's stroke.  Antoine and his Dad have never gotten along, adding to the son's less-than-sunny outlook on what will happen back home.  Indeed, the old antagonisms between father and son soon arise.  The one bright spot: Antoine has invited his erstwhile urban neighbor, Claire, to the village for the chance to allow her to complete her studies free from the city's cacophony.

The plot device here is the food truck - it's [literally] the vehicle that allows Antoine to get out and see the town and interact with the populace.  This isn't a cool, hip food truck circa 2010 serving the likes of Belgian Waffles and Korean Tacos in trendy urban settings.  Rather, Guirado and Vignon are showing us how local shopkeepers have used these trucks to service the remote, elderly and car-less in rural France.  It's a fascinating, realistic peek at French life.

Over time, it's the truck that is Antoine's salvation.  Despite a very shaky start, he slowly builds his salesmanship and people skills and - as a by-product - the relationship with his father.  What doesn't hurt is Claire's effortless charm, on full, natural display the times she comes along in the truck.  There's a rupture in the slowly building Antoine/Claire relationship in the last-third of the film.  Antoine comes to the slow realization that he has to win her back.  He launches a low-key, long-distance charm offensive, completely in character.

All in all, I got tremendous enjoyment out of ""The Grocer's Son.""  Guirado and Vignon have crafted a real winner, one that smells and feels like life as it's actually played out.",1288828800,5,2130,5.017094017094017

3476724,3,B001AZJKKK,"This would have been a much better film for me, were it not for the fact that it's been done before.  The Grocer's Son is virtually identical to ""Washington Heights"", a film released in 2002.

In Washington Heights (set in New York), an aspiring artist is forced to take over his small family grocery store after his father becomes bedridden.  The sullen lead character rubs his father's customers the wrong way, including those who were used to special arrangements.  Of course, by the film's conclusion, the grocer's son inevitably realizes how special the store is to the community.  Is this starting to sound familiar yet?

So even though I loved the footage of the French countryside, it was a little disappointing that this movie shared the exact same plot as one I had previously seen.",1264550400,8,792,4.82962962962963

I thought she was a hooker, but then Ant was giving her money to go to college, then she was going with Ant to stay at his parents' place. Huh!  It was never clear to me why Ant's relationship w/ his father was SO sour.  Even if one leaves home, one doesn't need to completely cut off relations w/ parents.  Then the brother -- a not very well developed thread -- TWO years he had been separated from his wife, still thinking they would get back together, and his parents didn't know that? I also thought Ant's ""conversion"" was too sudden.

3476726,5,B001AZJKKK,"The Grocer's Son, 2007 is a light-hearted comedy drama written, directed and screenplay by Eric Guirado. The setting is the beautiful French countryside, the village of Provence with its sweeping lush green landscape.  The movie is distributed by Film Movement, an organization designed to distribute some of the best foreign film that may not have been distributed through normal channels.  The soundtrack is sparse.  There is no commentary on the DVD, which naturally is helpful to many.

The role of protagonist Antoine, is a handsome young man 30ish, who has been away from home for 10 years in the big city, only to come back when he receives news that his father has had a heart attack.  Father learns of his return and expresses clearly his discontent with his son.  Antoine has a despondent brother Francois, who doesn't provide much to the family either.  The storyline with the brother fails to really develop which, in turn, seems out of place.  It is for his mother that he reluctantly agrees to help with the grocery business which includes a grocery/merchandise truck on wheels that delivers to the countryside's demanding and quirky elderly patrons.

It is here that he learns that life does not accept your attitude, just because you dish it out.  Antoine, along with a female friend who he brought to staying with the family, makes the deliveries.  The two have different ideas about displaying their people skills for keeping up with the demands of  the feisty elderly as customers.

But watch, as Antoine learns what it takes to keep the business rolling.  ....Rizzo",1260576000,,1585,4.954545454545454
3476727,5,B001AZJKKK,"Sulky, indifferent, wayward, son Antoine reluctantly agrees to run his sick father's grocery business. Elder son Francois is far too busy trying to make good in his hairdressing salon and feels he's done enough already. Antoine is accompanied to the south of France by a neighbour, Claire, under the pretext that she would find it easier to study in the countryside, rather than in the hustle and bustle of Paris.

Antoine's utter ineptitude and inability to relate to the elderly, rustic clientele prompts Claire to develop an interest in the travelling grocery side of the business. Meanwhile, the story fairly crackles with the dialogue of family dysfunction, batting back and forth between the characters like a mountain thunder storm. Claire is a hapless by-stander as the grocer's wife does her best to retain her dignity, while the men snipe at each other.

By contrast the scenery is stunning, showing the beauty of this mountainous region of France. The aging customers served by The Van are full of life, humour, vigour and eccentricity, and there are many well-observed and humorous moments.

A `will they, won't they' theme develops between Antoine and Claire. It is tantalisingly drawn out across most of the film, adding suspense to the other tensions and frictions between expertly portrayed characters. The inept and gruff male characters are mercilessly harangued and tripped by the female characters in an attempt to make them see sense and change their views of life and relationships. Will it ever dawn on the father and his sons that the reason they have trouble with other people is their own stubborn fault?
