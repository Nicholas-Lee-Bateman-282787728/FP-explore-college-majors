7812557,4,6301486277,"I'm a big fan of 80's cartoons and I think that  the tigersharks cartoon show was awesome and they should be on the air again along with the thundercats, silverhawks, bionic six, ect. It's a shame that everything old  is new again and in movies like for example ""inspector gadget"",  and yet cool cartoons like the tigersharks and the others I spoke about  earlier aren't in the ""new"" list. I hope that in the near future  will see these cartoons reborn in movies.",951004800,4,463,4.530120481927711
