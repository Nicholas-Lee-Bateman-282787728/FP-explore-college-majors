8289238,4,B001CU5TE4,Best of the History Ch.'s JFK Cover-up DVDs. The bit about the faked x-rays was very good. The bit about the acoustic evidence(which shows more than 3 shots fired(there fore a plot)was terrific. Interested viewers should check-out the book: HEAD SHOT by Dr. G.P.Chambers(physicist)who shows that JFK was hit by 2 guns not 1. It's offered on Amazon.com.,1430179200,,352,5.086206896551724

8289241,4,B001CU5TE4,"Bill Kurtis may not be seen as one of the top ten news anchors of the 20th century, but he is certainly one of the more likeable ones.  That is likely because he presents news, and history, by simply reporting - and doesn't inject various personal biases.  He does so in an entertainment format and by nature of that isn't, perhaps, considered in the same breath of say a Cronkite.  To me that makes him more everyman's news gatherer, one without an apparent agenda.  That is what he brings to this circa 2004 piece which looks at some of the later day findings surrounding the JFK assassination.

This film centers around a conference where much new information was brought forth as being very viable in the beliefs of a large portion of the American public that the JFK assissination was an elaborate conspiracy.  In my own research I have definitely come to that conclusion and it is hard to see how one could think otherwise.  For instance there is great credibility presented here on the largely unknown ""5-shot"" belief.  Now many possessing a casual knowledge of the events that day have even heard of this, instead being exposed only to the alternative ""4-shot"" theory.  Here we are sure there were at least 4 shots and likely a fifth.  It isn't concretely proven nor is hoisted upon us as absolute fact, but it is given a proper scientific basis...I like this kind of journalism as it doesn't insult, but enlightens.  Many, not all, of the strange facts that have taken on various wild beliefs are also looked at with some having merit and others simply being highly dubious.  Perhaps the most interesting parts here that do have tremendous weight toward a clearer picture is the fact JKF's body never received a proper post-mortum autopsy and the one that was produced would be highly suspcious for a vagrant let alone the leader of the free world.  Amazing!  It is almost a certainty that x-ray records were actually created using the ""Photoshop"" technology of the day which being somewhat crude made it easy to spot and impossible to refute.  What is clear is that it almost a certainty beyond reasonable doubt that JFK received the mortal wound from the front, thus insuring the assissination was, indeed, a conspiracy.  There is an air of the absurd in the still sealed records revealed that when the few are given limited access they find absolutely no original documents, instead only copies.  Where are the originals and why were they all removed in favor of supposed copies?  This is the President of the United States we're talking about and things should be above question, however they only bring a much darker mysterious feel which makes one believe no matter what the real truth is it can never be concretely arrived upon.  Almost all of what is considered crucial forensic evendence was tainted, lost, or destroyed.  Was this on purpose?  How can one think anything but as the most common homicides receive much better handling.

This film is modestly budgeted yet rises above that limitation as it is clear in objective:  JFK's assination was a conspiracy based on available evidence and it will be next to impossible to ever actually know those directly responsible.  To support this the goverment reopened its own investigation on our behalf and found that to be true.  That later 70's investigation refuted the original Warren Commission Report, yet strangely that is still officially accepted even while this report carries the same weight of being an ""official"" finding.  These are facts and in the end that is what I like about this modest film.  This film doesn't push any agenda rather it justs cast the light of day on cold hard facts that must force one to believe we've all been lied to by our own government.  Some powerful parties stole the better day we were heading toward with JFK's enlightened, more balanced, view of how the U.S. should fit into the world around us as well as at home.  This must of threatened the industrial war machine that Eisenhower warned us would co-op our nation if not vigorously scrutinized in order that it be kept under control.  In fact, as of 2013 it easy to see where this fateful day has led our country.  We are ridiculously in debt even as our government pushes that so-called industial war complex to the point of not creating strength, but our downfall economically and otherwise.  See this film and reclaim the American Dream that Kennedy believed in.  One man couldn't do it as the dark day in Dallas proves, but together as a nation we still have a chance.  Everyone should watch this and wake-up to the fact that whatever group enacted the events on November 22nd, 1963 is still working our government to their dark purpose.  At the end of the day this film is a revelation and a call for justice in our time on a much bigger scale than even the world changing events shown here. Only your opinion matters and Reclaiming History:  The Assissination of JFK is worth a look.",1354924800,,4954,4.733100233100233
8289242,4,B001CU5TE4,"Bill Kirtis from American Justice did his usually good job in narrating this JFK assasination documentry. He was objective in his presentation of the evidence. The most interesting was how modern tech was used to clean up and restore the Dallas Police Dictabelt recording,from the stuck microphone on the police motorcycle,which indicates there were at least 5 shots fired. Then anyone would have to wonder why the Secrete Service Agents would wash down and clean up the blood spatter in the Presidents Limo? Blood splatter pattern had it remained could have provided evidence of the direction and angle of all the shots,so were they attempting to cover up something? I also found it to be alittle suspect,when the FBI agent present at JFK's autopsy ripped the film from from the medical examiners assistants camera,which makes the final autopsy results questionable?",1310256000,,867,5.2
8289243,4,B001CU5TE4,"Although this subject is getting dated and young people really know very little about it, many of us who were around at the time have problems with the official line of what really happened in Dealey Plaza in 1963. Bill Kurtis does a very good job of looking at some of the main controversial issues remaining - the number of shots fired, the magic bullet theory, the puzzling autopsy records given to the Kennedy family and the conspiracy theories. Bill Kurtis seems to be one of the most believable journalists on TV, to me anyway. He doesn't skip past any issue quickly, but takes the time to analyze it in depth. He also seeks opposing views and never relies on one expert only, if possible.

He reveals in this video that an acoustic study sponsored by the US government over a decade after the assassination found that there must have been more than 3 shots fired - they said 4.  This was largely based on a recording of a motorcycle radio which was stuck in the ""on"" position during the shooting. In fact, Kurtis's acoustic expert says there were 5 shots. How many people know that both the Warren Commission and this acoustic study were both accepted by the US Government, even though they disagree on the number of shots fired and therefore whether a conspiracy was involved?!

As the dust settles, Kurtis answers some questions and opens up other issues, like the skull X-ray that seems to show solid bone instead of a hole in the skull. Was it altered?
We may never know what actually happened that day, but Bill Kurtis has done his best to shine some light on this dark corner of history.",1254700800,10,1600,4.56794425087108
