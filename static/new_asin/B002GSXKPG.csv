3925688,5,B002GSXKPG,This set will zap you right back to a time when Steve Guttenberg was hands down the biggest star in the world. His four best movies are all here.,1260403200,,145,4.0344827586206895
3925689,4,B002GSXKPG,"The first two reviews are correct:  the version of the first film is the out of print fullscreen edition without the extras.  However, the rest are the same as the released versions, along with Police Academy 4 still being (bafflingly so) a fullscreen version.",1253750400,10,260,4.886363636363637
3925690,4,B002GSXKPG,"Years ago I used to own the Police Academy box set but had to sell the darn thing as I was a broke college student (those were sad years). The Police Academy films were never art but I enjoyed them for what they were - dumb comedies with fun characters. Now I am happy again because Warner Bros re-released the Police Academy films in 2 separate value packs (The first four are available in this collection called ""4 Film Favorites: Police Academy 1-4 Collection"" and the last three are in the set ""4 Film Favorites: Cop Comedy Collection"" packaged with Loaded Weapon 1). The packaging of these value packs isn't nearly as cool as the original releases (despite the dreaded snap cases) but overall the price for these collections is unbeatable.

All four films are presented on 2 double sided discs. I don't like double sided discs as they are easy to damage but then again the price makes me forgive this. Be warned though as the top of the second disc can come with some scuffs because the drawer the first disc sits on rubs against the top of the second disc.

Warner Bros did screw up on the details on the back. The back states that Police Academy 1 is in 16X9 widescreen and is loaded with special features -  the same as the special edition release. This is not true. The edition they used for this DVD set is the original out-of-print full screen edition. This didn't upset me too bad because some of the sequels are also only available in full screen...however this screw up could make a lot of buyers mad. You have been warned. This isn't the first time Warner has screwed up on the details on the cover art. The Dirty Dozen/Kelly's Heroes double feature proclaimed Dirty Dozen was anamorphic. It wasn't. The 4 Film Favorites: Martial Arts release proclaimed the films were full screen and on double sided discs. They were actually widescreen and on single sided discs (for once a mistake in the favor of the purchaser!). For people who need to know Parts 2 and 3 are anamorphic widescreen and Part 4 is Full Screen.

There you go, Police Academy 1 ISN'T widescreen as proclaimed on the box and the discs are double sided....but for the price one can't beat this collection. Make sure you pick up the second set to complete the series!",1253491200,60,2245,4.5495049504950495

3925697,5,B002GSXKPG,"There's not a lot to say to sway people in this day and age. If you grew up in the 80's Police Academy was an absolute comedy staple and will always be a cult classic to those of the era. Much of the content would never fly in today's PC world but back then people actually had a sense of humor. There's racism, sexism, but at the same time making fun of every stereotype of every culture you can think of including white. Just check it out and laugh your ass off.",1502755200,,464,4.054347826086956

3925700,4,B002GSXKPG,The movies were a trip down memory lane to have seen again.....Loved them then loved them now..  It has been a long while since these had last appeared . The packaging for the movies themselves is that of the discs are stacked one on top of another on a single spindle. Over time the discs could get scratched at some point from having to stack them the only other tiny thing I would mention about the discs themselves...is...The first two movies each have their own disc... Police Academy 3 and 4 share the same disc one has to flip them over...which is rather odd...and the titles are in tiny print in the center of the disc...I took off one star because of how this was packaged...,1501372800,,684,4.428571428571429

I think I got a different version than most people. My set is 3 discs. The first movie is the 20th anniversary version in widescreen and with extras. Appearently, when the first set came out, it was full screen and had no extras. The set was one disc with two movies on each side. Then, the set was two discs with one movie on each side. Now, this set seems to be three discs. The first two movies are on their own discs, the second two on one disc.

3925838,4,B002GSXKPG,I laughed over and over again.  This brought back memories of when I first saw these movies.  I still think police academy 4 is the funniest ever.  Part 5 was good also.,1400284800,,169,4.21875

3925841,3,B002GSXKPG,I was very happy to find this 4 movie pack.the dvd quality is fine what I didn't like is it read as if the movies were on separate disc.this isn't the case they are only on 3 dvds.very dissappointed,1399507200,,198,4.102564102564102

There really is not much in the way of extra features, but the quality of the picture was good on a 42'' Smart TV.  I was worried it would be really grainy.  It is not high-def, but it still works well on a larger screen.  Despite being cheap, I recommend this version if you are just interested in the movies without a lot of extras.",1399075200,,418,4.1234567901234565

It features Police Academy 1 through 4 which is perfectly because 5, 6, and 7 got progressively worse with each installment.

3925847,4,B002GSXKPG,I don't know about you but life today for me is a daily struggle. Movies are supposed to be an escape. a relief. Well these are as funny as they come. Especially 1 & 2. But you get all 4 for the price of 1. That's a lot of laughing. Especially funny at parties on the big screen.,1393718400,,279,3.8275862068965516

3925853,5,B002GSXKPG,I was always a big fan of the Police Academy movies. I had them on vhs but they started wearing out on me. When I saw this set I couldn't help myself. I had to get it. My favorites will alwasy be Tackleberry & Hightower.,1381449600,,220,3.911111111111111

3925857,3,B002GSXKPG,"You get the first 4 Police Academy movies in this set. The remaining three Police Academy sequels are available in another collection but they aren't quite as good (Steve Guttenberg is notably absent). This value pack is priced right for these great comedies. The extras are very light. One major complaint is that the back cover product description is false. The original movie and the fourth entry are both 4x3 ratio, not 16x9 widescreen as described here. I give the films 3.5 stars but this set gets 3 stars.

3925889,4,B002GSXKPG,"It was a surprise to get the 4 police academy films in one package, double sided discs were certainly OK at the price point.

The package was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.

The movies themselves, it was actually a treat to watch this cornball humour again after so many years, and to have the ability to watch them with the kids is great.

The humour, the sets, the quality of the storyboards is all very much 1980's. The parts of the discs that had extra features or voiceovers were a nice bonus aroun a $10 price point.

The slapstick is almost completely without gore, the language reasonably clean and I had no trouble leaving them lying around for general viewing.
Even today's kids seem to enjoy this humor, though that statement certainly won't apply to everyone.

If this set doesn't make you laugh and feel better, maybe you should see a doctor because something is wrong with you.  Wonderful medicine!!",1292025600,,416,4.32051282051282
3925894,4,B002GSXKPG,"Ok, these films are a guilty pleasure.
They made TOO MANY OF THEM.
This DVD package has the 1st four of the films.

I remember when the 1st film came out.
All of the films are funny, of course the 1st film the 1 that started it all is the best.

You see how many of the characters come & go in the film series.

It is good in this 2 disc collection that all four of the films have an extra ""Making of"" special.

But, here is what I DO NOT understand.

The 1st 3 films are wide screen but 4 Citizens on Patrol IS FULL SCREEN.  Can anyone explain this?

4th film notable for return of G. W. Bailey as Harris.  And both David Space & Sharon Stone in early film roles.

2cd film has ""WKRP's"" Howard Hesseman.  His only appearance in the series

And, of course, the big huge problem I keep complaining about in reviews.  It come in these HORRIBLE, CHEAP PLASTIC CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  These things are horrible & DVD's can be damaged.",1287187200,,949,4.148351648351649

3925896,3,B002GSXKPG,"This DVD set contains the first four movies, arguably the best four, of the POLICE ACADEMY series.  Once Steve Guttenberg left the franchise the following movies were of a direct-to-video quality.  The original POLICE ADADEMY is now a classic.  There are some truly funny bits in this film. Michael Winslow was at his freshest and funniest.  The trailing three films were okay, but for the most part they were repackaged versions of the first film.

This specific collection is a very economical way to collect the original four movies.  So my bottom line is that it is well worth the nominal price, under $10 in some stores, to pick up a copy.  It certainly allowed me to finally dispatch my VHS copies.

As noted in other reviews this collection has a few nitpicky drawbacks:  These are double sided DVDs which are awkward to handle and more prone to scratches.  The picture quality is superior to that of the VHS versions, but not quite the digitally remastered product we have come to expect in this day and age.  Finally only two of the movies are presented in widescreen.  Whether the lack of widescreen was intentional or not is anyone's guess.

This DVD set is a great value if you enjoy the POLICE ACADEMY movies, but are not an absolute die hard fan.",1273190400,8,1260,4.647058823529412
3925897,4,B002GSXKPG,This is a great collection and a must have for anyone collecting 80s cult classics. Definitely not a motion picture masterpiece but very enjoyable to watch. I hadn't seen them since I was a little boy but the gags still made me laugh.,1272412800,,234,4.465116279069767

### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's ""4 Film Favorites"" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The ""4 Film Favorites"" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.
