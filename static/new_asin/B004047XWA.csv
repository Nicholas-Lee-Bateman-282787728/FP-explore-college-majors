8411869,4,B004047XWA,"Okay I just Got done these DVDS a few hours ago and I must say though they were good, they weren't quite on par with the other ones. Their storylines weren't as dramatic or as dark or morbid as the others it was much more normal. It has a few new characters in this like a new straw named Yamawaro, a girl named Yuzuki who is the main character with Ai. And Akie her friend. Also Tsugumi makes an appearance from the first Season of Hell Girl though she is a woman now, also you learn about what happened to Hajime and will get Yuzuki and Yamawaro's past.

Kikuri is also still with the group. Anyway the story was to me a bit more confusing at times. However dispite its faults I would still recommend it as the series as a whole is just great and this one was great as well.",1299024000,6,776,4.105263157894737
