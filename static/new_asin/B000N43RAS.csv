8174659,5,B000N43RAS,"Its a very old series which was once broadcasted on nation TV. Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan, a iconic figure and a classical Urdu and Persian poet from the Indian subcontinent during British colonial rule. Ghalib was a very liberal mystic who believed that the search for God within liberated the seeker from the narrowly Orthodox Islam, encouraging the devotee to look beyond the letter of the law to its narrow essence. His Sufi views and mysticism is greatly reflected in his poems and ghazals.
As he once stated:
""The object of my worship lies beyond perception's reach;
For men who see, the Ka'aba is a compass, nothing more.""

I just love Ghalib for immense talent he possessed and his ease to express the most complex thought in so interesting and Ghalib way. A gem for anyone who appreciates him and his work.",1308614400,3,814,4.732394366197183
