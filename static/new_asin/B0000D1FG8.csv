7999949,4,B0000D1FG8,"been looking for this, oh yes I remember this movie well, I actually saw it on tv in the 60s when I was in jr high school. I lived in minneapolis and at that time there was this big business man; Mel Jazz who had an afternoon tv show; ""mel jazz matinee movies 1:pm everyweekday on channel 11 (any minnesotans out there?) he showed this movie (uncut) one afternoon when I was home from school, made my day, hahaha. haven't seen it anywhere since.",1383955200,,445,4.309523809523809

7999951,3,B0000D1FG8,saw this movie  some 50 years ago. now a lot older and hopefully wiser i was diappointed this time around. the movie spent more time in germany than the the jungle. the cameraman took a lot of film of animals to give the impression all the film was shot in the outdoors of africa.so we never got to see why lianne was a goddess.  regards  ken,1235260800,,342,4.151515151515151
7999952,1,B0000D1FG8,"This movie was kind of wierd but the main reason why I decided to purchase it was because my favorite actor gorgeous blonde heart throb Hardy Kruger was the main male character in it. I liked him and his charming, romantic role that he played but other than that Liane was typically boring and hardly spoke and there really wasn't any major suspense to this flick. Everything happened just too suddenly and fast paced. True, the picture quality was horrible in some scenes. I'd only watch this to see  Hardy Kruger but not really because of the story. Dull, boring story, but it had the most gorgeous man alive in it, Hardy Kruger.",1234742400,,631,4.584070796460177
7999953,2,B0000D1FG8,"A no-budget German girlie-Tarzan pot boiler, this is the kind of movie where your mind wanders and you find yourself focusing on various peripheral subjects: Why do the topless African dancing girls look so bored? Was that bit of dialog actually written, or was it just made up by the dubbing actor on the spur of the moment (""uh-oh, his lips are moving; I'd better say something"")? How did they get Marion Michaels' hair to ""just happen"" to fall in front of her chest*  in most (but not all!) of her topless scenes? (did they use rubber cement? double-sided tape?) How old was Michaels, anyway? And goodness, didn't they have nice looking streetcars in 1959 Hamburg?

Obviously, this movie's sole excuse for existing was to present as much as the censors would allow of the lovely and nubile Marion Michaels to a prurient audience. And if the video quality weren't so bad, and if they didn't go and put clothes on her about one third through the film, and if it weren't for that darn rubber cement, I would have been quite happily and appreciatively prurient myself. As it is, it's still a bit of a hoot to watch, and Michaels truly is lovely and nubile, and those Hamburg streetcars really are nice!

*Can you believe that Amazon won't let you use the 'B' word that rhymes with ""chest"" in a review!?!",1106352000,33,1302,4.603448275862069
