7119529,3,B00W3W2TC0,Average science fiction action movie with a below average ending.,1431388800,2,65,5.6
7119530,5,B00W3W2TC0,"This was a great sci-fi ""Indie"" I felt. I believe they did an excellent job with their budget and got the point across. One previous review references several sci-fi horrors to its depoictive character such as; Prometheus, Event Horizon, and Aliens...And I agree with that and the fact its no where near those multi million dollar production values, but again they did an excellent job with the budget they did have. If your a real sic-fi buff you'll get this reference :) I felt that this was like Space Above and Beyond but with great acting and better cinematography, costume design, and thought provoking plot. I enjoyed the play on humanities less attractive attributes and the extraterrestrial life forms using it in an attempt to understand us. I hope this review gives the curious interested person(s) the urge to watch it. Trust that you will enjoy this awesome horror sci-fi film.",1431388800,,890,4.900662251655629
7119531,3,B00W3W2TC0,"I've read other reviews on this Australian film... they vary across the board, and I can understand why. Infini, brought to us from the same director as Gabriel (a movie that I enjoyed), offers a mixed-bag for the true Sci-fi fan, even allowing for the horror crossover.

Start by imagining a very low budget borrowing of bits from Event Horizon, The Thing, Aliens, and Prometheus... now don't get super excited, because the reality of Infini is nowhere near the level of these films. Take insanity and gore from EH, a mimicking viral life-form from The Thing, alien stuff coming out of you and steam venting industrial corridors (that seem repetitive) from Aliens, and contagion from Prometheus... and you get the idea. However, while there were some good moments, overall, the patchwork quilt falls short here.

For example, as far as the cinematography, the scenery is generally low value. There were no sweeping shots of futuristic settings, dystopian cities (one balcony view really didn't do it) or of the mining facility where the action occurs. Much of the camera work is close quarters on the actors. From a positive, that style can highlight the feeling of claustrophobic psychological unease that the characters are experiencing, but it also leaves the Sci-fi background as a weak suggestion, and that makes it hard to suspend disbelief. Also, when you are listening to multiple character conversations at once, or seeing multiple action viewpoint shifts between characters that may or may not be what is really happening, it's a tad confusing. I can appreciate thrusting that feeling upon the viewer to empathize with what the characters are suffering, but it also makes things difficult to piece together.

The writing was also a mixed bag. For example, the idea of people slipstreaming across the universe via being compiled into data that is beamed anywhere and then reassembled... well, that's pretty cool. But the details behind this are woefully unexplored, as is the background history of the 23rd century Earth beyond a sentence or two in the opening. We also have too many writing hiccups such as people that are represented as an elite military search and rescue team, but like a bad deja vu of Prometheus, they come off as amateurs even in the face of knowing that there is a biological contagion that might be airborne. Sure enough, the order of the day is don't touch anything, but then helmets are taken off almost immediately! There are several other instances of amateur hour and things that make no sense, but again, I'm not going into spoilers. Also, the dialogue in the middle portion of the movie descends into cursing - f this, f-that, f... which lost it's value and my patience fairly quickly. I understand the reasons, but still, less would have been more. Instead, perhaps the energy would have been better spent on character development, as we learn very little that would enable us to identify with the characters beyond a concept of sacrifice for family. With the exception of Daniel MacPherson who plays the leading character of Whit Carmichael, and Luke Ford as Chester Huntington, I found it really challenging to care about what happens to the other characters.

The final segment of the movie has redeeming aspects and delves into more interesting ground. I feel as though there are two interpretations of the ending. One hopeful, and one dire... it's really hard to decide which one is in play, so it's up to the viewer to make that call. I'm fine with that... and for me, this elevated the movie, but not enough to erase the remaining weakness.

Parental Advisory: No sex, or nudity, but the violence, gore and cursing put this squarely in the ""R"" rating. Also, I think this one is more challenging to understand for teenage children and adults that haven't been exposed to a lot of science fiction/horror.

Overall, I like my Sci-fi films to have a tighter weave, whether a ""B"" flick, cult classic or ""A"" level offering. Although this one drags in the middle, I see it as worth the rental once. On my independent film scale (this means lower your expectations) - Infini manages to hit 2.5 out of 5, so I'll round it up to 3 for Amazon.",1431302400,36,4182,4.858345021037868
7119532,1,B00W3W2TC0,"Truly the worst movie I've seen this year, and in the top three for worst ever. The plot, if it had one, was so lost in the blood and guts I gave up trying to find it.  If you want to watch a bunch of people screaming all the time, go for it.  Otherwise. This is a real money-waster.",1431216000,4,283,3.7796610169491527
7119533,4,B00W3W2TC0,"A little hard to follow but very interesting; the plot does jump a bit and leaves a lot to interpretation and assumption. I haven't seen anything like it, but I also normally avoid anything ""scary"" so I haven't seen Prometheus, which other reviewers said this reminded them of. That being said, it is more of an action-thriller than a sci-fi. I'd like to see a sequel, or even a prequel because this world seems like something I'd enjoy learning more about. The acting was impressive and the character ranges shown were extensive. The graphics are simple but beautiful, they don't ""stand out"" as being computer generated. I definitely suggest this for rental.",1431216000,3,659,4.892857142857143
7119534,3,B00W3W2TC0,"An above-average ""bug hunt"" sci-fi actioneer, with a great cast and terrific visuals. Infini borrows from familiar sources (Event Horizon, Alien, Prometheus), but it still manages to have a voice all its own. Apart from some weird plot snafus and an overabundance of red herrings, I found this to be a very fun weekend rental, and I would love to see a sequel or continuation of the story.",1431129600,3,389,4.735294117647059

I will not go into detail about the plot in order to avoid spoilers, but I'll say that the acting is terrific, the action is convincing, the FX work is superb for the budget, and the plot is the strongest point.

7119573,4,B00W3W2TC0,"Set on a distant future earth, 'Infini' tells the story of a rescue mission to to an outlying off-world mining station, what the party meet when they arrive, and how the situation progresses. Yes, it's been done before but the 'monsters' are different and the resolution was not what I expected. This is an Australian production but you would not know (ie. the characters do not use Australian accents). Considering the film was shot on a small budget it is very impressive in scale and in the detail used in the costumes and on the sets. The acting is also impressive. I bought my copy here in Australia and we are able to purchase on Blu-ray - this really is a must as you can see all the detail and textures and it has a cracking DTS HD-MA soundtrack. I'm sure the DVD would be a disappointment in these areas. I'll admit that the story can be difficult to follow but I'm sure I will work through this and enjoy it again as it's definitely on my rewatch list.",1451088000,,962,4.379888268156424

I still haven't all of Plan-9. I'll probably make it all the way through that movie before I can get through ""Infini"".",1442880000,,255,4.425531914893617
7119584,5,B00W3W2TC0,A complex and meaningful yarn.  I watched it twice.,1442620800,,51,4.666666666666667
7119585,2,B00W3W2TC0,"Imagine the slow kid sitting near the back of the every class. You know, the kid who just can't get his head around even fairly simple concepts like commutative and non-commutative equations. Now imagine this kid grows up and for reasons no one can ever determine, he's allowed to write faux sci-fi scripts and, even more incredible, one actually gets green lit.

Sadly this movie isn't as funny as Plan 9 From Outer Space. The production values are a little higher, though not by much. Apparently two hundred years from now we'll still be looking at 1980s computer graphics and people will have iPhones strapped to their forearms. And plastic guns will be very large and very much in vogue. The plot... well, let's just say that it's pretty obvious no one stayed up late sweating the details.

The best thing about this movie is that it can be used by teachers. If you remember the ""what's wrong with this picture"" games from the 1960s then you'll get the idea. All the ""science"" in this movie is so hilariously wrong (remember the kid sitting in the back of the class and not being able to grasp even simple concepts) that it would be a great pedagogical aid. Although I was mostly focused on avoiding self-harm during this movie I did manage to note that every single ""scientific"" idea was hopelessly wrong, so much so that any educated ten-year-old could play ""spot what's wrong with this"" and be right every time. A few examples out of far too many: time dilation occurs when one object is moving at relativistic speeds compared to the reference object; it doesn't occur once you reach your destination and stop moving. ASCII isn't a programming language, it's a character-encoding scheme. Computer code isn't a bunch of two-integer numbers in a cube, it's always language-like unless you're in assembler (less language like, but still with syntax) or binary. And if you render someone into a data stream you're (a) killing them, and (b) not moving them across the galaxy faster than the speed of light, so travel to far distant reaches would take thousands of years, not a second or two.

I could go on, but you get the idea. The kid who wrote this script thought that complicated words would be enough for the audience and no one would really notice how totally messed up everything is. Which is true so long as the audience comprises turtles and other marine creatures who've led a sheltered existence up until now.

In the end it's difficult to know why anyone assigned a budget to this movie. There's no plot, there's no characterization, there's no human interest, there's no science, there's no anything. Just tedium and hilariously poor acting - it's as if the cast were vying for Razzie nominations in a desperate attempt to remain awake long enough to complete the film. There's simply nothing good to say about this movie aside from the point above, that it provides teachers with a great example of nonsense masquerading as ""science.""",1442534400,,2951,4.76908023483366

(1). The F-word is used frequently, perhaps once every three minutes.  Also, the characters say ""sh--"" from time to time. (The word for doo-doo.)
(2). All of the scenes are very dark and under low lighting conditions.  Also, all the characters wear space suits that look like black leather.

There have also been soooo many terrible sci fi films. This film Infini is better than watchable, and at times very very good. The main actors give solid performances, there's a little action and plenty of tension. The director did an admirable job, although there are too many characters on the rescue team and it's difficult to keep them straight. I watch plenty of films as a college film professor - it's not impossible to shoot a big ensemble of characters and have no issue identifying them, even the ones with little to say. Part of the problem here, I believe, was casting multiple actors that look alike. The other part is identifying them for their individual ""thing"" - be it personality or function or some identifying wardrobe or prop. The director did some nice segments (like the ones with the pregnant wife) that are beautifully shot and edited in a way that pertains to the themes of time and memory. Finally, I really liked the creative idea of the insidious antagonist.  Can't say more about that without spoiling the aha moments.",1438732800,,1196,4.777777777777778

It is set in in what seems like factory basements and labs making it quite atmospheric.

7119706,5,B00W3W2TC0,"We all know Science Fiction is just as cool as Horror but suffers from the long founded belief that the science part needs to make sense, be smart, and not take too many liberties with science in general.
I disagree. A good movie is a good movie regardless of what genre its tackling, and what makes a movie good you ask? Well of course I'm going to tell you.
Good Writing.
Good Acting.
Interesting (not necessarily original) concept.
Worldbuilding.
Invoking a Sense of Wonder.
Good Directing.
Infini came as a complete surprise because it hits the mark in everyone of the categories. Whats even more surprising is the movie was written and directed by a relatively new filmmaker named Shane Abbess out of Australia. If this is the caliber of movie hes going to provide everytime then hes won over a fan for life.
Infini takes place in the 23rd century, or thereabouts, and follows a search and rescue team who are sent to investigate a disturbance (thats putting it mildly) at a mining colony on the further edge of the galaxy. The disturbance being a biological outbreak of some kind. Body horror in space never gets old.
The movie begins like gangbusters, setting tension right from the get-go and not letting up on the gas for quite sometime. If you enjoy movies that throw you right into the world and let you try and figure out what's going on you'll enjoy this one. Its not until the midway point that the movie slows down and begins its close examination of what exactly is going on and why.
The writing in this film is super tight, crafted with the right amount of detail and a cadence that makes everyone of the characters feel natural. Abbess writes much like Aaron Sorkin, with a rhythm and feel for words. Of course great writing means little if the acting isn't up to snuff, but in this case its excellent. The troupe of actors, each with their own style and personalities, handle the material deftly and never once did it feel like any of them were trying to fit into the scenes. Daniel MacPherson does the heavy lifting as the main protagonist and is excellent throughout. Coupled with an exceptionally awesome and creepy performance by Luke Ford the cast nails it across the board.
[soliloquy id=""1040""]
On to the concept! Its very cool. Humans can travel across the galaxy via whats called Slipstreaming - being digitized and sent via data packets. Its dangerous therefore highly controversial, but useful due to the timelines involved. Relativity can be your friend. Ever see Interstellar.
Hardcore fans will probably rip the science part...well..apart...but as a layman I found it worked. Science Fiction can get bogged down in tropes, and doubly so in trying to explain all the little super-science nuance and rules for how futuristic technology work. Infini does it right by not trying to justify itself. The movie establishes the rules and moves on. A few times, when necessary to the story, a rule is explained in detail or another aspect of travel is revealed but its always to advance the story, never to try and cheat the story.
Abbess also adds a nice touch by way of the environment. The mining colony isn't just there for looks. The environment is extremely hostile and Abbess never takes it for granted ensuring it plays a huge role throughout the story.
One area I can see the film catching some flak - the midway point onward. The speed of the movie slows down and the tone moves more from an action vibe to a more metaphysical thriller. Thats not to say the movie gets any less bloody, gory or violent. Hell no, it keep right on with the dark tone.
The ending I found fascinating. Its probably going to be a divisive topic for the viewers but it works if you take the entirety of the film into account. It also has a beautifully done finale that slow boils the tension to critical levels without a lot of over the top set pieces or action sequences.
Infini is a fantastic addition to the sci-fi horror genre and Shane Abbess is going to be a writer/director to keep an eye on.",1432857600,2,4010,4.641350210970464
7119707,4,B00W3W2TC0,"This is a very great sic-fi film for the indie crowd. Its very minimal sets and characters, but the action and stakes keep raising as the film continues on.

Its about 15 minutes too long, and the end may lose some people, but I liked the direction it went, and think that it worked for the world that they created.

7119709,3,B00W3W2TC0,"The acting was good.  The set was believable.  The story was original.  The story is about a planet with a space station and centers around a squad of soldiers that do their patriotic chore for money in a future where most everyone is poor.  Distant space travel is accomplished with dangerous transporters assisted with spinal implants on people.  Some time travel (not much) happens around black holes. Our main character ""Whit Carmichael"" (Daniel MacPherson) has a pregnant wife and wants to go home, but he is stuck at a mining station after a failed investigation left his crew murdered under strange circumstances.  The second squad is sent to rescue Whit, (who just wants to go home) and also to stop the mining colony shipment set for transportation to earth.  The scientists on earth realize that the shipment is lethal by this point.  The squad arrives at the station all safe and sound before (you guessed it) all hell breaks loose. Parts of the chaos that ensues also affects the camera operator a bit as our director (Shane Abbess) conveys the feelings of the crew for we viewers. Luke  Hemsworth is in this movie, causing me to realize that his mommy and daddy has a lot of boys that like to act, like the Baldwin patriarch.  There are fights, there is death.  We are pretty sure aliens are involved.  If you like Science Fiction, and your girlfriend likes Hemsworths; go ahead and buy or rent this to see if Whit makes it home.

For a movie that's supposed to be filmed in the future, it looked like it was filmed in an abandoned Bulgarian tank factory.  Lots of steam, large fan blades... and an alien presence that consisted of some translucent goo.  The acting was mostly a lot of fake intensity/fighting and yelling plus the F word.

I'd love to put a spoiler alert here on  how they managed to stop the conveyor belt that had the alien weapon, but I won't. Too bad because it was insanely dumb.

7119713,4,B00W3W2TC0,"I was pleasantly surprised by Infini; it's a pretty slick low-budget film.  Although it borrows heavily from existing sci fi movies, e.g. Aliens, The Thing, Event Horizon, etc.., the storyline is engaging.  Some minor quibbles; a) I had trouble understanding some of the characters due to their thick Aussie accents, and b) the middle section drags a bit.

When I first watched Infini, I was greatly confused by the beginning sequence.  I'll explain it below (**NOTE, SPOILERS FOLLOW**).  Key to understanding the beginning is paying attention when a few background characters talk about time dilation.

1) Captain Johanson's squad slipstreams back to the East Coast Command HQ.  They're held under quarantine while being questioned about outbreak exposure.  This same scene is repeated at the end of the movie, after we follow the squad's linear adventures on Infini.  The storyline is like one giant flashback.

2) Whit on his first day of work at the West Coast Division.  Stuff starts to hit the fan when a random squad slipstreams into Infini, spends some time there (recall time dilation), and returns infected.  The West Coast Division Captain orders a random jump ""dirty jump"" which happens to be to Infini.  Whit and his buddy, Pontner, dirty jump, but the Captain is left behind because Pontner is unable to reprogram his APEX unit due to insufficient security clearance.

3) At East Coast Division HQ, they learn of the demise of the West Coast Division.  The chief briefs Captain Johanson's squad and sends them to Infini.  Then the rest of the movie unfolds in linear fashion on Infini.",1432080000,10,1599,5.022813688212928

In the 23rd century, the world has developed teleportation they call ""slip streaming"" a title already taken. There are risks associated with slip streaming as sometimes the molecules don't come back together correctly. This fact creates an alternative explanation for the events, similar to ""Total Recall.""

An event happens on the remotest location ""Infini"" which causes his operation on earth to be quarantined and destroyed. Whit manages to slip stream to Infini, the source of the problem. A rescue team shows up and find Infini shutdown and dead bodies all over the place.

There appears to be an infection which causes people to kill. We discover (Plot spoiler part) they were mining frozen primordial ooze, a living organic rock which acts like a parasite and causes the host to go into predator mode, killing other people. Unfortunately much of the film is devoted to people in the predator mode hunting each other at Infini, which became boring after a while.

It seems Infini, like every nearly planet and moon in science fiction has the exact same gravity as Earth.  They can send extraction signals from Infini to Earth, send people between the two locations, but are unable to send messages. The dialogue and acting was stiff, a characteristic of too many sci-fi books and films that concentrate on plot.  Science fiction fans should like this film whereas casual sci-fi viewers might get bored.

7119723,2,B00W3W2TC0,"""Infini"" has terrible acting, with a couple minor exceptions.

Plot and script are pretty awful and poorly thought out.

The chubby red head fellow actually made me laugh several times,
some of his lines were quite amusing and I hope that was the intention.

The plastic gun the lead carried was hilarious, it was easy to see it had
no weight by they way they handled it and you never saw the gun fire.

The ending was an utter stinker.

If you like low budget B grade movies with terrible nonsense stories, bad acting
and a horrific script then ""Infini"" is right up your alley !!

7119728,3,B00W3W2TC0,"""By the turn of the 23rd century, 95% of the world lives on or below the poverty line."" While this sounds like an appetizing start to a dystopian adventure, Infini doesn't make much hay out of it other than to ""explain"" why the characters would risk their lives to do what you will see next.

In trying to appeal to as diverse an audience as possible, Infini ends up as dissociative identity disorder film that jumbles different forms of entertainment: FPS video games plus sci-fi, zombie/horror, and action/thriller movies (no actual zombies here, but close enough). As such, it is not likely to fully satisfy fans of any of those, or folks who would prefer not to have their Butter Pecan mixed with their Rocky Road. Look at the artwork: planets, spacecraft, and people in space helmets. Sci-fi, right? That's why I watched. But as it turns out, the planets and spacecraft are really nowhere to be found.

After a promising beginning, Infini turns into people in a maze trying to kill each other, which works well in some video games and even some movies, but is overused here. I'm a sci-fi nut, but the horror genre is usually not my cup of tea: I thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine/dp/B000Y7U98W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine</a>&nbsp;was a grand flick until the bait and switch into Freddy Krueger at the end. Blood everywhere in Infini, if that's your thing. Also a ridiculous alpha male fight scene where the dudes should have been dead after about a minute but kept beating on each other so long that I almost had to laugh.

Why then not less than 3 stars? Because while Infini borrows too much and I am not a fan of ""bloody sci-fi,"" Infini was weird enough that it kept me wondering how it would end. Plus the acting was above par, which in my mind rescues this from being a B movie.",1431648000,2,1855,4.882539682539683

In a nutshell, this movie wasn't ""horrible,"" but it had absolutely nothing compelling and was utterly forgettable.  Which, in some ways, is worse than ""horrible"" because horrible movies tend to generate discussion - albeit negative - but a discussion none the less.

I liked the direction that was chosen to finish which was unexpected and kind of original and left you thinking, but would've liked a little more on the back end, as well as the front..

8711979,3,B00W3W2TC0,"This review is for the standard DVD version of 'Infini' released by Vertical Entertainment in 2015.

This is almost a very good movie. The problem is that it has problems. It's hard to go too much into detail without giving away major parts of the plot. So I'll just keep this fairly brief.

This is a low budget, but not super low, futuristic science fiction movie that takes place within our galaxy.
The story is basically about a team sent to the edge of the galaxy to rescue a soldier and prevent a madman from destroying earth. Except for the beginning and very end, the movie takes place primarily on a deep space mining station.

I immediately became confused about what was going on. I watched this movie without reading the box cover or any reviews. As a result, the second scene in the movie is pretty confusing. I had to immediately go online to figure out what was happening. It's not really all that complicated. It's just hard to understand without knowing what the basic premise is.

Once the team reaches the space station, things pick up. From here, I was still a little bit confused as to why some characters seemed to be affected more that others but eventually that is explained in the movie so you just have to be patient. The movie has a decent plot and I liked how the main character was depicted. He is supposed to be the hero of the story but his deeds are not always heroic. So what I'm saying is the main character has depth and has to make some hard choices. Choices that aren't black and white.

***MINOR SPOILER THIS PARAGRAPH***

Ultimately I was left a bit disappointed by the ending. It's not what you'd call a predictable ending, but it is definitely a classic 'Hollywood' ending if you get my drift. Without going into details, I'm also not a fan of intelligent life that comes from such a low life form, in this case...goo.

***END OF MINOR SPOILER***

Despite only giving this 3 stars, I'm recommending it for science fiction fans. Taking into consideration the budget, it really is more like a 4 star movie, so for arguments sake lets call it 3.5 stars or 7/10. If you more easily able to suspend disbelief than I (and even if you don't) then you will probably enjoy this movie.",1512518400,,2216,4.508728179551122

8711985,4,B00W3W2TC0,"As a big fan of the dystopian sci-fi genre, I am always willing to give some lesser known offerings a try.  I went into this film totally not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.

5 stars for the idea and overall theme...a dystopian future of the 23rd century where most of the world lives in poverty, but those brave enough can volunteer for dangerous duty working the mines, outposts, and search and rescue teams in interstellar space, to earn their living and escape poverty.  This is achieved through a sort of instantaneous digital transportation.  Pretty cool, and original enough.  Acting is solid, but not phenomenal, but taking into account there are no big names, or even moderately recognizable names in this movie, they pull it off well enough to deserve 4 stars, giving them extra credit for a solid effort despite little name value.  As for the character development and progression of the plot, it lacks in places, but is vastly superior to most other low budget offerings.  Its a solid 3 stars in that regard, enough to keep you interested, and enough to make you root for the protagonists, but leaves you wanting more character development, and more back story and explanation to this universe we are introduced to.  The conclusion is satisfying, and can actually be interpreted as happy or dark, depending on how you process the underlying plot elements, and the antagonists intentions.  Do they come around a find a conscience, or is there something more sinister lying beneath their actions?  That's for you to decide.

With elements of Alien, Sunshine, Omega Man, and Event Horizon, but not blatantly ripping off any one of them, it is a thrilling, dark, sci-fi adventure that explores the elements of dealing with an unknown hostile alien force, the hostility and brutality of the humans infected by this force, and the psychological and physical rigors of deep space missions.  I definitely recommend this movie to any fan of dystopian science fiction adventure/horror films.",1477267200,,2015,5.0
