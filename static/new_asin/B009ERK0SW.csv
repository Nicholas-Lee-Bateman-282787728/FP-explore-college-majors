5322681,3,B009ERK0SW,"The Keira Knightley film was OK, Anna Karenina is a classic, but the remaining films are not so great. The second disk was unbearably bad, especially The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers, Patterns and the corny Magic Sword. Pergatory to watch these. I threw it in the trash. Not worth the $4.99. Good fast shipping though.",1365120000,3,319,4.714285714285714

5322694,3,B009ERK0SW,"I was delighted to find this collection of new and old movies on Amazon.  However...some of the older selections were of very inferior quality and that was a big disapointment, I know they are older offerings...but I have seen them before and the quality was far superior to this offering.  The Keira Knightly movie was the exception.",1380672000,11,334,4.842105263157895
