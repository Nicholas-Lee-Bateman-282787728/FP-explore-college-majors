1862863,5,B00008W2TD,"For those who want to create more bone density, and tone, and get in cardio, without pounding the pavement on a hot or cold day, this is great for beginners.",1219536000,,157,4.266666666666667
1862864,4,B00008W2TD,"Likes - 2 options either 1 mile for 15 minutes or 2 miles for 30 minutes
Easy to follow along, and not strenous at all but you get a massive workout and everytime I am pouring sweat when I'm done, the 15 minute segment is slower so if you're not wanting a high calorie burn I'd suggest doing the 15 minute one, twice, the 30 minute one starts of with just basically walking in place, then it gets faster and faster but even at my weight I'm still able to keep up with them

Dislikes all her talking about the people walking with her, I honestly don't care how long they've been friends or if they're kids grew up together so that gets old pretty quick but I've learned to just tone her out and just follow the steps, I also dislike the whole ""waist band"" thing that 99% of the people in the workout are using, its an optional piece of equipment for the workout, I don't have one and would have liked to see more than 1 person not using it on the dvd, especially since that 1 person is male and about 60, Which I am in my 20's and female so it's not the same! So instead of the optional band I use my 1lb weights and get the same effect without the band",1199836800,5,1152,4.052631578947368
1862865,5,B00008W2TD,"I love this DVD... I have several of Leslie's others, but this one packs more of a punch to me. I do not have the belt, instead, I use the band (the one in the other videos) and on days I am up for more of a challenge, I hold the weights and use the band together. One particular thing you will notice on other videos is that the ""cool down"" period is included in you mile counting where as this video gets you up and going for the full two miles, once you have reached that there is a short cool down and stretching.  Using Leslie's videos, I have lost a total of 20 pounds in 2 short months, it couldn't be easier.",1179792000,12,616,3.967741935483871
1862866,5,B00008W2TD,"I have an old VHS Abs 2 mile walking tape I use ALL the time. I used it every day when I was pregnant with my 3rd child up until the day I delivered. It is low-impact to where you're not stretching or lifting things that would hurt yourself. After I delivered, I was back in my jeans a few days later and could start the tape sooner than walking on the sidewalk. I didn't have the belt, I just used small weights, 3-5 pounds, and it worked just as well. My arms were noticeably smaller within 2-3 weeks. It's great when you need to be on the go and can't go somewhere to exercise. It's quick and great for when the kids are napping!!! Great buy!!",1164931200,18,646,4.094488188976378
1862867,5,B00008W2TD,"I was recently diagniosed with type 2 diabetes and my Dr told me I needed to lose some weight. I tried walking at a nearby park but the summer heat just wore me out. So I ordered WATP for ABS. All I can say is WOW!! I never imagined I'd actually enjoy working out. Like the previous reviewer I use hand weights (1 lb) instead of the belt, and it seems to be doing the job for me. I started out doing the one mile...and it's a FAST one mile...before moving to the two mile. And believe me, you're gonna sweat doing this workout.

In just a few weeks this workout, in combination with diet, has given me more energy than I've had in years and I've already dropped a pant size!  I've been telling everyone about this DVD and hope to add Leslie's Walk & Kick to my collection soon.",1157241600,36,777,4.139072847682119
1862868,5,B00008W2TD,"I will have to agree and disagree with a previous reviewer. I do indeed LOVE this WATP for Abs series. However, I HATE the belt. I use hand weights, and think it adds quite an impact and intensity to the workout. The ide of the belt is resistance and core strength, which the weights provide equally well (better in my opinion). I have been using this series for over a year and will continue to do so!",1147910400,14,402,4.233766233766234

1862874,5,B00008W2TD,"Had this DVD before , it got scratched. So glad to find another one. Never seems like there's not enough time in the day . These 2 short workouts are great to get my workout in. One is 20 min. The other is 30 min. I can take 20 or 30 minutes a day for myself. I feel better after just a couple of workouts. I am 47, these workouts are easy but effective. Leslie is my favorite workout instructor.",1386979200,2,396,3.9625
1862875,4,B00008W2TD,have been through it once and am looking forward to using it  more often. Leslie is very motivating and encouraging and easy to follow.,1379980800,,135,4.625

1862880,5,B00008W2TD,"I love the Leslie Sansone exercise,they are easy to follow and if done faithfully like everything else it can give you great results. My daughter works out with several of the DVD's along with weight watcher and has lost inches and of course weight and of course I have lost inches and weight myself. I would recommend buying Leslie Sansone excercise DVD's...",1374019200,,359,4.806451612903226
1862881,2,B00008W2TD,I have many of Leslie's walk DVDs .  I am very happy to recommend her style of exercise.  This one was bland and boring.  I added a few of my own steps in order to feel I had done the kind of workout I would expect from Leslie.,1373328000,4,227,3.6875
1862882,4,B00008W2TD,this one is a good work out one because she does things a little different from her other DVDS  that I have already,1370563200,,115,4.0
1862883,4,B00008W2TD,this is a very good work out dvd because its different from her other DVD she has out and i also like the other ones she got out too,1370563200,,132,3.586206896551724
1862884,5,B00008W2TD,Love Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds for Abs for the 2 mile walk. I rotate the 2 mile and 3 mile workout. I just absolutely love her DVD's.,1370217600,,145,4.0344827586206895

It is an easy CD to follow, either 1 or 2 miles.",1369440000,,94,3.75
1862886,5,B00008W2TD,super workout thanks i love being able to do the workouts at home . nice to be able to use any time the time allows,1368144000,,115,3.64
1862887,5,B00008W2TD,Walking with Leslie makes shedding the pounds easier!  Fun parther to walk with!!  I walk with Leslie any day!  Yay!,1367280000,,116,4.7
1862888,4,B00008W2TD,"I bought this because I had the three-mile walk in this series.  It's obviously an older program and not as user friendly as Leslie's newer DVDs (you can't skip to sections but you can fast forward through them).  In the one-mile walk, she gives details on how to use the belt which I fast forward through.  The walk seems a bit more intense than some of her other walks and the two-mile walk works up a sweat even if you've been doing these walks for awhile.  I did like seeing the ""old"" regulars - Mary Kay, Linda, Joann, etc.",1367107200,,528,4.303030303030303
1862889,5,B00008W2TD,"I did the 2 mile workout as soon as I received my dvd in the mail. I used 3 lb hand weights.
I was surprised that I burned almost 250 calories in just 30 mins.
This is my new morning workout when I am limited on time.
I am very happy!",1366329600,,234,3.607843137254902
1862890,5,B00008W2TD,Amazing fast paced DVD.  You got to try it if you really want to work those abs! You will love it.  I walk this DVD with the 3 Mile Walk away the Pounds!  I recommend it highly!,1366070400,,177,3.72972972972973
1862891,5,B00008W2TD,"When you get home from work and don't want to get back out, Leslie's workout DVD's are a great way to stay in shape.",1363824000,,116,3.875
1862892,2,B00008W2TD,Not what I thought it would be. Very dissappointed. It is all the same as her other videos. Not worth it,1357344000,,104,4.0
1862893,1,B00008W2TD,Nothing different than all the her other video's. not worth buying. I can get it at a local dept store cheaper,1355184000,,110,4.285714285714286
1862894,4,B00008W2TD,I have been walking with leslie for a a while.  I also walk outdoors.  Since the weather was starting to become cold I decided to update my indoor walking videos.  I was surprised to see that leslie has added weights with her walk.  I use my 3 pound free weights with this video.  I just wish the video was a longer 4 mile walk!,1352851200,,328,4.0625
1862895,5,B00008W2TD,"Wow. Where do I start? A coworker gave me an extra copy of this dvd years ago and I still use it occasionally when I don't have time to do a more strenuous workout.

What really makes this DVD work for me is the unintentional comedy happening. First of all, it becomes quickly apparent in the video that the belt (which I never had the pleasure of owning) is not exactly, let's say....effective. The belt becomes loose on Leslie's long-time friends and at one point they're all holding onto it for dear life so it won't fall off, particularly the blonde woman in front of Wendy, the more it becomes loose and unwieldy, the more intensely she smiles.

Another unintentionally funny part about this video is the interaction between Leslie and her cohorts. Most notably when Lynn becomes obviously annoyed with Leslie repeatedly checking in with her, so much so that she totally messes up one of the moves since she's distracted. Talk about tension! The banter is delightfully awkward and makes me laugh every time.

Overall, a decent, easy to follow workout.",1328227200,3,1056,4.759562841530054
1862896,2,B00008W2TD,"I already had a dvd of ""Leslie Sansome-Walk the Pounds for Abs (Get Up and Get Started/High Calorie Burn.)which included a walk away belt. I wanted another copy. That is why I ordered the copy through Amazon.  The dvd that I ordered through Amazon did not have the ""walk away belt.""  I sent a email to ""Cherrybooks"" regarding my dissatisfaction and have not received a response.  What is the policy regarding incomplete orders?",1255651200,,427,4.821917808219178
1862897,4,B00008W2TD,"I purchased this DVD based on results a friend of mine had by using the workouts from this series and Weight Watchers. With the first workout, I felt the burn in my legs. Sansone's routines are easy to pick up and repetitive enough that you don't get lost. She takes you through various marches, kicks, and incorporates arm movements and the band here and there. I mastered the whole 45 minutes in about 3 weeks, if that long. Got to the point that I would do her 30 minute workout and another 30 minute workout as well. So, I would recommend this workout program to get you started if you never exercised or if you have been out of the exercise game for awhile and you want to ease back into exercise. Plus, you can still get a walk in if the weather isn't cooperating or your exercise buddy is unavailable. Note: You may get tired of the banter after using this DVD awhile.",1251676800,2,875,4.341463414634147

7987298,5,B00008W2TD,"Leslie Sansone's programs are easy to do. It doesn't require much space, yet you get a good workout.  I love to walk but during hot southern summers I just can't do it.
