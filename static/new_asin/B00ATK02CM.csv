8557562,4,B00ATK02CM,"Not as violent as I hoped, but a very enjoyable no-budget action film.  A comic book artist loses his job and his wife, then gets beat unconscious after getting thrown out of a bar.  When he wakes up in a hospital, his brain is damaged and he can no longer feel pain.
Believing himself to be his comic book hero, he sets out to get revenge on the local mafia, who have tried to force his sister out of her home.  I gave this an extra star after watching the behind the scenes feature.  These guys put a lot of work and heart into making this for what looks like zero money.  It's even more impressive to realize that one of the best fight scenes in the movie ( a huge brawl in an illegal casino) was shot with a handheld video camera and one microphone. If you buy this, take the time to watch the making of - you will be impressed with what these guys accomplished. Makes me want to see what they could do with a bigger budget.",1389571200,,928,4.104972375690608
