1085787,4,6305803773,If you are looking for a martial arts movie with more emphasis on fight choreography then this would be a good one for you.  Phillip Rhee demonstrates excellent Tae Kwon Do kicking prowess while bringing out more of his Hapkido skills in number 4.  Very enjoyable.  Number 3 has a good plot as well as fight scenes.  I enjoyed 3 the best.,1126137600,,338,4.403225806451613
1085788,4,6305803773,"The best way to describe Best of the Best 3 and 4 is to say that they are solid action films with a nice display of martial arts spread evenly throughout each one. Phillip Rhee does a terrific job of pulling off punches, kicks, and throws with great mastery. The fight sequences are very believable and are exciting and fun to watch. Most of the fights are of Phillip Rhee against multiple attackers, and these scenes are all done very well. The camera angles offer good glimpses of each technique and the hits all look quite real. Rhee is definitely a very adept martial artist, and it's very clear on screen that he knows what he's doing. However, for those of you expecting intricate one on one fights in the Jet Li/Jackie Chan Hong Kong style you may be disappointed. But if you're merely looking for quick paced action with a story well written enough to serve as links to the action sequences and featuring actors who can actually act, you'll be happy checking this dvd out. It's great, solid action fun, and I would recommend it, especially to fans of Best of the Best and Best of the Best 2. And the best part is that you get two films on one dvd, so you really can't go wrong here. And one last thing: Gina Gershon is in Best of the Best 3. That girl is not only a great looker, but she's a very fine actress as well. So not only do you get great action, decent story and good acting, you get great looking women too. I highly recommend this film!",992822400,7,1456,4.317518248175182
1085789,4,6305803773,"I am glad Best of the Best released on DVD. Even though it is only the 3rd and 4th of the series. The third one is about Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) fights a group of neo-nazi. Best of the Best 4, Tommy is up against Russian mafia who involved in counterfeit. Both movies are quite good for this martial arts action genre. YOu got 2 movies for slightly higher price of a single DVD so it is quite a deal. The picture quality is OK (full screen only) and no 5.1 Dolby Digital, just Dolby 2.0 which is not too bad either. I wish Best of the BEst 1 & 2 will be released soon on DVD. Best of the Best 2 is available on DVD in Canada. For those who can't wait you can find these put up on auctions by Canadians in ebay.

1085790,5,6305803773,"Best of the Best (1) is one of those movies that critics will rip and tear at until their faces turn blue...and yet it's up to its fourth installment.  The audience has spoken, and for good reason.
A unique  ""fighter"" in its depth of characterization and heart as well as  fists and feet, BOTB set a precedent for itself as a movie chock full of  emotion as well as fury.  Despite all the bloodshed and brutal,  well-executed martial arts, Eric Roberts' performance shedding tears drew  the heartstrings of all but the most callous of viewers.  Between his  sterling performance and the blurred acrobatics of Phillip Rhee, BOTB puts  any funky, self-centered VanDamme or Segal movie to shame.  It focuses on  the whole rather than the parts.  The team versus the individual.  These  are disciplines instilled in all credible schools of martial arts.  To work  in unity of all that is around you and not cull one's skill from one's ego.  It is a Hollywood formula broken, and that may be, in part, why news of  its subsequent releases has been limited to word of mouth or a fortuitous  trip to the video store.
BOTB.  For a great fist-pounder with a cohesive  story, it doesn't get it any better than this.",959299200,9,1205,4.6380952380952385
1085791,5,6305803773,"I'm really, really glad they're finally coming out with this on DVD!
BOTB1 is unique, or at the very least very, very rare, in that it's a martial arts film with a story-oriented script.  The story revolves around  the U.S. karate (taekwondo actually) team training for a fight with the  heavily-favored Korean national team.  The characters are both very  believable and complex, particularly Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) and Alex  Grady (Roberts).  Good pacing coupled with spectacularly-choreographed  fight scenes (Roberts' skills at times even appears passable, while both  Rhee's talents are simply amazing!).  A great and surprising ending caps  this film off perfectly.
Good move by making it a double feature, because  I don't think BOTB 2 could've sold itself, being somewhat inferior to the  first installment of the series. The sequel is only loosely based on BOTB1,  and the plot sort of stretches it a bit.  This film is saved only by the  acting talents of the main cast and notably that of Sonny  Landham.
Martial artists (even non-taekwondo enthusiasts) will surely  love this film, as well as those interested in action movies with a  dramatic twist.",957916800,5,1164,5.128342245989304
1085792,5,6305803773,"Best of Best (1) is a great film. The backdrop of the matrial arts tournament versus Korea sets the stage for valuable life lessons on team integrity and team dynamics.  The competitive fights are technically and coreographically mediocre, but the wins and losses are all the more  heartfelt because of the way we've grown along with the characters. It has  a touching 'surprise' ending as well.  And it has James Earl ""Darth  Vader"" Jones as the hard nosed coached.  What more do you want?  I'll  tell you what, when you see Eric Roberts cry, you will give up the ghost.",956102400,,571,4.64
1085793,5,6305803773,"I'm a big movie buff, and Best of the Best is vastly underrated.  If you've read a review and the review trashed it, don't panic.  Maltin hates it, but I'm very picky and can't stand cheapo B action movies.  This one  isn't just a notch above... it's one of the best action flicks ever  made.
Best of the Best II is your standard big-fight action flick,  unfortunately.  Still, it's okay to burn an afternoon watching it.",953337600,,421,4.4605263157894735
1085794,4,6305803773,"This is one of the best double feature can offer. The first one deals with self struggle to win a competition with Korea team in a tornament.  Very good feel movie, kinda like Rocky 4.  The second one is differnt kind of  movie, a straight fight movie, in LAS VEGAS underground fight.  Very very  good kungfu movie, with great high kicks, steel stick fights.  A very  underrated movie, like  'Perfect Weapon'.  Definitely worth watching.",951696000,,437,4.797297297297297
1085887,5,6305803773,"If 4 is even a slight upgrade from 2 or 3, then you'll have a good, keepable movie. 2 has pretty good fighting scenes, but the storyline and characters kind of sucked a little. 3 is better than 2 all around; it is equal or better than 2, as far as the fighting scenes go, but the storyline is incredible and the characters mesh well together. 3 is definitely worth the cost and, if 4 is as good as 3 or a little bit better than 2, then this double feature is a gold mine. I haven't seen 1 or 4, but 3 is worth it! Even though I haven't seen 1 or 4, this Philip Rhee is ubertalented and you'll feel cheated--if you like martial art films--that he wasn't in more films and ballyhooed like Seagal and Van Damme. He's definitely as gifted as any other fighter(maybe equal or very close with Van Damme) since Bruce Lee. You have to check out examples of his ability and skill. I did not even know there was a 4th movie, until I was googling it. People are giving it a good review and I plan on checking this one out when I get a chance.",1357689600,,1031,4.0588235294117645
1085888,4,6305803773,"I didn't even know these were out there until I happened upon Philip Rhee's biography on the internet. Eric Roberts and the kid that played his son are not in these two features.

  The #3 feature was sort of predictable but the #4 was very entertaining.  I understand there is a #5 somewhere.",1313971200,,293,4.471698113207547

1085890,3,6305803773,"It took two movies and six years of playing second fiddle to Eric Roberts, but eventually, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>&nbsp;series openly became what it had pretending not to be all along: an extensive vehicle for martial artist Phillip Rhee. Sadly, Rhee's career as an action hero in his own right was short-lived, but his two solo outings have been rightfully preserved in this basic, bare-bones double feature set.

We start off with my choice of the two, ""No Turning back"", in which a returning Tommy Lee (Rhee) rides into a town besieged by a violent white supremacy group corralled by a Neo Nazi (Mark Rolston,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B0000399WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>) who has murdered a black preacher. When his family and friends are targeted for their race and defiance of his whims, Lee takes the fight to the skinheads via his unparalleled martial arts skills.
Despite the commonness of the subject matter, few action films (short of Steven Seagal fare) undertake heavy-duty social issues like this. While the plot is fairly black & white and therefore might repel more sensitive viewers, this one really ought to have been the template for future Rhee-brand action movies. Though the film is only loosely connected to its prequels, Rhee keeps his former co-stars from being missed by dominating the screen impressively. Martial arts encounters are abundant, well-shot and choreographed, and feature Rhee's matchless forms-work. It becomes a cumulative action flick by including an explosive and surprising good assault on the supremacist base involving machine guns, rocket launchers, and an eye-opening motorcycle stunt.
Production values are consistently strong and the acting is surprisingly good: Rhee exhibits good chemistry with love interest Gina Gershon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirls/dp/0792844882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirls</a>), and allies Christopher McDonald (""Requiem for a Dream"") and Anzu Lawson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Yakuza/dp/B0016MJ6NI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Yakuza</a>) get decent screentime. Altogether, this makes for a four-star movie on its own.

On to the second, less significant film, ""Without Warning""...

Tommy Lee, now a father and a widower, is thrust into a deadly scheme when Russian terrorists led by the insidious Slava brothers (pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;Tobin Bell and German-born Thure Riefenstein,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crusaders/dp/B000ALM426/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crusaders</a>) suspect him of carrying a disc containing the plans for their plot to flood the market with counterfeit currency. Lee must avoid enemies from both the underworld and the infiltrated police department as he tries to get his daughter to safety.
By the time ""Without Warning"" rolled around, the franchise had lost much of its zing, originality, and had practically nothing to do with the rest of series anymore, making this one the only real throwaway action film of the bunch. Despite featuring a neat cast including Ernie Hudson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostbusters/dp/B000060K4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostbusters</a>) as a tough police captain, the movie has a vaguely obscure feel to it thanks to reduced production values and action content. Don't get me wrong, I've seen a lot worse on the DTV market, but in comparison to its three predecessors, sequel number three is the most likely to get lost in the crowd of hundreds of other low-budget beat-'em-up flicks.
Unpromising special effects start off the film, for the duration of which Rhee spends more time running from his attackers than fighting. When he does fight, it's less smooth than what you've come to expect at this point...with the exception of a neat four-on-one brawl in which he takes on a gym of escrima practitioners with a rapier. Gunfights are completely overlookable. Production values are decent, but lack the professional gloss of its predecessors. It's harder to care about this cast of characters, and eventually, the only thing significant about the movie is that it would be the last time we'd see Rhee in a real movie. Consider it a three-star flick.

In the end, ""Without Warning"" and the lack of any kind of special features team up against the very good thing that is ""No Turning Back"" to the point that I have to settle for but an average rating for the collective package. It's definitely a worthwhile investment for martial arts fans looking for more goodness from Master Rhee, but not at the expense of the original two ""Best of the Best"".",1265414400,,5050,6.24103299856528

1085894,3,6305803773,"BEST OF THE BEST 3
4 STARS - STILL GOING STRONG

Although Best of the Best 3 is far different than the first 2 films, and its only returning character is Tommy Lee (Philip Rhee), the movie does a great job with a good plot, characters, and lots of well-done action scenes.  The movie deals on the issues of hatred in a small community, and fortunately isn't really ever cheesy.  For a B-grade movie, this is definetly one of the finer jobs.  Even the acting overall isn't bad.

As mentioned, the action is great.  There are lots of martial art fights, gun fights, and explosions galore.  Philip Rhee does excellent choreography making the fights look very real.  The last fight between him and the main villain is about 3 minutes long and looks pretty good.

Best of the Best 3 turned out to be much better than I thought originally.  The story and action is above par for a B-grade movie.  If you are a fan of Philip Rhee or enjoyed the first 2 Best of the Best films, you will have no problem enjoying the 3rd movie as well.

BEST OF THE BEST 4
3 STARS - WORST OF THE SERIES

Best of the Best parts 1 & 2 were easily some of the best made B-martial arts movies ever created.  Part 3 took it down a few notches, but still was excellent.  Without Warning - the 4th and final entry in the series - is average at best, and comes up short in many ways compared to it predacessors.

Again, like in No Turning Back, Philip Rhee as ""Tommy Lee"" is the only returning charcater from the first Best of The Best films.  Also, like in #3, there is no tournament or gambling fight action but a fairly life-like scenario taking place in the real world.  The story is about a couple of guys led by Lukasz Slava (Tobin Bell from the ""Saw"" series) and his handy #2, Yurik Slava (Thure Riefenstein) who go in the counterfeit money making businees.  With vital information on a disc that a girl takes for evidence, she slips it into Tommy's pocket as the bad guys come after her.  Unaware at first, he soon realizes the hard way that the guys have discovered he has the disk and kidnaps his daughter eventually in order to get it back.

While the story is just average, it is told the same way too.  I never found any aspects that really excited me.  Although it was pleasant to see Tobin Bell play the boss, both he and his #2 never amazed me.  As for action, I was expecting to see more, but it seems each movie in the series contains less and less.  The only worthy scene was Tommy taking care of a gym full of guys.  Its really the only scene where he gets to fully show off his martial arts skills.  The final fight between him and Yurik was so dissapointing.  It takes place on an airport runway at night, but contains very little martial arts and is about a 2-1/2 minute scene.  When you factor in the other scenes that are occuring and being switched back and forth too during these 2-1/2 minutes, I bet the fight itself is less than a minute.

Combined on one disc, these 2 movies are still a bargain.  Not the worst movies ever made, but its diffcult to find many films featuring Philip Rhee, and the Best of The Best series is what he is most famous for.",1182297600,,3147,4.265202702702703
