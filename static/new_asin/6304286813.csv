836023,2,6304286813,"For the talent involved I gave it two stars but if it were not for that I wouldn't have given any. I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was pretty bad then: as history and as a movie. I watched it again recently to give it a 2nd chance. So much the worse for me. It was popular in the late 60's and early 70's to make revisionist style Westerns to show that ""them thar days weren't as good as you thought"" and adding  a sort of artsy-fartsy  flair It might have worked here except for the material. Almost the whole damn movie is a lie. It's true that the preceeding earp fair (THE GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, MY DARLING CLEMENTINE,ETC.) were sadly lacking in the history department but this movie was so ""rivisionist"" that anything even remotly positive even if it was true was either left out or flatly denied. There was a long review in a magazine that I read shortly after the movie was released called ""THE DEBUNKING OF A DEBUNKING"" who's title I thought said it best.(I wish I could remember the magazine) Needless to say they felt much the same that I do.  Even though the previous movies showed Earp and Holliday to be far better people than they were, some one went to a great deal of time and expense to show that they were far, far worse than they really were and then they wrapped the story in a pretty awful movie. If your interested in the subject matter then do your best to borrow a copy of this movie because I can be pretty sure that you'll only watch it once and then only if you can stop laughing long enough to hear it.",990662400,8,1559,4.224832214765101
836239,4,6304286813,"As a Doc Holliday student, anything I can get on him I can. Great actors yet it would be great if they would find actors and actresses closer to how the original folks looked.  Raised a good Catholic wealthy young man sent to Dental school only to wind up getting TB like his mother, he moves out west thinking the dry climate and the wealth to be had could help him cure the TB. He only finds himself a desperado with the love of gambling and the devil at his heals of when is his time will be up. It's as if he is playing the ultimate gambling game of life with his own life and a thrill seeking partner with him, Big Nose Kate. Again if you have read any of my other reviews, we have here some good/great actors and actresses that need a better acting director or acting/directing team. Probably one of the best works I've seen Stacy Keach perform. Faye Dunaway is great as usual. Some of story lines and situations could have been developed and rehearsed better, yet, I believe the phase at this time point was let it role and what ever comes out naturally is they way it ought to be...

836245,3,6304286813,"Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are portrayed in this film as insincere men interested in money. Earp is running to be sheriff so that he can fleece the town while Holliday take all the gamblers for as much money as he can get. But Earp is far worse than Holiday. Contrary to the seemingly thousands of films about the gunfight at the OK Corral, it is not Ike Clanton who forces Earp and his brothers to fight, it is Earp who provokes the fight to persuade the town that he is the most fit person to serve as sheriff. Holliday does not want to join because he understands the true reason for the fight.

836246,1,6304286813,"Dull and pretentious revisionist western written by novelist Pete Hammil and directed by Frank Perry in his I-am-an-artist mode.  Doc is the story of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, where the famous gunfight at O.K. Corral took place.  But in this version, Doc Holliday is a washed up, dying opium addict who has taken up house with a prostitute he won in a card game.  Doc Holliday has turned into a philosophical, fading romantic with no stomach for killing.  In this telling Wyatt Earp instigated the famous gunfight purely to help his campaign for sheriff and is depicted as being ambitious, power hungry and corrupt.  This is not your father's Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

The problem is that none of this revisionism ends up making for very interesting or entertaining cinema.  The point of Doc seems to be to deflate the myth behind Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday as they have traditionally been portrayed--but to what end, exactly?  I really don't know who this movie is even aimed at.  Fans of traditional westerns will likely be bored silly as there is virtually no action.  Fans of serious drama will likely find the western genre trappings off-putting.  Fans of 1970's auteur cinema will likely admit that director Frank Perry wasn't quite one of those, although he had ambitions in that direction with early films like The Swimmer and Diary of a Mad Housewife.  But it's telling that his most famous film is very likely the hyper campy Mommie Dearest, which is pretty far from being an art film.

Of the performances Stacey Keach brings a weariness to his Doc Holliday that is effective if one-dimensional.  Faye Dunaway can't do much with her underwritten part of the prostitute who shacks up with Doc.  On a certain level, I got the impression the movie wanted that relationship to be a love story, but the too-cool-for--school writing and directing team seem determined to avoid anything that could be interpreted by the audience as sentimentality, so the movie is a bust on that score as well.  Character actor Harris Yulin plays what is probably the most unlikable Wyatt Earp ever filmed, but turning Wyatt Earp into a villain in and of itself isn't enough to make the character interesting--Yulin ends up giving the weakest performance among the trio of leads.

Revisionist adult westerns that came about in the wake of The Wild Bunch (Soldier Blue; The Hunting Party; The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing) weren't all that good at the time and have generally aged very poorly.  Doc falls very squarely into that category--it's a pretentious bore that could only have been made in the early to mid-1970's because there was no other time a Hollywood studio would actually greenlight something like this.  Some people claim that The Wild Bunch killed the western genre but that isn't true--movies like Doc killed the western genre.  The Wild Bunch just helped to make movies like Doc possible.",1471046400,,2911,4.866125760649087
836247,3,6304286813,"Stacy Keach and Faye Dunaway are excellent as Doc and Katie; however the latter half of the film is unconvincing--one, because Wyatt Earp is made into a politically motivated villain almost as bad as the Clanton clan, and two, because Doc's relationship with one of the younger ""cowboy villains,"" associate of the Clantons, is a long stretch, particularly since Doc ends up shooting the boy simply because as he says, ""you remind me too much of myself.""  Having read the well-researched biography of Wyatt Earp by Tefertiller, I believe the real villain of the piece with political ambitions was Sheriff Behan (hardly visible in this version).  Billy Clanton, not Ike Clanton, was the really dangerous member of the Clantons who almost killed Virgil Earp, whereas the trial of Wyatt brought by Ike Clanton and Sheriff Behan revealed that Ike actually ran away from the gunfight near the corral.  Billy Clanton was the one who opened fire first, not the Earps as this version of the story tells it.  Tefertiller's biography of Wyatt reveals that the background of the famous gunfight and its aftermath was the political struggle between Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans, actually won by the Southerners of the community and and local ranchers, leading to the blackening of the Earps' names.  The Earps came to be seen by the locals as Yankee trouble-makers and they had to flee the community.  It is this aspect of the story that seems to have influenced the making of ""Doc,"" in which the Earps are presented as just as villainous as the Clantons, if not more so.
The definitive version of the Tombstone Gunfight remains to be made.  But the historical novels by Mary Doria Russell of the same name, ""Doc,"" and ""Epitaph"" (about the Earp brothers) provide great background for such an endeavor.",1466985600,4,1803,4.950331125827814

836372,4,6304286813,"'Doc', from 1971, is an odd take on the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, in 1881.  It is more ambiguous than usual, and you really don't think that Doc Holliday was that willing to go along with his Earp friends in this version. It's vague and subdued and has some low-key acting, but I thought it was better than average and not a bad find.

Faye Dunaway's added as a trollop domestic love interest of Doc Holliday.

One thing to point out is that Wyatt Earp is portrayed by the characteristically unhandsome, ""bug eyed"" actor Harris Yulin ( Scarface (1983), Night Moves (1975), Clear and Present Danger (1994)). He's a bit odd and doesn't have the necessary power or  gravitas to give him that punch that the character so richly deserves. Stacy Keach is fine as Doc Holliday, a bit of a rambler here.

The ""Cowboys"", the Earps' enemies, are the weak link, as they are just basically rude and not very interesting.

836377,4,6304286813,"""Doc"" (1971) is another cinematic account of the events leading up to the gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. As the title suggests, this version focuses a little more on Doc Holliday (Stacy Keach) and his woman Kate (Faye Dunaway). Harris Yulin plays Wyatt Earp.

In the 60s and 70s filmmakers rebelled against the unrealistic and even goofy tone of many prior Westerns and focused on something closer to the gritty truth of the Old West. That's what you get with ""Doc,"" albeit with a hefty helping of melodrama and surrealism. Previous film versions made Wyatt out to be a veritable hero, like 1957's ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" where the climatic gunfight went on forever. In reality it only lasted like 30 seconds and this movie shows this. I'm not saying ""Doc"" is the most accurate portrayal of the events because it's not. Costner's ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) comes closest to the truth (so far), but it too takes liberties with the subject. Despite what curmudgeonly critics of ""Doc"" say  that ""it replaces positive lies with negative lies""  it isn't that much different of a take on the subject than Costner's version or 1993's ""Tombstone.""

The characters of Doc and Kate are roughly the same; the most significant change is that Wyatt is portrayed less positively. And this explains the mass denunciation of ""Doc""  people don't like their sacred heroes being maligned. But ""Doc"" should at least be given credit for being the first film on the topic where these ""heroes"" are shown closer to who they really were. Forget Burt Lancaster, Henry Fonda, Hugh O'Brian, et al, Yulin is truer to the spirit of Wyatt's intention to clean up the town at all costs, settle some scores, and get rich in the process.

Besides, no film that comes out of Hollywood is accurate. They're all skewed by the times and political persuasions of those involved. ""Doc"" came out at the tail-end of the Vietnam fiasco where authority figures were no longer trusted and the movie reflects this. It's no different than any other inaccurate Hollywood history lesson (e.g. ""My Darling Clementine"" and ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral) and is actually closer to the truth in some ways. Furthermore, ""Doc"" isn't a documentary -- none of the films about Earp/Holliday are  they're MOVIES. And this is a well-made, well-acted version of the tale with an interestingly grim outlook and script where Keach and Dunaway are at their best.

Speaking of Keach, Brian Garfield castigated the film in his book ""Western Films,"" denouncing Keach's portrayal of Holliday as ""robust"" when nothing could be further from the truth. Keach plays Doc as a thin, seriously half-dying man who's not sure what he wants, but is still relatively likable, at least more so than Earp.

As for Doc's unattractive babe, Big-Nose Kate, people criticize that Dunaway was ""too glamorous"" in the role, but she worked fine for me (besides, I don't remember any of the other versions casting a homely woman in the role). This brings up something exceptional about ""Doc"": The dust and dirt on the people  their clothing and faces  smacks of the way it really was in the Old West more-so than previous renditions.

Some people have said that this version makes the Clantons more positive, but I didn't see it. They're depicted as the dirtbag troublemakers they were and the hatred between them and the Earps is palpable. ""Doc"" takes an evenhanded approach to the material and shows flaws on both sides, but still ends up somewhat siding with Doc and the Earps.

There are some slow parts but the drama kept my interest and memorable parts abound, like Doc & Kate's journey across the desert, Wyatt's confrontation with the Clantons and the ensuing knock-down-drag-out fight with Ike (excellently portrayed by Michael Witney), Doc's rollicking rescue of Kate from a house of ill repute and the dynamic climatic gunfight.

One negative is that the film was shot in Spain and you can always tell the difference between Spain and the American Southwest, but  I have to admit  the locales are excellent and sometimes stunning, like the Clanton ranch.

Final Word: I don't get why this version of the Earp/Holliday saga is so despised and obscure. It's a gritty, engrossing depiction of the events that offers potential insights to the table, although it probably goes too far to the negative with Wyatt; and even Doc at the climax (you'll know what I mean). Nevertheless, it smacks of solemn realism (despite its inaccuracies) with a side of surrealism. ""Doc"" is a worthy addition to the myriad cinematic renditions of the famous events.

An American production shot in Spain with some parts in Old Tucson, the film runs 96 minutes.

836486,4,6304286813,"Let's get this out of the way.  Doc is not historically accurate.

This is a 1971 Western which depicted the West in more realistic, gritty detail than the John Wayne, James Stewart, Roy Rogers and Randolph Scott's westerns of the same time period.  This Western realism genre arose in the 60's and early 70s showing the West as a place where the lines of good and bad were blurred.

The story centers on Doctor John H. Holiday, a Southern gentleman displaced by time and circumstance. He's was a dentist who became a gambler and killer.  The two main prongs of this film are Doc's relationship with Kate Elder and Wyatt Earp.

Both Kate and Wyatt bring different characteristics of Doc to the surface.  Doc's consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis) is emphasized more than in the previous films or the films to come after.  It must have been a terrible disease to live with daily for a man like Doc, especially with his intemperate lifestyle.

His friendship with ""The Kid"", Ike Clanton's nephew, added another side to Doc.  He saw in this youngster a mirror of himself and wanted to direct him into a better path.  Unfortunately, Doc had to face his pupil in the gunfight at the OK Corral in the end of the film.

Wyatt Earp was presented as an enigma.  He was not the man and friend that Doc knew in Dodge.  Tombstone had changed him.  His motivation for running for County Sheriff was not totally clear until the end.

The friendship of these two men has been a subject of curiosity and debate for over a century.  What made them friends and what kept them together is a story in itself.

It is very obvious in this film that Wyatt cared deeply for Doc.  Doc was always there for Wyatt.

The film was filmed in Spain.  The trek of Doc and Kate across the desert at the beginning of the film is well done.

The physical fight between Wyatt and Ike at the Clanton Ranch was well played without heroics.  It was two men who hated each other allowing their hatred to boil over in a violent confrontation.

Does this film add anything to the Earp/Holiday film library?  I think it does in the sense that it gives psychological insights about Holiday which have not otherwise been given to this man who lived a fabulous life but always on the edge of death.",1338163200,6,2252,4.514851485148514

836599,1,6304286813,"Do yourself a favor and forget for a moment that the film ""Doc"" is about real historical people - Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp - and pretend that it's merely a western. If you're interested in the real people, there are several films available including ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994), ""Tombstone"" (1993), and ""Hour of the Gun"" (1967). Films such as ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957) and ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) are as fictionalized as ""Doc"".

The film stars Stacy Keach (Doc) and Faye Dunaway (Big Nose Kate) with Harris Yulin as Wyatt

Stacy Keach has been providing good entertainment for more than 50 years. ""Doc"" was his 6th film and his first leading role. That led to a role opposite George C Scott in ""The New Centurions"" (1972) and he went on to do more than 50 films, including ""The Long Riders"" (1980) with his brother James.  He's best known for his role in the TV series ""Mike Hammer"". Unfortunately he sleep walks through this film.

There is little to say about Faye Dunaway that isn't already known. She won the Oscar for ""Network"" (1977) and was nominated for ""Chinatown"" (1975) and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1968). She won an Emmy for a guest appearance on ""Columbo"" in 1994 and won Golden Globes for her work on ""Gia"" (1998), ""Ellis Island"" (1984), and ""Network"" (1976). On the other hand, she won 2 Razzies for bad performances (""Mommie Dearest"" and ""The Temp"") and was nominated 6 more times. Her role in ""Doc"" falls more clearly on the Razzie side.

Harris Yulin is not a well known name. ""Doc"" was his second film. He moves between film and TV. He's probably best known for his performance as Quentin Travers, the head Watcher on the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" but he's appeared in many big box office films such as ""Training Day"" (2001), ""Rush Hour 2"", ""Murder at 1600"" (1997), ""Ghostbusters 2"" (1989), etc. He usually plays a cop. Unfortunately he doesn't really pack the star power necessary to make Wyatt Earp an interesting character.

Peter Hamill won an award for the film's script from the Western Writers of America. Hamill is an interesting character, best known for helping disarm Sirhan Sirhan after he shot Bobby Kennedy. He's a journalist and his works appear in The Village Voice, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, etc. Definitely a left of center personality, Hamill's orientation is clear in the film's off kilter portrayal of the Holiday/Earp relationship. But the attempt to portray deep psychological meaning falls flat. Instead the film is merely boring.

Frank Perry produced and directed. Perry was best known for his first effort, ""David and Lisa"" (1962), but he has several well known films to his credit, including ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" (1970) and ""Mommie Dearest"" (1981) where he joined forces with  Faye Dunaway again. Many of his films focus on dysfunctional families, and he brought that perspective to ""Doc""

Jimmy Webb did the music. Webb is a terrific writer, responsible for ""By the Time I get to Phoenix"", ""Up Up and Away"", MacArthur Park"", ""Witchita Lineman"", etc. ""Doc"" was his second film, and he would sporadically work on film scores including ""Naked Ape"" (1976), Voices"" (1979), ""The Last Unicorn"" (1982), and ""The Santa Clause"" (1994).

""Doc"" needs to be viewed through the eyes of the early 70s. Nixon was the President,  the Vietnam war was still raging, ""Woodstock Nation"" was making the transition to disco, and the major films of the times were ""Five Easy Pieces"","" MASH"", ""Zabriske Point"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""The Hospital"", ""The Candidate"", ""Deliverance"", ""The Ruling Class"", etc. All these films sought to re-envision their traditional genres and the back stories.

""Doc"" belongs to the revisionist westerns of the period, such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1968), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""Tell Them Willie Boy is Here"" (1969), ""Little Big Man"" (1970), ""Soldier Blue"" (1970), ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971),  and the ultimate revisionist western - ""Dirty Little Billy"" (1972).

But regardless of whether you avoid this film because of its historical inaccuracies or just because it is downright boring, you  can do something better with 90 minutes of your life.",1269820800,6,4161,4.932761087267525

The characterizations of the main characters is totally wrong and nothing is even remotely historically accurate.

836603,1,6304286813,"I love Stacy Keach especially when he appeared in the Mike Hammer series on  TV. I thought that this could have similar banter with big nose Kate Elder similarly to his sidekick Velda from the TV series. It seems to be that there is a conflict in the story that shows that Wyatt Erp was in fact a crooked, low life, scoundrel that lied, cheated and bought his way to fame rather than being the tough hard nosed lawman portrayed in other stories. This movie doesn't even document the shootout at the OK coral as other stories do involving ERP, Holiday, the Clanton's McClowery's and other riff raff that was out to get the Erps in Tombstone. What is more puzzling about this version of the story is that Doc Holliday's relationship with Wyatt Erp was more akin that of Erp just hanging around Holiday like a fifth wheel rather than it being a true friendship. As westerns go this one doesn't' really have enough shootouts and fights in it to consider it a classic. The star power of Keach and Dunaway seems like it would have the potential for interesting banter. However, I don't believe that they delivered anything that would be considered a lasting impression. After seeing the version with Kevin Costner in it several times, I was hoping to see something of similar quality from a different point of view. However, this was not the case. I just can't believe that they omitted the shootout at the OK corral and the events that followed. That gunfight became the standard by which all other westerns are judged. I'm surprised that Rich Little didn't have to intervene by doing voice overs in this picture like he did for the Hammer series, that's the only other occasion when I can think of Keach faltering at attempting to portray a character completely as he did with this movie. Even if this movie were on Encore or some other premium movie channel, I would not recommend wasting your time watching it.

It is definitely down beat and rather coarse.  It is not historically accurate, particurlarly in terms of the final shoot out at the OK Corral.  However, it does hold your interest.  Stacey Keach's and Faye Dunaway's acting is very good.  It was filmed in the era of the revisionist westerns.  If you are turned off by that, this will not appeal to you.  Otherwise, I recommend Doc for casual viewing.",1252800000,9,539,4.659574468085107
836605,3,6304286813,"This film, probably the 1000th telling of the shoot out at the OK Corral, has a different perspective from most of the films I have seen on this subject, from 'My Darling Clementine' to 'Tombstone.'  Doc Holliday, played by Stacy Keach, is ambivalent about his life and unhappy with the killings.  Wyatt Earp on the other hand is a villainous politician whose only desire is to get political power and milk the town dry.  Ike Clanton is seen more as a victim of the heartless Wyatt Earp.  Faye Dunnaway does an excellent job playing Doc's temporary girl, Katie Elder.
Some of the scenes in the film are really striking, particularly the scenes of Doc and Katie struggling through the desert to get to Tombstone.
There are no heroes in this film and the violence is minimal.  The entire shootout at the OK Corrall was over in a few seconds.  There are also no happy endings here.  Doc has a chance at redemption and throws it away to shoot 'The Kid' who reminds him too much of himself.  Earp apparently wins the day by wiping out the Clanton gang and then making a political stump speech.  This is probably one of the most cynical films I have ever seen.  If you like old fashioned westerns, avoid this one.  But this film speaks mountains as to our politics today.",1244937600,25,1265,4.52863436123348
836606,3,6304286813,"Was the west really this gloomy? Probably. But do we wish to see it in a Western? ""Doc,"" an interesting version of the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral, chooses to demystify the combatants with the exception of Doc Holliday (Stacy Keach) and Big Nose Kate (Faye Dunaway). It's a squalid land complete with dishonorable alley brawls and buzzing horse flies.

Director Frank Perry has several interesting films on his resume&nbsp;&nbsp;(1968),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rancho-Deluxe/dp/B00004ZBVJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rancho Deluxe</a>&nbsp;(1975)] and ""Doc,"" a 1971 product of the anti-Vietnam War times, was his attempt to unmask the statuesque heroes churned out by the John Wayne factory&nbsp;&nbsp;(1970),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Jake/dp/B00008CMR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Jake</a>&nbsp;(1971)]. It's a revisionist Western, though completely lacking in historical authenticity.

Harris Yulin, an excellent character actor who portrays the villain more often than not, is an unusual (though intentional) choice for Wyatt Earp. He mopes and broods while staring with unblinking eyes at Doc Holliday's body, Big Nose Kate, Ike Clanton, his horse - anything within his line of vision. Yulin's Earp is a bleak assassin on the verge of firing his gun at the drop of a spittoon. He hides behind his weapon and when forced to fight Clanton man-to-man with fists, is soundly pummeled. Holliday is the even-tempered partner walking the streets alone in dark suits. Everyone fears and respects Doc, a gunfighter with the proverbial heart of gold. He protects Earp, making sure he and his disinterested brothers stay out of trouble, going against the grain of general historical belief.

Keach, as usual, is excellent in the title role. This was an interesting performance during the peak of his career, and he portrays Doc as a tortured soul wishing to escape the life of a notorious gunfighter. His only happiness comes from his relationship with Kate, who he kidnaps from a life of prostitution. They buy a humble home and decide to forge a life of domesticity. The scenes are not particularly believable and Dunaway seems out of her element. For a film attempting to reveal the dark underbelly of the Western myth, casting the strikingly beautiful Dunaway seems peculiar at best. She chews the scenery in her typical style, answering the door whenever the unblinking Wyatt pays an awkward visit - ""Where's Doc? I need him,"" a statement having more than one meaning.

The rest of the cast is unknown, owing much to the fact the movie was filmed in Spain. With the exception of Sergio Leone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/6304698798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B0000AUHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>, I have never been a fan of European-filmed Westerns, lacking the appropriate topography and supporting color. One could argue this gives ""Doc"" a dream-like quality, a familiar drama playing on an alien landscape. Perry wants to sweep away the ghosts of Ford, Fonda, Sturges and Lancaster, and perhaps this is a film only Sam Peckinpah could love. But ""Doc"" lacks the intense detail and artistic vision of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Bunch-The-Original-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BT96CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1969) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pat-Garrett-and-Billy-the-Kid-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BT96DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1973), far superior Westerns in tone, idea and - let's face it - budget.

With inexplicable slowness, the movie stumbles towards the OK Corral battle. While the confrontation is no more realistic than in previous films, perhaps a drama attempting to cut to the bone should pay more attention to history. The Clantons outnumber the Earps more than 2-to-1, Earp and his men carry shotguns, one of the Earp brothers is killed and Doc even guns down a youthful Clanton with whom he forged a father/son relationship. None of this is true, though I like the idea that Doc's action, as he pauses briefly in thought before shooting the boy through the heart, is his way of delivering the coup de grace to his legacy. The old ways have come to an end, and now the Earps can take root.

Disillusioned, having lost Kate because of his opium addiction and dying of the now-famous coughing disease, Doc rides out of Tombstone alone. It's all very somber, played to the tune of mournful guitar. ""Doc"" would have been better served to have not been based on the legendary shootout, but then it would not have been bankrolled. How's that for existential dilemma?",1242864000,13,5138,6.179020979020979

Faye Dunaway plays Kate Elder, a prostitute won by Doc Holliday in a card game, in this sort of remake of gunfight at the OK Corral (1957). Doc Holliday is played by Stacy Keach and Harris Yulin is Wyatt Earp. The film picks up the story as notorious gunfighter Doc Holliday arrives in Tombstone, Arizona to help his old mate Earp rid the town of outlaws. Holliday, who is dying of an incurable disease probably figures he has nothing to lose, which is just as well, because the subsequent shoot-out with the Clanton gang resulted in the most famous of all Western legends. It is still a lot of fun with a magnificent score by Jimmy Webb.",1226534400,2,763,5.31404958677686
