7918510,4,B00003G1FY,The beautiful and tranquil locations in this DVD are so soothing it's almost hard to stay awake! I enjoyed the music featuring Wynton Marsalis and just put the volume low to maintain a serene experience.  It would be nice to have some information on the locales. Great way to end your day!,1194998400,,289,4.5576923076923075
7918511,4,B00003G1FY,"As a dedicated Anglophile, I own the Portrait of England on DVD.  The photography is superb and that alone makes it worth watching over and over.  This is photography as an Art form and I often play it with the sound turned off, enjoying the silent countryside and the views of England as the music does get tedious afer dozens of replays.
  This video would have been enhanced by small subtitles (which could be turned off) telling the viewer what they are seeing.  It does leave one sadly adrift and longing for information.  It would also have been enhanced by having the natural sounds of the countryside instead of this too lively music that is unsuited to the pastoral views of Engalnd.",1058918400,7,692,4.631147540983607
7918512,2,B00003G1FY,"The scenery is beautiful, especially the aerial flyovers.  However, I found it very frustrating to have no idea what I was seeing.  Even the most basic captioning would have vastly improved my viewing experience, without detracting from the ""artistic"" side of the presentation.",1001980800,6,277,5.4186046511627906
7918513,2,B00003G1FY,"This DVD plays a number of better known English classical pieces while showing scanning shots of large English country houses. There is no narration, subtitling or labelling of the locations. The video quality is not what we expect of a DVD. Anybody buying this for the graphical content or the travel element will be dissapointed. I recommend buying a CD of Purcell's music, if that is what you want. This thing is worth about the same value (Five to ten dollars).",986688000,7,465,4.753086419753086
