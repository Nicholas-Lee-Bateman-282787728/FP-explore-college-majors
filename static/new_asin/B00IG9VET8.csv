8641956,4,B00IG9VET8,"Whoever said this hasn't been restored is mistaken. This is the 3rd & best version I have of ""War of the Trojans"", The worst version is in a Millcreek 50 pack & so washed out it is completely B/W called ""The Avengers"" the 2cnd one is A.K.A. "" The Glory of Troy"" & has some color remaining but is in very bad condition. This is the best version to date, the restoration job pales in comparison to the Warner Archive version of ""the Slave"" or the restoration I saw on ""The last days of Pompeii"" which both were obviously a labor of love producing beautiful vivid color & perfect sound & picture quality!!! I can not say that for the restoration on this D.V.D. double pack. The Aspect Ratio is a bit off on both films & the restoration job was done half heartedly. But as stated in another review it appears to be the best available at this point. If you have seen the prior releases of ""The Avenger"" A.K.A. "" The Glory of Troy"" it is very noticeable that this ""War of the Trojans"" has had some restoration done, but not the best of quality.  I have been recently trying to collect Steve Reeves films & because Hollywood felt there was not that much interest in the Sword & Sandal or Spaghetti genre these old films fell into disrepair, a recent resurgence in interest has led to some beautiful restorations like the two films I mentioned above. This is a sad effort at restoration but for collectors it stands at the top of the heap until some one takes the time to breath new life into these old films like Warner Archive did with ""The Slave"" & I wish I new who did the restoration job on ""The last days of Pompeii"" as I would love to add that widescreen version to my collection!!!  Needless to say I am not knocked out but I am not entirely disappointed either as it is a obvious upgrade from what I had!  In trying to fill my collection I have discovered there are more A.K.A.'s for the titles of these old Steve Reeves movies than you can imagine, at least there is hope that some day they will be salvaged, & re-released at top quality.",1416528000,5,2040,4.307291666666667
8641957,2,B00IG9VET8,Not bad if you don't mind having the top 3rd & bottom 3rd of the screen black & view the movie in the middle 3rd. Like several other Steve Reeves movies you won't get the full screen.,1405296000,,183,3.972972972972973
8641958,4,B00IG9VET8,"Two of the better Reeves films.  Giant of Marathon is one of my favorites and this is a nice letterboxed copy. Decent story and direction by the great Jaques Tourneur.  War of the Trojans (aka The Avenger) is a sequel to The Trojan Horse.  Although not a great print of the film it's letterboxed, in color, and the best copy of the film I've seen.  If you're a Steve Reeves fan this is a must.  If you're new to the ""sword and sandal"" category this would be a good place to start.",1404345600,4,480,4.173913043478261
