8535489,5,B009410F0G,"This is a great dvd for people who like twisted sister, and hard rock Christmas music. This dvd contains 8 Christmas songs, as well as twisted sisters greatest hits. This is Twisted sisters second Christmas show on dvd, This 2012 version is much better then the 2007 version. This 2012 concert has great sound, unlike there 2007 Christmas dvd were the sound quilty isn't very good. The best Christmas Concert I have ever seen. I also recommend a Twisted Sister Christmas Cd it contains two songs not included on this dvd.",1373846400,,521,4.736263736263736

8535491,4,B009410F0G,I've been a fan of Twisted Sister since their early days before a record deal when they used to play dives and other small venues. I've seen them live over a dozen times. Their live shows are always great and you never know what to expect. I enjoyed this DVD of a Christmas show in Las Vegas. I only gave it 4 stars because I've seen better shows and didn't care too much for their take on some of the Christmas songs they covered. Otherwise this is a great DVD and show.,1356912000,,471,4.130434782608695
