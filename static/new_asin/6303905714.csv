The film begins with a song. They ride in the mountains that are rich in timber. Bugs are attacking trees in that area. A Forest Ranger is shot, and Gene is blamed for this accident. [No test firing of the new rifle?] Gene sells his camp to move away. There is another song. Gene sees how bugs (tusset moths) are killing trees. A falling rock scares a team of horses. The scientists will spray the area with DDT to kill the bugs. [DDT was the new miracle technology.] They only have 30 days to bring in the machines for aerial spraying. Gene learns the truth about the shooting and decides to stay. The logging company stirs up public opinion against the spraying. Will DDT kill the fish in the lake or harm the other animals? Small planes spray the forests. Joe has a problem.

The doctor found dead and dying animals in the forest. Who is responsible? There is a song at the party. The Forest Rangers will investigate the problems. Animals are getting sick and dying. Joe discovers a hidden airplane that is used for spraying. He is shot when he leaves. Another song pads out the story. Gene hears a small plane at night. Joe tells about the plane at Mitchell's place. Gene explains why Mitchell has a motive to stop the spraying: he can harvest dead trees. But Mitchell locks up Gene when he investigates. Will that hold him? There is a fight at the government station. Gene puts out the fire by the tanker truck. Later Mitchell attempts to shoot Gene, but he is stopped. Will Joe save Gene? There is a happy ending, and another song.

Note the differences in this post-war western. In earlier movies the people would be threatened by a big landowner who wanted their property. Here the timbering company is the villain, government employees are the heroes. DDT is used to eliminate noxious insects, and people are worried about this chemical. The government tells people not to worry about DDT, they know best. Who is speaking for the big chemical companies? Is there any danger from these new chemicals?",1276214400,,2050,4.610958904109589
7854321,5,6303905714,"This movie is based on a story about the US Forestry Department. Tree's are being destroyed by parasite.  The plot involves a lumber company who stands to loose millions, a Forest Ranger is shot and Gene Autry and his former army buddies who are also Foresters are called in to help save the forest and solve a mystery.  In this movie, Gene Autry is flying a crop duster plane along with the Cass County Boys.  That is interesting because off the screen Gene actually owned and piloted his own plane.  This is another one of those unusal Autry films with lots of moving equipment and modern vehicles.  For a real change in a Western watch this one!!!",1046131200,6,650,4.521367521367521
