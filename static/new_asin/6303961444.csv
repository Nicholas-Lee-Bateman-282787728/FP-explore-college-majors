740435,4,6303961444,"First of all, as the focus of this film is Maccabees, the name ""Old Testament"" is confusing.  And if you're looking for a visually stunning modern film, complete with special effects and a foot stomping soundtrack, this is NOT your film.

This film is apparently considered by some to be an example of so-called ""Sword-and-Sandal"" - ""a genre of largely Italian-made Historical or Biblical Epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965....The terms 'peplum' (referring to the togas or robes which the ancient Romans wore) and 'sword-and-sandal' were used in a condescending way by film critics"" (Wikipedia).

This film was obviously NOT made with Hollywood-like resources - even the Hollywood of the early 1960s.  Be that said, if you do want to see what's available on film regarding the Maccabees, this IS your film....

""The name Maccabee, probably meaning 'hammer,' is actually applied in the Books of Maccabees to only one man, Judas...first leader of the revolt against the Seleucid kings who persecuted the Jews....the name has come to be extended to the brothers of Judas, his supporters, and even to other Jewish heroes of the period....The two Books of Maccabees contain independent accounts of events (in part identical) that accompanied the attempted suppression of Judaism in Palestine in the second century B.C.....The rededication of the Jerusalem Temple described in 4:36-59 (see 2 Mc 10:1-8) is the origin of the Jewish feast of Hanukkah....The first and second Books of Maccabees, though regarded by Jews and Protestants as apocryphal, i.e., not inspired Scripture, because not contained in the Jewish list of books drawn up at the end of the first century A.D., have always been accepted by the Catholic Church as inspired and are called 'deuterocanonical' to indicate that they are canonical even though disputed by some"" (New American Bible).

It is unfortunate that it is so difficult to find truly substantial critiques of this film.",1372550400,2,1991,5.20625
740436,1,6303961444,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

Euro-epic THE OLD TESTAMENT (Italy/France-1962) was filmed in an extreme wide-screen format that's ruined by picture tube dimension transfers, especially (like this ALPHA version) when pan & scan isn't used. Fully half of every scene lies beyond these enforced borders and it's all too evident, especially in mid-close-ups. During many conversations between two characters for example, all we can see is the background; both actors are entirely cropped out or at best their noses bob into view occasionally.

A plus is adequate voice dubbing, which so often is the weakest element of such works. Costuming and sets are good, but numbers of extras inadequate to convey any sense of grandeur. Finally, the saga (set around 165 BC) of Judas Maccabeus and Israel's uprising against Syrian forces is an episode not found in many Bibles or the Torah.

There are equally poor swords & sandals movies (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HERCULES-AGAINST-THE-MOON-MEN/dp/B0008029XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN</a>), but none worse than this one. A total dud!",1266278400,2,1380,5.754901960784314
740437,2,6303961444,An interesting Euro epic is given a poor presentation on this poor quality Alpha DVD. The color is faded and the picture is not at all sharp. The Goodtimes VHS tape was even better than this and it wasn't all that good. Too bad we will probably never seen a decent widescreen version of The Old Testament on DVD. These Italian Sword and Sandal movies can really look great if given the proper treatment.,1231545600,2,403,4.45945945945946

7857008,1,6303961444,This is a terrible film.  It really is based loosely on the epic struggle by the Maccabean family against Antiochus Epiphanes an heir to the Seleucids  on of Alexander the Great's successors.  The armor and uniforms are inauthentic;production values are awful and the acting is amateurish.  This film is a misnomer.  Actually the setting is  the intertestamental time period.  This movie has nothing to do with the title.  I would not recommend it.,1388361600,,448,5.041095890410959
