477308,4,6302503507,"Though often overlooked as the second in the Dracula series (It doesn't have Christoper Lee). This film might be the best of the bunch. We find a well intentioned young girl going to teach in the Transylvanian  countryside, her path crosses with an apparently well to do older woman who  invites the girl to spend the evening at her castle. There she encounters  the woman's son, Baron Mienster (David Peele), Chained and held prisoner in  the castle by his mother. Meaning well  the girl sets the fast talking  undead free. After he sets his mother straight, it's off to the  country...in search of blood. Peter Cushing has his second go, in one of  his most famous roles, as Dr. Van Helsing. With the kill of the daddy of  all vampires under his belt, Van Helsing is off to slaughter the whole  group of nasty nosferatus. Lots of color, cleavage, and crosses. Great fun!  Leaves you with a little chill and a want to see it again. Too bad it's not  widescreen.",951609600,3,962,4.56140350877193
477309,4,6302503507,"Peter Cushing's performace as the very serious, but incredibly brave Dr. Van Helsing has never been surpassed by any other actor. Indeed, this Hammer Horror seems to be more centered on him and his Church sanctioned  quest to find and destroy the vampires, than the vampires themselves. And  yet-it works. And works well.  He keeps cool in the face of danger, and  his character finds an excellent balance between a factual scientist and a  believer in God. Such a sight is both refreashing and an inspiration.  See anytime. But I recommend that you wait till October when that Halloween  atmosphere is ideal for such a movie.",948499200,7,626,4.849056603773585
477310,4,6302503507,"Despite the title, there is no Dracula in this film, but instead we have a vampire named Baron Meinster. The Baron gets a young French girl to release him from the shackles his mother has put him in.  The Baron begins taking  young women and has plans to take the French girl, but Professor Van  Helsing arrives and begins to realize what is going on and he tries to stop  Meinster.  The film is solid all the way through, good story and credible  acting.  David Peel does a fine job as the slick, but evil vampire and  whoever did his make-up should be commended. Peter Cushing delivers a grand  performance as Van Helsing, Horror of Dracula is a better film, but I think  this is Cushing's best portrayl as the vampire hunter.  This is also a  beautiful film with all the lush, vibrant sets and costumes that Hammer  often had.  Unlike some of the Hammer Dracula films, this one does have a  satisfying ending that  seems more planned than rushed.  This one is  certainly worth buying.",944524800,6,987,4.511363636363637

477312,4,6302503507,"Sometimes overlooked because it didn't star Christopher Lee, ""The Brides of Dracula"" is actually one of Hammer's greatest achievements. Peter Cushing was never better as the unflappable Dr. Van Helsing, who  eventually falls victim to the bite of the vampire himself. In the film,  vampirism itself is likened to a ""sexual perversion"" with  parallels to libertineism, homosexuality, incest and hanging out with the  wrong crowd. Hammer's usual high production values are at their peak. David  Peel's Baron Meinster took a lot of heat for not fitting the vampire cliche  (what? a blond vampire?), but he's suprisingly effective. A highlight is  the scene where an old woman coaxes a newly interred vampire out of the  grave for the first time, in sort of a satanic Lamaze ritual. It was three  years before Hammer would make another vampire film and six years before  Christopher Lee returned. None of these films quite had the style or  freshness of the first two.",916272000,3,964,5.037974683544304
477313,5,6302503507,"""Brides of Dracula"" is one of the best Hammer vampire films, in terms of casting, settings, performances and overall ambience. Unlike later entries in the Hammer vampire genre, the costuming is authentic to the period (indeed, quite beautiful). The interior shots of the coach, the inn, and especially the young woman's wake were so rich with color that I could almost smell the old wood and feel the textures. David Peel plays a vampire who actually is allowed to have a personality and speak lines, and he does a wonderful job. He also is close to the most erotic male vampire in the Hammer line, with a ""tongue bite"" in one memorable scene!  I definitely recommend this film. The storyline works well until the ending, where Hammer usually shoots itself in the foot, alas, by feeling obligated to kill off the vampires and show a happy ending.  The film's most famous scene, in which Van Helsing cauterizes himself with a red-hot branding iron, is deservedly re! membered.  END",901929600,,980,4.821428571428571

477338,4,6302503507,"Transylvania -- still the home of magic and deviltry.

So intones a deep, baritone as we're introduced to our players -- a young lady, Danielle,  who is being bounced about in a fast carriage through the forest, stopping off at an inn, yet followed by a black stranger.

We meet Baroness Meinster, who it turns out flatters young women and bring them to her son, the Baron, who has a taste for blood.

Danielle was on her way to a school for young girls as a student teacher, but instead decided to unshackle the Baron who was locked up by his mom.  Unfortunately for Danielle, she's just let loose a vampire!

We meet Van Helsing as he escorts her to her school, the girl still has no clue.  This becomes  doubly apparent when she meets the Baron again and agrees to marry the guy!  Wow, that was some first date!

The Baron discovers the school for girls -- what a ripe place to pluck the beauties for his recruitment station for the Undead.  Yummy!

Lots of fun in this one:  the dark and stormy night, the intelligent appraisal of Van Helsing, his chasing after vampires without his cross (I was afraid of what would happen if the vampire got a clue that Van Helsing dropped his cross), beating off female vampire bats and trying to save the life (and get her clue) of the infamously naive Danielle.

Peter Cushing is suave and intelligent, jumping around and fighting as well as cold and calculating.

Who really steals the show though is the crazed servant woman Greta, who serves the Baron.  Her cackling and howling reminds me in many ways of the original Renfield as he escaped the ship holding Bela Lugosi's Dracula.

A fine Hammer film -- enjoy!",1247011200,,1656,4.521885521885522
477339,4,6302503507,"I am not a fan of modern horror movies with the emphasis on gore and carnage. But I love this classic film from 1960. BRIDES OF DRACULA is Hammer Films' second vampire movie and is their best. It is even a little better than HORROR OF DRACULA. It is stylish and extremely well acted. Peter Cushing has never been better, and David Peel is perhaps the most memorable screen vampire ever encountered. Martita Hunt is terrific as the vampire's  mother. The movie is atmospheric, scary, and sophisticated. It holds up well today.",1246665600,,525,4.706521739130435
477340,5,6302503507,"Brides of Dracula was the first of Hammer's many sequels to their breakthrough hit, and it's not just the best of the series but one of their very best pictures. There's no Christopher Lee this time round - in fact, there's no Dracula at all - but there's a lot of imagination at play here in a beautifully plotted story that sees Peter Cushing's Van Helsing coming up against David Peel's Baron Meinster, a follower of Dracula's vampire cult, after Yvonne Monlaur's schoolteacher ill-advisedly releases him from the shackles his not-as-mad-as-she-looks mother keeps him in.

There's a lot going on beneath the stylish surface here - a psychiatrist could probably have a field day with the curious relationship between Peel and Martita Hunt (""We pray for death, both of us. At least, I hope he prays""), not to mention Van Helsing's visible discomfort in the company of women - but it never overwhelms the plot, and there's no shortage of memorable scenes, from the professor treating a rather nasty bite he just got to the servant silently offering pointers to a newly created vampire on its first outing as one of the undead. Reuniting most of the behind-the-cameras talent from their first Dracula film and throwing in a rather splendid climax in a burning windmill, this is definitely one of Hammer's finest hours.",1204675200,,1317,4.9058295964125564

I'm a sucker for Lugosi but, this is a decent installment in the Hammer vampire films. This is available on DVD on a set titled Hammer Horror series. This film and 7 others from the Hammer archives are included and released at a very reasonable price. I rate this film 3 1/2 stars.",1199836800,,434,4.240963855421687
477343,5,6302503507,"Okay.

So everyone said how good this movie is so I went out to flea market and bought it.

Okay, first of all. My impression was that this is the funniest Dracula movie you will ever see.

Man, it was so crazy. Okay so this chick was driving and there was this old chick and they got together and they slept in a house or something. Then the young lady saw the guy but she didn't know he was vampire.

Oh yea and the young chick was like going to ladie's college and she had this friend and she looked like Michael Jackson.

So basically the young chick allowed the young dude escape from his mama's house (and his mama was ugly). So they got together and they did they funky things.

And then the young dude kills Michael Jackson wannabe and then she gets thrown in a box and put into the mud but then she wakes up cuz this old fat girl was sitting there saying ""get up"".

And then other time she woke up and she was with young chick in a house with horses and she woke up and started talking MJ.

Anyway its a crazy movie. BUY IT!

Michael Jackson wannabe is the only reason to watch this thing.",1154217600,,1098,4.093457943925234
477373,4,6302503507,"Although the plot has holes in it (three credited writers, including Jimmy Sangers-who wrote the original script-Peter Bryan, Edward Percy, and uncredited Anthony Hinds as well as some rewriting by Fisher and Cushing), ""Brides of Dracula"" still has marvelous acting from Peter Cushing and most of the cast and a number of strong set pieces created by Terry Fisher. It's a worthy sequel to ""Horror of Dracula"" and probably should have been called ""Van Helsing: Vampire Killer"" vs. ""Brides of Dracula"" since Dracula is no where to be found. A young French school teacher inadvertantly releases Baron Meinster (David Peel) from his castle prison when she stays at the Meinster home. The Baron proceeds to wreck havoc on the local village. Dr. Van Helsing (Cushing) shows up just in time to do battle with Meinster and is, himself, bit by a vampire. Van Helsing must cleanse himself in one of the most harrowing and brilliant sequences in the film.

The DVD won't feature any extras nor will you find it under it's title here at amazon.com. Instead, you'll find it under ""Phantom of the Opera"" as it is being bundled with that film (as well as the classic Fisher film ""Curse of the Werewolf"", ""Paranoic"", Cushing's marvelous ""Captain Clegg"" and ""Kiss of the Vampire""). I've listed the ASIN code as well as the website address for the title below.

I can only hope that Universal does a solid job in the transfer as this is being released as a two disc dual sided dual layered budget release (it lists for $29.99). Evidently it's also being released in the UK although I don't know if it is going to be released as part of a pack of Hammer movies like the US release.

477378,5,6302503507,"Transylvania.  Land of dark forests and fathomless lakes.  Dracula, monarch of the vampires, is dead.  Yeah, right.  Around Castle Meinster villagers fear that the undead walk among them.  In this first sequel to ""Horror of Dracula,"" both Dracula and Christopher Lee are conspicuous by their absence.  The action centers on Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) as he battles the effeminate Baron Meinster (David Peel) and his minions.  Freda Jackson steals the show as Greta, the insane familiar of the vampire.  Picture a female Renfield.  She screechingly implores a recently buried victim to rise from the grave.  This resurrection scene is a definite high point as the pale hand gropes upward through the dirt.  Van Helsing stakes the old Baroness Meinster to a couch after the young Baron corrupts her with the vampire's kiss.  Mother love, indeed.  Van Helsing is more physical than intellectual in this flick.  At one point, he jumps into thin air and catches the handhold of a giant windmill blade.  Using his body weight, he drags the great blades into just the right position, and the full moon casts a giant, cross-shaped shadow.  In addition, after Meinster bites Van Helsing on the neck, one of the the greatest scenes in vampire cinema ensues.  Van Helsing's self-cure is of searing heat and cooling holy water.  The viewer can only stay silent before this powerful visual image.  The usual Hammer lush color photography, plunging necklines, and diaphanous gowns are present.  David Peel lacks Christopher Lee's towering image of unholy lust, but there is enough to like about the movie to make ownership worthwhile.  A must for classic horror fans.  ;-)",1035244800,16,1659,5.066666666666666
477379,5,6302503507,"Update: If you haven't gotten it yet, you must get Univeral's boxset The Hammer Collection, which includes a beautiful, anamorphic widescreen transfer of Brides of Dracula. It also include five other Hammer horror/thriller movies.

I'm disapointed when a movie that I consider a gem like this one takes a beating about script development. Yes, there are problems with the script. But somehow it all works on the screen, due no doubt to the direction of Terrance Fisher and Peter Cushing's superb performance.

I'm still mesmerized by the sheer fun and beauty of this movie. It is a fast-pasted vampire-hunter film, with the best vampire hunter ever in the top role as Van Helsing. Peter Cushing makes this role his own, giving it the athletic energy and grace, as well as the heroic mania and intelectualism it had needed for years. This is no tired, stodgy bookworm fighting vampires. This is a guy who can think on his feet and act under the most dire circumstances.

Yes, it's a shame that Christopher Lee chose not to partake in this movie, but the story still holds up with David Peel in the lead vampire role.  He is not the darkly masculine image that Lee portrayed in ""The Horror of Dracula"", but a fair-haired insidious ""sneak"", that sweet talks his female victims until they are caught off guard and devoured.

The photography is breathtaking. This film really deserves a dvd release, for those of us who love it. It is a tribute to Terrance Fisher that he was able to wrangle it all together, bad script or not, into one fun horror film.",1031270400,5,1548,4.718518518518518
477380,5,6302503507,"A young Parisian girl on her way to a girls' school in Transylvania falls in love at first sight with the Byronic Baron Meinster.  Releasing him from his mother's bondage (literally), young Marianne learns too late her newfound Prince Charming is one of Count Dracula's undead apostles.  Soon bloody terror reigns in Transylvania, and only Dr. Van Helsing can put an end to the nightmare and free Marianne from the vampire's curse.
After Horror of Dracula, Brides of Dracula is probably Hammer's most renowned vampire opus, and rightly so.  Though often justly maligned for an undeniably muddled script, Brides of Dracula maintains just enough of a script to give life to its nightmarish fairy tale.  Indeed, Brides of Dracula is in many ways even better than its monumental predecessor.  The sets are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous, the music eerie, the actors and acresses well-adapted to Hammer's gothic formula.  The only thing that keeps Bride of Dracula from being the definitive vampire film is the absence of Christopher Lee, who might as well have signed on for the picture since he ended up being typecast as Dracula later on anyway.
But if David Peel isn't Christopher Lee, he's still a solid master vampire in his own right.  Titian-haired Yvonne Monlaur is a typically ravishing Hammer heroine, and Martia Hunt is a gloriously haughty, wicked, yet sympathetic Baroness Meinster.  Naturally, Peter Cushing dominates all as the unsurpassed Van Helsing, still the gallant vampire hunter and perhaps even better realized here than in Horror of Dracula.
A captivating movie from beginning to end, Brides of Dracula is a highly original entry in the vampire sub-genre that delivers many of the formula's most memorable moments:  the Baron's crazed old nurse calling up one of Meinster's ""girlfriends"" from her freshly-dug grave; the Baron's Mother, newly vampirized, fighting in vain to disguise her new fangs from the intrepid Van Helsing; and of course Van Helsing's thrilling fight to the finish with the wicked Baron, even more exciting than the climax of Horror of Dracula...and this time Van Helsing can't escape the vampire's bite.
Despite the confused script, Brides of Dracula is a classic horror movie and perhaps the best of Hammer's glorious stable.  It might not be the most polished movie, but it is good scary fun.",1022889600,5,2344,5.1286089238845145
477411,3,6302503507,"Fisher's follow-up to his HORROR OF DRACULA(1958) is usually regarded as one of Hammer's, if not Hammer's overrall best. Perhaps this stems from Jack Asher's beautiful color photography, or the wonderful performances from Peter Cushing, Freda Jackson and co., or some of Fisher's most wonderfully staged set-pieces. But theres NO denying that the script Fisher had to work from was, to simply put it- ""drivle"". Perhaps another word -""convoluted"". And just one more - ""incoherent""; would be a good description. The script was troubleded from the start. It went through at least 3 r-writes, each time with one of the writers adding plot-lines and motives. Plot-lines and motives that would later not mesh well with the finished product as filmed. Clearly this could be also blamed on the director. In this case it's Terry Fisher, and well it's been known that Mr. Fisher occasionly did rewrites on practically 90% of his films(some times if not in a literally source, but scripts  usually gave him a chance to add certian aspects and touches to the material during the filming process) On this film Terry DID do his rewrites, as did Peter Cushing, who had contributed a great deal to the film. Apprently not enough time was given, becasue the finished product reeks of plot holes and the movie's symmetrical structure sports what you might consider to be ""uneven"". While on a technical stand-point it is clearly very much a severly flawed work. The film probably works best as an acting piece. Because for one thing this films sports some of the finest acting in a Hammer film(The best EVER? Well..maybe not.) But this aspect proves to be the most consistant thing going for the movie. That and Jack Asher's stunning photography. This film alone is a wonderul showcase for Fisher's use of color as well a testament to Fisher's keen eye for camera-placement.
  This film also showcases a period when Fisher was just about getting deeply personal with the subject matter(something that he'd go greater lenghts in his later romantic works) As usual Fisher's key and consistant theme shines through -""loneliness"" Baron Meinster alone and looking down over the castle wall. Baroness Meinster's tragic lifestyle. . He brought a compelling qauilty to his films in the form of romanticism. His best works weren't really Horror flicks, but something much more. The Brides of Dracula is very much an overrated work, and though it showcases some of Fisher's best work, it also showcases some of his worst. Perhaps becasue of this It should be considered historical. And along with his minor 1959 effort THE MAN WHO COULD CHEAT DEATH, is probably  his weakest effort from Hammer.",1020988800,,2665,4.995495495495495
477412,5,6302503507,"Along with KISS OF THE VAMPIRE, this is the archtypal Hammer vamp flick of the 60's.  The gorgeous Yvonne Monlaur is reason enough to buy this movie.  It's a shame she didn't do many other films (see her in CIRCUS OF HORRORS).  So, as you may have heard, there is no Dracula in this movie.  But there is Van Helsing, always excellently essayed by Peter Cushing.  And there are vampire ""brides"", a memorable resurrection scene with a cackling Freda Jackson, and very nice production values to recommend BRIDES OF DRACULA.  Personally, I find it more exciting than the highly-praised next entry in the series, DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS (not that I dislike that film, mind you).

David Peel is young, decadent Baron Meinster; a vicious vampire and a bisexual epitome of evil, with looks of matinee idol. Yvonne Monlaur is one of her increasingly voluptuous victims. And, of course, that's the unique Peter Cushing as the genuine Dr. Van Helsing.

477414,3,6302503507,"After his classic performance as the Count in Fisher's sublime Dracula (1958), Christopher Lee refused to play the part again for fear of being typecast. In order to cash in on it's string of box-office hits, therefore, Hammer resorted to this odd tale without the Count, which features David Peel as Baron Meinster, the elderly vampire under house arrest in the ancestral castle. His mother(Hunt) protects and provides victims for him until Van Helsing(Cushing) takes up the challenge and saves French teacher Marianne as she is about to marry the young mod in Transylvanian garb, is a poor stand-in for the Count, the movie has some good scenes, including one in which the old sorceress, playing midwife, helpfully removes some earth while whispering encouragements to the vampire trying to break out of her grave. The climax sees Cushing, bitten by the vampire, removing the infectious mark by burning his own neck with a white-hot branding iron before arranging the arms of a moonlit windmill so as to cast the shadow of a cross on Peel. Fisher's typical exellent direction is effective, with his customary lingering camera movements, but the overall result is decidedly uneven.  Lee returned to the series in 1965 for Fisher's marvellous Dracula, Prince of Darkness(1965).

477415,4,6302503507,"The more times I watch this Hammer classic, the more I realize that it doesn't hold up all that well to multiple viewings. Don't get me wrong; it's a gorgeous film to look at, everyone involved (cast & crew) are great and I love it dearly, but it IS pretty silly. These Hammer movies (espcially the vampire ones) are so straightforward and predictable, they're almost childish. (-The actor who portrays the obligatory Hammer priest looks on in disbelief, as if he thought so too.) Dear Peter Cushing, bless him, can play these types of roles sleepwalking it seems. David Peel makes a very effective vampire, apart from Count Dracula himself, probably the best of any Hammer film. And it's always nice to see good old Norman Pierce as my favorite Hammer landlord. Yvonne Monlaur, on the other hand, is embarrassingly weak as the leading lady in distress. What makes this movie special to me though, is not the famous windmill-climax but the very atmospheric birdview shots of Peel standing on the balcony, chained around one ankle. When I first saw ""Brides"" on TV as a kid, this single one image of a man standing alone on a castle balcony, was so powerful it would haunt me for many years to come. Most of the movie had pretty much disappeared from my memory, except for the balcony scene. Only watching the movie years later, did I to much joy rediscover it. All in all, a wonderful vampire movie and well worth at least 3 stars. I give it 4 though, because it's nice to look at, and for those nostalgic reasons. Hammer movies aren't supposed to be logical of course, but meant as pure delighful escapism.

This is another one of Peter Cushing's patented Van Helsing roles, which proves he was the definitive vampire hunter in my book.  As much as you have to like Lee's presence as Dracula, ""The Brides of Dracula"" (the title is taken from a Stoker short story), his interpretation of the Count did place limitations on his films.

It is so well written, directed, and acted that the absence of Christopher Lee as Dracula doesn't detract from the film at all!  Peter Cushing is nothing short of  magnificent in his role as Van Helsing.  In fact, I think this movie may  have been his greatest performance ever.  The actress who plays the servant  at the castle is also great.  Her scenes as the insane servant of the  vampire are so good that I can only compare them to Dwight Frye's  performance as Renfeld in the original Dracula starring Bela Lugosi.  The  sets in this movie are breathtaking, and the action scenes are riveting.  There is not a dull moment in this one!  This is Hammer at its best.  See  it now!",963273600,6,742,4.385185185185185

7827200,2,6302503507,"As with all adaptations of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" the Hammer movie ""Horror of Dracula"" ended with Dracula dying. Hard to continue menacing the world when you're a pile of ashes.

So how could Hammer produce a Dracula sequel when the famed count is no more? Produce a barely-related movie called ""Brides of Dracula,"" which does not have Dracula or his brides -- it simply has Van Helsing squaring off against a far less impressive vampire, with the sporadic assistance of a woman so stupid she is unable to remember what happened the previous day. As always, Peter Cushing is absolutely magnificent as Van Helsing, but the rest of the movie is a tedious, paint-by-numbers vampire movie.

Young Frenchwoman Marianne Danielle (Yvonne Monlaur) is on her way to teach in a remote Transylvanian girls' school, but ends up stranded in a remote mountain village. She accepts the invitation of the eccentric Baroness Meinster (Martita Hunt) to stay in her castle overnight, but immediately becomes entangled with the Baroness' son, who is imprisoned in a neighboring part of the castle. He convinces Marianne to free him, which she does... because she's an idiot who blindly does whatever attractive men tell her to do.

Surprise surprise, the young Baron (David Peel) is actually a vampire who immediately kills his mother, with the help of an insane servant who seems to think crazy laughter is the answer to every problem. Marianne is rescued by Van Helsing (Cushing) who whisks her off to her destination, before doubling back to the village to deal with their vampire problem. Unfortunately the Baron is already getting his own harem of white-gowned brides, just like Dracula -- and he's determined to make Marianne one of them. As she has the brains of a lobotomized squirrel, she has absolutely no problem marrying a man who murdered his own mother.

I can only imagine the disappointment of audiences who watches ""Brides of Dracula"" and discovered that it contained no Christopher Lee, no Dracula, and no brides of Dracula. There are brides, but they're not Dracula's brides. In fact, there is very little in this movie that actually ties it to the legendary story of Dracula, or even to the previous movie adaptation. Except for a couple of vague mentions of Dracula, the only connection is Van Helsing himself, and he is presented so generically that the character would be unchanged if he were renamed.

In fact, ""generic"" is perhaps the best term to describe the entire plot of this movie. Little about it is actually memorable or unique -- most of the story is made up of cliches rewarmed and recycled from ""Horror of Dracula"" -- aristocratic vampire preying on a little Romanian village (where most of the inhabitants sound extremely British), with a damsel he's targeting and a knowledgeable vampire hunter. The only unique aspect is the Baroness, a rather tragic figure whose relentless indulgence of her son leads to him becoming a monster, and in turn transforming her into one as well.

As usual, Peter Cushing gives a practically flawless performance as Van Helsing -- he comes across as warm and kind to everyone he comes across, and he easily dominates every scene without being overbearing. There's even a rather brutal scene where Van Helsing gets bitten, and uses some rather unorthodox treatments to avoid becoming a vampire.

Unfortunately, Van Helsing is not the only main character. Instead of Dracula, we have the Baron Meinster... so rather than an ancient, ruthless warlord, we have a spoiled rich brat whose mommy let him hang out with the bad kids until one of them turned him into a vampire. Not exactly threatening. He's very much a generic vampire without much actual presence, and doesn't seem to have any of the cunning necessary to actually DO anything.

To make matters worse, Marianne is one of the stupidest heroines I've ever seen in a movie -- not only does she constantly show a complete lack of common sense (when told the Baron is dangerously insane, she immediately tries to free him), but she somehow manages to forget everything she saw and heard after her first encounter with the Baron... including Van Helsing's whole explanation about what was going on. When the Baron pops up again, she looks mildly confused in an airheaded way, but is apparently happy to see him. Monlaur's bizarrely affected performance doesn't exactly help a character who seems destined to be a Darwin award.

""Brides of Dracula"" has no Dracula, no brides of Dracula, and no point. The one saving grace is the presence of the ever-amazing Peter Cushing, but even his return as Van Helsing is not enough to save this poorly-plotted clucker.",1446768000,,4660,4.933673469387755

7827204,4,6302503507,"A beautiful young schoolteacher is seduced by the charming Baron Meinster, never knowing that he is one of Dracula's many servants. Luckily for her, Doctor Van Helsing has set out to Castle Meinster to stop the vampire lord before he can spread his evil throughout the land. Hammer's first sequel in the DRACULA series lacks the Count altogether, but for a few brief references throughout the film. Christopher Lee's reluctance to reprise the role does not prevent director Terence Fisher from turning out another successful vampire picture, with much due (of course) to Peter Cushing's ongoing performance as Doctor Van Helsing. The film features many inspired moments, including a suspenseful scene where one of the vampire's intended victims stares tremblingly into her empty bedside mirror as the camera slowly creeps back to reveal the fanged Baron. Featuring a rousing score by Malcolm Williamson, more lavish set designs by Bernard Robinson, and another outstanding cast, BRIDES OF DRACULA serves as another excellent entry in the Hammer vault.

7827205,2,6302503507,"The Brides of Dracula, 1960 film

The film begins in Transylvania, the land of dark forests, in the late 19th century. Not so fast says the young woman passenger to the coachman. There is a body in the road! A man jumps onto the coach. This woman travels alone, and is abandoned at an inn. No room at this inn, she must continue her journey. But an older woman enters the inn. The young woman, Mlle. Marianne Danielle, is a teacher and is invited to spend a night at the castle with the Baroness. Did she see a young man in the courtyard? Yes, the Baroness son is ill and must be locked up; people believe he is dead. Mlle. Danielle has a restless night. Who are you? He is chained to limit his movement! Baron Meinster explains his situation and asks Mlle. Danielle to find the key to release him from the chain. Will this have unforseen consequences?

Mother, come here! Later there is mad laughter in the castle. Greta shows Mlle. Danielle the body of the Baroness, then explains the history of the son. Mlle. Danielle flees the castle and is found by Doctor Van Helsing. A young beautiful girl was found dead in the forest. [Why was she out alone at night?] There are marks on her neck! Dr. Van Helsing questions Mlle. Danielle about her purpose in traveling. The village priest doesnt want the girl buried in the churchyard. Van Helsing explains how vampires survive and increase. These colonies of vampires must be exterminate with a stake through the heart. Van Helsing watches as the dead girl rises from her coffin! Where did that bat come from? Van Helsing visits the Chteau Meinster and finds the young Baron and his mother (who is long in the tooth). There is one release.

The young Baron visits Marianne to bring her luggage left at the castle. He is all alone in that big house. Herr Lang returns, the Baron announces an engagement. I wish it had been me says Gina. The Baron has arrived! As dawn breaks Van Helsing gets his mallet and stake, his working tools. The Baroness is released. Another girl is found dead at the school! Van Helsing will see this patient without compensation. He gives orders to Herr Lang to watch the coffin. The Baron has been there! That night the horses are restless. Later Gina arises and talks to Marianne. Van Helsing talks to Marianne to learn where the Baron is. At the mill the Baron and his victims attack Van Helsing. There is a struggle, Van Helsing loses. But he knows how to treat his wound! Dont look at his eyes. Holy water drives the Baron away, and he knocks over hot coals to start a fire. Van Helsing saves Marianne from the Baron, and puts him down. And so all ends well.

This is basically a plodding movie with some good parts. It lacks a good story and runs on too long. While this is set in Transylvania the historic Vlad Dracula was a Warlord (or Count) of Wallachia. He is famous as the only European ruler to defeat the Sultan Mehmet II of Turkey, and was lauded by the Bishop of Rome. Dracula is a national hero in Rumania. Bram Stokers novel Dracula was translated into every European language except Rumanian. The word vampire is of Slavic origin, the Rumanian word is strigoi. The oldest known writings about a vampire is in The Epic of Gilgamesh from ancient Mesopotamia.",1315267200,,3246,4.505942275042445
7827206,5,6302503507,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.

The Brides Of Dracula (1960) is one of Hammer's best vampire movies and one of their best movies, period.  Peter Cushing is the star of the show, playing Van Helsing once more and doing a great job.  He's all business as the vampire hunter and very athletic.  In this movie, Dracula is nowhere to be found.  Absent.  Gone.  He was turned to dust in Horror Of Dracula (1958).  So, this movie does not have Christopher Lee in it.  However, this doesn't make this less of a movie.  The vampire that's in this movie does a good job.  I feel that this movie is actually BETTER than its predecessor from 1958.  I think its atmosphere is slightly better.  The plot/storyline is solid overall.  The musical score by Malcolm Williamson  is pretty good, especially during the opening credits.

All in all, a very solid vampire movie (or should I say Dracula movie) that I highly recommend.",1301529600,,985,4.568965517241379
