3529855,4,B001DHXT52,"I would give this show 10 stars if I could, but as previous reviewers have pointed out, CBS/Paramount has given The Odd Couple such disrespect with their DVD releases (Season One was originally released by Time-Life). Every season from 2 thru 5 has been clipped and chopped just to avoid the chance that music royalties might have to be paid, yet they have the nerve to charge $40 for each season and still give us edits and complete scene removals. Boy what a gyp! So far I have noticed 3 big edits in Season 5 (and I'm sure there are more): In ""Strike Up The Band or Else"", Felix and later Billy Joe sing ""Cocktails For Two"" - CUT....In ""The Subway Show"", Felix and Scatman Crothers sing ""Give My Regards To Broadway"" - CUT...and in ""Your Mother Wears Army Boots"", Martina Arroyo sings ""For Once In My Life"" - CUT.  In ""Two Men On A Hoarse"", after Felix regains his voice he sings Together, Wherever You Go while still tied as he and Oscar hop in their chairs - CUT. Maybe someday, there will be complete episodes, but for now we are at the mercy of blood sucking corporate greed.",1230854400,14,1082,4.41
3529856,3,B001DHXT52,"Less 2 stars due solely to the editing of content.
I am in complete agreement with other buyers about the edits and I use the word ""complete"" literally, unlike Paramount/CBS when they say ""The COMPLETE Final Season"". In a previous season, an entire gag about trying to get Felix to go to sleep (featuring the song ""Dream"") was cut. This season, one of my favorite episodes, ""Strike up the band or else..."" had gags cut involving the song ""In Some Secluded Rendezvous""(sung twice in the show by Tony Randall and Pernell Roberts). How expensive can these songs be that you have to butcher these episodes. Charge a little extra with the guarantee that all the episodes are intact and you'll sell just as many if not more.",1230422400,39,718,4.661417322834645
3529857,5,B001DHXT52,I bought this DVD because my husband is a hugh fan of the odd couple.  We now own all 5 seasons.  He watches them over and over again.  The quality is great.  So much better than watch the re-runs on TV.,1229817600,2,203,3.8780487804878048

3529859,4,B001DHXT52,"Another song edited out. The episode ""Your Mother Wears Army Boots"" has Martina Arroyo sing For Once In Your Life to Howard Cosell at the end, with Oscar lip-synching along with her in a very nice moment in the show. The edits are very fustrating.  These are supposed to be DVDs of the complete episodes. If there is time and place to show them complete and intact it should be in this format.  I'll admit...all throughout the five seasons DVD's I have noticed they added little snippets of scenes I never saw on TV during syndication, but I think Paramount loses credit when they edit out other parts.",1228089600,31,602,4.564814814814815
3529860,3,B001DHXT52,"Sadly, the worst edit of all was removing Oscar's ""Singing In the Rain"" bit at the end of the scene in ""Felix Remarries""  Five to ten seconds of this song was too expensive to leave in the show?  It completely changes changes.",1227484800,32,226,4.357142857142857

After reading all the reviews about cuts, I got each volume separately.  I did notice one or two but they did not interfere with the joke or humor of the episode.  LOOK AT THE PRICE!  They will soon be pulling it from manufacture.  It's been out since 2008 and it's made it's money.  It will no longer be worth it to keep making it to only sell a few.
Don't get me wrong----Sony never should have advertised it as complete.  As to the episode 'Strike up the band-or else'---they did cut the entire song by Pernell Roberts (it is still copyrighted and they did not want to pay)  HOWEVER--THERE IS A SILVER CLOUD---Go to YouTube, type in the Odd Couple and one of the choices is Full Episodes.  It's the second selection on page 2.  I forwarded it to just before the end and it's all there--full screen--no commercials--I guess it was from a bootleg.  Quality and sound is just as good.  I hope this makes some complainers happy.  And, I would guess, that if there are any other that are really chopped--they will be there also.",1410134400,,1179,4.5

Both Klugman and Randall won Emmys in the leads, the latter in this final year of this shows 1970-75 run on ABC, despite the fact that the ratings took a turn for the worst which was probably also due to Klugman & Randall running out of steam after doing this show for 5 years along with the fact that THE ODD COUPLE only had mediocre ratings & was never part of the Top 25 in the Nielsen ratings.

3529899,5,B001DHXT52,"There's a lot in store during this Fifth & Final Season of ""The Odd Couple"", as Oscar & guest-star Howard Cosell are at it again in the episode ""Your Mother Wears Army Boots"". Felix gets Oscar an announcing spot on Monday Night Football with hilariously tedious results. It's rather surprising that a home-grown product such as Oscar can get sick of an exciting metropolis like New York, so Felix tries to convince Oscar how much fun the city can be in the episode ""The Subway Story"". Musicians Paul Williams & Roy Clack guest-star in respective episodes. In ""The Paul Williams Story"", Felix's daughter runs away to attend Paul's concert in Albany, & in ""The Roy Clark Story"", Oscar's army buddy ""Wild"" Willie Boggs is in town for a visit, & immediately gets on Felix's last nerve, courtesy of Willie's silly pranks. Felix turns him into a concert virtuoso, which doesn't sit well with Oscar. An increase in rent has the tenants upset, so Felix leads a picketing protest in ""The Rent Strike"". Guest-star John Byner convinces Felix to get Oscar to appear in a weight-loss diet supplement commercial in ""The Bigger They Are"" - where Oscar poses in a fat suit! Oscar gets Felix's band to appear at a ""hoe-down"", where they play country music - another hilarious episode that's titled ""Strike Up The Band, Or Else""! Richard Dawson appears in ""Laugh Clown, Laugh"", & all's well that ends well, as Oscar finally gets Felix to remarry Gloria in the finale, ""Felix Remarries"". What do you know, Oscar's a bachelor again! After five successful seasons & 114 episodes, the ""Odd Couple"" comes to a close.

This was some of the best work for both and the world deserves to see their chemistry as they originally intended it to be seen. P'mount will find a whole new audience waiting to purchase these, so it would be worth their while to do so.

3529905,2,B001DHXT52,"Like many of the other posters here, I'm disgusted that Paramount edited these episodes out of fear of litigation because some of the episodes include musical numbers which they could conceivably be sued for for using without permission. I bought season 5 because the price was half that of the other seasons, and I guess I was thinking that a chopped up Odd Couple was better than none at all. Right away, upon watching the collection, I noticed an edit. In the ""subway"" episode,(the first of the season) Scatman Crothers' musical number is completely cut out. In the episode where Oscar has throat surgery, Felix' singing of ""Together Wherever We Go"" is cut out.
 Like others here have said, i'm awaiting the day when this brilliant series will be released intact, the way it was shown when originally aired. And why doesn't Paramount put a disclaimer on the set indicating that these are edited versions of the episodes? sneaky how they quietly edit them and present them as ""complete"", as if we won't notice.",1356048000,4,1012,4.816091954022989
3529906,3,B001DHXT52,"I'm torn as to how to review this, but I have to be honest.  The producers of this set chopped up the episodes terribly...it wasn't even good editing.  It was obvious that something was missing off many of the episodes. There was at least one that kind of just stopped and that was it (the end of the episode)! I remember watching The Odd Couple as a child but didn't remember any of the episodes, specifically.  In my quest to build a nice family collection of DVDs, I purchased this set, even knowing that they were chopped up (that's the only way I can think to describe them), from reading other reviews.  I wanted to see them so desperately.  But I would not recommend their purchase to others.  I feel my money was wasted.  It's not Oscar & Felix's fault, but the fault of whoever decided to ruin a great classic show by cutting and editing this season...to death.",1353888000,5,870,4.433962264150943

At times there is so much cut that the episodes lose some of their best comedic elements.  Seriously Paramount, is this the best you can do?

The Odd Couple no longer airs on TV nationwide but it does air locally in my area.  I'll watch it in syndication and boycott the DVDs.  I'm tired of the studios blowing TV releases, especially the classics.  It was perfect in the '70s, and now it's messed up.  Totally unacceptable.",1311379200,10,575,4.504854368932039

For example, in the episode ""Strike Up the Band Or Else,"" Oscar persuades Felix to play at a charity dance, but before Oscar gets to the apartment, Felix's band, ""The Sophisticatos,"" sing their theme song. Sadly, this is one of the parts they cut out. I really wanted to show my daughter that part! I think that Paramount should create a DVD set that includes ALL of the deleted scenes. Besides, a DVD can hold tons of footage compared to a VHS, so that shouldn't be a problem. Another thing that bothered me was that I saw one TV station showing the same episode with all of the deleted scenes in it.

3529925,4,B001DHXT52,"For five eclectic seasons, Tony Randall and Jack Klugman starred in the television version of The Odd Couple (1970-75), a deliciously sophisticated adult comedy, characterized by wonderfully hip writing.  Although others had portrayed neatfreak photographer Felix Unger, and the slovenly sportswriter Oscar Madison, including Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau, in the 1968 film adaptation of Neil Simon's play, Randall as Unger, and Klugman as Madison, succeeded in putting their unique mark on their characters, truly making them their own.

The final season features many of the series' familiar elements.  With the end of the series in sight, attempts are made to tie up some loose ends, as well as conclude the series in a memorable way.  Al Molinaro (Happy Days) returns as loveable Murray the cop, and Elinor Donohue (The Andy Griffith Show) appears a few times as Felix's girlfriend Miriam.  There is a nice variety of notable guest stars, including Richard Dawson, Dick Cavett, Albert Paulsen, Pernell Roberts, Garo Yepremian, Victor Buono, and Neil Simon.

Here's some of what happens in the final season:

After receiving tips from Felix on how to become more alluring, Oscar's secretary Myrna Turner (Penny Marshall) gets married in the season opening ""The Rain In Spain Falls Mainly In Vain"".  Myrna quits her job, but later returns to appear in several more episodes.

Things are getting serious between Oscar and a widow (Dina Merrill) with two kids in ""Oscar In Love"".  The couple plans to wed, but sadly marital bliss is not is not the cards for Oscar, in this is his only major romantic entanglement in the final season.

Multi-talented Roy Clark guests as Oscar's army buddy in ""The Roy Clark Show"".  Clark plays some hot country fiddle, but Felix tries to channel his talents toward classical music.  The episode concludes with Clark's fantastic guitar playing.

In ""The Hollywood Story"", the boys head out to Tinsel Town where Oscar is to appear in a movie.  Acting as his manager, Felix butts in, and messes things up.  While viewing homes of the stars, the New Yorkers run into Bob Hope taking out his trash.

Future teen idol Leif Garrett, guests as Felix's son Leonard in ""The Frog"".  Oscar is left in charge of Leonard's pet frog, who escapes just before a big jumping contest.

""Your Mother Wears Army Boots"" is the big celebrity episode, featuring opera singer Martina Arroyo, sports broadcasting legend Howard Cosell, and the abrasive comedian Jack Carter.  After Felix arranges for Cosell to hear Martina sing, Howie helps arrange for Oscar to join him in the Monday Night Football broadcast booth.  Seeking verbal ammunition against Cosell, Oscar consults a comic played by Carter for some witty insults.

In ""The Dog Story"", John Fiedler is the abusive trainer of Silver, a dog in show business.  Felix is hired to photograph the collie, and decides to rescue him.  Oscar becomes an accomplice in the crime, and the guys wind up in court accused of theft.

Oscar has a source at the track providing tips about winners.  Felix gets sucked into betting on the ponies, and living the high life, in ""Felix The Horseplayer"".

""The Paul Williams Story"" features pop the singer as himself.  When Felix's daughter Edna (Doney Oatman) is unable to attend his concert in New York, she runs away to Albany to work as a waitress in a club where Williams is performing.

In ""Felix Remarries"", Janis Hansen returns as Felix's ex-wife Gloria, and after seeing that finicky Felix is determined to change, she agrees to take him back.  With water leaking from the ceiling due to a plumbing problem, the couple remarries in Oscar's apartment.  And so after five outrageously funny years, this delightful series comes to an end, with Felix Unger and Oscar Madison both very happy men.

Together, Tony Randall and Jack Klugman had a unique and amazing synergy that made them a joy to watch.  To many, they are the definitive Felix and Oscar.  There are no extra features or commentary tracks in this set, which is unfortunate as Klugman, executive producer Gary Marshall, and his sister Penny Marshall were available at the time of release.  It is also evident that as in previous seasons, some musical numbers have unfortunately been cut.

Immediately after The Odd Couple, Jack Klugman would change gears, and find great success in the TV crime drama Quincy (1976-83), as a crusading medical examiner.  Randall would remain in comedy, with The Tony Randall Show (1976-78).  Randall and Klugman would reprise their roles once more in 1993, in the made for TV movie, The Odd Couple: Together Again.  Tony Randall passed away in 2004, at the age of 84.  Jack Klugman developed throat cancer, affecting his speaking voice in the late 80's.",1294099200,2,4744,4.970812182741117

There are definitely other cuts throughout the series.

I am going to return Season 4 unopened rather than take the risk of getting stuck like I did with Season 5.",1240185600,7,489,4.268817204301075
3529944,1,B001DHXT52,"First off let me say I love the Odd Couple series but not this DVD. As a kid me & my brother use to watch it faithfully growing up. I still remember the scenes that are about to coming up...that is until they edited the crap out this last season.
After watching the first disc which I counted a total of 3 edits. It took me 3 months before I even played the 2nd disc. Which was worse than the first disc. I was surprised they didn't edit out the Paul Williams episode which has a number of songs. I think if they did it would of been a 5 minute episode. It's a real shame because they are one of the greatest comedy teams. Too many edits I am totally (edit)...",1238284800,19,660,4.007575757575758
3529945,5,B001DHXT52,"I have been watching The Odd Couple since I was a young girl, and with age the hilarity has only increased. Sure, they were funny to watch when I was a 7th grader, but now that I'm an adult I find that the comedy only packs an even bigger punch. Jack Klugman is perfect as Oscar, the ever-sloppy roommate who is constantly being pestered by Felix, Tony Randall, the ever-fastidious one. They are type-cast, and it's a wonderful combination made better because they are (or, in Tony's case, were) wonderfully talented actors in their own rite. There's nothing like a good Odd Couple episode to put me in a good mood. I have all five seasons now and they always make me laugh, even after all these years.",1237248000,7,702,4.4921875
3529946,5,B001DHXT52,You simply can't go wrong with one of the greatest TV comedy teams of all time: Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. Great story lines and guest stars (even Paul Williams!). This is definitely a series I can watch over and over again.,1236556800,2,228,4.4523809523809526
3529947,1,B001DHXT52,"After receiving the first season as a gift, I purchased the second.  I will NOT purchase any more until the desecration stops!  I would love to know where I could write to express my disgust over the cutting of these precious moments.  Somehow I don't think the sellers/producers would appreciate being paid a percentage of the price because you only get a percentage of each episode.  Until the hatchet work is replaced by the ENTIRE episode I won't be spending any more money!!!",1235692800,20,480,4.746987951807229
3529948,3,B001DHXT52,"I bought this set because I already have seasons 1 - 4 and wanted to complete my collection. Like everyone else I'm ticked about the missing music segments.  OK, Paramount didn't want to pay for these songs, but did they even have to?  I would think that most (if not all) this stuff would be in Public Domain by now - the songs were old when 'Odd Couple' used them in the 70s.  So what's the deal...?",1235606400,8,401,4.181818181818182
3529949,5,B001DHXT52,The Odd Couple was a great show!  All the seasons are great and I would say (as this is the last season) that Oscar and Felix went out on a high note.,1235433600,,150,3.6875
3529950,1,B001DHXT52,"this final season video stinks to high hell.why does it have to be severely edited .the best parts of the episodes is to see it in its complete form.if i knew it was severly edited like this i would have never purchased it. ""I FEEL CHEATED"" WHAT A GYP. THE SCENE WITH PERNELL ROBERTS SINGING WAS EDITED OUT AND MY FAVORITE PART OF OSCAR SINGING, SINGING IN THE RAIN WHEN HE WAS FINALLY RID OF FELIX WAS CUT OUT. WHY DO THAT TO US  ODD COUPLE DIE HARDS .WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE COMPLETE EPISODES. I FOR ONE AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS FINAL EPISODES CD. IT STINKS TO HELL.not recommended till deleted scenes are put back in.

WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY????  I FELT CHEATED AND WANTED TO RETURN MY SET.  TIME-LIFE DID THE BEST JOB OF PUTTING OUT ANY SET OF THE ODD COUPLE EXCEPT FOR THE DVD CASE. I AM GLAD THIS IS THE LAST SET AS I WOULD NOT BUY ANY MORE FROM PARAMOUNT/CBS.  SHAME ON YOU!,1231286400,11,441,3.9101123595505616
3529952,3,B001DHXT52,"Much like the rest of the video series, I found this last volume disappointing. Some episodes were shortened due to video time constraints (and this is without any extras), which cut my enthusiasm. I don't know what Paramount was thinking, but they should re-release new volumes showing the episodes in their entirety. Had I known this was going to be the case for the series, I might not have purchased them, even as a long time fan of the Odd Couple waiting for the series to be released.",1231286400,8,490,4.579545454545454

8293354,4,B001DHXT52,Tony Randall and Jack Klugman are still in top form in the final season of the show. It is still funny but I still think the previous seasons were better. I think the people behind the scenes were running out of ideas and it shows. I am still very happy with my purchase because I now have the series in its entirety.,1486771200,,317,4.129032258064516
