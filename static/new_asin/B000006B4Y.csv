This was definitely not Candid Camera in a normal sense, but being made by the same mind/genius, had certain elements that were similar...in a way.  It was very interesting to see the change in attitudes from the big issues of that era.  Really enjoyed this movie overall.",1462579200,,392,4.8059701492537314
1192760,4,B000006B4Y,"Funny, racy, and eye opening uncensored Candid Camera movie. Definitely worth a look at attitudes toward love and sex in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The second Candid Camera film, ""Money Talks"" was more for general audiences and rated PG.

1192771,5,B000006B4Y,Really worth watching for several reasons. I like the very real slice of 1969 American society it depicts. Since the interviews are with real people and across an age and geographical spectrum it gives a great slice of the era.  Also some of the social experiments Alan Funt sets up are so real and useful. Especially the one with the 4 men in a room and then a 5th enters the area. Cool experiment on human nature.,1456876800,,415,4.3896103896103895

1192773,3,B000006B4Y,"I remember watching Funt's Candid Camera in the 1960's and enjoyed the set-up situations a lot.
Here in the early days of the MPAA and loosening of restrictive sexual mores, it is an interesting time capsule.  I believe most of the interviews following the situations are honest and real and I found these to be a good window into the thoughts and responses of people of that period.
The only odd episode was the man who is in a pharmacy with the back of a female salesperson to the camera.  It doesn't seem to have a purpose.  Perhaps it was trimmed prior to or after initial release.",1456704000,,585,4.4485981308411215

1192785,1,B000006B4Y,"Horrible film, but may be worth watching because of the attitudes. Alan Funt has little that may be streamed so others may just want to see it because he did it. Completely amateurish without the cleverness of Hidden Camera.",1449100800,,224,4.769230769230769

1192792,5,B000006B4Y,It was interesting to see the film again after so many years and to observe myself in it. I was so spacey. The Village Voice reviewer had noticed my part in the film especially. What fun!,1441152000,,187,4.222222222222222

1192801,2,B000006B4Y,"I felt a better job could have been done in casting the women who would be seen without their clothes on. Something about their appearance made it seem vulgar to me.  True, this is an old movie.  Yes Allen Funt was a real hoot on Candid Camera, but this movie reveals another side to him.  He was probably a real pervert just like a lot of Hollywood types.  I didn't like this movie so much, that I didn't even bother watching it to it's conclusion.  On the up side, it was basically free to watch, so the only thing wasted was my time as I grew increasingly skeptical and critical looking at it till I finally hit 'Stop.'

Bottom Line:  I think it's garbage and should be treated as such, left in the archives for historical purposes only in order to reference films in  bad-taste.",1433721600,,782,4.344827586206897

1192835,3,B000006B4Y,Candid Camera in the nude. The movie had its funny moments. It was more about how people react to seeing complete strangers in buff. Alan Funt was a master at getting people to face situations that they never imagined they would get into and he was so good at it that he caught people on camera that swore it would never happen to them.

However, the risqu situation was mostly the same: a naked woman in public. There was a couple of other bits but for the most part the candid bit was naked women. Then there was the talking: Alan Funt talking to people what pornography is, what prostitution is, why nudity is wrong, etc. It gets old quick and the music doesn't help.

Watched this out of curiosity having grown up during the Candid Camera on TV era.  Although there were three or four skits with naked women and one with a male (total frontal nudity) the title is misleading since the movie was more about measuring people's reaction to watching these skits.

I like the playfulness and innocence of this movie ... and to think this was an X rated
movie when it came out in 1970.
I was a kid in 1970 and never got to see this, and later would never to think to watch
it because I just thought it would be silly, but it is cute and endearing and very interesting.
I think Allen Funt had the right idea ... I so much would rather see real people exposing
something real about themselves than all the computer-animated, explosive, violent
and nasty movies we see these days.
I'm very happy I watched this for free on Amazon Prime ... thank you Amazon.",1374192000,,676,4.2890625
1192852,5,B000006B4Y,"I remember when this movie first came out and I watched it for the first time.  I was surprised that the various actresses who appeared nude in the movie agreed to do it.  But I suppose back then, they didn't have any inhibitions about doing this movie and to them it was just another paycheck.  What I like is that what happened as a result of this movie is that Allen Funt decided to do more by doing what he called ""Candid Candid Camera"" stunts that incorporated what he did in the movie and made it for direct-to-video access.  Its too bad that Vestron Video(the company that originally produced the VHS copies of this movie) will not or cannot make DVD copies so that the general public can purchase them.  (I believe there are at least 6 volumes of the ""Candid Candid Camera"" series on VHS and Vestron Video should try and put them on DVD).",1372032000,6,846,4.397435897435898

1192856,5,B000006B4Y,"Would you rather hear a lecture on sex from a stuffy professorial type or a nude statuesque blonde with a beehive hairdo?  Allen Funt, host and creator of TV's ""Candid Camera"", proves to be a genial tour guide that is America's minefield of the birds and bees.  There are any number of amusing stunts on hand here but there are two segments that prove indelible.  One concerns interviews with people about interracial relationships.  Another is interviews with teenagers about their sexual experiences.  I don't know what's sadder the kids' misconceptions or their parents' reactions to what their offspring are saying.  I was expecting a dated exercise but Funt's film is timeless because as much as things have changed so little hasn't.  This was originally slapped with the ""X"" rating but today it would be borderline ""PG-13"".  For you ladies out there it's not only female nudity on display.  Funt throws you a bone by including a segment involving a nude male artist's model.  Look quick for Richard Roundtree.",1328400000,12,1015,4.988095238095238
1192857,4,B000006B4Y,"There's not much to say about the actual film. It's dated, and represents a time in society that has passed; something like this could not be done today. For this reason, it remains a curiosity. It's also not nearly as raunchy or explicit as it's reputation makes it to be. It does have frequent nudity, male and female, but it's not done salaciously - tasteful, if you will. It's almost done in an innocent way.

Now for the DVD - for the first time (in the US, anyway), it is presented in it's original aspect ratio, 1.85:1, and is 16x9 enhanced. The picture quality is quite stunning. I could not tell if this was a matted presentation, or if it opens up from the (assumed) panned-and-scanned VHS full-frame version, but the framing looks good here. The only extra is it's original theatrical trailer.",1326153600,8,804,4.6223776223776225

1192859,3,B000006B4Y,"I would like to know how to get the European version of this film on a DVD that will play

the ""Bible Belt"" version is the woman in an office in Greenwich Village interviewing a gay
man.  The version we saw in college, which we were TOLD was the European version had a
really beautiful woman wearing nothing but red, white and blue body paint.  The Bible Belt
version has a different woman wearing shorts and a top with a small tattoo or painted area
on her back. The body paint scene was the most beautiful moment in the film, but is omitted
from the ""Bible Belt"" version, which I accidentally purchased from my satellite provider.
So, how do you get the good version?",1312156800,6,758,4.438848920863309
1192860,4,B000006B4Y,"FOR ADULTS ONLY! Originally given a ""X"" rating. Now Rated ""R"". Running Time: 85 mins.
  We all remember the Candid Camera tv series which has been shown on and off since 1960-2004. It was originally known as ""Candid Microphone"" in 1948-49, 1951-52. Very popular on television in the 1960's and 1970's.
  This show was about a hidden television camera being set up and a practical joke being played on unsuspected real people that walk in by random. For example, a man would walk in to a cafe and sit on the stool to order some soup. Just as he begins to sip the soup with a spoon, the seat begins to lower. Everyone knew who Alan Funt was, the host of ""Candid Camera"", so when they saw him come out and he says ""Smile, Your on Candid Camera"", they knew it was a practical joke. They would then see themselves on television at a later date. (This is not in the movie).
 They never let a light, simple joke go too far or too long. To end the farce, the person was always told they were on ""Candid Camera"" and shown where the camera was.

  This movie is ""Candid Camera"" for adults only as it contains female frontal nudity and male frontal nudity with frank conversations about sex.
  The first joke is played at random on people who stand at an elevator. Suddenly a naked woman comes out and stands to ask them a question. The shock on the people's faces is priceless.
  Another joke is played where Alan Funt is disguised and talks to a woman in a room. There is a painting of a nude male on an easel.
 Alan excuses himself and says he will be back in a moment.
 A naked man enters the room. It is the male model in the painting. He sits in his position. The woman sees everything. Will she look at him or look away out of politeness? Every woman has different manners.
  Their are many practical jokes here and over 100 people are surprised.
  The great thing about Alan Funt was he was a great host and good at conversation with people. Always a gentleman, but Right On!

 Another great segment is you will hear middle-aged and mature senior men and woman share their opinions about sex, a naked statue - should it have a fig leaf or not, and nudity and sex in movies, including this movie. Remember, this is 1969.

 Another joke is senior citizens see a couple kissing, however this is a black man kissing a white woman in public. Is it right or wrong? Is it shocking? The seniors will give you their opinion.
Richard Roundtree ( before ""Shaft"") is the black man with the white girl.

 Filmed in Miami, Florida.

 Followed by: Money Talks (1972).

 Another adult version by Alan Funt titled ""Candid Candid Camera"" was broadcast on HBO and Playboy Channel in 1982-87.

 I don't think you could do ""Candid Camera"" today as the times are different and people are different. We live in a fast-paced world, some people have become less tolerant and people are in a hurry to get somewhere. Hidden cameras are everywhere now...and Alan Funt has left us.

  On September 5, 1999, Alan Funt passed away at the age of 84. He had become incapacitated after a stroke in 1993.

 His son, Peter Funt, hosted with his father in 1987. Peter continued ""Candid Camera"" on television in 1996 with tv specials for the next 8 years.

 After 56 years of surprising people, Candid Camera came to an end in 2004.

 Candid Camera is now online at its own official website and is also seen on GMC - Gospel Music Channel.

  With America it is very much a guilty pleasure, something that should be hidden.
As it works out, American movies that portray movie violence i.e. shootings, death and torture as the norm and Sex and nudity as not normal have it backwards!
  This movie shows what is wrong in America, with some fun nudity in unusual places.
It is a breath of fresh air, the human body nude is natural! Bloody violence and death are not!!!

Sure, there's a lot of Candid Camera funny stuff about catching people ""being themselves"", but the fascinating thing to me is how this movie reveals what our attitudes were about sex back in the early 70's. I was awed how people dressed differently, talked differently, and basically had a whole different attitude than we have today. Plus it seemed like everybody smoked back then. I was about 20 back then so the first time I saw the movie everything seemed normal, except the ""daring"" parts, of course. In my second viewing all these years later I look at it more as a glimpse back at a different time in our history. Younger people will probably this movie sucks.

Watching it now 4 decades later, it brought back to mind how the movies of that era were going into uncharted waters with more permissive material. But all it is about is seeing naked bodies. Sex and nudity is just that: sex and nudity. A good engrossing well written and directed story and subject matter wins everytime. Allen Funt of the TV show Candid Camera, probably had this idea in his head for years. A hidden camera and staged naked actress captures very different responses from unsuspecting people.
