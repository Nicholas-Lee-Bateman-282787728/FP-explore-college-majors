3474755,5,B001AYWY6I,"This Pilates DVD is great!  I am a beginner at Pilates and found this DVD easy to follow, yet challenging enough to get a great work out.  The instructions were clear and every new move started slow and gradually got quicker.  The diversity of stretches and head to toe movements kept me interested and concentrated.  I felt a great stretching and lengthening as well as cardio work out throughout.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1222128000,40,438,4.786666666666667
3474756,5,B001AYWY6I,"Brooke is the only person who can keep my attention for 45 minutes! She does it by talking you through  every step of the workout with such calm, clear and helpful instructions. She really gets me to work my ""core"" and I end up  sweating and feeling  exhilarated everytime I do it.
She never stops talking you through the lesson, therefore you are able to stay focused. I cannot get that great of a workout from even private lessons at my club. Brooke's DVD is the best instruction tape I have ever purchased. Definitely buy this DVD. You will not be SORRY.",1221868800,35,557,4.4411764705882355
3474757,5,B001AYWY6I,"I'm a mother of 4, and this Pilates Weight Loss DVD is the perfect workout to do at home.  It's really helping me tone my saggy ""muffin-top"" waist area, while giving me the total stretching and strengthening I need.  The visual demonstrations are very clear, and the detailed verbal instructions give me all the coaching I need to work on improving my pilates technique.  This DVD is excellent as it's so easy to follow and has plenty of variation to keep me working out for months to come! It's amazing how these Pilates techniques, that make me feel so good by stretching my whole body, can really create a great cardio burn too.",1221523200,415,631,4.566371681415929
3474778,5,B001AYWY6I,"Having always been a workout maniac is what saved me from being crippled by recently diagnosed severe spine problems.  Pilates was not my workout of choice - I would do anything to avoid it - until now. Pilates is all about the core, the spine, back health, so I decided to give this video a try. No fancy moves, just a good core workout that loosens the spine and gives a lot of flexibility. Even with lower back scoliosis, I was able to do all poses without pain. She gives you an excellent warmup to prepare for the poses. I may have to live with this problem, but now I don't have to live with the pain. Thanks for a great DVD.",1517097600,3,631,4.172131147540983

3474783,1,B001AYWY6I,I really feel that this not a beginners Pilates work out.  She went way to fast and didn't explain what she was doing.  Plus the moves where very hard for a beginner.,1505088000,4,166,4.15625

3474786,5,B001AYWY6I,"Brooke Siler is the real deal, being a second generation J.H. Pilates instructor. And it shows. The standing workout is a hybrid of low impact aerobics and Pilates, and the mat version is pure Pilates. Straight, perfectly executed classic moves at a pace that works for all. For the reviewers who said it was too fast, I would remind them...this isn't live, it's a DVD...you can pause it, repeat, and go at your own pace.

If you are looking for someone who is not simply jumping on the Pilates band wagon, but who can teach you the essential core moves as Mr. Pilates intended, then Brooke can get you there. I particularly find her comparisons super useful in understanding exactly what we are supposed to be striving for with each move. From ""pretend there's a teacup on your knee and you don't want to spill it,"" to ""you're drawing circles on the ceiling with your foot,"" to ""you're painting the ceiling and the wall"" each one helps you visualize what you are doing so much better than any other instructor I've experienced.

I also highly recommend her Pilates book for a true understanding of the Pilates method and why it works.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pilates-Body-The-Ultimate-At-Home-Guide-to-Strengthening-Lengthening-and-Toning-Your-Body-Without-Machines/dp/076790396X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pilates Body: The Ultimate At-Home Guide to Strengthening, Lengthening and Toning Your Body- Without Machines</a>",1501372800,7,1480,5.7534246575342465
3474787,4,B001AYWY6I,"This review is from the Mrs.  I am 56 yrs old.  Let me just say it takes about 4 weeks to finally build your powerhouse so you are not straining your back.  Took me about 5-6 weeks to finally start seeing results and that's with doing the full workout 4 times a week.  It has been a few months now and I still enjoy it.  Just stick with it.  Hopefully will get up to an intermediate level soon.  Its a good workout, i feel great afterwards.",1500508800,2,440,4.046511627906977

3474799,5,B001AYWY6I,"I'm surprised it's a beginner's program but that just shows how much I needed this and how out of shape I am.  I thought I had pretty strong abs but I still have belly fat.  I hope I really will be kissing that goodbye now with regular use of this DVD.  I'm getting stronger.  This feels great.  This DVD is so good.  My only complaint about it is that the breathing is kind of hard to follow.  I've been doing this for about 3 weeks now and the breathing is getting easier.  She instructs you how to breathe and when to breathe in and out.  I'm used to that with yoga, but this is faster moving than yoga so it's a little challenging.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.",1496966400,4,679,4.114503816793893

3474828,3,B001AYWY6I,This Pilates DVD is very faced past not for beginners at all. It jumps right into from the beginning no explanation of the moves/techniques. If you are low-level active and have previously done Pilates then this past will be fast but nothing you cannot handle. For beginners it will be frustrating and difficult to keep up with. Luckily I have attended many Pilates classes and I was familiar with the techniques.,1489968000,,413,4.830985915492958

3474831,3,B001AYWY6I,"A bit fast paced considering it's a ""beginners"" video. Each time I try this video, I feel as though I'm playing catch up and right when I feel like I've gotten the move down she is already finishing the next move. It isn't aerobic fast, she just needs to let us catch up so we don't get frustrated.

3474849,5,B001AYWY6I,Very good. Easy to follow instructor but it took me a few times before I could get through the entire workout since I just started exercising. This was just what I was looking for to get me started. I feel it but it doesnt hurt me so bad that I don't want to do it anymore.,1486512000,2,273,3.892857142857143
3474850,2,B001AYWY6I,"It took me a long time to try this video. I am sure she is very skilled in her profession but this is not for beginners. I have been maintaining pretty good shape but wanted to incorporate more flexibility training innmy workout. The music is quick there is more metaphore (imagine you are sinking in a pool, your back is straight in a chair, your painting circles in the ceiling etc) and less specifics on form. Also tho in the introduction she speaks and gives her experience and testimony she has a voice over narration thru both cardio and the ab workout with nonstop talking. It was as another reviewer put it mentally exhausting. I had to keep craning my neck to see the tv to try and figure out the position i needed because there was not good realtime guidance. I may do this on occasion for some stretches but i found it tedious and I did not enjoy the music or her voice overs.",1486425600,,887,4.349397590361446

It's a good workout although at times the repetitiveness of the moves is a bit boring, its all part of the workout. I enjoy workouts that are more intense and faster.

3474873,4,B001AYWY6I,"An honest opinion is this is not easy for beginners. It is a good work out but a little too hard and not at a slow enough pace for someone who has never done pilates. I am in moderately good shape so I would assume it would be a little discouraging for someone who is not fit at all and would give this a try as the beginning of their journey to fitness.

If you're truly a Pilates beginner. with absolutely no experience with it, I would recommend Winsor Pilates for Beginners with Ana Caban; she walks you through the language, the technique, the breathing, and helps you focus on the parts of the body you're working in her 10 minute intro.

A beginner however cannot come straight up from a laying down position using abs though...I feel this move was just too advanced and she used it many times towards the middle to end of the workout.

The music is fast passed, & the narrator never stopped talking.  It's so distracting.  I switched over to the floor mat exercises, & it is the same way.  Plus, I do not think that this is for beginners.  Unless you are pretty in shape, it will be a struggle at times.  (If you truly are a beginner, I'd recommend The Biggest Loser Yoga).

3474997,4,B001AYWY6I,"This video gathered dust on my shelf for years -- I initially tried it and liked it...but felt I wasn't seeing weight loss results fast enough (most likely more because of my well-stocked fridge and bar than because of the merits of the instruction).

What a re-discovery. After about a month of doing just the standing prep work every morning, I lost about 2 inches on my waist and ten pounds -- and this is without being able to complete every single move every single time. My favorite feature of this video is that it is *all* low impact, however, I work up perspiration each time, and the breathing and stretching techniques stay with me throughout the day, improving my posture and leaving me feeling stronger. The instruction is also quite clear, but I do agree with another reviewer that the pace is quite fast; however, once I went through the routine for a week, it became easier to follow along. At times, it also doesn't seem as though it's for beginners, as Brooke Siler proceeds through each move at its fullest extension -- like the expert she is -- I can't yet duplicate that, but I don't let it put me off -- practice makes perfect!

Bottom line, this video actually helped me to start losing weight and build muscle tone more quickly than a very popular 'So-and-So-Day Fix' video (which is now towards the back of my bookshelf). I needed something low-impact, but very effective. This fit the bill.",1445817600,80,1416,4.637450199203188

3475008,4,B001AYWY6I,"Reading through these reviews I think the word ""beginner"" means something different to everyone. Here's what it means to me: I have not done Pilates before. I've tried yoga but it's too meditative for me. I'm not overweight but I am also not very flexible. I cannot touch my toes without bending my knees. I'm a runner looking to gain flexibility and strengthen my core. I'm using this DVD on days I don't run. I'm not sure how this DVD would really cause any significant weight loss but it will build muscle and that's definitely something. I love how I feel after it's over. I've never done Pilates and I have no trouble following along. If you can't lift yourself up with you abs, it's okay. Just do as much as you can...eventually you'll be able to. Some of the moves are a challenge but each move is short and there are a lot of stretches in between moves that feel awesome. I can't extend my leg the way Brooke does...yet...but I like how good my muscles feel when I'm done so I'm going to keep it up. I'll be touching my toes without bending my knees before long!",1439942400,20,1070,4.381909547738694

3475020,4,B001AYWY6I,This video is very good for beginners. I had never taken a Pilates class nor done a video of it before.

Note: For those who are out of shape and new to Pilates, trying this workout for the first time may be discouraging, since those with less-than-stellar abs won't be able to fully do all the moves. This is *NOT* only for skinny people. Just do what you can. You'll improve. I've already - along with a sensible diet - gone from a size 14 to a size 8 in the three months since I started it. And sure, you can say it's just the diet...but in the past, losing the amount of weight I have never got me down to a waist this small.

3475082,2,B001AYWY6I,"No matter how much I read the reviews before selecting this one I was still disappointed.  There are a few positives here - just at the bottom.  I have had to significantly modify how I exercise because I herniated T-9 - mid back, unlike most folks who do it near the neck or at base of back.  I simply cannot do downward dog - yes, despite calling it something else there are quite a few of those moves not to mention ""rolling"" on one's tail bone in 2 different of the matt exercises.  I realize I'll never find the perfect DvD, knowing I'll have to modify any sit ups and a couple other traditional moves (no problem) to the way I need to do them as well as do additional exercises for different back muscles no matter what ""work out"" kind of day it is.  I had a couple of yoga dvd's that I don't have to modify as much, but found them jumping from entirely too basic to those downward dog moves, but at least I could pick out a lot of the balancing moves that I found very helpful.  I would not call this DVD ""for beginners"" because there are some moves that even when I was my ""fittest"" long before I hurt my back I was not able to do even with being quite flexible and exercising consistently over many years.  I guess if you're comfortable on your tail bone in a full ""V"" position"" and twisting around your ankles to do a ""tail"" bounce this is the DVD for you.  I figure if I can't do most moves I should be able to modify them enough with the experiences I've had and this is not the case here.  Even more disappointing - I waited until I could do the entire Dvd exercise routine to write my review and now find it's $3 less than I paid for it.  Should have waited!  I hope this review will help the next person.  I purchased 1 other & will do that one shortly.  I'm not saying that this is just for young folks (I'm only in early 50's!) but you had better be more than a beginner in my opinion.  At least I'll be able to replace to the musical beat by do some of my regular routine back exercises & I'd say that'd be about 1/2 of the matt routine.  While I appreciate the full explanation about core and Pilates, the music is pleasant enough and she is straight forward and describes well.  It is laid out nicely with 2 different routines to mix/match with option to do both without dealing with controller, nice.  I noticed the DVD was 51 minutes, did not notice how long each section was but my perception it's probably about 20 minutes each.",1430179200,,2452,4.182978723404255

I taught Pilates classes for years and feel like this workout is more designed for intermediate levels.  I like the background setting and the music.  The cues are overlaid onto the soundtrack so the instructor is not cueing while she is doing the moves.  This is fine as the cues are well placed during the workout.  This workout has 2 parts - the first is labeled cardio but is not a cardio workout.  It starts with a good warm-up and includes some split lunges and modified push-ups.  The second part is the floor workout - traditional Pilates moves like roll-ups and saw.  A good mix of strength and stretch in true Joseph Pilates style.  A good, well-rounded workout.",1418256000,,850,4.714285714285714

Takes time to learn the moves and the order, so I did end up watching more than doing at the beginninging. Getting the hang of it now and am able to keep up (not able to actually do all the moves yet, but improving!!) most of the time.  I have severe vertigo and exercise, beyond walking with a walking stick, is super challenging.

3475240,1,B001AYWY6I,"the most boring workout ever, ever and I am a proponent of Pilates; it can be one of the most effective workouts and easy on the body when properly presented. She may or may not know her stuff, I'll never know, because she cannot present the workout in a comprehensive manner - a teacher, for all her boasting, she is not. Siler claims that this video is for beginners and if that is the case she proceeds much too quickly for newbies to keep up with, much less figure out what she's even doing! Because I'd paid for it I made a serious attempt to make it work for me [no go!] I hated it, put it away for a while and after deciding that there was no one I would even want to ""dump"" it on, I trashed it. I love The Martial Arts, Dance, Hiking, but still couldn't grasp or enjoy her ""whatever it is"".

I would definitely recommend as a stretching, strengthening and stress reducing program for anyone wanting to work-out using a video, and is especially geared for beginners. I figure I'm still a beginner since I forget to use it about nine months out of the year. Brooke is easy to understand and follow, and the scenery and music are quite pleasant additions.

She gives you clear, step by step instructions. Pilates isn't effective unless you are doing it with the proper technique. I feel that I get a much better workout because of her precise instructions. I would recommend that you also purchase Women's Health Big Book of Pilates because Brooke Siler wrote it and it contains more advanced moves when you are ready to move on from the DVD. I would not say that this is a good DVD for beginners to exercise, though. I was in fairly good shape to begin with and some of the moves were difficult. I am not a very flexible person, but I modified some parts of it and can now do most of the video with ease.

This one offers some moves I had not yet seen before and they are challenging.  A beginner to exercise will have some trouble keeping up but just go at your own pace and take breaks.  I like a video to be somewhat of a challenge otherwise how am I to grow stronger and improve.  It is roughly 40 minutes...and I like how she states which muscle group you are working in each exercise.  She does remind you to breath often telling you when to exhale.  So, her instruction is good.  Some have said it was too fast but I call it a deliberate pace and I much prefer it over a snore pace like another beginner dvd I bought.  This is a good total body workout but I still added in additional arm work.  And, I was sore the day after doing this dvd.  The goal!  Not as tiring or cardio as a bootybarre dvd but great to alternate with...but this is not on my ""easy day"" list.",1403136000,4,986,4.131578947368421

I bought this based on reviews and yep, it's what I had in mind. I took me 3 times to be able to do all the moves without stopping, so I know I'm getting stronger. I like that it's actual pilates and not some easy wimpy version. The instruction is excellent and you really do have chance to work on form rather than speed. If you're a real beginner, just do what you can, rest, and wait for Brooke to start the next move before joining back in.

I have always wanted to try Pilates, so I figured a beginner DVD was my best place to start.  The instructed is great.  She is not annoying and very gives great step by step instructions to follow her.  The setting is peaceful.  You can play the whole workout, which I think is about 55 minutes long.  On the main menu you have the option to play the first part of the workout, about 25 minutes, and the second half.  This is very nice, as I have four children and rarely have the time, with a newborn, to give myself uninterrupted time of almost an hour.  I have been doing the first workout almost daily, since I've had it.  It is a great wake up, energizing stretch and workout.  And right now, that is about all I can handle.  I have tried the second half twice and it is very difficult for me.  I look forward to someday completing the entire DVD.

3475350,4,B001AYWY6I,"Good beginners Pilates workout.  She explains how to do each pose as well as benefits in a voice over format.  Was easy to follow, not so easy to do.  There were some moves that had me feeling like a turtle stuck on it's back.  There were a few moves that will definitely take some time and practice to master!  I did both workouts on this DVD together.  Second one is def. the more challenging of the two.  I am new to Pilates and found the first workout easier to do.  Many moves were similar to what I've done in a yoga class which helped tremendously.  The second workout introduced some floor exercises that had you rolling and working that my 45 year old body had trouble doing, hence the turtle comment.  I was sore in places that my yoga class had never made sore the next day.  So I know I did work hard, it's just going to take me a while to master those floor moves.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is trying to increase overall core strength.  If you are just starting out this could be a very challenging workout.  Stick with it and it's does get easier to do.  I liked it because it is so different from your usual aerobic or strength video.",1400544000,14,1165,4.2318181818181815

The stretching took forever and I felt like I was doing the same stretch over and over. Then I felt the same way about the actual workout.

My wife will be 64 next month and is in good shape. She attributes that to the consistent Pilates mat exercises that she has done since 2005. The nice part about this workout is that it includes a non-jarring aerobic portion in addition to the stretching exercises.

3475376,5,B001AYWY6I,"I really enjoy this DVD and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try Pilates for the first time. The instructor walks you through each step of each move, instructs you on what you are trying to keep in mind and it really works! I felt so sore after this work out, but in the best kind of way! I would recommend this for everyone - beginners to experienced. I also enjoy the length of this workout. The instructor gets down to business and just keeps you plowing through each segment of the workout. The background is peaceful while you are at home sweating it out. Good price on this dvd, fast shipping, and no issues with the whole order process.",1395014400,3,652,4.352459016393443

There is a lot of explanation for each movement, so that helped me. I did not find it as challenging as I had hoped, though. I did the full time and was not sore the next day (or day after). Maybe as I learn the moves better, I can challenge myself--but I don't know. That said, I will put it in my rotation because the stretching is good and it is something different. It's totally low impact for those who need or want that.",1394582400,3,555,4.054545454545455
3475389,5,B001AYWY6I,"Being a lifelong runner, I needed some stretching so I thought Pilates might work.  I love this workout.  I don't find it hard, though I certainly can't stretch like Brook Siler, who is lovely and has such a peaceful way about her that it's like meditating when she speaks.

I like to do that 20(I think) section when I have time.  I don't often have the time for the whole thing, but I have to say that the time does fly when I'm doing this video.

The video portion is like a feast for the eyes.  Brooke has the kind of body(2 kids btw) that I want, and she seems nice, which is important because though I don't know her, I am inviting her into my home and spending time with her.  The set overlooks the ocean which is wonderful, and Brooke's instructions are clear and very easy to follow. I've tried some Yoga videos, but they went too slow, this workout is just the right speed and flows together nicely.

I can't say whether it works or not yet, because I've just started, but I can say that I was pretty sore the next day.  I love how long and lean it makes me feel afterwards, and it never feels like a burden to start the video up and start the workout.  I'm going to look into more of Brooke's videos for a more varied workout.  I never thought I'd like Pilaties, but it's a great workout.",1394409600,5,1299,4.19758064516129

3475391,2,B001AYWY6I,"If the routines in this DVD are aimed at people who perform in the circus or are perhaps yoga instructors, then maybe ""beginner"" is the correct term. For me--an overweight middle-aged person who'd heard that Pilates could really do wonderful things over time--Brooke Siler lost me at the part where you're supposed to lean down without bending your knees, put your hands on the mat, walk forward on your hands until you're in a plank, and then do a push-up.

Haven't touched the mat without bending knees since before baby #1, who is now driving.

Disappointing. I really hoped that this would be a good companion to the ""Yoga for Inflexible People"" by Maggie Rhoades, which really DOES treat us not-all-that-fit-but-wanting-to-be people more gently.

I can't believe that this is aimed at people who need to lose weight. Did the instructor actually consult anyone to find out what would be appropriate starting points for folks who are out of shape in the first place?

Pretty de-motivating. Look elsewhere, or don't start doing this until you already have some flexibility and strength.",1394236800,11,1088,4.994475138121547

The first time I played the DVD I did the second half (mat work) and was a bit sore afterwards. I have then continued to do the full DVD on most days and then only the amt work on days when I bike ride or walk. The pace of the exercises is very good for a beginner and Brooke makes it such an enjoyable routine that you look forward to playing the DVD each day.

After 10 days of pilates I can certainly feel the difference in my body (more toned in stomach, thighs etc). I would highly recommend this DVD for someone who has never done any Pilates before as you can see the results within a few days.",1390176000,,712,4.049645390070922

I've had a LOT of injuries the past few years, mostly blows to my ribs (car accident, bike accident, walking accident x2)..  so, needless to say in between chiropractic appointments and physical therapy I was still in a lot of pain. I've been doing this video for a week now and can really tell a difference in how my core is stronger and my back/neck aren't cracking with every move I make. I feel like it's helping put me back together! Wahoo!!

Also, I'd read other reviews who said that this video isn't for beginners. Being that I've never done Pilates before, I can't comment on that but I'm 30, 5'7 and 160 lbs and I have only had to stop a couple of times. There's a lot to remember when doing the exercises, such as breathing routines, muscle groups to hold in, making sure your posture is correct. I personally like that it's challenging, because if I'd been able to perfect it within the first few times doing the video I would be bored.",1382572800,5,1072,4.297029702970297

3475484,3,B001AYWY6I,"If you're older, overweight, and not all that flexible, the first set of weight loss Pilates on this DVD is not for you. It might be just fine for young people, but older people with the courage to try some of the moves could really get hurt. I'm not so sure overweight people could do it either, which in my opinion, misses the mark as to its supposed target audience.

I purchased the Element DVD thinking I could alternate the exercises with the Winsor Pilates Sculpting Circle DVD, which I also purchased from Amazon. The Winsor beginners circle is a straight beginner workout that's difficult for people who are out of shape at the start, but the effects are immediate, and it gets easier each day.

On the other hand, this DVD left me feeling discouraged after trying the first weight loss set. That said, the second part, the mat work, is a good workout, and the best place to start in my opinion. It may not be pretty if you're out of shape and have never done Pilates, but it will get easier as time goes on.

I gave this DVD three stars because I felt part of it was not suitable for overweight beginners. Perhaps after several more weeks of Pilates and Yoga, I'll be able to do some of it at least. To me, this indicates it's not purely a beginner Pilates workout. I'm guessing that the people who complain that it was too easy no doubt have already exercised, and are in far better shape than many beginners, who really need to lose weight.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Pilates-Weight-Loss-for-Beginners/dp/B001AYWY6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Pilates Weight Loss for Beginners</a>",1377043200,4,1657,4.996376811594203

The instructor is in great shape and offers a lot of moves and with great descriptions on how to do them. But I tried the cardio and was sore for three days (the squats, push ups, and elephant press got me). I tried the mat routine and have never completed it because it is too long. It is easier but is around 30 minutes long. I noticed little change with my physical situation and just decided to hit the treadmill again. This dvd is not for me.",1369353600,2,605,4.410714285714286

This is not an exercise video for weight loss, AT ALL!  It was ok for stretching but NOTHING challenging about it.  Maybe if you haven't exercised in years???  I would start an exercise and then she was moving on to another one before I even got anything out of it.  In addition, the narration was bad and it was B-O-R-I-N-G!!  What a waste of my time and money.  Never have I given a video away after trying it once but this is in my donate to Goodwill Pile, not even worth looking at it again.

From prior reviews, I expected more instruction since it states ""for Beginners"" but it was lacking. The exercises are quick moving & transitions not smooth thus aggravating my back & neck. At a recent retreat, a renown instructor said Pilates would be good for me which I followed with private lessons. Both my retreat experience and private lessons were very basic & easy to do. This DVD was a huge jump from my other two PIlates experiences. If you're experienced/more advanced in Pilates, this would be a decent home workout for you.",1367107200,7,633,4.925233644859813
3475515,5,B001AYWY6I,"I used to go to the gym and do basic cardio workouts with some weights. But after being pregnant and having my second baby, I haven't worked out seriously in about 10 months. It's a little difficult to get to the gym, so I tried this. I feel everything is explained well as you are going along. After the first few workouts I was definitely sore and sweaty. Now that I have done more, I am still getting sweaty but also getting a much better idea of exactly what I am doing and how to do it so the moves are most effective. I really like this video as a beginner. The moves are a little difficult because unless you are in good shape, you aren't used to using the muscles the way Pilates teaches.. so it does take a little way to really get the moves. But once you really start to strengthen your muscles, it does get easier.",1367020800,7,825,4.1625

I look pretty fit from lifting, running, and various ab exercises, but my chiropractor told me that I've training the ""wrong"" muscles, and I needed to strengthen my core.
The exercise does make you sweat because it gives you no time to rest! The moves range from relatively easy, challenging, to flat-out impossible for beginners...especially rolling all the way up to a seated position! I wish she provided more modifications so I won't have to skip these parts.
Lastly, this might be my personal preference, but I felt like she talked too much (non-stop throughout the workout). While it is nice to get clear instructions, I found it distracting, making it difficult for me to focus on my form.",1366588800,,800,4.7214285714285715

3475518,5,B001AYWY6I,"I've been using this video for months. Brooke is a great instructor teaching you the principles of Pilates and coaching you through each exercise. I'd recommend buying this in conjunction with her book ""The Pilates Body"" for further details on each exercise and to help you go through each exercise in your own fitness level. Yes, there are levels in this DVD.

The cardio section is great for anyone, but it's not supposed to get your heart rate up very high; I'd describe it as cardio with the classic Pilates approach of ""pain is bad."" You probably won't get a burn from the cardio section, but it's great for stretches and toning while getting your heart rate up slightly.

The matwork routine is really a combination of beginner exercises up through a couple advanced ones. You won't be able to keep up with her until you've learned how to do the exercises, so that's why you should buy the book. I'd recommend that you only do as many exercises that you can do correctly and without it hurting (which are instructions in her book). As you master each exercise according to all her instructions (if they're too easy in the beginning, you're probably not doing them right), and then add one exercise at a time. Like I said, I've been using this DVD for months and I haven't gotten past the 20 minutes mark of the 30 minute routine.

Pilates in general is supposed to be ""no pain IS gain."" The more you concentrate on each exercise, the more you'll get out of each exercise. The routines you begin with won't be that long (maybe 10 minutes), but you'll soon feel your muscles loosening and lengthening while you have more energy to get through the busy days. What I love about Pilates is that even those with muscle pain can do the exercises. I've had neck pain for years due to stooping over desks and computers. With Pilates strengthening my ab muscles, the knots in my back and neck are slowly going away. I've had to do modifications (i.e. not lift my neck so much) to avoid further injury, but it's paying off.",1366243200,7,2018,4.553719008264463

If you are just starting out, you can choose what you are able to start with and work up from there.  She is a great instructor from the PURE Pilates school of training and explains throughout how to do the movements properly.  I started seeing results after just two weeks.  I'm about 6 1/2 weeks in now and people are constantly complimenting me.  My physician noted my healthy weight during my physical and I referred her to this video.  Two more of my friends have already ordered it based on my results.  I used to be a runner and struggled with not being able to run anymore after ankle problems and stress fractures in my leg.  This is a great work out and I even feel myself using the basic principles to improve my posture throughout the day.  Improved posture alone takes away many common aches and pains.

I didn't realize that I had purchased yet another Elements DVD, and I will be more careful NEXT TIME.  If you need any sort of modification, she barely addresses this.  I think ELEMENTS has gotten truly CONFUSED about the word _BEGINNERS_ - both on their beginning yoga DVD and most certainly on this one.  If you are wanting to tone up using pilates and have anything like fibromyalgia - or are just wanting to START a program to tone up in the privacy of your home- I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE.

I have done Pilates in the past and I've even done this DVD workout before but this time being overweight prevented me from doing many of the exercises - I simply couldn't get my body into some of the poses.  Ms. Siler gives an easy-to-follow demonstration of the exercises and her voice cues are very easy to follow while doing the routine.  Once I lose more of this weight I'll try this DVD again.

3475564,3,B001AYWY6I,"The instructor voice-overs the program, which she performs on a mat on a platform near the ocean.
The pros:
The nature scenery doesn't distract the viewer because of the distance from ocean and no nature sounds are heard.
The instructor is business-teacher like in that she gives firm, confident instructions very concisely and continuously.
The instructor seems to be very competent.
The cons:
This is very brief and doesn't include much at all.  There should at least be the first basic ten.  This doesn't include the roll over nor open leg rocker.  Nor does it include lovely and easy mermaid.  What it does include is:  warm up fundamentals, the hundred (modified with legs up), roll up, leg circles, hot potato, rolling like a ball, seal, single leg stretch, corkscrew, single leg kick, saw, push up.

It is inexpensive and she's a good instructor, but this is really lacking, even for a beginners.  What I was trying to do was to replicate my mat Pilates class (that I cannot attend due to schedule conflict) with Mary Gordon.  She actually has a DVD on Amazon called Plus Size Pilates.  She does a great job of accommodating for plus size participants; there were several plus size women in our class and after a class or two with her, they could do everything and do it with strength and grace.
I should have purchased her DVD, but the $8 for this one vs the $20 for her award winning video lead me once again to the realization that a bargain is only a bargain if you are happy with what you get.  (Btw - She Mary teaches at Pima in Tucson, and she is a hoot in addition to teaching a great class.) Guess I will go buy it afterall :)",1340582400,3,1642,4.498316498316498

 The video has a great setting (as do all of the 'elements' videos). It overlooks the ocean and is just serene. Turn down the lights and light a candle and you could be at a spa. The workout is great for your abs and legs, especially. You'll definitely feel it the next morning, but the workout is easy to follow and enjoyable. After just a few uses, I can already feel myself becoming more flexible. I love this video and it pairs well with the 'ballet conditioning' video from Elements (although that ones a little more difficult).
 It's a great combination of strength, flexibility, and agility.",1337904000,,883,4.547169811320755
3475589,3,B001AYWY6I,"I've had Brooke Siler's ""Pilates Body"" for about a year now (but I've been practising for much less than that because of an injury), and I would say that this DVD is a convenient complement to her book, allowing me to be certain that I've been doing the exercises properly. Nevertheless, if you do possess the book and unless you've just bought it, the DVD will seem simple to you, because (and it is perfectly normal, being addressed to beginners) it shows the beginner's modifications only. Furthermore, there are no exercises for the arms, and  very few exercices for the legs, the side kicks series being much more developed in the book. The DVD is much more about abs work. And I think it may seem less challenging for a beginner to start with the book instead of the DVD, because you can have your own rhythm and are thus less likely to rush through the exercises without having time to check your position, which in my opinion is the danger of the DVD (and less likely to get neck pains from having to find a way to keep an eye on the TV as well). This being said, I liked the first section -the standing ""cardio"" section- very much, it is refreshing and I find it very efficient to stretch your body. It may prove hard if you're not very flexible though...",1335744000,,1264,4.424892703862661

She brings the same calm voice and ability to anticipate form corrections that she has on the CDs. This is a challenging workout for beginners and still useful for intermediate.

I love this DVD because after only 10 mins doing a low impact ""work out"", I began to feel my heart pounding and started sweating. I didn't think that'd be possible without doing the run of the mill (no pun intended) cardio work out. She doesn't make you do a million reps of the same thing either, and the moves flow together perfectly. She's a very straight forward instructor and it's slow enough to ""catch up"" when she's teaching you different moves, but fast enough where there's no ""breaks"" in between.

3475592,5,B001AYWY6I,This dvd is my first experience of pilates and I love it! I have done yoga for a few years and found it very easy to move to pilates because of the similarities of the poses in the two practices. The instructions are clear and well explained by the host and you can definitely feel the muscles you have been neglecting the next day. The exercises flow very well into each other at a pace that is not too fast but enough to get your heart rate up. Putting this dvd into practice with a forty minute walk every other day has started to change my body shape already after about 4 weeks. It's not a magic solution to weight loss because you have to put in the work but it's fast pace and limited repetitions make it a great change from other exercise videos.,1332892800,,754,4.206896551724138

It may take several weeks or months to follow the complete program and feel comfortable doing it ... but it is worth the effort!

The scenery is also quite lovely (if you have time to look at it between roll-ups), and even the music was nice. I hope they make more like this one in the future.",1331510400,,453,4.536585365853658

My fitness level is about a 4/10.  The first time I did this workout, I could barely make it through part 1.  A few days later, I could not do part 2 entirely.  I like that I have something to work towards with this dvd.  They give you several modifications for most of the exercises, to make it easier or harder.

I like how the host does not talk while she is working out, but her voice is recorded.  The audio I would rate 10/10, and the video 9/10.  It shows up nicely on our hdtv.

Each move feels different when you press your feet down, when you tighten your thighs, etc. I've been doing it about 4 times a week and my waist has gone down two inches and my clothes fit a lot better. I did winsor pilates before and it worked well but I feel like this one surpasses it. they both have similar moves but I feel like they're better explained in this workout. Do give it a try!

3475611,4,B001AYWY6I,"This DVD may say it's for beginners, but it is one challenging workout! My cousin introduced me to Pilates a couple years ago, and I loved the way the exercises worked my core without stressing my joints. I have since purchased two books and three DVDs. I am so glad that I started with the books because I could study the illustrations and learn the exercises at my own pace. If I hadn't, I would have been lost trying to follow along with this DVD. The instructor definitely gives you an aerobics workout, but if you haven't seen or practiced the exercises before, you'll probably find that you can't keep up. I could barely keep up, and I knew most of them. With Pilates, your body alignment is critical so you shouldn't be turning your head constantly to see exactly what the instructor is doing. If you choose this as your very first introduction to Pilates, I recommend watching the DVD all the way through so that you know basically what the exercises are before attempting them yourself. And if you haven't been involved with an exercise program before, I absolutely wouldn't start here. The instructor may call the moves basic, but they are challenging. I've done the workout a dozen times or more and I still can't do some of the stretches and exercises the way the instructor performs them. Chances are, I never will. Although I've tried to be physically fit by doing aerobics, treadmill, dancing, weight training etc. for more than 30 years, my guess is that there are some exercises in this DVD I will never be able to do. I am not built like an athlete and have suffered injuries in the past that make some of the stretches and positions unlikely. As some other reviewers have said, it would have been nice if this instructor had offered modified versions so that if you can't complete a given exercise as shown, you would know how to correctly do an easier version. All in all, if you're looking for a challenging Pilates weight loss DVD, this one should give you a fabulous body if you stay with it, but go into it thinking it will be a challenge and not an easy, relaxed introduction to Pilates.",1327017600,3,2112,4.560526315789474
3475612,4,B001AYWY6I,"This DVD is the first by Brooke Siler, one of the ""second generation"" Pilates instructors (i.e., she was taught by Romana Kryzanowska, an instructor who learned directly from Joseph Pilates himself).  Siler is featured alone in the same ocean-side garden setting used for the other Element workout DVDs (for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Stress-Relief-Flexibility/dp/B00429C1W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility</a>), and she instructs via voiceover.

The Main Menu offers the following options:
*Play Pilates-Conscious Cardio
*Play Pilates Prep & Matwork Section
*Play Complete Program

The first segment, Pilates-Conscious Cardio (18.5 minutes), is perhaps better described as an extended warm-up stretch.  Siler begins standing with a review of Pilates breathing and then moves into shoulder rolls, one-arm circles, side stretch, windmills, standing twist, standing saw, and standing swing.  She also does what she calls a ""squat series,"" actually a series of plies adding in a windmill and a twist.  This is followed by a set of lunges plus a lunging hip flexor/hamstring stretch.  Siler concludes with a brief set of push-ups (on knees), star (side plank variation), and finally, swan prep.

The Pilates Prep & Matwork Section is 29 minutes long.  Here Siler begins with half roll back and pelvic lifts to prep for a partial roll up.  She then moves into what she describes as a beginner's matwork series.  This includes the hundred, full roll-up, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, series of five, spine stretch forward, hip circles, saw, heel kicks, side kick series (up/down, circles, hot potato), teaser prep, one-leg teaser, seal, and full push-ups.

Siler performs all of the exercises in a flow, moving almost seamlessly from one to the next.  Although she provides excellent information on form, those who are brand-new to Pilates may find that this video does not provide quite enough instruction.  (In this case, I would suggest Siler's first book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pilates-Body-The-Ultimate-At-Home-Guide-to-Strengthening-Lengthening-and-Toning-Your-Body-Without-Machines/dp/076790396X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pilates Body: The Ultimate At-Home Guide to Strengthening, Lengthening, and Toning Your Body--Without Machines</a>, as an excellent accompaniment; Ana Caban's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Beginning-Mat-Workout/dp/B00005M1XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates - Beginning Mat Workout</a>&nbsp;is also a great choice.)  However, this DVD might be more ideally suited to those who are experienced exercises yet new to the practice of Pilates.

Personally, although I have been practicing Pilates on and off for over ten years and consider myself to be at a more intermediate level, I appreciated the pace of this program, and I found Siler's instruction to be an excellent refresher.",1326585600,16,3045,6.518610421836228

3475614,4,B001AYWY6I,"I have a background as a dance/aerobics teacher.  I have been dancing for 20+ years and taught aerobics for 6 years.  I was asked to start teaching elementary pilates at a fitness studio and I bought this dvd to introduce me to the world of pilates.

This dvd is a challenge for beginners.  I can see people giving up because they can't finish it.  The first time I did this dvd, my legs were shaking so bad at the end.  But it does get easier with practice and patience.

Pros:  the moves and transitions are very smooth and flowing throughout the dvd.  The instructor goes through all the moves and her voice is recorded over the movements so she is not talking and demonstrating the moves at the same time.  I really like that way of doing it.

The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is because some of the moves are very awkward as far as timing goes.  I prefer precision moves and I realize that she has to do the first set of moves slower to demonstrate and be able to talk it through but her timing was very awkward in some spots.  She would do the right side slow and then all of the sudden the left side would zip through.  Perhaps because I am a dance instructor who lives on timing and precision, maybe I noticed it more.

I would recommend this as a beginner's dvd but with the realization that you will not get it all at once.  It takes time.  I have been doing this for several weeks and the last 3 minutes of the dvd I still cannot do.  I don't even attempt it at this stage, I turn it off when I get to the last 2 sets of roll ups, they are way too challenging.  But it is something I am aiming for.",1325894400,5,1621,4.072784810126582

3475616,4,B001AYWY6I,"I've recently been dieting and along with that I started this pilates video. I feel much more in shape, especially my abs which I have always had trouble figuring out how to trim that area down more. I love this dvd and I feel great each time I do it, but my sister has done years in pilates and she noticed that some of the moves on this video are a little to advanced for beginners. For example, when you do leg circles, she says they started out by doing small leg circle to trace the ceiling then worked their way up. Also on the roll up, they move you right along into a full roll up rather than starting smaller.
This is the main reason I rated this a 4 star, but I still love the dvd and work on it continuously. So far, I'm taking baby steps through it all and when I go to work out with it I never finish the whole dvd. I wait till I notice that I'm actually working my muscles on each move rather than go through the motion of it. I started working out with this is July and so far, it being the end of November, I'm only at the leg circles on the second part and I stop after that. I also only work out every other day, so I'm just building my body up slowly and making sure that I feel my muscles work through each and every move.
My advise is to do the same if your a first-time beginners in this. I helps lengthen the time you can use the dvd, because once I've reached the point where I'm completing the dvd and I have all the moves down then I'll have to go to the next level on another dvd. Also, by taking it slower, it helps you really work through the moves rather than, as I said, go through the motion and not really work the muscles the way you should.
I hope this helps some people!",1322352000,10,1706,3.9766763848396502

I work full-time and I'm standing five to six hours a day, so this workout really helps loosen my tight muscles.

I bought it maybe two years ago, and hadn't really given it a shot - but a few weeks ago, it hit me that rather than trying to run outside in the heat or pay a ton to go to a gym that's far away, I would instead give this old workout video a shot. Well, I LOVE IT. I've never ever done workout videos at home with any regularity, until now. I love how calm and realistic Brooke Siler is: the video is of her, not talking, doing the poses; and her voice is added overtop separately. Her movements are clear and simple, the directions are great, and doing it repeatedly, I have already seen my body improving and my endurance as well. Split into two twenty-minute workouts, it's EASY to take maybe 25 minutes out of your day to lay out a yoga mat and get your tv (or in my case, laptop) set up to work out. No extra time required to travel to the gym or anything, and you can always do both workouts if you want more out of it. I can't recommend this highly enough. Thanks to this video, I think I'll be a big Pilates fan for a long time. It's better than any Pilates class I've taken in a gym. Hope you'll give it a try and enjoy it as much as I do. After I workout with it, I find that the whole rest of the day I'm intentionally sitting better, and having better posture. I feel great, and it completely makes my day.

To summarize, it's really well done workout set: complete with a peaceful atmosphere, challenging workouts with directed ability to adapt to your strengths/weaknesses, and it will save you lots of time/money from not having to travel to and from a gym or pay for that! I will keep this DVD workout video for a long, long, time. Though I hope someday I might dare to move up from ""Beginners"". Oh and if you aren't concerned about weightloss?

3475636,5,B001AYWY6I,This is only the 2nd Pilates video I've tried & it's already my favorite! It REALLY kicked my butt on the 1st workout! I had to take a day off to recover! I never knew I even owned some of the muscles I worked out with this video. Especially in the...ahem....gluteal area. Ha! I really got to sweating with this video & I just know it'll get easier as I go. For now this is just what I need to work my way into Pilates!,1304985600,4,419,3.9411764705882355
3475637,5,B001AYWY6I,"I've tried a few Pilates DVD's over the years, and just could never get into it. I'm such a fan of some of the other DVD's from Element though that I decided to give this a try. I am very glad I did because I've found that with the right instructor I really like Pilates.

This DVD is broken up into 2 parts: ""pilates concious cardio"" (20min), and ""pilates prep & mat work"" (30min). It should be noted that the ""cardio"" section is not really cardio. Though your heart rate will elevate somewhat it's not to a level that I would call ""cardio"". Despite that I love the exercises involved in this section, which range from very easy to very physically demanding (especially the last 5 minutes or so). The mat work section focuses mostly on your abdominal muscles, but there's also some leg/hip exercises. Again, it ranges from easy to physically demanding.

As an instructor Brooke Siler is excellent. No faux encouragement, and she uses imagery to help you perfect your form, which I found extremely helpful. Though this is supposed to be a ""weight loss"" workout I don't think Brooke even mentions that; at any rate she doesn't harp on about it, which is quite nice. You also will not need any special equipment, and only enough space in which to stretch out completely.

The reasons I love this DVD is because it uses controlled motion to build strength, which is excellent for me because I'm a total klutz. It's not glacially slow like some beginners Pilates DVD's are, but you are never left trying to frantically keep pace either. Secondly it pairs strengthening exercises with stretching, and even though I'm usually sweaty at the end of this workout I always feel great because of that combination. I must say in the few weeks I've been using this DVD my strength and flexibility have definitely increased. I do workout using other DVD's and being active by hiking, but since putting this in my rotation 3x a week I've noticed my arms are stronger, my pants are looser, my hips are slimming, and my abs are getting some definition.

While I do think this is an excellent beginners Pilates workout, I'm not sure if it would be a good workout for someone who isn't at least a little physically fit. If you were truly an out of shape beginner I would treat it with caution; maybe skip some of the harder exercises until you build up a little muscle strength and don't push your body beyond it's limits because you can hurt yourself. It's not such a hard workout though that's it's intimidating, but it definitely gives you a goal to work towards.",1303603200,192,2547,4.60352422907489

The first part is the Pilates-inspired cardio workout and is relatively easy, yet is still a nice well-rounded workout that breaks a sweat and gets the heart pounding a little. The second part, focusing on mat-work, is a very difficult (for me) gut-busting workout from hell, which perhaps someday I will be able to do, but certainly not now. However, even if I do just half of the mat-work (quitting halfway through the routine or holding the poses for just half as long), I still get an intensive and needed toning of my abs.",1301097600,12,605,4.509090909090909

Brooke Siler is amazing. The exercises are easy enough to follow but definitely smooth enough to keep you on your toes. (Sometimes literally.) Her confidant and effortless approach to each exercise allows for a great role model.

I've been doing the workout now consistently for over a month and I'm pretty close to being able to do most of them.

For those of you who are completely out of shape (much like I was when I started doing the routine), be warned that this is a challenging workout, and you will definitely feel the burn. It took me almost two months before I could do the whole thing from start to finish. For me personally, the results have been great. My favorite aspect of the workout is the ""active stretching"". These really help tone and lengthen your body. I find that my posture is improved, my joints more limber, and (the best part) my waistline is smaller! Even better, once you learn the routine, you can do the workout pretty much anywhere that you have a little bit of floor space. Highly recommended.

The standing exercises in the first segment provide a great workout and a nice change from traditional mat work. Not all Pilates workout videos are created equal.

If you are looking for a precision workout of pilates instruction this dvd may very well be perfect for you.  If you are just looking for a simple workout to increase heart rate and feel good afterwards that happens to be pilates though I would probably suggest trying some other options out there.",1274486400,8,682,4.475806451612903
3475670,3,B001AYWY6I,"I have taken Pilates classes on my own and decided to get a video, since I'm often bad about leaving the house to attend classes.  This is my first exercise video ever, so my critique may not take into account what's normally expected from other exercise videos.  I like this video a lot and I don't think the moves are complicated; in fact, they're pretty straightforward.  But after taking Pilates classes that catered to rank beginners, I found aspects of this video frustrating at times.

First of all, the speed is intense.  Sometimes, I forget to breathe trying to figure out the exercise -- Siler is either doing harder ones than I was taught or with some modifications.  In my classes, there was typically a 2-3 minute pause for breathing between exercises; something that not only made it easier, but helped me push through a 50-minute set.  This video has 45 minutes of exercise with little pause at all.  So there's more moves than I am used to, and it's done really fast with no breaks. I could hit pause on the remote, but who wants to deal with that after your 20th roll-up?

Also, index skips would have been a nice feature.  When I'm worn out doing roll-ups or their derivatives, I would like to move on to other types of floor work -- but I have to use a FFWD feature to get it done.  My Pilates instructor, before we took a break from the winter said that in order to do mere upkeep, you needed to do three types of exercise for each of the following sets:  the back series, the stomach series, the side series and standing.  This is to help you keep your body in balance.  Because there are no well-planned skips, it makes it challenging to try to balance your modified workout as you're trying to learn the series.

Nevertheless, the moves are simple, but some of them are intermediate or advanced forms,according to Brooke Siler's book on Pilates.  I plan to do as much as I can until it gets easier. I'm kind of okay with the fact that it's a little too hard for me; but I also have the experience of having had some classes to try to make sense of it.  Might be harder for someone just starting out.",1273795200,141,2122,4.413881748071979

Most of the DVD is a ""beginner"" Pilates workout. I was clearly going to end up frustrated and/or injured, so I stopped.

Have tryed this dvd twice and I had to grid my teeth every time I sat and my legs burned for weeks. I am going to do it agian today hoping It will not make as sore as before...I sure hope not.

The technique is explained perfectly and the exercises are challenging. I gave this four stars, however, because it is NOT a cardio workout as advertised. I am in pretty good shape (run/walk on the treadmill six days a week) and this workout did not even make me break a sweat. However, for Pilates, it is wonderful. What I have done now is do a 30 minute jog on the treadmill first and then do the Pilates matwork portion of this video.

3475726,5,B001AYWY6I,"I love this DVD for several reasons. First, there are very few pauses in the narration. The constant instruction makes for a truly thorough understanding of the movement, what it should feel like, and what it should look like. This is exceptionally important when embarking on any kind of home workout, since there are no instructors to say when one is doing something wrong. Brooke Siler herself is likeable, not irritatingly energetic and yet she shows enough enthusiasm to keep from being boring.

The workout itself is paced very well. It moves quickly enough that it keeps the heart rate elevated without sacrificing the relaxing and energizing benefits that pilates has to offer. Beginners will be able to keep up without too much trouble but intermediate pilates students shouldn't write this off either. It's a challenge.

And it produces RESULTS. I wasn't overweight, but certainly could have used some toning. I squeezed this into my weekly routine here and there for a couple of months and I was wowed by the difference. Then I took it more seriously as a workout regime and changed a few eating habits, now I can't wait for beach season!",1239408000,7,1149,4.887179487179488

The instructor has a pleasant voice and her pace is slow enough for you to keep up but  not enough to bore you.  Even though the moves may seem simple, it takes a lot of effort do them CORRECTLY, and when you do them correctly, you feel the burn.  The DVD is a little under an hour, but her instruction makes it seem like went by a lot faster, which is a good thing, so you don't stare at the clock during your workout.",1238716800,5,589,4.043103448275862

Before that I'd attended classes here and there w. one teacher at my gym but didn't really ""get it"". Then I tried it w/ another teacher & it just clicked for me and it seriously changed my body and my life. B/c it's not always easy for me to get to the gym my teacher recommended I get some videos for home as well. I got Ana Caban's Imtermediate video by Gaiam at my teacher's recommendation but never got that into it. Then I received an invitation to attend a free class w/ Brooke Siler & it was wonderful(I met her afterwards as well and she's lovely). Anyway they gave us this video as a gift and I use it all the time, although I am no longer a ""beginner"", I like it so much better than the Ana Caban one. I'm saying all this b/c I have found w/ Pilates that it really makes a big difference who your teacher is, whether it's in person or a class. I would recommend this to beginners as well as people who have been doing it for awhile. I admit in some parts I do find myself a little bored(like practicing head lifts) but others like the hundreds are challenging I think for any level. So it has both. & if some parts are too difficult for you right away, you can work your way up to them. I am going to try some different videos but so far this is my favorite and I have been suggesting it to friends. I hope she comes out w/ another one soon!",1236816000,13,1438,4.049122807017544

The first chapter of the dvd includes some standing work that allows the body to open in lateral flexion, rotation and extension.  Additionally, you warm the body with some strength from planks/push-ups (Pilates style...all abs).  The matwork is a beginner/intermediate level and provides wonderful abdominal exercise. With proper attention to form, your body should respond with this one quickly, not to mention it is such an enjoyable form of movement.  If you are a beginner to Pilates, this is the dvd for you.

Brook's instructions are VERY clear and concise and she reminds you all the way through how to stay focused and how to do each stretch correctly which is so important.  This is my favorite by far.

This really took me back to a challenging mat class.  Clear, concise and helpful tips and guides all throughout at a pace that is not too slow nor too fast.  Brooke's body was also a very good visual aide - she was able to demonstrate the nuances of tucking your pelvis in, etc.  Really liked the cardio section in the beginning which when connected with the mat class really made it a fulfilling workout.

If Brooke's body is an example of what Pilates can do for you -especially after 2 babies -- then everyone should try her beginner Pilates dvd routines.

I did this one today and just loved it!  Don't worry that it says it's for beginners if you've been doing Pilates for years.  This is a solid Intermediate Pilates workout.

I'm  a middle aged woman who is about 30 pounds  overweight  and needs to lose  abdominal  fat. About this dvd:  I really like Brooke Siler, she is very likeable and she  does a voice over  in this dvd  which was nice.  It's just her doing the exercises which was better to me than having a group  of people .  It is a beach setting which felt very peaceful.  My own experience  with this pilates dvd: The pilates workout is very challenging, I tried to do all of the video  right at the start, every other day  and I know  I over did it not giving myself time to build up to it.  The more days I was doing the dvd the harder it was for me to get through it all as I was achy from the last time, and I felt sick to my stomach doing the exercises at times. You have to focus on your breathing, it takes time to learn how to do it right in Pilates.  I only stayed with the dvd workout  for two weeks, partly due to needing to give my body a break but also need the time to do the workout and I'm a busy mom of three.  I do hope to get back to it in the near future  at a more slower pace because  I have no doubt that if a person was to stick with  it that you would see results along with eating  a healthy diet.
