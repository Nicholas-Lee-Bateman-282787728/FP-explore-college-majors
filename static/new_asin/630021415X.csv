228241,3,630021415X,"This movie was based on the book of the same name by Pat Conroy, which also happens to be one of my favorite books.  Maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment by watching it, but I was still surprised by the large  scale hacking used to cut it down to a movie.  Somehow, they managed to  turn the wonderfully rich character of Will into a paper thin cutout of  honor and glory.  Where did his grey areas go?  Although it has an  interesting plot and as well (but not spectacularly) acted, I spent my time  wishing they could have done a better job of making this wonderful book  into a movie",954374400,2,598,4.258928571428571

A remarkable tale of what it is like to enter a military type school modeled after The Citadel where Pat Conroy, the author actually went to and graduated. A must see ofor parents wanting to have theri chold be given the discipline of a military college. The Freshmen hazing is violent and if true makes one wonder what the purpose to scare the hell out of ""knobs"" to make them stronger or just to survive the verbal and physical abuse. The camraderie of the 4 roomates leading to tragedy and the coming of age of the main character is well played. The mystery of the ""Ten"" who are an invisible group of cadets who will use drastic means to get a cadet they disapprove of e.g. the first negro cadet, a cadet who wets his pants under pressure, a heavy set knob who cries and cannot take the abuse.

228466,5,630021415X,I read the novel and greatly enjoyed the movie. It holds very true to the book by Pat Conroy who is a Citadel alumni. There are many very fine young actors in this movie who went on to strong careers who are still acting to this day. This movie is about a secret society at the Citadel and the abuse and prostitution of power. As we all learned in about the third grade 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'  Sadly there were once secret societies in some of our nations military universities. As I understand it they took root after the civil war. Essentially there were I'm very sad to write even at West Point at one time a southern racist society of students just like the '10' depicted in this movie. I have read in a biography of General Douglas MacArthur that at West Point southern cadets who had sway tried desperately to run him out of the pt because his father was a union medal of honor civil war hero. There were other racial bias crime attacks particularly against African American cadets who were the first African Americans to ever enter the point.,1399248000,,1064,4.512953367875648
228496,3,630021415X,"Pat Conroy's novels are so rich and his characters are so deep that it's hard to capture the essence of his stories in a two-hour movie. This one is another example of that. It isn't a bad movie, but it doesn't do justice to the novel.",1389139200,,235,4.130434782608695
228497,4,630021415X,"I thought the movie was very good.  It is based on Pat Conroy's personal experience at the The Citadel and the hazing, that wasn't just humiliating but a evolving into life and death.
David Keith was excellent in his role, and it think the film moved along well.  However, during the middle, the action slowed a bit.  Otherwise, it's a strong story of the old South versus the fight that the black man continued fighting in the sixties",1387065600,,435,4.551282051282051
228498,5,630021415X,"I think this movie is at the Top of my List.  Born and Raised near West Point Military Academy in West Point, NY, I seen a lot of Cadets coming in and graduating.

228540,4,630021415X,Overall it was a great movie and I really enjoyed it.  The one criticism I do have is the use of the Racist remarks. I realize that it was part of the original movie but I think it should've been changed when the movie was rereleased.  I also have to wonder about the accuracy of the movie because I can't understand why someone who is trying to help the black cadet would use the Racist remarks anyway just doesn't make sense to me at all.,1356825600,,440,4.1647058823529415

It was such a microcosm of the extensive tome, it should not have been made into a movie unless it was three hours. The film omitted the strong emotions that were in force at the Citadel, and it also left one to wonder why anyone would go there in the first place. Will's past and also his involvement with the pregnant girl were left out; these facts contributed to why Will was at the Citadel. Moreover, Pignetti's ""walk of shame"" ended with his simply getting into a cab. In the book, he kept on walking to the train tracks and [possible spoiler here so I will not write it]. tsk tsk...people should read the book.",1353715200,,769,4.273972602739726

228548,5,630021415X,The Lords of Discipline is a great classic movie.  Received the movie within a day or so of ordering; great transaction!,1276387200,,120,4.714285714285714
228549,4,630021415X,"When watching, as well as reviewing, ""The Lords Of Discipline"", it is best not to judge the film by its faithfulness to the book it is based on. Unlike ""Christine"", which was adapted to film brilliantly by John Carpenter, ""The Lords of Discipline"" was mercilessly cut and chopped to fit it into a movie that lasted less than five hours. There is no Colonel Edward T. Reynolds, Annie Kate Gervais, no freshman year flashbacks for Will, and the terrifying might of The Ten is largely lost. They are defeated far too easily in this movie, and the near-mythical image they and General Bentley ""Shipload"" Durrell have is not very well shown in the film. Again, it's best not to compare the movie and the book too much. Better to think of them as being two completely unrelated works that happen to share the same name and basic storyline. No, that doesn't really make sense either. But it does make more sense than ""Spacecataz"", surely. Anyway.

The acting in this film is top notch. Robert Prosky and G.D. Spradlin are brilliant as Colonel Thomas ""The Bear"" Berrineau and General Bentley ""Shipload"" Durrell, and while those were the ones who stood out most in my mind, all the other roles were well played.

The story is well done, for the most part, though the presence of cheese with a side of cliche is quite noticeable at times. The Bear asks Will McClean, a senior with no rank whatsoever, to watch out for the Carolina Military Institute's first black cadet as he passes through the freshman system. A secret organization on campus, The Ten, moves in on that cadet, Pearce, when the cadre fail to get rid of him themselves. That's where things get anticlimactic. The cadre confronting a knob on the A Company quad at the film start, and the tragic tale of Poteete, the human yam, are very well done, as are the scenes involving Hell Night. But the scene at General Durrell's plantation house? The Ten are supposed to be the best of each class, physically and mentally, and here Will, Mark and Pig just knock them down like bowling pins. Lame.... and there is no way to effectively describe how lousy the confrontation with Durrell and the closing scene are. Bah. But next to the unforgivably awful ""Children of the Corn"" films, this movie is a work of art. It has many flaws and much cheese with cliche on the side, but I can't call it a bad movie. Robert Prosky is simply too good as ""The Bear"", and also- ""The Lords of Discipline"" was filmed in England. Why? VMI, The Citadel, and any other military schools that the film makers asked about filming on campus were quite adamant in their refusal. Didn't like what it was about, too negative about life at a military school. But how did that go, one wonders? I honestly had no idea the movie was not actually filmed in the American South until I looked it up. They convince you of the film's being set in a 1960's South Carolina that well.

As I said, ""The Lords of Discipline"" is an imperfect film, and fans of the book it is based on- emphasis, 'based'- could start a riot over how unfaithful an adaptation this is. But as I have said, it's best not to think about that. This movie is actually pretty good. It's better than ""Children of the Corn"", and makes more sense than ""Spacecataz"". That's got to count for something.

Did I mention that David Keith plays McClean and Bill Paxton plays John Alexander? I have now, so be happy.",1268265600,,3385,4.553366174055829
228590,5,630021415X,"This is a really good movie.  The acting is uniformly top shelf.  A wonderful performance is turned in by Bill Paxton, and also by John Lavachielli.  Mr. Lavachielli has gone on to become an accomplished writer and story teller.  He also wrote and directed an exceptional feature film about being stuck in L.A. titled ""Wednesday Again"", that he acts in as well.  Mr. Lavachielli is an underground cult figure in L..A. and may very well become mainstream if the culture ever catches up with him.

228596,4,630021415X,"I guess you could say I was fortunate enough to see this movie before reading the book so I didn't have to make hard comparisons until later.  Yes, the book is much more detailed and interesting at certain points but it would be impossible to adapt it all into the movie.  Standing on its own, this film still delivers.

Will McClean is in his senior year at the Carolina Military Institute in 1964 in the Deep South.  For the first time in the institute's history, they're going to admit a black cadet and this at a time when racial issues are still readily evident.  Will is directed by his chain of command to protect this individual and track his progress.  What is not known right away is information about a secret society within the institute known as `The 10'.  This group recruits the best cadets from within the ranks but prey on the weak and unfortunate who they decide are not worthy of remaining in the institute.  And they use whatever methods they deem necessary to force out the undesirables.

As the year progresses, disturbing events begin to happen and Will learns new information about `The 10' regarding just how powerful and influential they are.  So much so that it may seriously jeopardize his relationship with his roommates and his career.  Forced to question his beliefs in an honorable military system and compelled to make the right decisions no matter the cost, he risks everything in a dramatic and exciting showdown with `The 10'.  This leads to a nice conclusion to the movie.

If you have or haven't read the book that this movie is based on, it's really not that bad in and of itself.  There are a few weak points now and again but the cast is good, the story holds together, and the acting is pretty solid.  Just don't go into watching this while comparing everything to the book because that'll be a let down.  I know because I watched it again after reading the book.  With that in mind, I recommend this movie to everyone.",1178841600,7,1961,4.573065902578796

A number of pupils were taken on as extras and spent most of the time getting wrecked...Which is why, in some of the ""hazing"" scenes, people cracking up laughing can be clearly seen. Sorry about that Mr Roddam, we couldn't help ourselves.

It was great to see how a film gets made, and a true highlight was going to a Clash gig in Brixton that summer with those ridiculous ""Jarhead"" haircuts . Another was receiving drill instruction from a USMC drill instructor whose expression of sheer contempt, when he saw the zonked rabble he had to work with, was quite something to behold.

After reading Mr. Conroy's masterpiece, I was overjoyed to see the movie at my local Blockbuster.  I excitedly took it home to show my wife in hopes that she would understand the brilliance that is Pat Conroy.  After watching it, I sat speechless while she asked ""what's the big deal?""  I had no answer, as I too felt that the movie was a few hours of my life that were sincerely wasted.

In taking a book of this quality and thoroughly ""hollywoodizing"" it, the movie makers have done a severe disservice.  The good looking leading man, the happy ending, etc.  The book was one that I'll remember until the day I die.  This movie is nothing more than an excuse to eat popcorn and relax for a few hours.

228634,3,630021415X,"Perhaps if The Lords of Discipline stood alone as a movie, I would hold it in higher regard. Sometimes books and movies work a symbiosis on each other. In this case, the mastery of the book immeasurably takes away from the movie.

Thank goodness for VHS/DVD formats - I don't remember the movie ever coming out ""in a theater near me"" - it seemed to have been quite forgettable in its day. It was likely compared back then (unfavorably) to ""Taps"" when ""Taps"" had the George C. Scott ""Patton"" connection, not to mention being the ""rookie card"" of an up and coming cast of young stars.

I enjoy watching it now simply because my son is about to graduate from El Cid and it is a reasonably good way for him to show his old high school friends what it is like. It is a pity it could not have been filmed ""on location"" at The Citadel to at least have preserved that archival angle.  Whereas the book seemed to capture the zeitgeist of the era, the movie comes across as ""dated"" a mere 20 years after its release. It just baffles me why Conroy's book is lauded (rightfully so) as a contemporary literary masterpiece and the movie is Plain Jane vanilla. I think it could have been directed in a more sophisticated manner - the final product just looked like it was made for late night TV viewing.

I have contemplated what a remake would be like, but it just wouldn't work, either. Race relations, out of wedlock pregnancy, all-male institutions - none of these seem to have the impact they once had. Perhaps it could be re-worked with the ""first female"" schtick, but that is probably just as dated now - less than a decade removed from the controversy . As others have commented, a TV serial probably would have been a more appropriate format. Better yet, just read the book - it is much more enjoyable.

BTW - on the art work on the original VHS, doesn't that look like Jean-Claude Van Damme? What is the deal with that? It is a bit like watching James Brolin playing the role of Pee-Wee Herman.",1101686400,4,1989,4.423497267759563
228635,5,630021415X,"This one is an old favorite of mine, which I pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available.  I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work.

This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called ""knobs"" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as ""The Ten"" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability.

David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.

I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.  This is a wonderful film.  It is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD.",1099785600,33,1423,4.490272373540856

228637,2,630021415X,"No movie under six hours could have captured anywhere near the complexity and subplots of Pat Conroy's novel about life in a military academy.  For that I was very forgiving about what what cut out, even painfully so.  We see no flashbacks of the main characters first three years, there was almost nothing about his passion for basketball, and the love story could have been a movie in itself.
But things had to go, and rather than treat them badly, I have no resentment for what they left out.  The movie does concentrate on some important things however, and for awhile, does it well.  We see the often cruel treatment upperclassmen give underclassmen, and can see the reasoning why this seems to be necessary.  It is the overriding theme of the book, and shows the givers and takers of the harrassment very well.
It also does tackle one of the important subplots, which is the treatment of the first black recruit to the academy.  The way the recruit was treated is shown in all of it's frightening detail.  David Keith, as the assigned mentor to the recruit, does his job perfectly here by not showing too much sympathy.
But then it all crashes down by trying to come up with a clean, Hollywood, more upbeat ending.  The worst sin is the handling of the Pignatello character to make it much less tragic. To leave out what happens after the court martial is to take away one of the dramatic points of the story.  With that said, the ending was also much too neat.  The way it is handled fails to illustrate the parallel love-hate relationship the main character has with the academy.
This was far too personal a story to be glossed over like this, and I wish Pat Conroy had had more pull to get it done right.  He should have chosen the Larry McMurtry route and got the story filmed as a mini-series.",1023148800,15,1804,4.52

A similar situation occurs with The Caine Mutiny as well as The Godfather. Written stories allow you to explore aspects of character and situation that just can't be effectively portrayed in film. In film, you can't have the character's thoughts effectively presented. The film concentrated on the relationship between Will and Pearce, while the book actually had two plots-Will and Pearce and Will and Annie Kate. Instead of comparing book and film, treat each as seperate entities and enjoy them independently. In this case, the movie was enjoyable.",998956800,11,693,4.982758620689655

I knew not to expect the movie to be quite as good as the book, but I sincerely feel that I wasted my time in renting this particular movie.  I think Pat Conroy would be very displeased if he saw his amazing book converted into a couple of hours worth of nonsense.  Even the ending was awful.  My two pieces of advice are: 1) If you have read the book, don't ruin your experience by watching the movie.  And 2) If you haven't read the book, do so, but don't watch the movie.

Living in South Carolina, I had an intense interest in this story.  I have watched the movie about 3  times, and most people probably won't do that.  It took multipile viewings  in order for me to like this movie.  I feel that the screenwriters stole  away from author Pat Conroy, by excluding the entire romance between Will  McClean, and Annie Kate Gervais.  David Keith does make one feel like they  know him, with his down-home acting skills, and I thought that was  commendable.  A good mystery for a one time viewing.

He pulls deep from his life in writing this fictitious tale and make it all the more credible.  From his roots as a military brat, to his years at the Citadel, Conroy's  fascination with the complexities of Southern life and society are put into words and brought to life.  His love for the South and his progressive hope for the future meld together in a tale that deeply respects tradition, while calling his fellow man to a higher virtue of love and respect for all.  While a movie can rarely convey all a book can, the movie, of the same title, does a good job in conveying Conroy's work.
