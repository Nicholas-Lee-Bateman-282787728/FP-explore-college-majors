4370847,5,B004FPE4J4,"This DVD is unbelieveable and classic Dennis Miller!  My only complaint is that it is not long enough.  Will watch many times over, you have to watch it multiple times to catch everything.",1302652800,6,188,4.666666666666667
4370848,5,B004FPE4J4,"This is just priceless, timeless Miller at his best. Thank God he took somewhat of a right-turn after 9/11, as did many wingnuts in Jollywood.  Now, FINALLY, SOMEONE in entertainment can turn their extraordinary wit (which heretofore has been used to excoriate the RIGHT exclusively), and with the dexerity of a neurosurgeon, dissect the madness of the left--HILARIOUSLY.  It never ceases to amaze me how effortlessly Miller shows the abject hypocrisy and lunacy of the left and hangs it out for all to see. BRAVO!  Great show, and I hope there will be many more to come!",1298592000,25,571,4.865979381443299

8428189,5,B004FPE4J4,"Even though the material is slightly dated by when this was recorded, it is just as funny as if it were fresh from today's headlines. If you are a fan of Dennis Miller you will love this disc. If you don't laugh at this you either don't have a sense of humor or you're a Democrat. (Oh, I forgot. That's the same thing.)",1444521600,,319,4.079365079365079

8428192,4,B004FPE4J4,"As a regular Fox News Channel viewer I see Dennis Miller on a weekly basis as a guest on the O'Reilly Factor. Overall I find his shtick amusing, if not funny. The same holds true with this comedy special. Of course those on the left will not be too fond of this as Miller shows his fairly conservative views on foreign policy and takes shots at some of those on the left - Barney Frank, Michael Moore and Nancy Pelosi. The latter he reserves a pretty impressive tirade against ending with ""Nancy Pelosi is bat s*** crazy. I guarantee you that woman sleeps upside down.""

Other highlights include a strong critique of the NASA policy of Muslim outreach. Miller's best line of the show ""Muslims will want to go to the moon when the Jews set up Israel there.""

There is some cursing during the show but I don't find it offensive and it's not overdone. Overall an enjoyable viewing experience.",1362960000,3,889,4.515527950310559
8428193,5,B004FPE4J4,"Being a Dennis Miller fan, I had to get this DVD.  You just never know what to expect from Dennis.  This DVD did not disappoint-  from thoughts on elections,  global warming  and a story about Frank Sinatra among other topics.  This DVD was definitely worth the money.  Quality, content worth it.",1362528000,3,296,4.686274509803922
