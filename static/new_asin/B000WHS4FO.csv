2974643,5,B000WHS4FO,I am wheelchair dependent due to MS for the last 18 yrs. This video has helped me to excerize the core muscles and is helping my balance. Great surprise is my blood pressure is down.,1319241600,21,182,4.228571428571429
2974644,5,B000WHS4FO,"I love this DVD.  It is perfect for a person who has problems standing to exercise for whatever reason.  It gives you a window into Tai Chi,  and David takes you through a series of movements that not only get your upper body moving but also center you.  If you follow his instruction, you will learn to breath better, have better control, and actually feel better.  Two thumbs way up!",1315267200,5,385,4.442857142857143
2974645,4,B000WHS4FO,"This is a very interesting and easy to follow DVD that seems so simple yet really gives you a workout! The music and pace are very relaxing and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I haven't done the
2nd workout yet, but if it's as good as the 1st one, I definitely got my money's worth out of the DVD's. Great instructor and the directions are easy to learn and follow even for an uncoordinated person like me!",1309651200,17,399,4.2631578947368425
2974646,5,B000WHS4FO,I love this video.  It has 2 workouts on it.  One is about 20 minutes long and the other is 40 minutes long.  This way I can exercise as much or as little as I have time for.,1286409600,10,174,3.526315789473684
2974647,3,B000WHS4FO,"I was a little disappointed in this video. I expected a lot more exercises not just the two sets.
buy it if you don't know anything about Tai Chi. The instructor is delightful and a pleasure to watch. I just wish it contained more.",1263772800,8,231,4.2727272727272725
2974648,3,B000WHS4FO,"I got this to use when I was recovering from a surgery. I am also at a very low/entry level of fitness. The first time I used it my arms were sore. I hadn't considered the fact that it would be almost all arm movement.  I expected to move my legs some, but that wasn't the case.

The instructor has a very calm manner about him, which was nice. However, the overall feeling was more exercise-y, and less about channeling the chi. This is not particularly useful for a more metaphyisical experience, in my opinion.",1247443200,22,513,4.389473684210526
2974649,5,B000WHS4FO,I thought this DVD was great. I am an exercise instructor myself and I thought this instructor was fun and motivating as well as knowledgable and safe. I had to have my achilles tendon repaired after it ruptured and was very upset at the thought of not being able to do anything but chair boxing helped me through!!! I was actually able to stand and worked out the very next day after my surgery!!! It was great and thanks again!!!,1238198400,22,431,4.4

2974691,3,B000WHS4FO,"This was a bit disappointing. The two 20-minute workouts do work you and strengthen your muscles, but they are repetitive and become boring fairly quickly. And there was no leg work. If I had known this I probably wouldn't have bought it.",1407283200,3,238,4.690476190476191
2974692,2,B000WHS4FO,"its all right I got this for my mother who had a stroke four years ago because shes confined to a wheelchair and needs to movement back. She does it with assistance from me but she really likes her wheelchair workout the best I purchased four vids in total, The best price is going to the web sit and ordering direct from them.",1407110400,4,327,4.2063492063492065

2974695,5,B000WHS4FO,"The video is really good.  There are two routines, a 20 minute routine and a 40 minute routine.  I have only done the 20 min routine.  It didn't occur to me how much my arms would feel it.  I think my balance is improved as well.",1398556800,11,229,3.9130434782608696

8223456,4,B000WHS4FO,"As a DVD I bought for an elderly person, it would be helpful to have a booklet or visual aid to accompany it, as sometimes elderly people don't hear well. I also think the quality of the picture isn't 100%.

That said, this is a perfect DVD for elderly people. It has a 20 minute routine of 7 Tai Chi moves. The instructor has a gentle manner and I'm looking forward to doing this routine regularly. I am very happy with this purchase.",1481328000,,435,4.240963855421687

8223461,1,B000WHS4FO,"Wasn't crazy about-I bought several chair workout dvd's after breaking my foot last year-I am an intermediate to advanced excerciser and hated not being able to do my regular workout routine. This DVD was just dull,regardless of having an injury. I did love his Chair Boxing workout-this one just moved too slow for me. I also loved the Chairacize workout set and Chair aerobics-they were challenging enough to make me sweat.",1428969600,4,425,5.0
8223462,5,B000WHS4FO,"Wonderful work-out for physically-challenged adults who have difficulty standing. Highly recommend it for anyone, but especially us older folks who have trouble with balance anyway.",1426464000,3,181,6.28
