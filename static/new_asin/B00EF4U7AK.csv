5911286,4,B00EF4U7AK,"As viewers, we sometimes relish and wildly enjoy things on screen that we would absolutely detest in person. Action sequences with cars exploding left and right, people being shredded by hails of gunfire, nightmares coming to life wielding insane looking claw-gloves, just to name a few (if you didn't get the last reference, you really need to get out more.) Maybe its our escapist need to experience things far outside our normal lives, or maybe these TV shows and movies allow us to imagine these situations without the responsibility or consequences or living them out. Whatever the case, there are few things more terrifying, frightening and downright anxiety provoking than the theme of this British hit TV show, the snobbish, uppity, full-of-herself, oblivious, insufferable neighbor!

Keeping Up Appearances stars Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket (who routinely reminds everyone that it is pronounced bouquet.) She is a narcissistic social climber with a passion for putting on theatrical efforts to display her upper-class social standing, even though her life is decidedly middle class and her immediate family is hilariously lower class. Everyone, from her husband Richard to the local mailman, has created methods of dealing with her: from suffering quietly to taking cover with the quickness and skill of a ninja (I wouldnt have thought the British had ninjas, but I stand corrected.) No matter how obvious her painful attitude is to everyone around her, Hyacinth exists in her own rose-colored world, supplied with hand painted china and a masterful slimline telephone with auto-dial.

From the very first moment she speaks on screen, you know right away this is a character that you will either love to hate or just hate. The show is a crisp, dry and near-perfect example of British social-class humor from the early-to-mid 90s. There are slapstick moments and routine bouts of physical comedy, but much of the laughter streams from Hyacinth driving everyone around her insane on a routine basis.

During its run the show earned Routledge two BAFTA nominations for her performance and years later, after the show had been off the air for almost a decade, it still managed to rank at number twelve on the list of Britains Best Sitcoms. For American audiences, the show feels like The Jeffersons meets Sanford and Son, with a little bit of Diffrent Strokes tossed on top.

The Collectors Edition Series Box Set is a cleverly developed presentation of the show, coming in a 10-disc container fit inside of a small gardening bag. It comes with three seed packets (with actual seeds) labeled for some of the main characters.

For fans of British comedy that skewers their own class-based society, you can do far, far worse than Routledge and her magnificent performance as Hyacinth Bucket, I mean, Bouquet.",1389312000,3,2821,5.123913043478261

Hyacinth Bucket (She wants it to be pronounced Bouquet) is a woman from a lower middle class family that would like everyone to believe that she comes from money and perhaps even royalty.  She connives every day to improve her status and rub elbows with the elite living in her area.  She tries to convince people that her family is OK but for the most part they are a bunch of misfits and perhaps a little crazy.

Her sisters are named Rose, Violet and Dasiy and Daisy is married to Onslow who is a real piece of work.  His idea of dressing up is wearing a stained sleeveless T-shirt and carrying a beer around all day long. Rose is just crazy and man hungry for anyone.  She will steal your husband in a heartbeat.  Daisy is sweet but she has to put up with her husband Onslow. Hyacinth's father is a womanizer and perhaps more than a bit crazy.  He has been known to be seen out riding a bicycle naked and chasing a woman down the street.

Violet is wealthy and married to a rich man but her marriage is an unhappy one.  Her husband has some real issues in the cross dressing side of life.  Hyacinth thinks of her family as a black sheep family and tries to defend and hide them from the public and her friends.  She is proud that Violet is rich and she likes that she, at least, has a small link to the wealthy. Poor Richard Bucket is Hyacinth's husband and he has the patience of Job.  He makes a good counterbalance to Hyacinth.

What is funny is that every time Hyacinth sets up a plan to rub elbows with the elite or plans a special event her misfit family shows up and ruins it for her.  It is hilarious!

This is a great series and it comes beautifully packaged in a burlap bag type of material with packets of flower seeds with the photos of Rose, Violet and Daisy on them.  There is also included three plant stakes with the photos of Hyacinth, Richard and Daisy/Onslow on them.  I put together a brief video of the packaging and a brief discussion of what is on the discs.  I hope it is helpful to you.  The series is long and it is on 10 discs.  Overall it is 22 hours and 50 minutes of comedy enjoyment.  It is presented in 4:3 video format and the discs do have subtitles included.  I like that as I sometimes have difficulty understanding the British accent or slang.  I could expand the screen size on my 60 inch TV to cover the entire screen and the quality was good.

Here are the contents of the disc:
1. Season 1
2. Season 2, episodes 1 to 5
3. Season 2 episodes 6 to 10
4. Season 3
5. Season 4
6. Season 5 episodes 1 to 5
7. Season 5 episodes 6 to 10
8. Christmas specials
9. Bonus Bucket
10.  Bonus Bucket
Disks 1 through 7 also include outtakes.

This is an excellent season and well worth watching.  It is a classic on English humor and one the top shows of the BBC sitcoms.  I rated it as a 5 star item.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1386460800,108,3399,4.637123745819398
5911291,5,B00EF4U7AK,"I gave this to my Mom, because she loves British television and I'd heard it was a classic. We started watching it together and even I was in stitches with laughter! You don't have to be an Anglophile to enjoy this show. There was never a dull moment, and the woman who plays Hyacinth is just incredible. I would also recommend this as a gift- the episodes looked great, and the packaging is quite lovely. Mom is holding onto the seeds for her garden!",1386201600,3,451,4.380952380952381

5911293,5,B00EF4U7AK,"Having watched this BritCom perennial year after year on PBS, I am amazed at the quality of the picture in this new restored set. All my favorite moments look brand new -- the ""riparian"" outing in which Hyacinth inadvertantly entertained all her friends, Daddy running amok in the toy store, Daisy's toy boy (who was Jonny Lee Miller!) I can't wait to plant the seed packets that came with the set, and see which character grows the best!

The character themed plant tags and seed packets come cutely tucked into a unique gardener-y type pouch. Such a fun gift idea. I've gotten so tired giving the same old boring boxes of just DVDs for Christmas. My mom's only complaint will be that she doesn't the green thumb to do Hyachinth proud with the seeds!!,1386201600,8,451,4.65

Also, I must say that the bonus features are a great addition once you have finished the series and want just a little bit more and the packaging was soo adorable, I can't wait for winter to be over so that I can start planting my seeds, I am not sure if every package is the same but I got flowers - Violets, Daisy and Roses - if you need an idea for a great gift of laughter well this is IT!

5911299,5,B00EF4U7AK,"I love it but honestly, it looks better on older TV's.  You can do 1080p but nothing with upscaling resolution.  It will not look good at all on upscale  TV's and the ginormous screen will only emphasize the obvious.  If you have an older TV with a VCR go for broke and enjoy every wonderful episode.  The little burlap bag and seeds are more comical than useful but the tin the set comes in proved sturdy.  The discs pop off very easily as there are too many placed too closely in the set and during shipment they may end up in a sort of heap or if you drop or shake it.  Still, it's awfully sweet to pop in a Hyacinth whenever you need that special comedic cheering up only she can give.  Some of you with wondrous new high resolution upscaling TV's will have to settle for watching on your computer.",1497657600,2,802,4.230263157894737

She is the maven of good taste and not above telling everyone you can depend on that.  Hyacinth is judgmental, self-absorbed, a social climber of the highest order, dictatorial, an elitist snob, and a bully (I won't take no for an answer!).  Those who find themselves in her orbit soon regret it.  Keeping out of her reach though, is almost impossible.  Shes been accused of singing under false pretenses and forcing people to attend candlelight suppers best left in the dark.  Hyacinths family fears her and her slim-line white phone.  Her husband Richard is docile to a fault, unable to stand up to Hyacinths tyranny.  Although he did correct her once concerning the pronunciation of their name, it was Bucket until I met you.  No!

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

It's a comedy. So you must laugh and you will laugh and with Mrs. Hyacinth Bucket, pronounced bouquet, you shall laugh. That's a request, a demand, an order in one word. So they took very clear characters both socially and mentally, and they knit them together into a real bouquet of flowers, Hyacinth, Violet, Daisy and Rose. The first one is married to Richard, a top local government official who is submissive and flexible and has transformed their home's bathroom into his reading room. She is the tyrant who does not give a suggestion that is not an order, who does not order you around but command the rising of the sun and the shining of the moon.

Violet could have been the same, and she too married at the top of the middle class, with a Mercedes, a swimming pool and room for a pony or two, but her husband, Bruce, is no Richard. So it is a constant chase after divorce in the very sickening way of never getting it to be running after it all the time and forever.

Daisy is a social marginal woman who married sentimentally a man, Onslow, who is a social marginal case living on society, not because he is handicapped or uneducated or even uneducatable, but because he is just one of these slobs who just want to live their life slouching in front of a TV only wasting some energy to go bet on horses, and nowadays they don't even need to go out because they can bet on-line since the Internet is a basic need for everyone, isn't it?

The last one, Rose, is a pathetic woman who only lives in order to fall in love, that is to say to yield to her desires and appeals just in order to break every love affair, if possible with married men, to see it dying in order to chase after another prey, to hunt another game, to fall in love to her own desires and appeals one more time in order then to see it dying. There is no possible empathy for such a woman since her own desire is to constantly run around and around this cycle in the shape of a vicious circle with super short skirts and open neck shirts, or other light chest and breast embracing skimpy pieces of clothing.

You have to add the son of these poor mismatched and yet perfect couple Richard and Hyacinth, a certain, oh by the way what is his name since we did not see him once, isn't it Sheridan, who is in college forever and has just dropped mathematics for a sewing needlepoint class and who does not run after girls because he is too young, so says his mother. And that mother does not seem to wonder why he only has boy friends, I mean friends who are boys or men, which is, according to his mother, good, you know why, because it keeps him safe away from girls for whom he is definitely too young, will be too young till he is too old for anything at all.

But then it is a British, what's more BBC, comedy. So there must be two neighbors, a woman whose husband is living thousands of miles away and her brother who just got divorced. And of course there must be a vicar, Anglican if possible, and his wife and you have it all. We will have no plumber, but a postman and a milkman, a few cops and the father of this bouquet of flowers who is losing his head completely and believes he is still fighting against the Germans.

Such comedies are so perfect that you cannot hesitate to laugh and laugh, again, encore and again still, episode after episode. But in the end you will wonder if there is any abstract value, any higher dimension. You may think your life partner is like one of these characters, or you might think you are like one of these characters, and then you might wonder if that is cathartic or not, if that may liberate you or not. Don't wonder. You will waste your time. It is nothing but a comedy.

A cruel comedy though since episode after episode Mrs. Bucket, pronounced bouquet, is falling down into ever deeper failures, ever nastier tricks devised by life. You can be sure she could not cross the street but be run over by a bus, or go to the seaside but get drowned in a pool of dirty water on the embankment, the promenade des Anglais along the gravelly beach in Nice. She luckily does not go to foreign countries, at least practically never beyond Jersey and the Queen Elizabeth 2, otherwise she might really end up badly, like eaten up by the continental cannibals after slow cooking in a cast iron pot simmering on an open camp fire, soaking in a mixture of mayonnaise and mustard, and probably on Les Champs Elyses in Paris under the Arch of Triumph or on Unter den Linden in Berlin under the Brandenburg Gate.

But well the series does not stop really, only symbolically since at the end of the last Christmas Special she will meet with her demise and Richard will get the order that if she dies he has to make sure Onslow puts a tie on for her funeral. Good bye lady and do not lie in the flower beds for too long. It is more comfortable under the flowers.

5911354,5,B00EF4U7AK,I came across this show via NetFlix and became an instant fan. I knew that it had ended it's Season in 1995. I was thrilled to obtain a copy for my collection. It's hysterically funny and brilliant ! Thank you!,1446336000,,210,4.275
5911355,5,B00EF4U7AK,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened this package.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but let me tell you the dvds are very special.
I am a huge fan of this series and am thinking of purchasing it again as a gift for my Granddaughter.",1445990400,,240,4.0
5911356,1,B00EF4U7AK,"Did not get to watch these collection until a month ago and did not realize the collection lacks one DVD. The snap that holds the tapes is broken.
By the time we watched the last 3 tapes the sound comes on and off. Did not think much of it because the collection was ordered 4 months
ago but when I saw that the product could be reviewed, I decided to do it as my last recourse. It is a bad product for a price of $80.00",1445817600,5,420,3.895348837209302

5911358,4,B00EF4U7AK,I have loved watching this BritCom for years and was sorry when it was replace by another one on my local PBS station.  Now I can watch it whenever I wish.,1439942400,2,155,4.0
5911359,5,B00EF4U7AK,"What makes this show great is first, the writing. The scripts are well written with particular attention to detail. The nuances of the characters are never ignored nor forgotten. And each episode feels like a companion of the last. I appreciate that because it makes the show more genuine and ups the repeated viewing anty.

Another strength are the characters themselves and the cast whom portray them. You can tell they are having fun with this. It shows on screen and containing their own laughter is a treat to watch. I never watched it during its initial run in the 90's. I was in late teens and early twenties then and I thought of the program as ""an old person's comedy"". It wasn't until about twenty years later that I actually sat down and watched an episode. Oh my God - what a laugh riot! I watched the entire series thereafter and fell in love with it. Onslow will always be my favorite character. God bless Onslow - the gentle hulking, but extremely lazy husband of Daisy. Onslow is very intelligent but lacks the will to apply that intelligence or put it to good use to improve the couples ""situation."" His character adds the golden touch to it all. Especially when he interacts with Hyacinth's prim and proper escapades.

Now - this edition. The new extra's are worth the price of a double dip if you've bought individual sets from past releases. My only beef is with the packaging. The sleeves are not the greatest. They're snug and I would strongly suggest, carefully, taking out all the discs, inspect them and if they're okay find another storage alternative for them. I would NOT put them back in the sleeves. It's not worth the risk of scratching them. I hope in a few years time this series will get the Blu-ray treatment. It certainly deserves one.  Enjoy!",1439596800,,1779,4.6234177215189876

I bought an old one, actually two on Ebay and my favorite episode is half cut out, and then it just cuts off. I can't win for losing. I am afraid to buy this again. I called BBC but they were no help at all. I don't know what to do. I just wanted a really good DVD set of My favorite Britcom I am wasting money and not getting what I want.

5911434,5,B00EF4U7AK,"I bought this for my mother, who like me loves the series.  I bought an earlier edition which just came in a collector's box, this one comes with all sorts of extra goodies I didn't get.  But it's all the same show, Hyacinth bucket (that's ""Boookaaayy!"" ) tries to keep up appearances of being waaaaay high class when she's actually lower middle class.  A very funny situation comedy .... and yes it IS a SITUATION COMEDY!",1400198400,,422,4.526315789473684

5911436,5,B00EF4U7AK,Great show.  I have been a fan of KUA for many years.  This is a replacement for the first complete set that I purchased.  My sister borrowed my copy and refused to give it back.,1399852800,,178,4.0285714285714285
5911437,5,B00EF4U7AK,I have watched this show on my local PBS for a long time. Unfortunately only a handful of episodes are shown. Even after watching them over and over I still laugh. I decided to get the series and I'm so glad I did. This will have you laughing so much you'll have to re-wind to avoid missing anything. The actors have great timing (the original Rose was not a good fit but recast early on) and work so well together. I especially love Richard. One drawback is the character of Emmett. He's very whiny.,1399248000,2,500,4.329787234042553

5911441,5,B00EF4U7AK,My boyfriend introduced me to this show and so I thought it would be the perfect gift and it was!  I also bought one for my grandmother and she just loved it too!  The packaging the dvds comes in is extremely nice and convenient to travel with.  We spent many hours laughing together at these episodes.  The sad part came when we had watched them all but this is a comedy you can watch over and and it always makes you laugh!,1394064000,2,425,4.146341463414634
