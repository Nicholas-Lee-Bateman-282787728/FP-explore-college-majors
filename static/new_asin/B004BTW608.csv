8422325,3,B004BTW608,"I collect bad movies from the 70's so I'm happy enough to have this set in my collection, but unless you're die hard into psychedelia, vansploitation, or hicksploitation you may not get much from this set, the prints are good, and there are some good trailers, but no other bonus features. The first film Psychedelic Fever is part documentary, part silk screen pictures over pictures trip out, this movie won't appeal to a lot of people, I actually found the documentary segments interesting, but between the segments there are 10-20 min trip segments of psychedelia that are boring, but there is a lot of hippy nudity in both the docu and psychedelia. The second film Up Yours is essentially silly dated skits from a ""talking building"" if these walls could talk kind of thing, unfortunately it wore on me fast and I only lasted about 30mins into this one, it lacked the charm, humor, or nudity I was hoping for. The third film Summer School was the one I was most looking forward to and it had a lot of the cliche California 70's cheese I was hoping for, vans, beaches, skatebording, arcades, but the story was really flimsy and there was scarcely any nudity at all, and I would've expected a better soundtrack for a movie of this genre and time. The fourth film The Farmers Other Daughter is PG all the way, not at all the exploitation you might expect from the cover and title, it is a nice example of Hicksploitation if you're a fan of such movies this is a nice addition to a collection of that nature, but not a great movie over all, it's silly family fare pretty much. The prints and transfers look pretty good, and the presentation is nice, but this set doesn't have a tremendous amount of replay value for me but will sit nicely in the rare 70's section of my collection.",1354492800,12,1780,4.531055900621118
8422326,5,B004BTW608,"Farm Girl in New York is a great sex/love/bromantic-comedy about the un-glamorous reality of show business in New York.  After catching his fiance cheating on him with two of his groomsmen, Sam, along with his best friend Matt, abandon small-town Pennsylvania for New York City.  They're hoping to make it big and meet lots of women.  Once they arrive in the big apple, however, they find both success and the opposite sex as elusive as ever before.  Out of desperation to meet women, the two friends decide to hold an ""audition"" for a play that doesn't exist.  They get more then they bargained for when hundreds of women show up to audition for a part, and they're all willing to go all out to get cast.  When Sam falls in love with one of the aspiring actresses (and Matt falls in lust with another), the friends are forced to try and put together a real play in order to get the girls.  Sexy hi-jinx and desperate measures ensue.
The comedy in Farm Girl tends to be of the over-the-top variety. The two male leads have an excellent comedic rapport reminiscent of Clerks or Chasing Amy. The ensemble as a whole is zany as well as sympathetic, and they pull off slapstick as well as heartfelt subtlety. My favorite touch is the self-aware soundtrack that satirizes the genre even as it moves the storyline forward.
For what it is, a low-budget, raunchy comedy, Farm Girl in New York meets every expectation, and it delivers much more intelligence and wit than one typically finds in this type of movie.  It is a ludicrous romp well worth watching.",1328745600,,1549,4.607272727272727
8422327,1,B004BTW608,"I bought this dvd on the recommendation of people on a blog I belong to.  Bad mistake.  This would have to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Supposed to be a comedy?  Well I didn't smile once the whole way through, let alone laugh. Poor storyline, very over-acted, no wonder it went straight to DVD.",1299283200,,311,4.220338983050848
8422328,5,B004BTW608,I saw this movie when it premiered in New York City. I couldn't stop laughing. Everyone who has ever auditioned for anything should see it.,1296345600,,139,4.6
