8714680,2,B00WZY4EXS,"Full disclosure:  I watched this film on Netflix.  After seeing it I read the reviews there which were largely negative.  The average was about two stars and there were many who gave it one star.  Then I came over here and was surprised at the five star rating and glowing reviews.  I add mine here, only to give potential viewers a fuller range of opinions before they click or buy.

From the reviews here I learned that the writer/director is an Italian living in America.  This makes  sense of the movie to me.  I can understand the attraction.  Her parents are devout fundamentalist Christians who home school the kids to avoid bad influences from public school.  The girls wear long loose skirts even while doing farm chores.  The father seems like a surly fellow who berates Sara for not driving posts in straight.  The mother is all warmth and Biblical advice, warning the girls that life will not always be easy and that a woman must submit to the man.  Yikes...one can imagine the amount of submission this woman has gone through. This is an actual family playing the part of the family. The kids seems happy enough although Sara is never seen to smile,

She is interested, however, in a neighbor, boy her age who comes from a different type of family, one that enjoys bull riding.  These boys are religious, too, in their own way but apparently have a much more liberal and lively lifestyle.
She meets this boy while selling the goat cheese.  He likes her and gives her little brothers rides on their mechanical.bull.  He invites Sara to try it.  She adamantly refuses. but clearly her interest in life beyond the strictures of her family has been piqued.

 Nothing much happens except that we get lots of close ups of Sara which apparently are to show that she is going through some inner anguish.  This would be effective if the child chosen had a more expressive  face.  This girl although healthy and strong and has pretty long blond hair  is not what anyone would call attractive or even interesting.  She has an abrupt way of speaking and lacks the natural radiance of a 14 year old girl.  She rarely smiles and shows no emotion. (Probably because of that grump of a father). One can sympathize with her but she doesn't make for a compelling subject of a full feature length film.  This certainly isn't the fault of the girl but it is a mistake on the part of the film maker, in my opinion.

The film operates almost like a documentary.  We see Sara bringing in the goats, milking them, making the cheese.  This takes up a large portion of the film and may be of interest to some.  I found the scenes with the cowboy family much more interesting, at least more fun.  The young fellow who plays the male interest is quite lively and charming.

I expected more interaction between the two.  There is little except some long silences while they hang on the fence and look at the bulls.  I understand that the point of the film is to show the inner struggle of the young girl as she apprehends a life completely different than the one she has been shown.  There is plenty of input from the Mom about not dating for fun and not giving her heart to anyone until it's the one she will be with for life.  Fun does not seem to be a priority in this household..  Nothing much happens externally and that's ok but I think the film maker has failed to give us the sympathetic picture of this young girl that he has intended to do  It aims at being heartwarming but  it did not have that effect on me.  .

The film has some sociological value as a study of this family but this type of thing has been done elsewhere in much better ways. It isn't informative enough to rate as a documentary and I think it fails as entertainment. ,  .",1442707200,,3736,4.446902654867257
8714681,5,B00WZY4EXS,"Roberto Minervini is an Italian director who elected to share this sensitive coming of age story about 14 year old girl in a family of goat farmers in Texas. Without the benefits of a cast of actors he manages to create not a documentary but instead a quiet observation of what life is like in the rural parts of a too fast world  a place where values are different if not always better.

Sara is a young girl raised in a family of goat farmers. Her parents homeschool their twelve children, rigorously following the precepts of the Bible. Like her sisters, Sara is taught to be a devout woman, subservient to men while keeping her emotional and physical purity intact until marriage. When Sara meets Colby, a young amateur bull rider, she is thrown into crisis, questioning the only way of life she has ever known. STOP THE POUNDING HEART is an exploration of adolescence, family and social values, gender roles, and religion in the rural American South. With minimal dialogue, amateur non-actors, and majestically beautiful cinematography this is a film that is a pastoral. It deserves our attention.

8714683,5,B00WZY4EXS,"Sara is fourteen and has been homeschooled with her eleven siblings. She has been raised in accordance with the teachings of the Bible and has been brought up to believe in subservience to male authority. She is a loving young woman who has an affinity with the goats that they farm for a living and takes care of the younger children.

Then she meets Colby who is an amateur bull rider and all of a sudden she begins to question her long held beliefs and attitudes.

This is a film from Roberto Minervini who has been described as an ethnographer in his films. It is easy to see why, as he uses the camera to observe rather than to dictate what happens on screen. It has the feeling of documentary rather than a film. It feels as though everyone are just being themselves and there is no actual `acting' taking place. The scenes have a casual beauty in how even the mundane is captured and there is no attempt to make judgements on any of the things that take place.

This is a film for those who like to savour their cinema; that do not need to be rushed or told what the message is. It is gentle and even poetic in many ways and fans of `action' movies should probably avoid. I found it to be almost mesmerising in many ways, you just go along for the ride and never expect what will take place next. This was part of the official selection at Cannes and you can see why. This I can wholeheartedly recommend to people who like something different yet rewarding from films.",1435017600,4,1475,4.336956521739131
