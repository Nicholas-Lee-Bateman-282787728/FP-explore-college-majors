7381723,4,B0142WELF6,"Less talk, more action and finally sexy! That's the new Hitman! While critics beat the movie down with their ""professional"" reviews I applaud it since finally, after a long long time (see Riddick, 2013) there's an action movie which focuses more on the action and less on empty mono/dialogues and talks about who's the bigger baddie and who's gonna rule the world (see Gotham, 2014; Jupiter Ascending, 2015; and many, many others). And so while ""movie experts"" compete to find the most nonsense in the movie I will gladly continue to take delight in this stunning glorification of violence with breathtaking photography and luxurious futuristic shots.",1441670400,111,651,5.150943396226415
7381724,3,B0142WELF6,"As the summer draws to a close,  Fox ends its summer run at the movies with the movie: Hitman Agent 47.

What works surprisingly well for Hitman Agent 47 as a movie is that Rupert Friend's portrayal of the popular assassin is spot on in more ways than none. While Timothy Olyphant's 47 was bald in the 2007 film much like the video game character, Rupert Friend is able to convey 47's mannerisms and style in a more believable manner. Hannah Ware's character Katia makes for a solid, though not entirely satisfying supporting character. And as a movie, Hitman Agent 47 delivers some timely action scenes. I also like how ""Diane"" (a nod to Diana from the games) is utilized in this movie as opposed to the 2007 movie.

Unfortunately, not all of Hitman Agent 47 is good. Aside from an uneven story, Hitman Agent 47 lacks an interesting supporting cast. Despite being mostly indestructible,  Zachary Quinto's character John Smith never really feels as imposing or threatening as the antagonist. The story never feels as exciting as it tries to be, and it does lacks  certain qualities of the games. Though it doesn't always entertain, Hitman Agent 47 ends up being only just average despite a good performance by Rupert Friend and some nice action scenes.

While Fox has ended its summer run at the movies on a particularly disappointing note(this and Fantastic Four), I do think their upcoming movies like The Martian and Joy will entertain audiences better than Fantastic Four and Agent 47 have. We have yet to have a thoroughly good video game adaptation, and as a fan of both Michael Fassbender and the Assassin's Creed games I hope Fox does justice to that particular series with the 2016 movie adaptation. Hitman Agent 47 gets

Rated R",1441497600,6,1749,4.768211920529802
7381725,4,B0142WELF6,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.

It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.

7381726,3,B0142WELF6,"First, I have never played the video game that this picture is based on. So, Im reviewing it as a regular moviegoer. I do not compare it to the game.
Second, before going to see this movie at the theatre, I knew it had a low-budget compared to a regular Hollywood one, only 35 million dollars. However it turned out to be unexpectedly entertaining because of the factors listed below.

It contained some interesting dialogues and twists. For example, during an interrogation, the conversation went like this:
Interrogator: Whats your name?
Assassin: Hitman 47.
 Interrogator: Thats not a name.
Assassin: No. But its my name. And then, he did something spectacular that I did not foresee. Its exciting!

In another scene, his conversation with a woman went like this:
Assassin: There are many armed men coming here.
She replied: Youre wrong. Theres only one. The next thing that happened caught me by surprise. Its interesting.

The editing was effective. It made the action scenes intense, quick and deadly. I had no moment of boredom.
The special effects were eye-catching.
The acting was convincing.
Theres some character development regarding father and daughter relationship and changing ones life by not doing something.
In short, this film is worth watching once.",1440892800,3,1269,5.086538461538462
7381727,4,B0142WELF6,"Hitman the video game series is all about stealth and remaining under the radar for as long as possible. This movie ignores that concept most of the time, taking the shoot first and forget about sneaking around approach.
Knowing from the trailers they were going for action instead of stealth, I went into Agent 47 with an open mind, knowing it's probably going to take a lot of liberties with the game property. With that mindset, I did enjoy the movie and found the action scenes entertaining and the story actually interesting, where a daughter is searching for her father, a thread which eventually reveals much more to the plot than first imagined.

Action scenes included: Escape from enemy building, escape from police station, subway to street shootout chase, Audi Car chase in parking garage with bikes, Audi street shoot out where the car caught by rappel hooks, helicopter attack, final battle on roof top. Bottomline:  Agent 47 is a Good action movie for those who can put the attachments to the game aside.

Most things tie up nicely by the end despite a few questions left open, but the main plot worked and there is plenty of emotion in the film. The connection between the stoic Agent 47 and his relation to this woman was a highlight of the film. Zachary Quinto (from Star Trek - Spock) does a nice job as the villain. Rupert Friend is a believable Agent 47, and the actress playing the target did a believable, emotional job in the role.",1440633600,39,1455,4.67578125
7381728,3,B0142WELF6,"honestly i enjoyed it, not movie of the year but was worth the ticket price for my girlfriend and i to see it and ill buy it wen it comes out on blue ray, the 2007 hitman movie did not feel like hitman, rupert friend does an awesome job as 47 for anyone thinking about seeing it just don't go in to it expecting to much and i think you'll enjoy it",1440633600,,347,3.8333333333333335
7381729,4,B0142WELF6,"This movie contained a good amount of action scenes as well as a many well-known actors/actress. The story plot was well stated and the movie was entertaining. This movies shows that Hollywood can produce a good movie without adding inappropriate things. Saying that, their are some parts of the movie that could have been better but overall I think it was a decent action movie compared to some of the other action movies that have been released this year. The movie did feel a little short in which things such as the clones, agency, etc.. seemed to have been lacking as far as going in depth to explain. I would give this movie a 3.5 or 4 star for good action scenes, great acting, good story line, and how well they brought out the personality of the Hitman.",1440460800,,762,4.528985507246377
7381730,1,B0142WELF6,"In the 1997 film Boogie Nights at the rap up of an adult film the camera man character looks with dismay at what he has helped create and disgustedly comments It is what it is.  That may well serve as the epitaph for Hitman: Agent 47.  It is what it is.  We do not expect very much from movies based on video games but surely the film makers can do better than this uninteresting, soul-less shootum up.  When the high body count tops the list of good things about the movie the movie is not very good.  In days gone by we had a movie actually called Shootum Up that had a lot more going for it as a tongue in cheek sent up of the genre than this supposedly straight faced actioner.
 In the origin film Hitman we learn that people have been bio-engineered to be perfect killers.  Things like fear, compassion, love and naturally empathy have no role in these things with a human shape.  In film or literature we need to be able to identify with or at least to understand and like the star of the story, otherwise we have no interest in his life or death, no matter how spectacular the danger he faces.  You can see the problem with the film which has as its center a person with his human qualities stripped from him.  The creators of the film might as well have us rooting for a Zombie or a robot to win out over actual humans.
 Sometimes an unlikely film premise can be made interesting by clever writing and innovative directorial tricks.  That would be too much to ask of Polish born first time director Aleksander Bach.  He plods through the film rather than dazzling us with his imagination.  Writers Skip Woods (Hitman, Wolverine) can do better as can his co-writer Michael Finch (Predators, The November Man) but apparently the producers asked them to write exactly what they wrote.  Too bad that the level of expectation reached only to the ankle.  We in the dark seats have the expectation that the film makers will reach for the stars.
 We expect and can tolerate plot absurdities in an action film.  One of the characters has subcutaneous titanium, a sort of a built in flak jacket.  We have seen worse in films about invisible girls, living rock men, walking plant humanoids and the like.  Here it seems like a cheap plot device.
 I pity the poor actors trapped in this unpleasant film.  Rupert Friend does what little is possible to make the Hitman interesting but fails.  English actress Hannah Ware cannot do much with the role written for her.  Zachary Quinto, lately as Spock in the renewed Star Trek franchise does his best.  We also get to see a brief appearance by Chinese actress Angelbaby and in the one good performance in the film, Ciaran Hinds.  I mention Angelbaby only because I love her stage name.  Ciaran Hinds has such power as an actor that anything he does stands out from the background noise.  He has appeared in two of the greatest TV epics, perhaps the two best of all time, Rome as Julius Caesar and in the ongoing Game of Thrones as Mance Rayder.
 I won't bore you with the details of the plot of a movie made from a very successful Danish video game.  Suffice it to say that the Hitman has faster reflexes than ordinary people so he can shoot just a bit faster than anyone else and score a kill shot every time.  He does that over and over and over again with no style or originality.  Ho hum.
 This single saw blade time waster caries an R rating for violence.  It runs a blessedly short one hour and 36 minutes.  The producers wasted $35 million to make Hitman: Agent 47 which grossed only $16.7 million worldwide over the three day week end.  Dont bother with this one.",1440374400,7,3612,4.4361702127659575

7381812,4,B0142WELF6,"First, let's get this out of the way. This is not as good as the video game that spawned it. Rupert Friend almost looks the part but simply doesnt have that Agent 47 quality. It is a little like if you had Jennifer Aniston play Lara Croft.

Rupert isn't helped by a plot that suffers from this time its personal syndrome (see latest Bond films). Everybody is someone's sister, father, cousin, former chiropractor's receptionist. It is a tired idea that has been beaten to death in action films of late.

So the acting is subpar, the story is filled with tired tropes and it doesnt do justice to the source material. Thank god it looks so good and the action set pieces that start okay get more spectacular as the movie moves along.

If you can get past the someone subpar opening bit that is more Steven Seagal than Terminator the ride improves. That all this movie really is, a forgettable ride among some nice scenery. Sometimes that is enough for a Saturday night on the couch with the wife.",1485043200,,994,4.511111111111111

The quite unsurprising, yet still, truly gobsmacking and painful fact is Hollywood just doesn't get it, they just don't ever ever learn! I mean seriously, a child picks up things quicker than Hollywood. They are creating an adaptation of a popular videogame franchise, they know what has happened before, they know what people want, they know about the pitfalls, but somehow...some bloody how...they make all the same mistakes again. I here by present to you my review of 'Resident Evil 6: Agent 47'. So, there's this single agent bloke, he's a super soldier, assassin, clone, type bloke with all the trimmings you would expect. Speed, strength, agility, intelligence, super reflexes, bigger than average cock...the list goes on.

But the truth is, of course, that Orlando Bloom isn't in Hitman: Agent 47. The lead actor is an eerily similar looking Rupert Friend and youve likely seen him once or twice in other movies or TV (2005s Pride & Prejudice, TVs Homeland). Friend plays the stoic heightened human killing machine simply known as Agent 47. Hes kind of like an underground Captain America but, you know, without the shield and with a penchant for killing. This movie delivers the action goods and looks slick while doing it. It has a Matrix vibe without the Matrix darkness. Action fans should like it. Anyone who likes The Transporter movies (with Statham at least) should get a kick out of this. But this is maybe one of those movies that you also have to be careful when you watch it because it makes killing look cool and feel like a video game (for which the movie is based off ofnever played it myself). Its a movie that will make many viewers rightfully uncomfortable after certain types of tragic mass killings, like the Columbine massacre. So viewer beware.

Timothy acted his role great, but the truth is, 47 has, quite simply, no interest in love, because he did not know love, because that is the way he was genetically engineered so therefore a more confusing type of reaction to a woman showing him affection coupled with the hardness of him being a cold blooded killer was more accurately portrayed in this movie, Hitman Agent 47, than the other one. #GetItRight",1472169600,,574,4.637254901960785

Anyone really familiar with those will see the similarities inspite of the disguises & changes.  But it is a fast paced, hi-tech, very watchable movie with espionage & intrigue.

7382100,5,B0142WELF6,"Action packed and amusing.

PROS:  The Hitman Agent 47 movie was much better than another done regarding this video game series. I feel like Rupert Friend did a great job representing Agent 47 and I appreciated the hard work he put into making it happen. Further, the action really got me - they did not hold back on the gore. Some comedic moments did occur which made some of the slower moments less monotonous. The music helped make the movie as well with powerful scores - one which seemed to be rather overused and had different versions throughout though...

CONS: The story does progress rather fast from A to Z and a lot happens that may be hard for some audiences to swallow and you may find yourself going, ''wait, what?"" a few times. Stiffness in some actors was definitely noted.  It is a movie based off a video game so many people who don't or have not played it WILL definitely be confused. A lack of true depth noted. If the movie gets more sequels/prequels this can be better addressed.

OVERALL: Great movie if you're looking for action.",1462060800,6,1054,4.555555555555555

(Spoiler Alert: No, he killed a lot more).  Was this released around Christmas or another holiday that uses the color red?  Like maybe Agent 47 is the Santa Claus to the bad guys, bringing a gleeful end of life to the ""naughty list"".  Possibly.  Maybe the only thing relatable in this movie for me was the lack of over-the-top muscle tone common these days to the heroes in action movies/ warm family holiday movies.  It was like an Armani model combined with the matrix to make a snuff film.

After the disappointing first Hitman movie and the poor reviews of this one, I wrote this one off. But somehow I found myself watching this version and I'm so pleasantly surprised.

7382172,3,B0142WELF6,"The move is good. Not as good as the first one. The plot is predictable in places, but has surprises. As its based on a video game, the entire premise is unbalanced. But it has a solid story, and good characters.

For those unfamiliar with the story lines, Agent 47 was raised to be an assassin. In this version, his genetics were custom designed, and his ""name"" was his production order. The movie provides backstory on the program that created him, and various groups wanting to restart the program or prevent it from being restarted. Its difficult to be more specific without giving away the plot.",1459036800,,600,4.660377358490566
7382173,4,B0142WELF6,needs more stories to advance characters and franchise,1459036800,,54,5.875
7382174,3,B0142WELF6,I love the movie.  Sometimes it is nice to let go of logic and just let your mind flow with the movie. One thing I am disappointed in is the sound affects  are great but when the actors are speaking you can barely hear them. So you have to turn up the volume to be blow away by the sound affects. This is why I only give this three stars.  Could be I got a bad disk.,1459036800,,366,3.727272727272727
7382175,4,B0142WELF6,"Lots of action throughout, ok plot, I liked Timothy Olyphant as an agent better, however this one was also good. On the blueray I noticed a small addition (or i missed it in the theatre) at the very end which I thought was an improvement",1458950400,,237,4.288888888888889

7382178,5,B0142WELF6,"500 armed men and one Agent 47...and guess who's standing at the end?  That sums up the plot pretty well. It doesn't go into the depth of the characters, however, for it seems that in spite of being genetically engineers to be merely a perfect killing machine, somewhere inside Agent 47 there does dwell a spark of humanity, even if he hides it well.

There was exposition at the beginning but I must've blinked, because I never really understood how they settled on that ""one child"" though her turning out to be who she was made it plain later. Also the dialogue going along with why she was going through what must've been a newspaper photo morgue searching for someone when apparently she didn't even know who she was looking for was really pretty oblique. If it was supposed to pique the viewers interest, my conclusion was that it more confused.  Of course, there again, perhaps I simply didn't catch it.

Good scenery, long actions scenes...and escapes, with Agent 47 not wasting bullets...since he hits the target with the first shot. This entry in what looks to now be a series ends well but leaves it open for another, and all I have to say is...keep 'em coming!",1458864000,,1171,4.615384615384615

This however was disappointing. Rupert Friend, looks somewhat like a younger Agent 47, but it ends there. Instead of the stealth-driven action of the games, 47 in this film is usually anything but stealthy. The script was sub-par, the character relationships felt forced, and the spirit of the games was almost nowhere to be found. Some of the gunplay action sequences were semi-enjoyable, but not enough to redeem the movie. Stick with the 2007 film.",1457395200,,602,4.911764705882353

7382349,3,B0142WELF6,"This follow-up to the original Hitman from 2007 isn't really a sequel, its a reboot from what I can tell.  Rupert Friend (TVs Homeland) replaces Timothy Oliphant from the original.  Early on he appears to be after a young woman named Katia (Hannah Ware, Shame) who is on the run from some sinister organization trying to find the whereabouts of Katias father, Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds).  Years earlier, Litvenko developed a process to turn normal young people into killing machines, e. g. 47.  When he tried to kill the program, the sinisters weren't happy, killing his wife.  Litvenko leaves his young daughter in a drain pipe and disappears for 20 years.  Thanks Dad.  Well he did leave an mental imprint on young Katia, special skills to hide and evade.

So all this time Katia is trying to find dear old Dadalong with the sinisters who believe Katia knows where he is.  So the chase is on.  Another dude shows up just as Katia is about to be corralled by 47.  John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is out to help Katia.  Or is he?  Based on a video game, both 47 and Smith have special skills, primarily the ability to beat the sh*t out of anyone who gets in their way.  47 is very adept at shooting as well.  In one scene hes able to place a bullet into a speeding car, already across town.  In traffic.  At night.  And only an intended flesh wound.  ALREADY ACROSS TOWN!  This is a silly movie with an even sillier premise.  Still it aint all bad.  There is plenty of action including a very cool scene where 47 and Smith tangle along the tracks of a commuter train, with trains whizzing by.  Still weve seen it all before.

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p resolution with an original 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The video quality is first rate.  The film has a stark background most of the time including the bare industrial look of the lair of the bad guys.  The detail is exceptional, down to the fine hair on Katias arms and creases and blemishes on various close ups.  The lighting in this film is really excellent and it comes through convincingly on the disc.  The audio quality is as good as it gets with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix.  As you might expect, all the speakers get a good workout including the subs.  Dialogue is clear and easily understood.  Here are the extras:

7382359,5,B0142WELF6,"If you're after a realistic movie Hitman Agent 47 will probably disappoint but if you're after a fun once it gets going non stop action film, then this is a great choice  At first this seemed like a remake of the original Terminator movie with a young woman (Hannah Ware), Sarah Connor style (not knowing why someone that she and the viewer are quickly noticing is not just an average human (Rupert Friend), is relentlessly pursing her, while a Kyle Reese type stranger (Heroes' Zachary Quinto) keeps telling her to do what he says, shoves her out of the way and battles the pursuer.  They even take refuge in a police station (US Embassy) style scenario.  This was way better than any of the third or more movie sequels in the Terminator franchise, having hoped for another great sequel and being disappointed time and time again, I was more than happy for this to be a remake.  But it isn't just that it turns into its own movie and it's pretty fun, albeit a lot of scenes are pretty predictable.

This might be based on a video game but I've never played that or even seen screen shots or anything so watched this one as a completely stand alone experience separate from the game.  As simply a movie, it was a lot of fun!",1455840000,,1224,4.441964285714286

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Say hello to Agent 47 [Rupert Friend], the eponymous killing machine in this adaptation of the popular videogame. During a rare moment of quiet amid the glass-smashing, brain-bashing mayhem of the HITMAN: AGENT 47 film, a character offers the wise observation that we are all a bit more complicated than our internal circuitry might suggest. Applying this logic to the movie itself, its fair to conclude that while Aleksander Bachs directing debut is indeed in this shoot-em-up film.

For those of you who have already been to see the film HITMAN: AGENT 47, will have no idea that it is a reboot of the original HITMAN [2007] film, where we had the forgettable EuropaCorp-produced first film adapted from the IO Interactive videogame about a chrome-domed, genetically engineered contract killer. Ruthlessly precise in his targeting and virtually invincible, the first Agent 47 was played by Tim Olyphant in the first film HITMAN and is embodied here by the steely-gazed Rupert Friend, who coolly donning the characters familiar black suit, white shirt and red necktie. He also sports a back-of-the-head barcode tattoo that serves as a continual visual reminder that Agent 47 was cooked up in a government laboratory way back in the 1960s, and that he is a cold-blooded killer devoid of such ordinary human qualities as fear, compassion and love.

In the new film, however, 47s mission is not to preserve and uphold his murderous order, but rather to destroy it, or at least keep it from being permanently reinstated. To do that, he must head to Berlin and track down Katia van Dees [Hannah Ware], a guarded young woman whos spent her entire life looking over her shoulder, and not without reason. As is revealed soon enough, Katia van Dees possesses both a mysterious ability to foresee the immediate future and a mysterious connection with Dr. Piotr Litvenko [Ciar&aacute;n Hinds], the scientist who first devised the Agent program. Also in the mix is John Smith [Zachary Quinto], a highly skilled fighter who early on assumes the role of Katia van Deess protector, giving her fair warning about exactly what kind of danger shes up against. Together they will reinforce the well-known cinematic truth, that if you're looking for a place to hide, you should really steer clear of your nearest U.S. embassy, where Agent 47 stages an audacious, foolhardy assault on Katia van Dees, John Smith and the laws of probability.

HITMAN: AGENT 47 plays like a high-production Hitman fan-film during its action bits; and like the film school project of an untested director, in this case, first time feature-film Aleksander Bach. Director Aleksander Bach tries to use exotic locations, high-concept architecture or sharp interior design as substitutes for actual skill and confidence behind the camera, but its not nearly enough camouflage to cover his inexperience at the helm. Virtually every one of the scenes in HITMAN: AGENT 47 takes place in some kind of interesting settings and very different locations around the world.

When the action does kick-in, fans do get the sort of John Wick-style of Gun Fu that is satisfying on a visceral and totally fantastical level. HITMAN: AGENT 47 makes a point of emphasising the brutality of its violence, which is more hilarious than shocking, given how the kills are staged with the hyper-real feel of video game virtual reality, complete with bloody traps and savage executions that are dutifully crafted in emulation of the Hitman games. Indeed, the most praise-worthy aspect of HITMAN: AGENT 47 are the flickers of brilliance it shows when staging certain sequences that actually capture the look, feel, and player interactivity of the games, but these flickers are few and brief when they do appear.

Hannah Ware provides a good enough performance, its just a performance suited for a different film. Her on-the-run and mentally rattled character is supposed to be moving and captivating, but in the context of this film, theres not enough quality material for the story-wise or in dialogue to support that gravitas. Things grind to an agonizing halt whenever Agent 47 moves away from the mayhem of its namesake, in order to focus on Katia van Deess dramatic story of self-discovery. Meanwhile, Zachary Quintos John Smith floats somewhere between these warring sides of the film, never quite taking shape until the very end. To be fair, both Hannah Ware and Zachary Quinto, and of course their stunt doubles, look convincing enough in the films action moments.

In the end, HITMAN: AGENT 47 is a has some missed opportunity to translate one of the more adaptable video games into a satisfying film experience, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of this brilliant shoot-em-up film. Like The Punisher it is also a comic book transferred to films, the conundrum of why a popular game character so basic in premise, who is a great hitman, cant make it to the screen intact, after multiple tries, is almost more interesting than the film itself. Hopefully, the upcoming wave of developer-led gaming films have something better to offer, because if HITMAN: AGENT 47 is almost certainly going to be too much of a generic action film for those heavily invested in the game franchise, and too video game-like for those who aren't. For a group somewhere in the middle, however, those who just want to see some fun stunts and a bunch of fairly good action sequences strung together with more than a little flair, the movie provides enough to sustain its brief runtime. That is, provided one doesn't think too much about why any of the action takes place. All in all, it is a film you must leave your brain outside and just sit back for a rollercoaster ride of your life, as it is not a film you have to be pompous and intellectual about.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment exciting action packed HITMAN: AGENT 47 film, and if youve ever seen an action film, then choosing this one for your Blu-ray Collection, then I can tell you that it definitely rings a bell, and I will say that the visual presentation is pretty awesome and it does embody what weve come to expect with this Blu-Ray disc. With an impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and an equally stunning 1080p encoded image, is sharp as a knife, offering up detail so realistic youd feel as if you can reach out and touch it. Of course the film has meaning, so some of the more stylized scenes rely on some camera tricks, but do give a very unique look and feel. Black levels are solid, contrast is fine and but some people out there have complained to the contrary and have said to have been left out in the cold. Well that is there personal opinion of the film might be low, but to me it looks totally amazing images.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment brings us this exciting action packed HITMAN: AGENT 47 film that accompanying the visuals is kick ass 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. And to get the best out of this film and I can say that this is one that you can turn up the volume, sit back and be totally amazed. The experience is an aural orgasm with sounds creating a dizzying experience that certainly fits the theme of the film and gives all your speakers a good workout. Vocals are pure; surrounds play a big part as do with your speakers working overtime with the dynamic surround sounds that hit you and the film definitely earns their keep here. The sound of a bullet through flesh and the screeching of tyres never sounded so good. Like the visuals, this is totally amazing.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [4:03] You have a choice of three separate titles to view and they include Fabian Hanging; Warehouse Wrecking Ball and Construction Fight. You can either watch them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: The Hit Counter [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [96:00] Admittedly this is kind of neat, where you get a running commentary of sorts with a PiP window panels appearing in different parts of the TV screen throughout the full length of the film and at the start you are informed that HITMAN: AGENT 47 was first brought to our attention with the first film HITMAN, but it was originally conceived with the release of the a computer game entitled HITMAN: CODENAME 47 which first exploded on the scene on the 19th November, 2000, which required two years of development. But of course this is only the tip of the iceberg and you will have to view the rest of the film to find out more in-depth information. What you also get to view is artists impressions and computer simulation at certain parts of the film. But I suggest giving this a view another time when you feel up to watching the film again. Anyway this is very tongue in cheek and it shows the film doesnt take itself too seriously.

Special Feature: Re-Imagining Hitman [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [6:02] This feature has the cast and crew talk to us about the film, complete with some in-depth behind-the-scenes footage and short excerpts from the film. The contributions include Rupert Friend [Agent 47]; Zachary Quinto [John Smith] and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds [Dr. Piotr Litvenko].

Special Feature: Ultimate Action: Staging the Fights [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:54] We get a look at the set and how some of the action scenes were choreographed. You also get to view lots of behind-the-scene filming and the actual film sequences related to show you what it looks like in the actual film. We also get contributions from Rupert Friend [Agent 47]; Hannah Ware [Katia van Dees]; Aleksander Bach [Director]; Zachary Quinto [John Smith], Jonathan Eusebio [Stunt Coordinator]; Adrian Askarieh [Producer] and Jon Valera [Stunt Coordinator].

Special Feature: Hitman: Agent 47 Comic [2015] [1080p] [2:20] This special feature is composed of a series of 28 still images from the official HITMAN: AGENT 47 Boom!! Studios comic book and the images are absolutely stunning. To view the images you have to first select Auto Advance to launch the slide show where the images will change every five seconds. Press || on your remote if you want to pause on an image. Select Manual Advance to step through the images individually. Press >> on your remote to step back to the previous image. Press Top Menu or Disc Menu to exit the gallery.

Special Feature: Making of the Comic Book [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:49] Here we get to see HITMAN: AGENT 47 Official Movie Prequel Comic, and we also get contributions from Adrian Askarieh [Producer]; Stephen Christy [Boom! Studios]; F. E. DeSanto [Comic Book Writer]. What is discussed is how they wanted to transfer the action sequences in the comic book, to what they wanted to appear in the actual HITMAN: AGENT 47 film, to try and make it look as just as good as the images in the comic book, but in some cases where words appear in the comic book speech bubbles, they felt that the words were superfluous and instead they felt the action sequences would speak for themselves.

Special Feature: Promotional Featurettes [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:28] Here you get to view five separate features, which consist of Agent 47: Around The World; Agent 47: Ultimate Hitman; Who is John Smith; Creating Katia van Dees and Iconic. Again you can either view it feature separately or Play All. But what you do get to view is contributions from Aleksander Bach [Director]; Adrian Askarieh [Producer]; Rupert Friend [Agent 47]; Hannah Ware [Katia van Dees]; Zachary Quinto [John Smith], Alex Young [Producer] and Jon Valera [Stunt Coordinator]. What you also get to see and hear everyone talking about the character Agent 47 in the film, plus you get clips from the HITMAN: AGENT 47 film, to show you where the action sequences appear.

Special Feature: Gallery [2015] [1080p] [1:03] With this special feature you get to view 12 stunning images from the 20th Century Fox studio promotional photos from the HITMAN: AGENT 47 film.

Special Feature: Poster Gallery [2015] [1080p] [1:03] With this special feature you get to view 12 stunning images from the 20th Century Fox studio promotional cinema posters from the HITMAN: AGENT 47 film and you get to view some fantastic designs.

Theatrical Trailers: Here you get to view four Original Theatrical Trailers which are spectacular and they are as follows:

Theatrical Trailer 1 [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:26] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film HITMAN: AGENT 47.

Theatrical Trailer 2 [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:26] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film HITMAN: AGENT 47.

Theatrical Trailer 3 [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:26] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE REVENANT.

Theatrical Trailer 4 [2015] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:26] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

Finally, the Blu-ray is well put together; they could have added an audio commentary or even more actual behind-the-scenes documentaries. For example, how they made the HITMAN: AGENT 47 film etc. Other than that, the bonus features are very nice additions to an action or video game fanatic fans. You won't be ashamed to have this on your shelf next to Resident Evil and the like. The films saving grace is that it does have some brilliant stunning outstanding action sequences. Here, Aleksander Bach shows a real ability to provide heart-stopping moments. The fact that these characters have special abilities allows them to pull off some incredible stunts that would kill ordinary humans. 47s gunfight with the rappelling forces of Syndicate International in downtown Singapore. The final shootout upon the rooftop of a high rise building was also my highlight viewing. If you clamour for the very definition of shoot-em-up action, without wondering what it is all about, then HITMAN: AGENT 47 certainly foots the bill and hits the mark every time and do not take any notice of all those critics who moan it is a totally mindless film, well I totally disagree as it was a fantastic shoot-em-up action film that hits all the right buttons. Highly Recommended!

Not what everyones thinking i suppose but good natural action flick. For what the agent was i think they did a fairly good job keeping it within the realm of reality for the movie based on the enhancements. Overall i said give it a watch if you want to have some good action in you like for about an hour and 30 minutes.",1454803200,,481,4.127659574468085

7382446,5,B0142WELF6,"Hit man Agent 47 is a 2015 action thriller sequel film based on the award winning video game hitman series about a genetically engineered assassin Rupert Friend known as agent 47 the last 2 digits barcode tattooed on the back of his neck is a super soldier created by a Russian scientist  Litvenko Ciaran Hinds who disappeared before the projects completion leaving behind his daughter Katia Hanna Ware who's been trying to find her father , 47 works for International Contracts Agency who has been looking for Katia as a means to find her father before another deadly assassin Zachary Quinto Mr Spock from Star treck  alias John Smith who works for Rolf Kanies who has been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the super agent programme again for his own means with awesome action stunts .

I haven't seen o played the original  Hitman video game series and read negative comments about this movie that is nothing like the original  game ok fine each to their own and in my opinion the movie isn't bad at all if anything is awesome with excellent action stunts , fighting sequences special affects and shoot outs  with a great picture and sound , As good as the first one and the only let down to some Rupert Friend plays the part of Agent 47 instead of Timothy Olyphant who starred on the first one however Rupert Friend plays the part well  : good enough for me , looking forward to the next Hitman .",1454803200,,1411,4.531496062992126
7382447,2,B0142WELF6,"This movie was a bit of a slog to get through for me. I've been an avid fan of the Hitman video game series for years now and it feels like the director and the producers of this movie either took their entire understanding of Agent 47 from the back of the game boxes or the studio massively interfered with the movie and decided ""Hey, people don't want a boring spy movie- add more brutal murders and crazy stunts!""

And because of this, most of the movie feels like the antithesis of how I always perceived Agent 47, or at least how i always played him. Instead of being a tight, tense thriller, with Agent 47 narrowly escaping the enemy and assassinating a single target (or multiple targets, depending on the contract, but generally only killing his targets and nobody else) before seemingly disappearing into thin air, It decided to give Agent 47 some strange kind of Gunkata and instead of relying or stealth, have him walk straight into a conflict, guns blazing (or using whatever isn't nailed to murder everyone in the nearby vicinity).

If you're just needing a dumb action movie to pass the time, this is okay. However, if you're a fan of the Hitman game series... well... here's to hoping maybe the third reboot they do is closer to the source material.

One nice thing though: they remembered the rubber ducky.",1454716800,7,1322,4.617021276595745

7382518,3,B0142WELF6,"This reminds one of a blade runner with no soul. but somehow we don't care about the connection between brother or sister and their father.  The lack of emotional connection with the main protagonists leaves us empty. Only Rupert's ""Bond like"" ass kicking and accompanying spy genre music makes it worth watching. The opening ten minutes makes it worth watching as does the last ten but the bulk of it was forgettable. not sure why Rupert didn't go with his native British accent. it would have been a good audition for a future Bond role.",1454371200,,539,4.673684210526316

7382547,4,B0142WELF6,"After seeing the bad reviews panning this sequel or reboot of sorts of this movie, I almost decided not to watch but I felt that way about the original Hitman movie and discovered I liked it more than I thought I would.  In this case with Agent 47, I found myself entertained with the action in the movie but with mixed feelings overall and I really had a hard time determining how I would rate it.  This movie has definitely plenty of action and fight sequences and the special effects are also good.  I really had a hard time with Rupert Friend as the Agent 47.  He does a fine job in the role but I think I like Olyphant in the role in the 2007 movie a bit better.  The story was a bit basic and not as good as it could have been and ends up being very predictable but for a pure well-paced action movie, this was entertaining to watch.

7382601,3,B0142WELF6,I really enjoyed the 2007 film Hitman starring Tim Oliphant and Olga Kurylenko. I know the critics panned it but what do they know. The critics apparently panned Hitman Agent 47 too. I'd say they had a point. The new film didn't feature as many of the subtle visual clues from the games and lacked the humour of the earlier film. The action sequences were okay but not enough to rescue the film.  If you're a fan of the game I thought the 2007 film better captured the spirit and atmosphere. The newer film can be left on the shelf.,1453766400,,532,4.32

For what it tried to accomplish, it succeeded.  And I actually cared about the main characters.  As the end credits rolled, I had a pleasant smile on my face.  Good action, even some good dialogue moments.  Far above the usual mindless action flicks,  You get what you expect, and it's delivered in a nice package.",1453593600,,465,4.585365853658536

I much preferred the first one maybe because I played the game and it more closely related to the game and I was just surprised it was that good as most movies based off games seem to suck pretty bad.
So I would rent and not buy and just turn your brain off and enjoy some fancy shootem up. I do like the actor who plays agent 47 it was just a weak story and a bit over the top.",1453593600,5,500,3.8173076923076925

The movie had a lot of fun action, worth re-watching.  Innovative kills.  Daring escapes.

The acting was excellent.  I enjoyed the story until the end.  You even get a bit unsure of who to trust, which is fun.

Really nothing to complain about here.  If you are looking for a solid action film, without the cheesy over-the-top Hollywood writing, Agent 47 is your movie.  It's a stylish, well-filmed movie about super-human assassins you will not want to miss.",1453161600,20,656,4.758928571428571

Also, what of the other agents from 1 to 90, and where are they now. Plus, how many of the other syndicate agents are left after this last fight. It would be good if the siblings learn more about their past (syndicate may have files they haven't seen). Many missing stories left unanswered. Overall, the acting in this movie was done well. I prefer a bit more story and increased agent brilliance.

7382790,4,B0142WELF6,I have played the video games and I fully understand the interpretations of making movies out of their concept but like the first movie this is no where close to the game in the way of stealth.

I really loved the scene where a 50cal round only splinters the interrogation room glass. This is because the scene immediately after shows a man hurling himself through the same glass effortlessly. The first scene was probably more realistic, would have been better to just choose one. Gotta love FBI agents missing every shot, that never gets old.

But a believable one, based in the mythology they've created, and not just out of thin air. I liked the first Hitman movie, and this one is NOT a continuation of that one.

Well in this sequel and I thought it was okay and I did like Rupert Friend as the mew Hitman and I liked the story and all of the supporting characters too. So why only 3 stars? It is Hitman not Hitwoman....I am not being sexist I promise you, I just think that if you want to do this take it into that direction entirely, don't call it Hitman and have him be the second fiddle. I may be old fashioned but if you wanted to make the Hitman a woman that should have been the movie you made. I had the same problem with Mad Max Fury Road....that should have been angry Furiosa.

The comic covers what happens AFTER the movie ends, as well as providing a little bit of the story BEFORE the movie begins.

I plan to watch this again real soon with the ""Hit"" counter on, just to see how high a body count Agent 47 dishes out.  I liked the first Hitman movie and might like this one a little more.  Looking forward to a sequel to Agent 47.",1452038400,,528,4.23

Timothy Olyphant seemed like he actually did the stunts in Hitman 1, in real time, in a real universe, dealing with a real problem, with real Villains, and takes place in Multiple locations where he was being chased and did more than just a car thing. In 47 wasn't quite sure who the Villain was.

So I am not sure where I could rate this, like it would get a 4 star just because it Is a Hitman movie.  It had a good premise, a good plot, but it was too CG and too out of this world, like where do these guys go on their day off?  They must all be wanted by the local authorities as they are always shooting up things in the middle of the street, Which Timothy Olyphant did Not do in the first one.

I didn't have that here. If the movie were shot like John Wick, it was have been a different review. This is my opinion but Mark Strong would have been a much better agent 47.

7382842,5,B0142WELF6,"PLOT...
HITMAN: AGENT 47 centres on an elite assassin who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is equipped with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.

I look at this as a re-boot of the franchise based on the video game series as appose to a sequel, the movie has a pretty basic easy to follow story that plays out well with plenty of good action, the action is pretty well paced out through the movie and usual its violent shoot-outs and cool car chases and explosions! The cast is good, Rupert Friend does a good job of playing the lead cold killer agent 47, the movie has a cool soundtrack to accompany the action, the effects are all pretty well done when needed, overall its a very exciting fun filled thrill ride from beginning to end and action junkies should lap it up!

7382844,3,B0142WELF6,"When will the fascination and obsession with killing stop? It is in the television series, games children play, and movies. Assassins and hitmen/women are the toast of the town, and if that is you cup of tea you will love this movie.

Written by Skip Woods and Michael Finch, HITMAN: AGENT 47 as directed by Alexsander Bach centers on an elite assassin (Rupert Friend) who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman Katia (Hannah Ware) who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe (Zachary Quinto) in an attempt to find Katias father (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds).

Rupert Friend, still appealing as a leading man with a shaved head, fills the role well and the cinematography of all the impossible special effects is impressive. The ending is a bit on the sappy side  but maybe that will be altered for the next episode (which by public demand for this ilk will likely come soon).

Agent 47 (Friend) is the most advanced result but someone wants to improve upon him. His mission is to stop anyone from finding the formula, at any cost. I have to start by saying I was not a fan of the original Hitman movie and was a little hesitant about watching this one. I will admit that this one was better then the old one. On the other hand the story wasn't all that exciting and when the action wasn't happening it started to drag a little. The action was really exciting and inventive in some areas and the movie is worth watching for that but it just needed less time in between the excitement to keep it moving. Overall, better then the first one but still doesn't hit the same excitement as the video game series does. Much like the Fantastic Four series this is one franchise that they just can't seem to get right. I give it a C+.",1450915200,2,973,4.3812154696132595

7382869,3,B0142WELF6,"A woman searches for her father who abandoned her when she was a young girl. She joins forces with an assassin who saves her from another assassin. Now she has to figure out which assassin to trust while we, on the other hand, have to figure out if we care.

Directed by Aleksander Bach (""Stars"") and based on a screenplay by Skip Woods (""Hitman"" 2007) and Michael Finch (""The November Man""), this R-rated actioner takes place in sterile hi-tech surroundings and offers a complex arms-length plot which is neither involving nor entertaining. Knowing it was inspired by a video game makes this much more under-standable.

The award-winning cast:
  *  Hannah Ware (""Betrayal"") Katia van Dees is our heroine, frantic to find her scientist father before she is assassinated. She is confused and unhappy.
  * Zachary Quinto (""Star Trek"" he's the new Spock) John Smith is the assassin who saves our heroine from the assassin. He has been equipped with subcutaneous body armor (our screening audience snickered) and is virtually indestructible.
  * Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") Agent 47 is an assassin who has known our heroine all her life; he saves her from that other assassin. He is ambidextrous, so he fires guns with both hands simultaneously.
  * Ciarn Hinds (""Rome"") is her father, the scientist who developed these semi-robotic creations who could become a formidable army if his technology fell into the wrong hands,.

By actual count, there are six (6!) ""Hitman"" movies so far, but the one who inspired this sequel is the 2007 version with Timothy Olyphant. We aren't sure if even the appealing presence of Mr. O. could have saved this one. Probably not.... Screenwriters take delight in inventing newer, more gruesome instruments of torture. I do NOT take delight from them.

Please note, I said ""award-winning cast"" and it's true: Every actor in this cast has done far better work in far better projects. This is an R-rated waste of time buried in lots of Computer Generated Imaging, gunfire, fisticuffs, vehicular mayhem and blowie uppie stuff, with surprisingly little profanity and no sweaty bodies. I doubt if you'll care whether or not this has a happy ending.",1443139200,,2169,4.991666666666666
