8565830,3,B00BC3QFRQ,"I love the idea that this movie was made.  I realize that it was funded by the Fountain family, which explains the overt one-sided telling of the story.  Plus, there are some artistic liberties with the facts.  I thought the actors were outstanding & deserve many kudos.  I am from the Gililland side of the story, so I have a bit different perspective about the events.  At any rate, the disappearance of the Fountains is a long time mystery and very famous.  I just had a difficult time watching it with objectivity.",1386115200,2,518,4.576086956521739
8565831,3,B00BC3QFRQ,"The story was good and, being from Las Cruces, NM, I know a little about the story.  I guess I wish it were a little longer and more detailed.  I have the book about murder on the white sands (think that's what it's called), and hoped the video would be more in depth, like the book.
I think the actors did a good job and basically, it was worth watching.",1371859200,2,355,4.057142857142857
8565832,5,B00BC3QFRQ,"I must say that I was totally taken by surprise by the 43 minute short!  The acting was professional and never overplayed for this true story account of on the country's greatest unsolved western mysteries.

The cinematography was excellent and the sound was superb to say the least.  I watched it through my 5.1 surround-sound system and the care and uniqueness taken in this short was better than some big Hollywood flicks.

I would suggest that if you watch this film you need to know that the story line jumps back and forth in time.  I appreciated the subtitles telling when in time each jump back or forth was...that helped me follow it.

One thing I can say is that this short film left me wanting more!",1366588800,3,710,4.551181102362205
