3969101,1,B002QZDSW4,"What a complete rip off. This so called Season 3 is actually the second half of the Second season. A terrible end to an awesome show.
It came out in Australia weeks ago, long before the release date of the USA. So, i didn't find out about this till it was in the dvd player.
And the so called never seen before features are exactly the same as my copy of season 2, (which is a US copy). Even the front cover is the same. Just a different colour. Boooooo. Now they've realized they were on a good thing with the show, now they will milk it for all its worth.

3969105,5,B002QZDSW4,"TV fans frequently castigate FOX for the long string of premature cancellations of potentially (or actually) great shows over the past fifteen years. They have built up a great deal of ill will with fans, with many people refusing to give FOX series tries because of a lack of confidence that they will stick with the shows. The damage done to FOX by their quick trigger finger is difficult to calculate. Until recently, I was loathe to watch any show on the network, so intense was my anger at them. Thankfully, things seem to have changed somewhat. New FOX head of programming Kevin Reilly -- who built a reputation at NBC for his patience with critically acclaimed shows with weak ratings, shows like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, 30 ROCK, and THE OFFICE -- seems to have brought a similar patience with him. While shows like the marvelous TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have been cancelled, he can't be accused of any silly cancellations that we saw with he predecessors.

But just as things have been improving at FOX, so things have been worsening at ABC. In fact, ABC seems to be determined to become the new FOX. The most shocking cancellation was unquestionably PUSHING DAISIES, which was not only one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, but led all shows for most nominations at the 2008 Emmys. They cancelled at the same time the delightful ELI STONE and later managed to cancel a substantial portion of its entire schedule. Now ABC Family has joined the party, cancelling network mainstay KYLE XY.

KYLE XY was not one of the best shows on TV. The writing was not as sharp as it could have been and the overall story arc seemed to drift at times. Nonetheless, KYLE XY was for three years a series I watched with ongoing interest and enjoyment. I loved the Trager family and was increasingly enjoying the surprising love triangle between Kyle, Amanda, and Jesse. I've also had an ongoing interest in shows featuring technologically altered people, such as Max in DARK ANGEL (a character Kyle resembles in some ways) or Jake in JAKE 2.0 or River Tam in FIREFLY.

I didn't care for Jesse much in Season 2, but I not only came to like her character in the current season, but actually enjoyed the complexity of the surprising love triangle that resulted as Kyle came to recognize her romantically. I have no idea how that would have ended, but it would have been delightful to find out. Another romance on the show seemed more likely to remain ended, as Joss's girlfriend Andy moved with her mothers to Cleveland. Magda Apanowicz, who played Andy, got a role on the BSG prequel CAPRICA, a much higher profile series. But the whole question of Amanda versus Jesse was left completely in the air.

I think all the television networks should commit themselves to a pact with their audiences. Over the years dozens and dozens of shows have been cancelled in midstory. When most shows were episodic rather than serial in format, this didn't matter. But virtually all shows worth watching -- and all of the shows I watch, without exception -- are serials. They tell an ongoing story. PUSHING DAISIES will end (as of this date the final three episodes have not been broadcast) with a host of story arcs dangling. The same is true of ELI STONE and KYLE XY. I think television would improve, ratings would improve, and attitudes towards networks would improve if all the networks would vow to allow all television series to have a proper conclusion. This could be done either by allowing a series an extra 2 or 3 episodes to wrap up the story or a mini-series or made for TV movie (or even a direct-to-TV movie) to do the same. As it is, I have immense anger towards FOX (though that has been dissipating somewhat the past couple of years) and a growing anger at ABC and ABC Family for scores of irritating cancellations. Let the series finish what they started!!!! In addition to all the other advantages, it would increase DVD sales. One of the reasons why WONDERFALLS is so satisfying on DVD is that while it was cancelled by FOX after four episodes, 13 were filmed and appear on DVD, the final episode providing a very satisfying ending to the short series. Right now when networks cancel a series, they just leave things in a mess.

But I also think that executive producers need to stop ending each season with a big cliffhanger. If you know a show is safe and that it has been renewed, a cliffhanger is not irresponsible. But I think it is stupid to write a cliffhanger for a show that is on the fence or in signficant danger of cancellation. I loved VERONICA MARS, but Rob Thomas knew the show was at risk of ending. He should have ended the show with something that could have served as a series ender in case it was cancelled. There is an important precedent for what I am suggesting. Even though BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was able to end on its own terms, Joss Whedon felt that there was always a possibility of cancellation. So each season of BUFFY (and most seasons of ANGEL) end in a way so that it could have stood as a series finale.

Still, when networks cancel shows after work on the current season has ended, then they ought to allow some sort of ending. This is certainly the case with KYLE XY. There was simply no opportunity for the writers to provide anything like a series ending. At the very least ABC Family should have ordered three more episodes with the understanding that they would be the last.

I hope that whoever does the hiring and firing replaces the programming people at ABC and ABC Family. It isn't just that the networks have a string of bad shows; they are cancelling the best shows simply because the ratings are weak. If you have a critically acclaimed show, you always have the potential to build an audience. But if you replace it with crap, you have neither critical acclaim nor potential. As things stand, once LOST is finished, I may be finished with ABC as well, with the lone caveat that I'm anxious to see what they do with the pilot that they are developing for FABLES, based on the extraordinary comics by Bill Willingham. But apart from that, ABC has become the network from which I have the least expectations.",1255132800,119,6174,4.607272727272727

3969110,5,B002QZDSW4,Kyle XY was such a fantastic show. It ended too soon with only 3 seasons but they wrapped it up well with an ending that could also lead to the show being picked up again but it never was. So many great and unique shows canceled before their time. Buy all 3 seasons for good clean family TV with great morals and family values. A fun show I always looked forward to seeing each week on ABC Family. Its just as enjoyable watching it over and over. I never tire of it.,1447459200,2,466,4.076086956521739

3969123,4,B002QZDSW4,"If you count the break in season 2 to make Season 2, 2 separate seasons, then it would only be appropriate to say that yes, Kyle XY did end up having 4 complete seasons- and I feel it would been very much appreciated by the fans and execs of the show alike, if it had had one more season to have completely wrapped up the show. Season 3 was such a PHENOMINAL season in its own right- With the introduction of Michael Cassidy and characters like Jackie and Nate and the introduction of Latnock. (One of the things I was really looking forward to finding out in S4 that was never explained, hence the cancellation, was why Nate had stolen Sarah's ring from Cassidy) Personally, after watching the season premiere, I was hoping for a Jessi/Cassidy hookup like you wouldn't believe, and was SO disappointed that we didn't get it :( - No, Jessi just had to go and fall for Kyle. Sorry but I cant STAND Kessi romantically. I like them being friends/partners in figuring out their past and stuff but don't appreciate anything beyond that. I can stand Kyle/Amanda a tich but am not sure that I ever really truly shipped them either. One couple I DID however ship from the get-go, and was literally cheering for them when S3 aired, was Lori/Mark. I was ESTATIC in 3x04 The Company of Men when they hooked up in Jessi's apartment. That's one thing that I would have loved to have seen if there had been a Season 4- more interaction w the characters, in Jessi and Cassidy's apartment building. I really believe the writers could have had a blast writing storylines with this premise. I can think of a few off the top of my head right now :) - On another note, in Fanfics, I ended up falling for Jessi/Nate. Fans make them so promising in fanfics its hard to believe how they are with one another on the show- I would have loved to see where their 'situation' (? not sure what else to call it, am not about to call them Friends, cause they aren't even that) - would have gone. Never got quite into Nate/Amanda- give me Jessi w Nate any day! :) - Anyways, like I stated, this show should have had at LEAST one more season- ABC Family really needs to figure out what they're doing w their programing cause no one I know watches the channel anymore- I know I don't. They choose to end fantastic shows too early like WildFire and here, Kyle XY - in favor for shows like TSLOTAT and PLL, neither of which I can barely stand. I guess the only way to know what could have really happened for Season 4, the final season of Kyle XY, isn't to watch this DVD to get answers but to read fanfics on FanFiction.net- I'm telling you right now, some of the fanfics on there are way better than the answers we have been given on this DVD Set for a satisfying conclusion. And that's pretty pathetic. ABC Family really needs to get it together w GOOD Programming!",1421452800,,2832,4.365530303030303

3969156,5,B002QZDSW4,"I loved every episode, except the last one, of this series and re-watch it over and over. It seems to me that any actually interesting and thought provoking material on television is quickly and firmly removed from the air. I don't know if the responsible parties are actually mentally defective, or if they just don't like it because the viewing audience does. Maybe this is why I haven't owned a television for so long. I just don't see the sense in paying someone to watch commercials just barely glued together with pablum. Aren't you glad I'm not opinionated?  :-)))))

High-end science fiction, well plotted and edited. We watch a young man, totally ignorant of the mores, morals and culture suddenly surrounding him. He is strong enough - sane enough to withstand the barrage of new and strange sensations, interactions, and other stimuli that would probably destroy most of us. His interactions with the outside world and the people who inhabit it have strong elements of the surreal, while his ability to adapt gives thought to our own reactions to the new and different. Thought provoking, enticing, this is well written and enjoyable. Provides exposure to a constant string of philosophical concepts, events and dilemmas while not being preachy or confusing. Rather, this is always interesting and enjoyable to watch, even if it does make you actually think a bit. I think this is great material. I tend to get all paranoid when trying to figure out why the powers that be continually remove material such as this from our purview. Are we mindless idiots to be fed mindless media to keep us ""in our place"". I don't know, but the removal of programming such as this truly makes me wonder...

Today I watched the last disc and I'm grieving knowing that there won't be a conclusion.  What kind of cruelty is that?  What kind of management at ABC Family is allowed to do that? It's not o.k.  One can only hope that the individuals at ABC Family Management treat their own family with more regards then they treat their viewers.

My gf started watching the show on season 3 and was litterly crying near the end of season three because of the love story with Kyle and Jessi...I was really looking forward to more episodes especially after the cliffhanger ending, only to see that there were no more episodes on netflix....I was seriously pissed and I usually don't care when a show ends but this show had something different about it then any other teen drama ABC Family currently has.

Netflix is recently adding new episodes of previously cancelled TV shows like arrested development and there looking into adding a season 2 of terra nova and the river....

I suggest all the fans of Kyle XY email, write netflix to create a season 4 for this show... Maybe they can buy the rights and give us another season, so we can have closure...",1338940800,2,980,4.531073446327683

3969169,3,B002QZDSW4,"The third season of Kyle XY followed a strong second season, which probably made season three look even weaker by comparison.
Unlike season two, season three has a relatively weak antagonist and a confused point of view. The organization that Kyle does battle with does not seem to have any rational goal, nor does it have any sensible method of achieving the goals that the writers lay out for it.
Too much of what happens in the season is based on poor character choices and plot driven stupidity for one to care much about what is going on in the show; and the action is clearly driven by the writers dragging the characters around, rather than the characters acting out of their own established beliefs and personalities.
Don't get me wrong, the third season still has some good stuff in it, I just wish that it would have been better.
Also, I suggest that you avoid the interview with the Kyle XY producers concerning what they had planned for season four, had it gone forward, I suspect that you will be almost as outraged as I am.",1334016000,,1037,4.550802139037433

This series is not just about Kyle and science fiction but it also covers all aspects of teenage, youth and adultery in its best means.

3969178,5,B002QZDSW4,"Kyle XY is absolutely the best TV series ever for family to watch together.  Not only does it have clever and witty lines, the innocence of romantic relationships, and suspenseful sci-fi plots that are scientifically plausible... it also presents many realistic problems or issues that parents and teenagers face in their everyday relationships. It gives good thought provoking lessons/ morals / decision-making choices that family members can utilize for debates and talking points... a great educational and parenting tool!  I believe the drop in viewers have nothing to do with the plot and storylines.... but I think ABC Family did not advertise or market the show properly, and the Title  ""Kyle XY"" does not catch interest for viewers who did not know about the show, like myself.  I did not know anything about this show (which apparently started in 2006) until I accidentally came across it as I browse thru Netflix instant streaming ... this year 2011!  PLEASE bring the show back or at least make a DVD or movie finale to fill in the cliff hangers and help Kyle somehow utilizes his innate gifts to touch humanity and convince the Latnok scientists to abandon their one-track mind and unethical pursuit of cloning and turn them towards some other scientific advancements for humanity, or destroy the Latnok organization if those scientists are too stubborn ....then make sequels of Kyle (give it a different Title please) being some form of super hero fighting agianst ""mad scientists"" as the villains ... ( just like the way Batman, Spiderman or Superman sequels were so successful). Our family members are craving to have more Kyle time !  I still enjoy re-watching the series over and over because there are so many thought-provoking moments with many of the episodes.

The actors and actresses were very good in their roles, especially Matt Dallas (Kyle) and (Josh) and others. The expressions and emotions depicted by such young artists are exceptional and impressive. It is definitely better and has more substance than ""Scrubs"", yet ""Scrubs"" survived so many seasons. Kyle XY is way better than any of the shows that ABC Family had replaced it with in 2009, 2010...  There are hundreds of emails and comments online sites, netflix , hulu etc. that requested for ABC Family to bring back Kyle XY.  It may be hard to bring the entire cast back to look as young as they did 2-3 years ago, BUT the writers and producers should be able to work out those kinks!!!!",1314057600,4,2474,4.913669064748201

3969181,4,B002QZDSW4,"We get a fighting action sequence-it's about time!-but the truth is they were battling against people so inferior to them that it wasn't much of a fight. How great would it be to find there were more of these pod people like Kyle and Jessie so we can get a real hand to hand?

I absolutely LOVE Andy and Josh. They're the best relationship out there. Well, I guess mostly I don't like that Kyle and Amanda, though perfect for each other, are kind of personality-less. (And why is it he can tell everyone else his secret but not Amanda who would accept anything with him?) And Declan is way too good for Lori (though I wish he'd actually explained why he broke up with her beyond ""I'm Kyle's secret keeper""). So Andy and Josh are perfect, both with personalities and super cute together.

Then there's Lori's new love interest. I don't want to ruin anything here, so all I have to say is: great job writers. Perhaps one of the best bits of writing they've done yet. And everything that I know about him (getting into Season 3 Episode 2) is intriguing to say the least.

I'm bothered by the whole Hilary-Lori friendship. They basically ignore the fact that Hilary iced Lori at school-which is not fighting it's brutal bullying. And Lori just forgave her. Something like that shouldn't go unaddressed as it sends the message that it's not such a big deal to do that to someone.

I like that the show is once again delving into the secrets of Kyle (and Jessie). Quire frankly, Jessie is the far more interesting of the two, with personality quirks, issues, and perhaps a bit of craziness. It's unfortunate that Kyle is super oblivious to her to the point where he is kind of negligent of her. (Yes, she's overly obsessed with him and does stupid things, but he had someone to guide him in everything that she didn't and she's clearly in need of his help but he never notices.) And what was that comment the psychic made about her? I am so not interested in Kyle and Jessie becoming a super couple or anything like that though.

Gag me with a Tyranasaurus Rex, it was like being on my second honeymoon and having my husband say, ""I'm done, you can finish it up from here"". (!!@?#)

They should at least have one two hour long ""movie"", but if all they are going to do is put Jessi and Kyle together I'm not excited at all. Amanda and Kyle were the perfect innocent couple, aside from his ignorance on how to stack his priorities in personal and family relationships. And ""mom"" on the other hand, instead of teaching him this matter, is all wound up in 'gay rights'.
As a psychologist #1, she is NOT ALLOWED by law to interject suggestions on how she thinks people should run their lives morally, that is a legal taboo. She is only allowed to build on the person's own moral structure (Christian, Jew etc.), allowing them to make up their own mind. It is wrong and misleading to portray her profession the way it was.

#2, she should be teaching moral and relationship/responsibility priorities. This is something all people should learn while they are young, instead of always choosing based on their current feelings with no commitment of any sort. You don't get married one day and run off and sleep with your secretary the next, and come back home again. He experienced this the wrong way enough times that if MOM really WAS a psych, she should have jumped in right away and let him know ""Houston, we have a problem"".

3969203,4,B002QZDSW4,"What a difference a year makes!

""Kyle XY"" has been the flagship series for abc family as it was the top rated series for the cable channel from 2006-2008.  After raving about season two of abc Family's sci-fi teen drama series ""Kyle XY"" and how I enjoyed the series immensely, the highly anticipated third season was canceled and to make things worse, there was no appropriate ending to the series as it ended with a cliffhanger.  The final episode was meant to be a season finale not a series finale.

Needless to say, fans were upset that the networks didn't give the executive producers/writers an opportunity to give the series some closure.  With fans hoping an online petition would bring it back online, unfortunately the series has been canceled and for fans, all that they can hope for is some closure with the DVD release of the third and final season.  Fortunately, the executive producers do give closure through ""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" DVD release.

""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" features the final ten episodes on three DVD's.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. There are a lot of outdoor and indoor shots in this series, so the series definitely benefits from the outdoor shots.  Picture quality on DVD is satisfactory compared to other television series on DVD with some compression and also a fine layer of grain can be seen on video.  But for the most part, PQ for this television series is good.

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-driven and audio is mainly coming from the center and front channel speakers.  Dialogue is clear and understandable as with the music for the film.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Kyle XY: The Complete Third Season - Final Season"" comes with the following special features:

Disc 2:

  * Audio commentary for ""Episode 38 - Life Support"" - Optional audio commentary by executive producers David Himelfarb and Eric Tuchman.

Disc 3:

  * Kyle XY: Future Revealed - (12:34) For those who wanted to know how ""Kyle XY"" should have ended, this is the special feature to watch.  Executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb and co-executive producer Julie Flec talk about how ""Kyle XY"" was supposed to end if given a fourth season.
  * Deleted Scenes - Featuring twelve deleted scenes with optional commentary by Executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb.
  * Audio commentary for ""Episode 43 - Bringing Down the House"" - Optional audio commentary by executive producer David Himelfarb and co-executive producer Julie Flec.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that after the series finale, I was shocked about how the final season ended.  What was up with the cliffhanger?  Why didn't the writers end the series.  And this DVD release explains that the third season was done and was setup for a fourth season but it didn't happen that way, ABC canceled the series.

So, it does makes sense why the series ended with a cliffhanger and after hearing how the executive producers wanted to end the series, how disappointing that this series could not have been continued.  I was at least hoping the series would be picked up by another cable network and somehow the series would continue to go on.  After all, for three years, this series was the top rated show for abc family.

So, in a way, this final season is kind of bittersweet because it doesn't give you the feeling of closure.  But at least, the executive producers were able to give us a glimpse of what they wanted through the special feature and also with the audio commentary for the final episode.

I really enjoyed ""Kyle XY"" and its rather unfortunate that such a wonderful series had to end with a cancellation and also unfortunate that the network couldn't give them additional episodes to wrap the series up.  May it be through two hour movie or an additional 3-4 episodes, those millions of viewers who enjoyed the series should have been treated with some closure.

As for the DVD release, the second season was a fantastic release with many special features with the cast, many audio commentary tracks but surprisingly, the third and final season only had audio commentary for two episodes and the deleted scenes.  So, I was a little surprised how this final DVD release had less content.

Nevertheless, I'm grateful to executive producers Eric Tuchman and David Himelfarb and co-executive Julie Flec for being so honest with their fans through this DVD release and explaining of what they wanted for the future of ""Kyle XY"" and also talking about the series cancellation.

So, if you are a big fan of ""Kyle XY"" and own the previous two seasons, this is the final season to complete your collection and possibly the way to gain closure for those who enjoyed the series.",1262563200,,4869,4.8272946859903385

I had no idea how the story ended, or more precisely how it didn't end. What a major disappointment! Despite this, I felt the writing was the best of all 3 seasons specially the relationship between Kyle and Jesse.",1261958400,9,335,4.419354838709677
3969206,5,B002QZDSW4,"Season three was AMAZING! Deff. recomm it to everyone.

However, this utterly FANTASTIC show was cancelled by the idiots running ABC. Why did they cancel it when Kyle's numbers where higher than 'Greek' & that other show abou the police officer?!

Then it took two CANCELLED shows (after abut 2-3 eps) to replace kyle... and now two stupid shows to replace those.

Honestly, you can see just how amazing this show was if they had to replace it not only with one show but with two usless ones!

I have no idea what lead them to cancel it, since kyle did give them their big break and brought in all the numbers in the beginning. They just got too greedy and didn't want to spend money promoting the other seasons (esp season 3) and expected the fans to spread the word, which we did, but we need to be back-ed up.

But no, they instead spend ALL of their profits promoting a stupid show about teen pregnancy.",1261785600,5,907,4.407185628742515
3969207,4,B002QZDSW4,"I discovered Kyle XY via Hulu recommendation and from the pilot episode, I was hooked. Kyle XY is a love first, sci-fi second series. And by love, I mean all facets of it from familial and neighborly love to romantic love. It delivered well-balanced messages of respect and caring without being preachy. The sci-fi element that was woven into the story added a touch of excitement and kept the viewer on edge. It reminded me of Dawson's Creek meets Seventh Heaven meets Smallville. It wasn't perfect, but I soaked in every episode and after the shocking season three conclusion, I needed to know what happened.

Although I'd already seen all the episodes in the third season, I got the DVDs because I read in a producer's interview that there would be a special bonus feature wrapping up the show's loose ends. One hour long show meant to wrap up everything wouldn't be what I'd hoped for, but it would be better than nothing. Right? Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

The season three DVD set includes 3 discs with each episode from the final season. The third disc also has some bonus features. One of the features is ""Kyle XY: Future Revealed."" As I anxiously awaited the final world-altering episode, my hopes were dashed when it turned out to be a fifteen minute interview with the producers explaining how the story's various threads would have been tied up had the show continued for another season. In fact, all the information they shared was already provided through various written and video interviews posted online and broadcast on TV. Basically, we're told what would have happened, with a few episodic clips thrown in for good measure, but it's still rather unsatisfying.

Also on the DVD are some deleted scenes spanning a few seconds to a couple of minutes each and don't get fooled by the ""Sneak Peeks""--they are previews for upcoming programs and not sneak peeks for any future episodes of Kyle XY.

It would be lovely if the writers and producers could collaborate on a book which wraps up the Kyle XY storyline or even a full-length made for TV conclusion to the series, but I'm not holding my breath. To sum up, if you're looking for closure to the Kyle XY series, you probably won't get it on these DVDs.",1261612800,118,2230,4.724935732647815
3969208,5,B002QZDSW4,"Kyle XY is one of my favourite sci-fi shows ever. To me I rate it on par with the Highlander series with Adrian Paul. As the series continued it got better and better until the ABC Family decided to cancel it due to what it said was not high enough ratings. What they did not understand was everyone I knew Tivoed the series to watch it later. Now I don't know if Tivo's are part of the Nielson ratings but it should be. Many people I know cannot watch shows during the week and wait until the weekend to watch the shows due to their busy lives.

ABC Family has been removed from my list of TV channels to watch due to the cancellation of this series. It was not fair not to end it after 3 seasons and taking a year off between screenings and expecting people to stop every thing to watch it.  When everyone Tivo's their shows.",1261180800,15,827,4.1625

8378166,1,B002QZDSW4,"I seldom write a review for videos but this one warrants a response.  The video was described as acceptable.  When it came the package looked okay but the case was pretty damaged. There were three discs and two of them were in good shape. But the third one had dozens of scratches, both circular and straight across the disc. For kicks I tried to load it. No way.  I took the disc down to my local video store and they said they would try to save it.  They took the maximum number of cuts they could off of it and while you could still see some scratches I was able to watch it.  This is a nice little SF series and I am glad I got to finish it.  But I will always wonder who in their right mind could possible have described this as being in acceptable condition.",1525824000,,764,4.093959731543624

That is why I rated it down one star, otherwise, 5 stars all the way.  This series had a chemistry about it that just worked.  It also had good values and morals to go along with the action and Kyle's emotional development.  All three seasons are worth owning.

8378174,5,B002QZDSW4,"This show was by far the most amazing show on television. I found it on Netflix and watched the whole series in less than a week's time. I was hooked from the start. I was then disappointed at the abrupt non ending of the show. Spoiler alert below..............
Kyle is holding the bad guy up lifting him in the air by his neck about to kill him. The bad guy
 Says ""you don't want to do that"" kyle says ""why not"" bad guy says ""because I am your brother"" then credits. No more to the story. Does he kill him does he hesitate and lose the fight do they talk about it. What happens? This was the worst ever place in any TV show to have a cancellation. Kyle was juts figuring out who he was and what the people who created him were up to and then it ends. Just like that. No warning. No conclusion no closure for the audience. This was the first ever series I couldn't keep my eyes away from. Now it's ruined because it didn't finish. I want it back I want more and there is no more. This upsets me on the upmost level of TV binging ever. At least it has been removed from Netflix so that no one else could be as disappointed as I was.",1462665600,,1131,4.026666666666666
