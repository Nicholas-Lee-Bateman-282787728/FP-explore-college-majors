7831500,4,6302728983,"This film covers an entire year of events for the Queen from late 1990 to late 1991.  If you follow the royal family you will recognize those in this film who are no longer with us (from Princess Diana, the Queen Mother, and Princess Margaret) and also gasp or giggle in amusement at how young all the Queen's grandchildren are (many if not most who are only little here are now married with young families!)  The priceless parts of this film are the on/off narration by the Queen herself (the closest to her opinions we are ever likely to hear directly from herself) and the conversations caught by very stealthy camera work by the director and crew (the Queen chatting with Ronald and Nancy Reagan on the yacht Britannia is a gem).  This is the second rarest documentary on the British royal family (the celebrated 1968 one has never been released on video or DVD and most likely never will).  It is sobering to realize that this film was released in February 1992 (the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession) and was just before the turmoil of the ""annus horribilis"".  The brilliance of this thorough documentary was quickly drowned out by the fire at Windsor and the acrimony of the failing marriages of the Queen's children.  Still, at twenty-two years old it is entertaining, full of anecdote worthy asides and conversations by the Queen and others, and a real inside look at the workings of the British monarch.",1395964800,,1421,4.709677419354839
