8455783,1,B0053V5XMG,"In fact I didn't get it. I ordered it twice, twice with the wrong item ""Karl May- Der Schatz im Silbersee-winnetou und das Halbblut Apanatschi-Winnetou snd sein Freund Old Firehand"" getting delivered. Agreed to keep it once, denied it a second time. Bad service.",1385510400,,262,4.9772727272727275
8455784,4,B0053V5XMG,"The movies are beautiful and well-done.  My mom is a big fan of the Karl May books and we enjoyed watching the movies together.  I bought her a Blu-ray player specifically so that we could watch these.  I am very disappointed that we can not get to the bonus material, like the interviews with the cast.  When you select that option, it momentarily seems like it's going to go somewhere, but then it redisplays the menu.  Extremely frustrating since it is advertised as being part of what you are paying for and shows on the menu.",1380240000,,530,4.479166666666667
8455785,4,B0053V5XMG,"Blue-Ray video quality is excellent and closely matches glorious scenery of the original movies, popular in Europe in the 1960s.  Sound is another matter.  Apparently, on some discs bits of english dialogue are missing and sometimes replaced by the german soundtrack (turning on english subtitles helps).  There doesn't seem to be additional material such as interviews or commentary.  Karl May's Winnetou story is simplistic, generally suitable for younger audiences (assuming that they can handle morality plays involving western style violence).  If that doesn't bother you, these discs are visually a joy to watch, and a reminder of movie experiences from half a century ago.",1372204800,,679,5.490384615384615
8455786,2,B0053V5XMG,english audio is mixed up with german. I'ts quite disturbing. You would expect to get good quality product for 50 dollars especially if it is advertised the movie has an english audio.,1360886400,5,184,4.78125
8455787,4,B0053V5XMG,"It's these wonderful Yugoslav (of course that country is all history now) locations and Martin Bttcher's musical score that make these Karl May films so iconic and set them apart from any other western, Hollywood or spaghetti! (director Harald Reinl even returned to Plitvice National Park for another shoot (""Die blutigen Geier von Alaska"", 1973; film: 3/10) failing to recreate the original magic though)

Film: 7/10
Picture quality: 8.5/10
Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (orig.)
Audio: D; GB
ST: D; GB o/-
RC: B (A;C?)
Bonus: Flip-covers; Making-ofs; Interviews (e.g. Harald Reinl, archive); unseen footage; text infos etc.
Studio: Tobis/Universum

All 3 Blu-rays look fairly good with very few exceptions (acc. to bonus-info for these shots no original film negatives were available; ca. 3-4 per movie). Colours (red, blue, yellow) are too vibrant at times, but maybe that's true to the original releases shown in cinemas?
