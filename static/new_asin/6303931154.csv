7856916,4,6303931154,"I totally and completely agree with the assessments on the quality of the video chosen for this tape -- it's grainy at times and in some parts of it there is an odd video border framing around the skaters.  So, why 4 stars instead of 1 or 2?  Well, it's because of the actual programs you get to see.  You get to see Christopher Bowman skate an amazing, artistic, brilliantly placed exhibition program.  Midori Ito skates a light and sweet show number that shows just a hint of the technical brilliance people would see months later at her history making win at 1989 Worlds.  And Tonya Harding's 80s hairstyle in this video alone make it worth the price. :)
If you became a fan of skating in the pre Tonya and Nancy days, back when figures were still in competition and The Battle of the Brians was a topic of discussion for weeks afterward, even with your non skating fan friends, this video is a great walk down memory lane, despite the poor quality.",996451200,8,952,4.448275862068965
7856917,4,6303931154,I have been into figure skating for years now and always try to catch anything I can find on TV. This video is loaded with some seriously good skating and Katarina was beautiful. The quality of the video and sound is very good.,987552000,7,227,4.3023255813953485
