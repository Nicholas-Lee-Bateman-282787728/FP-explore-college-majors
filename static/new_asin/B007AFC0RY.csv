5071637,4,B007AFC0RY,"Had a heck of a time finding this to view before buying -- eventually had to go through an inter-library loan!  Found out about it through a fav movie spoiler page, and am I glad.  Great visually -- stylish and crisp, believable special effects; even the slightly out-landish elevator to The Vault made me sympathetically uncomfortable.  Superb acting by Northam -- watched this with a friend who was used to seeing him in period dramas and she was stunned at his progression through the movie. The plot was disturbing and left me pondering afterwards. There are a few plot loops (honestly, there aren't many movies made without them), but there was enough continuity and layering to make me want to watch it again -- and buy it!  The pace at first might not appeal to all, but this is a thoughtful movie, and the level of action certainly switches gears later on. If you're tired of watching non-stop special-effect-laden violence or sci-fi, in the mood for an off-kilter paranoia/conspiracy flick with a sharp look, or just want something a little different from the run-of-the-mill, this movie is a prime choice.",1140134400,4,1115,4.852631578947369
5071638,3,B007AFC0RY,"Wouldn't it be sad if the high point of your career was ""Charlie's Angels""? That might turn out to be the case for Liu, if she keeps making movies like this.

Cypher is a passable spy/tech movie. An ordinary-looking guy is living some double life, hidden from his wife and even (we find out later) from himself. Liu, wearing a horrendous wig, drops in from nowhere (sometimes literally) bearing mysterious messages. They live happily ever after. And there was some running around in the middle.

The pieces are all good, but the movie never rises above the ordinary. It's one way to kill an evening, if you have one that really needs to die.

5071639,2,B007AFC0RY,"I've always enjoyed watching Jeremy Northam's work, whether in the sci fi classic MIMIC or the oh so proper GOSFORD PARK.  But not even the usually suave Northam can save CYPHER from being a cinematic mess.  It's premise of corporate espionage and it's mysterious underlying theme is initially intriguing and holds your interest, even though it's slow moving.  But as the movie throws twist upon twist and never really validates these twists, it becomes more of an incomplete jigsaw puzzle than a complete movie.  Lucy Liu struggles through a role that requires her to look seductive, but whose monotonous delivery negates any impact the actress could have.  Although stylishly done, CYPHER is one of those movies you should be glad you rented and didn't buy.",1126051200,4,759,5.04
5071640,4,B007AFC0RY,"Canadian director Vincenzo Natali made a cult film 'Cube' in 1997 -- claustrophobic thriller about six people trapped in cubic rooms.  In his new film, Natali made another thriller in the vein of 'The Manchurian Candidate.'  The difference from Sinatra's classic film is that 'Cypher' is more atmospheric, complicated, and politic-free.  You need a lot of suspention of disbelief, but the film is stylish and uniquely entertaining.

The story begins with a job interview of one Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) by a high-tech company Digicorp.  Morgan, mild-mannered and quite ordinary man, is accepted after many exams which apparently are intended to test not so much his skills as his identity, for the company is afraid of his being a spy sent from its rivals.

Now Morgan starts his new freelance job, given another name ""Jack Thursby.""  As Jack, Morgan is sent on a business trip to the cities, where a conference is held.  His assignment is simple -- to tape secretly the presentations there, and transmit the content.  His first mission is in shaving cream convention in Buffalo; next, process cheese in Omaha; and then, Boise....

YOU CAN SENSE that something is wrong with the world Morgan/Jack is in.  Things are managed too well.  Everyhing looks very artificial (see the designs of square buildings or town blocks).  And one red-haired woman named 'Rita Foster' (Lucy Liu) always shows up whereever Morgan goes.  What is her purpose?

Though the story gets confusing in the second half, 'Cypher' remains intriguing, refusing to give us an easy wayout from the maze until the last moment.  Some may think the ending is slightly disappointing, but even they would admit the film's unpredictable storyline.  As to the acting, Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu are both very good.  Northam seamlessly changes one personality to another while Liu shows her more quiet side unlike her hit movies 'Charle's Angels' or 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.'

Final words about the release of the film.  The film was completed in 2002, and soon was released in January 2003 in Japan (where I watched this film in theater when it was renamed 'Company Man' -- better title, I guess), and much later the same year in UK, too.  But for some reasons I don't know, Miramax refused to release it in America until 2005.  'Cypher' is another example of casualities from unaccountable decision, which I hope will not happen in the future.  The film deserves a much better fate.",1124582400,17,2446,4.9411764705882355
5071641,5,B007AFC0RY,"I'm not that great of a sci-fi fan so was a bit wary of Cypher, but it's really quite brilliant.  More in the vein of Hitchcock in terms of wondering where reality starts and ends, and with a distinctly convoluted plot, Cypher keeps you engaged & keeps you guessing.  Well acted, well written, and with a ""Blade Runner"" visual style.  Don't miss it.",1124236800,14,349,4.507936507936508
5071642,4,B007AFC0RY,"As low-budget sci-fi movies go, this one is pretty damn good! Sure, if you think too much about it afterwards, there are flaws to be found, plot-wise. But...  if you appreciate a good brain-twisting-thriller-sci-fi with a light touch of dark comedy, some very cool cinemnatic 'moments' and a quick pace, this is some good, yummy stuff!

5071643,5,B007AFC0RY,"This is a great film.  When I think sci-fi, I usually think of the popular space operas like Star Wars rather than great films like Dark Cty and Cube.  Well, I'm happy to say that this film is in good company with those two sci-fi thrillers.  Great film that kept me entertained through the end.  I was such a fan after seeing this film for the first tiem that I bought the R2 version (I'm American) from amazon.co.uk rather than waiting for the R1 release.  At the very least, give this movie a try. I doubt you will be disappointed.",1122336000,6,534,4.3
5071644,5,B007AFC0RY,"This is a great film! It is well paced, thoughtful and completely engaging. I'm not going to reveal anything here, but I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and the plot kept me guessing until the very end. I was very impressed with all aspects of the film, from the great acting and effects to the emotive power of the writing and very intelligent directing.

5071645,4,B007AFC0RY,"Stunning, imaginative visuals highlight this sci-fi thriller, an intricate story of multi-layered brainwashing that is actually better on the second and third viewing, because of its maze of plot twists that one can get lost in, and knowing the ending doesn't lessen the impact of the drama.
The brainwashing scenes are brilliant, where a group attends lectures on subjects like ""processed cheese"" and ""shaving cream distribution,"" and in paranoid moments makes me wonder what might be really happening to our brains while watching the average news/entertainment + advertising fare on our televisions.
These scenes are a little like the 1962 ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" only using futuristic technology.

Jeremy Northam is terrific as ""Morgan Sullivan,"" whose reality gets distorted and personality split into several identities. His confusion and fear are believable, and he handles the few action sequences with aplomb. Lucy Liu is strong and beautiful as the mysterious Rita, whose coded telephone number is Job 13:17, ""Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.""
Vincenzo Natali directed this award winning 2002 film with stylish flair, a sleek sophistication, and with excellent pacing and some heart-thumping tension. The cinematography by Derek Rogers is marvelous, with a rather stark look, and the score is atmospheric and lovely, by Michael Andrews.
Intriguing, well acted, and with fascinating imagery, this is more of a mental adventure than the typical ""blow 'em up"" action film, and deserves being seen more than once for full appreciation.
No graphic violence, no nudity, and only the occasional four-letter word make this film suitable for a large audience.
Total running time is 95 minutes.",1119052800,43,1726,5.464419475655431
5071646,4,B007AFC0RY,"There's not a lot that can be said about Cypher without compromising the movie. I saw it on cable. The ""info"" says Cypher is about a man (Morgan Sullivan) confused about his identity when hired by rival firms to spy on each other. To that I can add that identity and the shifting realities that Sullivan experiences are central to Cypher. When you are unsure who you are, what your name is, who your wife is, where you live and who your friends are there is little left to anchor your sense of reality.

He is pushed and bullied by the industrial rivals but the movie never devolves into a cliched action-fest. The movie centers around his shifting identities and the deadly game of industrial espionage in which he finds himself entangled.

My wife and I enjoyed the movie. Cypher is intelligent and doesn't disappoint in the wrap up. I'm planning on grabbing this on DVD when Amazon gets around to stocking it.",1118966400,9,912,4.588957055214724

5071648,5,B007AFC0RY,"This film may be taken in solely as an entertaining sci-fi flick, but it is much more.  The story line is filled with good writing, humor, and drama. A close look reveals the perennial hero's journey and the struggle for meaning.

The deeper story hidden to many viewers in this film is that of discovery of one's soul and true identity.  The world created by the ego is shattered and all delusions about one's identity along with it.  An array of archetypal characters appear within the story which flows like a dream---or, rather, more like a 'nightmare.'  One of the more important of the characters is Rita, which means 'pearl.'  It becomes apparent to this viewer that she represents the 'soul image' of the main character...

I can highly recommend it to anyone who revels in the world of human imagination.

The potential for several layers of meaning in the film make for delightful viewing!",1421798400,2,899,4.754838709677419

5071650,3,B007AFC0RY,"It starts with a fantastic premise-- an everyman gets a job with a company called ""Digicorp"" to become a corporate spy and while on assignment can reinvent himself into whomever he wants to be. The safe suburban everyman who likes ginger ale becomes a golfer who takes his single malt scotch on the rocks and smokes cohiba cigarettes.

This shares a style with other small-budget science fiction films like ""Primer"" in that it has slow pacing, is rich in dialog, and has acting that is merely serviceable.

It also has that style of twist... followed by a twist... followed by a twist... a style which becomes much too convoluted for a 90 minute movie and which gets a bit boring after about an hour. I felt this was cheap.

In the end, though, the payoff ends up being worthwhile.",1407283200,,781,4.60431654676259

It moves on a path that keeps you guessing.  I did not know what was going to happen until the end.

5071653,5,B007AFC0RY,"Proof positive that what makes as great movie is the writing.  Don't get me wrong, this film looks great, but you can tell it did not have the giant blockbuster budget that some films have, but the director and camera crew make it look like a million dollars anyway.  And more importantly it has fantastic script, mood, and great actors! This is a thnking man's, or woman's, movie. it is also very much in the film noir vein.  Films to compare it to would be Dark City or the first Boerne Identity movie.  Through out the movie our main character has identity issues and as has been stated previously, Jeremy Northam's tranformation is incredible, subtle, and in my opinion, Oscar worthy! It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.  Finally, let me end with stating this is in my Top-10 movies of all times along with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  In the Mouth of Madness by John Carpenter, as well as many other horror and Sci-fi films.  I watched more times than I can count and will probably go watch it again here in a minute. A real treat for anyone who has not seen it yet!",1393632000,,1757,4.268072289156627

5071655,4,B007AFC0RY,"Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) leads a boring life with a dominating wife. He seeks fun travel and adventure.  After passing the test he is recruited as a company spy.  Asked about his now persona as Jack  Thursby he is given an open slate. He is having fun, being all he can be, and taking up new habits of drinking, smoking, golf, and possibly a cutie pie, Rita Foster (Lucy Liu). All he has to do is collect data from humdrum convention speeches.

He imagines himself being an army of one. Then the complexities and deceits start and he finds himself a pawn in a multilayered scheme/mystery.  Will Rita introduce him to the man that may be his only way out or his demise?

This has lots of action. The back ground sound actually enhances the film instead of some films where the disjointed noise overwhelms the dialog. You may guess the ending and for sure you will know it the second time around but it is the journey that keeps your interest.

Acting adapted to screenplay so not flashy but appropriate. Beware of film-if you like to know what is going on. Obscurity with apparent clarity is the goal of the filmmakers. I liked it, but it is not a film for everyone...sort of an Orson Welles approach without Orson's flair. That might sound like a knock but is not intended as such...the creators and actors adapt a somewhat offbeat mode but, mostly, succeed....if you have patience.",1371772800,,573,5.042105263157895

5071661,4,B007AFC0RY,"This is a nice, well thought and well done Sci-Fi/thriller directed by Vincenzo Natali, known mainly for his amazing first film, ""Cube"".

Made in 2000, ""Cypher"" was Natali's second film. It is a story about industrial espionnage in a not otherwise defined near future. It begins with a middle aged accountant, Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) who, bored to death with his work and terminally unhappy in his loveless marriage, decides to look for a new, more exciting job. His wish will come true and as the result he will get into an ocean of trouble but also meet the mysterious and beautiful Rita (Lucy Liu)...

The scenario of ""Cypher"" is pretty clever and mostly makes sense. The solution of all the mystery is well hidden, although (rather unusually for me) I actually managed to figure it in the middle of the film. The whole sinister and creepy atmosphere of the film is well done and the ending is good - even in a certain way touching...

Of the four films made until now by Vincenzo Natali this is the second best, after ""Cube"". It is definitely better than the rather disappointing ""Nothing"" and also better than ""Splice"" (which was damaged by the idiotic last 10 minutes). If only he manages to find the same level of efficiency in his oncoming ""Neuromancer"", that can be a film well worth seeing...

Bottom line, this is a honest, above average Sci-Fi B-movie, with some REALLY good twists and an interesting mystery. Enjoy!",1358208000,,1437,4.759036144578313

5071665,1,B007AFC0RY,"I really wanted to like this movie. I tend to enjoy surreal mind-bending tales that require a bit of thought. Sinister corporations involved in illicit experiments on unsuspecting subjects, brain washing scenes straight out of Philip K. Dick's worst nightmares, impressive visuals - this movie has all these things and so should have been right up my dark, strange, little alley.

But unfortunately none of these things could compensate for its glacially slow pace, wooden performances, or a script that's in serious need of a crash cart.

The movie opens with Jeremy Northam's character Morgan Sullivan applying to the mysterious Digicorp to carry out corporate espionage assignments. After that his personality begins to change and he slowly realizes he has unwittingly involved himself in something more than just a little harmless spying for fun and profit. Unfortunately Sullivan never had much of a personality to begin with. We never get a sense of who he is or why he has suddenly taken a notion to plunge into a life of risk and intrigue. We don't know why he fails to question the need for the new identity or the numerous other bizarre things about his ""assignments."" (I think if most people were asked to record lectures on the marketing of processed cheese as an act of corporate espionage they'd be a tad suspicious, yes?) Sullivan is just a dull little man caught up in a web of conspiracy and Northam dithers and stutters through his performance in such a caricaturish manner that it is truly painful to watch. And in the end it is difficult to care what happens to him.

As Sullivan starts to exhibit strange behaviors he is contacted by Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who reveals a little of what Digicorp is secretly doing to him. Eventually she leads him into the role of a double-agent now spying on his erstwhile employers. Lucy Liu mugs the camera and poses in a way that is obviously supposed to be exotic seductive and mysterious. Unfortunatley her delivery is so flat and devoid of conviction that it's hard to take her seriously.

It was at this point (at about the 1-hour mark) that I ran out of patience and stopped watching. Perhaps if I'd stuck it out some Matrix-like, Kubrickesque revelation would have burst upon me. Maybe I would have heard angels...or at least some really cool Moog synthesizer music...but I doubt it.

It is difficult for me to watch a movie when I don't believe in or care about anyone in the film. People have compared this movie to Bladerunner. But right from the first moments of Bladerunner, Ridley Scott presents us with quirky intriguing characters that make us want to find out more about the story. Right from the start Vincenzo Natali gives us two-dimensional non-entities that this reviewer, at least, found unempathetic and uninteresting.

Cypher's machinations may not all hold water by the end of the film, but you're unlikely to care because this twisty little sci-fi thriller about corporate espionage is completely enthralling even when many of its scenes stretch one's suspension of disbelief; if you like mind-benders then you'd do well to check this one out.

The story is fairly original with exception to archetypes (nerdy guys, big bad corporations, etc). It definitely keeps bending and twisting all throughout and lays the suspense on thick.
The acting is good, especially from Northam who was basically a no name until this movie; Lucy Liu is Lucy Liu. Good Directing from the ""Cube"" guy (which you should see if in the mood for a Canadian low-budget psycho-horror) ,Great Editing, Interesting Soundtrack.

*A few neat special effects that are used quite effectively.
*Excellent filming style.  Very solid, fluid, and slick.
*Very nifty production design.  Lots of interesting sets, costumes, and props.  Some of it (like seeing the blocks and blocks of houses that are all perfectly alike) makes you think.
*Interesting use of textures and monochrome colors.
*Good writing.
*Fascinating story.
*Good acting.  It's very interesting to see how most people act robotically in this world.  The main character acts robotically at first too, but transforms magnificently.  Lucy Lui makes for a good, tough, enigmatic character.  All these characters are fascinating.
*Good slick music.

The Bad Things
*Not really an action movie; no major fights, chases, or anything (except maybe for a few brief scenes at the end).  Like ""Gattaca,"" it's purely a sci-fi drama.  Some may find this dull.

This film is surprisingly slick and intelligent; easily comparable to other great sci-fi titles like ""Gattaca,"" ""Dark City,"" or even ""The Matrix."" For that matter, it may also be comparable to most intelligent sci-fi books, like William Gibson's ""Neuromancer."" It may not have any major action scenes, but it manages to be thrilling and interesting through its style, writing, acting, and production design.  Altogether, it's something sophisticated and intelligent that will leave you thinking.

5071671,2,B007AFC0RY,"This picture is very interesting to look at -- some of the images may remind you of ""Metropolis"", or even ""Brazil"" - others may remind you of ""Edward Scissorhands"".  Honestly, however, the visuals were not enough to keep me interested in this strange and convoluted tale.

Like a Bond story (not) this movie pops around from exotic locale (a hotel convention room in Boise, Idaho) to exotic locale (a hotel convention room in Wichita, Kansas).

Our hero does give actor Jeremy Northam an interesting opportunity to play himself down.  Usually seen in suave, debonair-type roles, the handsome Northam plays Morgan Sullivan, a computer dweeb from Madison, Wisconsin - and Northam manages a passable midwestern accent, as well. He got less dweeby and more handsome as the film progressed, which was a good character arc, and a relief.

This is where my interest in the picture stalled, however.  The plot revolves around corporate espionage between two mega-giants: Sunways Systems and Digicorps Corporation.  I guess the problem for me was that I didn't care about either corporation (no-one was wearing a white hat or a black hat), so didn't care which one of them had ""control"" of Northam's mind throughout his sundry brainwashing experiences.

Lucy Liu was lovely to look at, but quite flat in her demeanor.  She was probably supposed to look sleek and sexy, but she looked bored to me -- even when holding a dripping syringe of green mind-control goo.

On his first assignment, he encounters a very attractive young woman Rita (Liu) who introduces him to counter-intelligence. Digicorp is going to brainwash him into permanently believing he's Thursby.  Rita can help him, but he's got to trust her.

Soon, he's swept into a Gordian knot of a plot that literally keeps you guessing and sitting on the edge of your suit til the film ends.

Acting was very well done by everyone in the cast. Both Northam and Liu knew how to put just enough spin on the characters to keep you believing. Northam's slow transition from what he thought Thursby should be to the double-agent was fascinating in the subtle nuances.

Cinematography and effects are very well done for a low-budget film.  The cuts to dream sequences and the surrealistic feeling of the post-brainwashing scenes were appropriately dizzying--very much got you into the character's feeling.

I rented this film, but am definitely considering purchase.  I regret not having seen ""Cypher"" on the big screen, but it's good to watch it with remote in hand.  Occasionally, you do want to rewind and look back.  ""Cypher"" is not a film where you can blink or answer the phone and catch up.",1192579200,2,1653,4.860714285714286
5071673,5,B007AFC0RY,"This is an exceptional movie.  The plot is full of twists and the acting and the effects are decent, to say the least.  I have first watched this one in theater and I decided that I must own it.  I don't buy too many DVd's, but I believed this is special.  The movie is among the best I have seen in a couple of years.
The packing and the overall quality of the product was very good, as is the case with most of my Amazon.com purchases, and it is affordable.

5071674,3,B007AFC0RY,"Jeremy Northam, best known for ""The Net"", and Lucy Liu, best known for ""Chalies Angels"", team up to make a dizzying SciFi ""Cypher"". The majority of the movie centers around figuring out who Northam really is. He starts out working for one company, then spying on another, then spying on the previous, then on both for an independent. Each time he changes his name like his underwear. Who is he really? Who is Liu really? Not a bad story and the acting, directing, and effects are good. I recommend it. Definately worth a rental and many SciFi fans may want to buy it.",1183939200,,567,4.514563106796117
5071675,5,B007AFC0RY,"""Morgan Sullivan doesn't exist."" So Sullivan is told when he is hired by infotech goliath Digicorp to be a corporate spy, operating under the alias Jack Thursby. ""What's he like?"" Sullivan asks. ""What's his personality?"" Finster, Sullivan's controller, answers, ""He's anything you want him to be.""
  Sullivan is thrust into a series of assignments for Digicorp, surreptitiously recording speeches at a variety of industry conventions in off-track localities, Buffalo, Omaha, Boise. His wife is not best pleased that Morgan has undertaken a peripatetic part-time gig - he was supposed to sign on with the family firm. But Sullvan has warmed to his new personality, has developed a taste for premium scotch and Cuban cigarettes, for golf and sailing in the South Seas. ""This is what I want to do."" He assures Finster. ""This is who I am.""
  As Thursby, he meets the enchanting Rita Foster in a hotel bar, but awkwardly flubs his pickup attempt. He begins to suffer excruciating headaches and terrifying nightmares. His marriage has become fretful and insipid. He pitches himself into the convention circuit - his life is a weary succession of airports, flights, hotels, washrooms, and banquet facilities set up for corporate seminars.
  Awaking from one of his brutish nightmares, Thursby is drawn from his room to investigate distracting sounds, following them to the hotel roof where he is accosted at gunpoint by strangers. A leather-laced martinet approaches from a private helicopter. It is Rita Foster. She knows he is a Digicorp spy; she knows about the headaches and the nightmares. She gives him remedies and advice. ""If Digicorp finds out you've met me, they'll kill you. Just remember who you are. You are not Jack Thursby. You are Morgan Sullivan.""
  Now completely devoured by the intrigue, his marriage a baleful shambles, his appetite for Rita Foster whetted, his cover blown, Sullivan cannot turn back. The pills Foster has given him are effective. She contacts him again, now more guardian angel than guarded agent, and rescues him from a session of ""neural programming"" intended to transfrom him into a mindless automaton.
  He wakes from still another frightful dream into his fully fleshed alternate identity Jack Thursby, complete with a new wife, a new home, and a new assignment - to penetrate the spyworks of Digicorp's titanic rival Sunways Systems. He applies for a job at Sunways; he is unmasked. ""According to your neurograph,"" he is informed by Sunways security chief Calloway, ""...you're lying."" Out of options, Sullivan agees to become a mole  - to spy on Digicorp for the benefit of Sunways. ""I want to talk to Rita Foster,"" Sullivan insists. But Foster doesn't work for Sunways. Who does she work for? Calloway discloses reluctantly, ""She works for Sebastian Rooks.""
  Sullivan explodes. ""Who's Sebastian Rooks?""
  Thus the threads of Brian King's occluded plot entangle us. Morgan Sullivan is a human cypher, a fellow in the business of being someone else, an animated puzzle piece who has come loose from the grand design. Director Vincenzo Natali emphasizes the megapuzzle world Sullivan has entered with severe rectilinear backgrounds; every scene is an overwhelming array of right-angle geometry: squares, rectangles and equilateral triangles dominate every frame down to Sullivan's houndstooth coat and square-toed shoes. Digicorp headquarters is a shuddering Gothic cube against a desolate sky; the aerial view of Sullivan's neighborhood a bleak confinement of nestled boxes. The forceful point is made: in this checkerboard universe games will be played.
  ""Cypher"" is painted from the noir palette. High contrast illumination neatly bisects places and faces into precise halves. Shadows lurk in every corner. A gray-blue cast imbues the entire film with necrotic dread. Natural color bursts into scenes so rarely that its serves an ironic purpose - it makes reality look fake.
  Jeremy Northam's Sullivan wears the tentative half-smile of the man unsure of his surroundings but eager to please. His mild adenoidal voice tempers his declaratives: ""Ah, Cohibas. My favorite brand."" ""Scotch. Single malt. On the rocks."" He is treading water. At any moment, the uncertain sea might swallow him.
  Lucy Liu's Rita Foster is a compact action figure, by turns sensual and phlegmatic, solicitious and forceful, endearing and threatening. She knows the game: is she a player or a pawn? Her eyes are as dangerous and inviting as a pair of chocolate mud pies. Her entrance is the first respite from the crushing angularity of Sullivan's enigmatic world, a soft silhouette of graceful curves framed by an ice machine in a hotel hallway.
  No one does benevolent menace like Nigel Bennett. His Finster is a villain you hate to hate. There is no such comforting ambiguity in David Hewlett's sinister wall-eyed Vaultkeeper Virgil Dunn, Sunways Systems molebuster. The cavernous subterranean Vault is Vincenzo Natali's homage to ""Forbidden Planet"", as his neural programming scene is a respectful nod to ""A Clockwork Orange."" Timothy Webber is a flawless Calloway and Kari Matchett is silvery cool as faux spouse Diane Thursby.
  Even with its stunning visual impact, its well-cast actors, and its mind-teasing plot, ""Cypher"" would be motionless in the absence of its arresting soundtrack. Michael Andrews sequences his simple eight-note minor mode piano theme into a half-dozen compelling variations that establish mood and intensify pace. Music and sound effects blend indistinguishably. The ""Cypher"" theme is the rail along which the film chugs, races or idles. In its complete statement over the closing credits, it is a satisfying three-section suite that induces emotional closure.
  A sci-fi thriller need not pretend to profundity; its style may trump substance without disservice to integrity. ""Cypher"" is an aural and visual masterpiece, a smartly executed confection whose sounds and sights are their own reward.",1178755200,3,5946,5.291179596174283

+Very underrated film with an amazing ensemble of actors. Every single actor gives a great performance in this film not just the stars everyone knows Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu.  Nigel Bennet plays his role to perfection. As a fan of stargate atlantis I loved seeing David Hewlett in this film.

8513268,5,B007AFC0RY,"This is one of my favorite movies, but then, I like everything that Vincenzo Natali has directed, including the underappreciated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nothing/dp/B000AQKV1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nothing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haunter/dp/B00FYV7WCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haunter</a>.

There is something odd about the Amazon listing for the 2016 release of Cypher.  Amazon lists the 2005 Miramax DVD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cypher/dp/B0007US7DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cypher</a>&nbsp;as having a running time of 95 minutes, but lists the newly released 2016 Lionsgate DVD as having a running time of 111 minutes.  I asked Vincenzo Natali about this on Twitter, and he said, ""There was only one cut. Very strange.""

Does anyone know whether the Miramax and Lionsgate DVDs do indeed having different running times, and if so, what the differences in the versions might be, or is there a typo in one of the running times?  The IMDb lists the time as 95 min.

I have the 2-disc MC One German DVD of Cypher, and there are a total of 9 deleted scenes which total 16 minutes 34 seconds.  Since 95 mins + 16 mins 34 secs = 110 mins 34 secs, I am assuming that the deleted scenes from the MC One DVD were cut back into the 111 minute Lionsgate version of the film.  The deleted scenes are listed at the DVDCompare.net website as:

- Alternative title sequence (2:10)
- Morgan & Amy I (1:17)
- Morgan & Amy II (2:04)
- Alternative flashbacks I (1:07)
- Alternative flashbacks II (0:35)
- On the plane (1:18)
- New home (4:56)
- Calloway's Friday (1:50)
- Morgan & Diane (1:17)

If I am correct about the 9 deleted scenes being reinstated, one question remains: since the first deleted scene is named ""Alternative title sequence,"" how can they add this to the 95 minute cut of the film without winding up with two title sequences?",1469836800,,2004,5.717171717171717
8513269,4,B007AFC0RY,"Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam,) tiring of his dull suburban life, gets a job as an industrial spy for a huge software house, but quickly finds himself in a bafflingly complex and perilous web of deception involving a rival corporation, brainwashing, a sinister, inaccessible Mr. Big, and a mysterious femme fatale (Lucy Liu) who appears at crucial moments only to vanish.

Cypher is an intelligent sci-fi/espionage/thriller, stylishly filmed and well acted. It's the type of science fiction that depends more on ideas than special effects, though those it employs are convincing.  (It seems to be set in a near future -- at any rate, the technology used  seems a bit beyond what currently exists.)  It's a low-budget film that doesn't look low budget thanks to the the skill of director Vincenzo Natali (best known for Cube,) and features one of the more clever surprise endings you'll find.  Lucy Liu, as usual, is a joy to watch, and the other actors are generally good.  Idiotically rated R for a few profanities.
