8399906,5,B003LWWD5E,"When I purchased this dvd, I hadn't heard of nearly all of the bands/musicians included. I love every single video and band on it though. There are several very well-known acts that I am glad I learned more about and have downloaded more of their music, such as Residents, The Real Tuesday Weld, Dresden Dolls, and The Legendary Pink Dots. Other bands include Little White Rabbits Still Bleed Red (it's a real WTH video) and The Maxi Monster Music Show. The videos, even the 'live' performance ones, are all so creative that I can hardly peel my eyes away, and when I do, the music is great enough to listen to while reading, writing, & making art (it is artistically inspirational, after all).",1314144000,,694,4.650406504065041
