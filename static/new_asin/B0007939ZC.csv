8045993,3,B0007939ZC,"It's been years since little Fanny's father abandoned her and her mother, but she still holds hope of seeing him again one day. She has since been living in the forest with her mother, her grandmother and great grandmother living a short distance away. It's an odd and uncomfortable situation, as those grand-matrons happen to be from her father's side of the family. This, however, is an odd and uncomfortable little film. ""Bye Bye Red Riding Hood"" is a modern-day version of the classic fairy tale brought to us by the combined forces of Hungary and Canada in 1989, and starring the lovely Fanny Lauzier in the lead role of the rather bipolar heroine. Fanny changes moods frequently, as she naturally has some major abandonment issues, and she is very unsure of who to trust, if anyone. Admittedly, it sometimes makes her come off as a brat, but luckily, she's very pretty, so no one gets mad at her. In this ""coming of age"" glance into Fanny's life, we witness her path crossing, somewhat uncomfortably by today's standards, with three male strangers with whom she forms relationships: a city boy her own age, a local man who resembles her father, and a talking wolf. The question is, where will these relationships go, and which are friend and which are foe. It's definitely intriguing, sometimes predictable, sometimes not, sometimes with pleasing results, sometimes not, depending on where you're coming from as a viewer. I would delve more into that from my personal perspective, but it would require offering spoilers. Anyway, where this film loses me is towards the end, when the resolution is just... weird. I suppose it is leaving things open for interpretation, but I find that more often than not to be weak/lazy storytelling. Maybe the filmmakers thought their ideas were obvious, it's not that I don't have theories of what this or that meant, but all I can say is that this wasn't one of those films that left me satisfied with just having theories. Perhaps an audio commentary would have helped here, perhaps not, but the DVD I have of this film (from Entertainment World Inc.) is bare bones, despite claims on the back of the case that it includes a still gallery. Anyway, this film is an award winner, and it presents itself as part 9 of ""Tales for All"", which I assume is some sort of film series that takes fairy tales, modernizes them, and makes them confusing. ""Bye Bye Red Riding Hood"" is supposed to be a family film, though it seems uncomfortable at times, but if I really want to watch a coming of age Red Riding Hood movie, my first choice will be ""The Company of Wolves"" (definitely not a family film). I also can highly recommend the Cannon Movie Tales ""Red Riding Hood"" (it's a great film if you don't mind a few songs mixed in), and honestly, the recent Amanda Seyfried film isn't as bad as you might think. Besides, it has Amanda Seyfried dressed as Red Riding Hood, so... Myself, I'm still glad I own this one. It has redeeming qualities to be sure, and it IS a Red Riding Hood movie. I like to get/see as many of those as I can.",1308700800,,3063,4.632352941176471
