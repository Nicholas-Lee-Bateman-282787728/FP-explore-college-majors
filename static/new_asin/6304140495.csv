7862783,5,6304140495,"I wouldn't let go of these VHS tapes for anything. I've owned these two copies of 'The Hobbit' and 'The Return of the King' for years now and they're still in great condition. I would own the new DVD releases, however 'The Hobbit' DVD by Warner Brothers has an annoying sound defect where a lot of sound is missing. So I've decided to stick with these old VHS tapes until the sound problem is resolved on 'The Hobbit' DVD (if ever). I won't go into detail about what these animated films are about as most everybody already knows the story of these famous tales: especially after Peter Jackson's groundbreaking 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Hobbit' trilogy. These two animated features by Rankin/Bass bring back a lot of great childhood memories and nostalgia. They are what introduced me to author J.R.R. Tolkien's epic stories of Middle-earth. Both films offer wonderful old school animation, great sound fx, talented voice acting, and memorable songs. I'm glad to own 'The Hobbit' and 'The Return of the King' Warner Brothers Classic Tales Collection on VHS. Hopefully one day WB will get it right and fix the awful and noticeable sound defect that has plagued the last two DVD releases of 'The Hobbit'. Until then, I'm sticking with the ole VHS tapes.",1405987200,2,1250,4.791666666666667
7862784,5,6304140495,"Just another great example of old-scool anime... the hobbit was an awsome movie the songs are great and catchy... Smaug is the awsomest... the return of the king was awsome too adults may get annoyed from itbecause it's not as accurate as they would like it but hey the song's in it are better, I write this review for people who love Old School anime... fans of ThunderCats, G.I.Joe and Transformer chances are you'll love this stuff
  P.S. in Return of the King Gollum looks like Duckie for Land Before Time LOL",1031616000,,513,4.565217391304348
7862785,4,6304140495,"I am a great fan of Tolkien's works and I was very sceptical about these two movies. However these two films are great and I enjoyed every minute. The epic music is great and a lot of dialogues/poems are taken from the  original books. The orcs look a little bit childish, but hey it is an  animated cartoon! There are some minor errors in both films which can be  accepted by a fan of Tolkien's works(e.g. in the movie ""The  Hobbit"" the famous Arkenjewel is not mentioned). I recommend this  collector's edtion to all who have read the books and are looking forward  for some new stuff.",926553600,3,587,4.4392523364485985
7862786,5,6304140495,"Of course these movies don't go nearly as in depth as the books do, in fact they distort many of the plots points.  However, these two movies, the Hobbit and The Return of the King are perfect movies for children to watch,  filled with battles, songs, and good-vs.-evil.  I first saw these as a  child, and they were the reason I read the books. These tapes are a must  have for anyone with children, or who loves to see beloved characters come  to life.",925084800,,454,4.345238095238095
7862787,1,6304140495,"These two films are probably as close to unmitigated disaster as it's possible to get. When I watched them for the first time last month, I was already familiar with Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"", and I am  very familiar with the books.  Among other things, I am chairman of  Mithlond, the Tolkien society in my hometown.
Now, I knew that the  LotR-film was awful, but at least that had some redeeming features, such as  the Gollum-character, which is almost good.  I had also been warned that  these two were worse.  And they were!  (I will concentrate mainly on The  Return of the King in the following.)
Everything was wrong.  The  characters looked ridiculous (especially the hobbits), the music was almost  as ridiculous, and the dialogue was in many places just plain silly.
And why so many errors in the plot?  I know that exstensive  simplifications are a must, but Denethor didn't look like a rat, he was a  kingly man.  And Merry didn't ride to Rohan with the message that Gondor  was in need of help, he was in Rohan already.  In The Return of the King,  only one scene is any good, because it's funny, and that is the scene where  Frodo and Sam are caught by Orcs on the road after escaping from the Tower  of Cirit Ungol.  That is so outrageous I couldn't help but laugh.
Many  other errors could be mentioned, but the review guidelines tell me I  shouldn't, so I won't.
The Hobbit doesn't have a scene like that, but  with an effort I might be persuaded to say that the spiders are not so bad.  But apart from that, it's a stupid and boring film from beginning to  end.
My recommendation is: Read the books, and if you have to see a film,  watch Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"".  But be warned: Even that  is poor stuff.",919036800,,1738,4.405063291139241
7862788,5,6304140495,"This is truly the greatest(albeit one of the only)animated epics ever.  The Hobbit is done in American Animation style, with great attention to detail.  The voices are perfect as you may never hear John Huston's voice  again without thinking of Gandalf.  This tale spans a generation and sets  up the next two movies(Lord of the Rings and Return of the King).  It truly  puts the Warner Bros and Disney cartoons to shame.  It appeals to adults at  LEAST as much as the younger audience.  Get Lord of the Rings, too(its  GREAT).  Problem is, you are going to be let down by Return of the King  which is somewhat cheesy and animated by Bakshi in big, sweeping lines,  lacking the detail that spoiled you in the first two movies.",918518400,,726,4.5703125
