2750675,5,B000MVUFAW,"This production follows in the same vein as Nevil Shute's other block buster mini series--""A Town Like Alice"".  Although on a smaller budget and a less grand scale as 'Alice', the movie captures the essences and emotions of Shute's supurb book. Having lived in Australia, I can say that I was swept back to a time in my life I will cherish always--it was that well done.  Be prepaired for a long evening.",1254960000,2,404,4.52054794520548

8173137,5,B000MVUFAW,"The Far Country is worth getting---one of those sleeper stories that are fascinating but only available on videotape.  Michael York's performance is superb.  The Australian bush, where much of the film takes place, is an equal partner with the colorful cast that makes the just-post-would war two come alive.  belongs in your video library",1410652800,,339,5.2407407407407405

8173140,5,B000MVUFAW,"Plus:  It is a great love story with all the struggles of trying to forget the horror of WW II, and start a new life.  People meeting, who were on opposite sides of the conflict and trying to understand their feelings.  A lot of suspense and personal struggle. The DVD played well and the menu functioned as it should. This appeared to be the full length version as there were scenes that we had not seen before when we taped it from the TV broadcast.  Also, sound was good.
Negative:  The picture had a soft focus, certainly not blue-ray, however it is very watchable.
Overall:  I would recommend it.",1367107200,2,601,4.467889908256881
