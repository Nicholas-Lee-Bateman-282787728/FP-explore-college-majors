6910375,5,B00R8K7UPI,"I received Season 7 just the other day after having watched all previous 6 seasons.  This season no doubt presented production challenges in terms of costs as it covered the bloody 63 day Warsaw Uprising of 1944.  However, they did not skimp on the costs in terms of a big cast and special effects.  I would say that this season, in particular, matches any Hollywood production in depicting graphic battle scenes and the special effects that go with them.

For those who don't know about the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, or confuse it with the more known and Hollywood depicted Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 allow me to outline the background story.  The Poles were aware that even being the best ally of the British and Americans in terms of having the biggest resistance movement in occupied Europe and having nearly 200,000 men and women serving alongside British forces in the air, on land and on the sea, they were basically sold out to by Roosevelt and Churchill at the Tehran Conference to appease new ally Stalin.

The insurgents had been planning to liberate their capital since the beginning of the occupation.  The Polish paratroopers training in Scotland were to be used to reinforce the Uprising and secure airfields and such like to allow for air supply drops and troop re-enforcements.  The Normandy landings and the Polish victory at Monte Casino in the Italian campaign, as well as radio broadcasts by the Russians encouraging the uprising created a great the motivation to take up arms.

Despite the reservations of the British and Americans, and some within the London based Polish Government in exile the uprising went ahead, while the Russians not only subsequently stood by but also refused allied supply aircraft (including Polish, British, American and South African bomber squadrons based in Brindisi, Italy) the permission to land for refuelling.  However, young Polish men and women took to the fight and they fought against a greater and better equipped force with bravely to the last bullet.  After it was over 60,000 of them died while the Germans (along with their Ukrainian and Russian auxiliaries) lost 17,000.  The toll of the civilian population due to bombings and brutal executions by the German forces was much higher.  It is estimated that 180,000 Poles died in the Warsaw Uprising. An enraged Hitler ordered that the surviving occupants be driven out and that the city be razed to the ground.  Of course, the proud Poles did soon restore the Old Town to its former glory and rebuilt the city to the thriving economic metropolis it is today.

Overall, this has been a brilliant and honest WW11 television production, and in my view the best ever made.  It depicts key characters throughout the series, both as resistance fighters, German occupiers and as civilians.  It does sanitise the acts of Polish collaborators who often were depicted in many episodes as more dangerous in destroying missions or to the safety of two of the hiding Jewish characters than the relentless hunting down actions of the brutal and ruthless Gestapo and Abwehr.  Some of these collaborators survive the war and then serve the repressive Polish communist puppet Government in the seasons depicting conditions of post war Soviet liberated Poland.  Through the actions and base motives of these one can understand why collaborators, including many Volks Deutche (Poles of full or part German extraction who decided to take up German citizenship), were coldly executed after establishment of the guilt by an underground court. In the depiction of one character there is a degree of sympathy as he act righteously by protecting a partisan in  one scene and then collaborates for sheer survival in another.  As for our heroes they are often seen as dogmatically patriotic and as making costly mistakes with deadly consequence for the comrades in arms and civilian bystanders, while on other occasions pulling off resounding victories against the occupiers.  This makes the series realistic.

This series has very high ratings in Poland where it was produced, and I understand that it is currently being broadcast on Scottish Television and in China.  Sadly, like most things Polish it is unavailable here in Australia.  But despite this it is a factually based story about Polish resistance which needs to be known beyond Poland by those like me who are of Polish descent or interested in Polish WW11 history.  As a war drama it also has high production values, realistic and historical based brilliant plots and strong yet complex character. For those who like quality war movies or war television productions it offers superb acting, a lot of realistic action and a authentic historical context as it impacted on both the Polish Christian and Polish Jewish citizens of occupied Warsaw  It is not dubbed, but the subtitles are very easy to read.  Watch this series if you can as you will not disappointed.",1421280000,9,4917,5.007371007371007

Now it is time to look to the future. In the world of today it is important to remember that the sins of the grandparents cannot be visisted upon the grandchildren.",1501545600,,387,4.5285714285714285
8694559,5,B00R8K7UPI,"What a fantastically done piece on the Warsaw uprising.  If you are not familiar with the Warsaw uprising, you have missed a tremendous testament to the strength of human will and the desire for freedom of the Polish people.  This is such a well done bit of cinema that I cannot recommend it enough.  As other reviewers have stated, it will not play in a US region DVD player, but it will work on a PC DVD player and you only need to translate the menus in order to turn on the English subtitles.  Follow ustawienia (settings) > napisy angielskie (english subtitles) > wlacz (turn on) and voila - English subtitles.  Also, shipping was extremely fast - even from Poland!  My humble salute to the Poles...with whom I have a totally new respect for!  Dugo y w Polsce",1494288000,,764,4.492753623188406

8694565,5,B00R8K7UPI,"Incredible story of Warsaw uprising in Summer of 1944. Not only Polish audience familiar with this tragic struggle against nazis would appreciate to learn about this historic event. The serial, under the title ""Time of Honor"", is known in Europe and not only in Poland, Director made the effort to show the facts in accordance to the historic reality showing young people scouts, students joyned the uprising forces to free the Polish capital from the nazis at the last chapter of the WWII.",1435276800,2,490,4.9156626506024095
8694566,5,B00R8K7UPI,"I have now seen all seven seasons, with this Season 7 backtracking to the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 (not to be confused with the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943) while earlier seasons took us through to 1946 when our heroes took on the Soviet and Polish Communist forces.  I must say that this series is probably the best WW11 series ever made, with Season Seven 7 being the most action packed as it covers the bloody Warsaw Uprising which lasted two months, and was one of the bloodiest battles in WW11.

The series is realistic and its characters complex,  The action is of cinema quality and the drama tense.  I understand that outside of Poland it is being screened on networks in Scotland and China.  It certainly is not even on the radar here in Australia.  For those who like war dramas, or just want to know about the forgotten, and readily dismissed, Polish War this series is a must have.  It is so engrossing that you will watch three or more episodes in the one sitting.",1423958400,3,979,4.497175141242938
8694567,5,B00R8K7UPI,"Season Seven Czas Honoru Powstanie [Time of Honor: Uprising] is actually a prequel to Seasons Five & Six of an outstanding Polish TV series covering the Home Army (AK) during WWII and beyond. The DVD audio/picture quality is excellent, as are the production values used to make the series. Although the spoken language is Polish, English subtitles are available, are easy to follow and not distracting. ---One note, the DVD menu may be a little tricky at first unless you read Polish, but they are easy to navigate after a little trial and error. Anyone interested in the Polish Underground during the NAZI and Soviet occupations should give this series a try---there is enough history and detail to keep students of this period happy, and enough storyline and character development to satisfy the chick-flick criteria.

THE FOLLOWING IS A ROUGH TRANSLATION OF THE REVIEW IN POLISH INCLUDED IN THE LISTING--Something I think Amazon should have included, hint, hint...
""The last days of July 1944. By Warsaw pulled column of German troops withdrawn from the eastern front. This increases the tension - Army staff officers debating Insurrection. In occupied Warsaw continues nerve preparation for liberation. Janek, Bronek, Michal and Wladek are assigned to specific companies, which during the uprising is to constitute the cover Command Headquarters. In anticipation of the advert hours ""W"" company commander, ""Tailor"", tells the Courier from Warsaw to receive instructions from the government in London. When the courier arrives to the Command Headquarters, nobody wants to listen - Uprising decision falls irrevocably. To mobilize their forces fighting the German site. Best informed in the preparation of Poles is the head of the Gestapo, Lars Rainer. The reports its agents that start the uprising is a matter of coming days. Long-awaited emergence of dramatic events will tlem, twists and a stage where they will cross the fate of the characters.""

In closing, all I can say is there better be a Season Eight because Season Six [the latest season chronologically] leaves us hanging big time, and wanting more!",1423526400,3,2114,5.214705882352941
