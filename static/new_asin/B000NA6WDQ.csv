2764082,4,B000NA6WDQ,"A good start in learning how to use less energy in the water. It goes step by step through each part of the stroke and teaches several drills.  As someone who does not easily float in the water, this gave me hope about changing my form.",1262044800,7,236,4.130434782608695
2764083,5,B000NA6WDQ,"I have been a Swimming Coach for 6 years and USA Swimming Coach for 4 years.  All the Total Immersion products are great.  I read Terry Laughlin's book Total Immersion and was hooked.  Tried it in the pool my self and on my swimmers.  My daugher has been the State Champion 4 years in a row (since she was 10 years old) in two Breaststroke events and has gone to finals in all 7 of her events and ddin't place below 5th. The total Immersion way of learning and understanding swim stroke mechanics, and progressing through swimming strokes has been one of the best ways to do it.",1225324800,15,578,4.324074074074074
2764084,4,B000NA6WDQ,"with 2 shortcomings in IMHO:

1) mostly shoot in an outdoor endless pool
2) wish it could explain more of the rules. eg. is it forbidden to use dolphin kicks in breaststroke?",1223337600,2,174,4.4375
2764085,5,B000NA6WDQ,"So, I was planning to do a sprint triathlon, my crawl stroke is abysmal, and I staggered across this DVD as a rental, so I gave it a shot.  It's original target was senior citizens - there's a title left in for ""Breaststroke for Boomers"".  Ignore it, the content here is pretty darn good.

Basically, it's about an hour of video of folks in the water, both above water and below water angles, showing you how to efficiently use a breaststroke.

I already knew the basic stroke, and this certainly helped me correct a few problems I didn't know I had.  A week later, I was able to swim faster and farther with the same amount of effort.  A month later, I finished my triathlon without any problems.

If you already consider yourself an expert swimmer, this might not be for you.  If you figure you can still learn a few things, 5-stars.",1222732800,14,835,4.411764705882353
2764086,5,B000NA6WDQ,"The first contact with this style was the book Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster, and Easier, after reading it I felt prepared to swim like never. So I decided to work on my technique according to it. It wasn't a miracle but for me was pretty close.
But that was not enough, I had to learn how to swim breaststroke and butterfly, then I found this DVDs, all of them by Terry Laughlin. So I thought, if the reading was good, the motion picture should be even better, and I got what I was looking for.
Lesson by lesson, I'm improving my technique and the way I swim. The fact is, I'm working better than any one else at the pool, just because I decided to learn more.
The truth is, I will buy the free and backstroke too...",1203292800,14,749,4.244755244755245

8176493,5,B000NA6WDQ,"This is a great video.  I never learned how to do the breaststroke, but this video gave me hope that I could learn it.  Although I still struggle with the breaststroke, I was able to teach someone else how to do the breaststroke based upon the lessons learned in this video.",1513209600,,274,4.352941176470588
8176494,4,B000NA6WDQ,DVD was okay.,1431820800,,13,3.6666666666666665
8176495,3,B000NA6WDQ,"This video has a total immersion ""in-group"" feel to me. There is an assumption that the viewer already understands how to swim the breaststroke and is looking to adopt the modifications presented. The video demonstrations are clear and the commentary is understandable.",1399507200,4,269,5.428571428571429
8176496,5,B000NA6WDQ,Terry has a knack for breaking down things into simple steps that anyone can follow.  This is one of the most useful video DVDs I have bought.,1355961600,,142,4.2592592592592595
8176497,4,B000NA6WDQ,"I am 63 years old and started swimming about 7 mos ago.  I have the TI swimming book and three of the videos.  They have helped me a lot.  The videos are well done and if followed with practice one can really beging to feel somewhat able to swim.  I have advanced quite a bit, I go to the pool about 3 to 4 times a week and repeatedly do the basic exercises.  Once I discovered that swimmming would take some time and a lot of effort I just buckled down and started getting it done.  Now seven months later I am close to my goal, I have a long way to go, but with the videos and continued effort I think in another six months I'll be in position to hire one of the TI swimming instructors and benefit from the teaching.  Highly recommend the video.",1336608000,,748,4.0476190476190474
8176498,1,B000NA6WDQ,"When I ordered swimming instructions, I expected a pro to show the best muscle movement. My kids may or may not participate Olympics when they grow up, but they'll learn the professional movements in any sport they try. The cover uses a pro as an enticement. The guy in the video is actually no Michael Phelps, but a round belly polar bear, whose postures are in every ways against fluid dynamics. Please, mark your DVD in the appropiate category: the title should say ""fun ways to swim for retirees"".",1313107200,2,501,4.640449438202247
8176499,5,B000NA6WDQ,"I've been swimming the breaststroke for over a year now and I thought I was pretty good at it but after 17 minutes of this DVD I've already learned so much to improve my stroke. My personal swim coach did not give me as much instruction as I've gotten from this video(though I am grateful to her because she taught me to swim from scratch--she had me doing freestyle on day one, then taught me breaststroke and basic fly over several weeks).

I don't really recommend books just because reading doesn't translate to swimming for me... But I highly recommend the video.

I cannot wait to get in the pool to apply the techniques to refine my breaststroke! Thank you, Terry!",1304812800,9,1579,7.670329670329671

8176501,5,B000NA6WDQ,"I have been swimming the Breast stroke for 10 years, it turns out that my stroke was very inefficient. Seeing Terry's video and implementing his technique has improved my speed by at least 50%. Terry is a rock star!! I can't recommend this video enough.",1271635200,10,253,4.644444444444445
