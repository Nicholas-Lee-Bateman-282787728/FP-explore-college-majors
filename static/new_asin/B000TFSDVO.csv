8208853,5,B000TFSDVO,"I saw this recently and really enjoyed it. I thought it did a very good job of presenting its view on the topic of taboo sibling relationships. It causes one to understand how sibling can fall in love and how the world around them can be affected. Perhaps the movie cast a more biased opinion in favor for such relationships but if that's the case does it well, while still showing both sides. The movie will probably leave an impression on you at the end no matter what your original opinion is.",1454198400,,496,4.4021739130434785
8208854,4,B000TFSDVO,"First off, this movie is about incest. Just a warning in case that bothers you.

Christine and Christophe are brother and sister who have been in love with each other since they were kids. Now Christine is married to another man and has two kids, but she's still having an affair with her brother. It's made clear that she has tried to break free of their relationship in the past, first by getting married, then by having a baby. Neither have loved anyone else as much as they love each other, though.

It's a sad movie, very intense and emotional. It seems that one of them is always crying! It's perfectly understandable, however, since they are about to be separated by 3,000 miles. As a viewer, I wanted (though I know it's icky)for them to end up together. It seems impossible for them to be happy apart, but impossible for them to be together. It'd be nice if they could go back in time and run away together, but now it's too late.

It's interesting that their mother is aware of their relationship, though she disapproves. And Christine's twelve year-old daughter is in-love with Christophe, too, even though she knows that he and her mother are together. I can't quite blame her for being attracted to him. He is kind of hot. He's easy to watch.

The film gets right into the sex, and there are a lot of scenes in bed. I thought it was all dealt with very well, though. The ending is rather abrupt, and I wasn't sure what was going to happen. I guess it was somewhat inconclusive, but I assume it's not going to be a happy life for either of them.

Personally, I would have loved to see them when they were younger and all of this was starting. It makes for an interesting study on a subject that people don't want to talk about.",1283126400,8,1739,4.404984423676012
