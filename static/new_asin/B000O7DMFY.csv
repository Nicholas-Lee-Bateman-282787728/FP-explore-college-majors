Winner of a 2007 Accolade Award of Excellence

DAVKA:
""The wildest, most unhinged drum solos I have ever witnessed... It's a rock show with pyrotechnic grandeur, just without the rock or the pyrotechnics."" -- Rob Harvilla, EAST BAY EXPRESS

""Davka's four musicians whirl their spells with a supple interplay of violin, cello, bassoon and percussion. Their compositions and improvisations, swirling around a center of enlivened klezmer melodies and pulsing Middle Eastern rhythms, weave a dancing, winding path through the diversity of Jewish cultural and historic experience..."" -- Jerry Karp, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

KITKA:
""Simply amazing harmonies...truly this is the most wonderful singing I have ever heard.""
  -- David Crosby, CROSBY, STILLS, AND NASH

""The singing of KITKA was tangy, excellently in tune and verbally communicative.""
  -- Andrew Porter, THE NEW YORKER

""KITKA's songs are hauntingly beautiful, simple, yet otherworldly. The rich sound these women produce resonates as if energized by the universe itself, as if it were calling all live beings and still matter into togetherness and unity.""
  -- Ching Chang, SAN FRANCISCO BAY TIMES.",1322524800,,1183,5.5474860335195535
