2652822,5,B000I2KOB0,"If you're okay with fullscreen versions, these are 2 entertaining films for a very decent price.

Highlights here for me...

First Strike...
- Ski slope chase.
- Hotel suite fight.
- Warehouse ladder battle.

Mr. Nice Guy...
- Van Fight with Sammo Hung as a cyclist.
- Construction site fight.
- Jackie vs. Giancarlo end sequence.

I currently favor First Strike over Mr. Nice Guy, but it's nice to have 2 films to choose from. And Mr. Nice Guy is directed by Sammo Hung(!). These movies emphasize acrobatic excellence & the creative use of props in a fight over the straight-up, one-on-one fights we've seen earlier in Jackie's career. In both films Jackie plays a character named ""Jackie"", which does simplify things a bit :). He's like James Bond in First Strike, and he plays a celebrity chef in Mr. Nice Guy. First Strike has a globe-trotting feel to it, going from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia to Australia. Mr. Nice Guy is set strictly in Australia. These may not generally be considered Jackie's absolute best, but I love the creativity in the action scenes in both.

Sammo does a decent job directing Jackie as a chef in Mr. Nice Guy; he also directed Jackie as a skateboarding caterer in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wheels-on-Meals/dp/6305234922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wheels on Meals</a>&nbsp;circa 1984. Notice the similar ""food theme"" in both.:) It's not a coincidence; the similarities are many. In both films, Jackie is essentially a ""nice guy"" who helps a female being chased by thugs, and who then gets promptly caught up in the action. Both films briefly feature a motorcycle gang. Both films strongly reference a major softdrink; in Wheels it's Coke, and in Nice Guy it's Pepsi. Both include a scene where someone who is being chased hides in a food vending vehicle; in Wheels it's the yellow catering van, and in Nice Guy it's the ice cream truck. Both films include celebrity cameos and people from the ""Lucky Stars"" series; in Wheels it's the mental hospital patients, in Nice Guy it's the ice cream vendor and Richard Norton as Giancarlo, among others. In both films Jackie accidentally puts his hand on a female's chest. In both films, a fight happens around a yellow construction vehicle. But Wheels has the matchup with Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez, often considered Jackie's best one-on-one fight scene, and that's one thing that Mr. Nice Guy can't really compete with.

-About 1.33:1 ""fullscreen"" editions: At first on my widescreen tv the lower part of the scene selection screen was cut off from view, making scene selection difficult. This was easily fixed by adjusting the zoom setting on my tv. I mention this in case some people experience the same thing. Also- fullscreen panning & scanning isn't always perfect- sometimes a little too much visual information gets left out. If you're a big fan of these films it might be best to find widescreen editions, but for an action double feature at a reasonable price, I consider this a really sweet deal.",1294012800,2,3032,5.02988047808765
2652823,3,B000I2KOB0,"This is a single disc set, with both movies on the same side of the disc. I'm giving it three stars because this is only the fullscreen versions, otherwise it would be a 4. Jackie Chan's First Strike used to be my favorite Jackie Chan movie about ten years ago. Mr. Nice Guy is a decent movie although not as good as First Strike. This is a good buy if your a Jackie Chan fan and widescreen isn't to important to you.

Oh, and if your new to the older Jackie movies and wondering why some actors look like they're speaking English and others appear to be dubbed, it's because some of the actors spoke their native language and others did not. That way anyone could be cast in a role, knowing they would be dubbed later. So there is no original language audio track for alot of Jackie's movies because the dubbed version kind of is the original version.",1261872000,8,852,4.325
2652824,2,B000I2KOB0,"Mine came cracked. It still worked, but the sound is low bad that when you play it on the laptop you can barely make out what's being said. Thank God it was cracked because I was able to return it and instead got the Extreme Chan Action Pack - Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble in the Bronx, and Jackie Chan's First Strike. This one was WAY better, and it is much cooler to have all the movies in a single DVD - with much better sound quality. THe movies are amazingly great and the price for the extreme chan pack is good. This double feature dvd is kind of blah.",1211846400,,551,4.064220183486238

8143722,4,B000I2KOB0,"I watched this film first on a TV session, and bought the dvd for that reason. My only complaint was that part of the TV movie was cut from this version (where Jackie Chan follows 2 very attractive girls speed walking as he needed to ask for money).
In my life, I have never seen anyone as large as the fellows in First Strike - the guy had to bend down to get in the doorway!

How Mr Chan can move so quickly is far beyond me. His smile is so charming despite how many people continue to attack him.

The clips at the end show how dangerous the choreography is - and the compassion shown between the actors. Truly remarkable!",1506729600,,626,4.1652892561983474

8143726,5,B000I2KOB0,Jackie Chan' movies always have comedy and action,1475625600,,49,5.25
8143727,3,B000I2KOB0,First Strike is a great action movie. That's all it is. It doesn't have any drama but that's not fair criticism. The action is constant without being too constant and it has great fights and stunts. My only big criticism is directed at New Line. Why did you cut the scene where the two hot women are running in booty shorts. That was a poor decision. Mr Nice Guy is okay. The best part is Sammo Hung's scenes as a bicyclist.,1470096000,,424,4.246913580246914

What I didn't like was that the dvd case was opened before maybe used , and they just wrap the plastic on the outside to make it brand new I am disappointed on that one.",1438905600,,306,3.9516129032258065
