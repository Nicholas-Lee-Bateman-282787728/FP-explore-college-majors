5741565,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Ryner inner voice: ""People die. But it doesn't matter to you... Everything. Yours to toy with. Release it. Open up. Kill. Everything. Until everything disappears before your eyes. Don't defy me. Your molecules shall scatter like sand. God. Devil. Hero. Monster. What will you call me?""
Well as usual I will not include any kind of summary or some sort of synopsis by know you know most of you who have read some of my few item reviews know my motto of that if you have an interest on this show do a lite bit of research that why we have Google and Wikipedia for but anyways moving along you know there is not much I can say about Densetsu Yuusha no Densetsu without sounding like a fanboy of the series so isnted of having me going on and on about how good this series is I will say that it's so good that I think I already watch it over ten times without getting tired of it one bit to me this is how good this series is but anyways let me recommend some series that my kind of share some similarities with this series so you can get an idea of what kind of show this is starting off with: Chrome Shelled Regios is one of those series that goes under the radar but is worth watching it or at least to me it was Code Geass just because we have Jun Fukuyama awesome performance in both of the series and also because both shows revolved around mystic eyes that grant extraordinary yet fearsome power and lastly but not less important Hagure Yuusha no Estetica awesome series it might not be that similar but they both share this essence or something like that.
In conclusion I just hope this helps to decide any potential customer to purchase this item because believe me you will not regret it.
PD: Remember at the end of the day we all want our own kingdom of afternoon naps right?",1387929600,,1782,4.29080118694362
5741566,4,B00CU6WAZU,"All we need really to feel this one of the best around is a 2nd season a finisher, if it can get that it'd be perfect.",1382659200,,118,3.576923076923077
5741567,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Everything about this screams Good Stuff! The characters are entertaining, the storyline is enthralling, great animation and music. Well done through and through.
My only complaint is that the storyline ends on a ""rushed(?)"" note which left me wanting because a lot of plot points were left hanging. I read up on this title and learned that this anime is only really the prelude to a larger story which explains why that is. That being said though I still give it 5 stars because I'd rather have what is than be left not having seen it at all.",1382486400,2,543,4.551020408163265
5741568,5,B00CU6WAZU,While the name may be a mouthful this show was really good. The characters are memorable and the plot is also enjoyable. If another season ends up in the works I will definitely order it as well.,1381881600,2,195,4.297297297297297
5741569,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Yeah, got this on a whim since I was subtly craving a Lodoss/Escaflowne type series.  The title definitely threw me (it felt lazy), but i'm glad that didn't stop me from the impulse buy.  This series has a lot of good going for it: very compelling main characters, a strong supporting cast, interesting overall story conceit, strong animation, and good overall execution.  In all, this is definitely worth watching.  Please note, the series does have a definite conclusion, but there is plenty of room for the series to continue/have a sequel (based on the fact the stories the series originated from continued further).  In all, this is a great piece of escape if that's what you're looking for.",1380412800,12,696,4.864406779661017
5741580,5,B00CU6WAZU,"This is series has such beautiful animation, daring fight scenes, very lovable three main characters, complex internal political affairs and some deep and dark story line that makes the viewer's interest at its peak with each episode.  The only flaw with this anime series maybe its title that seems too repetitive that might have dismissed some people at first glance when searching for animes to watch.  But besides that, if this series had a complete finish, it would probably be on par with FMA: Brotherhood, maybe close to Code Geass and/or Death Note as well if they continued.  I wonder if we can sign petition for the continuation of LoLH?",1487289600,,647,4.863636363636363

5741584,5,B00CU6WAZU,This is my favorite anime. It's was delivered before the date. Thank you ,1461542400,,73,4.615384615384615

5741586,5,B00CU6WAZU,"It's a very good series just wished it had a continuation season because, I enjoyed it a lot. & because there were some unanswered questions that I really want to know about.",1452988800,2,174,4.46875
5741587,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Item was received promptly and in perfect condition. Item worked with no skips or pauses and that is good enough for me.
I thoroughly enjoyed this series- it is quite humorous- and was glad to see it on Amazon for a lower price than other sites.",1450915200,,245,4.3478260869565215
5741588,5,B00CU6WAZU,"One of my favorite anime series. Was so bummed there's no second season. I laughed out loud so many times during this series. The ridiculous name put me off at first but once you dive in you discover a series with a great plot (although it is spliced up into an interesting order), interesting characters, and some of the funniest dialogue.",1449187200,,340,4.590163934426229
5741589,5,B00CU6WAZU,"I highly recommend this for any fans of bloody anime, while not dark as Berzerk there is plenty of gore and dark scenes throughout. This complete collection is Season one twice, once regular dvd four discs and a separate copy in blueray four discs. Total of Eight discs. Keep this in mind if you want a true complete collection.",1443398400,,328,4.576271186440678
5741620,5,B00CU6WAZU,Love this one too but like the irresponsible captain tylor didn't finish you can see it at the end.,1433980800,,99,4.2631578947368425
5741621,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Legend of the legendary heroes is an amazing anime that most likely will never be truly finished. I'm going to warn you anime fans, like me, that love endings. Lolh has no true ending. Like most series its based on a light novels series that hasn't been finished. That being said if you're new to anime it means the ending of the show is left usually on a cliffhanger. Now beyond that let's get on with the review. Story wise Lolh doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does make the wheel better. Our hero is powerful and wise... But lazy as hell. So now left to save the world he finds himself caught in battles he doesn't want and comrades with people who see him as a fool initially. The story plot wise is nicely paced, and it's a genuine good plot. Animation is fantastic, battles look gorgeous and even down time moments look vibrant. Sound is also very nice with an opening you'll want to hear over and over. Overall Lolh is an amazing anime with everything going for it except the ending. Still you'll enjoy the ride, trust me.",1433548800,,1031,4.403141361256544
5741622,5,B00CU6WAZU,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The story is amazing, with an equal mix of humor and drama, and the characters are astounding. The English dub cast was the best group of actors that could have been chosen, and the writing for the adaptive script is stellar. If you prefer the Japanese with subtitles, the cast and writing are just as lovely. PLEASE give this show a chance, it will be worth your time.",1432857600,,417,4.291139240506329
5741623,3,B00CU6WAZU,"The story goes no where at the end. The art work is OK and nothing fancy. The story started out very interesting till end. I find this anime with many good developed characters. However the story never ends. I will say when the story ends, you feel like you are still watching beginning stage of story.",1429833600,,302,4.410714285714286

5741625,5,B00CU6WAZU,This is a great show. I bought this because I wanted to watch something new. And boy was I surprised. This is one of my favorite anime of all time. The action is awesome. And it always gives me goosebumps when Ryner goes all crazy. And f#$k s#$t up.,1425600000,,249,4.1020408163265305
5741626,5,B00CU6WAZU,One of the best series I've ever seen!,1424217600,,38,3.875
5741627,5,B00CU6WAZU,This show is amazing if there is one anime you must see its this one its so good that you can watch it multiple time and still feel as if this is your first time watch highly reccomend this show. not that many five stars out there but this is definetly one no doubt,1421539200,,265,3.925925925925926

5741629,5,B00CU6WAZU,How I just love Rainier! And this anime would be nothing without Farris and her dongo. This anime has lots of action and a great story line. This anime definitely have a spot in my anime collection.,1416700800,,198,4.378378378378378
5741630,5,B00CU6WAZU,This was a great purchase. You get a lot for a very fair price unlike a lot of animes that sell 7 blu ray episodes for $40. This anime needs more likes and purchases so they can continue this series! I loved it and I want to see the end. So make the purchase and help them out!,1410480000,,277,3.793103448275862

5741632,5,B00CU6WAZU,"This is one of the best anime I have ever seen.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a sweeping, story driven adventure.  The only two real downsides to this anime are 1) there is only one season so that there are a number of loose ends that are kind of left for your imagination and 2) because there are only 25ish episodes there are several story arcs that seem to appear out of nowhere or move a little faster than I might prefer.

Having said that this story is enthralling and deeply moving with some surprisingly philosophical moments.  It touches on bigotry, racism, necessary evil, sacrifice for the greater good, friendship, and whether we are born good or evil.  There is a little romance that builds towards the end and after you get to know the characters I find many of their interactions with each other through the series to be quite funny.

It comes with the complete series both in blue ray and dvd in the same package.  I'm not sure why but you get both for the price of one so I won't complain.  I highly recommend you buy this item!",1402185600,12,1060,4.4
5741633,5,B00CU6WAZU,"An amazing series that I watched from beginning to end. For me, it started slow and it picked as the story progressed. I was surprised how it ended, but it was truly fitting. Nope, I will not give it away either. Ryder and Ferris are so odd together, but in battle they are ferocious. This is the Blu-ray / DVD Combo and can truly see the difference of the 2 versions. The Blu-ray is clear and vibrate colors all the way around. The DVD version is not as vibrate. Overall, I believe you would love the series no matter if you buy the complete series or the other that is offered.",1393718400,,579,4.225225225225225
5741634,5,B00CU6WAZU,I love this series. I could not stop watching it. It is one that if you own anime that is a must to add.,1393718400,,104,3.375
5741635,5,B00CU6WAZU,"I really enjoyed the box set, i like the fact that its blue ray and dvd combo. as for the anime itself it was AWESOME!!! I really do hope they continue the story line for this anime.",1392768000,,182,3.945945945945946
5741636,5,B00CU6WAZU,"This is a much better anime than i would have expected i do very much recommend it.  The anime actually has 24 episodes, that being said there is no real ending to it they set the series up for a second session but never got the green light for it.  So i love this anime but hate that i have no conclusion.",1392336000,,306,3.9193548387096775
5741637,4,B00CU6WAZU,"I watch this anime on netflix. And really liked it. I do want to get this. But I notice a mistake in the decription. ""Contains 13 episodes. "" So I found this same item on Funimation's site. Since they are the ones that liscensed this anime. And their's say contains 25 episodes. So Im guessing amazon made a typo here. Anywho further up on this product. It says 8 discs. There is no way 13 eps can fit on that. Plus, if you look at part one, which run time is 5hrs and 25. Part two is 5hrs. And this one says 10hrs and 25mins. So Im pretty sure this is the complete series with all 25 eps. XD",1391040000,3,592,3.9831932773109244

8586390,3,B00CU6WAZU,"This is a review of the S.A.V.E edition which has blu-ray and DVD versions. I watched the blu-ray.
I very carefully didn't read the reviews or synopses of this series as I wanted to see it on its own merits. This is the complete version which has 24 episodes.
I didn't know what to expect but I certainly did not expect what I actually saw. This had real potential as a dark, machiavellian political thriller. As such it would have been a very refreshing change. A lot of thought has clearly been put into political and historical background for the series. It's a shame that most of this is unused. It's like Tolkien writing all of the background for Lord of the rings and then only writing the synopsis. In fact the two story arcs Ryner and Sion don't seem to interact much. The real fault of this is that it doesn't use the epic history very much. However a much, much bigger fault is the characters. There's not one character that you feel much for. They are just players on a stage mouthing lines. This gets quite tiring after 24 episodes. Although this ends on a cliff-hanger I found I didn't care.
The animation is actually quite good. I normally prefer the Japanese voice actors but in this case the English voice cast is excellent and the translation is much better than the subtitles.
In the end this has characters that don't provoke empathy, a plot which never really gets going, and an epic history that isn't used. Very disappointing.",1523059200,2,1448,4.551724137931035

8586394,5,B00CU6WAZU,"Probably one of my favorite anime of all time, I'm furious that they left things on such a cliff-hanger. There was so much material left overy for another season or at least 3 movies, but instead they ended things and I can't find the Manga or light novel anywhere. This is truly a phenomenal anime with a great deal of mystery incorporated in it. I can watch it countless times over and never be bored of it, but the more I watch the more I wish there was more to it.",1491523200,,468,4.153846153846154
