8471999,4,B005GP7ED0,"i bought this set of films to help complete my Hitchcock movie collection. This set includes three films: The Farmers Wife, The pleasure Garden, and Easy Virtue. These are all silent films. 'the Farmer's Wife' is actually a pretty good comedy about a widowed farmer who wants to find a new wife but none of the prospects are actually interested in him. But he finds his true love in an unexpected place. 'the Pleasure Garden' is a film about love, sex, and infidelity. Although certainly 'tame' for our day and age, it was definitely risque for its time. The third film, Easy Virtue, was about a young and beautiful woman who is married to an alcoholic and begins an affair with another man. She leaves her husband to live an immoral life, once again with scenes quite risque for its time. Personally i enjoyed watching all three of these films. Because they are both black and white as well as silent, many young people would not be able so sit through them. (At least not my family). But I find the movies enjoyable and well worth the time it takes to be entertained for about 75-90 minutes per film.",1441584000,,1102,4.542713567839196

8472001,2,B005GP7ED0,"I totally agree with the last reviewer's opinion. Remastered...my butt! The only reason I give it 2 stars is 1 -the price is cheap, and 2 -it may be the only U.S release for the first film The Pleasure Garden.

The Pleasure Garden (with it's redone titles) and Easy Virtue look the same as the best available DVDs out there, which is pretty dismal. The Farmer's Wife is cropped badly, and the print is horrid. This film is available in France from Studio Canal in a great print on a box set.

Yeah, and that f******g Screen Gems logo in the top right corner throughout all 3 titles is unacceptable, ignorant and insulting.",1321228800,11,622,4.495575221238938
8472002,1,B005GP7ED0,"Don't waste your money on this set. Very prominent in the upper right corner of the screen is the ""Screen Gems"" logo---all through the movie, all three movies! On my screen, the logo is about 4"" x 4"", and is located about 2"" from the top and 4"" from the right edge.
Since I have purchased what I presume is a legal print of these movies, I would expect that these would not appear. I can well understand that movies shown on Turner Classic Movies include their logo to ensure that those prints are not illegally duplicated for sale. These three films released by ""The Archive AG/Screen Gems"" are supposed to be based on original negatives, but they do not appear to have had any restoration work and none is claimed on the packaging. The opening credits for The Pleasure Garden do not appear to be original. The opening credits for The Farmer's Wife is not centered correctly and is partially obscured both left and right. In this movie there are a couple of inter-titles that are completely illegible. The credits for Easy Virtue is very much out of focus. I know theses movies are very old, but I wish instead of this company that MGM/ 20th Century-Fox had released these the same way they released ""The Lodger."" As long as these movies continue to be released sloppily, people will resist buying them. I can imagine the outrage if a more recent movie was released for DVD with the studio logo showing throughout. I wonder if the store I purchased this set will refund my money. A staggeringly beautiful Blu-Ray of ""Sunrise"" was released in the UK on a region-free disk. The Blu-Ray contained both a 1.20:1 and 1.37:1 aspect ratio of this great movie. It is part of the Masters of Cinema series in cooperation with 20th Century-Fox. I guess UK and Europe are more confident of an interest in these movies than in North America. This set will only confirm whatever prejudice people feel towards silent film.",1320883200,15,1908,4.631268436578171
