2728248,1,B000MD1IS8,cannot give 0 stars. so giving 1 star. hopeless movie,1424822400,,53,4.4
2728249,3,B000MD1IS8,"Typical bollywood movie with an international spy thriller take - has some good moments, and some poor ones.  Sunny looks way too rotund and chunky to be a kick-ass agent.  His stoic performance borders on being expressionless.  The only solid performances come from the two actresses, Preity and Priyanka, especially Preity, who saves the movie from turning into a total bore.  Amrish Puri delivers a credible villain, but there is a fair amount of overacting by him and many others.  Some of the story line makes no sense, and the movie is about an hour too long.  I did not find the protagonist particularly heroic - he seems to be very comfortable using the women around him to his advantage, at grave danger to themselves.  Its not bad - but could have been much better.",1424476800,,775,4.696296296296296

8167890,4,B000MD1IS8,"I am a fan of Sunny Deol. While this is not one of his best, it is a good movie because of the interplay between Deol and Preity.  The plot is uneven; good in some places, lacking in others. Nevertheless, it is worth watching.",1487894400,,226,4.136363636363637
