8600002,2,B004GTKJDE,"This whole box set was a big disappointment.  I could not believe that the whole box set contains only raw footage.  These are dvd's that you will surely fast forward through the majority of the footage.  There was no indication of what you were watching other than figuring it out on your own and the chapter selections did not match up to the scenes.  If you want to watch chapter 4 of something then select it, rewind it for a few minutes and then you will see the beginning of the chapter you selected.  This whole set was poorly put together from the outside to the inside.  Don't waste your money.",1325116800,6,603,4.387387387387387
