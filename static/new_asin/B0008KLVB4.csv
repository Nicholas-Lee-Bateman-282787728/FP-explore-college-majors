2259755,5,B0008KLVB4,"hey swailes... you can kiss my ass if you don't like Walker, Texas Ranger. This show rocks, and its very enjoyable. Sure that every episode sees Walker come out on top, its very cool show and I've been waiting forever for it to come out on DVD.",1116288000,4,244,4.212765957446808
2259756,5,B0008KLVB4,"Please say you are kidding, although you are from Texas so I doubt you are.  Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors of all time and Walker Texas Ranger is the worst television show of all time.  That being said, everyone must own this for those very reasons, it is so bad it is good, it's the worst so it must be the best.  Get it because it's the funniest show ever made.",1115769600,7,373,4.013513513513513
2259757,5,B0008KLVB4,"In the annals of history, when all the fuss and speculation has died down, I have no doubts that it shall come to pass that Chuck Norris will finally be recognized as one of the finest actors in all recorded time. He has no rival, no parallel in this world or in any other; no one can compare to the sheer beauty and magnitude of his immaculate body of work.

In the year 1993, the people of this shallow, empty world were offered a glimpse of heavenly ambrosia in the form of a television show known as ""Walker, Texas Ranger."" Among scholars, philosophers, religious leaders, and foreign diplomats, there is no question that this show is the pinnacle of mankind's achievement in any field. The works of Shakespeare, Newton, Popeil, Christ and Mozart all pale in comparison to the unbelievable perfection found in this divine accomplishment.

But, sadly, the world was just not ready for the kind of pure, unadulterated brilliance found in this show, and in the year of Our Lord Two Thousand and One, A.D., we learned that we were to be deprived of Walker's sublime genius. This DVD set is a chronicle of that final year, a television season which some have seen as a parallel to the Biblical book of 'Revelations' because of the prophesies revealed therein.

I recommend this DVD set on the strength of one episode: ""White Buffalo."" In just one short hour of television, Chuck Norris, believed by many to be the true Messiah, shows us pitiful mortals the light. The episode's title refers to a drug that has found favor with a group of young ruffians who live on an Indian Reservation. This ""reservation"" can be seen as a modern representation of a leper colony, where all the undesirable elements of society are sent to live. In the episode's climax, two youths who are heavily under the influence of 'white buffalo' go crazy and fire gunshots at random items in the type of retail outlet typically known as a 'convenience store.' This act is obviously a parallel of the destruction of the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. In the iconic final shot of the episode, a large statue of a white buffalo sheds a solitary tear for what has befallen. This haunting image is a symbol of the way mankind corrupts and debases everything pure and beautiful that is given to us from above, (such as ""Walker, Texas Ranger."") I'll admit, it's hard not to be spiritually moved by the site of that white buffalo and his lonely teardrop.

If there is a heart in your chest and a soul in your body, if you believe in the existence of a divine being, if you are just a sad, desperate person in search of some kind of salvation, I beseech you! Purchase this DVD set at once! It may be the closest any of us poor sinners ever get to a glimpse of the sweet afterlife.",1115596800,14,2751,4.551515151515152
2259758,4,B0008KLVB4,"I am like many people who have been waiting for this series to come out onto DVD - excited that it is finally happening, but also a bit perplexed as to why the last season and not the first.  The only thing I can think of is that this season is being released first to pay tribute to Noble Willingham who played CD Parker.  CD Parker dies in the last season (He's never seen again after mid-Season 8 but the Rangers are informed of his death and CD's funeral is shown in the fourth episode of this season - and then the nature of his death is revealed in the series finale).  Noble Willingham died January 2004.  He left the series to run for a political office (and lost).

As for this season itself, the season starts after the wedding of Alex and Cordell and ends with the birth of their child.  It includes many good (perhaps even great) episodes such as:

""Home of the Brave"": (the season's first episode) Walker struggles to rescue a boy trapped in the basement of an apartment building after a bomb was detonated.

""White Buffalo"": A statue of a white buffalo begins to shed tears at the same time the Texas Rangers are battling a new drug called 'White Buffalo'.

""Faith"": Dionne Warwick plays a grandmother raising her granddaughter (who desperately needs an organ transplant to live).

""Desperate Measures"": Gage unknowingly travels with two escaped convicts after his motorcycle breaks down.

""Legends"": Martial arts legends (such as Bill 'Superfoot' Wallace and Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) make a guest appearance.

""Without a Sound"": Gage loses his hearing from a car-jacking gone wrong.

""6 Hours"": As known as 'HeatherCam' A young woman is kidnapped and her death is planned to be viewed live from the Internet.

""Division Street"": Hulk Hogan plays a former gang member whose life got turned around and now struggles to help rescue the other gang members on the street by opening a community center.

This season also includes a 4 part storyline that I call ""The Wizard"" (""The Winds of Change""; ""Lazarus""; ""Turning Point""; ""Retribution"") in which the Texas Rangers enlist the help of a computer hacker serving time in prison to battle another hacker that's getting undercover law enforcers killed.

These and about a dozen more episodes can be found in this final season.  Even if this was to become the only season to be released (which I highly doubt) at least there are some good episodes to watch.",1113609600,45,2413,4.73444976076555

2259760,5,B0008KLVB4,At last!! walker texas ranger is to be released on DVD.

I can't remember her name or the title of the story, but she was a very close friend of Walkers.

There is nothing clever about it.  5' 3"" Nia Peeples beats up 5 huge dirtbags and everyone gets arrested.  Norris remains asleep throughout the episodes, as 9 years of shows has honed this ability.  The shame is that the plots start out nicely, but no creativity is introduced from there.  The cleverest criminal can't add 2 plus 2 in the last 5 minutes of the show and every episode ends with Texas Rangers out-kicking any number of people despite the possession of firearms.  Poor acting, terrible dialog, complete predictability and frustrating repetition highlight this series.  There is a good bit of action attempting to disguise all the other shortcomings, and apparently it succeeded for 9 years.  Give credit where it is due, low budgets and entertaining the mindless worked for 9 years.  And I really do like Nia Peeples, just not in the invincible role.

1. If you stand in front of a mirror and say ""Bruce Lee"" three times with the lights off, Chuck's fist will reach out and smash your nose. (Bruce was the only human to ever beat Chuck in a fight)

2. Chuck once helped an old lady change a tire on her car, without having to use a jack or crowbar. He simply stared at the flat tire, with that piercing gaze that he had at the beginning credits of the Walker tv series, and the tire reinflated itself.

3. Chuck was passing by a construction site once and overheard a guy saying that he couldn't find his hammer. Chuck leaped onto the roof of the building and hammered the nails in with his fists. The construction worker stood there in silent awe.

4. NASA called upon Chuck in the early 80's to save the US from an approaching asteroid. They sent Chuck up into orbit in a secret mission, during which he side kicked the asteroid into tiny fragments. This is a little known fact and if you request the FOIA (Freedom Of Information Act) file from NASA, they will send you a copy of the file along with an unreleased episode of Walker featuring a chunky Steven Seagal appearing as Chuck's pool boy.

5. Chuck once hurt his hand during a workout on the Total Gym. In a fit of rage, he broke the machine in half using a single knife edge chop. Then, even more furious over destroying such a great piece of equipment, Chuck was forced to kick his own butt.",1139011200,7,1487,4.277580071174377

-Chuck Norris counted to infinity - twice.

Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn't stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.

2259898,1,B0008KLVB4,"That was a classic moment, where Walker's Cherokee roots and well-tuned sense of taste came in handy. Yes, he actually tasted that a plane had crashed there. How, the hell, was that possible? Seriously. Only on Walker: Texas Ranger.

This show was extremely cheesy. Now, don't get me wrong, Norris is tough; he can fight like no other. But all of that ""coolness"" goes away once he opens his mouth, and the camera focuses on him long enough for the viewer to see his mullet. Walker is too much of a nice guy. Everything he says is corny.

The show's corniness transcends to a state of absolute hilarity in the long run. If anyone saw Conan O'Brien's ""walker texas ranger"" lever bit, it was by far the funniest thing I have ever seen on Conan. You can get to it by going to this URL:

2259901,5,B0008KLVB4,"I remember way back, when I was just a little tike flipping through the channels frantically, trying to find a good program to watch. It was in that moment I stumbled across a Greek God. His shimmering red mullet and overly sized cowboy hat brought immediate attention, and urged me to stop and watch. I quickly noticed the superior acting skills he possessed, the way he carried himself on stage was almost fictitious. It was the next 5 minutes that took place that hooked me for life. Walker kicked down a door and preceded to roundhouse kick at least 20 maybe even 30 drug dealers with ease and grace. He then ran and got the kidnapped kid and jumped out of a window with him in his arm why'll the warehouse ignited in flames after a bomb just erupted. It was poetic television like this that has hooked me to watch ""Walker Texas Ranger"" day in and day out. Give the man a damn noble peace price, he deserves it!",1133395200,,915,4.3882352941176475
2259902,1,B0008KLVB4,"Yes. That's right. Soon they will probably release all the Walker episodes on DVD and these episodes, released as season 8 or 10, will have all the extras, out-takes, promos, interviews, gag reels, documentaries, etc. etc. etc. Just the idea alone that the box has no season number on the side is enough to make anyone collecting the series sick.  This was done because I don't think that the Norris production company even knows which season the last season was as their is some question as to if the first three episodes were a separate season, part of the first season, or just aired pilot episodes. Anyway, there would be no way in hell they could get away with releasing the first three episodes as season #1.

There is a huge problem with releasing the entire run of Walker: Texas Ranger in volumes. When the series originally debuted as a summer series it was suppose to run for several episodes. But Norris, who produced the show himself, ran through the budget halfway through episode #3. Asking CBS for more money to finish the season, instead he was only given enough to finish the third episode in post and the three were aired. When the ratings proved good CBS ordered more episodes giving Norris a chance to finish the initial summer season and continue it to the end of the year.

The first season mess aside, The season before the last season is something else that could be a problem. Problem #1, there is a crossover episode with ""Martial Law"" where part one takes place on the series ""Martial Law"" and part two takes place on ""Walker: Texas Ranger"". [ This is also a problem for Martial Law should they ever decide to release them on DVD. ] The other is the spin off series ""Sons of Thunder"" which replaced Walker for a few weeks, although walker did make many guest appearances as well as the SOT cast showing up on many episodes of W:TR. When CBS reran some of the Sons of Thunder episodes they were retitled as Walker: Texas Ranger. Norris's production company must now decide if those episodes count as a different series or now as sub episodes of the Walker series.

And then there is those TV movies with Walker which may or may not count as episodes. No wonder they simply released the last season instead of trying to figure out the mess of the seasons before.

Perhaps another reason why this season was chosen was the addition of Nia Peeples to the cast. Sadly, in the last couple of seasons Chuck Norris was in his 60's and could not physically carry the episodes anymore. So new characters were introduced to do much of the legwork, and bar fights, that Walker usually did. It was his age that finally convinced Norris to end the series after 8 years. In an amazing wrap-up episode they were even able to bring back a long dead character, CD Parker.  Noble Willingham had played the role for six years but left the series to run for congress. As he was campaigning his characters absence was explained as ""Away on a fishing trip"". When he won his congressional seat and was not coming back, they decided to end one of the episodes with Walker getting a letter saying that CD had died in his sleep, and the character was buried. In the last episodes of the series ""The final showdown prts 1 & 2"" The villains not only hunt down all the rangers but let walker know that CD did not die of natural causes but was poisoned, giving Walker a huge motive for revenge. The episode also saw the birth of Walkers daughter as well as flashbacks showing the fate  of Hayes Cooper [ Walkers alter ego from 100 years earlier ]

And then they decided to make a TV movie, ""Trial by fire"" which ends with a cliffhanger. That suggests a new season of Walker, which means this box set is not really the final season after all.",1130025600,9,3737,4.493372606774669
2259903,5,B0008KLVB4,"I'll be completely honest that I never watched Walker: Texas Ranger while it was airing new episodes. I've caught a few here and there of course, but never took the show seriously. I had 2 weeks of vacation, and for some reason my mother had this collection sitting in with her dvd collection. She said that she never watched it. I was at a loss as to why she'd spend money on it. Then I put in the first disc. 3 days later I had watched them all. I was honestly moved by a few episodes. This series was entirely overlooked, and thanks to this collection, I am a Walker fan. I seriously hope that  the previous seasons are all released in the near future.",1130025600,18,655,4.24

In typical Chuck Norris fashion there are great fight scenes, great camaraderie among the cast, and he always brings back old tv and movie actors and actresses that either played in his old movies or others you haven't seen in a while.

(For those how don't know, the first season had only 4 shows, so some like to not count it as a seasons. So this is why we get people calling it the 8th or 9th season set.)

2259909,5,B0008KLVB4,"Look, while this show was not the best on TV, it was good. You have to give Chuck credit for doing something right. The show lasted more than six seasons. Isn't that saying something? Most TV shows don't even last half a season these days. And if you're wondering, ""J.J."", half of a season is (13) episodes. Chuck went over (100) episodes. I guess, it was a bad show, eh ""J.J.""? Now, I'm not slammin' you, by any means, but give the guy a break. Chuck did his best for almost eight years. And yes, alot of his fight scenes were actually not him. (Which would probably explain the ""famous roundhouse kick"" not seeming like smooth Chuck Norris style.) Sorry Chuck, but it was noticable a couple of times. Anyway, don' t you think that after 5 to 7 years, Mr. Norris earned the right not to do some of his fight scenes? Well, I hope they release the complete series. And for those ""J.J.'s"" out there, if it's really that bad for you,  when you seen the DVD's on the shelf, keep walking...",1123545600,5,985,4.353260869565218

First of all, on the back of the first DVD case. the first four

episodes have the number mislabeled as episode number 1,3,4,2. The

episodes themselves are right but the numbers are mistyped.

Second of all, I noticed all of the episodes are labelled as Episode

801, 802, 803,...823. However, isn't the last season Season 9? All the

episodes are the last season's, but they're labelled as season 8.

2259918,5,B0008KLVB4,Walker Texas Ranger was  great for the simple reason that Chuck did not do a lot of preaching about good versus evil. He and his allies just handled it. There were times when it looked like the bad guys would carry the day but Walker and Trivett kicked butt and took names. I cannot wait to own the entire series on DVD cause lets face it folks too many of todays shows like Friends and Sex and the City lack real substance. Walker had substance and more. It was a modern Gunsmoke except in this Gunsmoke Miss Kitty married her marshall.,1119484800,13,537,4.316831683168317

What I mean by that is is that the show uses very little foul language and has very little, close to no sexuality.",1119139200,3,420,3.8488372093023258

Sure, Walker doesn't have the best graphics or fight scenes that our ""newer"" movies have, but it is still a great series. Walker focuses around the sense of family, companionship, and justice. If you can find a better group of actors that work this well together and believe in their show and cause, well, good luck.

2259922,5,B0008KLVB4,"The reviews of Walker seem to fall into two categories; those who flat out love the show on its own merits, and those who think that it is a classic for sheer awfulness. I happen to belong to the first category, with one caveat; I come to the show looking for more of the same kind of action that typified American martial arts movies in the 1980's. Nobody is ever going to mistake Chuck Norris for Peter O'Toole, but on the other hand O'Toole wouldn't have made a particularly convincing action hero. even his Lawrence was a plotter and a talker, not a fighter.

Nobody who calls Walker 'the worst television show' has ever seen a real turkey (like My Mother The Car, for example). And nobody who says that Norris is a dead awful actor has seen many really bad films .... or many of the '80's karate flicks either. Among the chop-and-kick crew from that era, Norris does rather well ...  which is why he had a career rather than a handful of films descending from theatrical release to direct-to-video. Few Karate/Kung-Fu actors really act very well. Jet Li is learning, Chow Yun Fat is an actor first, Jackie Chan is a clown first and an actor second. The rest of the Honk Kong fraternity don't strike me as better than Norris. On our side of the pacific the only actor who really did both well was Brandon Lee. Seagal is a ham, Van Damn is about on Norris's level, and nobody else spring to mind. As for Norris in this show, well .... Walker doesn't stretch him much, which is good ... he didn't deal well with being stretched beyond a certain point. Instead the show plays to his strengths; a reasonably solid b-actor range, and physical action.

This isn't Law and Order. It isn't subtle at all. Subtle is fine in its place, but when you want to cheer on the good guys and boo the bad guys, Walker fits the bill to a ""T"".",1118793600,,1826,4.380530973451328
2259923,4,B0008KLVB4,"Walker: Texas Ranger was one of my favorite shows when I was younger. Somehow I was able to overlook all the ridiculous and improbable events and enjoy it on a purely serious level.

Nowdays, the hammy acting and storylines overshadow any serious impact the show could have on me, but I still think it's great fun to watch. It has a lot in common with the 50s serials, where the hero gets into terrible, hopeless situations and then escapes without a scratch.

Help's  (Dionne Warwick's)  grand  daughter  get  through  her  surgery  when  they  must  replace  her  liver.

Gage  &  Sydney  you  do  kind  of  wish  they  had  come  earlier  on  in  the  series.  They  definitely  add  action  to  the  show,  &  makes  the  rangers  that  much  more  powerful.  They  all  face  their  own  obstacles,  Gage  loses  his  hearing,  &  in  the  episode  (Blood Diamonds)  Walker  is  wounded  &  clinging  to  life,  &  recording  a  story  to  tell  the  jury  if  he  comes  out  alive,  as  we  find  out  at  the  end  Alex  is  just  dreaming.  &  Walker  &  the  team  learn  CD's  death  was  not  accidental.
You  won't  want  to  miss  the  final  season.  It  is  a  must  have  for  anyone  who  craves  the  action  (Chuck Norris)  brings  to  the  screen,  Still  don't  understand  why  they  have  to  slow  motion  their  kicks.
