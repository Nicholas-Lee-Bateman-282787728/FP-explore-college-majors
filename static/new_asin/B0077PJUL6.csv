8511876,5,B0077PJUL6,ANOTHER DVD THAT I HAD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD AND IT TOPPED MY EXPECTATIONS,1391817600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8511877,2,B0077PJUL6,Most interesting item in either disc was the cigerette ads.  Easy to see how companies hid the truth.  Not really worth the money,1389312000,,129,4.565217391304348
8511878,5,B0077PJUL6,"I've been a Jack Benny fan for a number of years, and grew up watching Johnny Carson's monologues (that's the latest my dad would let me stay up!), and having this collection is amazing. Being able to watch these two as they developed through their early performing years has been a magical treat.",1384646400,,297,4.622641509433962
8511879,3,B0077PJUL6,"A bit disappointing, as I thought this was Carson on the "":Tonight Show.""  It covers his TV experience on small shows prior to the ""Tonight Show.""
All footage is B/W, both Benny and Carson.  If you're in for how television once was, then you'll like this.",1364083200,,255,4.521739130434782
8511880,1,B0077PJUL6,"Terribly dated, very disappointed, any watched two shows and could not stand more of jack Benny. Hoping Johnny will be better.",1362268800,,126,5.0476190476190474
8511881,5,B0077PJUL6,"Jack Benny and Johnny Carson are my 2 favorite comedians of all time. This set contains some of the most hilarious shows you'll ever see, and includes many other comedians from the 1950's, such as Milton Berle and Arthur Godfrey. Some of the material is very old, so don't expect the best quality on all of the discs. What's lacking in video quality is more than made up for in content. I found it hard to believe that this set actually existed, and am ecstatic with the material it contains. There's an astounding 41+ hours of entertainment included at a ridiculously low price. This collection deserves more than 5 stars.",1351641600,11,623,4.672727272727273
