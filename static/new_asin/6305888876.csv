7896919,4,6305888876,"This movie doesn't seem to get the attention that some of Sammo's earlier films garner, but don't let that fool you.  This film has some of the most remarkable old-school fight scenes you will ever witness.  And plenty of them.
The plot involves a clever gimmick-- Sammo Hung (sword) and Lau Kar Wing (spear) play two aging weapon masters with a friendly rivalry spanning decades.  Unable to determine who is the stronger in their annual sparring matches, they decide to take on disciples and have them fight it out to see which style is truly the best.  Their disciples?  Young Lau Kar Wing (sword) and Sammo Hung (spear).  The training sequences are lengthy and entertaining, with each master/disciple pairing trying to sabotage the other.  Meanwhile, a deadly villian (with henchmen in tow) from the masters' past shows up to get revenge.
Comedy abounds and often falls flat-- with the lion's share of the blame falling on the head of Dean Shek Tin, irritating as always with his poor man's Jerry Lewis schtick.  The fighting, however, is as consistently good as any you'll see, and often cited as a masterpiece of combat with weapons.  Sammo is in top form, and it was a nice touch to showcase the two stars with each of two weapons.
Please note that I can't vouch for the quality of this release-- I saw a Japanese edition with subtitles and excellent picture quality.",1060041600,,1373,4.7594936708860756
