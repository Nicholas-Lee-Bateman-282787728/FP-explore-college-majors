6255952,5,B00IAV08DK,Absolutely a wonderful performance with a dynamic cast! Everything was stunning about this production especially the amount of talent! They truly captured the essence of the music! I highly recommend!,1395792000,4,200,5.7
6255953,5,B00IAV08DK,Good to see the bluray version out. No real explanation as to why Amazon didn't have it when the DVD came out. A wonderful production.,1395792000,4,134,4.4
6255954,5,B00IAV08DK,"This is the operatic version, as complete as you will find it.  Unfortunately, it seems that Porgys goat-driven cart has gone the way of the Dodo, as in Rattles version, but in every other respect this is an infinitely superior rendition of A much neglected and maligned American opera.  Afro-Americans complain about its portrait of blacks, while South Carolina has made it its state opera!  However, the music will endure forever, and no one seems to realize the Gershwins expressly stated its performers had to be black, which was anathema in 1935 in this country ((read the very informative Wikipedia article).  And by the way: that much touted 1959 version was a thorough fake, for the principals were lip-synching to other peoples singing voices.  Here you get a superb cast, a glorious production and taut conducting, plus a whole second record of extras.  I saw both the Houston and Met productions, which have not surfaced in DVD format.  Thus, this is the one to have (I loathed the Rattle travesty).",1395792000,5,1010,4.905882352941177
6255955,5,B00IAV08DK,"Eric Owens is an extraordinary Porgy in what is, over all, a fine production of this great American opera.  Its only competition is the old Glyndebourne DVD, but fine as that is in many ways, it is essentially a movie, with the singers in a studio lip-syncing to a prerecorded sound track.  This new San Francisco Opera version was recorded live before an audience and thus has far greater theatrical impact and is a better representation of the Gershwins' work.  My only caveat is that a blu-ray version of this performance should be available soon, as it has already been announced on the publisher's web site (euroarts.com) and indeed by Amazon's British affiliate (Amazon.co.uk).",1394409600,24,683,4.973684210526316
6255956,2,B00IAV08DK,"Forgive my ignorance, though I've watched many productions of Porgy and Bess, including live shows or on DVDs, it's the first time I saw Bess portrayed as red-headed woman. I found Bess (by Laquita Mitchell) in red wig and the nearly exposed big breasts in almost every of her scenes really distracting. The only redeeming quality of this production is Eric Owen, but even so it's not enough to save it and to have me watch this production ever again.",1453420800,,451,4.65
6255957,5,B00IAV08DK,I was singing Summertime for 3 days after watching this performance. Thank you San Francisco Opera.,1448409600,,99,5.25
6255958,4,B00IAV08DK,Disc quality was very good but the performance was not to my liking. Opera singers doing what was essentially a broadway production does not jell. I had trouble following what was being sung and if I did not know the score I would have been lost.,1441152000,2,246,4.369565217391305
6255959,5,B00IAV08DK,"Well performed by a first-class opera company, director and orchestra. The singers are top-notch as well.
The recording is very good as would be expected.",1440547200,,154,5.2
6255960,5,B00IAV08DK,I LOVE IT.,1434931200,,10,2.6666666666666665
6255961,5,B00IAV08DK,I saw this performance on pbs. Best version I've ever seen. Thanks  Cym Fogg,1434585600,,76,4.428571428571429
6255962,5,B00IAV08DK,Wonderful cast and beautiful vocals.,1432944000,,36,6.4
6255963,4,B00IAV08DK,Good performance but sound track was inadequate.,1429142400,,48,6.0
6255964,5,B00IAV08DK,"This is definitely the best ""Porgy and Bess"" on DVD I have seen.  All of the vocalists are really great.  I especially like Eric Owens as Porgy and Karen Slack as Serena. (She brings down the house when she sings ""My Man's Gone Now."") Even though there are some cuts from the original production, they are not really necessary since Gershwin's music is there in its full glory!  I have seen the Houston Grand Opera production and the one with Audra McDonald (sorry that that one exists!!), but this live performance is so well done, I could watch it over and over. I think the scene switches are very innovative and shortening the opera from 3 to 2 acts is very helpful time wise. I also have the blu-ray version which is so crisp. This is one of the greatest productions of a great American grand opera and it is highly recommended for anyone!",1424390400,11,844,4.467532467532467
6255965,5,B00IAV08DK,"Thank you San Francisco Opera  and Amazon.com for making this wonderful opera available to everyone not just a select few.  Amazon.com, maybe you can talk Pacific Northwest Ballet into doing the same with Maurice Sendak's Nutcracker.",1420243200,4,233,5.444444444444445
6255966,5,B00IAV08DK,Wonderful performance,1417996800,,21,10.0
6255967,5,B00IAV08DK,I have always loved the music of Porgy and Bess but had previously been disappointed with the stage musical performances. To see it as a true opera is a dream come true. There may be a few weak spots but overall this is a wonderful production. Well worth having in my opera collection.,1417910400,3,285,4.39622641509434
6255968,5,B00IAV08DK,"Do yourself a favor and watch this.  It is thrilling and heart warming.  I first saw it on PBS in October 2014, and promptly ordered it on DVD, even though I had it recorded on my Tivo, I wanted a more solid copy so I couldn't accidently lose it.  I will definitely be watching this production many times.",1416873600,4,305,4.224137931034483
6255969,5,B00IAV08DK,"The staging, the music, the over-all effect of this rendition is true to the spirit and the intent of the production by George and Ira.  I loved it!",1416873600,2,148,4.285714285714286
6255970,1,B00IAV08DK,This is the worst version of Porgy and Bess that I have seen. There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters. Good voices but they seem to be singing just to try and get the notes out as best as possible. Watch the original or the Simon Rattle version but please skip this one!,1416096000,,293,4.25
6255971,5,B00IAV08DK,Great rendition of this wonderful opera.,1414972800,,40,5.833333333333333
6255972,5,B00IAV08DK,What a great performance!  The blu ray version brings highly realistic sight and sound to this classic American opera.  The music replays in my mind long after listening!  Highly recommended.,1414627200,7,191,5.3
6255973,5,B00IAV08DK,what can I say?  It's Porgy and Bess!  Enough said.  :),1413676800,,55,3.8181818181818183
6255974,4,B00IAV08DK,"The music is top quality, but I couldn't understand the sung dialogues.  My audience enjoyed the list of popular songs, which I showed in lieu of the whole opera.  Ann Leisawitz",1412985600,,177,4.67741935483871
6255975,5,B00IAV08DK,Wow! Performance and blu ray quality beyond perfection.,1412640000,,55,6.0
6255976,2,B00IAV08DK,"This was just plain dull.  Eric Owens was great.  The two stars are for him (but could give him at least 4).  Saw a production at the Met several years ago that was much, much better.  Complete with Navy goat pulling the cart as Porgy headed out to get Bess.  Understand that of course the sets would be simpler in S.F.O. but no excuse for the stage director.  Chorus also good. Would not recommend except for Owens.",1406937600,2,416,4.337662337662338
6255977,2,B00IAV08DK,This P&B showed what is bad about much of Opera today.  There  were far too many on stage to the point that is was difficult to understand the words.  Those extra chorus members cost money!  Porgy was upright which is common today.  Having him in a cart is very effective and makes the final scene powerful.  That final scene was changed as I read with Porgy throwing away his cane.  I can;t tell from memory since I couldn't continue to the end.,1400976000,2,446,4.365853658536586
6255978,5,B00IAV08DK,"I found this version of Gershwin's opera thoroughly compelling and enjoyable. Eric Owens as Porgy and Laquita Mitchell as Bess are completely convincing. Thoughts from David Gockley, General Director of the San Francisco Opera, and members of the cast, as bonus documentaries, are valuable assets. I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone.",1400284800,5,351,5.4
6255979,1,B00IAV08DK,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS PRODUCTION, BUT BASED ON THE EXPLANATIONS I QUESTION THE RETITLING.

Listed on Amazon as THE GERSHWIN'S PORGY AND BESS indicates that this is the NEW bowdlerized, re-thought out version that was recently done on Broadway with Audra McDonald.  That production is touring the US (as of May 2014 it is in L.A.) and I don't believe the SF version is the same.  By calling it THE GERSHWIN'S PORGY AND BESS is confusing.  Only the new version has felt it necessary to let the audiences know that Gershwin is part and parcel of the production.  Would someone please explain why a different version is being hawked as the NEW version.  THANKS.",1400198400,4,656,4.660869565217391
6255980,5,B00IAV08DK,"Porgy and Bess is Puccini's last opera that he didn't compose.  It has all the melody, jazz harmony and dramatic action that is the essence of great art.  It is sad that Gershwin died so young, what more could have been composed to enlighten our lives.  Maybe a violin concerto for Heifetz",1400112000,,289,4.519230769230769
6255981,4,B00IAV08DK,This is truly a great American opera. It should be shown in opera houses all over the world! Very enjoyable to watch.,1399420800,2,117,4.363636363636363
6255982,5,B00IAV08DK,I thought the whole thing was wonderful.  The hit tunes I have known all my life.  So it was wonderful to finally see the whole musical.,1399248000,3,136,4.1923076923076925
6255983,5,B00IAV08DK,"Everything seems Ok in this edition. So, look, listen and enjoy; don't need to recomend nothing more . . . . .",1399248000,,110,4.045454545454546
6255984,5,B00IAV08DK,"If you need to see Porgy and Bess the way it was meant to be seen this is the version you must have.
Blue Ray makes it even greater.",1396915200,4,132,3.586206896551724
6255985,5,B00IAV08DK,"The original version of this opera of 1935 given at Carnegie Hall extended to some four hours which was considered too long even though in every other respect it was greeted with considerable acclaim. Within ten days, when given its Broadway premier, the opera had been cut by about 45 minutes. Further cuts and replacement of sung recitatives with spoken dialogue followed leading to the 1942 Broadway stage version which, according to the sleeve notes, has been the favoured version ever since (see alternative views in the comments sequence below). The result of that editing and reduction was to change the emphasis of the music from an operatic to a stage show experience.

The new `operatic' version presented on this blu-ray disc was conceived in the middle 1970's and produced at the opera house in Houston. This operatic version restored much of the earlier excised material plus the sung recitatives and re-established the operatic nature of the work. It has been widely admired and appreciated and it is that version that is presented on this disc. At 158 minutes it is still far shorter the original 1935 version but has nevertheless returned to the original operatic concept.

The production is `traditional' and of correct period. There has been no attempt to change the period of the opera and the stage sets are impressively realistic and of considerable scale. The orchestral playing is expert and flexibility has been incorporated to allow the required freedoms essential in the more jazz-inspired sections of the work. This freedom of musical delivery is typical of the whole vocal cast and is a considerable achievement in cross-over stylistic performance.

The vocal cast is, with the exception of the white detective, African-American ethnicity as it should be and the authenticity thus achieved is comprehensively `correct' and adds immeasurably to the impact of the drama. The singing of the whole cast, both soloist and chorus, is of the highest possible standard. The key main players, Eric Owens as Porgy, Laquita Mitchell as Bess, Lester Lynch as Crown, Chauncey Packer as Sportin' Life, Karen Slack as Serena and Alteouise deVaughn as Maria offer completely convincing and compelling stage presence as the drama builds and unfolds while consistently delivering vocal performances of power and accuracy.

There are four bonus documentaries - Meet the Artists; Meet the Director; Meet the Conductor; Reflections from the General Director, David Gockley - run for a total of 29 minutes and focus on the reactions and opinions of the performers and the `creative team. ' These, taken together, offer a completely enthusiastic set of reactions to the current performance that set the scene in both a helpful and informative manner as well as illustrating considerable enthusiasm across the board. These were heard first in preparation for this review. I would suggest that this would be a good approach for most purchasers however familiar they may be with Porgy and Bess.

The actual recording is of a `live' performance and offers excellent camera coverage and high definition imaging throughout. There is a palpable sense of involvement achieved with the action on stage for the viewer. The sound is presented in excellent DTS-HD surround sound as well as stereo. The orchestral and vocal sound is well mixed in a believable acoustic. There are subtitles in five languages. The booklet provides good background, synopsis, track details and cast lists.

I would suggest that this is a very impressive presentation of an immensely important and unique American opera. It is given a performance and recording of such quality that this may well become the new benchmark standard against which future ventures will be judged.

8640513,5,B00IAV08DK,"This has to be the best production of the classic Porgy and Bess. I invited my friends in, and we enjoyed it together.

Porgy and Bess is truly an American Opera. Gershwin borrows from Negro spirituals, folk music, jazz and Ragtime. I even detected some motifs of Jewish origin. It is easy to see why it has stood the test of time.

The roles were filled by strong singers who knew how to interpret the work.",1510704000,2,408,4.355263157894737
