5600241,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Other than Stan Lee, there may not be a more respected and beloved comic book storyteller than Frank Miller.  He has been responsible for some of the greatest plots even conceived, creating Batman: Year One, The Watchmen, and V for Vendetta  just to name a small, select few from his brilliant library of ideas.  Miller is also responsible for bringing the legend of the 300 to comic book form in 1998, which was so remarkable and breathtaking that it was adapted to film in the popular 2007 action flick, 300  starring Gerard Butler.  And, after seven long years, the battle with King Xerxes continues in the epic war continuation, 300: Rise of an Empire.

Directed by Noam Murro and based on Frank Millers yet to be published story, Xerxes  300: Rise of an Empire picks up right where its predecessor left off.  The 300 Spartans have fallen at the hands of the King Xerxes mighty army, and with Leonidas now beheaded, the news of his defeat hits both Sparta and neighboring Athens  led by General Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton).

Several years prior, Themistocles helped lead his democratic nation to a successful defense against the aggressive Persians  even killing the Persian king, Darius (Yigal Naor) in the process.  With his son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), devastated after witnessing the death of his father, he eventually becomes a cold, sadistic king  only surrounding himself with one trusted general, Artemisia (Eva Green).

When Themistocles approaches Leonidas widow, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), she is dismissive and refuses to lend Spartas navy to assist Athens in their upcoming battle with Artemisia.  Hopelessly outnumbered by the Persian navy, the Athens must use their tactical abilities to thwart off the rising threat of Persia or risk becoming slaves under the rising power of King Xerxes.

Obviously, former 300 director Zack Snyder opted to skip out on the chair duties this time around, but remaining as screenwriter and producer instead.  Still, his vision and Frank Millers unique style remain in full-force in the sequel  for anyone wondering whether there would be a drastic change in pace or style.  Directing newcomer Noam Murro does an adequate job with his first major directing duties, yet something tells me anyone that would have been sitting in that choice would have been under the close, watchful eye of Zack Snyder.  However, odds are Snyder was splitting his time with his continued effort to completely screw up the Man of Steel franchise  prepping the eventual sequel, Batman vs. Superman (rumor to loosely be based on The Dark Knight Returns comic series, which was also written by Frank Miller).

The general tone and directly are similar to 300, but Rise of an Empire is still its own original story.  The 2007 flick is certainly an ambitious narrative about defending freedom, but it focuses its story on a close-nit group of individuals as they attempt to do the unthinkable: face down a grand army.  In comparison, Rise of an Empire coincides with the same rationale, but goes about its business in a slightly different setting, featuring characters on multiple ends of the visionary spectrum.  While the first film sticks to a good guy mentality, this new film  which cleverly takes place during the past, present, and future  is far more open to delving into the lives of the villains.

Also much like the first film, the carnage in this sequel is seemingly endless.  Incredibly CGI-heavy battle sequences provide no shortage of death and dismemberment for those of you thirty for violent bloodshed.  Unfortunately, the ridiculously high body count is the major factor that will turn a great many potential moviegoers off to this film.  Make no mistake about it  while 300 is engrained with glorious virtues (the best of intentions), its not a film for children or basically anyone that finds gory scenes difficult to smooch.  Plus, explicit sex scenes and brief glimpses of soldiers pillaging, plundering, and raping innocent bystanders will certainly repulse more than just a few new series onlookers.

Even despite the fact that most of their surroundings are CGI, youd never known it based on the top-notch quality of acting from the films stars  Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton.  No, its not like their performances is acclaim worthy (although an MTV movie award wouldnt be out of the question for best kiss), but at no point will you ever think of their portrayals as cheesy or lackluster  which was often the case in similar period films like The Legend of Hercules or Pompeii.  Together, Green and Stapleton sell their unique predicaments nicely and when they finally meet, the scene is steamy and unmistakably memorable.

Overall, 300: Rise of an Empire is a well thought out, entertaining piece of film.  The parallels of this new chapter will appease the lovers of the first film as it progressing in a similar manner   while also filling in story gaps and adding new characters along the way.  Was another 300 film necessary?  Honestly, probably not  but the first film was so successful at the box office that its surprising that it took this long for a sequel.  With so much going on during that time period, there is plenty of room for more 300-themed sequels in the future, and as long as they maintain this swift style of progression  theres no reason to think another 300 film is on the horizon (especially since the ending of this film is so open-ended).  Yes, the violent overtones and sea of blood are a drawback to the potential growth and appeal of this flick  but if you enjoyed the first film, theres no reason to assume you won't feel the same after witnessing this epic.

GRADE:  B-

5600242,4,B00BEJL6JK,"I went into this movie feeling the effects in 300 were a little over the top and while they didn't ruin the movie for me, I really wanted them to tone this down in Rise of an Empire.

Thankfully, they did!

This movie has a semi parallel timeline to the original and but, it is what the Athens Navy was doing during the same time frame.

The hero in this film is Themistocles and he is more the clever tactician who can fight whereas Leonidas was more the Gladiator whose discipline made him a king of Sparta.  Think of this more like Kirk vs Picard where both were great in their own way.

This movie also gives more of the origin of Xerxes and Artemisia as we learn their backstory and why their vengeance is aimed at Greece.

Overall, I really liked the story and it felt like a much more complete package than the original.  I liked the strategic design to the fight scenes and this is honestly the first of these Greco-Roman Empire movies this year that I've really appreciated.

For those that are concerned with the content...

There's a pretty wild Sex scene in the movie, several exposed breasts and other body parts both male and female.  Also there's a ton of very graphic killings (duh).

If you liked the original, you will love this one and if you were just okay with the original, you still might love this movie.",1393891200,248,1328,4.401639344262295

5600310,2,B00BEJL6JK,"Let me get directly to the point. I am so sick and tired of the effeminate and epicene males of Hollywood, trying to cram their obvious misandry down our throats! To state this in laymen's terms, these self-hating-males mistakenly think that all men want to be dominated by women, just because that's their own weak and spineless desire. What am I talking about? Simple. NO ARMY OR NAVY OF THE MOST VICIOUS WARRIORS IS GOING TO BE LED BY SOME SMALL, SKINNY LITTLE WOMAN!!! GIVE ME A BREAK!!! The very idea that she is suppose to be the lead villain of the movie is just preposterous, even for a fantasy!!! That's not good enough for this womanly-director though. Even the Spartans, the most battle-hardened warriors in Greece, (according this DUMB movie) all stand around and take their orders from the queen of Sparta. SORRY, BUT, I'M NOT BUYING WHAT THEY'RE SELLING!!!

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: For me, watching some 5'5"", 125lb woman ""man-handling"" 6'+, 225lb men, like they're just rag-dolls, is a bridge that is WAY TOO FAR!!! I'm not faulting the female actors; I blame the director. Frankly, I would just love to setup an event where 4 or 5 of these female actors that, in their respective movies, were beating the hell out of dozens of men, AND I'LL FIGHT ALL OF THEM AT ONCE!!! I guarantee I would win.",1520208000,,1311,4.626609442060086

5600417,3,B00BEJL6JK,"The 3D presentation isn't terrible, but if you hold no nostalgia for the first film, this will be hard to sit through. I guess I'll tackle each topic one at a time.

The 3D presentation is fun and helps makes this photorealistic, special-effects fantasy come to life. One gimmick that happens a bit too much is the splattering of precipitation and/or blood on the fourth wall. Used sparingly it could have been fun, but after a while it's a bit too expected and worn out. But there are plenty of great scenes with beaming streams of light, ambient dust and underwater action that look gorgeous. It's not the kind of movie you'd pop on to show off your TV to house guests (find a good bunch of nature documentaries for that), but for an enthusiast of the format, it's among the better presentations in the genre.

The movie itself is absurd, and takes full advantage of its R rating in tasteless ways. If you didn't like the first movie, you won't like this one - and if you did, you still might be disappointed. This one is strictly for those who want more backstory to the original film and a ridiculous conclusion to the story. Casual viewers won't find much here, but die-hard fans with have a good chuckle watching this all unfold. Be warned, it starts out with a solid thirty minutes of exposition.",1502236800,,1303,4.540425531914893

This movie had three buttons: slow mo fight scenes with massive amounts of blood, bombastic invocations of ""freedom"" and ""unity"".

Most people watching this probably have no idea that Sparta was a military dictatorship, and that since all the Spartan men were full time soldiers, all the labor of Sparta was done by a large enslaved Helot population (another Greek people group), whom Spartan men murdered as a right of passage to manhood, and at random to keep them subjugated in terror. In other words, the Spartans were institutional terrorists. So much for freedom of the Greeks! It was the ultimate expression of toxic masculinity.

Rise is a prequel, sequel and side story to the original 300 film from almost 10 years ago.  But it treads a lot of the same ground visually and thematically and while 300 told a classic tale of duty and sacrifice, Rise tells the story of a victory, robbing it of virtually all impact.  No amount of CGI blood or clanging swords could liven up this by-the-numbers story.  And really did we need to see the 'secret origin' of 10' Xerces?

If you have time, rewatch 300, or watch something else.  This movie was unnecessary, pointless and dull.  Spend your time and money elsewhere.",1460764800,4,686,4.44

This movie serves as pro-Western propaganda for the bogus War on Terrorism. This movie continually claims that the Greeks had a democracy, but the fact is that slavery was at least as commonplace in Greece, as it was in Persia. This movie disingenuously shows the Persian galley slaves, but it does not show the Greek galley slaves. The Persians are portrayed as black, cold, and evil, like Tolkein's orcs, while the Greeks are portrayed as warm and human.

In this movie, on of the Greeks says that he is trying to protect Greece against the spread of ""mysticism"". The fact is that the Greek culture was just as ""mystical"" as the Egyptians, Babylonians, Hebrews, Persians, and Indians. The Greeks practiced human sacrifice. The philosophies of Socrates and Plato are largely based on Hinduism.

Even free this would be a stretch to actually finish watching. Paying to see it is foolish. I see allot of 4+ star reviews; I don't think they were watching the same movie I did.

The machismo action is so over-the-top that you can't help but chuckle throughout the movie. I mean, the blood effects actually got worse: strawberry smoothie spews from the Persians with every nick.

The film draws so many parallels between our current ideological wars--Western democratic republicanism vs Middle Eastern totalitarianism--that you'd think Rush Limbaugh helped write the script.

But I have never, ever had more fun at a movie theatre than when I went to watch this film. My friends and I loved the stupidity of this film, laughed our butts off, and came up with countless ridiculous scenarios about where the franchise could go next.

The first 300 can maybe be argued as a respectable, hyperbolic expression of the ancient Spartan mindset. This sequel is just a silly action film to enjoy with your friends. And it did the job wonderfully.",1446076800,,965,5.13375796178344

 - Story didn't have the same clarity and direction as the first 300 film.  Perhaps this is part of the difference between a Spartan and an Athenian but it made the pacing of the movie feel a bit sludgy at times.
 - They stole some of the thunder of the previous film with the additions made to Xerxes story by making him seem less like a psychotic steam roller of death
 - Fight scenes didn't seem to have as much tactical integrity as the previous film... perhaps another difference between Spartans and everyone else?

Praise:
 - Remained true to the overall feel of the previous film
 - Eva Green
 - Even though the situation was certainly less dire for the characters in this movie, you felt the difference in how they confronted the dangers they were facing.  They weren't fearless and you never felt fearless watching this show.",1438819200,,847,4.630872483221476

They did a good job on the back story and the dialog from the Eva Green and Lena Heady were the best written compared to the male counterparts.  The story was close enough to the Herodotus account to be a decent outline of what really happened.  The action sequences of the naval battles were really well done and graphically easy to understand and appreciate.  The blood spattering and other gratuitous sex and violence are overdone as in the first one, but oh well.  On the quality of the 3D blu-ray, that was why I give this only a four star.  the video and cgi were outstanding, but the DTS Master 7.1 surround diminished the center channel vocals so much that I had to double the db settings for that just to get the dialog.  Someone really dropped the ball on the vocals in the mixing room.  Terrible!  The music scores for all the build up to the battle scenes and during the battle scenes was outstanding.  Other than the dialog sound problem, it was worth the $$$.

5601625,2,B00BEJL6JK,"All the budget and production value of the first movie, now with breathtakingly gorgeous 3D, with none of the writing or directorial skill, and absurd strategies (same ones the Persians repeatedly praise as ""clever"", and of course there's the impossibly-angled shot to kill Xerces at the movie's start).

The visual, visceral feel of the movie is fantastic (and it takes plenty of opportunities to congratulate itself by slowing the motion for you to savor longer), but I couldn't watch even half an hour due to the number of times my intelligence was insulted in the dialog, posturing, and worn cliches.

As an example (is it SPOILER to reveal the first five minutes of the film? If so, don't read on I guess): after the impossible shot suffered by Xerces, he's brought back to his kingdom, with the entire arrow shaft still sticking out his chest (what, they can't clip it to reduce the risk of movement?), lying on his death bed. He gives his final words, and Artemisia (how do you make a strong woman character? Give her a rape-survivor backstory. A woman couldn't possibly be strong without that!) plucks out the shaft, and he dies. Excuse me? If that kills him, why not let it stay in a little longer, or at a minimum wait until he's clearly in too much pain to suffer living any longer. Maybe he can just live with the arrow head permanently embedded, as some do with tricky bullet shards.

Okay, so this is Hollywood. Such things are par for the course, and easily forgiven. But my brain receives such a constant pummeling from that point forward, that it never gets a chance to breathe. Ridiculous Xerces origin story (with a trite narrative), an implausible warrior-vet-father-who-won't-let-his-obviously-old-enough-son-fight-while-at-the-same-time-expecting-rest-of-Greece-to-offer-up-their-young-inexperienced-men, and yeah, the ridiculous circle-of-ships strategy Artemesia praised so highly: they keep their ships in a defensive circle, but somehow also ram the Persians from the side at the same time. How's that done.

Anyway, as awesome as the 3D effects are, I just couldn't keep watching the crap that served as their vehicle, so there you have it.",1432857600,,2167,5.165242165242165

5601771,5,B00BEJL6JK,"This mesmerizing, non-stop, historical action and adventure film with the additive of some dramatic license that was taken, is appropriately intense in it's brilliant battle scenes which are full of extreme violence, excessive bloodshed and graphic human carnage. Continuing from where the '300' film ended in a brave defeat for a valiant King Leonidas and his courageous 300 Spartan warriors who..., at the narrow pass of Thermopylae, fought to the death in hand-to-hand combat against the thought to be the god-king Xerxes, from Persia. And only lost, due to betrayal by a rejected hunchback, who was one of their own countrymen. This film - RISE OF AN EMPIRE 300, literally starts, where the Battle of Thermophylae in the prequel film - 300, left off. In addition too, a little bit of background history and a new war, with a new hero, emerging. That being, an Athenian, that faced the arrogant god-king within the purifying water of the mighty sea, head-on! Enter, Admiral/General - Themistokles and his Athenian barrages. The big, bad and not so brave Xerxes, preferring to let a woman by the name of Artemisia, a Greek, fight his battles for him while leading the massive Persian ships against the brilliant tactician, Themistokles. Up close and personal battle scenes which rivet ones eyes to the viewing screen. This is history on the big screen as you have never seen it before. It's shocking and compelling and chuck full of grotesque violence, bloodshed and sexual nudity and it's expression, thereof. Thus making it a film for mature audiences, only. Historical, graphic, violent and extremely intense but also appropriate, considering the subject matter. Because war and battles of any kind, are hardly..., pretty or pleasing to behold.

5601775,2,B00BEJL6JK,"Did you see the original 300? Well this is essentially more of the same. Instead of a romanticized story based on a historical battle with 300 Spartans this is a romanticized story of a historical battle by the Greeks in the same war with Persia. You have the same bravado, same violence, same visual and cinematic style and even the same costume style. Both movies are interchangeable. However for the most part the original 300 film is far superior. Not just because it was first, but also because certain design changes and embellishments made on Rise of an Empire less effective stylistically. Also it doesn't make any attempt to really move past certain tropes that worked the first time, but in the second time around they are either looking tired or droll.

300: Rise of an Empire chronicles the exploits of Themistocles, a Greek general, and events that happened before, during and after the events from the movie 300. You hear tale of the origin of the god-king Xerxes and why he desires conquering Greece, Themistocles' heroic actions at the battle of Artemisium and Salamis, and how Xerxes' respected naval commander Artemisia rose to power and of her battles with Themistocles. The events in the film are loosely based on actual historic figures and battles, and just like 300 there is a lot of artistic license being used to liven up the events.

When I saw 300 in the theaters I knew what I was walking into, but was so impressed by the visual style that it was easy to forgive some of the more annoying aspects of the film. It just feels like this time style over substance isn't enough. For one the style isn't exactly the same, and the changes made don't do the movie any favors. The first movie had lots of violence, but it was portrayed artistically and moved more like a ballet. With Rise of an Empire it was decided to increase the graphic realism I suppose. Buckets and buckets of CGI blood are bathed in almost every scene in the movie. And unlike the painted strokes seen in the previous movie this blood is all drippy and splattering (and everywhere) in spite of the fact it's is obviously computer generated. This focus on the gore in this way does a lot to cheapen this film, and make it less a stylized and almost artsy action flick like 300 and puts it more into the realm of a cheesy snuff film.

If blood were the only problem... no the blood is a big, unrealistic turn off. However there is more misfires than just that. Like I said before this movie feels like a rehash. Themistocles is Leonidas in almost every way. His soldiers dress the same as the Spartans, grunt battle chants the same, and fight almost the same way as well. This is a real conceit because in 300 Leonidas made it a point to mention Greek soldiers are part time warriors and Spartans are all soldier, yet here these craftsmen and farmers by trade kicking butt just as well. I admit Themistocles is the best butt-kicker of the bunch, and he is a full time military man, but still the difference between 300's ""brave amateurs"" and what we see here are striking.

And don't get me started about the the endless parade of rousing speeches in this film. Just about all of them sound like hollow talking points. ""...unbreakable bond made stronger by the crucible of combat"", ""...they fear our freedom"", ""It is a wind of freedom! A wind of vengeance."" I swear you can play a drinking game for every time they spout out the words freedom, glory, blood and so forth. With 300 there were speeches like these, and they were just as cheesy, but then there were some decent displays of bravado that Rise of an Empire completely lack. Oh yeah... and I don't get the title of this picture. 300: Rise of an Empire is not about any empire rising to power. So the title is misleading at best.  There is also the attempt to keep the stylized camera work where certain action scenes are slowed down then sped back up again as well as other things like that CG painted backdrop look and overall filtering. Again this all doesn't hold the same bite as before.

Still 300: Rise of an Empire isn't all bad. You get good performances from Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green. Sullivan doesn't have the same poise that Gerard Butler had, but he does portray that dedication you expect from a legendary hero. Eva plays Artemisia with both a gleeful sadism that's chews up the scenery and some surprisingly subtle expressions denoting more going on than just what's on the surface. This helps dampen out the  off-period wardrobe her character often wears. As much as Rise of an Empire is inferior to the original 300 it does still have many moments that are pure eye candy. That can't be denied. Also the introduction of more refined battle tactics does give this movie a notch up from the hack and slash of the previous movie. So as much as I didn't enjoy the movie overall there were plenty of moments that make me almost... just almost... give this movie a pass.

The video is top notch and in full 1080p. With all the details in the cinematography and the dynamic color palette his can very well be a reference level disc when it comes to testing visuals. Audio is the same way with the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 taking a lot of use from the satellite speakers. A bit overdone at times, but again it makes a great reference disc. You also get Dolby Digital 5.1 in Spanish, French and Portuguese along with subtitles. The extras are surprisingly good, and do a lot to make this disc a worthwhile buy. Here's the list:

Behind the Scenes: The 300 Effect - Four making-of featurettes running at a half hour total go into the production of the movie. The four segments are  Three Days in Hell, Brutal Artistry, A New Breed of Hero and Taking the Battle to Sea.

Real Leaders & Legends - This is the real gem of the extras. It's a comparison between the movie and the actual historical events they are based on. It makes for an honest and informative little documentary that would feel just right on the History channel.

Women Warriors - A shorter featurette showcasing the two female leads in the film. It's a nice reminder to a testosterone filled movie that girl power isn't something to be trifled with.

Savage Warships  - Another great featurette that taps into the real history of the battles and shows the technology and tactics behind the naval warfare of the ancient Greeks. It's just a little over ten minutes long, but it's got a lot of fascinating information.

Becoming a Warrior  - Behind the scenes with the actor training for the roles they do in the film.

300: Rise of an Empire ultimately didn't impress me. There was some potential to stand out, but instead the movie took the approach of aping the first film more than it should have. Don't get me wrong. I may have not liked it overall, but you might. If the action and bravado of 300 is all you really care for you will get plenty of it here to love along with lots of animated blood and gore, partial nudity and some origin stories. If you demand more than a rehash film you may want to leave this film as a rental.",1429142400,,7062,4.530612244897959

5601861,5,B00BEJL6JK,"Excellent action, combat, adventure historical movie about ancient Greece.

 ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is an outstanding sequel to the remarkable ""300 Spartans"" epic film based on a comic book graphic novel, and real history.
 This addition follows the Athenian Naval side of that same historical invasion by the ancient Persian expeditionary forces against the Greek city states.

We have the beautiful and amazing Eva Green as ""Artemnesia"", the woman commander of the Persian Navy and Marine forces.  Green absolutely steals the show as a dynamic, powerful, and intensively sexual and physical combatant presence leading her men into combat along with slaughtering all who get in her way.  Green's character mentally manipulates and negatively alters the mind of the Persian prince whose dying father warns him to leave the Greeks alone, and just take the losses of the original battle.  Because his mind has been poisoned by Artemnisia's tactical manipulations, he becomes a Persian ""God King"" setting his empire outward on a mission of conquest and destruction.

 On the Athenian side, we have the noble Sailor and Political statesman Themistacles, who tries to convince the Athenians, along with the Spartan Queen played again by ""Game of Thrones"" & ""Terminator Sarah Conner"" actress Lena Hadey, to join in an alliance of defense against Persia's aggression.  Themistacles then finds himself leading his Marines and Sailors into direct combat with Eva Green's forces at sea.

 300 again reminds viewers the cost of human freedom and real justice is painful, bloody, and very high where no nation can survive appeasing rouge actors in this world.  Military action can only be justified when a country has to fight, and fight Themistacles does showing a lot of balls and heart through out this epic.  He is not completely corrupted by the sexual dynamic prowess of Green, and her stunning beauty, for even when he engages in a sexual encounter with her he realizes who he is and that no promise no matter how grand, nor any desire he has for sex can replace the value of people living in a free country.

 This man struggles with the loss of his own Sailors, his friends, the burning of his city state with the slaughter of civilians and the rape of women, along with the realization that he knows his strategy is correct but many unfortunately had to suffer until the other Greeks got the hint.

 Very violent, not for young kids nor for people whose brains are on the ""Barney-Disney"" level, action driven blood bath combat epic of the most grand and visually remarkable piece of art.

Very rated R, NOT politically correct, but because the historical subject matter (vitally serious lesson that STILL pertains to us all in the modern world).  Just like Hanks's ""Saving Private Ryan"" / ""American Sniper"" / Gibson's ""Braveheart"" / ""2004's King Arthur"" & other films with a similar message I probably would have most teenagers see it, because this story is important.  Very few movies teach us the lessons history has for mankind, so when a work of art like this comes along I place the work on the top of the entertainment value list.

I never felt once despite the modern extravagant special effects that this movie was so called ""violence & sex porn"" because it isn't, this was raw warfare with heroic people defending their country & freedom.  The movie artfully portrays the real brutal ancient world, and our modern world has a lot to thank the ancient Greeks for.

These actors really went out of their way to make a spectacular motion picture, two thumbs way up and A+ for both of these awesome ""300 Spartan"" movies.

Peace at all costs through out the dark and bloody history of man is a delusion, because there will ALWAYS be a violent and ruthless force of thugs / scumbags who will threaten the peace of the innocent (as long as human beings are alive on this Earth man will change little).

5601877,4,B00BEJL6JK,"I was surprised that I thought this movie was at least as good as, if not better than, the first in some respects.  What we lost in characterizations of the Greek warriors, we made up for in learning about the origins of Xerxes and Artemisia (more interesting than watching Xerxes huff and puff with no explanation or history whatsoever).  The battle strategies seemed more varied (for being limited to the ocean), the fight scenes seemed slower and longer with more focus on detail, and the music was far more epic and inspiring (if a tad repetitive).  I also thought the ending (SPOILER ALERT) was more satisfying, with the implication that this time the Spartans completely stomped out the Persians (not a history buff, but there are several historian accounts sometimes supporting and sometimes refuting the movie included in the special features, which were very interesting).

But the purpose of this review is the 3D aspect.

It began very promisingly.  The opening scenes looked outstanding, on a par with Star Trek: Into Darkness and (nearly) Avatar (my current two gold standards).  And this quality held up more or less throughout the whole movie.  With all the arrows being aimed, spears being hurled and swords being thrust, no opportunity to enhance with 3D was squandered, and they all looked fantastic.

My only complaint came in during the first naval battle, where I noticed a faint gauzy haze on the screen.  Not as noticeable in 2D, but sadly the 3D puts it right in the foreground and makes it almost the only thing you can see.  I thought the problem was with my glasses, which I cleaned thoroughly, but it improved when they were on land and returned once again for the next battle.  If this was the film makers' attempt to make it look like they were actually out at sea, that idea sounds good on paper but in actuality marred every scene that takes place on the water.  And, guess what, this movie is all about battles on the water.

I will say from the tiny bit of footage that appears to be from the first movie (either re-shot or salvaged from the cutting room floor), I really wish they'd put out 300 in 3D format, because that looked amazing as well.

If you're into 3D, this is certainly worth checking out.  I just wish the director had gone with a bit less of a ""realistic"" approach for a film where we don't really expect absolute veritas.",1426032000,2,2373,4.668269230769231

5602058,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Historical accuracy be darned, 300:  RISE OF AN EMPIRE is a graphic novel brought to heart-pounding life much like its stimulating predecessor.  The story is told via gorgeous vistas, slow motion photography, driving music, chiseled bodies, gratuitous violence, and spewing gore.  In this version, Athenian muscle man Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) leads the tiny Greek Navy against the mighty Persian fleet, led by the stunning, but deadly Artemisia (a gorgeous and sensuous Eva Green).  The action sequences are frantic, to say the least, and in this version the filmmakers have ratcheted up the gore.  But like its predecessor, it realizes its purpose is to entertain, so it never takes itself seriously.

And is it fun to watch.

Lena Headey (wolf howl), David Wenham, Rodrigo Santoro, Andrew Tiernan, and Peter Mensah all appear to reprise their roles from the action-packed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B000Q6GX5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>.  Yet this version of 300 is aptly carried by Stapleton and Green, who have terrific chemistry on screen.  300:  RISE OF AN EMPIRE looks and feels like a cartoon, only with live actors.  Here's hoping the talented filmmakers are able to launch a 300 franchise; that's a sequence of films this reviewer would appreciate, plus think of all the Hollywood trainers who would find fulltime work.  Chisel away.

Takes place before during and after the events of 300, you get two (count 'em two) super-vixen women in positions of top power - all hail Eva Green - and the battles while similarly OTT to 300 now include a lot of naval warfare which I always find fun (like the Pirates movies). This is the kind of thing you can watch while working out or drinking some beers with the right group. People who don't like it will REALLY not like it - but if you're my generation and got excited when you first saw Excalibur this is kind of like that on a hundred tons of HGH, minus the wizarding.

Whereas with the original 300 you also had some degree of suspending your disbelief, the story and characters allowed for this... this sequel simply has none of the charms of the original. Themistocles may be the single most interesting character in history (worth a Google), but in this movie he is reduced to a one-dimensional action hero. Not bad in itself, but the actual Themistocles was so much more interesting, and it's just not enough considering the other shortcomings of the movie, to rescue it from the scrap heap of movie history.",1419897600,2,745,4.968

5602192,3,B00BEJL6JK,"The 300 boys are back in a story based on the graphic novel `Xerxes' by Frank Miller and translated into a screenplay by Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad. Israeli director Nam Miller takes over the duties of Zack Synder who directed the initial 300 and in every way the result is better.

Sullivan Stapleton (`Strike Back') takes the lead and handles it well. After its victory over Leonidas' 300 (Gerard Butler), the Persian Army under the command of Xerxes (the very sadly underused fine actor Rodrigo Santoro) marches towards the major Greek city-states. The Democratic city of Athens, first on the path of Xerxes' army, bases its strength on its fleet, led by admiral Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton). Themistocles is forced to an unwilling alliance with the traditional rival of Athens, oligarchic Sparta whose might lies with its superior infantry troops. But Xerxes still reigns supreme in numbers over sea and land - primarily due to the shenanigans of Artemisia (Eva Green). Lena Headley remains onboard as Queen Gorgo of the Spartans, as does David Wenham as Dilios. The story is slight, the blood splashing across the CGI effects-ridden screen is less this time around, every man's pecs are buff (except for the skinny strangely cast Hans Matheson), there is as much sex as can be expected from this group of warriors, and there are a few standout performances, though brief. And there is an embarrassingly weak musical score by Junkie XL.

For lovers of graphic comic novels this is a version of history magnified and brushed with many heads loped off and blood and fires and navy battles. A lot of buff men fill the screen every moment and that seems to be the raison d'tre for the part two of this 300 series. Definitely better than the first and a good diversion - for a holiday weekend.... Grady Harp, December 14",1419724800,,1827,4.852564102564102

You certainly never get bored as every second is filled with something going on, there is certainly more action in this movie with gory bloodthirsty fight after another with limbs and heads flying everywhere and plenty of blood splashing all over the screen, rather allot for a 15 rated movie! There are some very cool scenes filmed on water with epic boats filled with soldiers battling it out to the death, the cast is amazing especially Eva Green who was the best character for me, a very sexy yet black hearted evil woman! Sullivan Stapleton is a cool lead actor not as cool as Gerard Butler but a great actor non the less, Lena Headey is back of course only for a small role but she's great too as usual, The effects this time round have certainly been improved and look great, its just a barbaric spectacle of violence that's really well done all round, if your a big lover of the original its a must of course, lots of fun to be had here and its something well worth going back too again and again!",1419379200,,1382,4.3604651162790695

The overall vibe of the film seemed a bit caustic...which being a fan of the original 300 I somewhat expected, but the violence seemed a bit over-the-top and distracted from the narrative. I was sort of shell-shocked by the end of it, and had somehow completely lost the plot. What brought me back to the film was that I loved the look of it. It was shot in a style very similar to the first one, but I have to say this one is even more impressive. I have found that it still looks stunning even after repeated viewings. But now those images are more meaningful because I completely understand the story arc and how it ties in with the first movie. Truthfully, I can no longer find much about this film worthy of a complaint. No...it is not the greatest motion picture ever made. But it is a great Fantasy/Action flick with impressive imagery, excellent acting (Eva Green owns this one), a wonderful musical score, and a highly imaginative tie-in to the original film.",1417564800,,1126,4.4975609756097565

5602346,4,B00BEJL6JK,"This film cannot stand alone on it's own unlike films like Terminator 2 or Rambo: First Blood Part II where you don't need the first film. 300 Rise Of An Empire is enjoyable as any expansion pack to a video game you love playing. If you love 300 then you shall enjoy adding this to it however this film will only be necessary if there is a third epic climactic installment. If not then you do not need this, just like any expansion pack where you may enjoy it without the extra bonus content or in this case, story of the stylized fantasy swords and sandals warfare in a period visual opera.

WHAT YOU GET IN THIS EXPANSION PACK:

-A NEW POINT OF VIEW and style of war from the Athenians in this fictional comic book universe. Athenians and Spartans have a different approach to battle and philosophy. This shows more of the naval style as a platform to get the warriors to set up their ships to crash and stage them to hack and slash their enemies. Battle on the waters is a beautiful concept and lots of fun for this film. The water acts as another character for the physical drama. Agian, it works for this is fantasy adventure drama setting. A fantastic dream like sequence of a story. Its great to get a same tone but different style of battles and combat because these are not the Spartans but it is the world of 300 and this shall deliver very well on that.

-BADASS FEMALE WARRIOR VILLAIN, Artemisia played ever so beautifully by Eva Green. (i find her sexier in her battle more than the sex scene not that the sex scene is not hot mind you) They show why and how she becomes to be a force to reckon with. I ended up rooting for her. This is a fantasy story using historical characters for play as if you would pit your Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to take on the Hulk or something. So do not be offended or educated on how things play out but enjoy it, just like the first one. (sorry, getting off topic and possible spoiler). I want more female heroes. I enjoy female roles to be at the same level as the male. We see this woman stand toe to toe on even ground with the hero. They are a great match in battle. Even their attraction with as a strong female antagonist with the strong in body male protagonist is based of rivalry. Like they are destined to clash.

-A KILLER SOUNDTRACK by Junkie XL who if I am not mistaken film has used one of his album songs for when we first saw Blade slice and dice Vampires in the club (Slice & Dice in Da Club would make a great Hip-Hop track...Wu-Tang?) the musical ambience adds an attitude to match the wonderful visuals that 300 had set a standard for and amps up the emotion of battle where some of the actors may be lacking in at times. he uses electronic sound but no beats in any commercial sense with a minimal use of electric guitars. Junkie XL utilizes musical instrument samples for the time and cultures amped up electronically. very fun and is truly an extra actor narrating the film beautifully framing the visuals.

-MORE BACKSTORY OF THE ENEMY you get to see and understand where he comes from and what he is about but nothing to add to his goals, just how he came to be so grand, so God like, so shiny.

-MORE BRUTAL BLOOD SPATTER COMBAT where the blood is now more syrup like instead of cloud evaporating like from 300. Was the hot gates that hot and the ocean being so much colder that you can see the thickness of the blood???? Yeah more CG blood and from the gory movies I've seen I do prefer the actual blood like form Evil Dead 2 and old school Conan The Barbarian. I am glad its war gore since most films are PG-13. Comic Book films for Punisher, The Crow, Conan, etc, must be Rated R to stay true to them. I am praying for Dead-Pool to be R (eh, Disney????) Back on the CG Blood, its worthy because of how they are going for the weapons going through flesh and its thickness they even joke in interviews that the people must have high sodium. I appreciate that. With such enjoyment of making an entertaining visual experience, that is love in filmmaking so thank you.

-A LITTLE YET MORE OF QUEEN GORGO with a nice hint that promises more of her should there be a third film; one that shall not be a DLC Expansion Pack as I am calling this one but an actual epic film to stand on its own.

-MORE ART DIRECTION beautiful new outfits and design of the clothing, more of their fantasy Persia and a few mutated characters. No new weapons though but we see a bit more lands and places. Beautiful...sets? lots of CG backgrounds however I'm a Babylon 5 fan so I am pleased with ambitious artistic treats to the worlds and its not stupid so I'm pleased. The new color template is Blue! The first film we have Red so should their be a new element for the third film i would be expecting Green or Gold. yes, a third film is needed but not another expansion...but back to the topic!!!!....The technical approach to the battles and setting is wonderful. If this matters to you like it does to me, you will enjoy scenes like the moon in the distance so huge and touching the water under a star lit sky. The environment is very beautiful and feels like another world. Since it is not historically accurate, maybe it is being in some alternate universe's history. That's a fun and liberating thought now isn't it?

-GREAT 3D EXPERIENCE film too! I caught it in the theater in 3D, have yet to own my own but they have great use of images in that comic book jump out of the pages feeling so if you rock the 3D entertainment at home, I saw that this does not fail.

-AND they maintain the narrative story book style which is a major plus!

THE GLITCHES IN THIS EXPANSION PACK:

-Themistocles is a passionate gifted warrior who leads his men in the name of Greece with loyalty that will never waiver AND YOU ARE TO ACCEPT THAT. Like classic Superman, he just is and you are not to be given a story as to why he is such a great man but know that he is because he says so, so STFU and watch him kick ass. Like Superman, I like to know how he got there and why he is so. They accomplish that for Artemisia but don't bother for Themistocles. Made me root more for her beautiful character with a powerful back story. Sullivan Stapleton does own this role as he does what his is told sincerely, so it's acceptable but again, I am team Artemisia. He is a great character who is a man of the people in politics not just in battle however we skip all this. If we spent 10 minutes for his passion for the people and his political visionary self would be beautiful for we got that with Leonidas and why they skipped out on this with him is beyond me. Unless they are expecting us to know this then that is an error for this is not based on exact history and even if it was you still must give that to the audience. The actor does believe this backstory and delivers in his performance but it is without narrative.

-Themistocles' homie Scyllias and son of Scyllias. The son's name is not worth remembering and I cannot remember if they even say it for his importance in the film was not matching the previous film's father & son relationship. This son adds nothing to the story, he is just there. If you delete all the scenes with the son of Scyllias speaking, it would be fine and you would not notice a difference except that some dude who attends to Scyllias' wounds decided to try war paint at some point that serves only as cool to put something on the promotional posters. They could have saved money on this role by not having it and perhaps put that money into a backstory for Themistocles as to mirror Artemisia's to build up their fued as this movie is Themistocles VS Artemisia.  Perhaps the son needed his SAG card, then I am for that. bring on new good talent if you are good. That's the only justification I can fathom but other than that, F this character and his face paint.

-EEL SYMBOLISM is something I do not understand granted I have yet to look it up. I only know of Flotsam & Jetsam from The Little Mermaid. Was this...them? Nooooo, couldn't be them....unless they did attack Athenians and one lost it's eye and Ursula saved them and expanded their life? We don't know how old they are or Ursula, do we? Perhaps? Yes, this is random but I am trying to find more of their purpose. I know crows for death and eating the corpse but the sea perhaps has eels. It's either those two eels or a dream. Perhaps this will be explained in the third one. Probably not. Though it was fun to see in 3D. I enjoyed them more than the son of Scyllias that's for sure. It was a good effort though to show monsters since we did see some in 300 and I suppose they wanted to skip a montage of getting from one predicament to the next scene like skipping Themistocles' backstory.

WHY GET THIS EXPANSION PACK?

Again, if you love 300 and want more, this is a good way to go but you do not need it. I love fantasy comic book adventures and action. I'm one who is raised on Conan The Barbarian so I wanted more since I really loved 300. Until there is a third film, you need not have regret if you pass this film. If you love the world, adventure, action and fantasy universe of 300, then get this expansion film pack.",1417219200,,9161,4.286127167630058

Liked it for what history is there and for the cinematics. The VFx are very good and some of the directing, as well as most of the acting, were very good. I hated the scene where Cruella (Artemesia) basically rapes the man. Not only was it unbelievable, but it was overacted and trashy.

SPOILERS:

As for the part where the story ends, it's inaccurate. Artemisia (not Cruella, just made that up) had a much more interesting history. She escaped for her life, following the final battle of defeat and lived to be a woman of old age.",1416700800,,686,4.560975609756097

The Persian king Xerxes did not look or act as depicted; he certainly did not strut around in a bathing suit.
In the film it is ten years after Darius led the first invasion of Persians against Greece. Xerxes, his son, leads the second invasion  not Artemisia, as the film depicts. She was the queen of another kingdom who did not lead the massive naval fleet of Xerxes, but aided Xerxes by giving him only five ships. In fact she persuaded Xerxes to retreat. She also did not have fierce sex with Themistocles as portrayed in the film. She was also not killed by Themistocles as depicted. The true story is in the History of Herodotus.
  But the film is enjoyable as fiction. It is very exciting, and filled with action, blood, and violent death, showing lots of naked or semi naked flesh. The war turned young men into memories.",1416355200,2,1041,4.646739130434782

""Rise"") However, in every other aspect this movie falls way short of its predecessor and begs the question of why the 1% continue to throw it in the faces of the lowly 99- that having all this wealth means that we can make terrible multi-million dollar pictures just for the hell of it!

This is the battle that saved western civilization and the ideas of democracy and the rights of men.  It's one of histories most important.  The movie of course follows frank miller's comics in feel and story.  It's not actual  history but it's sort of like the real thing.  And it's a lot of fun to watch.

5602463,5,B00BEJL6JK,"""300: Rise Of An Empire"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: After its victory over Leonidas' 300, the Persian Army under the command of Xerxes marches towards the major Greek city-states. The Democratic city of Athens, first on the path of Xerxes' army, bases its strength on its fleet, led by admiral Themistocles. Themistocles is forced to an unwilling alliance with the traditional rival of Athens, oligarchic Sparta whose might lies with its superior infantry troops. But Xerxes still reigns supreme in numbers over sea and land.

The cast led by Sullivan Stapleton (as Themistocles) is pretty good. The directing by Noam Murro is pretty good. The screenplay (based on the graphic novel Xerxes by Frank Miller, who also executive produced on the film) by Zack Snyder (who also produced the film) & Kurt Johnstad is pretty good.

The music by Junkie XL is pretty good. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is pretty good. The film editing by David Brenner & Wyatt Smith is pretty good. The casting by Lucy Bevan is pretty good. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is pretty good. The art direction by Sue Chan, Joe Farrell, Alexei Karagyaur, Darren Poe & Sonya Savova is pretty good. The set decoration by Jenny Oman & Simon Wakefield, set dressings by Don 'Tex' Clark, Nikolai Dikov & Kristian Stoyanov, set designs by Timothy M. Earls, Tammy S. Lee, Stefan Manchev, Yossif Mladenov, Nikolai Nikolov, Anshuman Prasad & Randall D. Wilkins is pretty good. The costume design by Alexandra Byrne is pretty good. The special effects make-up coordinated by Angela Angelova & designed by Aileen Seaton is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Allen Hall, supervised by Jovko Dogandjiski & designed by Mark Koivu are pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Victoria Albanese, Zaira Brilhante, Helene Becourt, Paola Chavez, Crystal Compton, Melissa Franco, Murray Gale, Sheila Giroux, James Grummitt, Ashlyn Hardie, Chris Jestico, Uday Joshi, Sian Judge, Dave Kim, Eric Kimelton, Lara Lom, Cara Payne, James Purdy, Samantha Rocca, Rebecca Scott, Paul Stemmer, Kraig Tytus & Nashia Wachsman & supervised by Charley Henley, Bryan Hirota, Richard E. Hollander, Betsy Paterson, Danielle Plantec & Stephan Trojansky are pretty good. The stunts & fights coordinated by Damon Caro are pretty good.

This is a pretty good sequel to ""300"", it isn't better than ""300"", but it is still pretty good, nonetheless. Sullivan Stapleton makes for a pretty good leading man as Themistocles & Eva Green does a pretty good job as well, vamping up the screen as Artemisia, Xerxes' commander of his Persian army. Noam Murro does a pretty good job, as well, in his second film after ""Smart People"" (2008). This is (or was) one of the most anticipated films of the last spring season, a decently, pretty good movie, altogether.",1415491200,,2830,5.068669527896995

5602519,3,B00BEJL6JK,"This movie mostly runs on over-the-top special effects and contrived dialog and plot elements. The story is about Demistocles, a general from Athens who rises to political power. After Sparta's 300 fell, he must defeat the navy of the Persians with his army. Very basic plot, most of it takes place on the Aegean sea.
90% of the scenes feel like a generic war speech, where the music crescendos, then the army cheers, and glorious battle commences. Most of the time the scenes are way too dramatic or intense and just come off as cheesy, there's no ""moderate"" here, everything goes towards extremes. Arrows hit their mark from thousands of feet away, single soldiers take down whole boats of people, each attack causes some extremely over the top damage in dramatic slow motion.

The thing is -- this movie almost lends itself to that so it ends up not seeming bad in the end. For what it is, it is well-executed, but all in all, it is just another Greek war movie much like 300. If you're just in it for the ride, it's a pretty good watch",1414800000,,1039,4.526595744680851

5602683,3,B00BEJL6JK,"300: Rise of an Empire is a more broad picture of what really occurred during the whole Persian-Greek War  from the years 490 - 480 B.C. The movie has more characters, a deeper plot and the same blood-slow-mo-stylish battles that caught so much attention (for good or bad) in the first 300. Overall, I feel this movie exploited a bit better the interesting story behind this conflict, although there are various things that did not happen: Themistocles never killed Darius in Marathon, etc. However, the whole naval landscape is one thing I loved about this movie, not only because the ships and tactics were all very close to historical records, but because of the whole beauty in every scene. I loved the battles, the dark sense of humour and the inclusion of more key characters and their stories.

However, there were two things that really bothered me: the detailed beheading of a defenseless prisoner and the length of the movie. Now, one thing is to see a battle with blood (nothing personal) and a very different thing is to focus on the suffering of a defenseless man while his head is being cut-off. The latter is completely sick and does not add anything to the development of the story nor the characters; it was an unnecessary scene from beginning to end. Instead of showing this, they could have added scenes that enriched the characters or the storyline (interesting dialogues, beautiful shots of Greece, etc.) because this movie runs short compared to almost every other movie being released (1hr 40min). This was the second thing that bothered me; they could have made the story and the characters richer (they had time!) but instead they decide to put useless gory scenes. The battles go in hand with gore, but leave the rest of the movie to explore the characters, broad the storyline and tighten the plot... it could have been a five-star movie for me.",1413244800,,1872,4.792569659442725

5602706,2,B00BEJL6JK,"I'm not sure that the makers of this film understood why the first one was popular.  The first 300 movie worked because it was completely ridiculous and over the top, but didn't take itself too seriously.  It was kind of like pro-wrestling.  The Spartans kept the movie light and entertaining with their bravado and practically suicidal nonchalance in the face of certain death.  I can think of at least 5 awesome one-liners from 300 off the top of my head.

This movie is a hollow imitation of its predecessor.  There is just nothing memorable about this movie except for a somewhat bizarre sex scene.  I literally just finished this movie and that's the only scene from it I can really remember.  Rise of an Empire introduces a new hero and villain, and focuses on the Athenians, who are supposed to be much less competent in battle.  This doesn't really show in their fighting aptitude, but their attitude is markedly different from that of the Spartans we all love so well, and the movie is much bleaker as a result.  Instead of delivering snappy one-liners and proclaiming his love for battle, the new main character spends most all of his time rattling on about freedom (he's a politician, by the way).

If you just NEED to watch shirtless guys stabbing each other in slow-motion, this movie will give you your fix, but otherwise, skip it.",1412985600,4,1345,4.705128205128205

This film doesn't even get near the visual and visceral wonder of the first film. It has the feel of a b-movie-esque follow up to a great successful first film. Even though it does feature the stunning Eva Green, the charisma of Gerard Butler is sorely missed. Ultimately, it is a significant let-down, particularly after we saw the setup for a sequel in the last minutes of the first film.

5602736,2,B00BEJL6JK,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" is less of a sequel to the 2007 original and more of a companion-piece, since much of what it chronicles overlaps, rather than follows, the events of that earlier film. The jumbled chronology leads to a great deal of confusion on the part of the viewer, helped not one whit by the fact that all the actors look pretty much the same in their Greek warrior attire, so that one is never quite sure who is fighting where or against whom. And, in all honesty, I'm not really sure it's worth the effort trying to figure it all out.

As far as I can tell, the set-up goes something like this: the effete and cowardly Athenians, who are always going on and on about things like philosophy and democracy, turn to the bellicose Spartans for help in defeating the Persians led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), son of the late King Darius (Yigal Naor). Yet, although Xerxes has been transformed into a gold-plated demi-god, he's really just the puppet of the far more ruthless and conniving Artemisia (Eva Green), who French kisses decapitated heads and has dreams of bringing arrogant Greece to its knees once and for all for killing her family and turning her into a sex-slave, though she herself is of Greek extraction. The Athenian leader is (the almost unpronounceable) Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), who killed King Darius with a very well-aimed arrow through the heart and was rewarded with command of the army in grateful recognition of that feat. Beyond this synopsis, you're on your own.

In an attempt to visually replicate the as-yet unpublished Frank Miller graphic novel that is its source, the movie employs a mix of live action and computer-generated imagery that puts the film in a kind of never-never-land of legendary pseudo-history.

This garish spectacle of stiff acting, gleaming pecs, passionate hate-sex, pop psychology, two-bit philosophizing and slow-motion bloodletting is indeed something to behold, but, frankly, you've seen it all before - only better - in the original film.",1412726400,,2018,4.946902654867257

Artemisia Biography:

Artemisia would have been ruler of Halicarnassus at the time of Herodotus' birth in that city. Her story comes to us from Herodotus.

Artemisia was the ruler of Halicarnassus (near today's Bodrum, Turkey) and its neighboring islands, part of the Persian empire then ruled by Xerxes. She assumed the throne after the death of her husband.

When Xerxes went to war against Greece (480-479 B.C.E.), Artemisia brought five ships and helped Xerxes fight the Greeks in the naval battle of Salamis.

The Greeks offered a reward of 10,000 drachmas for capturing Artemisia, but no one succeeded in winning the prize.

Xerxes eventually abandoned his invasion of Greece - and Artemisia is credited with persuading him to this decision.

After the war, according to Herodotus, Artemisia fell in love with a younger man, who did not return her love. And so she jumped from a cliff and killed herself.

 Why couldn't the writers have simply told this story. It's a lot more interesting than ""Cruella Deville"" meets Themisticles.  We are to believe that this women, with white white white skin like buttercream has spent her life on slave ships and then as Xerxes admiral. Whaaat? Do you know what years of salt wind and sun do to a woman's skin? Also, she was supposed to have been a slave prostitute on a slave ship. Did she abort all her pregnancies? Why are women's roles always written so stupidly.

Pro's: Somewhat historically based naval warfare between Athens' and Xerxes' boats.  Except the horse jumping from boat to boat.  And the ""love"" scene between opposing admirals.

5602789,3,B00BEJL6JK,"I went into this movie thinking it would start off where 300 ended. Neither the previews or the movie itself helped to clear up my confusion. It wasn't until about a quarter of the way through that I realized 1. the main character was not a Spartan and 2. this was taking place at the same time as the 300 battle. This confusion didn't help the story line, which was fairly weak to begin with.

The story begins with Themistokles, an Athenian warrior who commands a small fleet of ships to battle Xerses' naval forces. He is rumored to have killed Xerses' father with a bow and arrow, which kickstarted the war and all events thereafter. with vendetta in mind, Xerses and his adopted sister wage war against the Athenian forces, who are smarter but not as well trained as the Spartans. This means they have to use their wits against the Persians rather than their superior muscles.

The movie itself was quite entertaining once the confusion about when it took place was cleared up. My biggest issue was the constant use of slow motion action and unnecessary bloodshed resulting from the battles. At times it almost seemed like a joke, blood being spattered every which way in slow motion as an appendage was separated from a body. The severed head on the boat sticks out most in my mind, but there were several other scenes where this happened. It reminded me of a kid who learned a cool new magic trick and does it again and again trying to impress everyone. It was somewhat neat the first time around, but the novelty quickly wore off as they used it repeatedly during random parts of the movie. There are certain times where nifty camera shots could add to the emotion and effects of the scene, but throwing it into almost every battle seems like overuse or rubbing it in the faces of the audience that you can afford such extravagant special effects.",1412035200,,1855,4.5843373493975905

My only real problem with this movie is I have problems believing a woman who is probably 110 pounds soaking wet is a great warrior.  And parts of her story seem to not be completely relevant to the battle, so I'm quite confused by how they have interwoven her into the overarching theme.

Perversely, I'm glad I did since I can also comment on the ridiculous cartoons shown during the ending credits. Calling the movie bad defames the meaning of the word, ""bad"". The only thing shocking about this movie is the fact that someone actually made it. I will admit that a lot of talent was used to create this movie. I can only say, ""What a waste of skill and talent."" It's sad that the people who made this movie took an historical event that could have made a monumental movie, even including mythological creatures and characters with ""some' fantasy thrown in, using the special effects available today,and managed to totally trash it.

The movie missed the opportunity to tell the real story of Artemesia the Greek woman who ruled Halicarnassus and was a commander in Persian king Xerxes navy. Instead the movie was intent on denigrating women and Persians. The only truthful bit of the story was the portrayal of the Spartans as nasty lunatics. All this supposedly celebrates Athenian democracy. Is there such a thing as fascist democracy? Here is a good example.

It is not a good action movie. The fight scenes are terrible, they just go through and slash at each other with giant splatters of blood filling the screen, there's no skill or real combat shown.

It is not a good war movie. The first 300 showed offense/defense, strategy, etc. This has none of that.

It does not have a good plot. The story jumps all over the place and the time line makes very little sense.

It does not have good acting. I don't know if this is because of all the other problems with the film, or because of the specific actors, but it's almost painful to watch the terrible acting.",1410480000,4,750,4.1875

This time, we get to experience gladiator battles on the high seas which is a great idea.  Unfortunately, the director sinks his own battleship.

Here's how the movie goes:  Men roaring.  Now, battle scene.  Men tired=motivational speech.  Proceed to next battle scene.  Battle is over;  time for the good guy leader to have random rough sex with the evil enemy leader.  Good guy leader safely returns to his downtrodden men.  Uh oh, it looks like somebody needs to give another motivational speech (just don't tell the tired men that you had sex with the person trying to kill everyone).  Yay!!! The speech works, and the men fight again.  Buttoning up the ending, good guys win this battle, but the war's not over.

Ya, this movie's terrible.  The sad reality is that this movie is way more monotonous than my description.

5603343,3,B00BEJL6JK,"300: The Rise of an Empire
 300: Rise of an Empire is not an historical epic in the mode of Troy of 2004.  It is not even a visually dazzling, technically innovative masterpiece of blood and history like its predecessor 300, the tale of the world famous defense of Thermopylae by the Spartans. Zack Snyder, one of the two writers, also wrote Sucker Punch.  If we can compare 300: Rise of an Empire to any other movie, we might call it the offspring of Sucker Punch by 300.  Then movie goers would know what they are in for.  This is not a film of historical accuracy.  It is a film based on a fantasy from a funny book with a totally fictional story set in an actual historical frame.  300 came close to what is actually known about the famous last stand of the Spartans.  300: Rise of an Empire is as close to historical truth as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is to Lincoln.
 Many will find this a pleasing afternoons splatter-tainment, but history it is not.
 Kurt Johnstad, co-writer with Snyder, also joined with Snyder on the script of the then innovative and visually arresting 300.  Johnstad also wrote Act of Valor a well received war flick featuring actual Navy SEALs playing Navy SEALs.  The dialog in this one seems stilted and often silly with bombastic speeches.  The actors themselves seem at times put off by the words on their lips.
 The film covers the time before, during and some years after the Battle of Thermopylae.  The Battle of Marathon, the only battle in history to have been turned into an Olympic sporting event, is shown in a way that is a true to the actual battle as WWF wrestling is true to actual wrestling.  The historical battle is dramatic enough that a straight depiction of it would satisfy both action movie fans and history buffs.
 The climax of the film is the Battle of Salamis, the battle that saved the Western World from being absorbed into Persias slave empire.  Again, the actual battle bears no resemblance to what we see on the silver screen.  Sigh.
 But lots of nameless bad guys are sliced up.  Some are chopped up.  A few are shot full of arrows or speared.  And when they meet their demise, arcs of blood follow the tip of the Greek swords, over and over again.  The nameless Greeks are able to jump 50 feet from a cliff to the deck of an enemy ship without breaking either an ankle or a sweat (and chop up a nameless bad guy on the way.)  It all becomes very tiresome after a short while.

 Director Noam Murro, whos only other major directing credit is the unremarkable 2008 Smart People, was somehow given control over this eye pleasing but empty film and 100 million dollars.  Or maybe the relatively little known director was given the responsibility for the film but not the control, as sometimes happens in Hollywood.
 But the film is artistically true to its comic book origin.  The fantastic ships, waves, armor, action and costumes reflect the mind of a comic book cartoonist.  And we rarely get to see a Greek hero ride a war horse across the deck of a trireme and jump to a Persian vessel.  There is a certain novelty value to that.
 Eva Green and the other players do what they can to imitate comic book heroes.  I do like Green as a movie star and found her love scene with Sullivan Stapleton (as the leader of Athens, Themistocles) to be disturbingly in character to Artemisia, the Greek admiral in Persian pay, that she played.  Watching her parade around in get ups more appropriate to a throne room on Mars pleases some movie fans.
 Lena Headey returned in her role as Queen Gorgo.  Gorgo was the Spartan Queen widowed when her husband died defending Thermopylae.  She is perhaps the most believable character, not because Green or Stapleton are lesser actors but simply because she is given less outlandish speech and actions.
 I can award a thin two saw blades to 300: Rise of an Empire largely because it doesnt even try to be as believable as Snow White.  It is very bloody, which audiences seem to like.  It carries a hard R rating for nudity, violence, rape and murder, all more or less offered in graphic exaggeration.  It lasts one hour and 43 minutes.  Frankly, I was relieved when it was over.",1409443200,,4177,4.528074866310161

5603373,4,B00BEJL6JK,"I enjoyed ""Rise of an Empire"",  but I can see how folks might not like it.  This is the story of the battle of Artemisium, the other battle that was going on about the same time as the battle of Thermopylae, fictionalized in ""300"".  The short version is that the Greeks were badly outnumbered,  but lured the Persian allies into narrows where the quality of Greek seamanship was about to balance the odds.

The movie focuses on Artemisia, a Greek queen allied with the Persians, and while an amazing character, not quite the epic character the movie makes her out to be.  Xerxes also figures large in Rise of an Empire, as the god-king of Persia.  The story behind Xerxes transformation is laid out here.  This is entirely fictional, as Xerxes ascension to the throne was more peaceful than many in that region and period.  And a lot of attention is paid to Themistocles, the Greek commander.

The tempo is slower than ""300"", and the action is more maritime, so a bit slower than ""300"".  The tone is more academic, also.  All this could be off putting for many viewer.

Good movie, as historically accurate as 300, which is to say somewhat accurate, but terrible on costumes with much artistic liberties taken.

in the history of Ancient Greece and its travails with the Persian Empire.  The overuse of blood splattering, and some fight scenes is distracting.  We never really know what's in the mind of the major protagonists, and are surprised in critical parts by what the two opposing commanders of the fleets do to defeat each other.

Those are actually pretty lame reasons not to like something when you think about it. Taken on its own merits, it is an exciting action movie, highlighted by some highly imaginative naval battles, the return of Lena Headley and David Wenham from the first movie and a great performance from Evan Green as the villain. The action is also in the same style as 300, which I liked. Of course, it is not historically accurate (the Spartans had no navy and queens did not lead their troops in battle), but I was surprised to find out that Eva Green's character did exist. I hope they do a third movie, which would logically follow the Greeks inally chasing the Persians off the peninsula following their victory at Platea.

5603516,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Pretty good movie, but it's a stretch calling it a sequel to 300.  I liked the movie, however the original 300 movie is better",1408579200,,126,4.25
5603537,3,B00BEJL6JK,"300 - Rise of an Empire is clearly a testosterone-laden, gore-soaked, fantasy version of what the days of the Greeks were like. It never pretends to be a historical documentary or an Ivory Merchant gentle story. That being said, just how well does 300 - Rise of an Empire do at its target quest?

I'm perhaps unusual because I'm not the target audience for this movie. I'm female. I'm over forty. That being said, I adore movies with sword combat. I've taken sword fighting training for several years and write books involving female sword fighters. I enjoyed the first 300 movie immensely, even with its graphic novel style and gushing blood. I love movies like Gladiator and Conan. I understand that this is a fantasy, not a portrayal of actual events. I understand that it's going to be over the top.

Also, I give them film immense kudos for portraying two capable females who can hold their own in this world. It wasn't that long ago that a man simply COULD NOT fight a woman in a movie because that would be cruel. Clearly women were too weak to defend themselves properly. I am so thrilled that modern movies show women who are strong and talented. Here we have Queen Gorgo of Sparta - played by the talented Lena Headey of Game of Thrones fame. She's furious about the death of her husband, the hero from the first 300, and wants revenge. Here you see her from behind as she charges into battle, leading her men.

We also have Artemisia, played by Eva Green, who is the naval commander for the entire Persian army. For Game of Thrones fans, you can think of her in two ways. First, she was trained from a young woman to be a swordswoman and had great talent in it. The training scenes are much like Arya Stark building her skill set. She's able to land a solid blow on her trainer.

So that is awesome! Women with strength. Women who are taken seriously. When Artemisia grows to adulthood she is similar to a second GoT character. Artemisia's men don't mutter behind her back about her being female. They respect her skill and talents. She's like Asha Greyjoy in Game of Thrones - a fierce naval commander who earns the respect of her troops.

So I like swordplay. I like strong male and female characters! I enjoy fantasy stories and don't mind the gore. This should have been a perfect movie for me. Why do I have issues with it?

First, as much as I adore the two female characters, it irks me that they still fall into the two main categories that women in these male-power movies tend to portray. There's the loyal, chaste wife who dutifully does what she should. The main character, General Themistocles, is respectful to Queen Gorgo her and treats her fairly as an equal.

Then there's the loose woman who uses her body to achieve her goals. The whore-slash-prostitute who uses her sexuality to get what she wants from men. Artemisia climbs all over Themistocles, he rips off her clothing, and when it seems she might want to stop he flips her over and takes her anyway. It's not exactly rape, but it's fairly close. Clearly she's egging him on - and somehow, despite all her years of experience with men, she's surprised when he does the ""honorable thing"" and refuses to switch sides after having his way with her. ""Ha ha,"" he seems to say, ""I got what I want and now I'm leaving.""

Studies have been done - and the mere fact that these have been done boggles my mind - about how men react to different types of sexual videos. They like it, naturally, if the woman wants the sex and participates in it. But according to these studies the men watching seem to react more strongly when the woman does NOT want the sex at first, but due to the man's prowess they get sucked into wanting it almost against their will. So a rape sequence where the woman ends up enjoying it. It's troubling of course that this is appealing for a portion of men - but it's even more troubling to me that this is portrayed on the big screen as a fantasy to watch and emulate. Certainly one could say that ""it's just a movie and clearly a fantasy"" - but movies have a way of infiltrating into our minds. We build ideals and patterns based on what we watch. A woman who watches gentle romances all the time might come to believe - even slightly - that she deserves some gentle romance in her life. She begins to crave it, just a little. What might happen to a man who watches near-rape scenes all the time, where the woman is saying no but it seems she actually means yes?

Certainly I'm not advocating that all movies be happy-go-lucky films that avoid mention of any challenging topic. Some of my favorite movies tackle hard core issues. At the same time, it makes me uncomfortable that a movie aimed directly at a young-adult male market, with powerful female characters, has to stoop to having the hero rape one of them in order to make a point. Was that really a necessary part of the plot? Surely the same message could have been made more powerfully without rape? This woman has already been raped throughout her life. Was this one more rape - by the HERO - a critical part of how the story unfolded? Or was it the writers being lazy? Or playing out their own fantasy, which should give us pause ...

I'll note as a final point about this that the actual Artemisia was brilliant, wise - and she was a loyal wife and mother, just like Queen Gorgo. She was the daughter of a king and took the throne when her husband died. She took over the naval commander job, too, at that point. So in many ways she is just like Queen Gorgo. Why not showcase Artemisia in this manner? Why turn her into a whore? It seems to be because the writers wanted a wild rape-sex scene and it just isn't ""right"" to do that with the dedicated-wife character. However it's quite fine to do that to a loose woman. Maybe with a loose woman ""she deserves it."" Which, again, bothers me.

Maybe this is what the directors were going for, but it made it seem much more fantastic and ridiculous than realistic.
Call me a prude, but I thought the sexuality was much more unnecessary in this movie than in the prior film. While 300 had plenty of sensuality of its own, it was much more subtle than this film. The acting wasn't bad, but I also didn't feel much of a connection to what  was happening. There was character development, but in ways that didn't make me care about them.
TL;DR, my boyfriend looked at me at the end of this movie and said that he'd pay another four dollars to take back ever watching it.",1407974400,13,1059,4.487046632124352

5603909,2,B00BEJL6JK,"To start out, let me just say that I really enjoyed '300'. I was trained in Ancient Greek, have read Herodotus, and thought the first movie was an excellent (though expectedly loose) adaptation of the over-the-top source material. This movie I was much less pleased with. Not because of inaccuracies, because I wasn't expecting accuracy. This film failed in its own right and as a sequel.
'300' took itself very seriously; so does this film, which leads to problems when many of the scenes are even more wildly nonsensical and obviously dependent on CGI than those in the first one. This wasn't so much a movie as a series of disjointed scenes. It had all of the trademarks of '300' but none of the finesse. For example, that slow-down-speed-up device that was used several times in the last movie was heavily exploited in this film, until it felt difficult to find ten seconds in combat not distorted that way. Likewise, the blood (which in the last movie was appropriately comic-book fake) was the strangest CGI mess. It was made up of shiny, clumpy, gravity-defying globules that exploded from everyone at the slightest provocation. There was so much more of it that it almost became a drinking game.
The plot was unnecessarily complex, probably weighed down by the fact that whenever a villain is introduced, the following three minutes are devoted to delving into his or her backstory, a habit normally reserved for villains with interesting backgrounds that make sense. It was nice to see Artemisia of Caria, but she was severely dumbed down to 'hot, manipulative, evil girl who can kill people and tries to seduce the protagonist', instead of the brave, loyal advisor/commander we get in Herodotus. In the film, I struggle to understand why she's so valued. And Xerxes himself was foreign and 'barbaric' as ever.
The film tried to interweave itself with the timeline of '300', but sadly the pacing dragged horribly. It really felt like I'd already watched two short, unsatisfying movies before the Battle of Salamis even began. I understand the wider focus that the story was trying to cover, but the whole time I was wishing for the simple, solid, '300' structure of 'Greeks go somewhere and fight the Persians epically'.",1407283200,2,2229,4.915119363395226

As a sequel it paled in comparison. Granted it had a LOT to live up to, but I experienced it as trying to copy the original in all the wrong ways and falling short in too many.

Butler's absence was handled miserably and violence was gratuitous, cartoonish and just excessive to no good end other than special effects. 300 was also violent - and I don't care for violent movies - but it never felt like violence for violence's sake.

Perhaps the source material was inferior, but as others have pointed out Eva's character was the most sympathetic in the whole film - it was her story, not anyone else's.

Given I'd never seen Wood before I enjoyed that, but otherwise save your money until this hits cable or alternately save your life force and watch something else.",1407110400,,838,4.493421052631579

It had more action, more fights, more of most everything (including a storyline) than the first movie, and received worse reviews. It had more violence, better video, more sex-appeal, and lots more sets and special-effects. It's like a whole group of people ran to see this movie that would rather watch the movie Chocolat or Driving Miss Daisy; and were abysmally appalled at what they experienced. Of all those who came to see the movie, and complained, you really should ask them to stop complaining, and ask them what they didn't like about the movie, and then ask them to name a 5-star movie as they would rate one. Chances are, the movie they choose as a 5-star doesn't begin to compare to this one. Try it, and I think you'll find a bunch of 'out of their genre' or 'paid to complain' critics trying to wrongly lead you away from this movie. If you like action, adventure, 300 (the original) style battle, all built around the 300 myth and story, then you will LOVE this movie.

Yes, the Greek navy smashed the Persian force at Salamis.  Yes, there was a woman commander named Artemesia(though she was not in overall command and is best known for cutting through one of the other Persian ships, sending it to the bottom, as she fled).  And the Persians did burn Athens.  Aside from that, the movie was utter nonsense.
Then again, it is based on the gendre of ""graphic novels"", which are essentially comic books for adults who never learned to read in schools(working too hard on their self-esteem and too little on their studies?).  For this reason, I had low expectations.

They needed the ominous narrator from the first film to tie together their scenes of slow motion, computer generated blood spray, and tiresome speeches.  There is nothing here, except some nifty shots to look at and inspiration to go to the gym.

No right now take this movie and understand that in real life when Leonidas went to the Hell's Gate with his men and allies, the Persians could've outflanked them if they could've gotten their Calvry behind them.

I was not one who was a fan of the way the original 300 was filmed with it slo-motion action scenes and stop sequences, spewing blood and computer generated graphics that almost border on cartoonish. This sequel has more of that and although I am still not a fan of that way of filming, it either has been toned down a bit or I have gotten use to it from the last movie.  The special effects of the scenery seem to be better with its multiple ships and the roaring sea.  For me, the story is the weakest part of the movie as it is nearly a repeat of the original in terms of story and plot.  However, this movie is not trying to be more than it is.  This movie is one that is non stop action that you really don't have to think much about, you just sit back and take the ride and enjoy and 300 makes no apologies for that.

For action fans with nothing to stand in you way but action throughout, then this is the movie for you.  For those looking for a more substantial plot and historic accuracy, then you most likely not like this movie.

I thought this movie could have been better.  It actually wasn't about the Spartans so much as it featured the army of Athens, who were nowhere near the same class of warriors as the Spartans.  When the Athenian general went to enlist the assistance of Sparta, they refused.  So Athens takes on the overwhelming enemy alone. Just as they are on the verge of getting wiped out, here come the Spartans!  This is where the viewer says, ""Oh, yeah!  It's clobberin' time!  We've been waiting for the cavalry to arrive!""  And...this is where the movie ends.  Rip - Off!

5604727,3,B00BEJL6JK,"Personally, I went in with the lowest of expectations with ""300: Rise of an Empire."" The first ""300"" was very good for its time, an entertaining festival of unadulterated machismo and bloody carnage. Perhaps it hasn't aged very well in the seven years since its release, with its more problematic elements becoming more highlighted by the influx of action films with better female characterization, but I would still contend that it's a very entertaining, fun film. But three years shy of a decade later (god, I feel old,) why is a follow-up even remotely necessary?

For much of its 100+ minute runtime, ""Rise of an Empire"" desperately tries to prove its worth to skeptics like myself, and mostly succeeds. It isn't a sequel, in the strictest sense of the word, nor is it a prequel. Instead, we have a story that takes place before, during, and a bit after the events of the first film, It follows Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton,) a blue-caped Athenian crusader responsible for killing King Darius, which in turn spurs his son Xerxes into becoming the borderline iconic villain fans remember. But while Leonidas focused on direct ground confrontation, most of the action here takes place on the high seas, pitting our protagonist against the menacing navel commander Artemisia (expertly played by Eva Green.)

And when the focus is on that action, this sequel soars. The action sequences are some of the most well-choreographed I've seen all year, especially the explosive, physics-defying climax. When films have a focus on navel warfare, they often tend to drag on and becoming grandiose, budget-driven bores. But here, the script eschews typical ship battles, instead focusing on implausible yet exhilarating bits of action. Horses jump from boat to boat, ships spew oil which is of course lit ablaze, soldiers leap from masts and plunge their blades into the skulls of the opposition. If you're looking for fun swordplay and bloody chaos, few movies do it better than this.

Which makes other parts of the film feel like a thundering bore. Yes, when ""Rise of an Empire"" decides to focus on political intrigue or grand proclamations of battle, it falls woefully short of the heights delivered by its predecessor. There are no ""tonight we dine in hell"" or ""this is Sparta"" moments here, only cut-rate dialogue which exists only to drive the plots. That is, when we're focused on the Athenian side of things. The characters of Artemisia and Gorgo (Lena Headey reprises her role) get the best lines, ironic in a movie so blatantly pitched towards men. But when they're off camera, which is too often, the film necessitates that Stapleton steps into the spotlight, and not to be too harsh, but the guy just can't carry a whole movie.

Speaking of Gorgo and Artemisia, I have to commend Zac Snyder and Kurt Johnstead for improving the female characterization present in this series. While it's still no ""Divergent"" or ""Hunger Games,"" both of these characters get to slay the opposition and remain mostly undefined by victimhood. I also have to hand it to the movie for handling the topic of sexual assault in a non-glorified, non-sexualized manner. It's portrayed not as some forbidden vice, but as a disgusting act of subjugation and domination, which is exactly how it was implemented in the time period during which this is supposed to take place. Gone are the days of the naked, dancing oracle and Gorgo's assault in the previous film, and it shows that the franchise is willing to not entirely alienate a female audience. Good stuff. Not great, but good.

What more is there to say about ""300: Rise of an Empire"" aside from that last sentiment, then? It's nothing groundbreaking, nor does it feel as innovative or original as the first film, but it constantly undermines the viewer's doubt in it being a worthy addition to the series canon. It may get dull at times, but the action sequences and great performances from Green and Headey, paired with Junkie XL's excellent score, manage to save the film from complete mediocrity. This won't win over people who don't like this sort of film, but for fans of the original or people looking for a high-flying action experience, it's a solid bit of entertainment that'll probably be worth your time.

Well, ""fast forwarding"" to the now I am grateful for fast forward because this movie was really, really bad.  For the $ put in to production, the technology available, the ease of repeating a successful first movie...I'm amazed at how bad this was.  Lazy?  Drugs?  Lots of drugs?  Don't know exactly how the filmmakers pulled it off, but they managed to take a good example (the first movie was a bit over-stylized and full of stereotypes and platitudes, but hey, it was unabashedly so) and make a scattershot plot with computer game effects and no characters/actors who were particularly compelling.

I'd seen bad reviews.  I expected it to be bad.  Was in the mood for a basic ""guy"" flick.  I can handle cheese and stupidity and usually like it.  This was just bad.

At least 300 sort of ""loosely"" stuck to the script of the actual life events.  This movie really makes no sense.  The Athenians were the sea power, not the Spartans.  Themistocles is the naval commander in charge of the Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis.  However, in this fictional account it was Themistocles against a ""Goth"" Artemisia.  The movie goes down hill and never recovers.  We see ""human suicide torpedoes"", ""battleship"" rowing ships (if not computer generated the structural wood would break in real life), a ""300"" Xerxes going in and out randomly at point in the movie, and the movie just makes you want to shut the Blue Ray player down and read a book.

The new chapter starts with an episode about how Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), antagonist of 300, became what he was, and then (largely) covers events up to the Battle of Salamis, a sea battle that took place after the combats described in the original. Well, in short, you are not going to see Gerard Butler, who is sorely missed here.

Sullivan Stapleton (Animal Kingdom) plays Themistocles, an Athenian general fighting against the Persian navy led by cold-hearted and manipulative Artemisia (Eva Green). Though some characters of the original return, the new film is basically about these two hardly fleshed out characters that we really don't know much about. The CGI-combat scenes, mostly naval ones, are decent, but far less intense than those in the original, repeating slow motion again and again. No over-the-top, bloody war.

5604938,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Yes, I give this movie four stars. This is not based on just the acting or just the cinematography. It's a four star for everything overall. I am a fan of Sullivan Stapleton because of his work on Strike Back, so I was really glad to see him in something so big budget. Eva Green and Lena Headey are always beautiful and great actresses and I was glad to see Rodrigo Santoro reprise Xerxes, the God King. After the first movie, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. But only because I wanted to know more about what happened after the 300 were killed. So, we get this movie and I'm thinking. YES SEQUEL, FINALLY. We now get to see the aftermath. But this wasn't a sequel.

It was a companion piece and then the last few minutes of the movie, we get to see a bit of a sequel. So, we're seeing what was happening WHILE the first movie was going on and then a little bit afterwards. So, it's not a sequel, but a companion-quel.

I was happy to see the backstory and was really interested as to why Xerxes had attacked them in the first place. GREAT. But my problem was this...we didn't get to see enough. The backstory pulled me in so much, that I'm thinking well crap...I wanna know more! And then I'm thinking, well this is a Xerxes movie and maybe we get to see a little bit of him and Artemisia. Not so. As a matter of fact, Xerxes is not even in it that much. He was such a big fixture in the first one that I felt like he was a nuisance and forgotten in this one, which was a big mistake on the writer's parts.

I read a little bit of the graphic novel that the first movie was based on and I'm not sure if this movie is based on another GN, but they shouldn't have made this movie a companion piece, even if the GN was that. They should have made this a sequel or maybe even a freaking prequel. There were so many missed opportunities for this movie to blow us away, but it didn't work out.

Still, I give it four stars, because the directing and cinematography were beautiful. The costumes were beautiful. Eva, Lena, Rodrigo were great. Sully was okay, but he had to work with what he had and I commend him on that. The script was okay, for a companion piece, but could have been better and would have been better if it was a sequel or prequel.

5605056,3,B00BEJL6JK,"I found this film had many good aspects which I will discuss in this review.

The special effects, art direction, control of color were excellent. The film is a visual experience with scenes slowed down during acts of violence while crimson black blood flows. The palate for the film was restricted to dark Prussian blue, dark crimson black, black and burnt umber. This had the effect of making skin tones appear as glowing against the color drained sets. I don't think there was a sky blue or yellow or pastel in the entire film. This control of the color range results in a dark deterministic view of history and conveys a sense of mythology to the entire drama.

The screenplay has all characters saying over-the-top over-statements with virtually no naturalistic dialogue. All the dialogue is meant to propel the story forward rather than to convince the viewer that these might be real people on the screen. Yet I found the acting to be highly engaging since it was so exaggerated. Sullivan Stapleton was excellent as Themistocles and was able to convey that he was a human called upon to engage in outstanding deeds for the future of his people. But it is Eva Green who totally steals the film as the Persian Naval commander Artemisia.  I don't think I have seen such a perfectly controlled acting by a woman whose every emotion is artificial and protected behind a facade of over-acting since Gloria Swanson starred in Sunset Boulevard.  Eva Greens acting lets us know that this is not a real woman in front of us, but a caricature of an archetype; the viewer must watch her every step and dread her throughout the film.

Lena Headey, a star of Game of Thrones, is regal as Spartan Queen Gorgo. Handsome Hans Matheson, a star in Sherlock Holmes and The Tudors, plays Aeskylos, the character to whom Themistocles most often reflects so that his inner thoughts are apparent to the viewers. Callan Mulvey, an actor in Zero Dark Thirty, plays Scyllias, Themistocles other close friend who provides a subplot with his son Calisto, played by Jack OConnell.  Rodrigo Santoro returns to play Xerxes who has in some way become a god, yet there are no godlike characteristics in the film.

The storyline is extremely clear and sequenced so that the viewer is never lost as battle follows battle, each with unique build-up and consequences. Each battle scene offered new visual experiences and special effects. Likewise the reasons for the Greek and Persian sea battles are explained well, even if there is no historical accuracy to this plot.

This film has more perfectly proportioned male actors with little clothes than almost any film I can remember. This use of perfectly built muscular men had the result of conveying to the viewer that this is not a natural story based in reality but rather a myth based in history and storytelling. The result of using such well proportioned muscular actors is that the battle scenes have much in common with ballet or modern dance, both testosterone driven and beautiful.

Dont expect historical accuracy or subtle natural character development, it just never happens in this stylized version of myth.",1405728000,,3141,4.867041198501872
5605057,3,B00BEJL6JK,"It was ok, but not nearly as good as original 300.  Was hard to become attached to any of characters like in first movie. Even original 300 managed a little subtle humor too.

Although it is a blood bath, it still holds much of the ancient history's stories of military action and events. This the dramatic twist of hollywood brought in, this is a great hack n slash movie with a good continued story line. I always like close combat better than guns and artillery anyways.
Some tweaks I would've put in the movie would've been making it longer to put in more detail and background, plus having it slowed down for much of the dramatic scenes. Never the less, it is still a good movie.
This gets my five stars because it was a thrill ride to remember while, though not as accurate as I wished, retelling the story of the war between Greece and Persia. There is plenty of blood and theater for all to go around, and I would deem this an excellent, though not perfect sequel to 300.",1405641600,,852,4.39873417721519

5605148,5,B00BEJL6JK,"The long awaited follow up to 2007's hit 300 is exciting, very entertaining. There is a new director (the little known Noam Murro from Israel), but the recharged, operatic style, with heavy use of digital imagery, that made the first movie famous is back again. It can be said that this is not technically a sequel, as both movies happen more or less simultaneous chronologically: the first movie took place in the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC). The new one, after an introduction in the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), centers on the Battle of Salamis, in 480 BC, around the same time as Thermopylae. (Of course, I know you don't go to movies like this to learn about history).

Sorting out from their defeat at Marathon, the new Persian emperor Xerxes decides to take revenge in the form of a large seaborne invasion of Greece. His main admiral is the incredibly sexy but brutal Artemisia, who is Greek born but was saved when she was a little girl by a Persian and has lived in the Persian court ever since, thirsting for revenge against her native land. The Greek side, on the other hand is commanded by the brave, honest Athenian Themistocles.

As Themistocles, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton is fine, though he lacks somewhat the charisma Gerard Butler showed playing Leonidas in the first film. But Eva Green as Artemisia is magnificent, magnetic, by far the most charismatic character of the film. Rodrigo Santoro is back as (a very fantastic) Xerxes. Lena Heady reappears briefly as Gorgo, Queen of Sparta. There are very fine action scenes involving naval battles, but the movie's best scene has Artemisia bringing Themistocles to her boat to ostensibly discuss peace, but it all ends up in a heated sexual rump.",1405555200,2,1725,4.824324324324325

They use the slow motion in all the wrong places, the blood and gore effects are laughably bad, and they shove the 3D in your face; which would have been okay if I was watching the 3D version, but I, in fact, was not.  I also have to agree with some people on the sex scene; it was horrendous.  All I can say is that if you were really looking forward to this movie, just don't.  Turn and run the other way.  The first few minutes of the credits were better than the entire film.  Please don't waste your precious time or money on this crap.

5605151,1,B00BEJL6JK,Worst movie ever!,1405555200,,17,5.0
5605152,5,B00BEJL6JK,"I guess It's been a while since I watched the original ""300"" [I got one heck of a laugh out of the spoof, ""Meet the Spartans"" though, and had to watch that more than once!].  It seemed to me as if this film was so violent and gory that [obviously I'm exaggerating] I thought it made ""300"" look like ""Sound of Music"" by comparison.  But on to a real review:
This film is a curious amalgam of true history, myths and legends about the actual history, Hollywood-style distortion of the history, and sheer, gory bloody action, of the type young males seem to like more than other audiences.  In the latter the same styles and techniques as in ""300"" are used: the Greeks are dressed in the same, half-nude battle gear; you see just brief glimpses of the famed Persian ""immortals"", dispersed among regular troops; there's a mixture of normal action, slow-motion action, and stop-frame images of key [dramatic and gory] movements in the battles.  The gore far surpasses the sex, in terms of explicitness.  There's no full-frontal nudity, although there is some partial nudity and depiction of one sexual act, basically from the upper-body only.  There's very little vulgarity [I guess watching dismemberments is somehow less offensive than hearing a swearword, which is ubiquitous in real combat throughout history].

This story complements ""300"", in that it shows events [in the Greek city-states and in Persia] both prior to and subsequent to the story of ""300"".  It shows a larger context of the story of the Greeks vs. the Persians, and that the naval battles were just as important as the battles on land.  You really see nothing of the battle at Thermopylae; only one scene of the end result: 300 dead Spartans.

Visually I thought this movie was spectacular and beautiful.  Not that I'm calling the fighting beautiful, but depictions of the ships, the sea, the sky, fires, palaces, etc. all look better than real.

For those really interested in the history, the Blu-Ray contains several bonuses such as ""Real Leaders and Legends"", an excellent discussion of what we know about the true history [some of it filmed right at the sites of battle], and its historical importance.  The naval battle at Salamis is called ""the most important naval battle in history"" [with good reason], and clearly Themistocles was both a charismatic figure and a master tactician for the Greeks.  I found it all fascinating, both visually and historically.",1405555200,,2434,4.904878048780488
5605173,2,B00BEJL6JK,"My expectations were low going-in, and the movie still disappointed me.  Flat characters and well--poor writing.  The story tries to emphasize the theme of freedom, and Themistocles continues to say he's ""fighting for Greece,"" but the audience never gets a good idea of what Greece is to begin with.  It's not like the original 300, wherein you have a solid concept of Sparta and what it means to be a Spartan.  Also, in comparison to Sparta, the Greeks seem completely watered-down.  Also, I didn't believe for a second that that Artemisia (Eve Green) was a great commander and warrior because the decisions she makes as a commander are well, inexplicably stupid--and from a casting point, she just doesn't appear as though she could stand-up in any fight--probably because she has no muscle--which definitely stands-out in a film full of chiseled, muscle-bound warriors.  The film turns into a softcore-porn at one point, which might have even been okay, except that the actors playing Themistocles and Artemisia have ""0"" chemistry together.

If you're thinking to yourself right now, ""this movie was probably made as a cash-grab,"" then please--trust that instinct (because it is!), and preserve the good memory you have of the original by NOT watching this.",1405555200,,1260,5.117073170731707

It directly contradicts the first in several ways (the ending of the first did not align with this one, the characters did not have the same motivations, etc.) the fights were all about blood and nothing else (how are farmers supposed to fight that well when they were cut down like butter in the first) there was no character development and the whole Naval warfare plot was BS (boats don't turn that easily in the water). Did the writer really think ""They liked a movie about trained soldiers fighting on land, they must like non-trained soldiers who are surprisingly good with swords fighting on boats"". Now on to some random questions I had: Why was it important to make the ""God-King"" actually become a god in the beginning when it never came into play later in the movie and you were led to believe he wasn't actually a god in the first movie. How was the queen so good with a sword in the end? Was this movie supposed to underplay the first; did the 300 have it easier because these fools were out on their boats? Where did they train to become as good as the 300? Why did the queen not want to fight after her husband died? I thought their whole life was spent training for battle and death was welcome, is this a lie? Why did the last scene with a horse look like a video game? Is this going to become a video game? How did they get such high explosives? How did anybody survive being so close to the high explosives? How can they see so far when somebody is shooting an arrow? Why did I waste my time watching the movie or writing a review?

The special effects were great, as expected; the scenes were of a high caliber, wonderful sound quality, etc. The bad-butt of the chief enemy in this film was actually better than the original movie.

Now to the bad. There was a series lack of action in this movie and it came off as trying to hard on the main character. He just wasn't Leonidas-and you kept being reminded of it by the acting quality. While the plot is somewhat obvious, if you hadn't seen the original you'd be lost. Correction: you'd be even more lost, as they didn't make this prequel like film seamless-and it shouldn't been. Overall, it was rather forgettable and that's embarrassing considering the direction the movie could've went in since it was obvious the powers that be were thinking ""franchise.""",1405123200,,1049,4.860335195530726

i don't understand the title. its the defeat of an empire. there's a movie about some guy named alexander that could have really talked about the actual rise. even so it was a century later.

and (this is a criticism for both films) the poor showing of zoroastrianism bugs me: they would not have had god-kings since they believed in one god. and it's not like anyone thought xerxes was the 'one who brings great benefit' or anything special, just a guy, punishing the greeks for their insolence in supporting ionian revolts. oh and the whole ""freedom"" thing is more hilarious in this movie since there are slaves rowing the greek boats

5605810,5,B00BEJL6JK,"Like it's predecessor 300, blood splashed scenes mark this movie for the squemish or young, but that was war in the Ancient World.  Like 300 the scenes look as if done by Frank Miller in his illustrated novel.  Some inaccurate history is put in for a better story, but then it is entertainment not a History of the Second Persian War.  True there are historical characters but some of the history is not a paer of Herodotus' account, though doubtless his fascination with unusual stories that sneak into his accounts would have benn what he would have enjoyed.  Xerxes was not a god and certainly never wore such outfits,  Artemnisia's background was not really known but as the wife of the king of Halicanasis she proved a match for Thermosticles, but little is known of her before or after this time.  She merely was a trusted advisor to the King of Kings, Xerxes, and brought and commanded a fleet of her own.  That was a very unusual position for a woman in the 5th Century BCE, and a source of great curiosity for Heroditus,
Actually women get a good part of the story telling.  Queen Gorgo of Sparta tells the story played by Lena Heady (Game of Thrones' Cersei) and Eva Green as Artemnesia.  Both are stong women when women haedly are given a nodd in history.
Sullivan and all the men in the movie are lovely to watch, and you wondered if they called every gym boy to work on the movie, but they were trained for the phyicality of thr movie in a month of working out for the movie.

5605834,3,B00BEJL6JK,"The blood effects in this movie are almost cartoonish. Everyone in ancient Greece and Persia must have had incredibly high blood pressure. Cuts result in fountains of CG blood. Numerous decapitations, several rape scenes, and more boobies than the original make this one fun for the whole family! Plus, there's a wonderful sex scene between two rival naval commanders. The exact same scenario helped resolve the Battle of Midway in world war 2.

It's not historically accurate, other than the fact that Greek and Persian navies did exist and fight each other. As long as you weren't planning on showing this to your 9th grade history class, or doing research for a ""History of Western Civilizations"" class, you could probably just understand that it's a movie, and an OK one. Not terrible, not great.

The plot goes something like this: Hermaphracleetes (or whatever his name was) is the Greek naval commander, and must fight of a much larger force of Persian ships led by Princess Boobula (or something). They fight, they hump, they fight, someone else humps, someone else fights, the end. I've seen cinemax films at 2am on Friday that had more plot. However, there is something appealing about watching freedom fight against tyranny, few fight against many, and boobs.

5605962,2,B00BEJL6JK,"This movie is pretty bad.  Inevitably if you're renting this you probably liked the first.  Well this one does little or nothing to develop the characters.  I partially expected it to pick up with Dilios and how he gets to the point at the very end of the first movie where he leads the remaining Spartan army and the rest of the Greeks against the Persians.  Instead the movie revolves around Themistocles and Artemisia, a female Persian commander of Greek origin.  As far as I know Artemisia was a minor commander among others in the Persian navy and advised Xerxes against attacking the Greeks at Salamis but we'll ignore that.  It pretty much mirrors the original story about Leonidas and Xerxes, Artemisia promises to give Themistocles everything if he joins the Persians he says no blah blah blah.

Overall the movie does little to develop the characters.  The original went far to develop Leonidas' life as king and relationship with his wife.  You felt Leonidas was carrying all of Greece on his shoulders and fighting for a moral purpose.  There is no such feeling for Themistocles.  The battle scene of Salamis scene is very short and the movie lacks a real ""epic"" battle or skirmish where the Greeks destroy the enemy on masse.  As soon as one starts getting going the movie fades any some comic drawing scene and ends.

Overall this movie is boring and lacks any battle scene even remotely comparable to the ones in the original movie.  If you must get your 300 fix rent the original and watch it again.",1404604800,,1515,4.6893939393939394

The one dimensional ""good vs. evil"" theme is taken to a cloying extreme.  Worse, is that the action is dull and unfulfilling.  The naval battles lack any tension and resolve abruptly.  The story of the making of Xerxes is ridiculous and has us believe that as a god-king, he is then manipulated by his foreign, adopted sister.

This film is an attempt for duplicate the success of the original film 300. Unfortunately the magic for me was just not as strong. There were some good battle scenes and the acting and story line was not bad but the CGI blood was just over the top. It was done for dramatic effect but it turned a reasonably good story and film into a cartoon.

I liked that the sea battle was a major part of the film and the strategy was interesting to see. There are some strong scenes with sexual content and they are pretty graphic. The film for me tried so hard for a shock factor that it lost its meaning as a good film.

If you like graphic novels, this is a must see. The Film starts as a pace that you think that it must slow down after ten minutes but it never does. Awesome script, awesome direction, awesome actors.....

One of the best films (of its genre) that I have every seen. One disclaimer, the level of adult content and graphic violence is off the charts and is should probably be viewed in its entirety before allowing children n to to see.

5606146,3,B00BEJL6JK,"This movie teeters on the edge of greatness in a couple scenes, but falls short far too often.

When the villains are more interesting and easier to empathize with, you know something is wrong.  In fact, if not for the villains in this film, I would have stopped watching.

Eva Green's Artemisia steals the show.  I'd watch a movie just about her!  In fact, she is the only character developed to any length.  And, seriously, after you learn a bit about her, you might just be rooting for the Persians.

Second to her is Rodrigo's weakling transformed into a ""godking"", Xerxes.  But he does not feature enough to hold our interest.

The ONE exciting hero in this movie is played by Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo, Leonidas' wife), but she only pops up briefly.

Frankly, Themistocles and his gang are BORING, BLAND, and often spout corny dialogue to each other.  Here's the main problem: There is NO character development for the ""heroes""!!!  How do these silly film makers expect us to CARE about cardboard cut-out Greeks!?!

Sorry to point this out, but Stapleton is not a very expressive or charismatic actor to begin with.  If you do not build his character and our sympathies, you are sure to fail.  No matter how much fake blood and violence you throw at us.

Violence.  This is where the film succeeds.  There is a lot to admire here.  Many cool battle scenes.

A few acts of stupidity too: 1) riding a horse across burning, crumbling ships for no discernible reason (he could have ran); 2) taking off helmets in the course of battle--even though an arrow just bounced off your helm and a few companions got arrows through the eyeballs recently; 3) leaping off of a cliff that would break Iron Man's legs and yet landing without a twinge of pain.  You get the idea.

But most of the film is reasonably exciting naval warfare.  Great special effects too.  Except for the blood, which looks like Smucker's strawberry jam.

I walked into this film knowing that as long as Frank Miller and Zack Snyder were backing this it was going to be tolerable and it was a much better film than I anticipated. I enjoyed it for a few reasons. As mentioned before Miller and Snyder were credited in the production. The fact that it was once again very accurate to the novel it was based on. Casting Eva Green for the lead vileness, because she made the movie inciting and that much more fun. Also there were a lot of links to the original film and even a few surprise cast members make a showing. The only issue I had with the film was that I thought the blood splatter effects were a little over done and much more cartoonish than the first installment. Still, that was not a make or break matter as the film really stuck to the things that made the first one such a landmark.

They either needed to develop the plot more to connect the second movie to the first more strongly, or eliminate the tie entirely. The weak tie-in made the whole plot seem underdeveloped.

Not only is her character completely annoying, she is not likeable at all! And top of all of that, I think she is wearing one of those ""Bump Its"" that women wear to pump up the back of their hair. It distracted me the entire film. Villains have to be likeable on some level, but no matter how hard I search, there is nothing remotely endearing.

The special effects were pretty good; however, they really pumped up the amount of slow-motion scenes to just about every thirty seconds.

5606498,4,B00BEJL6JK,"This movie acts as part prequel, part sequel and part parallel to the original 300 movie.  Like the first movie it is a very fictionalized, loosely based adaptation of historical events.  While the first film dealt with the land invasion of the Persian invasion of Greece, this one primarily deals with the naval battle that occurred roughly at the same time.

There are some flashbacks to the events that occurred in the original movie, and some of the characters from the first film have relatively minor roles.  Lena Headey's character Queen Gorgo narrates this film, and is seen in glimpses throughout until the end of the movie when she has a larger role.  Xerxes is back as well, and we see his origins as the ""god king"" and he again makes appearances throughout the movie, although his role is not as large as in the first.

This movie really revolves around the characters of Themistokles (played by Sullivan Stapleton) and the female Persian naval commander Artemisia (played by Eva Green).  While she does provide the usual eye candy she does in a lot of her movies she came off as a strong, fierce, and slightly crazy warrior.  Like the first movie, there is a lot of action going on.  The camera plays between real-time speed and slow-motion shots in the battles, and there is a lot of dismemberment and gushing blood.  Because some of the battles were at night, on the water, it was not always as easy to tell exactly what was going on.  But whenever in doubt just assume someone was getting an arm or leg chopped off.

For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds great as expected.  There is about an hours worth of bonus features, the most interesting to me being the comparison between as much as we know about the historical events and real people against the fictional version of the film.

You basically know what you are getting if you watch this.  It is not a documentary meant to be a historical reenactment.  It is highly fictionalized, way over the top and unrealistic.  It is meant to be visually stunning and entertaining, and if you like films in the same genre, and liked the first movie, chances are you will like this one.",1404086400,,2166,4.598958333333333

Did Artemisia really have a hunger for warfare?
Yes. Herodotus, also known as the ""Father of History,"" makes numerous references to Artemisia as he recounts the events of the Greco-Persian war. He describes her as a ruler who did not lead passively, and instead, actively engaged herself in both adventure and warfare. ""her brave spirit and manly daring sent her forth to the war, when no need required her to adventure. Her name, as I said, was Artemisia..."" -The Histories

Was Artemisia really known for her cunning tactics and intelligence in combat?
Yes. In exploring the 300: Rise of an Empire true story, we came upon the works of Polyaenus, the 2nd century Macedonian writer. He describes an example of the real Artemisia's intelligence in combat. He tells of how she would carry two flags on board her ship, one a Persian flag and the other the flag of her enemy, Greece. Artemisia would fly the Greek flag as she approached an unsuspecting Greek warship. Once she was upon her enemy, she would then unleash the full force of her Carian fleet.

Were the Greeks really angered that a woman had taken up arms against them?
Yes. According to Herodotus, the united Greeks even offered a reward of 10,000 drachmas for Artemisia's capture.

Was Themistocles really responsible for Greek's strong navy?
Yes. Themistocles always believed in building up the Athenian navy. After his political obstacle in the form of his rival Aristides had been voted into exile, Themistocles got his wish for a stronger navy. Knowing that a Persian invasion was imminent, the Athenians voted to build even more ships than Themistocles requested, leaving Athens with the most dominant naval force in all of Greece.

In fact If the Director was aiming for a dartboard, and the bulls eye of the dartboard was ""great movie"", the Director apparently was drunk and didn't even through the dart in the first place.

5606716,4,B00BEJL6JK,"This review will actually cover both ""300"" movies because they are really companion films; almost sequential stories.  Beautifully
photographed, terrific cast and lots and lots of blood splattering gore.  If one is a historical nut of ancient history and lore one should
really like these films if one can look past the awful errors in the stories (intentional I think).  in 3OO there is no mention of the fact
that Sparta had two Kings; one stayed in Sparta to control the population that was essentially slaves, even the free ones.  Sparta
was a police state with a citizen body of at best 50,000.  The rest of the population of several hundred thousand were disenfranchised
serfs in effect, and could be killed without punishment by the authorities.  Not a pleasant country to live in.  The second King
Leonidas led the army as portrayed in the film.  And he was killed at the Hot Gates as shown in the movie.  But hearing the Spartans
talk about Freedom is like Stalin talking about love.  They did heroically stop the Persians for a spell at the Hot Gates temporarily
though the Persians finally moved on after the 300 and some other Greeks were dead.  Athens was later burned to the ground.
 What bothered me the most is the way the Persians were portrayed in the first film.  Persians are Indo-Europeans closely related
to the Europeans.  The name IRAN means Aryan, what Indo-Euros used to be called until you-know-who misused the name.
The first film seemed to suggest that the Persians were of various races and they were not; the second 300 seemed to have
corrected that issue.
  In the second film, history goes haywire in the stories.  I know of no Artemisia and Xerxes looked like an escapee from a
leather bar in Greenwich village (also in the first film).  The movie tries to explain His Weirdness away due to the murder-death
of his father King Darius.  All Persian Kings had beards; probably a religious thing.  Now the portrayal of Thermistolkes (?) or as
I will call him from now on as THERMI, was accurately portrayed  as least reasonably well.  Very Well done.  And the sea battles
were spectacular though probably way over played;  Still I liked it all. except for the nonsense of the big iron ship full of oil. Did the
ancients know of Texas ""T"" back then?  No way could the ancients cast large Iron plates for the ship  much less make it float!!
Still perhaps I am forgetting these films were not intended to be exact, just entertaining and I found them, especially the first one
to be first rate  even with the silly nonsenses.  The Spartans uniforms were pretty accurate except they always wore breast plates
and not speedos. But most of the costuming of the actors and actresses was very accurate (except for Xerxes!!!) and Sparta was
shown exactly how it probably looked back then; very simple and plain..rather boring!  By the way, I would love to exile Dr Sweets
and Daisy to Sparta!  When I first saw the second 300 I wasn't I liked it, but I got the DVD from Amazon and in my quiet little room
relaxed and watched it again. I decided now to get the 3D version (Amazon).  I would liked to have a bit more at the end of the
film, but I can live with the way it ended.  I do recommend it for Greek-Roman buffs.  I gave it four stars, would have been five
if Xerxes had been portrayed more ""normally"".  enjoy!",1403827200,,3337,4.581081081081081

5606750,3,B00BEJL6JK,"300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE is a frustrating, but fitfully entertaining companion piece to 300. I say companion piece, because the events of this film take place before, during and after the events of 300. As such, this movie can't really stand on its own and suffers by comparison to the original, which was a much-better-told story. To put it another way, this movie is essentially the same underdog story as the first, only transplanted to the sea. A few characters from the previous film are carried over, and even those that aren't have analogues in this one. The plot revolves around Themistocles and Artemisia, who represent Athens and the Persian empire, respectively. Themistocles is a legendary warrior who reportedly killed Darius at the battle of Marathon, and Artemisia is a Greek woman who was rescued by the Persians and rose to command their navy. Their dynamic is what is supposed to drive the movie, and it largely fails to do so, with the exception of a hilarious sex scene which takes place midway through the film. These two try their best, but they are largely unable to make up for the absence of Gerard Butler here, creating a sort of charisma vacuum. Where the original was kind of tongue-in-cheek when it came to the jingoistic and ham-handed dialogue, this one takes it mostly seriously. Not only content to suck the joy out of the ridiculousness of seeing perfectly ripped men kill the mess out of each other, the early battle sequences are oppressive and borderline repulsive in the level of digital blood and gore on display, as if increasingly stylized violence could make up for the lack of investment in the story. Granted, the visuals are impressive, and an improvement over the original, but it just felt soulless and empty. There was also overuse of slow motion, and 10-15 minutes could have been shaved off if they'd shown most of the battle sequences at normal speed. The only sequence which I was truly interested in was the final one, and by then it was a little late to make me care in what was happening onscreen. As far as acting is concerned, nobody really gave a bad performance, but nobody was really that great either. Eva Green was the standout, and did a good job of chewing the scenery, but she never really let loose until she meets face-to-face with Sullivan Stapleton's Themistocles. There was also some palpable energy with her performance in the final moments of the film. Returning from the original film are Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, and Rodrigro Santoro as Xerxes. However, Lena Headey is relegated to being the ""Queen of Exposition"" and narrator for most of the running time, while Xerxes is largely absent due to his being occupied with the Spartans at Thermopylae. Still, they are each given a moment where they can shine. On a technical level, the film is incredible. There was an incredible level of detail, mostly augmented by CGI, but still beautiful to look at nonetheless. The battle sequences, this time involving ships, were also well-filmed and easy to follow. The only negative I can draw here is, again, the overuse of digital blood. There was a lot in the original 300, but there's fountains and geysers of it here, almost to the point of nausea. On the other side, a positive I can find was the score, which hit all the right beats and fit the movie quite well. I also liked the use of ""War Pigs"" in the closing credits, which was also used for one of the promotional trailers. Overall, the film more than a mite disappointing, given my affection for what preceded it. The story largely failed to be engaging, and often felt like a rehash, and it tried to compensate for that with  even more outlandish and stylized violence, to the point where I felt like it glamorized it. Still, as visual spectacle, it was second to none. Would I recommend it? No. There simply isn't enough going on to warrant spending your money, and when it finally kicks into gear in the final act, it's a little too late.",1403827200,5,3967,4.699712643678161

5606793,4,B00BEJL6JK,"""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"" - Captain Oveur from ""Airplane!""

Indeed, the newest ""300"" film is a solid entry into the storied canon of ""swords and sandals"" movies. Fans of this particular genre will not be disappointed. What perhaps makes this entry better than most others are thrilling naval battles, stunning cinematography, and sumptuous special effects. Everything is choreographed to present the historical conflicts with surreal and fantastic visuals in epic landscapes of war.

In many ways, this film is a faithful followup to the original classic. However, while the first one had a straightforward story, this one is diluted by numerous parties and their politicking around the conflict. While the primary villain is played with psychotic abandon, the uncharismatic hero is this movie's worst flaw. The first movie featured one of cinema's classic protagonists, the headstrong and wild Spartan king Leonidas. I'll never forget leaving the theater after ""300"" and listening to a pack of teenagers debating what kind of tattoo they would get to immortalize their love of that film.

But this outing features a much more calm and diplomatic hero. The Athenian Themistocles may be one of the finest warriors in all of Greece as well, but he is also boring and one-dimensional. The same can be said of his forgettable compatriots. No one is rushing out to get any tattoos here.

Still, even when the film devolves into talking heads filling time between battles, the rich backgrounds and color still make the film compelling and artistic. And then the numerous fights are all top-notch, escalating in frenzied insanity with near super-heroic endeavors from all.",1403740800,,1684,5.225925925925926

The story was good, the action was groundbreaking and it left a lasting impression of awesomeness. 300: Rise of Empire is not even close to how good 300 was. Rise of Empire takes what made 300 good and stuffs it in your mouth until you're sick of it. The whole movie is nothing but slow motion and blood spraying with a barely passable storyline and almost no dialogue. Even the action isn't that great and looks phony and cheesy.

While 300 took some dramatic license with historical facts and events, I felt it was close enough to be realistic in its plot.  Sure they added some Hollywood cheesiness, but the valor of Leonidas and his 300 Spartiates (yeah they left out the fact that the Spartan helots and small contingents of other Greeks helped hold the pass but it IS Hollywood) was depicted in a way that triggered an emotional response.  Rise of an Empire took all the worst of 300 and destroyed all the best, creating a horrible movie, with awful characters, pathetic dialogue, annoying effects, and a story that went so far into the ridiculous that it ceased to be just dramatic license.  I usually force myself to sit through it even when a movie sucks to see how it ends, but this one was so horrible I just could not do it. (I can count on one hands the number of times that has happened.) Artemisia was just an obnoxious beetch and they failed to bring out the real life genius of Themistocles.

5606866,2,B00BEJL6JK,"This verdict contains SPOILERS

This High Court finds the accused, producer and writer of this sequel to his own 2006 splendid masterpiece, guilty as charged of following crimes:

1. Being too lazy to direct this second film

2. Hiring a director who is an absolutely incompetent beginner

3. Being careless (or drunk?) to the point of writing a completely substandard BORING scenario

4. Endorsing abysmally bad actors for two main roles

5. Flashing ugly silicon breasts in public

6. Sending to the front Cersei Lannister, a middle aged mother of three, dressed in a dirty nightgown and armed with a rusty meat cleaver

7. Not only using napalm in V century BC but especially using it poorly...

8. Transforming Xerxes, the gigantic King of Kings, a monument of evil, corruption and depravation, into a pathetic sidekick

9. Showing the battle of Salamis, an apocalyptic clash of fleets and warriors on a scale defying imagination, as a sh...y little skirmish won by a cavalry charge (sic!)

10. Replacing a Bad@ss Leonidas by a Couldn't Care Less Themistocles, who has all the ""maiestas, dignitas et gravitas"" of an used condom, when the REAL Themistocles was a titan of politics, a genius of warfare, a monument of charisma and also a man of legendary oratory talent - for Christ sake, in order to ensure the final victory in war this guy actually managed to convince the assembly of Athenian citizens to abandon their own beautiful and rich city without fighting so it can be plundered and burned to the ground by Persians!

11. Presenting Ancient Greeks, one of the most warlike, aggressive, clever, dangerous people who EVER lived, as some kind of pacific clueless herbivores... For the love of God, Ancient Greeks were not just mere farmers, herders, artisans, merchants, fishermen and sailors - in fact EVERY single citizen was trained in a very harsh way to fight from his early childhood. All those who could afford appropriate armor and weapons would become hoplits (heavy infantry) with all others becoming peltasts (light infantry of javelin armed skirmishers). As soon as he was of age every citizen participated in wars of his city (""polis"") and those conflicts were many, because fighting, together with philosophy and pederasty, was the favourite pastime for Ancient Greeks. Wars were almost permanent and were waged for any kind of reasons - sometimes to start one it was enough to spit over the border, on another city-state territory (not a tall order, considering the small size of most of Ancient Greek statelets). In fact it is a small wonder that Ancient Greeks invented Olympic games, which forced all the states to stop fighting once every four years - after all EVERYBODY needs a break from time to time... By trying to show Ancient Greeks as peaceful people invaded by an evil empire this film is simply RIDICULOUS!

12. Showing on the screen the most appalling scene of unsuccessful copulation ever...

13. For all practical purpose destroying a promising franchise

14. Causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat

15. Making people vomit in disgust in the theatres and therefore causing a public health hazard

16. Abundantly humidifying his own legacy with malodorous body fluids...

Sentencing: the film receives two stars for some nice images; this court also sentences the accused to a total of no less than five thousand and no more than ten thousand obligatory consecutive viewings of all Jar Jar Binks scenes from ""Phantom Menace"", 8 (eight hours) per day, seven days per week, allowing during those 8 hours only short toilet and coffee breaks and one 15 minutes lunch break. The shades of 300 Spartans are charged with supervision of the sentence.

Consequently,  I remembered that those reviews are the expressed views of some one else and those views are just ones opinion(remember John Carter!!!). It is a true fact that you can't please everyone; so you are going to have positive and negative opinions about everything under the sun. My advice is simple go into any situation with an open mind and at the end form your own opinion. I went into this movie with the understanding that not all sequels or prequels are as good or worst as the first and I can truly say that my wife and I really enjoyed the movie. We started out watching it in 2d but after seeing various effects we decided to watch it in 3d and it was a very enjoyable experience. This movie isn't intended  for every one but for those who like these types of movies may be surprised that they may like it. It is a 100% better than The Legend of Hercules (in my opinion) and some people liked that; it only goes to show you that every one has an opinion.

5606921,3,B00BEJL6JK,"""300:  Rise of an Empire"" is better than ""300,"" if only because they don't depict the Persians as an invading army of outer space mutants bent on the destruction of ancient Greece like ""300"" did.

The movie has some dazzling visuals ranging from hand to hand combat to the vast naval battles that the Greeks and Persians fought.

But certain things didn't work for me.  The Greeks like the ones in ""300"" came across as superhuman sometimes, killing the Persians as easily as if they were killing defenseless children.

<spoilers>

Another thing that didn't work for me was Themistocles riding a horse from ship to ship, including one ablaze from stem to stern.  I know war horses could be trained not to panic but that seems to push it a bit.  Also, unlike a lot of the action, that whole bit looked rather fake to me.

Another mistake to me was not spending more time showing Artemesia.  I hope the film makers are at least considering a prequel type movie that shows her bloody career in more detail. She was a lot more interesting than a lot of the Greek characters mouthing platitudes about ""the Greek nation"" and ""democracy.""

A final big mistake was resorting to a classic deus ex machina where the Spartans come sailing to the rescue at the height of the Battle of Salamis.  I hate those sorts of plot contrivances.

5606927,4,B00BEJL6JK,"I really wanted to just rent this, but that wasn't an option.  Still, I'll probably watch it again.  As noted in the Trivia and Goofs in this 2d installment, the story is a bit convoluted, but still interesting.  If you ever saw the ""original"" ""300 Spartans"", you saw Leonidas and Themistocles working to defeat the Persian fleet, which that story alludes to.  Here, in ""300: Rise of an Empire"" we finally see how this happened.  Of course Themistocles didn't kill King Darius II with that arrow, but regardless, this just allowed us to see Xerses become ruler and vow vengeance upon the Greeks, specifically Athens.  In fact, Xerses isn't mentioned that much in this version as it focuses more on the two main adversaries, Themistocles and Queen Artemisia.  She has her own agenda.  The story starts out with Themistocles trying to gather the Greeks to support him and his navy to confront the Persians.  The Spartan Queen Gorgo is reluctant as her husband and his bodyguard have left to battle the Persians.  For about half of the movie, there are references made to the 300 Spartans holding off the Persians at Thermopylae.  We are finally told they have been defeated.  Following that, the Athenian fleet is nearly destroyed and Persia begins sacking the Greek states.  But like the Phoenix bird, the Greeks rise up, putting their faith in Themistocles, but with only a small fleet (6 vs 1000's?) but rejected by Queen Gorgo of Sparta, having already sacrificed her husband and his '300'.  What more did Greece want?  Well, they needed the Spartan fleet which Queen Gorgo refuses.
I liked the sea battles, but some just seemed over the top with computer graphics, especially near the end when Themistocles rides his horse across sinking ships to reach Artemisia.  Finally,in true hero spirit,  the Spartan fleet shows up and basically saves the day and the Persians are defeated in their quest to rule the Greeks.",1403568000,,1917,4.867283950617284
5606928,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Sometimes there are movies that escaped me along the way. A film that, for whatever reason, I never caught in the theater or on Blu-ray / DVD. One such ridiculous example of my oversight is Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300."" I've always wanted to see it and heard how great it was. The fact that it was based on a graphic novel by the same genius who wrote ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Batman: Year One"" makes the whole situation more unacceptable. To make matters even worse for myself, I did the unthinkable. I watched ""300: Rise of an Empire"" before seeing the original.

Some will gasp in utter disgust and immediately stop reading this review. Others will find my fresh eyes and impartial opinion of the sequel a breath of fresh air. I went into ""300: Rise of An Empire"" with nothing to compare it to or any preconceived notions of what it should be. All that being said, I found the movie to be an entertaining (if not completely accurate) telling of the Battle of Salamis.

After his defeat of Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, Persian god-king Xerxes marches forward toward the city-states of Greece. With Athens as the first stop on his path of destruction, the city's admiral Themistocles must lead his garrison of soldiers against Xerxes and his new vengeful ally, Persian naval commander Artemisia. Will his soldiers fight alone, or can Themistocles convince Leonidas's widow to send the Spartans into the fight again?

Director Noam Murro brings every gory element you would expect from an R-rated sword-and-sandal epic to ""300: Rise of an Empire."" There are no quick slashes or splashes of blood to be found here. Every swing of a sword and puncturing of skin is slowed down to give viewers the optimum amount of time to take in all the bodily harm and decapitations.

I will say that at times the narrative parts of ""300: Rise of an Empire"" seemed like minor segue ways to the different fight scenes put in front of us. However, Screenwriters Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad did do a good job of weaving the backstories of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and Artemisia (Eva Green) into all the bloodshed and action. Santoro is as equally creepy in ""Rise of an Empire"" as he is in the first film. Green comes very close to stealing the show and making the ""manly"" Spartans and the Persian armies both look like sissy boys.

""300: Rise of an Empire"" is rated R for strong sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence throughout, a sex scene, nudity, and some language. The sex scene is quite graphic and borders on sadomasochism. I found some of the bad language to be a little out of place for a period piece.

The DVD version of ""300: Rise of an Empire"" comes with some ""behind-the-scenes"" bonus material for viewers. Featurettes include ""The 300 Effect,"" ""3 Days in Hell,"" Brutal Artistry,"" and ""A New Breed of Hero."" The extra feature ""Taking the Battle to the Sea"" is made up of sections entitled ""Real Leaders & Legends,"" ""Women Warriors,"" ""Savage Warships,"" and ""Becoming a Warrior.""

I did watch the superior ""300"" the next night to see what I'd been missing all these years. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" does a great job following up the original. Director Murro and Cinematographer Simon Duggan do a great job mimicking what Zack Snyder and Larry Fong created. It definitely feels like a direct extension of ""300,"" which it should. This is the perfect example of imitation being the best form of flattery.

""300: Rise of an Empire"" is available on 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download.",1403568000,,3535,4.717990275526742

5606948,3,B00BEJL6JK,"As a Frank Miller fan from way back, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's adaptation of Sin City was thrilling to watch as the pages and panels found their way to the screen, and 'adaptation' meant something different the day after it opened. Zach Snyder continued with 300 what Sin City started, using not just Miller's story, but his heavily stylized chiaroscuro artwork and Lynn Varley's painted colors to create a blood-drenched realization that perfectly interpreted his vision of Thermopylae.

This sequel jumps back and forward in time to give the audience a proper perspective of how Leonidas' and the 300 Spartans deaths related to the Athenians and the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. Eva Green, who is everywhere nowadays (and apparently has to do at least one topless scene per movie -- not that I'm complaining), plays a vicious Naval Commander for the God-King, Xerxes, and gives the best performance of the cast, and most of the memorable scenes. The Greek hero of the film, Themistocles, is played by Sullivan Stapleton (one of many relatively new faces in lead roles), who has hit the gym and practiced his angry face in the mirror, but lacks the charisma of Gerard Butler.

The fact that the movie was rushed to screens before Frank Miller could finish the graphic novel it is based on was not a good sign. The fact that Zach Snyder decided to hand off directing chores to someone else and stick to producing was not a good sign. I was afraid that this movie would fail completely for those reasons; without the distinctive vision of Frank Miller and Zach Snyder, all you have is a historical drama straight out of Herodotus. I would be fine with that, actually: I thought Wolfgang Peterson's 'Troy', particularly the director's cut, was incredible; HBO's 'Rome' tops even 'The Wire' or 'Game of Thrones' on my Top 5 TV Series List; and 'I, Claudius', 'Claudius the God' and 'Count Belisarius' by Robert Graves are among my favorite books... but this is the follow-up to 300, and people expect something different, electrifying.

That said, the movie has some good points, and much of the action is engrossing. But it doesn't have the riveting intensity of 300, and the cinematography, the CGI, the aesthetic of the film seems forced -- the settings from the original were saved, so they put everything on autopilot. 3/5",1403481600,,2345,4.87218045112782

After the fall of the 300 lead by King Leonidas the Persian army led by Artemisia (Green) has become more bold and has decided to launch an attack the Greece beginning with the city-state of Athens. General Themistokles (Stapleton) is in charge of stopping the charge and his best hope is to get the Athenian army to help him, but the bad history between the two factions make the alliance difficult to set up. I have to start be saying that I wasn't a fan of the first one, really at all. I thought it looked neat and different but I am just not a fan of this type of genre. That said going into this one I wasn't that excited at all. Even with that expectation this was still a movie I just could not get into at all. The movie itself isn't sure what it wanted to be. It is at the same time a prequel, sequel and companion to the original. What I mean is the movie jumps around from taking place before King Leonidas' march to death, during the 300 fighting and after the death of the 300. While that may seem like a neat idea what the movie turned out to be is fight scene...remember this part from the first one.....fight scene....remember this part in the first one...fight scene....etc.... The style of the original was new a different and looked cool. This one relies too have on the slow down/speed up camera tricks that it becomes distracting and nauseating. The blood splatters are also too over the top that it almost becomes comical. Most sequels are made because they have something else to say or do with the characters, this has none of that. Even though it takes place before, during and after the 300 movie it almost felt like a boring paint-by-numbers remake more then anything. All this said though keep in mind I wasn't a fan of the original. Overall, if you liked the first one you will probebly enjoy this one as well.

This one starts before the first movies set of events, which is pretty much mostly one big battle scene. The first movie happens in the middle of the second movie and then the second movie continues to the end of the story. Its hard to explain. There is a Spartan dude Themis, who is battling the Persian navy for the Greeks. There are a few big sea battle sequences. At one point during the movie, goes to ask Leonidis for his help, so he get his 300 men together and go and fight the Persians and lose, but because they lose, they get more people to help with his sea battle because they are angry about what the Persians did to the 300. Its kind of like what happened at the Alamo, All those people died which caused more people to be angry and take up arms to help Sam Huston defeat Santa Ana. Its an interesting concept for a sequel. It doesnt really have much of a plot, just some dialogue in between these crazy bloody battle sequences. Not the most terribly deep profound movie, but it held my interest. Its a pretty fun movie and it doesnt make itself out to be anymore than it is. If you are squeamish about blood, it may be pretty intense because the blood comes right out at you and there is a lot of it. Its so excessive though, its hard to take seriously.

5607079,5,B00BEJL6JK,"A heap of bodies only partially explains the seven-year wait for a follow to 300, Zack Snyders ancient Greek affair in which Gerard Butler and 299 beefcake bros nakedly took on multitudinous Persians with only their swords and sweat.

Butlers Spartan King Leonidas and his men achieved a beautiful victory  not to mention great box office  but sadly lost their heads. A prequel seemed the obvious path, but then Butler went sitcom soft and Snyder opted for stories of super dudes in leotards.

So the mere existence of 300: Rise of an Empire is worthy of note, especially the inventive means by which the story has been advanced. Neither prequel nor sequel (maybe we should call it equal), it looks at the other Greeks versus Persians clash that was happening around the same ancient time as 300s Battle of Thermopylae.

As any history book (or Google) will tell you, this is the aquatic skirmish on the Aegean Sea. The Greeks are once against vastly outnumbered by invading Persians, and here we meet the secret weapon of Rise of an Empire: women.

This highly stylized account, drawn as before from a graphic novel by Frank Miller but under the direction this time of Israels Noam Murro, has a vibrant lead in Eva Green, best known as Bond girl Vesper Lynd from Casino Royale.

As Artemisia, commander of the Persian navy, she dresses Goth but acts Amazon. To say she takes no prisoners is like saying Godzilla doesnt have a calling card. Presented with an unworthy male, she summarily beheads him, theatrically kisses the severed noggin and then flings it contemptuously away.

Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, especially one packing two lethal blades. And although Artemisia is of Greek blood, shes seeking payback against her countrymen for the raping and pillaging visited upon her family and town in her childhood, and for the killing of Persian King Darius (Igal Naor), the man who rescued her and trained her as a warrior.

Darius took a fatal arrow fired by the Greek warrior Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), an event so important to the movie, Murro shows us the flashback twice, in case we missed the point. (Snyder and his 300 co-writer Kurt Johnstad penned the screenplay.)

As fate would have it, Themistokles now leads the Greek naval resistance against Persia, and Artemisia aims to seduce, corrupt and kill him, not necessarily in that order.

And shes great, giving Rise of an Empire some badly needed energy beyond the endless grunting and sepia-toned blood-spilling of the rest of the picture, which does manage to make good use of widescreen 3D. Heads split, breasts bulge, bodies slam and ships collide with authority.

The estrogen-enriched production also includes the return of Game of Thrones Lena Headey as Spartan Queen Gorgo, aggrieved widow of Leonidas, who also swings a mean knife but gets considerably less screen time than Green.

Together they help make up for the absence of Butler, who is seen only in flashback, and for Stapletons serviceable yet unmemorable portrayal of the top Greek seaman.

Making even less of an impression, apart from a sartorial one, is Rodrigo Santoro as returning god-man Xerxes, the heavily pierced peacock who watches the action mainly from the sidelines while Artemisia does the heavy lifting. We do get to see how he became a god while visiting a spa, but it inspires snickers rather than shudders.

None of the men in Rise of an Empire are a match for Artemisias tongue, which is sharper than her twin blades.

Given the choice between hearing her withering assessment of your sexual prowess, or having her shove a sword into your guts, you might just go for the sword. Ouch!",1402876800,,3654,4.878836833602585

5607083,5,B00BEJL6JK,"The first Persian invasion of Greece, during the Persian Wars, began in 492 BCE, and ended with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius I primarily in order to punish the city-states of Athens and Eretria. These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.

The first campaign in 492 BCE, led by Mardonius, re-subjugated Thrace and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia. However, further progress was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.

The second campaign, in 490 BCE, was under the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The expedition headed first to the island Naxos, which it captured and burnt. It then island-hopped between the rest of the Cycladic Islands, annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to Attica, landing at Marathon, en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of Marathon.

This defeat prevented the successful conclusion of the campaign, and the task force returned to Asia. Nevertheless, the expedition had fulfilled most of its aims, punishing Naxos and Eretria, and bringing much of the Aegean under Persian rule. The unfinished business from this campaign led Darius to prepare for a much larger invasion of Greece, to firmly subjugate it, and to punish Athens and Sparta. However, internal strife within the empire delayed this expedition, and Darius then died of old age. It was thus left to his son Xerxes I to lead the second Persian invasion of Greece, beginning in 480 BCE",1402790400,,2407,5.104060913705584

People bring it up to me, there are signs about it all over the island and when I look out to sea I can't help by remember.

As a sequel, well it falls pretty damn short of the expectations.

I give it three stars simply for the story aspect.  It has back story, explains things more clearly, and follows a linear time frame compared to the first movie.

If you were expecting an epic battle with the thousands of spartan warriors on the battlefield (as the ending of the original suggested) well you won't get that.  It leads up to that so to say, but doesn't give it to you.

The ship battles are alright, that's the entire movie is a naval battlefield.  It offers the same slow mo killing style, but the blood graphics were lazy compared to the first movie.

The sex scene in the movie was just a toss in for sex...that's it.  Pointless, a complete disregard for the main protagonists character, and overall kind of odd.  It also takes away quite a bit from the overall feel of evil from the main antagonist.  It almost makes you like her and hope she comes back to the light so to say.

The movie also made Xerxes seem like an insecure little brat with daddy issues.

interesting and fast action movie, the historical part is really ""confused"" not to use another word.
Still, no one really will watch it for the historical value, so if you don't pay attention to that
(for me it was a little difficult been a Greek), then it is a regular movie, fun to watch, and not
a bad sequel. Too much splatter, no ""This is Sparta"" moment, but full of male six packs, action
scenes, and great visual effects.
The one thing that really bothered me where the slow motion scenes. It seemed half of the movie

overused that it felt that the other half of the movie was in fast forward.

The Mad God King Xerxes and his giant army continue their attack on Greece as six-packed soldiers fight them. Usually in slow motion.

What did I think?

Breasts, blood and slow-motion violence. The latter two to excess. On paper this sequel (technically a companion piece) offers more, more, more. More blood, more gore, more effects. And yet somehow you feel shortchanged.

It could be the irritatingly repetitive effects that are impressively stylish at first but wearing after the 30th time. Or the fact the story attempts to be complex but fails.

Luckily you're so distracted by Eva Greens AMAZING turn as a psychotic villain bent on revenge that you will leave pretty happy. She has slashed her way into my top five movie villains of all-time with an intense performance that has you occasionally cheering for the bad guys. Rather than a third 300 film lets have an Artemisia prequel.

Its a mid-range bloody popcorn flick. Now can someone just explain to me why there are particles hanging in the air everywhere in Greek cities?",1401667200,2,1053,4.887640449438202
5607345,4,B00BEJL6JK,"While giving this review I'll try to avoid spoilers while painting a general idea of what was happening and keeping the review short.

300: Rise of an Empire stars Sullivan Stapleton as General Themistocles of Athens, Eva Green as Artemisia who was a naval commander for Persia, Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo of Sparta, and Rodrigo Santoro as King Xerxes of Persia. It was directed by Zack Snyder who directed films such as '300' and 'Man of Steel'.

This movie is fictionalized but is based on and focuses on the events before and during the Battle of Salamis (naval war) and is happening along side the original film 300 which was the Battle of Thermopylae (the hot gates). The movie is narrated by Queen Gorgo and starts out with her recounting the Battle of Marathon where Themistocles fires an arrow hitting King Darius of Persia which later ends up being the cause of his death. Artemisia convinces Xerxes (son of King Darius) to become a 'God King' because 'only the gods could defeat the greeks'. She sends Xerxes off into the desert where he wanders for some time until he finds a cave and bathes in a strange gold liquid. He emerges covered in the gold liquid with all of his jewelry and has completed his transformation into a God-King. He then returns to his throne to declare war on Greece, ""For glory's sake, war!""

Now we have Xerxes sending his forces towards Thermopylae, Themistocles going to Sparta to ask for help from King Leonidas only to find he is seeking guidance from the Oracle, and Queen Gorgo is conflicted with helping the Athenians. Still following? Okay, good. So those are the examples of how the movie sets up, gives you a background of what's going on and how events are taking place during the same time as the original 300 film. It continues on to show the fall of King Leonidas and his 300 men from the first movie, it's kind of like an extended ending of 300 at this part of the film. And unlike the first movie, 300: Rise of an Empire focuses primarily on naval warfare which the film is based on (Battle of Salamis). At first I was a little skeptical how the director would manage to pull this off but it was successful. I enjoyed this movie just as much as the original 300. Expect plenty of death, limbs flying off, blood spattering the screen, 6 pack abs, slo-mo fight scenes, a sex scene, and nudity (Eva Green).

This is a good action film with quality acting that takes a very different approach with the naval warfare aspect and how the story is told. The main emotions depicted in this film are courage (Themistocles), glory (Xerxes), hatred (Artemisia) and vengeance (Queen Gorgo). While I did describe how the film gives a background of Xerxes, you'll also find out more about Artemisia in the movie. If you enjoyed the first 300 or just like action films in general you won't be disappointed with 300: Rise of an Empire.",1401580800,4,2869,4.586744639376218
5607346,5,B00BEJL6JK,"I'm going to write this movie with zero spoilers. So, people can read it without worry about me telling something they may want to see.

I finally saw this movie. I remember watching the original 300 and liked it, but I don't remember much of it. Then, I waited awhile to see this movie and it's great. So now, I got to go back to watch the original 300 and compared that to this. Then, i know which one was better. I have a feeling that this one is better though.

This is a prequel and a sequel to the original 300 movie. It starts just a little bit before the original 300 movie, and then it goes on around the same time as the 300 movie. Then, around the middle of the movie, it catches up and see the end result of the original 300, and by the end of this movie, we'll find out what happen with the war against the Persian empire.

I loved watching this movie. It had tons of action and some tasteful nudity. Great combo when done right. The CGI was great, but I think I remember the CGI from the first movie was better and more of it. There plenty of guys that have the trademark 6 pack abs here. They love showing that on the screen. I love the hot girl with dark eyeshadow. She was the Persian army's general and one of their best fighters. She was a very believable character with great acting skills. On the other side was the Greeks and their general was a great actor as well. He had great fighting skills and looked and sounded like the part. These two people ended up hating and loving each other.

By the end of things, this movie left some room for another movie to be made. I will watch that too if another one does come out. I recommend this movie, if you loved the first 300 movie. If you watch this one, you could skip the first 300 movie, because they did cover the background story in this movie. And, if you do watch the original 300 that will fill you in more with the original plot.",1400976000,,1907,4.145945945945946
5607347,4,B00BEJL6JK,"The cast does have far less big names on it but they still at least give good enough performances to rival the original. Stapleton does a good job as lead but the real star is Eva Green (the main villain of the film), Who commands the screen every time she appears.

The CGI is a bit much and unrealistic at times, Very noticeable in some parts that are a bit too CGI heavy. It still doesn't take away from the action, Which is almost as fun as it was in the original. The plot is solid as well but once again is a bit too generic and lacks the depth and quality side stories that the first film had as well.

Overall though, My family and I (who I saw the film with) were very cautious about seeing it since we saw the first 300 in theaters and absolutely loved it and we are very picky when it comes to the films we watch. Surprisingly though, We all enjoyed it and thought it was a sequel well worthy of the original. It's definitely worth checking out.",1400803200,,956,4.134408602150538
5607348,5,B00BEJL6JK,Really enjoyed the 3D effects in this movie. The Action scenes were outstanding but the story was very predictable. Overall I liked it.,1400630400,,135,4.913043478260869
5607349,3,B00BEJL6JK,"Like most people, when I walked out of the theater in 2007 after seeing 300, I immediately asked, Well, the Spartans were sure amazing, but what were the Athenians doing during all of this?  Who knew that in seven short years, my answer would arrive in the form of 300: Rise of an Empire!

Now, all of you clamoring for a sequel to 300, hold your helmets.  300: Rise of an Empire is more of a companion to its predecessor than a sequel.  The vengeful and honorable Queen Gorgo (Leny Headey) after having lost her king and husband Leonidas in a tragic battle against the massive Persian army at Thermopylae now looks to protect her City-State of Sparta by laying low and fortifying the city.  In preparation, she begins to tell the story of the God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his evolution from child to deity.  The film transitions to spin-off as we are introduced to Thermistocles (Sullivan Stapleton), an Athenian general who in a calculated attack against the Persian army at Marathon succeeded in killing Persian King Darius paving the way for his son Xerxes to take over.  Xerxess ascension to a God-like status, however is thanks to King Dariuss trusted commander of the Persian navy, Artemisia (Eva Green).  Thermistocless plan against Xerxes involves getting all of the city-states in Greece to mobilize and join forces against the Persians, but he is struggling to get any support.

What follows is a warmed over retread of the original 300 plotline, but from an Athenian point of view.  Youll see Thermistocles give impassioned speeches to his out numbered yet capable army.  In fact, in one scene, Thermistocoles explains how Athenian soldiers work as a unit and protect the man to their left.  This is virtually lifted word for word from a similar speech delivered by Leonidas to hunchback, Ephialtes, in the original film.  You will also see many scenes of fast-paced action with sudden slowed down shots of brutality and buckets of 3-D rendered blood spatter.  What you won't see is anything reminiscent of the innovative and groundbreaking brilliance of the first film.  The acting is appropriate for its genre, however, and the scene where Thermistocoles meets Artemisia for the first time is compellingly campy, if not borderline pornographic.

The change of scenery from ground war to naval battle is a welcomed change.  The brilliance of ancient sea battles is on full display and does hold your attention.  But it also comes at a loss of some of the greatest stylistic achievements of the original 300.  It is quite clear that most if not all of the sea battle scenes are filmed on a sound-stage.  While the same was true for 300s epic battle scenes, director Zack Snyder was able to play with shadow, perspective, and light to produce a visually stunning look never before seen on film.  300: Rise of an Empire director Noam Murros film is too dark and conventional and at times comes off more as a joke than anywhere near spectacular.  In once scene, Thermistocoles while on board an Athenian ship, suddenly jumps on a horse (thats right a horse!) and rides across several sinking and/or flaming ships while slaughtering every Persian in his path to arrive face to face with Artemisia for the climactic battle.  #PersianAttackOnHorseback!  Never did 300 reach this level of self-indulgence, which is what helped make it so effective.

300: Rise of an Empire is not a complete failure, but it is another entry in a long line of sub-par second installments.  The franchise is certainly open for more installments and perhaps with the right mixture of writing and creativity, the ship can still be righted.  C+

300: Rise of an Empire is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 42 minutes.",1400544000,2,3720,4.834123222748815

We hear viewer complain about violent, too much blood.... sex.... I thought when we walk into a movie like 300, that's what we want to see. Given that said, I personally enjoyed the movie. It delivers what is expected, the movie is nicely designed, scenaries and actions are done in a way like comic....but not quite, has that feel to it, better than Sin City, that is too comic for me. 300 somewhat artistic, and it is the vision of the director. The story flows well, especially I do like the parallel time line with the original 300. So, in my opinion, if you want to watch a movie that is more of a drama, then go to watch a drama.

His ships seem inferior to Xerxes ships, now that will see that Xerxes is is just a Puppet to Eva Greens character .

The other main character is former Bond girl and now embittered ex Greek Persian naval commander Eva Green as Artemis or Artemesia whichever way you want to say it, leading Xerxes navy to finish the Greeks, after Xerxes troops finally kill the 300 and march inland.

As you would expect it's testosterone ramped, highly stylized gory action pretty much from the get go, but ultimately falls pretty flat in my humble opinion.
We have Lena Headey as Butlers widow, now Queen of Sparta with a sour face most of the movie, and the inclusion of a few of the original cast, but that can't save it either.

The Athenians under Themistocles are no Spartans, a loose affiliation of farmers, poets and architects, but they do all however seemed to have had time to spent weeks in the gym honing amazing physiques, and admirable fighting skills.
Outnumbered heavily, the virtually bulletproof Themistocles gives more than a few awesome speeches to rally his troops in the face of insurmountable odds, there's plenty of ""Better to die on your feet, than live on your knees"" inspiration, but he's not the only one getting in on the action. I lost count (and interest) after a while as it seemed everyone got on a soap box and gave a do or die address during the movie.
The special effects I felt were poor, the blood splatter and gore is even more ridiculous than last time, and the Persians are of course treated like canon fodder most of the time.

I could go on, about historical inaccuracy, a ludicrous portrayal of Xerxes and the Persian army in general, or just little things like Artemis being able to back  lip Xerxes without being strung up like a prize turkey, the list would be pretty long!

If you want something to try and make more sense of the original movie, or give you a flavor of what else was happening at the time, the voice over narrative does a pretty good job.
Unfortunately, one really has to put their brain in neutral to sit through this without laughing too much. 2 stars",1397001600,3,3113,5.082191780821918
5607357,5,B00BEJL6JK,"I loved this movie! I'm not sure why this particular movie is continually receiving bad ratings wherever I find them on the internet, but here's the deal, this is an action film from Hollywood, which in itself should say a few things; first not going to be completely historically accurate, second probably going to have violence and sex, third the sequel is never better then the first and last the plot is not going to make complete sense because its hard to properly explain and give some deep philosophical reason for why some guy is getting his head cut off. Now if you can make peace with these points (as they seem to be the biggest complaints of the movie) then this movie was fun to watch visually and the acting was pretty good considering the actors had to spend 90% of their set time saying their lines to a green screen( also Gerard Butler's steps are not easily followed). I for one enjoy the 300 series, there is an originality about the comic book style visuals and I prefer slow motion action as opposed to action sequences that move so fast you cannot understand what is happening. As far as movie storylines from this time era, for me the 300 series and Troy have portrayed them in very different but equally superior to all others that have been produced. If you enjoyed 300 then you will enjoy this movie.",1396915200,2,1326,4.529166666666667
5607378,1,B00BEJL6JK,"The concept of a prequel/sequel to 300 was interesting.  A couple of the fight choreographies seemed amazing.  But the story was hugely lacking and unbelievable.  Characters were unconvincing.  Lena Headey's character was the best and her part was small.  The filmmakers tried to go to the extreme with throwing in gratuitous blood and boobs.  The animalistic, sado-masochistic sex scene was inconsistent with the protagonist's character.  I couldn't even watch it - had to turn away until the scene was over.  It just seemed like the filmmakers felt the need to throw in a violent sex-scene in the middle for provocation, but it had nothing to do with the story and it tainted the protagonist's credibility as the hero.  So, this movie was a huge disappointment to follow ""300.""  The concept idea had great potential; the fight choreography had great potential.  But in the end, a well-crafted good story and well-developed characters were sacrificed with over-the-top sex and violence.

5607380,2,B00BEJL6JK,"It's become clear that popular movie franchises have a morbid immortality -- you simply can't kill them off, even when every character in the movie dies. This is why ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" -- which concluded with the entire planet being nuked -- was followed by ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes."" So perhaps it's no surprise that ""300,"" a movie based on a comic book based on the real life Battle of Thermopylae, spawned a sequel. SPOILER ALERT: 299 of the 300 didn't make it. But a little fact like that wasn't going to stop director Noam Murro from making ""300: Rise of an Empire"" based off Frank Miller's unpublished graphic novel Xerxes, which was inspired by the real life Battle of Salamis.

The first problem is that there is no Gerard Butler. The sight of digitally-added abs is no longer quite as thrilling when it first debuted in ""300,"" but leading man Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) does his best surrounded by his fellow Athenians. The primary difference between the Athenians and their bloodthirsty Spartan brethren from the first film is that they talk a lot more. Themistocles is single-handedly responsible for killing King Darius I of Persia (Igal Naor) with a well-placed arrow at the Battle of Marathon. Puppet master Artemisia (Eva Green, a whirlwind of blades and bosom) encourages Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to seek godhood and wage war on the Athenians, due in no small part to her own thirst for vengeance at having her family slaughtered by them. So in short, the slaughter of the first film is pretty much all Themistocles fault.

The first few minutes of ""Rise of an Empire"" provides a satisfying explanation as to the freaky weirdness of the Persian army from the first film. Yes, Xerxes really is a supernatural giant; yes, he really does have cat-like monsters and giants in his employ; and yes, this is all pretty biased against Persians but when you loosely base a movie off of historical events, someone ends up being demonized. Unfortunately, some of this narrative is robbed of its urgency because we're to believe second-in-command Artemisia is behind it all. So yeah, ""300"" is also all Artemisia's fault.

What ensues are a series of naval battles that are essentially land battles with boats. Instead of firing arrows at each other, the Greeks close to melee combat by ramming. Instead of just waiting until the Persians close and stay safely on the shore, the Greeks engage them in the water with a much smaller force. And instead of using brilliant tactics to engage the enemy, the Athenians use a CliffsNotes version of history: fog, land-locked territory, and a bunch of other feints come from seemingly nowhere. This is all supposed to be Themistocles' doing, but it's hard to believe him; his abs speak louder than his words.

All throughout, Themistocles keeps trying to get the Spartans back into the fight by having long, stilted conversations with Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey). This has the added unwelcome effect of Gorgo narrating different parts of the film with grave dialogue that seems like an Ancient Greek word association exercise.

There's a subplot with Athenian fathers and sons that lacks any gravity due to the actors involved; a girl power sex scene in which Artemisia attempts to forcibly seduce a bewildered Themistocles; and not enough Xerxes. Seriously, when you have a gold-skinned giant leading your army, a hellcat warrior in designer outfits pales in comparison.

The ""300"" franchise's primary claim to fame is its blood and gore, but the special effects are subpar here too. Characters don't so much explode with blood as they eject it from random places on their armor -- it looks like painted-on special effects. Because the film lacks much in the way of 3D-ness to justify the price tag, there is always stuff floating in the air -- ashes, blood, dust -- anything to enhance the 3D experience that isn't there.

If ""Rise of an Empire"" was its own film, it would be merely be a platform to let a bare-chested Eva Green gloriously tear up the scenery. But as a sequel to a superior first installment, it's a soggy mess.",1395705600,7,4116,4.854700854700854
5607381,1,B00BEJL6JK,"I'm a Persian, I watched the movie last night and I think it was really unjust to our history, and it's not making it OK by simply saying that it was made upon a comic book, there are many points which I couldn't close my eyes on and this is why I'm writing this. if you don't care about the accuracy of historical events you will probably enjoy the movie and in that case you don't need to read this review just move on to the next. But if you are aware of the conflicts between the east and west, the history of Greko- Persian wars and relationships etc you will suffer thorough the movie and here is why: 1- The history is twisted in the movie and very one sided 2- The movie makers present Persians as terrorists since they use suicide bombers to win the battle which is a shame, how could they relate something that accrued just in the recent history to a great nation like Persia!. 3- The Persian king Xerxes, is presented as a cowered, Darius, father of Xerxes was killed by Themistokles, a Greek general, and before his last breathes he tells Xerxes that ""do not repeat my mistake, only gods can defeat Greeks""! while Darius never left Persia to attend this war and he was not killed by Themistokles and until this day, Iranians are visiting his tomb and paying him respect. 4- The customs for Iranian soldiers and the king himself are simply Arabic customs, the general who trained Artemisia is a black person, with my respect to Arabs and every other racial group, I'm I the only one who notices this movie and feels deeply sorry for the racist movie makers?! Is it hard to tell Persians and Arabs and Blacks apart? It's just sick man who are these wild, not civilized people with long beards in this movie? With a simple look at the statues of Persepolis you can find out how Persians looked like. 6- Muhammad Dandamayev a Russian historian, mentions in his famous book ""A political history of the Achaemenid empire""; that after the Spartans killed the Persians messengers they realized what a big mistake they did and sent two soldiers to Persia so they can be killed instead of the Persian messengers and Xerxes tells them ""I would be like a nation that violated the internationally known values and performed a disrespecting act of cowardliness"" apparently this scene was shown as a remarkable thing to do in the movie 7- Last and most important point is in the movie, the Persians did not care about the slaves and the soldiers who were killed but the Greeks were defending not only their country but the freedom and democracy and apparently they don't have any slaves working for them, while slavery was widely spread at that time and it wasn't like the recent slavery of African people, the color did not matter and the Greeks were using them to build their citadels like Acropolis, surprisingly the Persians were paying workers to build Persepolis! the reason I remember this one in particular is that it was discovered just recently, archaeologists found some payment receipts made of rocks if I'm not mistaken belonged to workers who participated in building Persepolis from different nations. Democracy does not have the same meaning as the democracy we know nowadays, it's funny how this movie reflects the American perspective toward Middle-east.",1395532800,12,3269,4.677083333333333
5607382,3,B00BEJL6JK,"300:  Rise of an Empire is the second movie of the 300 franchise.  It is not a sequel or prequel.  It is a story which runs side by side with the first one.  Though it has its moments, the film is not as good as the first one.

The first 10 minutes is basically about how Themistokles, an Athenian general, became a legend by slaying the Persian emperor, Darius, in battle.  He realizes the mistake he made was not killing his son Xerses in that same battle.  Xerses, filled with vengeance, realizes he must become a God in order to subjugate the Greeks.  He makes a deal with dark powers to convert him from a regular white guy to a freakish looking Latino with piercings.  Thus he becomes the God King of Persia and is now ready to battle the Greeks.  To accomplish this, Xerses appoints Artemisia, one of his father's most trusted commanders, to lead a naval campaign to destroy his Greek nemesis.

The last sentence of that paragraph is, I think, the primary reason the film is not as good as it could have been.  Instead of getting the story of Themistokles vs Xerses, you get Themistokles vs Artemisia.  I wanted to see the former, which is a much more interesting storyline in my opinion.

Artemisia, played by Eva Green, looks drop dead gorgeous in this film.  Artemisia is a Greek woman who was rescued by the Persians after the Greeks killed her family.  She obviously hates the Greeks for this, so it makes no sense that Themistokles and her have an out of nowhere sex scene in the middle of the film.  It seemed very forced.

That, and other moments in the film, show how an inadequate script can ruin a film.  This film could have easily gotten five stars.  The script just brings it down.  So, I rate the film three stars out of five.  It still has its moments, just not as many as the first film.",1395532800,5,1811,4.391566265060241

5607384,1,B00BEJL6JK,"It's a shame that these distortions of history are ever taken seriously, and make so much money. In the original make, the Persian king is depicted as a barbaric black man with rings all over his body. That is an insult to African-Americans because the movie makers wanted to depict an evil man. Needless to mention that Persians are of Aryan race.

The history written by Greek historians has not been kind to Persians, but the fact is that back then rivalry amongst dominant nations often ended in battles and the invasion of Persians on Greek soil was no different than the invasion of Alexander resulting in pillaging and burning of Persepolis. Persians were never given the credit for an advanced civilization which they were (i.e., first to mint coins or establish a courier system). What stands out is that Persians never believed in slavery, a claim no other ancient nation can make. In fact, it is well documented in Jewish history than when Cyrus, the Persian king, conquered Babylon he gave enslaved Jews the option to either stay as free men or go back to their homeland.",1395446400,8,1083,4.76063829787234
5607385,3,B00BEJL6JK,"Out of all movies, ""300"" doesn't seem like it could have a sequel. After all -- spoiler alert -- the movie ends with almost everybody dying.

So with ""300: Rise of an Empire,"" they had to make a movie which is 90% side-story (stuff going on at the same time as ""300"") and only 10% sequel (stuff going on after ""300""). It's not a bad movie, but it lacks the bombastic testosterone over-the-topness of the original film, especially from the lead actor Sullivan Stapleton. It feels less like a true sequel, and more like somebody's fanfic.

The story is recounted in flashback by Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), who describes how the Athenian general Themistocles (Stapleton) killed King Darius I of Persia during a battle. The devious naval general Artemisia (Eva Green) convinces his grieving son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to become a god-king... and it's not really explained what this gives him, aside from baldness and lots of chains.

As Xerxes' forces approach by land and sea, Themistocles appeals unsuccessfully to Gorgo for help -- he knows that only a united Greece can defeat the Persians. He's particularly worried about Artemisia, who was born Greek but defected to the Persians after Greek hoplites killed her family, raped and enslaved her. You can see why she's angry. Now she is the commander of Xerxes' navy, and her ships vastly outnumber the Athenians'.

But Themistocles' cunning allows them to drive back the Persians, and Artemisia reveals that she has both a professional and personal interest in him -- but his attraction to her can't compete with his loyalty to Greece. As the brave 300 are destroyed and the Athenian navy crippled, Themistocles faces a defeat more terrible than death.

Like I said, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" feels kind of like someone wanted to write a fanfic around the original story, ""Hey, you know what would be cool? If there was ANOTHER battle going on, except they were from Athens! And instead of Xerxes leading the navy, there will be this cool warrior lady, and she and Themistocles are hot for each other but they're enemies..."" And so on, and so forth -- a different story, which periodically dips back into Spartan affairs to remind us, ""Hey, this is going on too! Because the movies are connected!""

The biggest problem is that director Noam Murro just... isn't making it as exciting. It just lacks the over-the-top, testosterone-soaked bombast that made ""300"" so good -- you don't get the feeling of ravenous passion from Stapleton and the Athenians. Stapleton's performance is just too subtle and subdued, compared to the roaring hyperenthusiasm that Gerard Butler brought to Leonidas (which also made him a meme).

Granted, Stapleton is not bad -- he gives a pretty decent performance as Themistocles, a noble leader who has trouble getting people to follow him. Eva Green gives a deliciously scenery-chewing scene as a vengeance-hungry leader, who has a love-hate relationship with Themistocles -- when they aren't having room-smashing negotiation sex, they are trying to impale each other on big phallic swords.

Sadly not a lot of the Athenians are memorable except a kid trying to prove that he's a man; the best supporting roles are people from ""300,"" particularly Lena Headey and stock footage of Gerard Butler. Keep an eye out for David Wenham!

But taken on its own merits, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is a decent movie, smushing together comic-book fantasy with bronzed-light and slow-motion. The battles between the Persian and Athenian navies are pretty spectacular, filled with fire, arrows and explosions, and culminating in a pretty nasty swordfight. But while it's interesting to see Xerxes' backstory, the first third of the movie is too heavy with exposition and flashbacks.

""300: Rise of an Empire"" might have been more enjoyable if it had not been a sidequel to the prototypical Greco-action movie. However, Eva Green and the action scenes make it worth watching.",1395273600,,3933,4.990839694656488
5607386,3,B00BEJL6JK,"I am a big fan of the movie 300 with Gerard Butler. So naturally when I heard there was to be a sequel, I was curious to see how it would turn out. Much to my disappointment last year, the movie which, was originally scheduled to be released in August of last year was irrevocably moved up to March of this year. So finally after my latest viewing, all the while anticipating Captain America the Winter Soldier, here are my thoughts on 300 Rise of an Empire.

So In 300 Rise of an Empire, set after the brutal events of the previous film, we hear Queen Gorgo begin a grand story in which our soon to be main protagonist Themistocles, is famed for the assassination of King Darius. Little does Themistocles realize is that soon, he will be forced to deal with another baddy Artemisia, and thus 300 Rise of an Empire begins.

There are good things and bad things in this movie. Lena Headey did a fine job narrating throughout the movie. I feel that it gave the movie an almost poetic type feel to the film itself. Another good thing is as with the last 300, this one has no shortage of action sequences. And finally, Eva Green starring as Artemisia. She does a stellar job with the character, and she definitely can handle a sword. I appreciated the depth and aura in her character. Now lets talk about the not so good things.

Sullivan Stapleton's character Themistocles was also quite interesting. I feel his performance was alright, but he just doesn't have the same resonance as Gerard Butler's Leonidas. And too there are times where I felt his acting felt kind of forced but it was pretty easy to overlook. Another thing that bothered me(but only a little) is the script. The first act and third act were really good, but nothing in the second act really caught my attention as much. But despite those minor nitpicks, the movie is still one I would consider fair.

Overall, while Rise of an Empire is not as good as the first, the movie has good things to offer. And as for my final rating for the movie well, here it is:

3 Stars

5607387,4,B00BEJL6JK,"300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE, knew right from the start exactly what it wanted to accomplish, and did so with a minimum of substance and a maximum of style. Now, for some viewers, this will be completely satisfying...and other viewers may find the film lacking in key areas. It's time to find where you lie.

If you like: hyper-stylized, slo-motion violence, flying bodies, spewing blood, epic music, giant battles, buff actors, sexy actresses, shouted speeches, stylized cinematography, battle scenes of dubious historicity, Eva Green chewing the scenery, earnest performances from a ripped cast, dastardly villains, blood, sweat, and rain, heavy R-ratings, and relatively simple-minded, stylish and macho war movies...
Then congrats, 300: Rise of an Empire is for you!

But if you like: historical accuracy, a strong plot, subtle acting, practical effects, morals, and an accurate depiction of ancient combat...I suggest you pick up Gladiator or read Herodotus. Rise of an Empire isn't the type of film for you.

If you saw Zack Snyder's visceral, testosterone-packed 300, then you know much of what you're getting in it's sequel. Now, Rise of an Empire isn't as good a film as 300, and I think we know why that is: the story of 300 Spartans fighting to the last man against terrible odds... is a much stronger story than a leader building a bunch of ships to go fight other ships. Secondly, Sullivan Stapleton, while suitably buff and a capable actor, just doesn't have the gravitas of Gerard Butler.

Thankfully, our returning cast - the amazing David Wenham, the strong-willed Lena Headey, and the insanely over-the-top Rodrigo Santoro as the eight foot god-king Xerxes - all give surprisingly good performances. Sullivan Stapleton holds his own, and his deep voice is the voice of a born leader. But it is Eva Green - scary, subtle, ruthless Eva Green that steals the scenes as Artemisia, the Persian commander of thousands of ships.

You know much of the rest: flying buckets of blood, sloooooow thenreallyfastmotion! gravity-defying leaps, flying arrows, swinging swords, sweaty six-packs, a drained color palate, flowing robes, and stylized gore. Zack Snyder pioneered it all in 300, and his style is borrowed for better and for worse by director Noam Murro. As I said before, know where you lie with this sort of film, and it will fulfill all it sets out to do!

My rating? 3.5 blood-drenched stars, rounded up to 4!

5607388,4,B00BEJL6JK,"There is nothing like epic historical fantasy to piss-off the Iranians once again. This story starts at Marathon where Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) kills King Darius (Igal Naor) wearing a costume stolen from Emperor Ming. Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) goes on to become a ""god-king"" and getting a minor role, while looking like the incarnate of evil. Persia has Artemis I of Caria (a pale Eva Green) lead the navy against Greece where Themistocles is attempting to unite the Greek city states to defeat the invading Persians. Sparta wants to go its own way. The 300 Spartans we get to see laying on the ground dead, post battle as Xerxes proclaims victory and moves on to Athens. I guess that was my bad expecting to see the 300 do battle and that whole thing about the goat path because someone put ""300"" in the title of the film.

This is the adult fantasy version of the story. There was plenty of slow motion blood splatter. They like the blood to land on the camera lens (or glass) and look suspended in the air for a while. The speeches given in the film were necessary for the production, but were completely boring. ""Freedom is her wisdom has chosen you to defend her.""

There is also both male and female narration because not everyone knows butchered Greek History. This film takes liberties with the accounts of Plutarch, Herodotus, and Polyaenus. For instance, Artemis I of Caria was actually Queen of Halicarnassus and only commanded five ships. Her character is greatly multiplied in this film.

Good popcorn film for adults. Nothing more.

5607389,3,B00BEJL6JK,"""300"" burst onto the scene with a look and feel never before seen by movie audiences. It were as though the producers wanted to see how they could outdo themselves with this new version. They figured it out but, sometimes less is more.

Here's the scoop. As other have noted, this outing depicts events leading up to, and coincident with, the original. But here the focus is on Themistocles as he attempts to lead the Greeks as they try to ward off the invasion by Xerxes and his hordes, lead by Artemisia and her vast fleet of ships. It's an out and out bloodfest.

On the good side is the scope. This is a far larger movie than the original. As striking as were the visuals in ""300"" there was a sense of claustrophobia in it. Even the large battle scenes were held in a tight frame. Here the viewer gets a much larger canvas. But it's all so extreme. It's like reading a book that's printed in all upper case. In the original, scenes with huge visual impact were interlaced with quieter scenes, helping to allow the audience to catch its collective breath. Here, nearly everything is underlined. You've never seen so much splattering blood and cleaved body parts as you'll see here. It exhausted me.

Eva Green, as Artemisia, could have been great. She has eyes that I could stare at for hours. (And the make-up artists got a lot of mileage out of them) But, like the rest of the film, everything about her was too pronounced. Sullivan Stapleton, as Themistocles didn't have strong enough a presence for me. Gerard Butler is a tough act to follow and Stapleton's voice just wasn't strong enough. They also tried to capitalize on some of what made the original so engaging. The father and son fighting side by side. The few against the many. But it didn't have the impact of the original.

The visuals ARE stunning, and I could only guess at how many of them were even accomplished, but at the end I felt as though I were the one who was pummeled for the 102 minute running time. This is not a bad watch, but it might have you scurrying to witness the glory of the original.",1394928000,,2075,4.4526315789473685
5607390,4,B00BEJL6JK,"That also butchers history, so if your expecting a documentary then you should look elsewhere. So Rise of an Empire is the sequel to the 2007 movie 300; a movie filled to the brim with slow-mo, CGI blood effects, and not so subtle xenophobia. All of which pretty much make a return in this movie. Taking place before and after the events of the first movie, this time it focuses mainly around Athenian soldier/politician Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) who attempts to unite all of the Greek city states into a coalition to fight off the inevitable Persian invasion. We also see a return from some characters from the last movie like Xerxes, which to my disappointment really didn't center around as much as the trailer made it seem. Instead from the Persian side we see Artemisia who is portrayed quite intensely by Eva Green.

There are a few other new characters but none of them had a screen presence as strong as Stapleton or Green for that matter who fills the role of classic villain almost perfectly. While writing wise they definitely tried to portray Themistocles as more diplomatic than Leonidas in 300 he still comes across as a bit of a clone. He gives loud cheese filled speeches to his men and is ridiculously unstoppable in combat. However unlike Leonidas, we really don't see a origin with Themistocles instead the movie simply throws out that he's the greatest Athenian warrior ever and leaves it at that. In the end I really liked Artemisia because her story was interesting and she was just so ""evil"". While Xerxes comes across as a bit of a wuss Artemisia is actually very deadly as a warrior and she just oozes hated.

The movie of course wouldn't carry the name 300 unless it had just as much blood and violence as the first. However instead of land battles we are treated to some very over the top naval battles between the Greeks and the Persians. The effects are pretty well done. Add in a booming soundtrack and you've got some beautiful battle scenes. Gallons of blood spew out of chopped limbs. Slow motion is used liberally as Greek ships crash into Persian ships reducing them to driftwood. Persian soldiers of course have a life expectancy of about ten seconds which is pretty hilarious given that the movie constantly drives home the point that the Athenians are ""just farmers"". Despite all the Athenians being chiseled white dudes. Still the portrayal of the Persians is a lot more balanced than the first movie. Though the Persians are made so cartoonishly evil I took them about as serious as the Galactic Empire in Star Wars. Where as the Greeks are the golden boys who throw the words ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" around every five minutes.

In the end the movie was just very fun in a Conan: The Barbarian kind of way. Plenty of violence, battle, cheesy dialogue and an almost funny if it wasn't so awkward sex scene. The strongest points of it were the naval battles which are done on an visually epic scale. There is also Eva Green who just stole the show completely. If you liked the first then there is a good chance you'd also like this one. If you want a spectacle of battle and gore then this movie is a good fix. It isn't going to win any awards but that's just fine it's a fun movie and it's worth a watch.",1394841600,2,3253,4.605172413793103
5607391,2,B00BEJL6JK,"As it became a surprise global mega-hit, 300 must have given at least one studio executive a headache:  can a film in which almost every principal character is dead by the final frame still result in an ongoing franchise?  (Similar questions arose regarding Gladiator and The Departed, among others.)  Anyone with at least a modest knowledge of Herodotus' history, however, knows the deaths of Leonidas and his Spartans is part of a grander story.  So, several years later, we have 300: Rise of an Empire, an ultra-violent, high-style depiction of the sea warfare which pit the heroes of Greece against a much larger Persian fleet.

On the surface, this is not an awful film:  in regard to both aesthetic and tone, it fits alongside the prior film.  The frame is populated with almost nothing but musclebound male beauties, even though it is said Greece's central force consists, in the nation's desperation, of farmers, townspeople, and unprepared youths.  (This dialogue lands with an extra loud thud when contrasted with the chiseled soldiers on display as it is said.)  Every death is punctuated by a slow-motion geyser of computer-generated blood.  The dialogue, often shouted by the characters, is defined by broad graphic-novel notions of masculinity and nobility.  Yet where I found the original 300 amusing and even hypnotic, 300: Rise of the Empire is dull and exhausting.  Why?  It is hard to say.  Perhaps because so many largely inferior films have utilized the same stylistic tics in the intervening period, rendering the cinematic combat here rote rather than inventive, and perhaps also because the storyline is not as engaging and focused as the 300 Spartans' doomed final stand nor is the Gerard Butler stand-in, studly Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton as Athenian general Themistocles, as overheated and iconic (he cannot brood his way to a moment of wonderful absurdity on par with ""THIS.  IS.  SPARTA!"").

The one element which does elevate Rise of the Empire, if not save it:  Eva Green, who is an electrifying presence as a sexy and volatile version of Persia's sole female naval commander, Artemisia, portrayed here as a slave girl who rises to power under Darius the Great and later Xerxes through betrayal, murder, and general wit.  The gifted and gorgeous Green, who should be a top-of-the-A-list star by now, has received praise even in mixed and negative reviews, and it is not hard to understand why:  she rips into the role and devours it without hesitation, exuding convincing lust and rage at every turn and easily (I repeat, easily) outshining the storyline around her and its other players.  If only she were in every scene; alas, this film does not realize it is a one-woman show.",1394841600,5,2719,5.011135857461024
5607392,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Overtime there have been tons of beloved films get sequels years down the road that just make you cringe (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines to name one) but then there is one like this that lives up to its name, 300. The cast did a remarkable job feeling the shoes of Gerard Butler alone, an actor who sadly hasn't had much of a career since 300 despite displaying a great screen presents.  Now to my review of Rise Of An Empire.

I'm not going to do the obvious which is explain the plot or scenes as that has been done plenty on many websites and thanks to a healthy haul at the box office many already know. Stapleton however did hold his own as the lead but it wasn't until 20-25 minutes into the film you really got a great deal of his performance. Overall solid but at times he seemed bored, and I can only blame that on him as I thought the script was really good for this style/type of film. The real stand out star was the one Eva Green. And please, it was not because of the sex scene, she had plenty of good scenes clothed. She has always been a wonderful actress and she completely owned her role and had the look to pull it off.

The action (stylized and all) was remarkable, however it did have a bit to much slow-motion, I could tell Snyder wasn't directing this film as a director because even he knows the limits of Slow-motion. Again though it was still pretty remarkable. And despite being a blood bath of a movie it isn't going to make you sick by any means unless you just cannot stand the thought of heavy violence as the blood looks very fake, yet real enough to not laugh. I believe all of the blood or most was CGI.

Lastly the story does make sense, mainly because it was written with a sequel in mind. It is based off the graphic novel by Frank Miller ""Xerxes"" he also had input in the first film and probably had his nose in this one as well as it turned out great. If your not  a fan of Frank Miller, you should look up his work and give it a go.

Overall this movie was a surprise for a long awaited sequel and worth the 3D price of admission. 8/10, 4/5 stars.",1394496000,2,2091,4.150617283950617
5607393,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Nine Things about the Movie ""300: Rise of an Empire""

1. This violent action flick isn't really a sequel or a prequel to the movie ""300"". It sort of wraps around it.  It starts out by documenting events before ""300"". Then it tells a parallel story of different battles in a different part of Greece while ""300"" is happening. Then it wraps things up by showing what happens after Sparta's 300 are all killed at the end of the first movie.

2. The main villain of the first film, Xerxes, has a minor role in this one. King Leonidas is not in this movie, except for flashbacks of the first film. This time it's the Athenian hero Themistokles against the female Persian naval commander Artemisia. She's bringing goth back.

3. The movie makes a point to say that the Athenians were mostly farmers, poets, and craftsmen. They were not warriors. But somehow they look and fight just like the Spartans.

4. While the first movie focused on land battles, this one is mostly about ship warfare.

5. It is not directed by the guy that directed the first movie. So while it has a similar feel, it's not quite the same..

6. This movie is an example of what is becoming called ""war porn"" - an athletic ballet of violence and sex appeal. It's absolutely beautiful to watch - even the huge orgasms of blood.

7. I didn't know women used to fight battles in flowy dresses.

8. The sex scene between Themistokles and Artemisia is supposed to be a metaphorical bargaining session about freedom, slavery, and loyalty, but it ends up just being funny.

9. If you want historic accuracy, or metaphors for current world events, or even intelligent discourse about different ways to rule a country, then you need to stay away from this movie. But if you want an absurd piece of kick-ass style and violence, then this might be the best you get all year.",1394496000,178,1830,4.5349544072948325
5607394,3,B00BEJL6JK,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Admittedly I was pleasantly surprised when Zack Snyder came out with the original ""300"" in 2007.  Here he is a producer and turns the directing chores over to Noam Murro, best known for...well nothing.

""Rise of an Empire"" actually takes place in parallel to Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) heroic stand against the ruthless Persian god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro).  Athenian Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton, TV's ""Strike Back"") is trying to unite the various Greek city-states to have a better chance against the Persians who outnumber them 10 to 1.  Lena Headey reprises her supporting role here as Queen Gorgo, Leonidas's bride.

There are some common elements between the two films.  First, the film is shot in the same sepia tone.  That is, there isn't much color other than the bucket o' blood that gush out of fighting soldiers in shades of crimson.  And just so you don't miss it, much of it comes in ultra slow motion.  All the dudes have the same short shorts and washboard stomachs and have great fighting skills, at least most of the time.

So what's different?  First,Themistokles, while he can be a savage in battle, is really a politician at heart.  And he's a great tactician.  Also his battles are fought at sea.  Then of course there is the perfectly cast Eva Green as Artemisia, born Greek but now the senior general/admiral of the Persian forces.  She was instrumental in pushing a reluctant Xerxes into the fray after his father, King Darius (Igal Naor), is killed by Themistokles earlier.

Green is a wonder in the role, chewing up every scenes she is in.  She is a match for any man and really wants Themistokles by her side.  So much so that she calls for a brief truce in order to offer him the job aboard her flagship.  There are other perks as well.  This leads to one of the great sexual confrontations I can ever recall.  You have to see it to believe it.  Back to the differences.  In ""300"" there is a true love connection between Leonidas and Gorgo.  When they make love the night before he goes off to a certain death, you can feel their emotion.  In ""Rise,"" the sex is raw and gnarly to say the least.  This isn't a great movie.  There is a lot of silliness to it all, but it is also a lot of fun.  And then there is Eva Green.",1394323200,,2313,4.570731707317073
5607395,4,B00BEJL6JK,"I have been a fan of Frank Miller's graphic comics for many years and I loved the movie 300 and saw the sequel (300: Rise of an Empire) the morning it came out.  This shows some flash backs of the original battle against the Persians, but this one was focused on the sea battle between the Greeks and Persians.  The special affects are just incredible showing the sea battle and fighting.  I just love a believable female villain and Eva Green fits the bill, even though I think she could use a few more pounds on her thin frame.  Nevertheless, she is a beautiful, sexy and ruthless villain.  She also proves to be a deadly and effective warrior.

Like the original 300, the fights scenes are just fantastic in The Rise of an Empire, showing lots of blood and gore during the battle scenes on the high seas.  Even though I liked the first 300 more than this movie, I would still classify this as a must see film for those who love unique and creative movie making that is full of interesting action.  There is even a love making scene that looks like a battle of wills.

If you loved the first 300, you should check out 300: Rise of an Empire.  One of the ways I judge a movie is whether or not I would enjoy viewing it more than once.  I would most definitely watch this film over and over.

5607396,4,B00BEJL6JK,"Not nearly as memorable as 300 and if it were not for Eva Green, 300: Rise of an Empire would be a 3 star effort at best. She is comes off as both sexy and scary, being that she is an evil warrior woman you don't dare mess with. There is an empty void where Gerard Butler's presence is missed. He has done a bunch of awful movies since 300 I know, but he was pretty good in the role of Leonidas. Overall, it is much of the same in terms of visuals and bloody action.

While far from spectacular, It's not boring in the least and I liked the fact that it is a prequel/companion piece/sequel all rolled into one.",1394236800,,610,4.041322314049586
5607397,5,B00BEJL6JK,"Is this movie like 300 in any way? My opinion is no. Is this movie worth watching?

It depends.

Movie is a little boring at best, with endless fighting scenes and unlimited buckets of blood. What makes this movie worth watching? Artemisia (Eva Green) of course. Without her, this movie would be garbage. She manages to save it in a hurricane of blood lust, vengeance, sweat and desire.

Eva could manage to pull off any given genre, but when it comes to dark and mysterious, crazy as hell characters she's the woman for the role, and here you will most definitely not be disappointed on her. The rest of the movie is crap, it's collateral damage you need to see to be able to witness one of Eva's best performances as of yet. And yes, I am getting this move when it releases ;)",1394150400,,778,4.388888888888889
