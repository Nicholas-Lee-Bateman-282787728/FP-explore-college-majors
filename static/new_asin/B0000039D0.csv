1177564,5,B0000039D0,"A somewhat lengthy story, but filled with all kinds of intrigue, love, and commitment from the main character who has a heart for her passion, which is being a reporter who follows her dream all the way to Nam and back several times.  Very well done.",1412812800,,250,4.434782608695652
1177565,1,B0000039D0,"Information with DVD stated it was for all regions.  However, it does not play on a DVD player in the USA.  I really have been looking for a DVD for this movie and it seems none will play in the USA. I was disappointed when I opened it and tried to play it.",1412208000,,257,3.830188679245283
1177566,5,B0000039D0,I love this movie and I really wish they would get it out on DVD for the USA!!!!!!  I've bought some DVD's that say region 0 (zero) which will work in my DVD player but this one I got was actually region 4 and of course didn't work.  Thankfully I was able to return it.  I really wish they would put all of Danielle Steel's movies out on DVD again in the USA.,1411689600,,359,3.8904109589041096
1177567,1,B0000039D0,"I was very disappointed.  When I received the DVD, I tried it in several different players, and it would not play in any of them. Only after purchasing the DVD was I told (in the package it was mailed in) that it may not play because it was not in ""format for most US players"". I sent it back and was refunded the money I spent but, I would have liked to have been saved the time it took to straighten the whole thing out. This is my very favorite Danielle Steele adaptation, so I was really looking forward to finally owning it.",1410825600,,529,4.135922330097087
1177568,1,B0000039D0,I have read this book over 300 times & have worn out my VHS. I have looked for it on DVD & found that it is not for sale in the U.S.A.

1177583,5,B0000039D0,"Originally enjoyed the book and can now say I enjoyed the movie as well.  I bought the dvd and had to have it replaced.  It still will not play on my multi-region player but I was finally able to watch it on my computer.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The story hits home as the heroine graduated from high school the same year I did and I knew many young men who served in Vietnam.  It was a very moving, bittersweet story.  The men and women who served in Vietnam were treated badly by their fellow countrymen on their return and that is something this country should be ashamed of.
This review still stands.  However, what about offering it on instant video.  I'd add it to my library in a heartbeat.  Watching on the computer is okay but on a big screen tv would be even better.  How about it Amazon?",1388793600,2,824,4.191082802547771
1177584,5,B0000039D0,Seen it years ago and I had to buy it. Really good movie. Glad I found the complete uncut tv mini series.,1387065600,,105,3.8181818181818183
1177585,5,B0000039D0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife.  She loved this film. We had an old VHS version, but wanted a DVD for better quality. This is a region 4 release, not playable on most U. S. DVD players, but we have a multi-region DVD player.  Works great!",1386806400,,241,4.0
1177586,1,B0000039D0,It doesn't work in my DVD playerit's for region 4; and it didn't say that on the choiceI have never been so disappointed with Amazon!!!!!,1386288000,,137,4.52
1177587,5,B0000039D0,"I remember being addicted to all the Danielle Steel movies 20 years ago, so I was so excited when I received the box set of Danielle Steel movies recently.  Message from Nam was one of the first ones I watched because it was always my favourite.  How can anyone not love the journey Paxton Andrews takes over a eleven year period.

It's a long movie, but definitely worth the effort, and because of the length it makes it feel like eleven years do pass, and by the end of the movie I felt like I lived Paxton's life with her.  The actress who plays Paxton is truly remarkable in her role.  At the beginning she is this innocent wide-eyed 18 year old who has so much passion and excitement for the future.  As the years go by, and she faces endless tragedy during the Vietnam War, she becomes tougher and slightly jaded towards life and love.  You almost feel her ageing as the movie goes on, even though I guess her age to be about 30 by the time the movie ends.

I don't want to give too much away for the people who haven't seen this movie, but be warned, this movies shows the harsh realities of war, and what the people of Vietnam went through, as well as the soldiers who went over there to fight.  I found all the characters to be engaging, and wanted them all to find happiness.  My favourite character was Tony.  He was so cold and distant at the beginning, but as his feelings for Paxton grew, he became this beautiful, passionate caring man.  I loved his first encounter with Paxton when he said to her, ""Are we recruiting high school girls to fight the war now?""  And later in the movie when Paxton told him men fighting a war shouldn't have their heads filled with other things because it could get them killed, to which Tony replied he hoped she was wrong because his head had been filled up with thoughts of her for eight months.  Sigh.  Who couldn't love a man who speaks like that.

Through out this movie you will find yourself crying, smiling and caring about these people as they all strive to find happiness during such a terrible time in history.  This movie teaches you to not give up on love, no matter how many times your heart breaks, because life is worth living if you have someone travelling along the same road as you.  In other words, watch this movie.  It's a sweeping epic that will stay with you long after you watch it :-)",1378944000,,2356,4.337899543378995
1177588,5,B0000039D0,help please i loved the movie when it was on television and now where can  i find a usa version of message from nam all i find is the non usa ones you cant play here please i would love to have a usa version to watch thanks,1377129600,,223,3.6458333333333335
1177589,1,B0000039D0,"I had to return this movie because it was a ""Region"" that I didn't realize I could not play.  I would very much like to had a DVD that I would be able to play.  I wanted to add it to my Danielle Steel collection.",1359763200,,212,3.688888888888889
1177590,5,B0000039D0,it just sucks that i could not find it compatible with dvd playrrs from the United States. i had to order a region free dvd player. I love the movie tho. i plan on buying another copy.,1354406400,,184,4.0
1177591,1,B0000039D0,This movie does not work.  I am not able to watch the movie.  It would have been nice to have been able to have a product I could use. =(,1350864000,,137,3.533333333333333
1177592,5,B0000039D0,I love this movie!  I watched it a LONG time ago when it first aired on TV as a mini-series.  I was lucky to tape it to VHS at the time and have watched the tape so many times since...almost wearing it out.  Ever since I have anxiously awaited for the DVD to be released NOT in Region 2 format.  The past 5 years I've kept a watchful eye and I'm now assuming they will never make a version that will play in the US.  This severely disappoints me as it is by far one of my favorite movies ever!,1291852800,,493,3.89
1177593,5,B0000039D0,"This is possibly one of my favorite books by Danielle Steel, Palamino is my other one.  When they made the movie for Message from Nam for TV I watched it and itwas great, at the time I taped it, thru the years the tape got lost or taped over, so I was thrilled when I could get it, I will be transfering it to a DVD asap. The movie means a lot to me because it was in my era and hit close to home.",1284681600,,397,3.6705882352941175
1177594,4,B0000039D0,"The book was great, the movie was good. As usual the movies are never as good as the book, but I have watched the movie many times. Ted Marcoux was a perfect choice for Tony Campobello. I  purchased the VCR a few years ago on Amazon and have been awaiting its release in DVD. I am sorry to see the message that the manufacturer is no longer producing this movie on DVD. I would like to ask that the movie be re-released in DVD for customers out there who are Danielle Steel readers who like the movies.  This is one of the best, its a shame it is no longer available.",1239580800,,567,4.099099099099099
1177595,5,B0000039D0,"I saw the movie on TV,  I ordered it for my collection.  I think it was in June.  I have never recieved it.  I'm still waiting.  I loved it. it is one of MS. Steels best made for tv movies.",1191888000,3,189,3.625
1177596,1,B0000039D0,I am sorry I can't do a review.  I never got Message from Nam.  I am still waiting and have been since June 2006. I filled in one star because it's a required field.  Jo Ann Mackey,1168300800,2,180,3.810810810810811
1177597,5,B0000039D0,This is one of the best movies I ever seen. Everybody should get it.,1112745600,3,68,3.9285714285714284
1177598,5,B0000039D0,"This was an adventurous love story with twists and turns.  I was eager to see what was happening next.  Great story line.  It has ""re-watch ability"". Great romance for a ""chick flick"" and enough action for men to enjoy as well.  Watch it!",1110844800,10,238,4.465116279069767
1177599,5,B0000039D0,"If you enjoy really, really bad cinema, then you have GOT to check out Message from Nam.  I am telling you, this movie is hilarious.  I'm not sure if all Danielle Steel stories are this utterly ridiculous, but if so, I AM HOOKED.
For starters, the entire thing has that soft glow that all Hallmark movies have.  It's like watching people through a Vaseline filter.
Second, the film features Rue McClanahan (Blanche from The Golden Girls) and Lando himself, Billy Dee Williams.  Finally bringing together these two talents in one film, as I am sure you know, makes for some dynamic cinema.
Finally, putting the trashy romance of Danielle Steel up against the backdrop of Vietnam makes for some of the most inappopriate and simultaneously hilarious moments that I can ever recall.
So do yourself a favor--go out and buy Danielle Steel's Message From Nam.  I promise you, it is funnier than anything in your current collection.
P.S.  To the distributors of this movie--we DEMAND a director's cut with commentary.  A film of this magnitude makes it a must.",1076889600,4,1052,4.843575418994414
1177600,4,B0000039D0,"This is a wonderful saga in the tradition of North and South.  It's got just the right amount of drama and sentimentality, and just the right amount of cheeziness.  After I watched it, I went right out and bought a Danielle Steel book!",1076803200,4,235,4.441860465116279
1177601,5,B0000039D0,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time.  I read the Danielle Steele's book, as always (she's my favorite), but the movie is something I think I could watch every day.  I love it.  Even though I was only about 8 or 10 when my brother was in Nam for 2 terms, I always respected him.  He enlisted, not drafted.  I can honestly say that I even respect him more after watching this movie, and its not even based on a true story.  I have to buy this video!!",1041984000,3,456,4.011111111111111
