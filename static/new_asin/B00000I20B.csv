As for the animation, it's expressive and free-flowing and intentionally disjointed, some great imagery based on ""naive"" arts, but not really my cup-of-tea. It's a mash-up of various Faith Hubley animations loosely strung together on the theme of our evolution as a species and as individuals - from a cosmic perpective. Wide, man, real wide.",1235001600,,544,4.7368421052631575
7909393,5,B00000I20B,"Excellent collection.

This early DVD is chock full of animation, back when they actually tried to fill 'em up with bonuses and such.

You won't see  it in one sitting, that's for sure.",1200960000,,185,4.545454545454546
7909394,5,B00000I20B,"A quick primer for those unfamiliar with Faith and John Hubley: In the early 1950s, John Hubley was prospering animator with the upstart UPA studio (a creative group that essentially redefined animation and character design, breaking from the flowing realist look of Disney and allowing for sharper angles and greater stylization).  Yet, at the height of his achievements, Hubley was singled out by the House Committee on Un-American Activities as a Communist.  Although Hubley himself adamantly denied the charges, he refused to point the finger to someone else, and so was ousted from the studio and blacklisted.

This is actually the beginnings of a wonderful story, and from this point in his career, Hubley began to work with his wife Faith to create independent animations that spoke from, and to, the heart.  Several of these films became Academy Award nominees, and Academy Award winners as well.

Which brings us to this DVD, a fairly comprehensive anthology of the Hubley's work, including the feature film ""The Cosmic Eye,"" as well as several influential short films: ""The Hole,"" ""The Adventures of *,"" ""Of Men and Demons"" and ""Voyage to Next,"" among others.  Though the picture and sound quality is not as good as one might hope for, it is an absolute pleasure to see these films in their entirety.

If you haven't encountered the Hubley's work, I think this DVD is a marvelous place to start.  You will be thrilled by the Hubley's ability to coax character and life out of recorded voices, jazz beats and simple forms.  There is a mode of expression here that you will not find anywhere else, and a depth of purpose that is unparalleled in contemporary animation.  These films are works of art, and as such, they deserve to be seen and treasured.  What's more, they are not only suitable for children, they are longing to connect with young minds and to encourage growth and thought.

I can't speak highly enough of the work of the Hubleys.  Yes, ""The Cosmic Eye,"" is a little expensive, but with 245 minutes of magic included, I think you'll find this purchase to be well worth the price.  Enjoy!",1107043200,4,2110,4.841225626740947
