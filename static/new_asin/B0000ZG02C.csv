8004853,5,B0000ZG02C,"Dragon Ball - Fortuneteller Baba Saga continues the adventures of Goku, searching for the seventh Dragon Ball.
It marks the first time that I'm seeing the episodes uncut.  Even used, it was hard to find and lucked out with Amazon.com.
The action, comedy and weirdness is all here... specifically fans of the series would enjoy it.",1360281600,,330,4.892857142857143
8004854,5,B0000ZG02C,"Came VERY fast! thank you! It feels good to watch Dragon ball again, It may not have the super action that Dragon Ball Z has, but it is still very interesting and suspenseful, about the same amount as Z in that regard.
i only had to pay around 6 bucks for mine, and for 16 episides, that's a real steal!",1350777600,,303,4.066666666666666

8004856,5,B0000ZG02C,"After defeating the Red Ribbon Army, Goku learns finding the final Dragon Ball won't be as easy as he thought.  For some reason, it can't be seen on the Dragon Radar.  As Goku wonders how he can find the final Dragon Ball, Master Roshi knows of a way, but it won't be easy.  Goku and his friends search out Fortune Teller Baba who can find anything with her powers.  Goku and friends find that she charges $10 million zeni for her services. (Zeni is money in the DB world)  However, if Goku and the gang can defeat Baba's five warrior's she will show them the way to the final Dragon Ball.

Baba's warriors are very unique and each have funny and exciting battles.  Goku is sure in his abilities until he faces off with Baba's last warrior, a man in a Bunny Mask!  How does this man know all of Goku's moves and weaknesses and why does he smell nice to Goku?  The secret is revealed, as well as the location of the last Dragon Ball, in the 16 episode Fortune Teller Baba Saga!

I like the battles in this saga as well as the touching moments when you remember Goku is still just a kid at heart. (Buy the episodes and you'll see what I mean.)  I recommend this volume only to older fans of DB and DBZ  because it contains quite a bit of nudity, more than any other saga. (Goku and Bulma come to mind) Still, this is a good saga with comedy and action and it's tough to beat a great deal like 16 episodes on just 2 disks.",1152489600,2,1419,4.157509157509158
8004857,5,B0000ZG02C,"I am writing this review for this set as it was quite fun using the audio/subtitle options on this dvd set. First, I found that the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue are almost completely different from the english audio/subtitle. SO you can watch it in English Audio & have the japanese subtitle[option 2] and watch the differences in meaning & intent.

Another way is to watch the Japanese Dialogue but w/ the english subtitle[option 1] & you will notice how WILD the english audio was, especially in the baba saga.

Personally I enjoy the Japanese audio w/ japanese translated subtitle for 99% of Japanese anime as they convey the original intent of the creator's work. But funimation had changed the INTENT for the ENGLISH audio & it is quite funny in a camp/kitsch way.

And the fortuneteller baba saga had a lot of out-of-the-way dialogue vs Japanese subtitle, which is not the case for Commander Red saga where the differences between the english & translated subtitles are not that great.

I put the enjoyment level for Baba saga English dialogue in terms of wit, camp & kitsch as the first 13 episodes of Dragonball. And I would put it to you that the differences in the english & translated subtitle makes this & other dragonball dvds worth it vs HK subtitles. In addition, these differences makes you wonder whether you are getting an accurate translations, especially the RANMA 1/2 dvds which only have 1 set of english subtitles which match the english dialogue.",1150243200,,1477,4.826086956521739
8004858,5,B0000ZG02C,"When Goku loses the location to the final dragon ball, he and the rest of the gang are forced to visit the Turtle Hermit's psychic sister to help find it. Of course there is a price, and Toriyama (the author) delivers with an over the top tournament involving the Invisible man, Dracula, the mummy, and the Devil, who fights in a giant toilet (you'll have to see it to understand)! The grand finale is one of the top 5 fights in Dragonball history. Definitely recommended, one scene even shows Bulma's breasts. Cartoon boobs are cool!
