I was impressed with Elizabeth Berkley, she did a very good job--kind of saved this movie for me. It is one of those stories where they put a character in a tough spot--she lived up to what she was supposed to do. I will look for more movies with her as the lead--you can't go wrong with a strong actress like Elizabeth Berkley.",1400284800,,471,4.130434782608695

7912162,4,B00000JGJW,"With some poor dialogue scripting and weak directing of the actors in the first 15 minutes I wasn't impressed.  Then it smoothed out and turned into a well written, acted and directed suspence thriller.  It's not a major studio release, but there are enough twists and turns to keep interest high.

The ending was yet another twist, though I have to admit I think that specific ending could have been touched up a little more.  But, leaving it dangling wasn't a bad move, on second thought.

Overall, I was entertained.",1428278400,,519,4.722222222222222

7912166,4,B00000JGJW,"The plot of this movie is very interesting, and Elizabeth Berkley does a great job acting the part of a woman accidentally caught up in a cat-and-mouse game of murder and leaves us wondering until the end to know how the story all ties together. I liked the movie a lot.",1402963200,,270,4.313725490196078
