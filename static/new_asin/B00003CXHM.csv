1265109,5,B00003CXHM,"Filth and the Fury is a great documentary from director Julian Temple on the Sex Pistol's. Film shows how the Pistol's became England's public enemy#1 in 1976 and 1977 by shaking up the status quo. They went against the grain and took no prisoners. The main speaker is Johnny Rotten,and he gives his version of the story,which sounds a lot better than their manager,Mclaren. Has a great interview with Sid in 1978,a year before his death,he seems quite lively and funny, and it's quite sad that he died at 21. Overall a great flick.",975715200,,532,4.670212765957447
1265110,5,B00003CXHM,"The Filth and The Fury, in my opinion, was a very in-depth documentary about one of the greatest punk rock bands ever. Peering into the personalities of the members of the U.K. band, this movie would give even the most skepitcal person a whole new perspective on the Pistols. You get an inside look at what really went on within the band. There was more to them than their rude, obnoxious exteriors. In Filth, John Lydon (aka Johnny  Rotten) cries over the death of Sid Vicious. For anyone who thought that all he could do was yell and spit, this film is a must-see. For anyone who was and/or still is a fan of the Sex Pistols, you should definitely check this out.",975283200,5,665,4.40650406504065
1265111,5,B00003CXHM,"...to pull out all my old Pistols LPs and remember how fun they are to listen to.
This movie almost seemed to zip by too fast, but then, so did the Sex Pistols.  Come to think of it, the last 20 years (when I first started listening to them in junior high and chopped my hair off into a spike) also zipped by pretty fast...they put all the best songs, the best performances in here, along with some rare footage.
Sex Pistols fans may have already seen the interview with a nodded-out Sid Vicious and sleazy girlfriend Nancy Spungen (who makes Courtney Love on one of her bad days look like Grace Kelly in comparison) trying to wake him up for the camera as he snores (""Sid, wake up...they're tryin' ta interview ya...""). But what no fans may not have seen is a short, heartbreaking clip of an interview with Vicious after he is out on bail after being arrested for her murder. When the interviewer thoughtlessly asks him if he's 'having fun right now' (what was that reporter thinking? the kid looks completely miserable), Vicious just chuckles bitterly and asks him, ""Are you kidding? No, I'm not having any fun, at all."" When the interviewer asks him where he wishes he was right now, Vicious' quiet, calm answer to the question is so chilling and heartfelt that it made every hair on my body stand on end.  In a scene shortly after, John Lydon talks about Sid getting his aforementioned wish, and for a minute you think that in the voice over he is laughing, because as a rule you don't see John Lydon displaying any other emotion other than general crankiness. Then you suddenly, shockingly realize he's actually in genuine tears over his dead boyhood friend.
But you can also see the fun the Sex Pistols had while it lasted-especially memorable during a retelling of how they played a children's party (still not sure what the story behind this was, or what the people who organized it were thinking, but it was a stroke of genius), with footage of them covered in cake after they start a food fight, to one of the Pistol's best songs (in my opinion), ""Bodies"". What struck me is how the Sex Pistols (who, at the time, were not far out of their teens themselves) look and act about the same age as the kids at the party. They are obviously having just as much fun as the kids, too- they try to look like tough punk rockers but can't wipe the smiles off their faces as they joyfully have a ball.
The soundtrack, timing, and editing are all perfect. ""Submission"", another of my favorite songs (and in my opinion, one of their more underrated ones) is played over the credits, and it fits perfectly. As I said, my one complaint that was it zipped by too fast, but talking with my husband after the movie, so did the Sex Pistols. One of the better rock documentaries I've seen. A must see for Sex Pistols fans.",971136000,50,2811,4.477582846003899
1265112,4,B00003CXHM,"I was born in 1983,so I never had any real insight on how influencial the Sex Pistols really were until I saw this film. Britan in the late 1970s was a grim place;unemployment,IRA bombs,recession,depression. These were the reasons why punk had to happen. The first truly great Pistols movie(after the disapointing Great Rock'N'Roll and Sid & Nancy).Excellent retropective interviews with the four surviving Pistols,a dazzling array of clips and concert footage and,best of all,previously unseen interview footage with the late Sid Vicious,who proves to be surprisingly articulate and intelligent. You can't help but feel touched when John Lydon sheds a tear for his deceased friend. An exhilerating,funny,tragic and insightful documentary. A must see.",969667200,11,751,5.654867256637168

There are mad  loads of us Pistols fans still out here after 20 some odd years waiting for  a movie about Sid, John, Paul and Steve that actually portrayed truth. We  wanted more than fiction, we wanted to see what it was like as a Sex Pistol  first hand, and who would know better than the Pistols themselves? Thats  what The Filth & the Fury was made to correct: the deciet that Malcom  McLaren projected into the enraged ""punk-rock"" audiences of the  late 1970's England scene. And amazingly, that fraud has lingered on into  the late nineties where the confusion about the true Sex Pistols is still  being pondered. As you will see, this film is based fully on the truth; no  scripts, no rehersals, just truth. Or as Mr. John Lydon would say, ""No  lies, No fake, No FRAUD!""",966988800,8,912,4.466666666666667

It's one of the most insightful looks you'll get into The Sex Pistols out there and features some great interviews and all the wonderful music the band is known for. As much as I enjoyed it, the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't offer any insight or input on the story other than the band's own. Other than that small complaint, it's still a great rockumentry and certainly worth watching!",1444780800,,517,4.285714285714286

  There is commentary from Malcolm, John, Steve, Glen, Sid, and Paul but mostly the group.  The Bromley Contingent is shown, and you can see Billy Idol, Sue Catwoman, and Siouxsi Sioux amongst the crowd.  There are video clips and past audio of Sid, and really, the only thing missing is Sid appearing in person like the rest of them.  Sad.  No one understood the heroin situation at all or even proper treatment.
There are clips of Nancy too, and her murder is also discussed.
Lots of great footage!",1436745600,,669,4.516666666666667
1265276,5,B00003CXHM,"Very worthwhile on many levels. It serves as an interesting record of an important punk band, of course. But it is so much more. The people story is fascinating. As a story of what real protest and dissent means, the movie is sobering and articulate. It's a wonderful tutorial on creative authenticity and integrity. And it serves as a definitive statement about the perils of national arrogance and the pursuit of empire. In a very real sense, people like Winston Churchill gave birth to Johnny Rotten. Britain, its royalty and its desire to rule the world earned ""God Save the Queen,"" and seeing the Sex Pistols delivering the reward with a vengeance is inspiring. Americans can look into this crystal ball and see what's coming. The Filth and the Fury, along with The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, should be mandatory viewing for all US college students.",1436659200,,867,4.864864864864865

I can't really think of anything I'd change. I love the setup of the dvd, the music, how the music perfectly introduces each new scene. I enjoy the background on British society at that time and how its conditions greatly inspired the band to be what it was. And to see the great video footage of the band in the past and to hear them speak so openly and honestly about the band and their passion for it- what a joy. On a closing note,Stone Jones comments during the showing of the infamous Grundy footage was hilarious and had me laughing out loud.

The feature is full of commentary from Johnny Rotten, Steve Jones, Paul Cook, and long lost bassist, Glen Matlock.

This DVD blew me away! I admire these men for just being honest and telling it like it is. It made me wish I had the kahunas to do the same ... they had the courage to stand up to society, authority, etc. to make their voices heard. And, at times, were just nuts. Very entertaining, interesting. Really enjoyed the flashes of 70s commercials/popular t.v.

1265341,5,B00003CXHM,"Almost all documentaries about popular music are schlock. This one isn't. It's a movie about The Sex Pistols, a band from 1970s England that you may have heard of. If you haven't, they were a punk rock band that is famous mostly for being famous. Much has been written about them; most of it apocryphal. At least half of this movie is from an earlier film entitled The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980). It was a campy pseudo documentary. It was terrible by design. The Filth And The Fury is a fairly straightforward documentary by comparison. It's chock full of interviews with the surviving band members (some of which is recycled) and rare live footage.

I like the Pistols but wasx kind of bored with it.  Pretty much watching a movie abotu the trainwreck that was the first tour and Sid Vicious.  Makes you wonder if the whole thing was a staged work to get kids into the Pistols.  Its amost contrived the manner why which they presented their music.

1265433,5,B00003CXHM,I'm not going to write 10 paragraghs.  I will keep it short/sweet.  This movie was beautiful..... every Sex Pistols fan under the sun will LOVE it. These guys had hearts as big as their cheeky senses of humour.  And that's where they all fooled us.  The music speaks for itself---and one forgets how much you loved it.  Sid and his GF Nancy.....were so much more pathetic/tragic than Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb's version EVER portrayed.  And it makes you WISH the Pistols had stayed the Pistols.

1265434,5,B00003CXHM,"""What you've seen in any documentary about any band before or since is how great and wonderful everything is. Its not the truth of it; its hell, its hard, its horrible, its enjoyable to a small degree, but if you know what you're doing it for, you'll tolerate all that. Because the work, at the end of the day, is what matters. We managed to offend all the people we were f***ing fed up with""

Thus intones one Johnny Rotten (aka John Lydon) over a credit sequence which emulates the opening of the legendary film version of Oliver's ""Richard III"" - and Lydon knows of which he speaks because as the teenage front-man of ""The Sex Pistols"", probably the singularly most reviled and misunderstood band of all time, he certainly had it harder than most.

To my mind, there's no two ways about it - ""The Sex Pistols"" are THE band that broke a fundamental law of physics by literally creating something out of the nothing of economic, social and cultural poverty that was England in the mid-seventies. And in this film, which remains probably the best music documentary ever made (and my personal favourite of all time), you get to hear, in their own words, how they charted a notorious course from being four disparate, penniless teenagers hanging around a rubber-ware shop on the King's Road to being banned from playing in the UK and pursued around the US by the CIA and FBI because they were considered such a threat to the establishment.

Listening to Lydon, Cook, Jones, Matlock and Vicious (in absentia) recounting their tale in silhouette over a wealth of material cobbled together from the films ""DOA"" and ""The Great Rock And Rock Swindle"", as well as hours of never before seen archive footage, gives you a devastatingly honest insight into not only the times and circumstances that formed them, but also the morass of scumbags, groupies, hangers-on and imbeciles that populate the gristle-mill of the music industry to this day.

One gets the impression that Julien Temple, who previously directed the Malcolm MacLaren propaganda exercise, ""The Great Rock And Roll Swindle"", is almost undertaking an act of atonement with this film and he wisely chooses to forego overt directorial flourishes in favour of just letting the parties involved speak for themselves.

Alternately hysterically funny, genuinely touching and occasionally chilling (Vicious' final words to camera are haunting), as a film it is never anything less than fascinating. And as strange as it may sound, I personally find it to be one of the most energizing and positive pieces of cinema that I've ever seen. I watch my copy regularly and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone despairing at the state of their lives - because if four council estate kids with nothing but a shed-load of anger (which really `is' an energy, when properly channeled) can change the world in their own shambolic way, then you can learn a lot from their example, whatever your age.",1254700800,,2940,4.872
1265435,3,B00003CXHM,"The Sex Pistols were an incendiary band that burned out in a flash, but their impact is still felt today. Their history is presented here through interviews and archival footage, and the documentary is fittingly dirty and gritty considering its subject matter. In addition to the story, there are several almost complete songs performed live in various venues. This is a must watch for fans, as well as anyone else interested in one of the most influential and infamous bands of the punk movement.",1236297600,,497,4.928571428571429
1265436,5,B00003CXHM,"Rarely have I viewed such an honestly documented interview with any band available on video. The Sex Pistols' singer, Johnny Rotten (now Lydon) is well known for his notorious intolerance of the music establishment, the class system and authority in general (with perhaps, a little more emphasis on the British monarchy). He's in his 50's now, and I was very interested, almost startled, to listen to his views on music, the hypocrisy of the media, and his deeply loyal friendship to Sid Vicious, which was expressed in a rare expression of emotion. He has since become a television personality, appearing on talk shows and at media events in both the United States and the UK. I found him especially witty and fiercly truthful, which was a standout in this film for me, as I'm just not used to such soulful honesty in what has become a music industry cesspool of spoiled brats, addicts, and sexually confused ""popstars"". Lydon calls it like it is, and I really admired everything he had to say. The other high point of the film is the unusually large amount of footage attributed to Sid Vicious. We see him ""smacked up"" most of the time, but there are several spots (with his crazy girlfriend noticably absent) when he lucidly explains his own frustrations up to the point in time he was being interviewed. All but Sid are hidden in the shadows of strategically positioned studio lighting, which aids in giving the surviving members a sense of immortality, yet raising up their fallen band mate out of the shadows for all to clearly see in living color, and most of the time, it ain't pretty. There are important video clips of the performers during the punk madness of their heydey in the late '70's that I've not seen before, and this was really special for me. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys the historical relevance of documentaries, such as this one, where a point in time is stopped for all to see - sometimes not glorious or flattering - yet, at other times, soulful and honest. Listening to a more mature group of Pistols; especially the witty articulation of Lydon's anecdotes and recollections, makes for an immensely enjoyable and interesting look into the souls of this seminal punk rock band.",1233446400,,2224,4.7642487046632125

Hearing Lydon, Cook, and Jones revisit a tumultuous time in their obnoxious young lives--and then seeing the real deal in TV interviews and concert tapes--is worth half the admission. But there are also rare on-camera conversations with doomed bassist Sid Vicious and snotty manipulator McLaren to round out the picture.

More than simply presenting the what's and where's, it also delves into the question of WHY punk rock became the phenomenom it did in mid-Seventies Britain. This is an absolute must-see film for anyone interested in the history of rock music. From the live footage of the Pistols wreaking havoc onstage, to the the genuine emotion displyed by John Lydon when discussing the heroin addiction and death of friend and bandmate Sid Vicious, this movie is simply incredible.

The movie depicts the history of one of the most controversial Rock bands ever: The Sex Pistols. This DVD is a widescreen version of the film and features an audio commentary by director Julien Temple. The story of the band is told chronologically, and we get to see some of the members of the band telling us their own point of view of their contribution to the band and what happened during the 26 months the band lasted. There is a lot of controversy about the figure of Sid Vicious, who was found dead (by overdose or suicide, or was it just the same?) after being charged for the murder of his partner Nancy. One of the things I like the most about the movie is the Extra Documentary ""Un-Defining Punk: An In Depth Examination of the Punk Movement"", a 35 minute long documentary that gives us a very good deep analysis of what punk was.
I recommend this movie to anybody who likes pop culture, the history of Rock, and more especifically, to punk fans and anybody who likes transgression in Art in any form. The movie is rated R, which is a pity because it can't be shown to teenagers who would benefit a lot from watching it.
P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to.

I loved this because it had the actually means of telling you what happened. With real interviews, even with Sid Vicious himself! Why should anyone have to buy anyother ""documentary"" when you have John Lydon himself telling you what happened? You have the actually televised interviews that made the pistols their ""filthy""-selves. This tells the story from begining to end, with no bull.

Finally, Sex Pistols fans can learn what happened, rather than being subjected to Malcolm McLaren's absurd farce and narcissistic mockumentary.

Somehow, though, after watching this, I felt that something was missing, possibly because they don't explore the music enough.  It feels as though they made a documentary about Band X-- it feels generic, and lacks the sharp edge that made the Sex Pistols brilliant.

In spite of that feeling, I can still recommend it any any Pistols fan.",1145059200,4,656,5.102803738317757
1265525,5,B00003CXHM,"This is easily one of the most compelling rock-documentaries ever made.  There are only a few people reviewing this (who probably hated them already) who didn't love it.  The reason is simple: this is a well-done, historically researched, and painfully frightening look at a moment in history, particularly English history.  Who'd have thought a rock band could provolk so much resentment and hatred?  But, when placed in historical context (with many many clips from contemporary television shows to give you that context) The Sex Pistols emerge as a shotgun blast of freedom in a very deteriorated culture.  What we see is an entire Britain; both the upper and lower classes in the depths of despair.  What else could have happened, apart from a war?

I don't really think much else that emerged from the ""punk"" era was worth the effort (apart from some of the more musical new wave acts), but the Pistols are frighteningly real.  Johnny Rotten's insistence that they were merely a combination of English Dance Hall Comedy and Richard III is both absurd and completely genuine.  And, considering that is exactly the reception they recieved in their mother country, it is not so extraordinary to think they were (lances down during ""Anarchy in the UK"") declaring war on it.

The moments of chaos surrounding ""God Save the Queen"" and their barge trip down the Thames is a massive peak, both historically and musically.  What else could be said?  ""They could have hanged us at traitors gate and it would have been applauded ..."" says Rotten and it would.

The aftermath, or Coda, is the decline that occures immediately Sid Viscious joins the band.  I make no arguement for the personel shift.  They felt it necessary, so it happened.  After a brief trip to the Berlin wall, the Pistols were so inspired to pen a couple of nitro-infused blasts at the Germans in the form of ""Holiday in the Sun"" and ""Belson was a Gas"" ... but, that didn't last long.  The American tour was the end.  The myth didn't mean anything in this country, apart from a freak show.  The bubble was punctured and Sid went down with it.

""Ever Get the Feeling you've been cheated?"" Rotten exclains, furiously looking out at their first full blown concert in San Francisco after perversely playing the south and hated.  The menace in his voice is so obvious as he sings ""No Fun"" that the watcher feels glued to this meltdown.  It is the end of Rock and Roll.  It has never really risen.  It has become a mere form of music and maybe that isn't so bad.  But, the myth died right there and then with those words.",1141603200,5,2579,4.690423162583519

Instead of giving up on trying to release Never Mind the Bollocks, they kept going no matter what. They had a ""nice"" little reputation going on for them in the press. But hey, that's just them.

1265530,5,B00003CXHM,"punk rock originally had almost no impact in the usa. it was a mostly british phenomenom brought on by very difficult economic times in england. the punk band that had the biggest impact on england was the sex pistols. the sex pistols viciously attacked (with words, music and outrageous publicity stunts) their society's traditions, morality and self image. in return they were throughly hated, physically attacked, beat up and knifed right on the streets of london. the british people hated them and wanted to kill them. all this makes for a very compelling true story. told as this flim is from the sex pistols point of view it makes their anger and resentment at their class divided society understandable and sympathetic. at the time 99.9% of the american people had never heard of the sex pistols. their usa tour was barely mentioned in the usa press. they never played nyc (media capital of the world). the people at the atlanta show (in the film) seemed to think that the sex pistols were some kind of glitter band. any suggestion that the sex pistols (or puck rock in general) was some kind of mighty force sweeping the country is revisionist wishfull thinking by people who were not around back then. punk rock never had much impact in america. still this story of the sex pistols is a weird, compelling slice of true life. highly recommended.",1120262400,3,1353,4.786324786324786

The thing that I did not like the film was that the Ramones and the Clash were not mentioned. The Ramones started the whole sound, and the clash and the pistols were like brothers.

1265602,5,B00003CXHM,"OK, watched the Sex Pistols documentary ""The Filth and the Fury."" A recent flick, it came out in 2000 and interviewed the surviving members of the Pistols, though they were but silhouettes residing in the comfort of midlife homes. It's an extraordinary documentary detailing the rise of punk and the brief life of the Sex Pistols. They played but for two years, banned, hated and vilified. The documentary ends appropriately enough during their final show with Sid Vicious in San Francisco, with Johnny Rotten sadly sneering to the audience, ""Do you ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""

I suppose everyone is familiar with the legend of the Sex Pistols, and if you're not, this documentary is as good a place to start as any. What I liked about ""The Filth and the Fury"" was how accurately it detailed the conditions in England that gave rise to punk music and fashion. Americans love to claim everything as their own, and the Ramones have certainly carried that ""punk creation"" torch to their graves. But ""The Filth and the Fury"" slaps everyone back into reality. The Sex Pistols were the first, and that LP ""Never Mind the Bullocks"" echoes down through generations as crystal clear as a golden coin.

After watching this documentary and listening to their album, I am amazed how contemporary the Sex Pistols are. Much of the music that followed, The Clash, The Misfits, The Circle Jerks, even U2, feels oddly dated today, a testament of the decade of the 1980s. But place the Sex Pistols on the air, and blasting from the speakers is incredible anger and energy, as profound and timeless as ""A Clockwork Orange."" The music has aged well, and one never blushes when listening to it.

Watching the documentary, I was amazed how modern the members of the band looked, interviewed by 70s fashion victims adorned in wide lapels, offensive plaid and flared pants. These reporters, attempting to make sense, were as befuddled as JFK assassination reporters, trying to nurture terrified audiences. The sad fact, and one which is detailed in ""The Filth and the Fury,"" is that the band eventually became a freak show, the music forgotten or lost by the time they wearily limped on stage in San Francisco.

The footage which haunts and terrifies, is of the Sex Pistols playing their infamous 1978 tour through the southern United States. Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta, Memphis, long-haired crowds resembling frightened Bob Seegers. Audiences threw trash on the stage, beer bottles at Sid Vicious' face, and yet the band played on, realizing that America was a scary place......""Throw what you want at me, I'm not leaving this stage!""

Can you imagine a band like the Sex Pistols playing here today? They would get lynched. American music writers wax poetic about the Sex Pistols' cruise through Texas and the south. But we see footage of the San Antonio and Dallas shows, people standing as stark as statues, terrified of what they were witnessing. The echoes of those concerts carry through to today, profound and horrifying. For the Sex Pistols to have embarked through the southern U.S. with that incredibly blatant brand of rebellion was almost suicidal. They cut a path through a dense forest of a conservative Urban Cowboy rocker wastelands. The wake splashes today.

The Sex Pistols band died young, no doubt. They have but one album, and a lot of haunting film footage. But to watch them in this documentary during their prime, fiercely screaming ""Anarchy in the UK,"" ""God Save the Queen"" and ""Bodies,"" is to see the ultimate example of what the musical form known as rock represents. They scared the establishment. They freaked it out. Working class and brutal, the Sex Pistols were the revolution that crushed the flowers of Woodstock. There are no ballads in ""The Filth and the Fury."" Just a slap reverberating across generations.

This is one of the greatest rock documentaries ever made.",1103500800,38,3896,4.929878048780488
1265603,5,B00003CXHM,"""The Filth and the Fury"" is not just a great rockumentary it is a great document of the social upheaval that occurred during the heyday of the Sex Pistols.  The decay that was occuring in Britain in the mid 1970's mirrored that of the established music industry i.e. Rod Stewart, etc.  There was anger fomenting among the masses and the Sex Pistols were the response to that.  Aside from great concert footage on hand here, there are great interviews with the surviving members of the band.  Rotten, Jones, Cook, Matlock let it be known that they were not mere puppets of the machinations of manager Malcolm McLaren that they had a voice in the message that they were conveying.  The film is also an effective diatribe against drug addiction by relating the sad fate of late bassist Sid Vicious, a naive youth who was unprepared for the pitfalls of fame and it's inherent temptations.  Definitely avoid Alex Cox's ""Sid and Nancy"", a glamorized depiction of Sid's downfall.  If you're not interested in the history, the music on hand is still good.",1102204800,3,1047,4.751381215469613
1265604,5,B00003CXHM,"The Filth and The Fury is an exemplary film about an significant period in British history - the late 1970's.  It should be shown in every high school history class.  Director Julien Temple gets another crack at the Sex Pistols as his subject after 1980's ""The Great Rock n' Roll Swindle"", but with a new twist - humanity.

This is a humourous and touching film - especially when Rotten comes to tears while speaking of Sid's demise.  Who would have thought that the closest bond in the band would be between Rotten and Vicious.  The narration was by each band member in silhouette - clearly illustrating their feeling that they had all been rape victims.  The ""rapist"" himself, manager Malcolm McLaren is represented by a respiring black rubber mask - the bondage that restricted the band.  Juxtaposed throughout are scenes from British comedy shows from which Rotten amassed his wide range of spectacular facial expressions, and scenes from Richard The III, in which Laurence Olivier spouts lines perfectly coinciding with the Pistols' own story.  After all, they had an exceptional sense of theatrics.

Though they were hygienically and linguistically foul, the racket the Pistols made was pristine and clear in its intent.  Though the lyrics were snide and bleak, they were a mad celebration of youth and rebellion.  The music was actually quite melodic and uplifting, probably due to bassist Glen Matlock's love of the Beatles.  The chorus of ""No Future""  was a glorious anti-national anthem, sung with exuberance and joy despite the fact that the message was a pessimistic one.  The dirge-like ""We Shall Overcome"" was sung by Martin Luther King's followers with poignant sadness, yet the Pistols' ""No Future"" was chanted in pure hopeless reverie - against the monarchy, against youth repression, against discrimination, and against disco. Watching people in flares trodding through all the trash in London's streets during the garbage strike, Rotten saw they were clearly missing the point; ""Wear the garbage bag!""  The Pistols' punk fashion; ripped and pinned clothing was actually created out of poverty.

Whether floating down the Thames on a barge playing ""God Save The Queen"" on the day of the queen's Silver Jubilee or performing for missile-tossing rednecks in Texas, the Pistols remained resilient and allegiant to their kamikaze mission  All the energy put into banning them both in the UK and the US forcing them to play under assumed names caused more of a sensation than the harmless Pistols would have ever caused on their own.

The live concert footage (overdubbed with studio tracks) is remarkable, especially a charity party the band played at for children of firemen who had lost their jobs.  Rotten proclaims it one of the best times he had, being lovingly covered in cream pies by very young children as he sang, ""Mommy, I'm not an animal""!  Quite touching.

The band's moniker was conceived by McLaren to depict A Clockwork Orange sort of maniacal youth gang; a pack of sexy guys brandishing weapons, but the Pistols were actually too charmingly laughable to pull off that image.  The shots of the band as cheeky kids with mischievous smiles against a soundtrack of the Pistols' dauntless anarchistic diatribes on television depicted their genuine innocence.  All they really did was tell the truth, and as Rotten says, ""We declared war on England without meaning to.""",1098489600,13,3394,5.0647482014388485
1265605,4,B00003CXHM,"I found the movie a little boring at times (except for the amazing old footage of the Sex Pistols in the late 70's era).

I thought it was a bit dramatic how when they interviewed Steve Jones,John Lydon,and Paul Cook that they wouldn't show their faces. Some of the things they were saying were very repetitive. If you want to know more about the Sex Pistols,I would suggest watching this movie. It corresponds very well to John Lydon's ""Rotten:No Irish,No Blacks,No Dogs"".",1096848000,,473,4.7682926829268295
1265606,3,B00003CXHM,"For some reason, Julien Temple has made not one, but two documentaries on the Sex Pistols.  The first and slightly better film was THE GREAT ROCK AND ROLL SWINDLE, and tells the Sex Pistols' story more or less from Malcolm McLaren's perspective.  This second film, besides being messier than the earlier one, is far less original.  It actually culls considerable hunks from the earlier film, but despite this manages to be the mirror image of the other.  Instead of telling things from the standpoint of McLaren, it is told from the standpoint of the band members, and they clearly don't like him at all.

It is amazing that Temple, who has actually made some good films over the years, has managed to make two poor films on the Sex Pistols.  One would think that making a good documentary about the Sex Pistols would be as easy as catching fish in a bathtub.  They were so outrageous, so dramatic, their impact on society so huge that it would be simply a matter of casually editing already existing footage.  But what we have in THE FILTH AND THE FURY is a visual mess, almost borderline incoherent at times, almost completely without any new insight into the Sex Pistols, and with the insertion of a host of images that aren't really relevant to the time or their story.  Why, for instance, the absolutely endless excerpts from Laurence Olivier's RICHARD III.  The pretentiousness of the film can hardly be overstated.  For instance, in contemporary interviews, the members of the band are left in darkness, as if they were part of a witness protection program.

One of the points of the film seems to be to minimize the role that McLaren played in creating the band, as if the four members of the Sex Pistols pulled the whole enterprise together.  Besides being enormously self-serving, it overlooks a number of key facts.  For instance, McLaren's time spent in New York earlier in the 1970s, getting to know bands and performers like Television, Richard Hell, the Ramones, and deciding that he would like to import something like that into London.  Indeed, his first choice for the lead singer of the Sex Pistols was Richard Hell, who originated the fashion styles that were later associated with the Sex Pistols.  Hell declined, deciding to stay in New York, but Hell's dress code provided the pattern for much of the clothing available in Sex, McLaren's boutique.  Typically, the documentary leaves Hell out of the story entirely.  The worst thing about pushing McLaren to the periphery of the story, as if he were lucky to be along for the ride rather than the owner of the ride, is that it leaves out the ideological context for the punk movement.  Was McLaren the exploitative jerk that especially Johnny Rotten asserts that he was?  It is entirely possible, but even if so it doesn't negate the formative role he played.

Where the film excels and where it gets quite good is when the members of the band, especially John Lydon, talk about what went wrong with the band and with the punk movement.  There is also some great footage of the Sex Pistols performing live, but very nearly all of this is dubbed with studio recordings.  This is not merely dishonest, it considerably lessens the value of the film.  Luckily, much of the American footage contains the original soundtrack, including the absolutely chilling ""No Fun"" from their final concert in San Francisco.  The way Johnny Rotten keeps growling the words ""No fun"" while sitting in a crouch on the stage sounds more like a lesson in metaphysics than a confession.  It is a stunning bit, made more complete by the visibly distraught Steve Jones to the side of Rotten.

In the end, this is an important film for anyone interested in rock, punk, or the Sex Pistols.  But one nonetheless feels frustration that a filmmaker with such extraordinary access to the band members had to mar his film with so much needless and irrelevant footage of British comedians and Laurence Olivier's RICHARD III.  He would have done better to focus more distinctly on the band itself.",1093305600,10,4033,4.779220779220779
1265607,5,B00003CXHM,"Filthy, awful, horrible words at that. The film beautifully outlines the short history of those quintessential punk rock icons, the Sex Pistols, from their painful birth out of the English social strife in the late 1970's, to the heights of infamy, to their on-stage self-destruction just two years later. A must-see for any alt. rock fan. The ""cut and paste"" quality of the piece might rub some the wrong way, but I feel it fits the subject matter like a glove. If you have an interest in punk rock, or in general hellrazing, you're gonna want to see this!

1265608,4,B00003CXHM,"It's not immediately apparent where Punk stands in historical terms.  There were only a handful of great bands, the music was rarely memorable, and the whole thing (the real thing I mean, not the post-punk posing) was practically over within four years.  Compared with the sixties, when the pop movement encompassed a revolution in sexual habits, drug-taking, fashion, music, film, civil rights, concepts of individuality and community, and even took on and managed to end a major war, it looks like Punk was just one of a number of notable ripples (another being Red Brigades-style terrorism) which extended outwards after 1969.
But ripple or not, it had a bigger cultural impact than anything else on my teenage years:  I clearly remember in 1978 a friend pulling out his latest purchase, a record called ""Never Mind the Bollocks"" and how completely staggered I felt when I looked at this luminous urine-yellow cover, took in the ransom-note font and then heard the noise - I couldn't comprehend it as music at first - of the first few tracks.  These bits of vinyl and card seemed at the time as dangerous a thing as a shipment of heroin.
Basically I and most of Britain was in a daze when the Pistols appeared.  The sixties had been a huge upheaval, but the energy seemed to dissipate as rapidly as it had appeared.  By 1974 the oil embargo, massive inflation, strikes, terrorism, pomp rock, et. al. had all but crushed the mod movement and the airwaves were jammed with coma-inducing pop like the Bay City Rollers and Abba.  Moreover, the ""establishment"", that is the traditional structures of power, having been battered halfway to oblivion in the sixties, were gradually and rather insidiously reasserting themselves.
What this film captures is the electrifying effect the Pistols had on a country that had become complacent in its own dismalness.  The famous Grundy interview is as notable now for the toe-curling triteness of daytime TV of that time as for the naughtiness of the Pistols.  Footage of the housing estates from whence the group emerged reveals the brutal starkness of urban working-class Britain.  With the rubbish piling up on the streets thanks to another strike and utter shabbiness seemingly everywhere, there's a strong impression of a country at the nadir of a massive multi-year hangover.  The Pistols woke the country up like an exploding alarm clock, caused an outcry that seems almost funny in retrospect, and made flares, permed hair on males and Emerson Lake and Palmer utterly unfashionable for a couple of decades.
On a more serious note, it is also worth considering that Punk probably helped Mrs. Thatcher get elected in 1979.  Much of the population was shocked into believing that a strong law and order Government was the only hope for Britain.  So perhaps a bit more than just a historical ripple, albeit in a very ironic manner?
As for the Pistols themselves, it is not hard to see why they only lasted a couple of years:  they are the (mostly) living proof that anarchy is great in theory but hard to sustain in practice.  There is a lot of bitching between the boys twenty-plus years on, and while most other reviewers seem to have found Rotten inspirational, I thought he was full of s***, moaning about just about everything including bizarre things such as once having had to stay in a motel.  Apparently blind to irony, he even at one point launches a heartfelt attack on the people he considers let Sid down:  ""they had no respect"" he wails.
Good film of a fascinating time with well-chosen footage, witty asides (nice idea to compare the Pistols with Richard III), wild music and interesting interviews.  My only complaint is that it was difficult to work out who was talking in the voiceovers and not always easy to hear them either.",1087776000,4,3786,4.85248447204969
1265609,5,B00003CXHM,"Somewhere in a Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs suburbs a soccer mom just unloaded her brood for the match after the Soccer-mom 7-3 shift at the office and now has to go home help the digital-literate Nascar dad with the dinner and hope that the kids are home and the plates are in the dishwasher in time for American Idull, only to find a friend of a friend's copy of The Filth and the Fury laying about, daring you to pop it in the player and find out what rock'n roll was meant to be about before she swoon's to another syrup drip balladeer over-singing supper club karoake standards.  Maybe it would be of interest to the aspiring American consumer stereotypes that much of Simon Cowell's ubersnob delivery can be attributed to Pistol's head snarler Johnny Rotten.  Their curiosity peaked, they drop it in and discover the Amercian consumer's lifestyle is under bombardment, even though the Filth's recollecting anti- establishment and chaos in the 70's.
  Remarkably, one of the instant revelatory moments in this film is how up to date the Pistols look compared to the ridiculously vomitous slabs of polyesteryear fashions their supposedly hip hosts were wearing during the old interview clips.  What's more, this is exactly what Lydon (Rotten) hates the most about the Pistols legacy: the mall culture they so deplored finds ""punk fashion"" cool and watered it down to flavorless damp 4/4-time whining while doing nothing to deconstruct the world into a better place.  This is also where the Pistols couldn't last.  They were too messed up to fix a world they wanted to destroy.  Rotten remains gloriously disgusted throughout the film often leaving your Mom and Dad (who grew up familiar with the Pistols and continously failing to understand them) wondering why he's still in it (to give bollocky pissoff to mums and dads of course).
  The other Pistols will continue to provide vigor towards their old antics in rollickingly funny interviews.  The serious viewer will understand that Chaos was their goal and not making punk fashionable.  And if the soccer mom and Nextel Cup Pops take a second or two to think about how this film and the Chaos that was the Pistols' true legacy are meant to affect them..just imagine..perhaps the world may be a little more dangerous, but it won't be boring and we won't feel cheated.",1087084800,2,2326,4.920716112531969
1265680,4,B00003CXHM,"Wow.  The Sex Pistols?  Never heard a more perfect name for a band.  Immediately conjures up all sorts of images.  Then seeing photographs of the band and the environment they spawned: like walking into a cultural junk shop and finding some wild, interesting things.  Then you hear the music, and you KNOW that things will be all right.  The documentary was like watching a wildly painted, gravelly sounding, busted-up auto running laps around the neighborhood grandstand.  I watched this documentary twice in one night just to confirm my impressions were true.

Memories of this sort are like a giant bonfire that everyone throws logs on to keep it going.  For the first time, the Pistols toss there own logs onto the fire.  Just the thought of the backdrops, colors and possibilities attached to that time and place are wondrous enough.  It seemed so open, raunchy and ugly that you can run a million scenarios in your head and still have room for more.  The Sex Pistols were at the apex of all this: an accident, a force of nature.

The title alone, THE FILTH AND THE FURY, suggests so much about what you are about to experience.  You are told a story in a chaotic manner, images hurled at you - grainy, black and white concert footage; crazy, young English kids acting like they just don't care; seedy bars, streets and garbage dumps; representatives of various government, media and church organizations.  Lots of news reels and garish lights.  The surviving band members tell their own versions of what happened; their faces cast in shadow to keep you carefully tuned in to the images of the time period.  Essentially a history lesson taught by the people who created, and were created by, the moment.  I thought it was well done - but left me wanting more. But that was OK, too.  Their career was so abrupt, 26 months from start to end - which I think has much to do with interest in them to this day.

""High drama"" as John Lydon describes it - is exactly it.  Everything suggested by the Sex Pistols, all the random images and brilliant simplicity of the music just feeds the imagination.  You can't create that kind of magic with high gloss and untouchable superstars.  For my money, Steve Jones was the best interview in the whole thing.  The guy is hilarious!  He seems like someone you'd find at a bar telling to his mostly true war stories.  The commentary by Julien Temple is extremely dull and doesn't add much.  The other punk documentary, if it serves any purpose at all, illustrates where they could have gone wrong in the making of THE FILTH AND THE FURY.  So, you may want to rent first, but you'll end up grabbing a copy for yourself.  It doesn't wear thin with repeat viewings.

There was a time when Super Tramp and Styx were considered rock 'n' roll.  England was in ruins and the Pistols were pissed.  Angry young men making desperate music that touched everyone within earshot.  The Grundy interview is shown, the Queen's Jubilee boat ride, and some cartoons from the Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.

They can stuff their punk credentials, with all their money up their a**. ANARCHY IN THE UK WHAT A BUNCH OF BOLLOCKS, what did they ever do to live out that dream.

1265684,4,B00003CXHM,"From formation in a fetish store in late 1975 to implosion in San Francisco in 1978, the Sex Pistols were the Bashi-Bazouks of punk music, bringing the sound to millions of listeners.  They came to embody the movement, whether as music of working class rage or songs of snotty adolescent rebellion.
The members' personalities were wildly different, fistfights were frequent and the Pistols replaced Glen Matlock, their bassist and best songwriter, with Sid Vicious, a sad heroin addict who literally could not play his instrument, in early 1977.  The band was only together for 26 months, and to paraphrase Gibbon, we should ask not why it broke up but why it lasted so long.
The film's answer, basically, is the Pistols had nowhere else to go.  Guitarist Steve Jones says he hated playing guitar in early rehearsals but stuck with it because he didn't have anything else.  It took Vicious' slide in heroin addiction and manager Malcolm McLaren's mismanagement to finally lead to the last concert, where singer Johnny Rotten said, more with weariness than contempt, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""
""The Filth and the Fury"" is an enjoyable, interesting piece that puts the Pistols in the context of their times.  It makes a few bold sallies toward objectivity (for the band's reputation as a scream against the British establishment, Jones says he didn't know who the PM was and just wanted sex) but is essentially hero worship, as all rock documentaries are.
That's not necessarily a problem, but the movie strongly suggests the whole of England was against the Pistols, which not only downplays the support they had from music critics who were as sick of Emerson, Lake and Palmer as they were but suggests punk was being listened to all over the country. In reality, it had something more than a cult following, but not much; the fear of punk gaining a broader audience drove much of the opposition documented here.
Director Julien Temple, in his otherwise awful DVD commentary, points out he made ""The Great Rock N' Roll Swindle"" in 1979 to dispel some of the hero worship the band had developed, thought it went too far and made ""Filth"" as a corrective.  OK.  But the movie puts the Pistols back on their pedestals, which means their influences (Alice Cooper, the Modern Lovers, the New York Dolls) and more durable bands like The Clash suffer in comparison.  You'd think punk owed everything to the Pistols after seeing this, and that ain't the case.
That said, it would take a filmmaker of rare incompetence to make the Pistols' meteoric story boring, and Temple has gift for both narrative and humor.  Rotten has one ego trip too many in his interview, but both he and the other members of the band provide new insights and details about the Pistols' troubled life.  McLaren is heard only through audio he recorded for ""Swindle,"" and it may be unfair, but the evidence doesn't weigh well in his favor.  You get to see footage of ""Who Killed Bambi?"" the lousy film the Pistols did (with an appearance by Sting) and a previously unseen 1978 interview with Vicious, who speaks with a surly eloquence.
It's great storytelling about a singular moment in time.  The Pistols may have an importance out of proportion to their recorded legacy, but ""Filth"" does justice to their peculiar place in music.",1071187200,6,3311,4.851063829787234
1265685,5,B00003CXHM,"superflykai gives an excellent review below and says exactly what I would have said, if I had only gotten here first.  So I won't try and top it.
What I will say though is that this is probably my favorite film of all time.  You can tell that this was a real work of love.  The editing is unbelievable and is actually more of an art film than anything else.  Johnny Rottens naration just pulls you in. You see how intelligent he really is.  No censorship here.  There are virtually endless amounts of original scenes intercut in the most thoughtful way. Great interviews with Sid Vicious and silly scenes of him walking through the High Park in London with his swastika t-shirt and black leather jacket freaking everyone out.  Great live performance scenes and you see that Steve Jones plays guitar as good on stage as he did in the studio.  It's amazing to see how great they really were.  There are also some heartfelt moments where Johnny feels a geat sense of sorrow about not knowing how to help Sid and he holds back the tears as he remembers how the papers exploited Sid's death and made a joke out of it.  Too much material in this film to even begin to cover it. It's simply a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone with a mind.
If you care about rock and roll as a means of social consiousness or as a way of personal liberation from all the social stupidiy, or if you ever dared rebel against authority, then this is a film for you and about you.  I don't know any other band who did what the Sex Pistols did.  Everything else now seems boring to me.
My only complaint is that the film left me wanting for more.  I've now seen all these great little clips of all these shows and all this chaos and I just want to see more of it.. I hope they release an updated version.  I would like to see the entire Sid and Nancy interviews on a bonus disc.  That would be great. I'd like to see more live shows complete from start to finish. The bonus materials on the disc aren't that great.  Not much really.  Only a couple of items..
I would also recommend Johnny Rottens autobiography, ""Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks No Dogs"" (title taken from a common sign which hung outside pubs in England in the 50's""",1065830400,2,2213,4.306763285024155

Contrasting with The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle, this punkumentary is told by the band members (including Sid) as opposed to McLaren. It would have been nice to have heard his reaction to the way Jones, Cook and expecially Lydon tell it but I suppose they would not have participated if McLaren was involved at all.
You have to look past Temple's style of documentary: it appeared to be a 'yoof' orientated aural and visual assualt on the senses or maybe this is the 'punk' way of making documentaries. The silhouettes of the Pistols was annoying, I can see no real reason for it. And unless I'm mistaken, a lot of the dialogue was out of sync with the pictures; was this deliberate? Again, I see no reason for it to be.

1265687,4,B00003CXHM,"Julien Temple and The Sex Pistol's anecdote to ""Sid & Nancy.""
The documentary ""The Filth and the Fury"" amounts to personal points of view from the band members brought forefront, with actual recorded video footage over two decades old. Johnny Rotten blasts Malcolm McClaren, Steve and Paul blast Sid's awful bass playing skills, and everyone gangs up on Glen... sounds like the Pistols to me!
The documentary is a sociocultural and historical perspective from the band members pertaining to everything from Great Britain's economic depression during the late 1970's, to individual opinions on the creative stagnation of musical creativity that plagued popular music during the period. Actual video footage acts as a band diary in revealing the complex issues each fool had to deal with.
The interview with Sid Vicious is absolutely classic, the live action sequences of filthy, underground dive shows with the audience hanging on for the ride capture the pure essence which seems to have been lost in this modern day arena rock period. The indigence scene will always be a means of new and more creative sounds and it seems as though after watching this movie, you may have missed out on something good.
The documentary is superfluously laced with ancient clips of an English version of Richard III at the beginning of the documentary, only to taper off towards the end. The documentary is full of scenes cutting and switching to events, while back-tracking to live interviews where band members are sitting in dark rooms to hide their aged faces... as more and more natural light fills their rooms, you begin to see the outlines of their faces. Of course there are other documentaries on the Sex Pistol that have live interviews with their current aged selves... there is one documentary entitled ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"" which has an up to date interview with Malcolm McClaren and the rest of the gang.
With a background score almost entirely consisting of Pistol songs, excellent footage of riots in England, and the documentation of the band's self-destruction, right along with Nancy and Sid's self-destruction, the movie ends itself on gloomy circumstances where Mr. Rotten encourages people to see life his way.
The movie is an absolutely wonderful watch, even if you never had the chance to enjoy The Sex Pistols or punk rock for the matter.",1055462400,6,2375,5.0458015267175576
1265688,4,B00003CXHM,"The ""Filth and the Fury"" brings you the auto-biographic history of the Sex Pistols. It is the only movie that revisits the era in which the Pistols stormed onto the music scene, saying ...You"" to meanstream music, only to crash and burn in their visit to the United States, from the surviving band members point of view.
The Sex Pistols give you everything you need to know about them in this movie. Their hatred for British society and government in the 1970s, as well as their hatred for their manager, Malcolm McLaren. It effectively displayed the effect their music had to their audience, showing the transition of style from show to show. (If you are particular squimess to fetish or baby pin piercings, do not watch this movie). And, rather humorously, ""The Filth and the Fury"" shows what ... off meanstream society about the Pistols.
Perhaps what is most memorizing about the movie is Johnny Rotten's emotional response to the death of his good friend and bass player, Sid Vicious. It is a side of Rotten that few will ever see, and the moment would have been even greater if he wasn't covered by a shadow. (All band members, in reflecting on the past, are covered with shadows)
With qoutes from ""Paradise Lost"" and clips from Shakespeare productions, the director seems to think his movie is advertised to British Literature majors. Malcolm McLaren's point of view is basicly eliminated. He is limited only to sound bites voiced over a man in a perversive leather mask. McLaren's portrayal in the movie is both distasteful and bias.
Other than these few problems, the movie is great when showing who the Pistols are and how and why they ...off England. You do not have to be a Sex Pistol fan to see this movie.",1040169600,2,1718,4.710963455149502
1265689,4,B00003CXHM,"The surreal documentary of the rise and fall of the punk band the Sex Pistols is a very captivating film directed by Julien Temple.  The filming techniques and the multitude of clips that enhanced the documentary ranging from cuts of the bands performances, ads taken from British television shows, the beginnings of a social collapse in Britain portrayed by the garbage strike and street demonstrations tell a very empowering story.
I thought it did an excellent job of giving an accurate account about the exciting, repulsive, offensive and even pitiful lives of the band members who were ostracized and hated by most of the British society.  Yet it also portrayed the huge punk movement and culture they began and the people whom lived off of the rebellious vibes of their music.  Music in a sense can be cult-like, and in this situation it was.  Though each band member had their own personal problems besides the frequent inter-band disagreements, still a sense of a common following was founded based on revolution.
Their short-lived music career was nothing more than a harsh statement about life: living it and getting by.  At their last show in San Francisco Rotten announced his lack of enjoyment with his music career and even stopped short in playing the final song of the set.  His famous line after this says it best, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?""  Yes, moments in life come and go, and in the situation of the Sex Pistols their run was over, but the movement they started will never be forgotten.  This extremely comprehensive documentary shouts this out loud and clear.  The band scared people, it made them question their beliefs, and it made them think.
Though I thought the film dished out important messages, it was also rather drawn out and repetitive.  It seemed as though the assembling of the band as well as the breakup were the most important aspects of the documentary; the middle could have been more compressed and had just as strong of an affect.  Coming from a viewer who had never encountered the history of the Sex Pistols before, the documentary was confusing at points, but had a strong appeal and left me wanting to find out more about this influential band.",1039564800,2,2208,4.8302387267904505
1265800,3,B00003CXHM,"The Filth and the Fury, a documentary about the Sex Pistols, is a whirlwind of anarchy in the UK, punk culture, and dirty rebellion. Hours of footage and interviews are chaotically compiled by director Julien Temple into one story about the turbulent two year career of the band that defined punk style in the late seventies. Although somewhat hard to follow due to the hundreds of images quickly thrown at its audience, this film is ultimately a poignant portrayal of the true story of the legendary Sex Pistols.
 Out to set the record straight after manager Malcolm McLaren apparently bastardized the image of the Pistols in his film Sid and Nancy, Johnny Rotten and the surviving members of the band tell their version of things, the way they really happened (according to Rotten). Even including old interviews with the late Sid Vicious, the documentary thoroughly covers the sentiments of all the band members, however long or short their time spent with the band happened to be. Interestingly though, Rotten and the others chose to hide their faces during their interviews; perhaps this was to be sure that they presented themselves as they were, not as they are today, preserving the image they worked so hard to maintain in the seventies. Their story was told in a very frank way, allowing the audience to see into the very souls of the Sex Pistols members.
 This film was at best moving, at worst repetitive. Rotten felt he had to prove, very effectively, what the Pistols were all about, which he is able to accomplish, but as a result we see too many images over and over again, and hear the single ""Anarchy in the UK"" played repeatedly, to the point where it seems the band's image is being shoved down our throats. Still, we can't help but feel bad for the poor blokes as we watch them get dropped from record companies, and violently degraded by media figures everywhere. When Rotten says, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" at the Sex Pistols' last show, we can't help but feel bad for the band that just tried to exert their right to be punk, anarchist individuals in the face of almost complete intolerance and constant discrimination. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? They most definitely have.",1039564800,3,2230,4.78961038961039

1265803,4,B00003CXHM,"This DVD is fine, the quality is a bit grainy and I would have enjoyed more extras, but it's fine.
The ""documentary"", if one can call it such, is typical ""Pistols fare"" and has become a cliche by this point. The style of ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle"" has been replicated on the Filth and the Fury (and countless other Sex Pistols histories since) so much so that it would interesting to see someone tell the Pistol's story straight and without all the deliberately choppy editing style like an editorial montage.
I found the ""style"" of the film to be not only fairly unoriginal, but also distracting. What's with Johnny Rotten and these clips of Sir Laurence Olivier in the role of Shakesphere's Richard III? I get the reference, but isn't it redundant to keep switching back & forth between Olivier's performance and Rotten's onstage? I certainly thought so anyway.
No telling of the Sex Pistol's extreme history could ever possibly be dull and this film is no exception. If you don't know the band's history, then you really don't know what you're missing. Things were much wilder back then.
For my money, 1978's ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle"" is still the best Sex Pistols film available...indeed it is a work of art in its own right, apart from just its subject matter. I would recommend that film instead and also make a plea for someone/anyone to please reissue it on DVD soon.",1029456000,3,1386,4.661224489795918
1265804,4,B00003CXHM,"Before i saw this film, all i knew about the Sex Pistols was what i heard from the albums Bollocks and R&R swindle, and some stories here and there that seem mostly exaggerated to fit them into some legendary punk rock god status.
So, for me, this movie was very interesting.  The thing that is most interesting about it is that it seems to document both the birth and death of the entire Punk Rock spirit as it existed in England all in 100 minutes.
The whole ""story"" is told very simply and as clearly as it can be.  We see a small group of people having fun and expressing themselves in new ways grow into a very large group of people who buy into the whole ""look and feel"" of the movement as a trend, and through it all, we get anecdotes about how the members of the Sex Pistols fit into the whole thing... from their first gig to the very last.. all the way to the death of Sid.
I think anyone interested in music would enjoy this movie.  I don't mind that the concert footage is overdubbed, or that the songs are interrupted with ""chatter"" as one reviewer stated.  After all, that ""chatter"" is why i bought the movie in the first place.  I knew i wasn't buying a concert film.

Culled from hours of interviews and concert footage, this is as close as you can get to the reality that was punk rocks' ultimate bad boys. Just watching this gives a real feeling of the energy, angst and ultimately, the doom which the band came to. In a particularly telling clip of Sid, an interviewer asks him: ""Where do you want to be?"" to which he responds: ""Underground."" He got his wish and so did the band. The no holds barred look at this time in history in England gives an inciteful 'Why' to their over-amped 'How.' The surviving members are shown in silouette throughout and give commentary which helps explain the phases that they went through before imploding in San Francisco circa January of '78. Their manager--- Malcolm McLaren is exposed as the exploitative svengali who made money while the band more or less starved during their prime.

 I didn't care to much for the film but it did show music and how it influences its
followers.  To really enjoy this movie you have to have a knowledge of the Sex Pistols to
understand it fully.  I am sure that if you were a fan of them that you would enjoy this film.  It
also was hard to understand their English.  You had to listen real close to understand what they
were saying.  I would highly recommend this film to people that like or even know a little bit
about the band.  Otherwise I would not recommend it to others.
 I couldn't identify with any of the characters because they were the opposite of me.  They
were hard partying musicians.  They were rude and dressed in torn clothes.  But I could identify
with their being (upset) at how the world was treating them.
 I think the message in the film of teen culture was that you can be anything you want.
That you don't have to sct a certain way if you don't want to.  It gave teens a difference between
their parents which is needed to ""find yourself.""  It is a good point in the movie but it is difficult

1265919,4,B00003CXHM,"If you're in the mood for a edgy documentary, why then you've came to the right place.  The Filth and the Fury is a well-done documentary about the Sex Pistols that was put together 18 years after the demise of the band.  The movie did a good job representing the Sex Pistols and all they stood for- I just wish that it would have gone more in depth on their music and history.
I've seen documentaries on bands before, but none that went in the direction that this one did.  Other band documentaries that I've seen concentrate on the band's music and them playing their music.  This one seemed to concentrate on the image of the Sex Pisols and their effect on society at the time.  Of course, that was the basis of the Sex Pisols' noteriety- their effect on culture.  They were the pioneers of punk music and culture, so it was obiously going to go in that direction.
Rock groups have had a huge effect on me and my life, as well as many teenagers, and so it was cool to see how youth were reacting to bands back then.  Music has always had a profound effect on youth culture, and that's made ever apparent in this movie.  Music helps defines who teens and young adults are- it plays a huge role in their character development.  It's crazy and enlightening to see who was influencing some of the people in the older generation.
There was numerous odd aspects about this film however, one being that the manager of the band, when being interviewed, wore a weird rubber suit that kind of freaked me out.  The film being broken up by some old British Shakespearian movie was kind of wierd as well, but it was cool though.
I wish there would have been sub-titles for some of the interviews because some of the interviewees' British accents were too strong to understand what they were saying.  After a while I got used to it, but nonetheless.
I really like learning about bands and their history and effect on the music world or the world in general, and so I obviously liked this movie.  I've seen seriously about 40 VH1 ""Behind the Music""s, and if you're into that type of thing, then this movie is for you.  Overall, I liked it a lot.  Like I said before, it probably would have been more interesting if it went a little more in depth on their history, but that's about the only drawback.  Actually, another drawback was that it showed some nudity toward the begginning.  (...).  If you have the time- go see see this movie- it's two hours well spent.",1007856000,2,2450,4.433035714285714

Many clips from British television , animation and pictures and film footage of the Sex Pistols are used here to tell the story of the birth , rise , and crucifixion of the most notorious rock band in music history. Along with great commentaries by the surviving band members. All of them always , seperately , in silhouette during their commentaries.

You come away with a deeper understanding of the Sex Pistols after watching this DVD. There are insights given here that some fans may not have known about. People saw the band fall apart but this film shows HOW they fell apart and why. They were a band who came out of the dulldrams of British life during the 70's and rose to fame during the birth of punk but in the end of their career may have been exploited as controversial freaks and not a serious band. The band sensed it and broke up. Appropriately , the last song played at their final concert was called ""No Fun"".

You see the punk rock scene in 1970's England , you see the Bill Grundy interview that gave birth to the bands notorious reputation. And you get Jones' and Rotten's take on the Grundy interview as the clip played. You see the band singing ""No Fun"" at their last concert in San Francisco and expressing their feelings and insight toward their demise and their regrets through voice overs during the concert clip. You see the demise of Sid Vicious , the sad picture painted of him and Nancy Spurgen , and you see the chilling interview of Sid that showed the unstable state of mind he was in during his pending trial of Nancy's murder. Johnny Rotten , emotionally , expresses his regrets for not helping Sid more and not preventing his death in some way. It is surprising to hear the emotion from Rotten because he is a guy who you never see express sadness and show tears. Its a rare and real moment captured on tape.

As the film goes along you become more captivated by this unique documentary. It captivates you as it goes along because its very insightful to the feelings of the band members and their manager Malcolm and they're all very giving with their insights and feelings. This is a revealing documentary in its abstract approach to telling the story of the Sex Pistols.

The DVD comes with the widescreen version , feature length commentary by director Julien Temple , a documentary on the punk movement , trailer , and DVD-ROM links to the original theatrical website. This is a must have for Sex Pistol and punk rock fanatics.",1003017600,10,2602,4.494714587737843

1265924,4,B00003CXHM,"Julien Temple's The Filth and the fury is an exciting, punk filled and very interesting film about the Pistols where in which not only do they incorporate footage from they're concerts (much never seen before) and footage from old British TV shows from the mid to late 70's, but also includes the original 4 members of the Pistols (the version before Sid Vicious came in) in silhouette form.  They each bring insight, often touching and cool to many of the Pistols most infamous moments and tragedies (including the British TV show where they were the first to say the f word and footage from they're last painful concert in San Francisco.  Sometimes the film steers of from it's original trajectory, but when it has it's sights set on the Pistols and it's legacy, it shows that it's one of the best rockumentaries in sight.",994550400,,824,4.715277777777778
1265925,3,B00003CXHM,"What is most fascinating about the Sex Pistols is not their meteoric rise to infamy, but the utter implausibility of it.  How two nogoodfernuthins happened to hook up with someone who can actually play and with a provocateur to manage them is already hard enough to swallow.  Add to that their discovery of the charismatic and hyperarticulate Johnny Rotten in a random search for a front-man, and it becomes the proverbial discovery of the proverbial needle in the proverbial haystack.  This documentary, solely from the band's point of view as McLaren was not invited, will captivate any true music fan.  We get to hear about all the juicy stuff firsthand: Their profanity-strewn appearance on a British TV talk show that first gave them their notoriety, A&M wilting under public pressure and dropping them off their roster after signing them less than 24 hours earlier, the infighting between the band-members, the accelerating mutation of punk culture into something even the band did not understand, McLaren's underhanded dealings, Sid Vicious' girlfriend and their destructive habits, etc.  It must've been a wild and chaotic two-year ride for the Pistols and based on the interviews, they appear to be just getting over the shock now.  I think Temple tried to capture some of that woolliness in his approach because this is not your typical talking-heads documentary.  Instead, Temple assaults us with a collage-montage barrage.  I found the technique to be exhausting, and I imagine people uninterested by the subject matter will not have the patience to endure it.  And it's too bad that McLaren wasn't involved in the project because although he would invariably have overestimated his contributions to the Pistols' rapid ascent, it would be interesting to know more about how he pulled the strings behind the scenes.  I also didn't like Temple's approach of shooting the interviews with the band-members backlit.  In fact, I don't know anyone who liked this approach, so I have no idea why the Pistols decided to hide their faces.  Perhaps it's because they wanted to preserve in our minds their images as wild, young punk-avatars, since there was no mention of the Filthy Lucre reunion tour either.",991958400,8,2209,5.105555555555555

1265927,4,B00003CXHM,"Director Julien Temple should have remembered the scene in ""Almost Famous"" when Lester Bangs advises the neophyte rock journalist to ""NEVER make friends with the band!"" Fast forward to the infamous ""crying scene"" in ""Filth And The Fury"", where John Lydon, reminiscing about Sid Vicious, chokes back tears and says ""He's f--- dead, JULIEN..."" Oops...there goes the ""fourth wall""! That said, this is still an entertaining wallow in the late 70's English punk scene in all of its filth and glory. Purists will cringe over the use of crisp studio versions of songs wedded to grainy performance footage, but in a way this spin stays right in line with the whole ""rock 'n' roll swindle"" concept. The film could have explored historical perspective and musical influences a bit more, instead of  ""Malcolm McLaren did this to us, M.M. did that to us""  self-pity for two hours. Reality check, Mr. Lydon: as manipulative and exploitive as the Malcolm McLarens, Col. Parkers and Peter Grants of the world may be, would Johnny Rotten, Elvis Presley or Led Zeppelin have become as famous without them? (That's showbiz!)",988761600,,1106,5.005434782608695
1265928,5,B00003CXHM,"I came of age with the Sex Pistols ( I was 17 in 1977).  I can remember being inspired by their music, but I never got to really know the motivation behind the punk movement.  This documentary clarified it for me.
Certainly I wouldn't want to live the lives of the Sex Pistols...but the extremes of their life were like a never-ending machine gun spray against the plaisanteries that the bourgeois use to lie to themselves and others....how polite gentleman screw over everybody and still remain the ""bedrock of the community"".  SP saw through all of this and offended the status quo with their authentic rage.
Someone comments that the Sex Pistols ended at the right time for all the wrong reasons.  I think that is an apt statement. Noone could carry on that type of intensity for a longer period and it seems as though the group was on the verge of being coopted for a number of reasons....seems like the heroin had a lot to do with this.  Of course, it's also true that consumer society manages to coopt everything....even though SPs rage and nihilism made it really difficult to do.

1266047,5,B00003CXHM,"Just addressing some of the criticisms of this film and adding some analysis of my own...

1) Overdubbed studio tracks over live footage. Would you rather hear the studio version, or hear nothing at all? The footage from which this documentary is culled was hardly organized or cataloged when the Pistols won it in a civil case against Malcolm McLaren. Considering the time period in which it was filmed, it was probably done with separate audio and video equipment. Even if the audio exists, it's probably very faint. Anyway, you do get the blistering version of ""No Fun,"" and the (in-studio, on-off) of ""Road Runner/Johnny B. Goode.""

2) The myth of the Sex Pistols' lack of talent. A myth, and just that. If Malcolm Mclaren wanted to say, with ""Swindle..."" that the Pistols were talentless, then he made a mistake by including their music. The music is still incendiary, and more relevant with every passing year. Try to listen to the aforementioned set of covers without acknowledging how thoroughly the Pistols exploded rock and roll-- turning rock ""standards"" into a glossalalia of destruction.

3) Too sociological in its scope. If you are used to punk as power-pop with bubblegum roots and a cartoon image, then you will probably deny the sociological roots of British punk culture. Watch the film again. The social climate was as relevant to the Sex Pistols as guitar, vox, bass, or drums.

This is, to pay Temple a great compliment, a movie worthy of its subject. While I can't wave the banner of objective truth as the Pistols do in their modern-day interviews-- I wasn't there and ""truth"" is a slippery concept-- ""The Filth and the Fury"" is the kind of documentary that rescues its subjects from the cesspool of myth.

Myth is just gossip grown old.",982540800,9,1761,4.837209302325581
1266048,5,B00003CXHM,"They were never heartthrobs for millions of teenage girls.  They were banned from performing almost anywhere in their country.  Their musicianship could barely be called proficient.  However, for a time, the Sex Pistols were one of the most talked-about and controversial bands in rock history.  And their influence over pop culture during the late seventies, can only be compared to the Beatles' influence in the mid- to late sixties.
""The Filth and the Fury"" is both a document of a great rock band and of a revolutionary time in our modern cultural history.  No one can actually call the Sex Pistols the first punk band (there are arguments for the Damned, Ramones, even MC5 and the Stooges); however, they are, in my opinion, the most important punk band to come down the pike.  Not because they were so controversial but because they made the adult world stand up and take notice what was going on.
Julien Temple's documentary perfectly illustrates the motivations, the main characters, and the happenings of that brief, but momentous, time in history.  It is great to hear and see the band members in their own words (especially some rarely seen interviews with Sid Vicious).  However, it was unfortunate Malcolm McClaren did not and/or would not participate in any interviews; especially because the way is he castigated and vilified by some of the band members.
This film is great viewing for those who lived during and vividly remember these events; and also great viewing for those who consider Blink 182, Green Day, mXpX, etc. great punk bands.",981504000,4,1555,4.953846153846154

All surviving band memebers are interviewed with there faces blackened out as Temple takes the viewer through 1977 London, which at the time was a chaotic state. Through the squaller of London the Sex Pistols were born. Johnny Rotten is his usual brilliantly hilarious self as he corrects all the lies that were set forth mainly by Malcolm McLaren. Lots of footage shows the band on stage as well as in the streets. You get a clear picture on how pathetic a junkies life is in seeing Sid Vicious literally waste away right in front of you. Really sad. Lots of great moments for the band are in here as well. Like the Grundy interview and the Queens Jubilee boat ride. A definte must own for any Pistols fan.

It captured all the strife and turmoil within the band very well, with interviews of the band members that showed how each member really felt. The movie showed the Sex Pistols rise and the Sex Pistols fall, which was brought on by their manager and their disastrous U.S. tour. Anyway, the movie was definately entertaining and the concert footage was great. The movie told the real story of the Sex Pistols well and showed what a crook Malcolm McLaren(their manager) really was. It showed how the Sex Pistols were destroyed by greed and the very things that they were rebelling against. A must see for any rock fan!",980553600,,678,4.705882352941177

I can say this is a touching, hilarious, inspiring, fascinating film about some very young men, their music, their fashion and the social upheaval they caused just by saying what they believed.
Julien Temple does a great job with the movie itself, giving the Pistols a strong sense of context for the American viewer, but his commentary on the DVD leaves something to be desired.  Someone should have told him that this isn't an interview, but a chance for him to comment on the images in front of him.",979516800,2,733,4.587786259541985
1266052,4,B00003CXHM,"Far superior to ""The Great Rock & Roll Swindle,"" ""The Filth and the Fury"" is a well-rounded, honest look at the history and aftermath of the most influential rock band of the last quarter of the twentieth century. (Will they be making documentaries about N'Sync or Kid Rock or Eminem or Creed in 25 years? Please. I somehow doubt it.) This documentary isn't afraid to be honest, and the result is the utter humanization of a very misunderstood band. Johnny Rotten even sheds tears over the tragic waste that was his friend, Sid Vicious, and he is touching with his sentiment and candor.
This movie is always fun, and it certainly provokes nostalgia for anyone who grew up as a punk while educating those who kept their distance.

1266053,5,B00003CXHM,"this film shows exactly why the sex pistols were and still are one of the scariest, yet smartest, bands to ever exist. rare film footage shows them performing for audiences that at times do not know what to do to this new music called punk, other times they begin the punk protocol of slam dancing, spitting, etc. john lydon, mr. rotten to you, is the voice most heard here, and he tells things the way they really were (does he know any other way? hell no), and his candor is refreshing: genuine passion for an art form that he helped create, and genuine disgust for the movement of punk (stating that when the rich kids started punk fashion it began to die, since punk was never a 'fashion' but a statement and a style). he also surprised me by showing real emotion for john ritchie, the bass player known to all of us as sid vicious. the perpetually strung-out, image conscious, there-for-the-ride, clueless bass player still strikes a chord in lydon's heart, and i could swear i hear a tear from lydon. the tensions within the band are also documented very well: were they malcolm mclaren's trained seals or a genuine rock band? towards the end you can tell that lydon, in film clips and recent interview, feels they were there for the delight of mclaren's ego, nothing more. 'exist to strike controversy, nothing more'. lydon is too smart for that junk, and it's fitting that the final clip of the movie is him telling a san francisco audience 'ever have the feeling you've been cheated?' after singing 'no fun' for 15 minutes, then walking off in disgust . apparently lydon did. but watching this will leave you exhilarated, making you realize that all the 'punk' bands out there now are really as dangerous as britney spears. it's all cookie-cutter now; looking at this film will make you realize that the myth and legend behind this band is the real deal.",978393600,9,1863,4.6314199395770395

A must for any devotee of the band.  The movie contains incredible live performance footage and fascinating interviews with the surviving members of the band.  John Lydon emerges as an erudite, sensitive, creative, and deep thinking punk rock pioneer, but above all a sincerely motivated social critic.  Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen in the flesh here have the effect of rendering the Alex Cox's ""Sid and Nancy"" obsolete.

The movie is appropriately full of ""punk"" flourishes like this one, most notably the seemingly randomly inserted clips of newscasts, sitcoms, standup comedy routines and old interviews. My favorite clips are the ones from Laurence Olivier's Richard III for how they serve as a metaphor for band's rise and fall. Even if you're not interested in the Sex Pistols or already know everything there is to know about them, it's still worth watching as a punk history lesson. It's essential viewing if all you know about the Sex Pistols is from watching Sid and Nancy because it gives a much fairer, honest, and deromanticized - not to mention horrifying and heartbreaking - account of that doomed affair.",1525305600,,1125,5.053763440860215
