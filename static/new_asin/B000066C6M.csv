7966562,3,B000066C6M,"This release by Brooklyn Zoo has two films on the disc.  The first is Miltant Eagle, and the second is Fistful of Talons.  Both are fair Kung Fu films, but you won't find anything spectacular about them. Both are English dubbed.  No subtitle fearture.
The first, Militant Eagle, is of poorer visual quaility.  It appears to have been copied from a VHS edition where the tracking was off for half the film. There are several well choeregraphed fight scenes however, including the ending where seveal of the heros are pitted against the villains simutaneoulsy.  Even a group of kids get into the fight with there sling shots.  Overall I'd give the first film a 3 due to the video quality.
The second feature, Fistful of Talons, is of better quality visually.  Billy Chong plays a cocky guy who gets involved in throwing down a small movement by the Chings to restore the CHing dynasty.  Along the way he meets up with Miss Ma, an enthusist and keeper of eagles.  After backing out of a marriage arrangement with her, she tracks him down with her loyal eagles.  Lucky for him she does, because the eagles play a vital role in saving his life in the last fight.  Yeah that's right, these eagles seem to know some kung fu.  You'll just have to watch to see what I'm talking about.  Miss Ma dosn't use much kung fu, she's in mainly for an excuse to have a cute girl in the film.
I prefered Fistful of Talons, and would give it a 3 1/2 rating. But for the price, it's worth getting this DOuble feature disc.  Even if your turned off by the picture quality in Miltant Eagle, Fistful of Talons is worth the price.",1032998400,,1604,4.448630136986301
