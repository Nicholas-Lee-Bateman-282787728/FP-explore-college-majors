8164191,1,B000LU6YLS,"This has got to be the worst video ever. Nothing was professional, the workout was very poor. Under no circumstance should you buy this video unless you like the cover or need a coaster for your table...",1341273600,,203,4.513513513513513
8164192,1,B000LU6YLS,"I was very, very disappointed by this video. The cover is about the only professional thing about this production, and I guess it fooled me. It was hilariously obvious that the ""teachers"" were reading a script (their eyes went back and forth and they stumbled over words). While they might be very knowledgeable people, the overall effect was that they had very little idea what they were talking about.  Also, it is doubtful that you would want to watch this video more than once (if that) as there is so much repetitive talking and no way to just jump to the exercise portions of each segment. The movement exercises themselves were weak and ineffective. Do not waste your money.",1226534400,3,681,4.722689075630252
8164193,5,B000LU6YLS,"Excellent and challenging workout for any kind of dancer, but especially good for belly dance which requires a strong core.  If you do this workout regularly you will have fabulous abs!  The DVD has four parts: 1. A very thorough core conditioning workout with pilates style exercises done with weighted balls, a resistance band and no equipment; 2. A short 4 minute workout on rotational discs set to Latin music focusing on the waist; 3. A very detailed animated tension release segment designed to lengthen and release tightness in muscles (with targeted stretching, etc.); and 4. A bonus Middle Eastern dance by Amaya.",1174521600,6,622,5.029126213592233
