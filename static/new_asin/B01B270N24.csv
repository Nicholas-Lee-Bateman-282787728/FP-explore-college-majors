7616859,5,B01B270N24,"Loretta Lynn, one of the most famous female country singers in the world. Born in Butcher Holler, Tennessee, married at15, had six children, and became famous world wide.

Loretta had a rough life, lots of love, enough found, but that was it. Married young to Dolittle, who loved her, but he was a back country boy with little education. However, he knew Loretta had talent, and he pushed her and the music producers. Her early music was someone else's , and she did not do well with them. She started writing songs. Her first well known song, 'Honky Tonk Girl', and it is still memorable today. At the beginning if their marriage she and do moved to Bellingham, Washington. It was here her music started, and they visited every radio station across the US. Loretta made herself a name, and Do helped to make her famous. She was frequently confused with Kitty Wells, and she needed to find her own style.

Her daughter says Loretta has the Kentucky twang with the West Coast beat, that is the sound that made her famous. She hooked up with other singers and they traveled across the country. Every year, she became more well known. 'Coal Miner's Daughter' may be her most famous, then, 'Don't Come Home ADrinkin With Lovin On Your Mind'. Real life songs that everyone could identify. A beautiful country voice, fame and fortune, and Loretta stuck by her man. Dolittle was her only husband, and she loved him. Her children are still her loves.

Patsy Cline became a great friend, and helped her with her stage presence and other style issues. She became a member of The Grand Old Opry, and a star was born. This was such a beautiful film, filled with the love and life of Loretta Lynn.

7616898,5,B01B270N24,This is a very informative DVD on the first lady of country music. Loretta has had good and bad times in her life just like all of us but her faith in God has helped her. She is no different from anyone else other that she is a music icon but she seems so down to earth just listing to her talk and she is open 100% about herself. Loretta's family is no different and I also enjoy hearing other artist talk about Loretta and these people are also her friends. This has to be the best documentary that has ever been done on Loretta. Purchase Still A Mountain Girl and you will be glad you did also her album Full Circle should be part of the purchase as it would be a wonderful addition.,1464393600,4,686,4.088888888888889

7616917,5,B01B270N24,"Jack White, of the White Stripes fame, has much to say in this documentary concerning his awe about his personal friend Loretta Lynns talent and her more than unique lyrics. They are like no other as they appear to be sung almost as if they are written backward to come around a full circle while he asks, Is this the chorus or the verse? - While collaborating as a musician and producer on her 2005 Grammy winning album, Van Lear Rose. Like her songs, Loretta is a true original. Perhaps you may recall the 1980 movie starring Sissy Spacek (who also adds so much commentary within) and Tommy Lee Jones which shows the escalation of her life from its extremely humble beginnings to superstardom. Coal Miners Daughter took home the coveted 1981 Academy Awards for Best Actress, Best Picture, Screenplay, and Cinematography. It is true that Miss Loretta Lynns life is full of firsts and accomplishments from the little girl from Butcher Holler, Kentucky. This humble beginning brought out one woman with gumption and' spitfire.

In this wonderfully musical documentary and also the story of her life, directed by Vikram Jayanti, we discover that Loretta Lynn worked her way up from the bottom and is more focused on talking about where she came from, how her family life went and who she is now. She is Still a Mountain Girl and this aptly proves this while we learn how she influenced the progression of country music especially for women as she speaks openly about her life. She has even been designated as the Female Hank Williams as far as Lynns ability in lyrical storytelling. We learn so much about her marriage to Doolittle, which was the inspiration for many of her songs. Her children and her grandchildren include just how ordinary she thinks herself to be. The vocalists who speak about her discography are a long and winding road of whos who of musicians from Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, and Reba McEntire I could go on forever listing all of the people she has influenced and they do appear within. This documentary is more personal and involves so many golden moments of her childrens recollections of their parents marriage, but mainly of their lovely and never to be overshadowed mother in a more family type story.

Loretta married Oliver Doolittle Lynn at the tender age of thirteen, as she says, who moved them from Butcher Holler to the state of Washington. Feeling lonely for her Appalachian Mountain home, she says she actually owes so much to being angry with her husband Doo. She recalled everything concerning their spats, his drinking, and hard living  then she wrote and sang about it to forget any of its hurt or its importance. She kept up with the times while having so many children and touring, being a good wife, and domestic pulls on her made the idea of these many songs about her life an easy solution. Her partnering with Conway Twitty is looked at and heard along with so many archival clips that I hadnt seen before of a performer who was anything but fearful. Her relationship with Patsy Cline is brought to the forefront and how she helped Loretta with the outfits for being onstage. Being great friends, Loretta named one of her twin girls, Patsy, after Cline. I laughed at many of the instances that did not go Doos way as told by their son and how Loretta fought back with whatever was dished out. She is no shrinking violet and her children will back up this statement within.

Loretta Lynn has won four Grammys, the Kennedy Center Honors and the Presidential Medal of Freedom amongst other awards and honors. Remaining one of a kind while selling over 45 million records and also completely down home, she has been inducted into more Music Halls of Fame than any other female singing sensation to this very date. What really stands out about Miss Lynn is not all of the awards, but the humor and love that exude from her towards everyone and how her family feels about her. She is completely one of a kind - Miss Loretta Lynn",1459296000,7,3970,4.6833810888252145
