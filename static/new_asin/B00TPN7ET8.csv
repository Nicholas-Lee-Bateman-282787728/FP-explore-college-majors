7015358,5,B00TPN7ET8,"I love film noir movies, especially a Bogart or a Cagney film!  When movies were made in an era when Men and Women REALLY acted!!!  It's nice to see movies with class and character instead of sex, nudity, blood and gore!",1443744000,15,220,4.341463414634147

7015362,5,B00TPN7ET8,One of my favorite Bogart movies beautifully remastered,1433808000,,55,6.0
7015363,4,B00TPN7ET8,"Thank You Warner Archive for the quick release of this Warner forgotten classic from the Bogart filmography,I requested this be released only 6 months prior to the march 2015 release. This is vintage Bogie tough guy persona as only He could do it. As usual it's not about the story which is  just ok,it's about the charismatic Bogart chemistry and interaction with his co-stars. If your a diehard Bogie fan,this is a must see.",1432512000,8,426,4.756756756756757

7015365,5,B00TPN7ET8,"Not necessarily a rating of the movie, which I'd give 3.5 stars.  What I like a LOT is that with the Warner Archive series you can now watch films from great actors like Bogie that were previously unavailable on DVD.",1430352000,7,216,4.4

7015384,5,B00TPN7ET8,Great DVD,1461456000,,9,4.0
7015385,3,B00TPN7ET8,"Bogart plays a guy trying to go straight but of course, things don't turn out quite right.  This movie would be 4 stars except for a foolish decision by the director.  He showed the ending at the beginning and then the rest of the movie was all a flashback.  But by that the decision, the film lost all its suspense.  My recommendation... watch this film but skip the first three minutes.  Then watch it at the end.  You'll thank me.",1460851200,14,433,4.35

8702570,5,B00TPN7ET8,Bogart at his gangster best. It has been said that nobody dies like Humphrey Bogart.  A great death finale.,1510963200,,107,4.631578947368421

8702574,5,B00TPN7ET8,"I bought this to see the vivacious and tragic Susan Peters, and also because I like Humphrey Bogart as a crook (or at least as a creepy little guy) much better than I like him as a hero; he is great in this. Susan is disappointing. And the movie is appropriately devastating. Its reputation is not so hot, but maybe it deserves a reevaluation.",1479945600,,343,4.375
