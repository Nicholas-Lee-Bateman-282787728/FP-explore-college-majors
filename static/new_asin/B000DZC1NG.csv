8102955,5,B000DZC1NG,"I got this film on the recommendation of my Polish friend, who remembered it fondly from her childhood.  It was just as advertised: slapstick mixed within an historical zeitgeist of the movement of the Poles from one home to another after the war. This film, the first of what eventually became a trilogy, focuses on the feud between two neighboring families.

Of course, in the best ""Romeo and Juliet"" tradition, the son and daughter of the families fall in love and this relationship has the power to either escalate the latent violence or mend the fences (literally: the family build a fence between their properties, then cross it, strengthen it, weaken it, etc.

It is a fun movie, but be warned: I watch this and many European films on my computer, as the region is not USA.",1392249600,,780,4.678832116788321

This movie will be a Criterion release someday.
I also recommend  the firemans ball a movie from the same time period (Czech) both movies are about life not politics.",1390262400,,211,4.552631578947368

8102958,5,B000DZC1NG,"If you understand Polish, you will love this comedy, at times hard to understand but once you ""get it"" its very funny. Its kind of like an American watching a british comedy, they speak differently, but once you ""get it"" its funny.  Same with this, because they speak with a ""gwara"" --dialect.",1186185600,8,293,4.634615384615385
