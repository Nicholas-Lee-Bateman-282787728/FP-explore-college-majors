8112094,4,B000EOTU08,The storyline was great the characters were great. And also the deaths were nice. There was some points that seemed lesbian but they weren't to heavy. The movie started out pretty nicely honestly and had a good ending too. The main actress who played tomie was beautiful and very conviencing. A must buy,1480377600,,303,4.735849056603773
8112095,4,B000EOTU08,"This was what I have been waiting for!
To see Tomie's origins!

It was a very good movie. The acting was amature and the movie, low budget, but it really adds in some information for us Tomie fans. The Tomie actress in this movie was adorable. The plot was great and it wasn't necessarily a scary horror film, just good.

I'd suggest anyone who read the Tomie manga see this movie as well.
:D A great addition to your collection!",1240099200,,429,4.35
8112096,3,B000EOTU08,I liked how the actress played Tomie in this prequel. She was cute and scary at the same time.,1232236800,,94,4.0
8112097,5,B000EOTU08,"Another great movie to add to the ""Tomie collection"".
This movie takes place right before the first Tomie movie started, Basically a prequel.
Tomie arrives as a transfer student from another school, and one by one begins to terrorize and hypnotize her teacher and classmates with her good looks and evil ways...
I wish that they would keep the movie series going. I remember hearing in the movie that investigators said the Tomie murders dated back to another era in japan. This would/and still could be a great storyline and area to start off with, Unfortunatly they chose not to.",1189382400,,581,4.82
