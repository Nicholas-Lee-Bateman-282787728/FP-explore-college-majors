779265,5,6304107439,"When I was little, the Faerie Tale Theatre videos were my favorite, and my favorite of them was always the 3 Little Pigs. It was just so funny, the most comical of all the videos. When you put together Jeff Goldblum, Billy Crystal, and Fred Willard, though, you're bound to get a stroke of genius.

 We all know the story, but now each pig has a name and personality: Peter (Stephen Furst, aka Flounder of Animal House), the greedy one who builds a straw house because it's cheapest; Paul (Willard, making his mark in Christopher Guest movies and others), the ladies man (or tries to be) pig who builds the stick house because it's strong and, I quote, 'ladies love wood.'; and Larry (Crystal...well, you know who he is), the runt of the litter and the sweet one who builds the brick house because he's, well, smart and a hard worker. Then there's Buck Wolf (Goldblum, who'd be unrecognizable if it weren't for his distinct voice), the beer-drinking, unhappily-married wolf who's forced by his nagging, unseen wife Nadine to get a pig for when their friends the Coyotes come over. So he heads out, harassing Burt Man (Larry Hankin, aka Mr. Heckles on Friends), who sold the pigs their supplies, and failing until he's defeated by the three pigs and their new gal Tina (Valerie Perrine), who appears to love everything, especially the name Buck, bricks, the oboe, and the list goes on.

 The Three Little Pigs still makes me laugh today (and I'm a junior in high school) because it has jokes I notice now, or ones I still find funny. So for a tale truly for all ages, you gotta see this version of the 3 Little Pigs. If you don't, I'll come back here and I'll chew on your face.",1134518400,4,1677,4.524752475247524

779267,5,6304107439,"I was kind of skeptical of this movie at first, but am so glad that we bought this dvd. The entire family has enjoyed watching it, from our 3 year old to the adults. It follows the traditional story enough for the kids, but is also different and sophisticated enough to keep the grown-ups entertained as well. For the younger children, you may want to be a little wary of some of the dialogue. There's nothing at all inappropriate about it, but our 3 year old loves to quote the Big Bad Wolf and tell people that he's going to come back and ""chew on their face."" Like I said, nothing really bad, but does sometimes get him in trouble at preschool (lol). Overall, a wonderful movie at a great price. We also have Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and plan to buy several more of the Faerie Tale Theatre dvds.",1115856000,7,805,4.337748344370861

Larry (Billy Crystal) and his two brothers leave home to find their way in the world. Whilst his two brothers (Willard and Furst) carelessly squander their savings and build flimsy houses of sticks and straw, Larry wisely builds his house of bricks...which proves to be an extremely wise move when a Wolf with an attitude problem (Jeff Goldblum) goes a-hunting for bacon...

Will Larry be able to stand up to the Wolf and win the affections of feisty piglette Tina (Valerie Perrine)? Wait and see! THE THREE LITTLE PIGS is one of the best in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series.",1098662400,14,844,5.021428571428571

Billy Crystal as well as his on-screen brother actors are excellent as the three pigs, and Jeff Goldblum is show-stealing as the Big Bad Wolf.

How he didn't win an oscar is beyond me.  Valerie Perrine rocks as Tina, the sexy hog.  All in all, a perfect directing job.

7861562,4,6304107439,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

Faerie Tale Theatre's ""The Three Little Pigs"" is one of the best entries in the series, deftly retaining the essential simplicity of the story while adding very well-done humor, mostly courtesy of its wolf villain.

Starring Billy Crystal, Doris Roberts, and Jeff Goldblum as the aforementioned wolf, the story moves very briskly.  The screenplay does boast the trademark wit of Faerie Tale Theatre all around, though Mr. Goldblum(""Jurassic Park"", ""Independence Day"")does get the majority of the humorous one-liners.  If there is any single major criticism I have, it's that the jazzy score for the wolf combined with Goldblum's wonderful dry comedic delivery may drown out the best efforts of the other performers in the production.  Billy Crystal is a great casting choice as the practical, sensible pig who builds the brick house and Doris Roberts of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" gives a memorable, if brief, performance as the mother pig.

Also starring Valerie Perrine, Stephen Furst, and Fred Willard, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""The Three Little Pigs"" is solidly entertaining.",1267920000,,1092,5.394117647058824
7861563,5,6304107439,"This classic fairy-tail is my childhood favorite. Many wonderful characters that will be with me forever. When I was younger this video was the first thing my brother and I would watch while visiting our grandmother. I recently purchased this DVD and it was a wonderful memory my brother and I shared once again, I highly recommend this movie.",1247097600,,343,4.830508474576271
7861564,2,6304107439,"I ordered this movie because I was having my 7th graders write a compare/contrast paper about two different versions of ""The Three Little Pigs"" and I was going to use this movie as part of a closure activity.

When I previewed the movie at home, it seemed very dated, and not really funny at all. The dialog was so stilted that it came off as cheesy. The only character who had any vivid presence was Jeff Goldblum's wolf. Even Billy Crystal, who I usually love, couldn't make it work.

This production might work younger kids at home, but I wouldn't recommend it for a classroom.",1226966400,,580,4.514285714285714
