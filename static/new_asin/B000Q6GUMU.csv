8592202,5,B000Q6GUMU,"Muy recomendable.
Los 4 DVD'S que lo forman son muy provechosos, siendo de un nivel intermedio/avanzado.
El trabajo abdominal en los 4 es muy importante.",1185494400,2,153,5.16
8592203,1,B000Q6GUMU,"I took a chance ordering these from an unknown trainer with no reviews.  Save your money.  These DVD's are actually DVD-R's.  DVD'R's tend to degrade over time.  I got some from another instructor and they played well for the first six months and then I started having problems with them and eventually they wouldn't play.  This listing should clearly state that these are DVD-r's so the buyer can beware!

I'm sure CarolAnn is a nice person but these look very low bugdet and amaturish.  With all the quality workouts on the market today I would recommend spending your dollars elsewhere.",1182643200,6,589,4.83
