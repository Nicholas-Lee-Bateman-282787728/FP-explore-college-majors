2777127,5,B000NP8TG4,"Sound was very good as well as picture - price was low and shipping was very quick. DVD arrived in perfect brand new shape.

Song and artist selection was right up my alley as the late 1970's was my time! I particularly enjoyed Blondie (One way or Another), Commodores (Three Times A Lady), Gloria Gaynor (I Will Survive - this was my mother-in-laws song when she had breast cancer!), Dolly Parton (I Will Always Love You - my favorite Dolly song!), and The Charlie Daniels Band (The Devil Went Down To Georgia).

I love the Beach Boys but their performance was kind of disappointing.

I would rate this a pretty good 8.50 to 9.0 out of 10 - highly recommended!",1409788800,,661,4.491666666666666

Andy Kaufman-runs 3m and i rate him-good. Ventriloquism,Little Red Riding Hood and Howdy Doody?

Robert Klein-runs 6m and i rate him-also good. Dentistry

Highlites:I felt compelled to go artist by artist on this volume.

Blondie/One Way Or Another-1 Hot Chick to look at-also 1 Lightning-Fast Drummer-Clement Burke,So-so rating for this.

Journey/Lovin',Touchin',Squeezin'-Excellent clip,but no City of The Angels shown,and that's too bad,one great song they should have included it.

Commodores/Three Times A Lady-Excellent clip-had the women in the audience pretty much hypnotized,also a good drummer.

The Cars/Let's Go-Seen Better,disappointed,also maybe Lip-Sync from Ben?

The Babys/Everytime I Think of You-Tame,So-so for this.

The Beach Boys/Good Vibrations-Have Seen Better-Dennis on Drums looking kind of scruffy and bored.

Gloria Gaynor/I Will Survive-Cute!

Nick Gilder/Hot Child In The City-Excellent clip!

Rick James/You And I-Good Beat.

Dolly Parton/I Will Alway's Love You-Great Song!

Amii Stewart/Knock On Wood-Reminded me of something i would see on an Alice Cooper music set,Good Song but not good live.

The Pointer Sisters/Fire-Excellent clip.

The Charlie Daniels Band/The Devil Went Down To Georgia-Good clip not the best,and when Charlie says son of a bitch,the word bitch is bleeped-out.

Peaches & Herb/Reunited-YES!!! Perfect Team Work.

Rupert Holmes/Escape-Not Too Bad.

I would get this dvd,because of Blondie,Journey,Commodores,Nick Gilder,Dolly Parton,Pointer Sisters,and especially for Peaches & Herb.",1370995200,2,1710,5.962962962962963

Granted they could edit the commercials. These dvds show the performances which you can see online. Granted it's good to see the performances they have,  which is why I'm giving it 1star. It's a ripoff to me because I wanted to see the entire show. My advice is to save your money.",1420156800,,447,4.385542168674699
