2200076,5,B00074OLQS,"The *theme song* isn't as catchy as it used to be (they changed a few of the words and slowed it down) and are only 1/2 hour long, per volume, but other than that the new videos are every bit as good as the first three... and the other songs are all wonderful.

They've added a cartoon character named Froggy, who acts a lot like the puppets in ""Baby Einstein"", introducing each new theme.

The new songs won't let those of you down who enjoyed volumes 1-3, and she covers several words in volume 4 such as:  ""Grandma, Grandpa, Cousin, Aunt, house, home, outside, tree, grass, leaf, clouds, rain, snow, hat, coat, boots, gloves, grumpy, excited, surprised, afraid, love (and the compound sign ""ILY"")... and those are just the words I remember.

Rachel's wearing colored paint (latex?) on her hands, which is a bit distracting, but I think the idea was so that the children would be able to tell which fingers she was using.

My three year old is trying to sing one of her new songs even as I type this.  LOL  I should mention he's speech delayed, and Signing Time has been very instrumental to his language skills.  The songs, the children in the videos, and the bright colors all draw him in and get him excited enough to want to share what he's seeing.  Getting him to *want* to talk is half the battle, and signing time makes it easy.",1103414400,20,1337,4.44672131147541

2200094,5,B00074OLQS,"Great DVD's all around. My 16 month old boy learned how to sign ""baby"" and ""time"" the first day he saw one of these videos, and asks for them all the time. He is now 18mo old and knows 30 signs! These videos are amazing. We have 5, and also borrow what we don't have from the local library. Your library will order them for you if they don't have them already. I bought them because my son wants them so often I didn't ever want to be without! Our favorite id the very first one, which is pink with a little blond baby girl on the cover because my kids love the ""pets I love"" song as well as the ""Mom has a Mom"" song. We sing them all the time! My 4yr old daughter likes them as much as my son, and she loves teaching other extended family members and friends the signs she and her brother know.
My son had a tracheostomy right after birth, and a cleft palate so he is speech delayed. These videos helped SOOO much with his frustrations with communication. The speech therapist is very impressed with all of the signs he knows! She said he knows more signs than a typically 18mo old knows actual words for.

My daughter has been watching these DVDs since 12 months and has gone from a few words to over 250 words in her vocabulary. She will use the sign for a few days and then will use the word. I think we've avoided so many tantrums because she can communicate her needs, wants and feelings. Also, signing helps babies make different connections in their brains. It helps them put a sign to an object and give it meaning. Then it's easier to give a word meaning when visuals are available.",1404604800,,587,4.444444444444445

My older children still will watch along YEARS after they are beyond the target audience.  (And, all of my children have actually learned sign language!!!)  I think it is important to realize that these videos aren't just for parents who want to have super babies who learn to sign at an early age.  We actually got these for my oldest who had such delayed speech that everyone was concerned.  No babbling at all.  Within a month or so while sitting in my lap she signed ""lettuce"".  I was eating a salad at the time.  ""Milk"", ""Juice"" and ""More"" were other early signs that relieved our worries just a bit.  Speech started not soon after and to our surprise and delight a little chatterbox emerged and her speech caught up and went beyond where it should have been for her age.  I can't help but credit the videos, because they seemed to draw her out.  To my surprise thought, they also have help make all of my children early readers.  They see the words, sign the words and learn to READ the words.  I highly recommend!",1336348800,,1176,4.429906542056075

We signed with our son when he was a toddler, but the DVD's have been great to reinforce signs for him.  Our daughter learns and uses more and more signs daily.  The Signing Time DVD's have made such a positive difference in her ability to communicate and be understood...she currently uses 40-50 signs consistently!  The Family, Feelings, and Fun DVD is my favorite ST DVD because of the signs it introduces (family, house, home, mom, dad, brother, sister, son, daughter, cousins, aunt, uncle, grumpy, scared, sad, silly, etc.).

We have a few of these videos and I would have to say that so far, volume 3 is my favorite- and my kids' favorite.  Volume 4- Family, Feelings & Fun is jazzed up a bit from the earlier ones- and has some nice additional touches.  And it was definitely nice to add the ""family"" signs to our growing sign vocabulary.

My youngest son has some devt'l delays; he is 2y old and non-verbal.  He is amused but has not picked up any of the signs from the video.  The value has been in us (the rest of his family- siblings and parents) learning these signs and using them with him in our day to day interactions.",1168819200,,934,4.421052631578948

2200148,5,B00074OLQS,"My son was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Delay- Not otherwise specified when he was about two.  We were in North Carolia at the time and were referred to TEEACH.  It is a wonderful organization.  They encouraged us to use visual schedules with him.  That didn't really work for us, for many reasons.

Anyway, we invested in Signing time and he and his little brother love the DVDs!  Aidan is now three and a half and knows about a hundred signs give or take some and his alphabet.  He is talking more and when we don't understand  we ask him to sign and many times he can communicate that way.

I think it is wonderful for everyone to know sign language.  You never know when you might need it!  You'll fall in love with Rachel and Leah and Alex.  Great show!",1168300800,2,768,4.4071428571428575

2200150,4,B00074OLQS,I own the first four volumes of this series and feel that they are excellent resources for teaching young children to communicate effectively.  My four-year old niece viewed them once and was using the signs very well within minutes.  Reinforcement by other family members kept her using the signs for the full two weeks of her visit and she was teaching her toddler brother to sign as well.  My infant granddaughters who are seven and eight months old watched the videos and seemed to be fascinated by the small children on the DVD and the bright colors and music.  This series is great for parents and children and makes learning ASL fun.  I am planning on purchasing the whole series.,1153785600,5,687,4.691666666666666

This is by far the best series out there.  Most other products are so boring that parents must struggle to stay awake during the production, and there is no way a toddler would tolerate a viewing.  My 2-year-old twins request Signing Time all of the time.  At home they want the DVDs playing almost constantly.  In the car my hearing daughter starts asking for the Signing Time CD before I even have her strapped into her carseat.  My 2-year-old deaf daughter is using 5-sign sentences, which is almost unheard of for the deaf child of hearing parents.  My extended family owns a total of 6 sets of Signing Time.  Whenever my daughters' cousins have a birthday they ask for the latest Signing Time DVDs.  Children of all ages love this product.",1148860800,5,885,4.585987261146497

2200156,5,B00074OLQS,"Rachel has such a way of teaching kids to sign and have fun the whole time. There have been signs I've been working with my son for a few years that he showed little interest in. Until we got this volume and suddenly, he started signing them enthusiastically! As with the previous volumes of Signing Time, William (4) quickly learned all the signs in it. He loves singing and signing along with Rachel, Alex and Leah.

I know some parents are concerned that signing might impede their child's speech development, but we have found just the opposite here. William has Trisomy 21/aka Down syndrome and apraxia. Signing Time has helped him with Total Communication~ when his speech hasn't been clear, the signing helps him refine the word. I've found that as he watches Signing Time and the repetition of each new word introduced, William is more apt to repeat the word with greater clarity each time. He loves to go around labeling things he's learned from the videos, and then he wants to know more, more more!

This is another must-have for a video library!",1111968000,16,1057,4.708108108108108

I had downloaded ""Beautiful Day"" from the signingtime.com website before the DVD's were released and my son went CRAZY for it!  I LOVE the song.  It's so poppy and happy.  Besides the ""LMNO"" song from the Vol. 5 ABC Signs, it's my favorite!

We love these videos. My children are both hearing and have been watching them since my first daughter was 6 mths, she is now 2 years. She has many signs under her belt and loves watching Alex and Leah and learning more. These have given her a hunger to learn more. This Video is one of our faves and we love the music and songs that accompany these videos. They are pleaseing to the eye, not only for Children but for adults also. we never get tired of watching them. I have always had a desire to learn sign language and these videos have promoted it in such a way that even I ahve a hunger for more. Rachel Coleman the producer has done an excellent job in helping to reinforce the words not only in sign but also in written form and also in audio form throughout the video, so my child has not only learnt signs but also new words as her vocabulary expands.

I teach infant sign language so my children know a lot of signs, but since we've got the new Signing Time DVDs their signing skills have picked up so much!

If you've been bored or unimpressed by ASL videos in the past, Signing Time will be a refreshing change. It has engaging music and entertaining characters. The signs are presented in a way that makes them easy for adults and kids--even very young kids--to learn!

Well, after watching the videos for 1 week, she had picked up 15 signs with the clear spoken word to match! by the end of 5 weeks, she could speak and sign all 100 or so signs from the set! (I also have a 4 1/2 yr old who has also improved with these videos. Plus, my 7 month old daughter is often enthralled with them. She recognizes the sign for ""milk"" and gets excited when we sign it!)

My husband is Deaf, so we do use sign at home, but she refused to pick up EITHER language. These videos provided a way for her to communicate! Now she is picking up the signs/words from Vol 4-6 just as quickly, and she is stringing words and signs together.

We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]

In Volume 4 the songs are lots of fun and work well in a school setting as well as home. The song ""What are you feeling?"" shows signs for emotions. It is funny to see the kids sign scared and make scared faces. These signs are very helpful for getting children to tell you how they feel. The song about families is great because it talks about how everyone's family is different. ""Your family's made for you and mine is made for me.""

We love that we get to hear Leah's voice. What a positive experience for children who are Deaf and Hard Of Hearing to see another Child who is Deaf proudly using their voice. Leah does a great job. It is also great for children who are hearing to see that children who are Deaf can and do use their voices. Alex does a great job as well. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together. We also enjoyed the addition of the frog Hopkins. He helps transition from one theme to another smoothly.

One minor thing about this Volume that bothered us is that when Alex And Leah talk about their families the pictures are not of their actual families. Rachel explains the reasons for this on their yahoo site. If you are not familiar with The Coleman and Brown families you won't even notice but if you know Alex and Leah's siblings from other volumes of Signing Time you might be confused. This in no way detracts from the value of this volume. The only reason I mention it is because my kids were wondering why Lucy and Zack were not in the family picture and your kids may ask you too.

We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it. She has paint on her fingers to help you focus on her finger positions. This is a new addition for Volumes 3-6. Some people find it distracting at first but I found it very helpful.

The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention. The new version of the theme song is a little slower (so you can sign along) and has an additional verse. Some may not like it as well as the original but we loved it. We love the original version too so make sure you get both. The older version is in Volumes 1-3. We liked the new verse ""Where friends can meet and find we're not so different after all"" Isn't that what Signing Time is all about?

I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation.
