8745110,3,B019GFP0Z4,"Cute. Benoit can take half decent material and make into a light, sweet, entertaining time. It passes the time nicely.  And not his best; so keep watching more of his works.",1506038400,,173,4.580645161290323
8745111,4,B019GFP0Z4,"Ok, so God lives with wife and daughter and Jesus who by this time has been converted into not much more than a mantelpiece icon.  The world itself seems to be some sort of sim city in which nothing offered goes exactly perfectly.
Unfortunately the daughter is in those tenacious youthful times where she just doesn't appreciate dad's offbeat sense of humor.  She decides to interfere by escaping into this virtual world to throw all flawed plans amuck.  And God is forced to follow into the offbeat, flawed world which he has created.
It's an amusing idea, I'm not certain if it's quite as funny as one might expect.  But it's definitely worth a spin.",1480723200,,652,4.643478260869565

8745114,2,B019GFP0Z4,"It did not say anywhere but there are no english subtitles.  Sounds like a great movie but if you need subtitles for French, it is not for you.",1471824000,,143,4.107142857142857
8745115,1,B019GFP0Z4,"Very Disappointed. I purchased this, as I had missed the movie during the Seattle International Film Festival. As soon as it arrived, I popped it into my DVD player. Hmm... no subtitles. No main menu. Unfortunately, it's been some time since I've purchased it. So, I'll strike it up as a loss. However, I hope I have prevented anyone else from making the same mistake.",1471392000,11,368,4.676923076923077

8745117,5,B019GFP0Z4,"Just saw this charming French Belgian satire at the Seattle International Film Festival. It was a hit at the festival, and with good reason. God's daughter decides that her father is kind of a jerk. She makes an epic act of rebellion and takes off to write her own story, as her older brother JC counsels her. The film follows her adventures to find her new apostles. It's funny, surprisingly deep and totally worth the time.  A snarling Benot Poelvoorde plays God as a cranky old coot who maliciously managed Earth's affairs clad in a bathrobe, wife beater, and pajama bottoms. Catherine Deneuve plays one of the new apostles, finding her true love in a most unexpected place. French comedienne Yolande Moreau plays his meek-as-a-mouse wife, who happens to be a goddess in her own right, and who takes her rightful place in the course of the film. The movie is completely delightful. I recommend it",1465084800,6,899,4.762820512820513

8745119,1,B019GFP0Z4,"There are no English subtitles. There are no French subtitles. There is no disc menu! If you hit any button on your remote control, you see the Axia logo. (Axia: The Go-To Name for Horribly Authored DVDs, apparently).

I own the French DVD of this film (from Amazon.fr), and that also falsely advertised English dubbing, and it did not contain English subtitles but did have French subtitles. The listing here incorrectly says the film is in English -- obviously, I knew it wasn't -- but subtitles are required by law for the hard of hearing, and this release offers no subtitles of any kind.",1457222400,41,592,4.6923076923076925
