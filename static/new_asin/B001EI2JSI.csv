8298262,5,B001EI2JSI,"Mr. Prendergast was a former writer for MTV's Celebrity Death Match.  Besides the short films, he's also written/directed/starred in ""Kabluey,"" a feature length film with ""Friends'"" Lisa Kudrow.  He has a unique style of humor-it's very hard to compare to anything else out there.  All the films on this compilation are absolutely worth seeing.  The Associated Press said of ""Anna Is Being Stalked:"" ""Pound for pound, this short film may have been the most entertaining seven minutes at Sundance 2002.""  I think that about sums it up, and that's just one of the short films included.  I personally am looking forward to more from Scott.",1301011200,4,636,5.0095238095238095

Some experiences (like riding a new roller coaster, having a  late night dance party, or going on a remote camping trip) make my brain feel all fresh and new and alive.  It's like the experience opens things up in my head and gives them a stir. ""The Delicious"" did this to me. I've never forgotten it.",1219276800,6,388,4.375
