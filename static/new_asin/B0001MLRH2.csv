8014770,3,B0001MLRH2,"Professional will learn nothing new, but for beginners this DVD is great ... if you have another book with a little bit more theory in addition. I was educated in the C-A-G-E-D layout of the fretboard when I started to practice using this DVD, and the knowledge of C-A-G-E-D helped to to understand what was really going on. You can get a lot out of this DVD even without the basic ideas of the fretboard, but with the logic in your head you can moce every pattern all over the neck ... and then it is fun.",1168387200,2,506,4.22680412371134
