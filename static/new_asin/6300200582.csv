The entire ""The Prisoner"" series was a great and interesting show. The concept of a far away place where political dissonance are abducted and taken away only to wake up in a new society that has no ties to the outside world.

Vote for number six!

Love this idea and concept, the entire 'village' being a real place in Portmeirion.",1405555200,,629,5.077669902912621

Simple?  Seems like it, but hardly anyone in the UK anticipated the twist in the tail that was ""Fallout"".  Or if they did, they certainly didn't go public!

Contrary to a previous comment, The Prisoner is NOT about friendship and stuff.  It's about ... well, just watch who The Prisoner takes home with him (or who he is taken home by?) and ESPECIALLY watch what happens to the front door on The Prisoner's London house after he goes inside.

The Prisoner is STILL one of the most unique, intriguing and enigmatic TV series ever made.  And what makes it so popular all these years later?  Maybe the fact that, in less bizarre form, it tells a story that we're all living?

Get the whole series, and enjoy - as a philisophical or even metaphysical metaphor, or just as rattling good, fast moving entertainment.  It works so well, and on so many levels, there's something for just about everyone.
(The only reason I've marked this item down is because it's cheaper to buy the multi-episode tapes/DVDs.)",1001808000,,1134,4.653266331658291

This, the final epsiode, provides an operatic climax to the hours of bizarre allegory that preceeds it. It is a very British take on the  general paranoia of the time, and can be enjoyed almost as much for its  evocation of the era as for its sheer entertainment value. And remember,  the Village really does exist!  Highly strange TV at its best. This is must  be what Oliver Stone grew up on.",947462400,4,478,4.386363636363637
