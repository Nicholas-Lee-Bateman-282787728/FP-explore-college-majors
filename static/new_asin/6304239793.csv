827742,2,6304239793,"This movie is very close to the novel by Cynthia Voigt. The children have acted very well and you feel everything is real. The grandmother played by Anne Bancroft is simply too good. She is equally well complimented by Dicey , the eldest of the kids who is in fact the central character. Kimberlee Peterson gives an extraordinary portrayal of this character. Hats off to the makers of this beautiful emotion packed movie.

827743,5,6304239793,Anne Bancroft gives a stellar performance in this sure to be family classic.  The young actors are great in their roles too.  You'll want to watch this often.,1129507200,9,158,4.607142857142857
827744,5,6304239793,"I first viewed this movie in 1997, and fell in love with the film immediately.

This film is a rarity in cinema, in regard to the fact that it follows the book (by Cynthia Voight) quite accurately. I've seen so many films, particularily in America, in which the cinematic/television rendition of a novel seems to veer far away from the original story. This film does not, and I credit director Mark Jean for faithfully adapting this wonderful novel to film. Special mention is also due to screenwriter Christopher Carlson for his loyalty to the author's literary art of this story.

The four children in this film will steal your heart. Far too many films attempt the use of 'sentimentalism' as a tactic for capturing the viewer. This film, on the contrary, wins us over through its stark reality in what might happen under such dire circumstances as juvenile-sibling homelessness. We, the viewers, begin to discover ourselves feeling enveloped by the trials & difficulties these children face. The four kids are indeed good actors. Nevertheless, it is their fortitude that we come to admire, (particularily that of 'Dicey', played in a stealth peformance by Kimberlee Peterson).

Moreover, words cannot accurately describe the sheer, stunning performance, (during the latter half of this film), brought forth by Academy Award winner Anne Bancroft. Assuredly, there is not an actress living today who can boast of a talent greater than the awe-inspiring Ms. Bancroft. What separates an 'everyday' actor from the 'great' ones? Simply stated, it is when we view a film and we find ourselves BELIEVING the character we see before us on the screen. For the better part of an hour, I had totally forgotten that the lovely Anne Bancroft had been cast for this film. Instead, I saw Abigail..... a reclusive and mean-stricken (on the surface) old lady, who has such an overwhelming burden of hurt deep within her, one tends to think she is beyond despair. Yet the willed-determination of a child, of grandchildren who desire nothing more than the tiniest sliver of acceptance...... can even the most crotchety of human beings turn away those who need him/her above all else?

In this film, the outcome is not predictable as one might assume. If you're wishing to view a dramatic story/film that you'll not soon forget, ""Homecoming"" is a choice highly-recommended.",1123632000,52,2355,5.030769230769231

827746,5,6304239793,"I have never read the book before and I didn't even know there was a book until after I read a few of the reviews here on Amazon.  I loved the movie.  It was very, very touching.  The story made perfect sense to me even though I haven't read the book.  The characters are well written and these kids are wonderful actors.  Dicey is a brave young girl who takes on horrific responsibilities one can only imagine.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a night of struggles, loss, love and triumph.

Oh, and Anne Bancroft is wonderful in this film.  Her character makes me want to laugh, cry and get physically violent all at the same time! LOL!",1116028800,,657,4.371900826446281
827747,5,6304239793,"The actors in this movie are SUBERB. The kids all did a wonderful job. I must say though that I would highly, highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie. By itself, I'm not sure that the movie would make much sense in the fact that a lot of important scenes from the book were cut for the sake of time. But if you have read the book, the movie gives you pictures and further imprints the story in your mind; as I said, the acting is incredible. The characters are all real and diverse and the actors are nearly perfect for their parts. Again, read the book before you watch the film. As long as that base is covered, this is an excellent movie.",1073433600,2,661,4.253968253968254
827748,5,6304239793,"It was one of those Fridays in late Spring when a teacher just wants to pop in a video for the middle schoolers that teaches without a lesson, entertains without 'the bad stuff', and holds the kids' attention through superb acting, and not idiacy.
I had heard several students mention 'Dicey's Song' as a favorite Accelerated Reader book, and decided to rent this film, which is in the same series. Not only did the kids love 'The Homecoming'--I loved it too!
The story centers around Dicey and her younger brothers and sister. They are abandoned by their mother in a mall parking lot, and struggle to find a place in the world to accept them.
Ann Bancroft, a veteran first-rate actress in every respect, carries the 'heavy' role as the reclusive and often strange grandmother. She dominates the film, and must've been a model of acting excellence to the kids! The children are wonderful too. Each of the four is believeable in character, and convincing in performance.
The strength of 'The Homecoming' (besides Bancroft) is the cinematography. It is wonderfully filmed! Shadow and light, water and mist, camera angle and mood creation--all lift the film well above average for this type genre. 'The Homecoming' owes much to the masterful touch of a director's keen knowlege of children, and New England.
I can't find much to criticize in this film. Other than a six-year-old making an overt (though true) reference to all the children having the same father, and later briefly showing his  behind in a rainstorm sequence, the film is safe, true to the author's intent, and expertly crafted.
There are few movies which my seventh-graders ask to borrow. This is one.",988243200,27,1665,4.904255319148936
827749,5,6304239793,"If you like the book, you'll LOVE the movie! Homecoming is just about the sweetest movie I've ever seen in my life, and it's got to be one of my  favorites, too. It's impossible to find - but if you find it, go for it!  There won't be a dry eye, though, I can tell you that!",967852800,3,274,3.789473684210526

827939,5,6304239793,"This hard to find TV movie is a heartwarming adaptation of a book by the same name. Perhaps it's not promoted now as runaways are faced with a lot more perils than when this story was first published and here running away is the solution. That said, the movie is a wonderful example of how to do an adaptation of a novel. Many of the scenes in the book eliminated to condense the story for the movie didn't hurt the story. And the dialog borrowed from the book was included in just the right places, keeping true to the story's core. Anne Bancroft gives a riveting performance. The younger cast members did a good job as well.",1404345600,2,626,4.358974358974359

There is no way IN HELL to tell me this DVD verison costs 98.00 or 156.00 I think these people are real drug dealers who have a code for those wanting to purchase large amounts of dope and that's look for the outrageous price on DVD's on AMAZON and you've found them.... Be SMART... The HAllmark channel shows it now every few weeks.... TAPE IT or pay someone to TAPE IT on VHS tape or directly onto the DVD Recordable machines..

These people selling dvd's for $$$ can stick it up their a s s e s .... don't be a fool it will come down when NO ONE buys them... to a reasonable 10.00 They are probably copies these indviduals made themselves otherwise this dvd would be on the martket at a reasonable price so Amazon is allowing ILLEGAL copies of this film to be sold.

Finally Netfilx got it and put it in my queue and was not disappointed when seeing it again after all these years. i didn't realize the movie was based on a book which is the first book of the Tillerman Series. i have ordered the next 3 books and look forward to reading them. i started the Homecoming and am very impressed how faithful the movie is to the book unlike say the Harry Potter series. the casting was a master stroke. even though the books target audience is young folks i found it a darn fine read.  i wish they had made more films based on this series but hope it gets released again with a lower price so more folks can enjoy this Great story!,1253491200,,749,4.201388888888889

828124,5,6304239793,"Abandoned by their mother, 3 small children have to rely on the fortitude and strength of their older sister (herself but a child). Determined to keep the family together, she avoids the authorities and, virtually penniless, leads her charges on a long walk in search of an aunt they've never seen. The aunt has died, so they continue in quest of a grandmother, who, left bitter and reclusive by a repressive marriage and loss of her children, gives them a less than warm welcome. The children need someone who can provide security, the grandmother needs someone who can provide love and companionship, but can fulfilment of this mutual need stand against her intransigence? Resolution comes in an underplayed scene without dialogue which is more telling than any I've seen in a movie in a long time. The film can't be faulted: story, script, direction, casting and acting are topnotch, with great performances by the child actors and Anne Bancroft (what a natural actress she was). PS: Bonnie Bedelia is almost unrecognisable in her role as the children's spinsterish cousin, a tribute to her performance and the work of makeup/costume dept.",1181865600,17,1142,5.015789473684211

I didn't recognize Bonnie Bedelia until I saw her name in the credits, she so completely transforms herself to play the querelous cousin and the kids are great.  Beautiful locations and sets, and no less than a score by G Snuffy Walden (thirtysomething, West wing).

I'd read the books as a teenager and had such fond memories that it was like seeing a long forgotten photo of a dear friend.  I sat back that night and eagerly waited for it to start but when it did, I was horrified.  Dicey was nothing like I had expected, she didn't even look like a boy which was the whole point of the book, I was so disappointed that I almost turned the thing off.  I decided to give it 5 more minutes, if for no other reason than to have a good moan.  In that 5 minutes, it won me over.  The acting was wonderful: it wasn't over acted, overly dramatic or overly sentimental and when Anne Brancroft came on the scene I laughed and laughed. Her portrayal of the grandmother who lets the children into her heart in spite of herself is alone worth watching.
