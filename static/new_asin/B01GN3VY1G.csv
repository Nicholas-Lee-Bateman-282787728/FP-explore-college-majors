8763196,5,B01GN3VY1G,This was a great movie on Doolittle's Raiders. I didn't know you spelled veteran with two hours and it! But those boys were worth it spelled that way!,1486684800,,150,4.392857142857143
8763197,5,B01GN3VY1G,"I managed to purchase a DVD of this documentary recently. I found it to be a definative telling of the Doolitle Raiders mission against Japan. Added to the story of the raid, we have a brief highlighted biography of EVERY crew member who took part, including his position, aircraft, and aircraft number within the group. It finishes with the wonderful story of the ""Tontine"" related to the Raiders, and ending with The Final Toast.
  For me this is as good as it gets for a documentary, while the icing on the cake was Region 0 viewable...
