That was more than a month ago.  Now, I can say, without reservation, this is the best yoga video I've ever come across.  The routine is both physically challenging and spirtually calming.  The setting is exquisite, the instructions are easy to follow, and as the teacher, Ms. Rivera is extraordinarily talented and inspiring.

Before getting into this routine, I was switching off between doing tai chi and yoga.  But whenever I began to focus on one art, I found myself wondering whether I should be devoting myself to the other.  Jing yoga presents a wonderful combination of yoga and qigong, and in doing so, it touched the soul of the elements I was seeking.

I highly recommend this video to beginners as well as to seasoned practitioners.",1413331200,,917,4.6397515527950315

8484120,4,B005R5DSG6,"I absolutely loved this as a $1.99 instant video rental but the $24.99 price to add it to my streaming library was just too much for me to part with. I would definitely purchase at a lower price point,say $10 lower :-), so I'll keep an eye on it.",1363910400,3,246,4.040816326530612
8484121,5,B005R5DSG6,"This video was great for beginner/intermediate level yoga. It was a good pace and allowed me to focus while doing the most basic yoga poses and flows, with some added variation with arm movements. It is also in a beautiful setting which I enjoyed.",1348876800,4,247,4.636363636363637

The flow of poses allowed me to pay attention to my energy and focus myself. The prayer at the end was particularly helpful in focusing my intent for the day (and beyond).",1344556800,4,285,4.39622641509434
