8099540,5,B000CNGBV2,"Come on FUNimation! I bought this on day of release... You have only released ""SACRIFICE"" (the second part of this set) which was released like AGES ago.. By releasing the ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED"" set of the ""VEGETA"" Saga, you think you could just stop releasing these? It would give you ALOT more money i can garrentee.

Anyway, decent set.. This is not the garbage of the ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED"" editions... But they are only good for the affordable price than these ""superior"" (in my opinion) sets are.. You get a FREE Extra which is included in the box.. That will hold the other FIVE DVDs that FUNimation SHOULD have been released by now.. They have only released ""SACRIFICE"" which is the second DVD..

This DVD is called ""SAIYAN INVASION"" and includes Three Episodes of ""THE ULTIMATE UNCUT SPECIAL EDITION"" which are renamed:

Episode 22 - ""THE DARKEST DAY""
Episode 23 - ""SAIBAMEN ATTACK!"" &
Episode 24 - ""THE POWER OF NAPPA""

(They were renamed because there are more Episodes than the original ""SAIYAN"" Saga had which were Edited from these true Uncut sets)

And has aload of Trailers and Extras... These sets are still recommended for the ""DRAGON BALL"" Fan in general...

But be warned... If you want this for the entire set.. You would be disappointed, simply because FUNimation have NOT released the last three DVDs yet.. We only get one more... ""SACRIFICE"" If you buy the ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED"" set.. You would get more Episodes which is far better compared to this, its only let down is the poor WIDESCREEN garbage... But if you don't care about that... Then buy..

But still... Damn you FUNi! Release them now!",1203379200,,1621,4.830324909747293
8099541,3,B000CNGBV2,"So should I go over this disc, or FUNimation's incredible idea to doop you outta your hard earned money?

Basically you are paying $35 for a box and one DVD with only 3 episodes.

The contents.

DVD contains the beginning of the fight between Goku and Nappa.

Okay anyone whos read my reviews knows that I despise FUNimation and how it advertises this as the ULTIMATE UNCUT edition.  While it is technically true, the music and script are garbage.  And yet, they do an AMAZING job on Fullmetal Alchemist, Desert Punk, Yu Yu Hakusho and everything else that they do.  Hell, if they can make me enjoy 4Kids Entertainment properties such as Yu-Gi-Oh! and Shaman King, then FUNimation are miracle workers!  And yet Dragon Ball Z is always garbage when they touch it!

The music is your average beats and generic guitar strums.  It's disappointing...

The reasons why I bashed the script, it's so similar to the first dub from 1996 that it makes you wonder, why the heck did they redub it in the first place?  It changes concepts to hide the truth of things in life from little kids, I can understand that considering that back then, DBZ was directed at children, but this DBZ is directed to hardcore fans and teenagers.  Also, starting from the last episode from this disc to episode 53, FUNimation feels the need to add unnecessary cursing.  Yes, I wanted cursing, as well as many other fans because we know that it was in the original.  But FUNimation just goes wild.  FUNimation eventually starts planting D and B bombs all over the place for no reason.

The thing that annoys me the most about this set, FUNImation has already announced a COMPLETE REMASTERED BOX SET of the Saiyan/Vegeta/Frieza sagas for a retail price of $60, less than 2 times more expensive then this set!

Once again, I must give props to the subs on the disc, that really is it, that's probably the best part.  Original Japanese language with subtitles and the Spanish dub.  The Spanish is one of the best dubs I've ever seen so yeah, FUNimation, follow that!",1155600000,7,2031,4.635854341736695
8099542,1,B000CNGBV2,"Do not buy this product.  They stopped releasing these DVDs after Volume 9.  So this Vegeta Saga 2 boxset will have one DVD included, and you can buy one more DVD and that's it.  There will be about 3 more DVDs that will never be released to complete this set.  So people who bought this starter boxset (like me) anticipating more to come got screwed.",1154563200,14,351,4.3538461538461535
