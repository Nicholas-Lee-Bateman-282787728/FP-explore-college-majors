2794695,5,B000ODYV58,"A couple years ago I bought the so-called complete collection from an independent buyer and have been pretty satisfied with the purchase so far.  However, there are shows on this disc that were not included with the collection I bought which is disappointing, but what I expect from a bootleg.  This was my favorite show growing up and even though I already have enough episodes to satisfy any other 25 year old, I will not be happy until I have them all.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone interested in getting back to their childhood- ditch the bootlegs and go for the real thing.  Kudos to the producers for making the complete dvd collections available for us old school Snickers to enjoy.",1216684800,,700,4.666666666666667
2794696,5,B000ODYV58,This is one of the best 90's shows that I remember growing up on. I used to look forward to seeing it every Saturday night on Snick. I was so excited when I saw that I had a chance to own it on DVD. And it's just like I remember it. It's basically about a goup of kids (the Midnight Society) who meet out in the woods every Saturday night & tell scary stories. The cool thing is that there's a message behind each story. It was a great show then & I'm glad to own it now for when I have kids.,1215302400,,492,3.7864077669902914
2794697,3,B000ODYV58,"Season 3 kicks off with some new cast members. The stories are pretty decent, but not as good as the first 2 seasons. A couple of the tales include ""Tale of the Midnight Ride"", ""Tale of The Dream Girl"", ""Tale of the Carved Stone"" to name a few...",1205193600,,246,4.145833333333333
2794698,5,B000ODYV58,"Okay, I'd like to clear up a few things about these dvd sets. ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I almost didn't buy this dvd set, I'm glad I did. Alot of peolpe are wondering if these are bootlegs. They are not. They are 100% authentic dvds. THe show was a canadian show that Nickelodeon co-produced and released in America. The dvds are from the canadian company. Don't expect a Nickelodeon rlease of the show. They seem quite content screwing over fans of early 90's Nick, by cnacleing the release the final season of Pete and Pete, and not putting any of Salute Your Shorts on dvd either. The biggest issue people were worried about with these dvds was The first seasons packaging. It is a tri fold out cardboard case, like a standard tv show dvd is. The problem is, it doesn't include an outer sleeve to put it into. It's supposed to be that way, so don't worry. Not the best packaging, but it works. The other 2 seasons that were released do include an outer sleeve, which I definitly prefer, but the first season is acceptable. The dvds are of great quality, the picture and sound qaulity is great too. Don't expect remastered in surround sound and high def, but they are better than your average tv broadcast quality. Another question people had was about the changed opening. The first season has a changed opening. They cut the regualr opening short and added a bunch of scenes from the show cut to the credits music. Season 2 and 3 have the original opening you all remember and love. And finally, the question of altered scenes in episodes. In the first season, The Tale of The Hungry Hounds, a scene in the begining is cut where the main characters friend jumps out and scares her in the attic. It cuts akwardly instead to her reacting and doesbn't make any sense in the context. I don't know why thet did it, but the episode is far from ruined with that 5 second scene excised. The only other part thet changed was the song at the end of the Prom Queen episode. They changed it because they lost the rights to the song. Again, not a big deal, but be forewarned. These dvds are definitly worth the price, and they will play in your dvd player. They are Region 1 which is North America and Canada so don't worry. They are not available in American stores as far as I know, so ebay and amazon are your best bet for getting them. Hope this helped to clear up a few things, and let's hope they put out the rest of the incredible show soon!",1182124800,25,2484,4.355603448275862
2794699,5,B000ODYV58,"Oh, to be young again. I love the fact that my old tv shows are on dvd. One might have thought that they would stop at season 2- but it looks like all the seasons will be on dvd soon. Season 3 is better than than 1 and 2 because the episodes became more inventive and scarier. The bookish babysitter is one of the shows more popular episodes. These sets are a steal at the asking price. This show made me so happy as a kid and at the age of 25 I still find myself getting lost with the Midnight Society. Although there are no extras, lets be honest- you buy this because it is a cool show that almost never had a chance of getting to dvd. The 3 disc collections includes the following episodes.

1. The tale of the Midnight Ride

2. The tale of Apartment 214

3. The tale of the Watcher's Woods

4. The tale of the phone police

5. The tale of the dollmaker

6. The tale of the Bookish Babysitter

7. The tale of the Carved Stone

8. The tale of the Guardian's Curse

9. The tale of the Curious Camera

10. The tale of the Dream Girl

11. The tale of the Quicksilver

12. The tale of the Crimson Clown

13. The tale of the Dangerous Soup

Such an inventive show for kids and adults who just want to sit down and remember what it feels like to be a kid again.",1180137600,15,1258,3.98

8184807,4,B000ODYV58,"My whole family would watch this show every Friday night as part of the nick line up, it was something we all did as a family, make popcorn and watch these scary tales. Takes me back to the 90's. This season was one of my favorites, all good episodes on this one. The price was a little high but after putting it on and watching, its worth it. All the old nick shows are coming back around, but these true dvds are hard to come by.",1312070400,,431,4.023255813953488

8184810,5,B000ODYV58,"Are You Afraid of the Dark was one of the best shows Nickelodeon ever played. The kids used to watch it every day after school, and can't believe they don't play it anymore. When I found out it was on dvd I had to get it, and it is definitely worth the price. This series is classic and should be a part of every fan's dvd collection. Some of the best episodes are on this season: Watcher's Woods, The Dollmaker, and The Bookish Babysitter.",1258070400,2,440,4.25
