8483667,2,B005QROGQG,"The movie will have your head spinning trying to keep up with what is going on. The plot is good, but there are far to many side tracks in reaching the end of the mystery. To much to keep up with and to many people getting in the way of keeping the move of the plot easy to understand. As a matter of fact it becomes confusing, mixed up and causes one to become very tired of trying to keep up with it all. It's a mess. As for the picture almost good. The sound is fine. I buy movies with the idea of watching them many times and this is not one of those. Yes it is fast moving, but the moving gets mixed up so often you want to scream.",1412812800,,636,3.8257575757575757
