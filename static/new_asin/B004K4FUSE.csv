4392548,5,B004K4FUSE,"this is just what TV movies are all about.
It was definitely worth seeing and the acting was good.
I mainly watched this because Raven was in it and she did really good in her role.
Especially when she played ""disguise"" again, like she did in her tv show ""That's So Raven"".
As for the girl in the movie who lost the man of her dreams, they could've at least casted a CUTER girl LOL
But overall, i love the movie.
It was really nice.",1310947200,,432,4.094117647058823
4392549,5,B004K4FUSE,"I won't bore you with another re-cap of the movie, every other review has done a fine job at that.  I do have to admit I was a little skeptical in watching this because it has Raven Symone in it and I automatically think of the over acted, annoying and ridiculous show ""all about Raven"".  But I don't know who I liked better, her or Joanna Garcia, they are both totally adorable in this movie.  Raven is hilarious and definentley shines as the sarcastic and sometimes tempermental best friend while Joanna's character is level-headed and supportive.  Both girls are lovable!!  You must watch this!",1310342400,,597,4.701923076923077
4392550,5,B004K4FUSE,"I thought the movie was GREAT! I love Raven Symone' and Joanna Garcia! And, the fact that it was my granddaughers first movie made it very special! Her name is Kaysia Monique Stove she played the role of Young Abigail!!",1305763200,,219,4.5
4392551,5,B004K4FUSE,"The movie is predictable. The humor is snarky. There are some plot weaknesses. The characters are unrealistic. But it spite of whatever criticism I could come up with, the fact is that it worked well to give us a very enjoyable film. Raven-Symon&eacute; and Joanna Garcia-Swisher absolutely shine in this LOL comedy about 3 girls determined to ruin the wedding of their childhood girlfriend Caitlyn McNabb played by Virginia Williams. Caitlyn is getting married to Tony, the former boyfriend of Rachel (Chryssie Whitehead). She claims she is pregnant by him and in this small Louisiana town, that is what they are expected to do. Rachel is still in love with him, and the girls suspect something isn't right.

Some minor sexual references.",1305676800,,739,5.057377049180328
4392552,5,B004K4FUSE,I did enjoy watching this movie it was very funny. And I am glad I bought it so I can watch it again and again.,1304121600,,111,3.48
4392553,5,B004K4FUSE,"Oh my God. I thought this was going to be a stupid movie, I saw Raven Symone and said 'this is another of her stupid movies where she tries so hard to be funny.' But wow, it was really good; good story line, actually funny, and it wasn't just about her, it revolved around the three bridesmaids. I watched it with my sisters, and they liked it also. I could watch it again and be entertained. Seriously though, it was a good movie.",1304035200,,431,4.204819277108434
4392554,5,B004K4FUSE,"I absolutely loved this movie. It is anything but the typical wedding movie. In this film the blushing bride doesn't get her happy fairytale ending while her lifelong friends watch her in bliss; so happy. No. Instead the story takes a more interesting turn where karma kicks in like its supposed to. This movie is absolutely hysterical and very entertaining to watch. It also has some sweet romances woven into the storyline that are quite enjoyable to watch blossom. This is a wonderfully funny and sweet movie that I have found myself watching over and over again. If you are a fan of romantic comedies but you are sick of the same old storylines, watch this movie. BubblesReviews.com  Rating: 5 out of 5",1299456000,,706,4.739837398373984
4392555,5,B004K4FUSE,"""Revenge of the Breidesmaids"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! It gives standard romantic comedies a run for their money with a number of plot twists and plenty of wit!

""Revenge of the Bridesmaids"" has underlying messages of friendship, love, and, as the title suggests, revenge. You will laugh, smile, and laugh some more while watching this movie!

The comedic timing of both Raven-Symon (Abigail Scanlon) and JoAnna Garcia (Parker Wald) really make this movie what it is!
Their talent is undeniable!

Out of all the ABC Family movies I've seen, this one is 10 steps ahead of the others.

A guaranteed favorite for all comedy fans! :)",1298764800,10,656,4.728070175438597
4392556,4,B004K4FUSE,"Four young girls grew up together, and even then they were divided into the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" One girl lived in a home so large that they joked it had its own zip code. But girls grow up, and their lives went in different directions.

Abigail (Raven-Symon&eacute;) and Parker (Joanna Garcia) live in New York City. They are ""marginally successful"" with their careers in writing and acting, respectively. Rachel (Chryssie Whitehead) lives in her original small town, but at least has a great, loving boyfriend. Caitlyn (Virginia Williams), daughter of mansion owner Olivia (Beth Broderick), left for college and sorority life.

And during a family reunion, Abigail and Parker learn that Caitlyn is going to marry Rachel's boyfriend, to Rachel's dismay. Somehow, Olivia is in control of all this... a nefarious plot?

Time for Abigail and Parker to support Rachel and break up this wedding. But how? First, they need to get themselves invited to be bridesmaids. Then... revenge! In the first 30 seconds of the movie, you'll get a very good idea of how this is going. The bridesmaids have been arrested!

I was worried that this made-for-TV movie, Revenge of the Bridesmaids, was going to be corny, goofy, stereotypic, and shallow. Thankfully, it was much better than expected. The down-to-earth nature of Abigail and Parker, the exquisite preparations for the wedding, the imperfections of all the characters, and the overall intrigue made this movie work.

Cute, family-friendly, first date movie.",1296604800,10,1503,5.1687242798353905
4392557,5,B004K4FUSE,"Raven and Joanna Garcia are lifelong friends.  When they (Abigail and Parker) return from New York City to visit their home town, they discover that their best friend Rachel is a bridesmaid in the wedding of their childhood friend, Caitlyn (aka spoiled little rich girl, and Tony, who was Rachel's boyfriend until Caitlyn interfered. Abigail and Parker decide to run some interference of their own. They manipulate Caitlyn and become bridesmaids as well so that they and Rachel can sabotage the wedding from the inside. That's when the hilarity begins!  With help from a police detective who happens to be a groomsman, the girls strive to ruin Caitlyn's wedding while dodging her controlling mother and hopefully reuniting Tony and Rachel. As an added bonus, one of the girls adds some romance to her own life. You can kinda predict the ending, but there is so much action, and so many laughs getting there it's very enjoyable.  We have been waiting to hear that it's available on dvd.",1296604800,3,985,4.88622754491018

4392564,3,B004K4FUSE,"It wasn't painful to watch. The story has good potential, but ends up being a little bit corny. Younger audiences, like teens, might enjoy it more than adults, but at least it's wholesome enough with no violence or bad language.",1449360000,,228,4.725

I did find out this was a TV movie, so that explains a lot. It was light hearted but I just did not enjoy it. The storyline was dull. The humor did not make me laugh. The actors were mediocre at best. I love Rom-coms but I did not like this one. Thought I should let others know that you may not love this like most of the reviewers did for some reason. If you are incredibly bored and have absolutely nothing to do, still, do ANYTHING but this. Ugh what a waste of time and mula.",1365465600,,618,4.032520325203252

This is a movie that my wife wanted to see.  First, she likes romantic comedies, and second we prefer movies that entertain us and get us to laugh.  Revenge of the Bridesmaids meets both of our goals.  There is romance and the film is funny so we were entertained.

In the story, four girls become friends as children and remain together throughout school and into their lives as young adults.  One on the four, Caitlin, has always enforced her will upon the others (Rachel, Abigail, and Parker), and lorded over the others because of her wealth and social position.  Eventually she steals Rachael's  boyfriend and decides to marry him.

Caitlin asks the other three to be her bridesmaids and they reluctantly agree.  Then Abigail decides that Caitlin is really after Rachael's boyfriend for his money and that they should expose Caitlin.  The fun begins.  The battle to expose Caitlin provides  a lot of funny scenes.

The DVD does not have any ""extras"", including closed caption for the hearing impaired.  The producers did not mention this lack of service so the buyer gets a second class product for first class prices.

Decades ago actors were trained how to enunciate so that the audience could  understand dialogue.  Recently many actors lack this skill, and, as a result, even with volume near maximum, it is tough to understand dialogue.  Close captions correct that problem.

This is a good movie.  It is funny with excellent acting.  The DVD does not do it justice.
I must rate Bridesmaids Revenge DVD as an average movie due to lack of technical support.",1316822400,8,1569,4.819548872180451

The actors are just right for their parts, and even though they over-act at times, it just seems to add to the crazy fun.  Watch the facial expressions and listen to the lines.  They will have you rolling with laughter.  This is a fun movie, and should be taken as such - just a lot of laughs.",1311984000,,371,4.111111111111111
