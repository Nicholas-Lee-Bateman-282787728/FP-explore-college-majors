7738994,5,B01ENGE7FA,"Interesting and fun mockumentary for those who enjoy women's studies and also those who like stories that are a fun & satirical take on alternative histories. (note: If you like Terry Pratchett, I *think* you'll like this) Fun to watch, clean, nothing to make anyone uncomfortable. Does poke fun at men a bit.",1468972800,3,309,4.849056603773585
7738995,3,B01ENGE7FA,"No Men Beyond This Point is a mockumentary that imagines a world where, since 1953, women have been able to reproduce without men and they are no longer giving birth to male babies. Now, over 60 years later, this deadpan film follows the youngest man still alive  37-year-old Andrew Myers (Patrick Gilmore), who works as a caretaker for a family of women. Though its not the best job in the world, it beats living in one of the mens sanctuaries and eating estrogen-laced pork chops to suppress their desire to revolt. Andrew finds himself at the center of a battle to prevent men from going extinct.

Director Mark Sawers has put together a hit-and-miss picture that starts with an intriguing premise. Several of the set pieces are clever, but there are far too many talking head segments that fail to fully exploit cinematic technique. The movies spoof archival footage sequences are smart and very funny, but sustaining the central idea is tricky, and the films 80-minute running time overstays its welcome.

The unrated widescreen DVD contains no bonus features.",1468627200,10,1065,4.93854748603352
7738996,4,B01ENGE7FA,"What a surprise!... the makers of this film showed remarkable ingenuity and skill. The documentary show of the type we have seen on TV hundreds of times includes interviews, flashbacks, and commentaries.

7738998,2,B01ENGE7FA,"One of the lesser science fiction themes has been the idea of a world with no men.  It is a fascinating question - what kind of society would
evolve if the world were entirely dominated by women?  There have been several fascinating treatments of the general theme (e.g. Alice Sheldon's ""Houston, Huston DoYou Read?"") but this one is just silly.  The premise is that in 1953 women all over the world began giving birth parthenogenetically, that is without insemination (no males involved) producing (naturally) all female offspring.  At the same time the male birthrate takes a nose dive and the last male on Earth is born c. 1979.  This is an interesting set up but the story quickly loses its nerve and doesn't go much of any place.  Too bad.",1468281600,4,744,4.684615384615385

7739006,2,B01ENGE7FA,"It would have been VERY timely subject matter--and a great consolation holiday gift. Except it ran waay too long to maintain interest I actually found myself falling asleep.

The parts at the beginning are REALLY badly put together. Yes we understand the 1950's overall sucked for the status of everybody who was not a straight white woman (which gets into interesting questions about the movie's own cast!) But they missed out on actually making something genuinely entertaining. It required a little more work, but it could have been done.

Please pass this one up. Not worth it.",1481414400,,581,4.979381443298969

It is ""sexist"" toward both men and women equally, which makes it evenly funny and evenly offensive. It doesn't really have anything sexually suggestive in it though. I would say that the family could watch it together. This dvd is done documentary style, so keep that in mind before purchase. The narrative definitely makes you think outside the box.",1480550400,4,481,4.878048780487805

7739011,1,B01ENGE7FA,It was a very bad movie. Purported liberal ideas (as I assumed). It did not describe the issue of transsexual men or woman. Just in general very poor movie... Not worth the $5.00. IMO...,1479772800,3,186,4.5
7739012,3,B01ENGE7FA,"This ""mocumentary"" presents an alternate history where starting in 1953, women begin to spontaneously give birth to girls without having sex, while at the same time, ordinary births, especially male births, go into steep decline.  By the time most of the film's action takes place, in the ""modern"" era, the ""youngest man in the world"" is 37 years old, and most men have been relegated to what amount to reservations, where they are housed and fed, but cannot leave.

What's questionable are the reactions of most of the people shown, where the men (with a few exceptions) submit meekly to their imprisonment, including prohibitions against ""congregating"" in groups of more than two, while the women don't seem to miss them all that much.  Whether one wants to read some kind of radical feminist agenda into this, or sees it as a Saturday Night Live sketch that goes on way too long, probably depends on one's reaction upon hearing that women earn less than men for the same work, or how one views Donald Trump's boasting about ""grabbing p*y.""  Overall, the film is an example of high concept - a great premise that becomes tedious as it plays itself out with too many talking heads, and the little drama at the end throws the entire argument into question, as if the filmmaker couldn't take his idea to its logical conclusion.",1477699200,2,1326,4.777292576419214
7739013,5,B01ENGE7FA,"Such a funny AND thought-provoking mockumentary! And even funnier to see how many reviewers got offended about some it as though the intent was some sort of attack on either gender...it's satire! The simple fact is that the script did a great job of poking fun at gender roles of both men and women as well as various personality types with the different topics that were raised related to this completely unrealistic proposed dystopian future.

I have the most difficult time finding movies I actually enjoy watching - it's like action movies and most sci-fi movies seem to just be trying to out-do the last with how flashy they are. This movie was a pleasant, clever, surprise to stumble upon.",1477699200,,695,4.791666666666667

7739019,4,B01ENGE7FA,"Contrary to first impressions, No Men Beyond This Point was not put together by man-hating feminists (unless Director | Writer | Producer Mark Sawers hates himself), but it is an outright comedic challenge to our everyday non-thinking about gender roles and the so-called ""battle of the sexes. Assuredly, female viewers have the opportunity here to feel a guilty pleasure about seeing a world dominated and controlled by women, and male viewers with a fragile ego or rigid outlook re: what it means to be a man may yell at the screen in disgust and then abort what could have been an enjoyable evening.

This movie gives us the opportunity to engage in a marathon of considering our own cultures by confronting us, in a good-natured and humorous manner, with what can only be described in contemporary terms as preposterous social arrangements. The story pushes hard, but not so hard as to be completely beyond the pale; although the events will not unfold in our own world (other than some of the communal living scenarios, which already exist in various forms), you could almost believe them in a parallel universe. And again, lets not miss the point: this is a comedy. It is neither misogynistic nor misandristic; if a viewer sees either, then it speaks more of a viewer's experiences or beliefs than it does about the probable intent of this particular film.

No Men fits into a narrow (but ripe with possibility) subgenre of science fiction devoid of spacecraft, aliens, or even futuristic gadgetry: its simply an alternate timeline, a reality that might have happened in our own history had one major detail been altered. Although undoubtedly far-fetched, the premise is at least roughly based on scientific principles: parthenogenesis and the importance of both X and Y allosomes. Oh, and to help make it legit with sci-fi fans, Rekha Sharma (BSG's Tory Foster/ Cylon Final Five) plays an excellent role in No Men that must have been difficult to perform with such a straight face.

The acting is slyly purposeful in trying to convey the true (often suppressed) underlying feelings of No Men's many characters towards men, yet it manages to do so in ways that will fly under your radar if you are not watching closely; its easy to miss some of the emotions if you are accustomed to watching your movies while knitting, doing homework, or otherwise not devoting your attention. The pick for the youngest man in the world (the protagonist in the film, assuming there is one) was fortuitous and holds the narrative together. I figured out No Men is a Canadian production by recognizing some familiar faces I knew to be Vancouver / British Columbia actors, but even without this hint it doesn't take long to realize (if you are familiar with our lovely neighbor to the North) it's the type of premise that would be conjured up by a Canadian... like Mark Sawers.

The final 10 seconds of the movie seriouslyand hilariously throws a wrench into everything, and Sawers should be commended for choosing a proper ending in an era of flicks tending to present unsatisfactory fades to black.",1473120000,7,3087,4.8742857142857146

7739023,5,B01ENGE7FA,"Right on.  Men are responsible for most of the world's problems.  I am a man; surprise surprise.  The main idea behind this hilarious mockumentary was first addressed in 1972 by Charles Eric Maine in his novel ALPH, released in paperback as WORLD WITHOUT MEN (with the best Ace cover art ever made, of a horny female of the far future).  Maine projected that genetic engineering would attempt to care for a male embryo created by a ""microcytological transfer.""  It had to be guarded.  ""The world had not seen a 'man' in over 500 years.""  Tag line: there was no telling what the strange creature might do.  Back to this wonderful movie.  An honest man will have to laugh and cry at the Truth of the Guilt inherent in the huMAN race.  My family could not stop laughing, especially after one wife admitted, 20 minutes in, to thinking the movie was a factual scientific documentary possibly made by NOVA or The History Channel.  It's that great.  The hidden reason for negative reviews is obvious: male viewers see themselves dissed in this movie.  Another possibility is the reviewers are closet Catholics;  the movie has a running joke about Virgin Births that includes several pregnant nuns, with denials and cover ups from The Vatican.  Blind faith demands indignant responses.  Who could face the fact that Joseph's feeling were hurt over the first celebrated virgin birth?  Search your souls.  Shame on negatives:  haters gotta hate.",1471910400,10,1435,4.8796680497925315
7739024,5,B01ENGE7FA,"Brilliant, just brilliant. Cleverly and tastefully assembled script that really puts thumb to pulse on the frustrating and sometimes hilarious dichotomy of male/female dynamics, but with a twist. A salute must go out to the brave (and obviously self-secure) men who joined in on the project (and the joke) as well. Being able to poke a little fun at themselves while playing the role with unwavering sobriety made the film both wonderfully refreshing and immensely entertaining to watch. The movie was also quite well-thought out and surprisingly believable from a scientific and biological/evolutional standpoint. I don't believe there has ever been another kind quite like it.  An absolute must-see.",1471824000,6,701,5.431192660550459

7739029,3,B01ENGE7FA,"This was presented like a documentary, yet sorta cheesy.
I think that the idea is an interesting one.  What would happen if women didn't need men to reproduce? What would happen if only females were born of this no men needed conception?  How would all of this effect the population?  If we didn't NEED men to keep our population growing, would we still want them about?
These are very interesting questions to ponder, and apparently someone did enough to get to the point of creating this cheesy mock - umentary.
I guess that it just wasn't my thing. It seemed too far fetched.  As I watched it, I kept thinking of counter arguments for whatever they happened to be talking about at the time.  I suppose, if you are bored, and have nothing else to do, it might be an interesting watch... for free.
Truly, I like a good ""what if"" story, I just didn't see this being realistic at all.  Maybe it was completely meant to be silly and ridiculous, but if they were trying to pose an answer to the ""what if"" question, they seriously fell short.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.",1470700800,,1069,4.423469387755102
