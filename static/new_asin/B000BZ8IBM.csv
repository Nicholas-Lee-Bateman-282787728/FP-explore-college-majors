8094712,5,B000BZ8IBM,"Contains spoilers:
This volume has episodes Freaky Valentine 1-3 which is the duel of Mai and Joey and Joey gets his dragon card. It also contains episodes Fate of the Pharaoh 1-3 which is one of my favorite duels.  It features the duel Yugi vs. Rafael and little yugi gets his soul taken.  This is a great dvd that has some good episodes.  However they only have the first three volumes of Waking the Dragons out and I have no idea when or if they will real release the remaining episodes.",1249084800,3,490,4.362637362637362
8094713,5,B000BZ8IBM,"When I first heard about Yu-Gi-Oh!, I thought it would just be a derivation of Pokemon.  I've never been happier to be proven wrong.  This series has plenty of action and good storylines to keep the show going.  This DVD would be a great purchase for any anime fan.  Thank you for sending this out to me.",1237248000,,304,4.280701754385965
8094714,5,B000BZ8IBM,The best duel in My Freaky Valentine is yugi vs raphael. This is perhaps  the only fair and squre defeat the pharaoh had in the series. you see the pharaoh chose to play the seal and lost. I was realy surprise of the outcome. yugi always wins all his duels. I think raphael accomplished something that Kaiba never did. so yes people I think this dvd is worth owning it.,1219795200,,369,4.271428571428571
8094715,5,B000BZ8IBM,"Possibly in November or December of 2008, the 4th season box set should be released. (But whatever you do KEEP CHECKING from August to Nov, or Dec).
My favorite seasons:
1. Season 5 (Best one)
2. Season 4 (Best Adventureus)
3. Season 3 (Best Storylines)
4. Season 2 (Better Duels)
5. Season 1 (I hope 4kids re-releases this box set)",1212364800,4,332,4.55
