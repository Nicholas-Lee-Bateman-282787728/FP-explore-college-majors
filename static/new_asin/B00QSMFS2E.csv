The casting and acting are very good.  The cast are interesting people that you would like to meet.
The movie has some depth and substance.  It's heartwarming near the end.
I'm a former teacher and I think the teachers are believable as quality teachers.",1429574400,,303,4.921568627450981
6878575,5,B00QSMFS2E,"This is a made for TV film called ""Teachers."" Manny Cortez (Esai Morales) worked long shifts so he could move his family into a shoe box located in the Westbrook High district. His dream is for his daughter to attend Westbrook, the best high school in the state of North Carolina. To everyone's dismay, the school is going to shutdown next year to save money. Dr. Christine (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) a former student of Westbrook is brought in to be the interim principal, change teachers' methods, and make a lay-off list. The teachers, parents, students rally etc. etc.

This is a formula film. The teachers are the best because they are involved in the personal lives of their students and do one on one mentoring. They are dedicated to their students and community and get respect. Oh the school did have a fight.

This is a feel good film that has the right messages. It does bring in ""God"" about 50 minutes into the film and there is one mention of Jesus at 58 minutes. Not heavily religious.

Good film for the tweens, a simple feel good drama.",1429315200,,1054,4.625668449197861

8692661,5,B00QSMFS2E,"I admit I was surprised. I expected just another ""school"" movie, with kids portrayed as back-talking, video gaming, self absorbed, troublemakers. What we get in this movie is a community of parents, children, teachers, and administration in a maze of struggles, compounded by theories vs. facts, money vs. conscience. The positive problem solving with results, of all involved, was refreshing. This movie deserves multiple screenings!",1469750400,,434,5.6923076923076925

8692665,4,B00QSMFS2E,"Really liked this movie for a number of different reasons, good storyline, well written, great actors. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this movie, which would be appropriate since it is about high school. If a lot of people would only insert themselves into the role of some of these actors, they could probably see themselves. Hope that makes sense to some people..",1434758400,,380,4.686567164179104
