2736201,1,B000MGUZAC,"I have to say that I am so very glad that I did not pick this up from the retail store at full price. This has to be without a doubt the dumbest movie ever produced. Everything about it is corny, the acting is terrible. I could not even find anything humourous about it to give it additional stars. Do not buy this, if you want to see it that badly, find it in a video store and rend it or borrow it from a friend who is holding onto it for whatever reason, frankly, I can't see why anyone would want to hold onto this.",1184716800,2,519,3.9056603773584904
2736202,5,B000MGUZAC,"As the writer and director of Love Trap, I know I'm incredibly biased, but this film is indeed a 'must see' film and is worthy of my 5 star rating.  Simply put, you won't find another film that's more insightful about the whole concept of love than this one... if you do please let me know so I can check it out.  Further, this a very thought provoking film, promoting an awareness of the relevance of God in our lives and the current state of popular hip-hop music and how it's affecting black culture.  The story of Love Trap is universal, so I invite people of all backgrounds to watch it and enjoy!",1179273600,,602,4.3097345132743365
2736203,4,B000MGUZAC,"I loved this production when it came to our city and can't wait to see it on DVD. I didn't rate a 5 only because I haven't seen the actual DVD, but if it's anything like the viewing I attended, then by all means, it's a must see!",1179187200,3,229,3.7916666666666665
2736204,5,B000MGUZAC,"Movie Review... LOVE TRAP -- a romantic drama -- Indie Film (Warning, there is some foul language, but the MESSAGE IS AWESOME!!!!)  I loved everything about this movie....the format, directing, the messsage.  I would love for every young person in America to see it.  The writer took quite a volatile situation and played it out from all angles.

As a writer, I am not often blown away by a movie, but this one held my attention, and had me rooting for the main characters until the very end.  I don't often watch movies more than once or twice over the course of 10 or 15 years, but his one is a keeper.  I would love to add it to my small, but elite collection.  It has earned its place on my shelf.

The fresh faces actually helped make the movie better.  We had no expectations of the sterotypes our favorite actors often portray in ""black"" movies.

Truth and the power of love prevailed. And as God is love, then He and the message prevailed.  The message?  Christ loves us in spite of what we do!",1307923200,,1002,4.356756756756757
2736205,4,B000MGUZAC,"Low budget, with a good plot. I enjoyed it, own and have watched it more than once. It was a very good movie to me. Watch your girlfriends ladies!",1296432000,,146,4.068965517241379
2736206,4,B000MGUZAC,"This movie is a classic example of how terrible acting can taint a rather remarkable script.  There is wit and wisdom sprinkled through-out, but the actors, more particularly the girls are horrible.  It is really a shame the way they detract from the dialog.",1259712000,,258,4.840909090909091
2736207,3,B000MGUZAC,"i watched the movie for the 1st time on showtime. i was surprised the story line was addictive and interesting. i love independent films as well. like most would say, the acting did needed improvement but the story line was cool.",1255996800,,229,4.609756097560975
2736208,4,B000MGUZAC,"I am a sucker for a good love story and thought this one was so different from the norm and actually made me think about what we really mean when we say we ""love"" someone.",1241568000,,171,3.914285714285714
2736209,3,B000MGUZAC,"The movie was obviously low budget, and the actors are rookies, but the movie manages to be quite engaging at its strongest points.  While it doesn't rise to the level of a truly great independent film like Marion Bridge, it is a great beginning for the director and the young actors.  In particular, Noble Lee Lester, the male lead, and Julius Golden, the lothario, brought in strong and genuine performances.  The scene where the Christian viewpoint is highlighted seems forced, but I suppose it could be considered simply reflective of the prominence of the church in black life.  Though peppered with a few weak moments, the film is a fresh, inventive, and relevant look at relationships and identity in the lives of young adults of the rising black middle class.  This movie has potential for a remake with a larger budget and higher caliber cast.",1225670400,,852,4.848275862068966
2736210,1,B000MGUZAC,"I try to support black film makers, but this movie was a waste of my money.  Bad acting, bad script.  It was a waste to put on DVD and I wish I could get my money back.",1188518400,2,168,3.5135135135135136
2736211,4,B000MGUZAC,"I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise for an independent film and though I found the acting needed work; but I still believe the themes, script, and screenplay to be unique and original.

Love Trap is a romantic drama about two pre-law students who take a chance on love and each other, who up to a certain point in their relationship trusted each other until another love interest enters the picture.  Their trust and faith is tested and their perfect love comes in jeopardy.

The narration and dialogue really make you reminisce about college days and the possibilities of true love and the choice to love.

If you are going through troubling relationships and questioning the possibility of true love, this movie will give you hope.

Reviewer's Notes:
I am a big fan of independent films and most customers have to realize that independent films tend to have low budgets, including casting, which can explain inconsistencies in the film.  However, independent films like this one tend to tell unique, original, and untold stories which for me accommodates for some of those inconsistencies.

I do have high standards for the movies I watch and really enjoy box office films for their over-the-top action, drama, and acting, but I still have an appetite for independent films.

So if you are a movie lover and independent film fan, you should give this one a chance and add it to your DVD library.",1188086400,10,1406,4.804979253112033

2736213,4,B000MGUZAC,I thought that it was a good movie the acting could have been better because they were new to acting.  But the plot was good about black love and relationships and it made you think that you can't put all your faith in one person whether it your love or your friends.,1184803200,4,267,4.134615384615385

8169364,1,B000MGUZAC,"I am a Jamaican and I love buying Jamaican movies,even the ones that are low budget I will get just to support. Love Trap is not a jamaican movie. It came up under the Amazon search for Jamaican movies and this popped up. It's more of a B rated African American movie. It was ok but I didn't watch all of it yet, didn't peak my interest enough.  I cannot recall exactly but I think one of the characters name is Jamaica maybe that is where they decided to make it a Jamaican movie.

You might still like it but if you are looking for a Jamaican film this is not it.",1362960000,,565,4.035714285714286
