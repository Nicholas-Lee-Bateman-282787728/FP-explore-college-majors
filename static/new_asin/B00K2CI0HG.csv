6399642,5,B00K2CI0HG,"Believe it or not, Reese Witherspoon is a supporting actress in this one.  She's not the sweet one, but her character is touched by the child survivors of the on-going war in Sudan.  They and the ones they represent are the stars, and the script is not based on anyone's imagination; its about their lives.",1418256000,,306,4.545454545454546

6399645,5,B00K2CI0HG,"I have worked in Sudan/South Sudan for over seven years and know many Sudanese refugees living in the U.S. This movie was fantastic. The scenes in South Sudan were surprisingly accurate visually. My wife and I were in tears as we watched knowing we were watching the lives of so many of our friends.

If you have any tie to South Sudan, you should see this. If you have any ties to refugees in the U.S., you should see this. If you live in the U.S., you should see this to have a better idea what it is like for so many refugees coming to our nation. I hate to call this a ""feel good move,"" but it really is. Even so, it has a great message based on very real situations.",1417996800,17,671,4.083333333333333
6399646,5,B00K2CI0HG,"SIMPLY STATED this film was not long enough in town for others to see it.  Thus, extra glad that December 23 it will be released.  As an international leadership mentor, my wife and I sat through the film deeply moved with the authenticity of the story.  I've heard this story from others who were children trying to survive, and did.  The four Sudanese actors were exceptional, as they were playing their roles from experience, not just playing a role.  The the personal level of surviving together, this was epic, even though it was not a ""zillion dollar' blockbuster.  With regard to the human spirit to be alive, fully alive, together, it was huge.  And Reese Witherspoon...we loved watching her character's heart melt and evolve...very well done!  Corey Stoll was exceptional in how he ""got"" the needs of the three men and let them be who they were.  In my work, films like this are crucial to get honest messages across.  It will be used over and over again.  Thank you Margaret Nagle for your exceptional writing, and Philippe Falardeau for exceptional direction.  For anyone who is concerned for the human issues facing our world, this film will stir the soul to help us all know that there are people, even close by, who need love, care, understanding and help in becoming and being released into who they were designed to be.  Well done, The Good Lie team, well done...........!!!",1416787200,,1390,4.7656903765690375

  ~ African proverb ~

Fugitives from the violence that spawned them, we follow three boys and a girl who make an incredible 700-mile trek from the bloodshed in Sudan to the relative safety of a refugee camp. From there, they end up in the United States where cultural shock is inevitable. ""Snow?"" ""Telephone?"" ""Unmarried women?"" Known as ""The Lost Boys,"" they were part of the 3,800 boys and girls brought to the US in the late '90s. (The program was suspended with 9/11.)

Directed by Philippe Falardeau (""Monsieur Lazhar"") working with award-winning scriptwriter Margaret Nagle (""Warm Springs""), this PG-13 film is wrenching, entertaining, and hopeful.

We see:
  * Arnold Oceng (""It's a Lot"") is Mamere the most ambitious one. He realizes during their seven-year sojourn in the refugee camp that he wants to be a doctor. This actor was born in Uganda and raised in Brixton (England). He's been acting there since 1993.
  * Ger Duany (""Isn't it Delicious"") plays Jeremiah, the most religious one: he never loses his Bible. Duany was born in South Sudan and was forced to be a child soldier in the civil war. On his second try, he escaped to Ethiopia when he was 14. He's been in Hollywood since 2004.
  * Emmanuel Jal (""Africa United"") is Paul, who rebels against Mamere remaining their chief in Kansas. This actor is another child soldier from southern Sudan who emerged as a hip hop star with an unusual message of reconciliation and peace. You can hear him on the soundtrack, too.
  * Reese Witherspoon (""Wild"") joins us about a third of the way into our story; Carrie is the ballsy caseworker who becomes an advocate for our trio. But she first must understand the magnitude of the cultural gap. This is NOT a glamor role for Witherspoon and she carries it off very well.
  * Corey Stoll (""This is Where I Leave You"") is Carrie's brother Jack. Together they run an employment agency but he still lives on the family farm. He thinks he might paint the porch but the Sudanese worry that there is no one guarding his cattle from lions.

I must applaud this PG-13 script. It's witty, wise, entertaining and exciting. The bloodshed in Sudan is off screen and hardships endured by the children during the trek are beautifully captured. We learn about a ""Good Lie,"" and enjoy the old joke about why the chicken crossed the road. We come to appreciate the differing points of view between the immigrants and the kind folks in Kansas, and how love of family is universal.

Be sure to watch all the way through the final credits because there are postscripts added about these durable people.",1413936000,13,2659,4.683870967741935
6399648,5,B00K2CI0HG,"This is a movie about Sudanese refugees who make it to America before 9/11 and constantly struggle to adjust to American culture and reunite with each other, working laboriously through employment situations and government red tape so they can reunite while pursuing the American dream.  Most of the movie takes place in America, after an eye-opening introductory section covering their escape from Sudan.  The Sudanese refugees are played by real Sudanese refugees and children of refugees, we learn at the end credits.  They do a fantastic job.  Their Christian faith runs into moral issues with how business is done in America, and they deal with identity crises and the sometimes unpredictable attitudes of those who are supposed to help them with employment.  The young Sudanese men are assigned to Kansas City, under the sponsorship of a brash lady who slowly grows in compassion toward them, played by Reese Witherspoon.  The young Sudanese woman whom they were close to gets assigned to Boston.  The most prolonged struggle in the movie has to do with their attempt to get her brought from Boston to Kansas City.

The way the movie flows kept me interested the entire time.  The refugee situation had gained my full attention within 5 minutes of the movie starting, and the refugees' innocence, honesty, and courage kept me interested in the outcome of their attempt to reunite.  The movie really got me thinking about the meaning of community vs. country.  The refugees consider themselves a small community of close friends rather than Sudanese or American.  The American dream is very important to these refugee characters, but all of them want to be reunited more than material prosperity.  In the end, one of them has to decide about how important the promise of wealth and the beauty of the American land are in his priorities, and the way it plays out is very moving.

I really like the humor, most of which is based on cultural dissimilarity.  That kind of humor worked really well in other fish-out-of-water comedies I've seen, like The Terminal (starring Tom Hanks as an eastern European immigrant stuck in an airport), the recently released Disney movie Million Dollar Arm (about creating a market for baseball in India and bringing the young champions to the United States), and Crocodile Dundee.  It works equally well in this movie.  One of the funny repeated jokes on The Good Lie is that they never cease to call 'em ""villages"" instead of towns or cities, and always use formal sentence construction when expressing gratitude.  It is at the same time funny and sad when they get exasperated responses from Americans because of their noble values.  It should make one reevaluate our demanding, accomplishment-based western values and consider whether the Sudanese refugees understand true success better.  Hard work and compassionate action go together for the Sudanese, but the Americans they meet can't understand that mentality.  There's a great quote at the end credits which goes something like, ""If you want to go fast, go alone.  If you want to go far, go together.""  The Reese Witherspoon character, who is into what she wants in life and feels she doesn't have time for the refugees, learns that to some extent over time.

I also found their attempts to keep stability through their Christian faith really poignant, because they can't seem to get stability in spite of having a regular prayer life and being strongly committed to each other and to principles of honesty and hard work.

The title ""The Good Lie"" has a connection to a plot element at the end which, despite objectively seeming bittersweet, is in fact very rewarding and satisfying.  The title won't make sense until you see the movie.  It's like what happens near the end of the movie War Horse when Albert gets the horse back because he was willing to give it up, or parables of Jesus about seeking virtue over pleasure for the benefit of the soul.  Trying to control and have everything you want leads you to misery, but being willing to make sacrifices opens up possibilities for greater blessings.  This is a movie that runs the gamut of emotions without leaving me drained by the end.  I love it when dramas leave me with a good feeling at the end that makes even the bittersweet elements feel rewarding because of the characters' growth.

I hope I've convinced you to try the movie!",1413072000,165,4385,4.901084010840108

__________________________________________________

Based on the true life stories of Sudan refugees who were dislocated during a Civil War in Sudan, director Philippe Falardeau presents a story of hardship and opportunity. The movie stars Reese Witherspoon, as an Employment Agency Rep, who takes in a group of refugees  Mamere, Jeremiah, Paul, and Abital  who have just arrived to America and are being placed in Kansas City. While trying to adjust to a new living and Americanize in the process it doesnt always come easy for them. With the help of Carrie (EAR), Mamere hopes to return a favor to one of his brothers, that without his bravery, could have cost them their lives and a second chance at life.

I was totally surprised by The Good Lie that by the end I couldn't believe how overlooked the film is with Annabelle and Gone Girl opening this weekend. The movie was advertised in theaters for a good amount but unfortunately is playing victim to other films that are getting the word of mouth; more specifically David Finchers Gone Girl. With that said, as more and more people spread the good word about this film it should gain more recognition.

The movie begins with a village that falls victim to the Civil War and the children are dispersed to safety while the parents sacrifice themselves. Having to journey through difficult climates and suffering through disease, and at times death, they manage to arrive at a refugee camp in Kenya. With hope dwindling, they manage to fly across the world to arrive in the United States. Located in Kansas City we find Mamere, Paul, and Jeremiah finding help in Carrie (Reese Witherspoon) who tries to find jobs for them and a begin a fresh start. Grief hangs over Mamere and his brothers from their ordeal in Sudan that prompts them to find answers if their brother Theo is still alive.

Youd imagine that Reese Witherspoon would be the main lead that has the spotlight for the entire movie. It wasn't to be. The refugees of Mamere (Arnold Oceng), Paul (Emmanuel Jal), and Jeremiah (Ger Duany) give amazing performances as they try to adjust to a new lifestyle while living in a totally new environment. From the moment they board the plane and arrive into the states you have compassion for them. It was fun to see how they react to new technologies and living standards that added a bit of humor to the film that dealt with a lot of traumatic events. While trying to land on their own two feet and become members of a productive society they find difficulties in thinking solo compared to caring for everyone in their village.

The enlightenment behind The Good Lie is provided with Mameres character and it essentially has to do with his brother Theo (Femi Oguns) who gives up his cover to save his fellow brothers and family. The sacrifice made for them comes into play later on in the film that brings the film full-circle. As the movie rolls along you can sense what would happen towards the end and does so with emotion.

Credit has to be given to Reese Witherspoon and her portrayal of Carrie who ends up caring deeply for Mamere and his family. She even goes out of her way to house Mameres sister who was located in Boston so they may be together. There was a lot of heart in Carrie that doesnt come across right away when the refugees first arrived. But as she watches them struggle to adjust with jobs and handling their emotions from their past theres an urgency to make things right and give them a fair chance. As minor as her roles is, when shes on screen you cant help but enjoy her presence.

In closing, there was a telling quote at the end of the movie that summarizes the tribulations and sacrifices Mamere and company made to get to America. The quote comes from an African proverb and goes as follows,If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together Director Philippe Falardeau should be recognized for his efforts here in The Good Lie as it shows with great performances by its cast.",1412726400,26,4041,4.648459383753502

What I like best is that we can understand better the immigrant/refugee experience in entering a new culture. It's so hard but we can't imagine it if we don't have any insights.

Reese's character is appropriately clueless and helpful, but best of all is not the ""white savior"" that other films have made the mistake of featuring (think ""Freedom Writers"" ugh). She is tangential to the story, not the center. Thank you, writers and director!

You will love the four central characters and I dare you not to cry at least one tear at the end. SO WORTH IT.",1460073600,,580,4.504761904761905

6399989,3,B00K2CI0HG,"It's so worthy that it seems churlish to be less than impressed by it - but it takes the soft approach to a dreadful situation to make it palatable for American audiences. And in doing so, the power it could have had becomes syrupy. The Sudanese characters are all wise, warm, and ultra sensitive and all the Americans are wasteful and breathtakingly naieve. Which is not  the case in the real world. Reese Witherspoon is as terrific as she usually is, but it feels like a lecture. I thought it was interesting that some of the Sudanese cast were once child soldiers - and that puts a whole new level of complexity on the film which just isn't there.",1458950400,,650,4.46218487394958

6400144,5,B00K2CI0HG,"This is a pretty nice story, if you're expecting Witherspoon to have a lot of screen time, you'll be disappointed, she doesn't even appear in the movie until half way through and even when she appears every now and then, she is just a supporting role for the main Sudanese characters' storylines.  Saying that the Sudanese men (they weren't actors, they were mostly actual former Lost Boys and the ones that weren't were related to those that were), do a fine and entertaining job, as do their younger versions of their characters played by African kids (although it was mostly filmed in South Africa).  The first half of the film is a survival tale, how many of our group of Sudanese child travellers will make it to safety after their village was strafed from the air and attacked by soldiers on foot ?  The second is along the lines of a Coming to America, Crocodile Dundee, culture clash/fish out water type movie where the refugees discover a phone is not an alarm, what beds are (even though they had beds in the refuge camp hospital where one of them worked as a doctor), that Americans waste a lot of food and why the chicken crossed the road.  The second part certainly seemed less authentic than the first but was still very entertaining. The second half, especially the last part of the movie which gives the film its title was very predictable.  But that by no means doesn't mean you won't enjoy the journey there.  The second half also though barely touches the trauma from being a child in a warzone, combined with the lack of professional help by the hosts, with only one character getting a bit stressed and damaging a phone booth, whereas unfortunately we know some Sudanese refugees were so mentally damaged that people died from their stressed actions.

The Good Lie though is a good watch, you'll enjoy it, and also watch the previews where you learn those African kids actually did approach those big cats and were apparently more scared of the water in the crossing river scene than that one.",1439683200,,2014,4.656338028169014

6400248,2,B00K2CI0HG,"I'm all for compassion and helping children in all the many situations and circumstances. I had mixed feelings about the film. First, I want to say, for children in any country to be left to cope with the unfathomable evils of surviving the massacring of entire villages which left them fend for themselves and have their lives still threatened by gunfire, starvation, the extreme elements, sickness, and God knows what else...as the Sudanese children were left to face...is unconscionable. All children in any warring country are put in the most impossible situations.

I wonder, though, the rationale of transplanting anyone from their homelands to ""come to America"" to adapt or fail trying to. For all the kind heartedness and well meaning of those church organizations who brought these young men and young women over America...then separating family members because it wouldn't be seemly to allow brothers and sisters to live together, so of course put them in entirely different states...because, heck, that makes sense when they have survived the most hellish circumstances but can't live in the same apartment ""because it's small"" and where would...etc, etc, etc.  Even well meaning good hearted people can be such enormous idiots.

Then there is the requirement they MUST have a job immediately. When our own young people can't get work, sure give people brought from other countries and give the few menial jobs meant for American teenagers to others. That's the American Christian way I guess. Rob from Peter to pay Paul. With lives.

Then requiring them to even pay back their plane tickets on the wages of a grocery market stock boy and other such things as that...when we all know that one can barely survive sharing the rent and food and still pay back all that money.

So all in all, as well meaning as it was ... and I do get that if an American church doesn't have a project that involves moving people from one country to America so they can feel like they saved them good and proper, then they are left with what? Bingo? Bake sales. I don't know. I just took issue with the logic of this and every other major ""salvation"" effort. I surely see the need. I surely recognize the thoughtfulness. But I don't see any actually thinking involved.

Personally, I would think that all the money that went into bringing them here to America would have been much better spent and actually invested in creating a REALLY nice village for them out of the same refugee camp they were taken out of. Build cottages...schools...medical facilities...and train those who grew up in that camp to be leaders of the future to their own village of their own people so that atrocities like that which destroyed their villages and killed their families don't happen again. Teach them how to be masters of their own destinies, their own future, in their own country. Build a future for them there. They would have ALL been happier in the short run and would have become leaders of the future Sudan...and any place else in the long run. And they would be problem solvers for others in dire distress. Taking some and leaving behind so many was only to make the church people feel better about it. What about those left behind.

The boy who sent his brother to America on his visa chose to stay in Sudan and work in a hospital. THERE he would certainly be of a service to people who truly needed him. That was the best part of the story. That was the good lie part.

The rest was hype as we have it spoon fed to us, Hollywood style.

I went to a church a long, long time ago that sent missionaires to New Guinea and cannibals killed and ate one of them. I remember that one of the ladies in the group that was getting more volunteers to go back to New Guinea suggested maybe to bring some cannibals back to Pennsylvania (where I was living at the time) and civilize them. That is how the minds of some folks work. I don't get it. I didn't go back to THAT church again. They don't think clearly sometimes. In that case, not at all. BTW, nobody raised their hand to volunteer to take the eaten fellow's place.

So, no...I didn't particularly like this film, although the actors who played the Sudanese children and the young men and woman they grew up to be did a fine convincing performance in the film. And after the film I did pray, like I usually do, for the children of the world to outlive the monsters who tend to hurt them.",1435017600,,4419,4.617834394904459
6400249,4,B00K2CI0HG,"This was a very good, clean and uplifting movie. It was nice to see religion be a part of the characters life without any disparagement. I like Reese Witherspoon but am not sure she was really right for this role, just not ""warm"" enough.",1434931200,,237,4.409090909090909
6400250,5,B00K2CI0HG,"Intelligently based on a concept from HUCKLEBERRY FINN  that a lie is ok to tell if it saves someone (the book reference it is Huck telling a lie about Jim to save him), this film could not be more timely suited for release on DVD, video, or even in a re-release in the theaters, so critical are racial issues/conflicts at this time. If more people could experience the beauty in the spirit of the Lost Boys of Sudan there would likely be a stronger push toward putting an end to racially motivated killings that spread across the media daily.

The film takes place in Africa first, during the Sudanese civil wars of the 1980s. In a horrifyingly realistic fashion we observe the massacre in Sudan. Four Sudanese children are orphaned after their village is massacred in the Second Sudanese Civil War. Consequently, they make an arduous and dangerous trek through the plains, enduring hardship, death and sacrifice until they reach safety in a refugee camp in Ethiopia. Years later, these youths are among 3600 selected for resettlement in America, only to have the one girl among them sent to Boston, while the three boys must to make a new life in Kansas City, Missouri. Together, these young men must adjust to an alien culture even as the emotional baggage of their past haunts them. However, these newcomers, and their new friends like employment counselor Carrie Davis (Reese Witherspoon in a role even better than her Oscar role in WILD), strive to understand each other in this new home, as they make peace with their histories in a challenge that will change all their lives. The staggeringly beautiful manner n which these young people honor every one they meet with manners that many of us are beginning to see as a lost art along with their faith and perseverance in the face of physical odds in Africa and political nonsense in America makes each of the actors radiant  Arnold Oceng as Mamere, Ger Duany as Jeremiah, Kuoth Wiel as Abital, Emmauel Jal as Paul, and Femi Oguns as Theo  each of whom is either a refugee or the child of a refugee from Sudan. Actors Corey Stoll, Sarah Baker and Lindsey Garrett  also deserve mention.

The Writer is Margaret Nagle an the director is Philippe Falardeau. This is a stunning cinematic achievement. Grady Harp, June 15",1434844800,,2272,4.739240506329114

This movie shows the triumph of human spirit, especially of children, who are forced to leave their homes in Sudan due to murderous attacks on their villages. They lose many loved ones in their village and on their journey. They make a new family amongst themselves due to the traumas they endure trying to survive a journey lasting hundreds of miles, only to spend years in refugee camps waiting on lotteries that allow them to find new homes in other countries. This film focuses on a few who make it to America and their struggle to fit in our culture and make lives for themselves. Reese Witherspoon is excellent as the employment counselor who has no idea of what these young men have experienced, but is so moved by working with them that she actually bothers to try and find out. Her life and the lives of others who encounter these young men are forever changed, and for the better. The film captures the love and struggles shared by these children, and the sacrifices they are willing to make for each other.

I felt that much information was left out about the struggles of the boys who thought that America was going to be the land of milk and honey for them, and it turned out to be quite the opposite. These boys came over here not ever hearing about things like deodorant and had to be taught the American culture that so many of us here take for granted as if 'everyone' around the world knows about 'this'. They were hoping to make a lot of money to send back home to their families. But getting jobs while trying to pay for rent and food was more difficult (and expensive) than they imagined. I wasn't sure if you didn't know a lot of the true back story, would you totally get it in this 2 hour movie? Regardless, the story is touching and all the actors did a great job.

Given that Reese Witherspoon's picture is plastered all over the advertising, I was afraid that it might end up being some cheesy story about a white woman who does good deeds-isn't-she-so-nice.  But the story focused a lot on the struggles of the African refugees, including a lot of what they went through before arriving in the United States.  And when they come to America, most of the story is still very focused on them moving themselves through their journeys, and not about the people who help them.

Although the story is a touching one of loss, perseverance, and the isolation of moving to a strange country, it wasn't depressing.

6400400,5,B00K2CI0HG,"Thank you to Alcon Entertainment for sending us this film to review!

I knew nothing about this film when I sat down to watch it, other than the title, which intrigued me.  Telling a lie is rarely a good thing.  Depending on the circumstances a single lie can contain the power to completely destroy your life, not to mention collateral damage caused to others.  Other lies, commonly referred to as ""white lies"" are generally considered unharmful, focusing on keeping social interactions civil or inoffensive.  ""Does this dress make my bum look too big?""  {Slight pause - often without even looking at said dress or it's effect on one's spouse's bum} ""NO! Of COURSE not!  You look great!""  The repercussions of a ""white lie"" may be minor (like having an annoyed spouse for an evening), but that does not mean telling one is ""good.""

So what kind of lie is a good one?  The film answers this question brilliantly: The kind that saves other people's lives at the risk of your own.  A couple of biblical references to this come to mind immediately.  The most notable is in Exodus Chapter 1 where Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt sees his slave population growing more numerous than his ability to effectively control.  His solution: infanticide.  All baby boys of the Hebrews are sentenced to death by exposure.  Well, the midwives (ladies who are in charge of overseeing births, like Lamaze coaches and nurses combined) take issue with Pharaoh's solution.  But what's a powerless midwife to do when faced with the choice between disobeying the ruler, who will execute you for disobedience as callously as he kills babies, and doing what they know to be the righteous thing?  You lie.  The midwives tell Pharaoh that the Hebrew ladies are so tough that they pop those baby boys out before they even get there.

Woman, ""Honey, my water just broke!""
Man, ""What do I do?""
Woman, ""GET THE MIDWIFE!""
Man, ""But... if it's a boy, Pharaoh said,""
Woman, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW!""
Man, ""Alright! Be right back! Hang on dear!""
Man runs down the street, frantic, to his Lamaze coach's house, retrieves her, and they run back.  He is gone a total of fifteen minutes.
Man, ""Honey, the midwife is here!""
Woman, ""You lazy bum!  You took too long!  I had to push this little guy out all by myself!  It was ten whole minutes of agony!""
Man,""Sorry Lamaze, but I guess we don't need your help today.  Sorry for waking you up at two in the morning.""

So, the midwives tell Pharaoh a reasonably obvious lie, one which is almost unbelievable.  But, the Bible says that Pharaoh was duped by this story, and that God BLESSED the midwives for lying... or rather for telling a good lie.  Not good as in believable, effective, or clever, but good in intent.  A lie intended to save the lives of the Hebrew baby boys, at the risk of their own lives.

Many other examples of such lies could be made.  Examples of this are plentiful during the Holocaust for instance.  ""The Good Lie,"" tells a story of one such event during the Second Sudanese Civil War.

In this story, several Sudanese children are orphaned after their village is massacred. They are Theo, the oldest and their leader, his younger brother Mamere, their sister Abital, and two other villagers Paul and Jeremiah.  They band together and make a long journey through the desert enduring hardship, dodging the rebel forces, and nearly dying until they reach safety in a refugee camp in Kenya.  Along the way Theo tells a good lie.  They are stumbled upon by the enemy soldiers while the group was sleeping in the plain.  The leader's younger brother Mamere is seen briefly before he hides in the grass.  In order to save his younger brother, Theo stands up and surrenders to the soldiers.  He is hauled off by them, and presumed killed, but the soldiers don't find the rest of his group because he lied and told them he was alone.

Years later, these youths are among 3,600 refugees selected for resettlement in America.  The four remaining survivors of their village petition to have them all stay together since they are basically family.  Once in America, they are told that they have to split up and their sister Abital is sent to Boston, while the three surviving boys must make a new life in Kansas City.

Together, Mamere, Paul, and Jeremiah must adjust to a new and different culture, go to school, get jobs, and try to reconnect with their sister even as the emotional pain of losing Theo haunts them.  Mamere, who feels responsible for his brother's presumed death learns of a good lie in school from a literature class studying ""Huckleberry Finn.""  In that instance, Huck tells a lie to save Jim from slave hunters.  This example of a good lie inspires Mamere and helps him realize that the guilt he is feeling is not right.  It was not his choice, it was his brother Theo's.  The lie that Theo told to save him and the rest of his group was a good one to tell.

Overall, the film was moving, gave the viewer an emotional connection to the characters, and presented the historical atrocities of the Sudanese Civil War in honest terms.  The actors who portray the Sudanese refugees are all actually Sudanese refugees who became actors (as opposed to the machinists and grocery store clerks they become in the film).  The American actors are Reese Witherspoon who plays Carrie Davis, the boys' job placement agent and Corey Stole who plays Jack, Carrie's boss.  Both of these characters are initially apathetic to the plight of the Sudanese refugees, but eventually help them adjust to American culture and by the end of the film they adopt a sympathetic posture towards their situation.
Carrie's change is the most abrupt.  When first introduced to her, she is abrasive and unlikable, selfish, and easily put-off by anything that remotely inconveniences her.  By the end of the film she orchestrates reuniting the boys with their sister Abital by sponsoring Abital to live in her own home.  The self-sacrifice she makes in order to help those three boys was extremely uncharacteristic of her early character and clearly represents the change that occurred in her heart to cause her to help the people that were previously just an annoyance to her.

The film is rated PG-13 for violence, language and drug use.  I would concur that it deserves a PG-13 rating based on those factors.
I enjoyed the film a lot, and would recommend it if you like dramas, or movies with a positive message of self-sacrificial love.",1430956800,,6445,4.7309417040358746

6400402,4,B00K2CI0HG,"Though top-billed, Reese Witherspoon is not really the star of The Good Lie, a based-on-the-truth drama about a group of Sudanese orphans who had to flee their country during the Second Sudanese Civil War. According to the film, these refugee children are called the Lost Boys of Sudan and as part of US government/UN program some of them resettle in America.

So The Good Lie opens with the childrens harrowing experiences in Africa in 1983. Having lost their parents during the militants attack, Theo (Femi Oguns), Mamere (Arnold Oceng) and Abital (Kuoth Wiel) leave their village and head for Ethiopia. Later brothers Jeremiah (Ger Duany) and Paul (Emmanuel Jal) join them. Four of them manage to arrive to the Kakuma camp. (Some of the characters are played by non-professional actors, who were once refugees and child soldiers themselves.)

Thirteen years later, the four refugees start a new life in America as part of the resettlement program to the US. Reese Witherspoon plays a Kansas City employment counselor Carrie Davis, who helps them find jobs and get used to the ways of life in a new place.

Though the films story is often told with a comedy touch, the subject matter itself is a very serious one. Director Philippe Falardeau (Monsieur Lazhar) wisely avoids preachy messages or graphic violence, but the pains and joys of the characters are real. Perhaps the films second half needs some more unique angle, and the good lie that the title refers to is too good to be true, but The Good Lie is still worth watching for its important subject matter.",1430784000,,1565,4.87593984962406

There was a scene or two where we needed to zip past what happened, but all in all it describes horrors in other countries that we can't/won't ever be able to imagine here. It describes the struggles of refugee's coming to the United States before September 11th, and how policies changed after September 11th to make it harder for refugee's to come here.

6400511,3,B00K2CI0HG,"I wanted to love this movie. It's a great subject and the plight of refugee children needs more attention. But unfortunately the movie doesn't do justice to its subject matter - while the children, as they wander North Africa, and the young adults who eventually get to america face great difficulties the film never makes successful drama from their situation, nor does it really draw us into the characters so that we care for them. Victories come easily and obstacles and difficulties are either overcome, or succumbed to, with little emotion and no sense of the enormity of events. Even the 'good lie' of the title seems to unfold by rote. This is the fault of the script, not of the actors - everyone does a great job and it is great to see real refugees being given the opportunity to star in the story of their people.",1429488000,,825,4.581081081081081

6400606,5,B00K2CI0HG,"What a powerful good movie.
To much is taken for granted by those of us that are born here, for me I again am reminded of all that I have.

I know only a little about the 2nd Sudan Civil War but you don't need to know anything to see the victimization of innocent children by brutal and heartless men. Events like this happen all over the globe.
If violence again children bothers you (and it should) some of this is very difficult to watch.
Once past those initial scenes it is a movie that should be seen.",1428278400,,507,4.173469387755102

6400623,4,B00K2CI0HG,"While Reese Witherspoon is the headliner here, she has but a small supportive role.  As it should be.  Movies like this don't get big audiences even if they deal with important issues of the day.  Actors like Witherspoon tend to provide a bit of a draw.  Fortunately the filmmakers keep their focus on the lives of 4 refugees from the Sudanese civil war that began in 1983.

After a village is wiped out by marauding soldiers, a few youngsters manage to escape alive.  The oldest named Theo, appears to be about 12 and as the oldest son of the tribal chief, assumes the role.  He knows that his father had told him to escape to Ethiopia if the time came.  Theo leads the small group, which includes his sister and 2 brothers, across the African plain.  Hundreds of miles later, instead of finding potential refuge, they find people marching the other way as Ethiopia has its own war going on.  Eventually, some 750 miles later, the group arrives in Kenya which has established a camp on the border.  One young brother succumbs to the ordeal.  Theo, captured earlier is replaced by younger brother Mamere as the de facto leader.

Years pass, but finally Mamere (Arnold Oceng), his sister Abital (Kuoth Wiel), tribal friend Paul (Emmanuel Jal) and Jeremiah (Ger Duany), who they met on the journey, are accepted to travel to the U. S. where they will live and work.  The 3 young men go to Kansas City, but in a last minute change, Abital must go to Boston.  Witherspoon plays Carrie, who along with her boss Jack (Corey Stoll), is given responsibility to find work for the men.  We see a bit of Carrie's back story but she never becomes the focus of the film.

Director Philippe Falardeau and writer Margaret Nagle keep the focus on the 3 men and their adaptation to America and its way of life, all very strange to the men as you can imagine.  Resettlement is difficult, especially as they always remain concerned about Abital's welfare.  When word comes of the possibility that oldest brother Theo (Femi Oguns) may be alive, a guilt-plagued Mamere decides to travel back to Kenya to find out.  The 4 leads were actually refugees from the Sudan and two were child-soldiers.  So while they didn't actually portray the real people in the film, they give a sense of authenticity to their roles.  The film is funny at times (Mamere asks about Lions being around when touring a ranch), heart-tugging and still uplifting.  The film is beautifully shot by Ronald Plante and deserves a look.

The Blu ray transfer has a 1080p video resolution with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 vs. the original 1.85:1.  The colors are very good especially during the early scenes in Africa.  Flesh tones appear accurate, black levels on deep and the detail is excellent.  I detected no compression flaws either.  The audio comes in the form of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and is equally good.  Clear dialog is evident throughout.  While the supplemental speakers aren't jumping, their use is clearly audible and provide a nice transition between the Africa scenes and those from Kansas City.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras are limited to some deleted scenes and a production featurette.",1428105600,2,3199,4.739130434782608

6400626,4,B00K2CI0HG,"Touching story of the Sudanese refugees... The movie clearly does a good job by pointing out the tragedy that happened there less than a decade ago. I honestly had no idea about such a brutal fighting that claimed the lives of 2 million people until this movie. The plot is well organized and the script as well as acting is at high standard. It starts in a village back in Africa, which got raided by soldiers for who knows why reason and a bunch of kids escape and go through a harsh test for survival.

Drought, starvation, encounter with conflicts and wild animals are a few of the many that had been waiting for them. Some die on their way to the unknown but four of them make it to a refugee camp first and from there, by chance to USA. All have signs of post traumatic stress syndrome and on top of that they have to go through another test for survival in the so called  'land of opportunity' Not being aware of even the simple elements of the basic day to day life, they luck out by coming across a soft hearted employement consultant ( Reese Witherspoon).

The movie powerfully demonstrates how the lions of savannah transform into the lions of competitive life in the US and survival in both cases, not only require efforts and skills but also luck.

The reason I docked a star from my rating is that despite the strength in plotline some events or even personalities are rather unrealistic and the connections are partially loose. I don't know it is may be cinematography or directing, but somehow I liked Blood diamond or Hotel Rwanda, a little more than this movie... Yet still a very good use of my time...

So many parts of the world today are experiencing their own holocausts.  Twenty or thirty years ago we thought such evil would end after seeing what happened in Europe during WWII.

It's not an emotional tear jerker, but does tug at your heart strings when you think about what the kids actually had to go through.  The story probably could have been told in a more touching way, but I think it's a decent treatment of the subject without any over-the-top, sappy or preachy scenes.  The humorous moments make it enjoyable.  I wish Hollywood made more movies like this one.  I may end up buying it.",1426636800,,484,4.5813953488372094

With that being said I have my political views which makes it personal and that I might not be the best person to rate this movie. I would say watch it because there are things to be learned. Personal, the united states needs to close our country and help our own people. We now have over 49% of people receiving some kind of government assistance and a real of unemployment at around 28% with middle income decreasing at an alarming rate. A deficient government and growing debt that far exceed our revenue. What future will our children have and at this rate, we will not be able to help anyone as a country in the coming future. Some times our best efforts really aren't the best or good for many as this movie brings to life. America needs help and only the people can change that now .",1426204800,,962,4.291208791208791

6400790,5,B00K2CI0HG,"I was tempted to go back and give it 4 stars because of a possible comparison to some of the hugely amazing movies that are produced. I gave it 5 because of the impact of the story. Over the years, I don't usually go back and watch a story twice for quite a long time. But, I would watch this one again in the near future. Based in recent history, this is a true and very touching story about young children who watch their parents get shot, their village ravaged, and then travel over 500 miles on foot to freedom, escaping those who would kill them because of their faith. It is amazing to me that the youth of that country would have to face such extreme trauma and be able to survive, moving on to do well in their lives when given the opportunity. My 33 year old son, in a way, accidentally rented this movie and told his father and me that we really needed to rent it and watch it. He kept pushing and one day sat down with me and insisted that I watch it. Well worth the push, especially since this is going on in Africa at this time in our lives, 3/10/15. I do not like to watch wars and killings; but, I was able to get through this one due to the interest in the children and how they were settled in the United States as refugees. To a small degree it reminded me of the movie ""The Inn Of the Sixth Happiness"" played by Ingrid Bergman based on a true story of a missionary woman who lead hundreds of children out of the wars in China.",1425945600,,1445,4.091549295774648

Kind simpleness next to abject cruelty, wild emotion  next to amazing stoicism, deep understanding next to willful ignorance.
This I can say about this movie, I wept without any attempt to restrain at this depiction of the lost boys. I would have gladly given my life in exchange for theirs. It has occurred to me as I approach the so called golden years, that to throw in my lot with such a desperate people in a desperate land would be a  good way to go out.
I am very thankful to the director/producer for allowing the clear Christian faith of these lost boys to be shown. It could have been covered up or passed over as was the Muslim background of the murderers.

Although not based on the true story of the Lost boys of Sudan, this movie does an excellent job at telling the hardships of the Sudanese refugees and their struggles trying to find a way out of the refugee camps.  Although Witherspoon gets top billing in this movie, it is the actors who are actual Sudanese refugees that steal the show.  You could tell that they played their roles from their hearts and it was brilliant.  The humor and innocence of the characters shined throughout and really made me feel for the characters.  The humor was well done and fit well into the movie without being over the top and silly.  This movie even with the tragedies portrayed has a really uplifting message that even with the bittersweet ending brought a tear to my eye.  This is a movie that will make you smile, laugh, think and maybe even cry a little.  This is a well written movie with a smart title that portrays a meaningful point that sometimes a good lie can be a meaningful one.

The subsequent time spent in a refugee shelter, and then eventually in America, is another good window into what it might be like to participate in a long life of diaspora, followed by immigration to a new country for refuge.
The final struggles are unique, heartwarming, and thought provoking. A final twist in the end lends some needed surprise.

6401058,5,B00K2CI0HG,"What a great film! I've read several memoirs written by survivors of the second Sudanese civil war and this movie is very true to them. Some of the scenes seemed to come right from their pages. Three of the four excellent actors who play the film's main (adult) characters are survivors of Sudan's civil war, contributing to the film's believability. The fourth actor is the son of a Sudanese refugee.

This film deals with a horrific era in world history--the genocide of the southern Sudanese people--but it avoids being gruesome. While the details of what the genocide's victims endured and succumbed to must be heard, this film will encourage many viewers to seek out complementary sources of information to educate them further.

""The Good Lie"" focuses on the bonds forged between child survivors of genocide which last them through a harrowing journey to safety, many years at a refugee camp, and through a difficult adjustment period as newcomers to the United States. Their tenacity, faith, and optimism--in spite of all they have endured--is inspiring and heart-warming. The situations the characters face when they arrive in the U.S. are often amusing and always thought-provoking. You may be surprised at how good a film about such a difficult topic can make you feel.",1423094400,,1279,5.056872037914692

6401077,4,B00K2CI0HG,"I didn't expect to be sniffling my way through most of this movie - after it finished, I started looking for more information about the history of Sudan and what had happened. I was glad that the movie (mostly) avoided being overly sentimental and also that Reese Witherspoon's character was not the focus of the story - the unknown actors (many of them real-life refugees) were the real stars of this movie.  It was also surreal seeing the donated T-shirts they wore in the refugee camps - like the one for the Alabama autism conference. It definitely makes you think about donating all the ""throwaway"" stuff in your closet, because someone really could use it. It also makes you think about the definition of ""family."" But be warned, it was a little hard to watch young children suffering.",1422403200,4,791,4.731884057971015

I watched it last night, and when I woke this morning, my first thoughts were of gratitude. It took me a few minutes to remember why I woke feeling so grateful, then I remembered the movie, and tears came again. The impact on me was so great that I felt compelled to go online and donate to ""The Good Lie"" UNICEF fund. It was a beautifully done movie. The focus stayed true; on the Sudanese refugees and their story and didn't turn into an ""Americans come to save the day"" film. This film depicts the worst of human beings, as well as the best.

Reese Witherspoon is lovely (as always) but not the focus of the film and nor should she be.  The entire cast is outstanding.  And I have to say the way Americans run their businesses and our lack of manners, was spot on.

6401106,3,B00K2CI0HG,A lot of people found it slow but I thought it moved at a pace that allowed us to know the characters. Fortunately the film didn't get into the conflict of religions which of course provides fuel for many conflicts in Africa and the Middle & further East but focused on the specifics of these few characters. What it lacked was a more in-depth showing of the challenge of walking so far and secondarily of the daily lives of peoples.,1421539200,2,433,4.425

6401108,4,B00K2CI0HG,Surprisingly good! I rented movie because I had my grandnephew and his parent's in for the evening so I needed something that was not animated and not violent that we all could enjoy. The story was something we had heard about in the news but the actors who played the refugees were convincing especially when they were seeing and experiencing something new. Loved the ending although my niece and I were so crying that we missed most of the dialogue. Have the rental for 30days so I'll be watching again.,1421539200,,505,4.622222222222222

6401112,2,B00K2CI0HG,"I felt this movie could have shown more of the lifestyle and real emotion around people adjusting to the USA , it was too surface and shallow in that respect and lacked real emotion. Far too much emphasis on the lives as refugees and not enough on how they lost everything actually moving to the states as well. Even the implications of separating a family were glossed over . It was almost like the culture barrier existed even in the understanding of two different cultures , and any connection was really kept on a superficial token level. Being African myself, the part of Africa showing african lifestyle etc, lacked the complexity of africa itself and did not delve in to the lack these people must have felt upon arriving in the usa in terms of culture and sense of family. The acting was good, but it was almost like we were kept out of the real emotions of all the actors hearts - it felt too hollywood for me.",1421366400,5,919,4.443786982248521

This movie is about 4 brothers and a sister who were lucky enough to get out and come here with the aid of UNICEF.  There is also (sponsored by these movie makers) ""TheGoodLifeFund.org"" where you can go and donate to help those still in Sudan refugee camps.

I thought the movie was well performed (actual Sudanese refugees) and presented... I liked all the background information and an opportunity to see the world from their perspective.  It was heartbreaking and yet, joyful.

I think movies like this are important and although, it's presented as entertainment, there is value in the subtle consciousness raising simply by watching... to help us keep perspective about the benefits of our life here in the states and to remind us that our world paradigm is not a global ideal.  We are a melting pot and we need to learn to better honor different cultures and enjoy the value they can and do add to our communities.  Reese Witherspoon's role is small, yet, powerful and I think she reminds us to be humble about our good fortunes, to keep ourselves better informed/educated on world news and to volunteer/help where we can, what we can and as often as we can.",1420156800,,1066,4.867403314917127

6401288,5,B00K2CI0HG,"My kids recently had the extraordinary privilege of a visit in their classroom by real-life reformed boy-soldier Ishmael Beah. We all sat on the floor and conversed for over an hour. I recommend you read his books ""A long way Gone"" and ""Radiance of Tomorrow"". While this movie used a somewhat tired narrative device (the Whitherspoon character in the movie that goes from actively indifferent to a ""guardian angel""), the depiction of the refugee's life seems very much in line with what Ishmael Beah describes of his experience (different conflict; different part of Africa; but sadly same story) and, overall, reasonably authentic.

I am not sure they made it clear at the beginning of the movie, but I think it is good to know at the outset that the three african actors are, in real life, real refugees (their story was, in a sense, even worse, because they were turned into boy-soldiers). Their performance in this film is stellar and very moving.

WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH YOUR OWN TEENAGERS. It might help them gain some perspective on any First World problem they may have. Any problem we have in the US is nothing compared to what these people have worked through. Any sacrifice we are ever likely to make is nothing compared to the sacrifices the characters make in this movie.

These refugee victims have a huge heart,  they are willing to work hard, and have lived through atrocities I can only imagine. If I were to improve on The Good Lie, I would show more about the refugee camp and their years before coming to America. Garbage day was the kids favorite day of the week for they found scrap food in the dump to eat. Meager existence in the refugee camp.

The acting was very well done and I thought it amazing that the Refugees were played by real Refugees or their ancestors.

When they get the news that they will be one of the lucky ones to make the trip to America they are ecstatic. They are met by job counselor Carrie (Witherspoon) who helps them find employment. Even with their improved life they find it hard to adjust and feelings of guilt begin to effect Mamere (Oceng). This is a movie where the trailer does not really do justice to the movie. Judging by the trailer it seems like a Blind Side type more starring Reese Witherspoon. The reality is that the movie is super depressing and Witherspoon only has a small part. I think she is in it and on the cover in order for marketing purposes only. As far as the movie goes though this is very very good and worth seeing but not really one you can watch over and over. Much like Hotel Rwanda the movie is very important and the fact that this is a true story makes it that much more emotional but this isn't a movie to watch for entertainment value only. Overall, a movie I recommend but do not expect a happy movie that you want to watch over and over. I give it a B+.",1419292800,3,1293,4.281632653061225
6401413,5,B00K2CI0HG,"The countdown to Christmas is on - there's a flurry of buying, a plethora of ads and a huge sense of urgency to be 'ready'. But at this time of the year, I think we also need to slow down and think just how fortunate we are and of those who have not been so blessed, to celebrate the joy in being alive and to remember the best gifts cannot be unwrapped.

The Good Lie starring Reese Witherspoon releases today. And it's a movie you need to watch.

In my place of work, I have met and had conversations with Sudanese refugees. Their stories are horrific, but need to be told, so the world knows. The Good Lie tells the story of some of the lost boys of Sudan.

Who are the lost boys? In 1983 civil war broke out in Sudan - approximately 2.5 million people were killed - and thousands of children were left orphaned. Over 20,000 children trekked over 1000 miles, looking for safety. Ethiopia was not the safe haven they had been told of, so instead they journeyed to Kenya - and the Kakuma refugee camp.

The Good Lie is the story of three boys and one girl, who spent 13 years in the camp and were then sponsored to relocate in the US. Witherspoon plays Carrie,  a hardened job counselor whose life become inextricably entwined with these four.

Oh boy, my emotions ran the gamut on this movie - horror at the war, fear for the children, hope for a new life and sadness for those still in the camps, awe at the courage shown and joy. I laughed out loud in many parts (the chicken crossing the road joke gets new life) and I cried many times. (The reason behind the title will break your heart.)

 The Good Lie lets us see North American life through the eyes of a newcomer as they try to learn and navigate the rules, regulations, customs and everyday life we take for granted, but still live by their own core values. I think one of the most telling scenes was when Jeremiah, one of the four, is sent out to throw away the 'old food' to make room for the 'new food' at his grocery stocking job. He helps a homeless woman pick through the food destined for the dumpster - and is promptly berated by the boss. Jeremiah's reaction is one we should all have.

Witherspoon is one of my favourite actresses. She was perfect in this film. The actors playing the four (and their younger selves) all had personal ties to the Sudan either as refugees themselves or children of refugees.

Sadly, I don't think this movie has received the press it should have while at the theatres. It's a five star, thumbs up watch for this viewer. If you're looking for a film that celebrates the human spirit and that will resonate with you after the credits have rolled, The Good Lie is for you.",1419292800,43,2672,4.326

6401421,5,B00K2CI0HG,"""The Good Lie"" is a fictional account of the true, horrifying ordeal of the Lost Boys of Sudan in the 1980s and 90s. Caught in a violent civil war in which the Sudanese People's Liberation Army killed their parents and threatened them with addiction or death, many boys and girls walked hundreds of miles to a refugee camp in Kenya. Fifteen years later, a humanitarian effort by Catholic charities and other religious groups would bring 3,600 lost boys, as well as girls, to America to provide a new life in an alien but far less hostile environment.

Carrie Davis (Reese Witherspoon) is a job counselor Kansas City, Missouri, who helps the young men acclimate to their new environment and lifestyle. She tries to find them jobs but it's tough, since everyday things such as light switches and telephones are brand new to them.

The story is gripping. The brutality encountered by the boys is shown in graphic, disturbing detail, but their instinct for survival and determined ability to make something of their shattered lives is inspiring. The film features real-life Sudanese refugees Arnold Oceng, Kuoth Wiel, Ger Duany, and rapper Emmanual Jal, who were former child soldiers and Lost Boys, and Femi Oguns (BBC's ""The Casualty"").

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, digital copy, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1418860800,5,1352,5.081081081081081

6401433,4,B00K2CI0HG,"Well, THIS one was a pleasant surprise. What set me against this enjoyable, poignant, and well-acted film, before I had even seen it? I think it was the marketing. That cheesy trailer that made the whole thing look like the White Person saves the day, a Crocodile Dundee remake with innocent and childishly earnest African villagers all wide-eyed and in awe of suburban America. And yeah, my fears were not wholly unfounded. The Good Lie does go a step too far with stereotypical characters. In particular, Mamere, Jeremiah, and Paul, three&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Boys-of-Sudan/dp/0820328839/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Boys of Sudan</a>&nbsp;fleeing atrocities in South Sudan, can come across as cliched in their politeness and general genial ignorance of Western life.

But The Good Lie transcends its flaws to deliver a moving, engaging, funny and warm experience for all. It's really two movies in one. The first movie is a powerful and eye-opening look at the war and strife in Sudan, and indeed many African countries like it. Without shocking or scaring a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Diamond/dp/B000OLRH1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Diamond</a>, the film manages to make the atrocities and hardships of African guerilla warfare and the subsequent refugee flood make an impact on the viewer. The first chapter of the film also showcases some great child performances, hot and sandy African vistas, and a compelling display of childhood bonding and leadership.

The latter majority of the film details the lives of a family of Sudanese refugees - Mamere, the responsible leader who wants to be a doctor, Jeremiah, a calm man who is deeply religious, Paul, a fiery young man with a warm heart, and Abital, their responsible sister - and their struggles to live in America, forge a new life for themselves, and reunite their family. Their job seeker and later friend, Carrie Kelley, a tough and fiery women portrayed in a fine performance by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reese-Witherspoon/dp/B000I9YWZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reese Witherspoon</a>&nbsp;that melts through the stereotypes to deliver an interesting character.

The drama on display here is affecting and real, and the characters are portrayed with such finesse and skill by such talented actors, many Sudanese of which were refugees of war and child soldiers themselves, that it cannot help but be deeply satisfying. It is rare, perhaps, to find a modern film that so earnestly displays such powerful and beautiful emotions on its characters: love, compassion, courage, and the bond between siblings. There IS an element of Hollywoodization of it all... But in the end, The Good Lie is a deeply satisfying, emotionally rewarding, moving, dramatic and heart-warming glimpse into an ugly bit of history and the beautiful people that rose above the pain in their pasts and reunited their family.

Excellently acted, smartly written, with moving drama and engaging characters, with a good bit of humor, history, and a strong moral centre on the side, The Good Lie won't win any awards this season. But that doesn't stop it from being a feel-good, dramatic and powerful film for the average viewer. 4 out of 5 good lies.

P.S. Give this review a like if it was helpful to you. Cheers!",1418601600,69,3420,5.671875
6401434,5,B00K2CI0HG,"Had I not gone to college with the person who wrote the screenplay, Margaret Nagle, I probably never would have heard about the film.  Which is crazy because this is one of the most interesting and heartfelt movies I've ever seen.  The trailer doesn't do justice to the film, I'm sorry to say.  (Reese Witherspoon is just one of the memorable characters in the story.)  If you are looking for a movie about courage, kindness and love for one another, this should be at the top of your list.  I did not see the end coming at all, but it made perfect sense.  I read in the NY Times that it took Nagle eleven years to get this movie made.  The screenplay went through 40 drafts! It is a brilliant film.  The characters have stayed with me as if I've actually known them in person.
