8535774,4,B0094AH3DE,"A very coherent performance from Modena, with nice sets and costumes. The singers are good to very good. Mario Malagnini, who sings the title role, has a fine powerful tenor voice, but his play lacks in emotion. Cellia Costea (Elisabetta) also sings well, but towards the end of the performance her voice begins to lose intonation. Simone Piazzola and Giacomo Prestia sing Rodrigo and Philip II, respectively, with authority. Great sound and picture. A most enjoyable production then, but there is competition from such sources as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Levine/dp/B000A0XS0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Levine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pappano/dp/B003Y58CL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pappano</a>.",1452124800,,810,7.815217391304348
8535775,4,B0094AH3DE,"Don Carlo is Verdi's longest, most ambitious opera. It features his largest cast of principal characters, and Verdi uses the relationships between and among them to explore a broad sweep of issues -- honor and shame, idealism and cruelty, vanity and self-sacrifice, trust and betrayal, repression and rebellion, isolation and community. Furthermore, Verdi probes the very nature of political power, examines the connection and the contest between church and state, scrutinizes the role of individual freedom within society's institutions, depicts visions of heaven on earth turning into the horrors of hell on earth.

And it's an opera Verdi never finished. Even before the Paris premiere in March 1867, Verdi was revising his original score. An Italian translation of the five-act French version was prepared immediately and presented the same month in Bologna. Dissatisfied, Verdi issued a new Italian Don Carlo in 1872, another in 1884, then yet another in 1886. Practically every performance was a revision, as producers and directors chose which scenes to include or omit. Instead of ever declaring a definitive version, Verdi decided to leave it alone and take up Otello.

On a single all-regions Blu-ray, the Tutto Verdi Don Carlo provides the five-act Modena version -- first presented in that city in 1886 -- appropriately staged in Modena, Pavarotti's hometown and gravesite. In the text here, omitted are the opening chorus of French woodcutters and the first entrance of Elisabetta, daughter of Henry II of France, showing her sympathy for her people who suffer from the war with Spain, at that time the most powerful kingdom in the Western world. (The phrase, ""The empire on which the sun never sets,"" was first applied to Spain's Philip II, indicating the vast dominion over which he ruled.) The action commences with Carlo in the forest of Fountainebleu, hearing the hunting horns, then seeing Elisabetta, to whom he has been betrothed as part of the 1558 peace pact between the two nations. While not significant musically, this initial scene more fully explains why Elisabetta consents to Philip as a husband instead of Carlo, denying her personal happiness for that of her countrymen.

In addition, the Modena performance employs the Act III prelude, with its reference to the idyllic Fountainebleu scene, and omits the costume exchange between Elisabetta and Eboli, in which Eboli dons a veil to disguise her identity when she goes to the assignation with Carlo. The duet late in Act IV between Philip and Carlo, which incorporates a theme Verdi used in the Lacrymosa of the Requiem, is cut, but Eboli appears urging Carlo to flee after Posa has been killed. This small, apparently insignificant scene follows through on Eboli's promise at the close of ""O don fatale"" to help Carlo, despite all the turmoil she has caused.

When the ambiguous figure of Philip's father, Charles V, emerges from the tomb in Act V, Carlo disappears in the vague darkness of the back of the stage instead of being embraced by his grandfather and carried to safety. And the conclusion -- which Verdi created for the bowdlerized four-act revision of 1884 -- is a loud reprise of the monks' music from the beginning of Act II. Other five-act productions, such as the one from Salzburg&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-Carlo-Blu-ray/dp/B00H28A5N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don Carlo [Blu-ray</a>], use the more appropriate, hushed closing.

Modena furnishes lavish, colorful, period costumes for the principals, chorus, and extras. In contrast, the opening sets of unvarnished scaffolding give the look of a work in progress instead of a finished grand opera, even though more elaborate stage elements are added as the action develops. Whether by accident or design, this scaffolding -- which remains exposed throughout -- serves as a metaphor of the opera's unfinished nature. The fully developed characters, in rich apparel, inhabit a raw, faulty matrix that represents the incomplete lives they live.

As for the principals, the two women are magnificent. Beautiful Romanian soprano Cellia Costea not only looks the part (as both the young and the more mature Elisabetta) but also sings wonderfully. Only Marina Poplavskaya with the Royal Opera House&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-Carlo-Live-From-the-Royal-Opera-House/dp/B003Y58CL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don Carlo: Live From the Royal Opera House</a>&nbsp;is as impressive. Costea's acting is refined. The very nature of Elisabetta's deal with the devil forces any actress into a certain amount of reserve in the role, but Costea can let the sparks fly, as she does in her Act II meeting with Carlo -- ""Hurry to kill your father, and then, splattered with his blood, you can lead your mother to the altar!"" -- and in her climactic Act IV confrontation with Eboli, in which the adulteress is reduced to assuming the veil of the convent. Although it doesn't come until the start of Act V after a long three hours, Costea's big aria, ""Tu che le vanit&agrave;,"" shows no hint of fatigue. Alone on stage, Elisabetta steps out from behind the figurative veil with which she has concealed her true emotions through the course of her life. Costea rips the heartstrings as she implores, ""If they still weep in heaven, weep over my sorrow and carry my tears to the throne of the Lord,"" and soars as she recalls, ""Fountainebleu. Toward you my thoughts spread their wings."" The final catch in her throat ... devastating.

As both actress and singer, Ukrainian mezzo Alla Pozniak is an engaging, dynamic Eboli. The trills in her Veil Song are to die for. Her explosive reaction to Carlo's scorn in Act III is utterly believable. In the clash with Elisabetta in Act IV, Pozniak rises even higher. ""O don fatale"" is tremendous.

The male singers reveal the unevenness of the Modena recording. At age 60 when this was filmed, Mario Malagnini is too old to pass for the youthful Carlo. He doesn't have a bad voice, although it's not the richest tenor. Unfortunately, he's a wooden actor and seems to possess only one facial expression, no matter what he's singing. Beside Malagnini, young Simone Piazzola as Rodrigo looks more like Carlo's grandson than his best friend. Piazzola sings well enough, but his unseasoned acting cannot compensate for the age-inappropriate pairing. Luciano Montanaro's Grand Inquisitor is passable, but nowhere close to Eric Halfvarson, who owns the role (in both the ROH and Salzburg productions).

The star among the male cast is bass Giacomo Prestia as Philip. To go along with a commanding stage presence, he has the full vocal complement the part demands, plus the emotional range to pour into the acting. I thought Ferruccio Furlanetto was the be-all, end-all of Philips, and he still holds the edge; but Prestia's delivery of ""Ella giammai m'am&ograve;"" is every bit the show-stopper it should be, and the audience roars.

The Modena chorus performs outstandingly in Act IV's auto-da-f&eacute;. The orchestra, conducted by Fabrizio Venture, plays quite well throughout, but one notable oddity occurs. Rather than opening Act IV with a cello solo (perfectly depicting Philip's aloneness), the entire cello section is employed. Because the soloist's tempo is ad lib, trying to force several cellists to play in strict time is not so effective.

None of the video recordings of Don Carlo is completely satisfactory. The ROH production omits the woodcutters scene, the women's costume exchange, and Eboli's arrival at the close of Act IV. Also, it uses the loud ending and adds a conclusion not present in any of Verdi's revisions -- before he can be rescued by Charles V, Carlo is fatally stabbed and dies in Elisabetta's arms! The Salzburg Blu-ray contains more of Verdi's music and thus has a longer running time but still offers a sharper video image and fuller sound than Modena's. Salzburg includes the opening scene of the woodcutters, Elisabetta's and Eboli's exchanging apparel at the start of Act III, and employs the hushed ending, but cuts Eboli's urging Carlo to flee at the end of Act IV. The huge, mostly empty Salzburg stage, however, looks more barren than the unfinished scaffolding used at Modena.

For myself, I'm glad to have all three recordings. Put the best elements of them together, and you arrive at a rounded vision of Verdi's great unfinished masterpiece. It's worth the investment.",1418774400,2,8476,5.256467110125647
8535776,3,B0094AH3DE,"Don Carlo is Verdi's most difficult opera and probably his greatest -(my favorite). It was never finished. Verdi made revision after revision and finally essentialy just gave up. He was happy to have done with it and happier that the next project Aida went so smoothly. I have more than a dozen CDs and about a dozen DVDs (in French and Italian) and none is totally satisfactory. I wonder if one is possible. This present recording has some great moments of profound singing and characterization however some streches miss the mark entirely. Cellia Costea is a memorable Elizabeth and she sang the best of the cast all the way through to the finale. Her voice was right on especially in the duets and her ""Tu che le vanita"" was awesome. Prestia as the tormented king Filippo II had some wobbly notes in the upper register but his ""Ella giammi m'amo"" was heart rending and I have heard Boris Christoff do it in Chicago in 1957.
The Don Carlo of Mario Malagnini was disappointing. He is too long in his career to be playing that part of the young infante. Of all my recordings, Roberto Alagna and Jose Cararras come closest to being convincing and about the right age. Mr. Malagnini is a good singer but no actor. He holds his beloved in his arms and while she sings he looks around to see who else is there. Simone Piazzolo is a fine Verdi baritone, is young and somewhat inexperienced but developed as the performance moved along. Yes this recoring is a composite of several performances. Apparently he got better as the season progressed. As the other reviwers mentioned, I also did not like the Grand Inquisitor; I've heard some Bulgarian and Russian basses declame it so you'd ""quake in your boot"".  Mr. Montanaro sounded as menacing as a train conductor and was off key. For the most part the orchestra played well under the baton of Fabrizio Ventura and sounded like they had rehearsed enough.
Alla Pozniak was a voluptuous voiced Eboli (what happened to the eye patch?) and agile enough to do justice to the veil song and resounding enough to do a gripping ""O don fatale"". And she can act too.
Costumes were quite impressive, sets for the most part not there. No one burned in the auto de fe. Whatever happened to ""Grand Opera?""",1383177600,,2234,4.6272040302267
8535777,3,B0094AH3DE,"How strange it is. I have already written a review here, but it disappeared. Looks like poor Verdi wasn't the only one having problems with censors.... never mind, here it is again and hopefully won't be erased.

I hate to be negative as I rate this series very highly with many first class Verdi performances. Unfortunately, this one is not. I don't profess to know the background, but I find it strange that Verdi's most grandiose and monumental masterpiece would receive such a distinctly second rate treatment. Obviously the producers who decided to go to Modena had good intentions. This performance is the so called Modena version of 1886,i.e. the 5 act Italian version, arguably the best of the many revisions Verdi provided. But as they say: ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"".

The auditorium is opulent, but the stage is small and the acoustics is nothing to rave about. The stage is littered with shoddy wooden props omnipresent throughout the show, sometime they work, sometimes don't. In the forest scene, 1st act, they are in the way and look ridiculous. Stage design should be opulent, monumental, stunning in an opera like this and this treatment indicates low budget. Why?

The conducting is pedestrian, I find it hurried and losing much of the beauty of the score. There is one thing to have an upbeat tempo, like the way Gemetti did Un ballo in Maschera, but here the conductor is rushing and the orchestra sounds shallow, one dimensional, especially in the big crowd scene in front of the cathedral.
The strongest feature, thank heavens, is the singers, but not all.  Giacomo Prestia is the best in show, wonderful, strong, stentorian basso, inspired acting and an impressive figure, worthy of a King. (actually he looks a bit like old Verdi himself in his top-hat). Close second is Cellia Costea.the Queen, beautiful voice, passionate acting, a regal presence. Simone Piazzola is a powerful, expressive baritone,although one would expect more subtlety, grace and elegance in this crucial role of the Marquis di Posa. None of the rest of the cast is in any way memorable.",1377475200,8,2105,4.92112676056338
8535778,4,B0094AH3DE,"Perhaps this is the record with the highest number of coughs in the entire history of the music industry. Indeed, there are times when we believe we are in a theater with high rates of sick people. However, this recording is an honest version of the opera Don Carlo. Very traditional, with period costumes and conventional scenarios. Let's talk about the singers: Cellia Costea (Elisabetta) is at a level above the rest. Beautiful voice, excellent technique and great theatrical skills. The promising Simone Piazzola (Rodrigo) has a beautiful baritone timbre and sings very well, especially in his great solo passages and in the duet with the King, in the second act. The veteran tenor Mario Malagnini (Don Carlo) acts in old school style: little movement on stage, standardized gestures. His voice is appropriate to the role, and the singer knows how to save his instrument when needed. Giacomo Prestia (Filippo II) acts in a very touching way. If the voice sometimes seems a little tired, the lowest notes are secure. Alla Pozniak (Eboli) sings and acts satisfactorily. The choir performs well most of the time (special mention to the Flemish deputies); the competent orchestra sometimes covers the singers. If it is not a version that will make history, certainly is a satisfactory recording, which will provide good entertainment.",1374019200,4,1334,5.123853211009174
8535779,3,B0094AH3DE,"C major wanted to release the complete Tutto Verdi box in time for the 2012 Holiday season and they needed a Don Carlo. Whether this one should have been documented at all, let alone be included in an expensive box is a different question. It's like buying a box of Godiva chocolates and finding one Hershey's inside. Nothing wrong with Hershey's; it just doesn't belong in a Godiva box. This is a very low budget production (the total budget was 60,000 euros, and that for Verdi's grandest of all grand operas). I first thought it's a student production until I checked the credentials of all involved. The stage is made to look even smaller than it really is. The costumes are rich and gorgeous. The set is basic. To call the staging static is an understatement. The ""Modena version"" was used (""Fontainebleau"" plus the revised four-act version in Italian).

Tutto Verdi gives you a taste of provincial Italy (except for the Otello), with hopefully good, idiomatic productions. This production, however, was a relatively insignificant event even in the world of Italian regional opera companies and it didn't even sell well. This video was compiled of 4 performances, the last of which took place on October 21, 2012. On December 18, 2012, less than 2 months later I received my box in Brooklyn! Is that enough time for the engineers to produce the best possible product? There are 2 spots where you can hear coughing or sneezing in the orchestra pit. When was the last time you heard Upper Respiratory Tract noises coming from the pit on a commercially released video? It takes less than 5 minutes to use software to remove these sounds (the studio hired to tape the audio for this production was not hired for any other production in this series). As to the singers, they do their best, some are better than others, one looks ridiculous and one is excellent. When one of the leads loses concentration when not singing and folds his/her arms, holds his/her chin or scratches his/her nose it tips the already fragile balance in the direction of college production standards. Why show this? Didn't the video director have enough time to choose a different take?

This is one way to approach this release, and this was my first impression. The surprise of the low budget aesthetics colors your perception of the singing. On second view I just loved all the singers, except for the Grande Inquisitore and the Frate. I think all the others are excellent - I honestly heard much worse at the MET. These singers sing and phrase idiomatically and most of them have the goods for these roles. The sound is also better than in other Tutto Verdi releases, it's more natural.

I won't try to sell you on these singers - when you have Don Carlo productions from all the major opera companies this one simply does not compete, which is why I couldn't in all fairness give it more than 3 stars. But if you're looking for provincial charm and solid, well schooled singing you may enjoy this release as much as I did.",1367107200,12,3002,4.7034220532319395
