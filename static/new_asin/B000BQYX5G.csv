2438322,3,B000BQYX5G,"She has too many exercises that make you waste time. About half of the exercises are good, and the rest is just a waste of time. She should concentrate in the good exercises to obtain better results. What in my opinion is really good (about 80%) is level 2 of ABS. That is worth the money. Also, what I don't like is that she talks too much. She never shuts up. She is constantly saying something that just drives you crazy. Still this is not for advance people. This DVD is for beginners definitely.",1195430400,5,500,4.329787234042553
2438323,5,B000BQYX5G,"Wonderful short workout that targets specific areas.  It gradually builds up the levels.  You can do one part a day, just 10 minutes.  Work your whole body twice by the end of the week.",1195171200,4,185,4.382352941176471
2438324,4,B000BQYX5G,"I enjoy this one.
Denise has her faults as with Leslie Sansone. However like Leslie, Denise Austin make working out easy for those who are not fit.",1192406400,5,147,4.481481481481482
2438325,5,B000BQYX5G,"I enjoy working out to the Denise Austin DVD. There are multiple levels, and each level is about a 15 minute workout. There are three different workouts for the arms/shoulders, abs/core, and legs/hips. You will need 1-5lb weights for the arms/shoulders workout. The exercises feel good, and I don't feel over or underworked when doing them.",1185580800,9,340,5.089285714285714
2438326,5,B000BQYX5G,"I was pleased with Ms. Austin's style of delivery, the way she starts you off easy and then brings you up to the more difficult work.  I like her no nonsense approach and encouraging attitude.",1168473600,7,192,4.485714285714286
2438327,5,B000BQYX5G,"This is actually my second time purchasing these vidoes- I bought them a few years ago on VHS, and I like them so much that I decided to buy them on DVD.  You really will see results in 6 weeks if you do the exercises 3 times a week.  Each level is very brief (Level 1 is just about 5 minutes; Level 3 is about 20 minutes), so it is easy to get started with minimal commitment.  Then as you get used to doing the exercises, you don't even notice the increase in time.  These are a great supplement to a regular workout to target areas that need a little extra work.  I've been a Denise Austin fan for years and I highly recommend this program.",1168473600,27,643,4.071428571428571
2438328,5,B000BQYX5G,"This DVD is broken into Abs, Legs and Buns, and Arms and Shoulders.  Each section has 3 level of intensity and each workout is about 10 minutes long with the exception of level 3 which seems to be closer to 15 minutes.  If you follow her instructions I am sure you will see results.  She suggests that you do each level about 3 times a week before moving on to the next.  You can get a full body workout if you do 1 level of each section.  I like this idea and have been using this DVD for a while and I get more comfortable each time and I feel my abs getting stronger, my arms and shoulders tighter and my legs and buns more toned.",1167177600,26,633,3.992063492063492
2438329,5,B000BQYX5G,I find the exercises in this video easy to understand yet challenging to execute.  Denise shows step by step how to correctly do these exercises.  Excellent for a beginner or pro.,1155600000,13,179,4.741935483870968
2438330,5,B000BQYX5G,"I have the Abs VHS and bought this as a replacement.  Try it!

15 minutes is better than nothing!",1142553600,10,97,4.052631578947368
2438331,4,B000BQYX5G,"This DVD amalgamates the individual body segment tapes from the Get Fit Fast/Shortcuts on VHS onto one DVD - and I have to say that I am a fan.

I like it how the segments are only 10 minutes long, each with appropriate stretches to warm up and cool down the areas of the body that you are working out, and each body part has three different intensity levels which you can work out to.

Here's what you get:
3 x 10min Legs & Buns workouts
3 x 10min Arms & Shoulders workous
3 x 10min Abs workouts

The set is reminiscent of an industrial locker room, and what pleases me greatly is that the other exercisers in the tape are of different shapes and sizes - there is one exerciser in particular that looks quite curvy; it is quite refreshing!

That being said, I still think that the best toning DVD I own is Denise Austin's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" (though have heard great things about Kathy Smith's ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight"" and apparently Tamilee Webb's ""I Want That Body"" is the best one out there), but I am happy that there isn't a complete overlap between the exercises on SYFFZ and the ones on Get Fit Fast so that I can keep my muscles guessing and vary my workouts at the pinnacle of convenience.

For those of you who have been unable to forgive Denise for her personality in the past, PLEASE don't buy any more of her workouts - she will not transform her personality for any single workout she produces (even the Yoga ones!) and she continues to remain her bubbly, motivating self and still doesn't cue as accurately as some would like.  If you are laid back and intelligent enough to forgive Denise for her personality and embrace the advantages of strength training, I'd encourage you to get this DVD.",1133481600,96,1725,4.425867507886435

2438341,5,B000BQYX5G,"I checked some DVD's out at the library before I decided which one I wanted.  Some are just nutty or obnoxious, you know.  This one has unobtrusive music.  It's easy to follow so you don't have to crook your neck while doing the exercises to know what's going on.  The way it's designed, you can use it to build endurance and strength for several months before outgrowing it.

I've used it for a month and am getting results and am wanting to stick with it.  That's good for me, a 50-something woman who has had fatigue issues.",1382400000,2,527,4.381443298969073
2438342,5,B000BQYX5G,My VCR finally died after many years! I had these workouts which come on this DVD in 3 different videos! Now I can get them and choose which one to use in this one DVD!

2438347,3,B000BQYX5G,I absolutely love Denise Austin but I have to say that this DVD has awkward moments that no one has mentioned. She seems to be touching one of the women that is working out with her way too much and it seems so inappropriate. It was actually hard to watch and made me not want to continue using this DVD. The woman actually looked uncomfortable to me and as if she's trying to make eye contact with someone behind the cameras while it's happening. I just don't know what is happening in this DVD. This was in the abs section level 2. I didn't watch the rest.,1337817600,6,558,4.224299065420561
2438348,5,B000BQYX5G,"Short, 10 minute segments make it easy to work out in between other tasks.  At first the ab routine seemed pretty tough, but after only about a week, I was able to complete all 3 segments at one time.  I love the way Denise reminds you to slow down and concentrate on controlling your movements.  My boyfriend even joins me now, although secretly, I think it might be due to way Denise ""interacts"" with the other girls in the video.  In any event, I'm happy to have company while I exercise.  Great routine!",1322697600,3,507,4.408602150537634
2438349,5,B000BQYX5G,I really enjoy these three workouts. They are challenging and I like how Denise has arranged them to focus on the different muscle groups and I must say that they have exceeded my expectations.,1322179200,,193,4.705882352941177
2438350,5,B000BQYX5G,"I originally had Denise Austin on VHS for each 3 segments (Abs, Arms, Legs and Buns). I loved them so much that I finally got them on DVD, which made it far easier of course to switch from one work out to the next. I will admit, I am rather lazy when it comes to exercising, but Denise Austin has such a positive attitude that it makes me want to work out. I love her enthusiasm such as when she says ""Come on! You want nice shapely arms!"" or ""Let's tighten up that tush!"" etc. It really does motivate you to give the work out the best you can. Each work out session is 10 minutes long, so for me I normally try to do 30 minutes total of exercising because I'll do 10 minutes of each (Abs, arms, legs and buns). Since it's so short, it makes it easy to tell yourself to work out for 20 or 30 minutes to Denise Austin prior to hoping in the shower. That's what I like to do for myself anyway, but everyone has their own schedule that they like to follow of course.

I'd also like to say that her work out's are pretty easy, but very effective at the same time. If you're starting out and haven't worked out in a long time then you may find it a bit challenging, but your body will quickly get the hang of it and it becomes pretty easy, yet still very effective, to do.

Overall, if you're someone who wants a quick way to shape up your body, then this is the DVD for you. And while it varies from person to person of course, you can notice results in as little as 2 - 3 weeks based on what I've read that is =)",1311379200,4,1509,3.9768976897689767
2438351,2,B000BQYX5G,The exercise moves were good but she was off beat and not even the girls with her were on the same beat.  She rushed you through the moves and you could tell she was reading and watching cue cards.,1278892800,3,197,4.051282051282051
2438352,3,B000BQYX5G,I have done a lot of different Workout DVDs several are Denise Austin.  This one I found was just okay.  I was disappointed you could not combine the workouts.  So you could do level one of abs and then had to go back to the main menu to do legs or arms. There are some weird camera angles that I found distracting.,1276300800,4,315,4.048387096774194

2438360,4,B000BQYX5G,"I like this dvd a lot. If I'm tight on time I can choose just one 10 minute routine focusing on either arms, legs or abs. Or, if I have more time, I can put 3 routines together for a 30 minute exercise or longer if I want.

It's great as a total body workout in itself and it works great as an add-on to other cardio work.

The low intensities are definitely for beginners. I have to put the low and high together to get what I consider to be a decent workout but even then the next day I don't feel much. The arms workout isn't intense enough for me. I like this dvd as an add-on or when I want something efficient and effective. However it's not for those days when you want a really sweat-inducing tough whip you into shape kind of dvd, at least not if you're more advanced.",1217548800,5,777,4.038961038961039
