7997677,3,6304291728,"For what I paid for a VHS tape, I expected a bit more of a workout.  The tape is good for someone who has never done spinning before.  It shows how to set up the bike, etc.  The actual workout is only about 40 minutes.",1167782400,2,218,3.8
7997678,1,6304291728,"This video is like a bad joke, This guy Jhonny G, is he real?
I just got this video an hour ago, and now is in the garbage where it belongs...belive me this video is Horrible!!
Buy the EXCELENT Precision Cycling by Jahy Blahnik instead.",1053907200,4,236,4.266666666666667
7997679,1,6304291728,"After reading the reviews, I thought to myself, ""this tape can't be THAT bad"".  Well, I was wrong. It is awful, awful.  I would not even rate it a 1, but I had no other option.  Watching Johnny G is like watching a bad TV evangelist. He is so hoakie.  He gets off his bike and does martial arts moves!  You are much better off spinning to music or a TV sitcom.  My advice, buy a Spinervals tape. They are great workouts - not...like this tape.",1045267200,4,443,4.093023255813954
7997680,5,6304291728,"I bought this video even after the bad reviews from others.  It is great!!!!!!  You have to be in a very good shape to use this video but he says you have to manage all phase 1 to come here.  I think all the bad reviews are from people not really into spinning or they need a different motivation.  Like the one you get from the health club.  They only care about your money and they told you how great you are doing and how good you look (even if it is not true.)
  I used this video for two things:
1. Spinning.  (It is great)
2. Motivation.  There are days that I do not want to get into the bike but after watching the video I have the urge to ride the bike.  It is very emotional.
Like I said before it is for serious spinners (this doesnt mean you have to be hard core what I meant is you really love spinning.)  You will have pain but you have to keep focus, this is your life and you choose to live it at the full potential so embrace it.",1018656000,2,946,3.900523560209424
7997681,2,6304291728,"I bought this video even after reading other negative reviews .... I was therefore expecting the worst, which this isn't.  True, Johnny is pretty hokie (""I'm Clapping For You"") and the music does pretty much stink, it's better than nothing.  I have a spinning bike in my basement and this video comes in handy when I'm snowed in or if one of the kids is sick and I can't make it to the gym.  If you are a serious spinner, I believe you can spin to anything, even this.  It may take a few times getting used to, but I manage to keep my heart rate in the target zone -- he does make you do 100 jumps and then again 50 towards the end.",1010016000,3,632,4.032
7997682,1,6304291728,this tape is a waste of money . johnny g yaks all the time. what an egotistic jerk . i threw the tape away. not even a good workout,984787200,10,131,3.5517241379310347
