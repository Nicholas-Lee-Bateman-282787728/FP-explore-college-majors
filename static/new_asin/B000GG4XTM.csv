Read your history regarding General Giap's (general of the army of North Vietnam). After the communists withdrew from South Viet Nam following their disastrous defeat. The Main Force Viet Cong and the Viet Cong Gurella force had been completely destroyed and over half of his North Vietnamese army was no longer combat effective. In General Giap's own words (look up his history writings) he was going to sue for peace and surrender. Then along came the cowardly hippies and liars like John Kerry after the heavy fighting. This gave Giap the opening he needed to gain a political victory because he saw the protesters were too cowardly to finish what North Viet Nam started.

This caused the United States to run with their tail between their legs breaking the SEATO treaty.

The bottom line is those that made the most noise got the attention crying like babies so they would not have to get down in the dirt and stop the roll of communism through Southeast Asia.

After you have been totally over run by an entire NVA regiment and had to actually strangle an enemy soldier with your bare hands to survive then you do not have the right to hammer the 1st Cav!",1392940800,2,1426,4.650793650793651

Obviously filmed by official sources, this is a one-sided ""pro war"" stance that does nothing to tell the true story of valantry on both sides.  Pure manafest destiny rubbish!",1303516800,,354,4.983050847457627
