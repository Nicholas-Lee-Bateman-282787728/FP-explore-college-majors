5023947,3,B006WEMQS2,"With Halloween approaching it's time to ramp up the horror movie watching,stumbled upon this. I did enjoy it,the closest thing to a modern day Hammer film you're gonna get(without the top notch actors). Nice forest locations. You need to have an appreciation for independent filmmaking to enjoy this.",1474675200,2,300,5.270833333333333
5023948,5,B006WEMQS2,"This is a very interesting rearrangement of the Frankenstein story which manages to create something refreshingly new from the old myth.

We begin with Felix (Frank Warpeha) bringing home his new wife, Safi (Ruth Terefe) to his isolated home in the middle of the woods, which he shares with his sister Agatha (Ticia Martyr) and blind father (Bruce Spielbauer). Secreted nearby, The Monster (Tim Krueger) seems set to learn English from French Safis English lessons  but things never get that far, and he isn't much interested anyway. He is after only one thing, and everyone else he meets, he kills. He has a predilection for pulling out peoples intestines.

Victor Frankenstein (Adam Stephenson) and his new wife Elizabeth (Michelle Shields) are being guarded by seven heavily armed men. Where and when  this happens in regard to earlier events is not clear. The creature, whose creation is told briefly in flashback, is somewhere out in the surrounding woods. Restructuring the story into what is really a series of boo! moments has its merits, with the creature hunting the men who are, in turn, hunting the creature. Pretty soon, these guards are fighting amongst themselves anyway, echoing the behaviour of Robert Waltons crew in the novel.

Theres a new development here: the Monster can regenerate himself. He literally cannot die. Vaguely resembling a bulkier, pulpier version of the fiend seen in Tohos Frankenstein Conquers the World (1965), he is something more than human. One scene, which is (I imagine) unintentionally enduring, is when its severed hand assumes a life of its own for a scene. The idea was never going to succeed visually on such a small budget!

{SPOILER} I opened the door to something unspeakable, admits Frankenstein. He certainly suffers in this story, but is hard to sympathise with  The Monster too has not a modicum of pathos. That is saved for poor Elizabeth, with whom The Monster wishes to mate. In a series of twists at the end, it seems such a thing is possible. Shields is excellent throughout, emerging as the central character.

I really enjoyed this. The locations are excellent  all long shadows, crispy snow and skeletal trees. What it might lack in polish is made up for in the respect shown for the story, and a cast and crew who invest in it a genuine sincerity. A genuinely fine independent adaption.",1472860800,2,2353,4.951776649746193

5023952,1,B006WEMQS2,"just awful, bad makeup, acting, effects, and accents. monster makeup made Frankenstein monster looked like a mime the only real scare in this movie. Everything looked a little off in this movie and very predictable its like a child made this movie. Don't waste your time on this unless you have a sense of humor about really bad movies.",1470873600,2,336,4.711864406779661
5023953,4,B006WEMQS2,"Breaking from the usual Frankenstein tale, this film features his monster as more of a direct and obvious threat, murdering people and causing havoc. Its a fresh way of telling it, as is the extreme amount of gory and blood. I found enjoyment in Frankenstein: Day of the Beast as a kind of wild guilty pleasure.",1470787200,4,311,4.571428571428571
5023954,4,B006WEMQS2,"I went into this expecting the worst, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is an interesting take on the classic story, with a unique method of storytelling for the material. It is extremely gory for a Frankenstein film, and the creature is more animalistic than usual. Nowhere to be found is the pathos of Boris Karloff or performances similar to his. The only real gripe I had was the monster's makeup. It was poorly realized, and cheapened the film somewhat. His face isn't visible for most of the film, so it wasn't a deal breaker.",1470700800,4,533,4.621052631578947

5023961,4,B006WEMQS2,A really cool independent horror flick. It was an interesting take on Frankenstein's monster. Great for a fun view on the couch with a ton of popcorn!,1469923200,2,150,4.592592592592593
5023962,1,B006WEMQS2,"Like community theater. Four stars? What's the point of the star thing anymore really? Some of the scenery and cinematography was decent. Bout it.

5023963,1,B006WEMQS2,"Horrible acting, horrible monster, horrible story - just absolute garbage.
Not even remotely good in a bad way - a total waste of time and an insult to the legacy.
I have to seriously question the 5 star reviews as I suspect they are from the production crew and friends.",1469836800,5,271,4.44

5023966,5,B006WEMQS2,"This is the closest rendition of the classic story that I have ever seen filmed.
While the source material is very familiar - there have been few attempts to do the original material justice.
The acting is very fitting for the time period the film is set in.
Many of the special effects are chilling.
There is a subtle nod to the Hammer-style horror - but with a sophisticated slant.
Great for a stormy night with popcorn in a dark room.",1469318400,2,437,4.407407407407407
5023967,1,B006WEMQS2,"All of the five-star ratings must be from the cast and crew because this movie was absolutely terrible!  The acting was absolutely horrible, and the costumes were horrible!  They actually have a scene where Elizabeth lifts up her dress and you can see her modern day boots!  People saying that this is the best version of Frankenstein have simply never seen any other version of the masterpiece.  It's like comparing Puff the Magic Dragon to Jurassic Park.  Please, do not waste your time!",1469318400,6,489,4.843373493975903

5023975,5,B006WEMQS2,"This definitely falls under the heading of a guilty pleasure -- one of those low-budget flicks that you can't help but enjoy for its atmosphere and attention to detail.  Since we all know the traditional Frankenstein story, this veers off in another direction and makes the monster more like a killing machine that has to be dealt with -- the aftermath of daring to mimic God.  The central part (a flashback to the making of the monster) is especially good.  Lots of gore throughout for those who like it.",1468627200,3,505,4.651685393258427
5023976,5,B006WEMQS2,"Epic movie; what an unexpected surprise! I thought it would be a contemporary take on the classic, but I was wrong. It's Gothic, it's bloody, it's non-stop action and so reminiscent of the old Hammer movies. Highly recommended!",1468540800,6,227,5.0

8505598,5,B006WEMQS2,"I actually dug it, but then again, I'm the monster so you might expect that. I thought some of my grunting and growling was decent and I did an excellent job with the height. I've been really good at height since I was a teenager. Just sayin. I think we see some nice acting from several cast members and some pretty damn nice cinematography as well. More of this is actually based on the original book than any of the film renditions we know and love. If you like classic horror, especially hammer style, and can appreciate a gritty low budget indy, you'll like this.",1508457600,,568,4.419047619047619
8505599,1,B006WEMQS2,"I've seen virtually every Frankenstein related movie there is. This is the worst ever. The acting is just horrific. The dialogue is stilted and stupid. A kid in his basement with a video camera could do no worse. It is an absolute insult to the real story, which isn't even really a horror story, let alone a ridiculous slasher tale. Be ashamed Ricardo Islas and all actors in it, be very ashamed.
The interviews are hilarious. Michele says the characters are great and believable. NOT. Tim says it is honest to Mary Shelley's story. One of the farthest movies from her book!",1493337600,,575,4.647058823529412
