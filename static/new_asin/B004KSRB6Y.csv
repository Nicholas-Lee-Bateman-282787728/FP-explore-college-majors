Like most of the recent cross-over movies; each story is split into 2 parts. The W movie, then the OOO movie. After that the story lines converge into a final climactic showdown.

The W part of the movie is very well done and gives back story on Kamen Rider Skull, a character who up until this point only many brief appearances in the show Kamen Rider W and the movie: Kamen Rider W: Begins Night.

The OOO part of the movie is where it all falls apart.

If you watch this movie as a W fan who has never seen OOO, it's not too bad, but if you actually watch OOO the series (this movie was released half way through OOO's run) it makes no sense in any context.

the last half of the movie is very good and there is a good final fight scene.

The only reason I can think of suggesting anyone to watch this movie is because Ryu and Akiko get married which is a plot line for another movie.  Kamen Rider W Returns: Accel",1326585600,,1054,4.08252427184466
