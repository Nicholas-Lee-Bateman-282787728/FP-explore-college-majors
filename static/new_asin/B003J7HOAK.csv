8397884,5,B003J7HOAK,"As a teacher at a community college, I deal with so many young people who are sitting in a seat who don't want to be in school. In fact, they are tired of going to school but their parents insists they go. We might be better off doing what the Brits do for the royals. Give them a year off to do nothing. I hate to see parents wasting thousands of dollars to send kids to school that aren't ready emotionally, psychologically, or foundationally.",1395360000,,445,4.309523809523809

8397886,5,B003J7HOAK,"The bulk of this video centers around following Michael Clifford, credited with leading the first regionally accredited non-profit university to convert to a for-profit company. For-profit colleges flourish despite charging 5-6X community college rates and double university rates because community colleges and universities are not meeting the demand for higher education.

The two dominant players are the University of Phoenix with almost 600,000 students in 2010 (30% drop in 2011) and EDMC (Education Management Corporation - The Art Institutes, Argosy University, Brown Mackie College, and South University) with 132,000 students. Grand Canyon University, a small Christian school, is an example of Clifford's activity - he bought and made it a for-profit, with about 40,000 current students - 90% on-line.

The video does a good job of remaining neutral, yet pointing out controversial aspects of for-profit colleges. One finding is that they spend on 10 - 20% of total expenditures on teaching, and 25% on marketing. Another that they'll take about anyone, qualified or not, simply to qualify them for a government loan - the University of Phoenix has been documented enrolling homeless off the street; as a result, student default rates among for-profit colleges are far higher than traditional schools.  Still another - they spend considerable monies on lobbying Congress, eg. opposing rules that would make them more accountable for their much higher dropout and default rates. (Unfortunately, the Obama administration also needs their participation to meet its goal of substantially increasing the proportion of college graduates within the U.S. - thus creating an impediment to strict regulation.) Making the situation worse - the loans are given for any line of study - regardless of potential employability.

Those looking for a non-profit college to buy prize one with accreditation - Clifford sees the process as otherwise taking ten years, about $10 million dollars, and leaving one with only a 50-50 chance of success. At least one head of an accreditation agency promises to stop giving for-profit colleges such little supervision in the future.

Three more points, not included in the video. One is that Intel announced several years ago that it would cease paying for its employees to attend the University of Phoenix - concerns over high dropout rates and quality of instruction. The second - just last week 60 Minutes reported on for-profit colleges substantially misstating their graduates' 'success rates' - counting employment they already had before starting at the school. And the third - the 11/28/12 Wall St. Journal reported that student loan debt now totals almost $1 trillion, that 11% of balances were 90 or more days behind (a rate that is understated because it excludes those with deferments for being unemployed, exceeds that for credit cards and up from 8.9% in the prior quarter), and that the current level considerably exceeds the debt levels on credit cards, home equity loans, and car loans. Student loans are given for any plan of study, regardless of the likelihood of leading to the ability to repay the loan.",1353974400,2,3157,5.318637274549098
8397887,4,B003J7HOAK,"This movie does a fairly good job of reflecting the peril that people going to for-profit colleges face. If one chooses wisely, they can make this new format work, but if they select a less than reputable school they may face economic ruin. Why? Because the degree will never be worth what one paid for it, and this documentary does a great job of exposing which schools fall into that category. The reason these schools exist is to make a buck, and we should not forget that. However, making a dollar is not exclusive of providing a good education, and this dvd shows how. Get it and learn.",1330300800,,591,4.481481481481482
8397888,5,B003J7HOAK,"This documentary was very interesting and very true. I always heard there were colleges that were just for profit and now I know which ones are.

I will never go to these schools: Phoenix, Devry, ITT, Everest, and so on. Mainly because most of those schools are ""NOT Accredited"" schools. They teach you things on the job, but top employers want students that came from accredited schools. If you just want to work for some small no name place, you might have a chance there, but it's not a sure thing either.

I found that colleges that you heard the most about online and on TV commercials are the colleges all for profits school. Hmm... why is that? Well, because they are for profit and just like other big business companies this is the best way to advertise and get more customers. It doesn't mean they care about you though, once they got your money, you are left to fend for yourself.

Those schools care about one thing, money, money, and more money! Don't ever contact these schools, if you want help finding an actual job. As for as they are concerned, they taught you the skills and if you can't find a job, tough luck!

Also, if you contact the school just to asks about their program and say no to joining, it is not the end of the story. They will just keep following you and keep howling at you to enroll with them. Everyone that thinking about going to college and never been there should check out this documentary to find out which ones NOT to go to.",1313971200,,1468,4.405904059040591
8397889,5,B003J7HOAK,"Essential viewing for anyone looking at post-secondary schooling.

I watched this when it aired last Spring (2010).  I've seen lots of advertisements for various ""cool"" majors (like music production, video game designer, etc).  The program was a sobering, cautionary tale for those seeking higher education outside the ivory tower.
I'm personally not a huge fan of higher ed myself (despite having a couple of degrees - I think apprenticeship/hands-on training is better), but I am very irked by the prospect of companies preying on would-be students and burying them in debt.  I recall commenting to my girlfriend (who is in vet school) that it was probably more expensive to do a vet tech program here (at the for profit school) than she was paying at the UW (to become a veterinarian).  Sure enough, it was well over $20k per year (while she pays $16k).  This compares to $7-8k for the (longer established and accredited) vet tech program at the local community/tech college.
I guess my question is why the for-profit institutions charge so much (especially if a sizable chunk of the coursework is online).  Perhaps the answer is that people are willing to pay (or loan) money for it.  So much for the idea of competition driving prices down.",1281830400,5,1245,4.923444976076555
8397890,3,B003J7HOAK,"Frontline exposes how for-profit colleges are making investors rich but might not be good for the state of education.  It notes that these schools cost four times as much as community colleges.  Recruiters may use unconscionable practices (but so does the military, so why aren't they being scrutinized?).  Further, though the students at these colleges comprise 10% of learners, they may compose 50% of student loan default.  Moreover, this problem may come at the taxpaers' expense.  These schools often spend more money on ads than on teaching.  Still, the work ends by saying there are not enough seats in traditional schools to go around.  It asks, ""Will [for-profit colleges] become 'too big to fail'?""

That was all fine and good, but there's so much more that I want to know.  Do employers value alums from traditional schools more than the for-profit alums or do they not care?  Community colleges have a lot of remedial courses and let students know that they need to bone up.  Are the for-profits doing the same?  Are students actively taking tests and writing papers or does just listening to a lecturer on your computer equate to learning something?  If these companies want money, will they pass all students in all classes?  If there is homework, papers, and tests, how does the school monitor fraud?  For example, can't an MBA student pay someone with an MBA already to complete things for them?  Can they take that person's old papers and present them as original work?  Why is the Dept. of Education accrediting these schools?  Aren't the instructors at these colleges tarnishing their resumes?  Are these schools a dumping ground for the lowest-quality instructors?  This program just did not answer my questions or fears.  I'm still not sure if students at these for-profits are dupes or crafty skill-learners.",1277424000,4,1830,5.01328903654485
