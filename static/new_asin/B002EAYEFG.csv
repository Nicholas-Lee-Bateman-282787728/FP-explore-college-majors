8367306,4,B002EAYEFG,"This is one of the best Silents I have seen.  What makes it so good is both the acting for the time and the location filming.  I mean, I can't see how the treks through that kind of weather could have easily been filmed in studio.  It certainly looked authentic. It had to be Alaska, especially, the Chilkoot Pass scene.  Also, I like Robert W. Services poems (The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation of Sam Mcgee, among others) and this movie is based on, I believe, the only novel Service ever wrote.  The novel was written in 1910 and the movie was made in 1928.",1387843200,,570,4.289719626168225
8367307,5,B002EAYEFG,"The Trail of '98 is a superb motion picture; it's also one of the last great films to be shot without sound even though there are a few sound effects. The acting is very convincing; the cinematography is unbelievably good and the choreography reflects great forethought. As others have noted, this movie really does have it all: romance, action, suspense, backstabbing, danger, the struggle of mankind versus nature--and more! The musical score is well done and the plot progresses very well.

When the action starts, we see the news travelling all across the United States that gold--huge amounts of gold--has been found in Alaska. Despite the rough trip ahead of them, many people begin the trek to Alaska, including two brothers from South Carolina, people from Michigan, Arizona--and so many places more! Some of the people journeying to Alaska include brothers Jim (Ray Hallor) and Joe (Ray Gallagher); Mr. and Mrs. Bulky (Tenen Holtz and Emily Fitzroy) with their daughter Berna (Dolores del Rio) and the patriarch of their family (uncredited, sorry); Salvation Jim (Tully Marshall); Lars Petersen (Karl Dane) and Larry(Ralph Forbes); an train engineer (E. Alyn Warren) and even a young boy (Cullen Johnson).

After they travel by ship from the West Coast to Alaska; they think the worst part of the trek is behind them; but sadly the odyssey to Dawson City and gold mining territory in Alaska has really only just begun. Now they all must trudge through blizzards, each carrying so much food on their backs that they can barely make any progress on any given day; and when they have to make it through Chilkoot Pass, rivers using their self-made boats and Whitehorse Rapids not all of them survive.

Look for terrific romantic chemistry between Dolores del Rio and Ralph Forbes as Berna and Larry; their acting is impeccable. Moreover, we see the roles of villainous claim-jumper Jack Locasto (Harry Carey) and his friend (Doris Lloyd); they also try to manipulate and control Berna while Larry is away making an attempt to find gold and strike it rich. How everything works out, including whether or not people strike gold remains the focus of the picture.

The DVD does not come with any bonus features although the quality of the print is not that bad. The only thing you can do is move ten minutes ahead or backward using your remote. Nevertheless, this is still an excellent film well worth watching.

The Trail of '98 will appeal to fans of great silent film; fans of the actors in the movie and dramas based on real life in general. I highly recommend this film.",1346803200,,2576,4.872146118721461
8367308,5,B002EAYEFG,"RECEIVED QUICKLY IN GOOD CONDITIONS AND IT IS A VERY GOOD FILM very well packaged
The direction bt Clarence Brown is superb",1343692800,,123,4.636363636363637
8367309,3,B002EAYEFG,"... as the film opens with that famous RKO radio tower and herds of cattle being driven across the plain. Then the narrator begins ""Kansas, where desert plain spreads without boundary"". What??? Kansas??? Isn't this supposed to be an MGM silent  about the Alaska gold rush of 1898 starring Delores Del Rio? I check the DVD case and it clearly says ""Trail of 98"". The DVD is also clearly marked the same. However, it seems, the Warner Archive strikes again and I received ""Trail Street"" starring Randolph Scott rather than ""Trail of 98"" in spite of every indication to the contrary. This is what happens when you pay big bucks for a MOD product probably made with loving care by a ten buck an hour outsourced IT professional who got careless because he/she was boning up for his/her next job interview by reading a current issue of ""PC World"" rather than paying attention to making your DVD. Of course I bought this DVD a couple of years ago so it's too late to return it now. Don't let this happen to you. Buy only pressed DVDs where if a mistake is made it is made 1000 DVDs at a time. I don't think I've ever heard of a case of someone buying a copy of ""The Thin Man"" and receiving Stephen King's ""Thinner"" by mistake.",1342051200,,1219,4.417777777777777
8367310,4,B002EAYEFG,"This movie has it all --- adventure, drama, romance, comedy, horror. The story follows the saga of several different people from various parts of the country and various walks of life as they all head to the Klondike to get rich during the Alaska gold rush of 1898, and what happens to them after they reach Alaska. The story is well-told, and the pacing of the movie kept me glued to the screen. This is an exceptionally well-made movie. It was among the last of the big-budget silent pictures, and it shows in the locations, cinematography, costumes, props and sets. Authenticity was paramount in the making of this film. It was arduous for the actors and crew, who had to endure months of frigid weather conditions (60 below zero). Several stuntmen were killed during the scene on the rapids. Ralph Forbes and Dolores Del Rio are beautiful and believable as the romantic couple. Harry Carey is superb as the villainous Locasto. Karl Dane, George Cooper, and Tully Marshall provide delightful comedy relief that plays well even today. The supporting cast are all interesting and fun to watch. Be sure you're wrapped up in a nice warm blanket before viewing the movie because the scenery will chill you to the bone. The fate of some of the characters is horrifying and for others satisfying. The only negative thing I found in this movie is the musical score. It is the original score, and there's way too much of the marching theme throughout --- it got on my nerves. That's a minor thing though --- I really, really like this movie.",1295395200,4,1535,4.710037174721189
8367311,5,B002EAYEFG,"Released just as sound was revolutionizing the film industry, this silent epic is one of the most spectacular and entertaining of its kind, all the more interesting for the fact that it's set against the backdrop of the Yukon Gold Rush.

The story is very simple: various strata of society from around the United States learn about the discovery of gold in the Klondike and head to Seattle, where the meet aboard a steamer headed to Skagway; upon their arrival there, they proceed to climb over the Chillkoot Pass into Canada, then sail down the Yukon River to the rough-and-tumble overnight city of Dawson. At the center of the story is, inevitably, two young lovers and the moustache-twirling villain who comes between them.

Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is vastly entertaining and quite spectacular--the running of the rapids is particularly memorable and there's a tremendous fire for a climax--all of it handled with meticulous care by the underheralded Clarence Brown.",1257724800,6,984,5.105590062111801
