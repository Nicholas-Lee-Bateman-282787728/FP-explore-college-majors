4917426,5,B0060O0OJW,"Louis Sullivan was a great architect and like other great architects was broke the day they die, you shoul wash this video if you are going into architecture for the money.",1377043200,3,172,4.580645161290323
4917427,5,B0060O0OJW,"Very thoroughly researched, very nicely done, if you love architecture or art history you will love this DVD. Also if you are a person who loves Frank Lloyd Wright this will give you a lot of insight as to where some of Frank's thinking originated.",1366502400,7,248,4.533333333333333

Good production value, great visuals, well researched, interviewees focus on Sullivan's work and on his essential character.",1354492800,4,236,6.181818181818182
4917429,5,B0060O0OJW,"If you love Louis Sullivan, American architecture, Chicago architecture or Frank Lloyd Wright, you will want to watch this film.  Before Wright there was Sullivan, the true bridge from the humanity of the 19th century and the simplicity of the modern.  Outstandingingly clear and detailed color cinematography, and excellent telling of Sullivan's philosophy and biography.  I almost never buy DVDs, but I had to see this one and it is well worth it and is one for the library.  It belongs on PBS.",1328832000,7,496,4.9397590361445785
4917430,5,B0060O0OJW,"Superbly filmed, edited and scored documentary,from beginning to end, on one of America's greatest but least known geniuses. If you don't know anything about Louis Sullivan this is without a doubt THE place to start. I've read a few books on the ""beloved master"", as Frank Lloyd Wright called him, but even his superb prose pales and shrinks to nothing beside his buildings and ornamentation. His life was tragic but he was unshaken and noble until the end. I was literally in tears towards the end of the film.

The only improvement I could see would be a director's cut with more interview material and more images of his buildings.

This was truly a documentary worthy of its subject.",1322697600,20,687,4.764705882352941
8490575,5,B0060O0OJW,"A Truly Wonderful Documentary!!! I Thought That I Knew A Lot About Louis Sullivan, Now I Know Far More Than I Was Ever Expecting To Learn!!! Very Highly Recommended To Anyone Interested In American Architecture and Most Especially To Those Who Are In Awe Of Louis Sullivan's Amazing Organically Decorated Masterworks!!! My Only ""Complaint"" Would Be, That An Hour and A Half Just Wasn't Long Enough To Do Louis Sullivan and His Work, All The Justice That He Deserves, But It Came Very Close!!!",1528502400,,492,4.869047619047619

8490578,1,B0060O0OJW,My copy came today and I was appalled that the cover was two pieces of cardboard and not a plastic case. For the price should have been better protected. Very cheap on your part.,1456185600,,178,4.264705882352941

8490583,3,B0060O0OJW,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother and boy, was I disappointed with the packaging. The picture looks so nice on the cover,  but in reality the package is disappointing.  The  DVD package is made out of a cardstock cardboard with the picture you see in the description.  It's a little disappointing to give this as a gift since with this packaging it seems ""cheap"". I paid $20 for this and for the price, they could have put it in a nicer, quality case.  I wished it would have came with a regular ""jewel-case"" like most other DVD movies should. On another note, I have never seen this video and unfortunately I cannot comment on it.  The 3-star rating is for  the disappointingly cheap packaging!",1389830400,2,710,4.5
