8180507,1,6301777654,Boring movie,1433721600,,12,5.5
8180508,2,6301777654,Not that great of a movie. The title was undoubtedly more appealing.  Weak  story line and some oddity within the female character's behavior that just did not gain my interest.,1406937600,,177,4.866666666666666
8180509,3,6301777654,it was an okay flick. Not exactly super acting or a great script. It was simply okay. Not sure if I'd rent it again.,1396828800,,116,3.875
8180510,4,6301777654,"...but twisted story of a suicidal young man, his homicidal wife, her sleazy lover and his disturbed brother. It's definitely not going to be for all tastes, but I stuck with it right till the end. The plot was easy to follow and the cast is  game.",1394323200,,248,4.276595744680851
8180511,1,6301777654,"The plot is terrible, no passion; not even worth a full star or the time it took to type this review.",1391990400,,101,3.857142857142857
8180512,1,6301777654,No story. No passion. I was not expecting fireworks but I could not even finish watching this. Slow. Darkly filmed and hard to get into.,1377216000,3,136,4.48
8180513,5,6301777654,"Get this video if you can find one. A too-nice young man has inherited the family mansion, but is in over his head with his choice for a wife. Advertised as an erotic murder thriller,Mortal Passions is really a black comedy with an assortment of memorable characters - I liked all of them. It's a masterpiece for Krista Errickson - a gorgeous meanie(years later I saw an old video of Little Darlings - a teens at camp movie - and there she was - the same *#$%*!). In Mortal Passions, she pretty much doesn't fool anyone (except her shrink). This is a great video to show guests if you want something fun but not stupid.",1177113600,10,619,4.391304347826087
