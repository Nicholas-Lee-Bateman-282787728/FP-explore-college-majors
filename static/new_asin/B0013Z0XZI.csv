3120955,5,B0013Z0XZI,"I bought this DVD in hopes that it would help me with adding sensual movement to my pole dancing addiction(I own a pole fitness studio).  It gave great tips, instruction was very clear and concise as well as great exercise.

Putting the moves together to create your own dance is very easy with the detailed, step-by-step how to's.

Definitely the best exotic moves type of video I've seen.  Well worth the money.",1211500800,16,413,4.694444444444445
3120956,5,B0013Z0XZI,"Angi Carlston does a great job of clearly describing and demonstrating all the core striptease moves you'll ever need to put together a sexy dance routine.  She then shows some transitional moves, combination moves, a few advanced moves, and a whole set of ""specialty"" moves that go along with the unique and fun dress-up fantasy ""Performance Videos"".  Angi and her two students each pick one of the fantasy themes and do their own demonstration dance as well.

Other than a very short intro and tips section (which are separate selections from the menu), there are no interviews or other ""filler"" material.  No fancy video editing tricks or slick graphic effects to distract from the instructional content either.  It's a very straight forward and down to business presentation, with multiple camera angles, and very good sound quality (shot at a professional sound studio).  This one is much more organized and more ""produced"" than the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strip-To-It-Bump-n-Grind/dp/B000BH4BLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strip To It - Bump n' Grind</a>&nbsp;DVD, which is more informal and done in a typical home environment.

The ""Performance Videos"" are a very cool idea and a lot of fun!  They are NOT videos of women doing striptease routines, as you might tend to believe from the description.  Rather, the Performance Videos are videos designed for you to use while performing your own routine.  There are ten different dress-up fantasy soundtrack themes, with a Performance Video for each.  These themes are: School Girl, Naughty Nurse, Secret Agent, Ninja Seductress, Cowgirl, Firefighter, Cheerleader, Racing, East Meets West, and Cop / Bad Boy. The soundtrack for each theme is presented in both 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, as well as regular Stereo.  The video track for each theme has simple graphic patterns that are synchronized to the music and are meant to be used as sexy back lighting for your dance.  The idea is to try to recreate a club experience at home with the surround sound music and sexy colored lighting.  If you don't like the soundtrack music provided, you can also turn off the audio and play your own favorite music, and there are several ""video only"" backgrounds as well, including a couple of stroboscopic type videos, as well as multiple background ""slides"" that can be changed in real time with your remote.  You can give your man the remote and let him control the video lighting effects in real time while you dance!  It's a lot of fun!

Finally, if you don't have a nice home theater area to play the Performance Videos on a DVD player and dance at the same time, there are full MP3 versions of all the songs on the DVD-ROM section that you can use to burn onto a CD or copy onto your portable music device, so you can use the music anywhere you want to dance.  The DVD-ROM section also has a section of helpful hints and instructions on how to use the Performance Videos, as well as some behind the scenes photos, and credits.

Great value for the money.  Just the instructional content alone is worth the price of the DVD, but the fun Performance Videos and soundtrack, and the free MP3 files, definitely make it a great total value.

As always, don't base your purchasing decisions on reviews.  Visit the company web site for previews of the videos and music so that you know what you are getting ahead of time.",1204070400,45,3427,4.996478873239437
3120957,2,B0013Z0XZI,ok for first time instructional dvd but seen all these moves before. Nothing new.  Just wished i didn't pay that much for it.  It wasn't worth it.  I'll stick with my Flirty Girl Fitness DVD.  Any suggestions on some really Advanced or more realistic moves?  Can't seem to find any good ones.  Don't want to take another risk.,1268697600,,326,4.5344827586206895
3120958,4,B0013Z0XZI,"This was an inexpensive DVD & I think you get your money's worth.  It could have been a little better, but has some good stuff in it.",1267488000,,133,3.925925925925926
3120959,3,B0013Z0XZI,"I bought this thinking I would learn some cute moves to surprise my husband.
When I started the video I expected it to run like a workout video, (instructor will show the move and then let the viewer practice a few times before moving on) I had to pause after every move. I realized I wouldn't be practicing many of the moves b/c my TV room has carpet.  I would have needed a large hardwood floor to do things like the caterpillar. These moves would look great if you were up on a stage. They don't look so hot if your husband is sitting in a chair watching you squirm around on the floor.  Also the instructor shows you a variety of moves but doesn't show you a step by step routine. There are routines done with music at a fast pace at the end of the DVD.  Not bad but...  I didn't learn anything that I could surprise my husband with..",1255910400,6,838,4.154320987654321
3120960,5,B0013Z0XZI,"I highly recommend this DVD.  It is exactly what I was looking for - I am an amateur who wanted to learn a few moves for my spouse.  She teaches in the very easy to follow manner, shows how to combined a few moves, and shows a complete dance at the end.

Also, it is a nice workout as well",1250121600,3,289,3.783333333333333
3120961,4,B0013Z0XZI,"First of all, I actually bought this DVD, plus two Madame M's, and one of the ""Fawnia"" striptease DVDs, all at once. I think the combination of all really worked to strengthen the impact of each one individually. If I'd had any ONE of these DVDs only, I wouldn't have gained enough movement vocabulary to put any kind of routine together. Okay, so that said, about this DVD in particular.

I'm 40 and have ballet, tap, jazz dance experience, but nothing in the way of social dancing, hip-hop, or exotic moves at all, and little confidence in this area. For me, this DVD as an instructional video was really tasteful, perfectly paced, unintimidating, and approachable. Of the four I bought, this one contained the best instruction, was the easiest to follow, and contained the most number of different types of moves. I personally spent a lot of time rewinding and practicing each individual move over and over until it felt natural for my body, and then moved on to the next bit. What this DVD lacked, was choreography - I would've liked the instructors to put together some short combinations so I could see how things might go together. But in combination with the Madame M DVDs, it gave me great stuff to work with.

The demonstration routines at the end not entirely representative of the moves you learn throughout the DVD - they were faster, and included lots of new moves and combinations you don't see earlier. But you can't learn everything in one DVD. Besides, the demos are good for giving you ideas.

For the people who have or might criticize this DVD for it's music, or lack of work-out, or whatever - this is definitely not clubby, hip-hoppy, Christina Aguilara ""do-me"" type of stuff; and it's definitely not a dance-along work-out kind of thing. It's instructional. Learn it, practice it, find your own music, put your routine together, and pass the DVD onto someone else who wants to learn how to be a little more sensual with their bodies.

I'm pleased with the purchase and it's giving me exactly what I wanted.",1243555200,19,2030,4.709859154929577
3120962,1,B0013Z0XZI,"The cover is the most exciting part of this DVD. It's all downhill from there. Some good basic moves to pick up but not enough to make watching the uninspiring, unimaginitive lessons. Even the 2 following in the back look in need of a shot of expresso. Bland, unattractive sets, black yoga pants and tanks, even the 'demo routines' meant to give ideas & spark your wild side are lackluster at best. While I wasn't expecting feather boas and twirling pasties, I was hoping for a fun, sassy, idea producing DVD. If these gals were professional 'strippers/dancers', they'd be a hungry, poorly tipped group. Sorry ladies...",1236038400,6,619,4.849056603773585
3120963,4,B0013Z0XZI,If you have the S Factor DVD's (or take S Factor classes like I do) this is pretty much the same thing different names for each move.  However this does teach a few things extra and an excellent section for putting the moves together into 5 move combinations - something my classes have not taught!  I am now utilizing these combo's in my class routine as well.  Each move is well explained.  It is worth buying even if you have other similar video's.,1226793600,,451,4.397590361445783
3120964,5,B0013Z0XZI,"I really enjoyed this DVD, and my husband really enjoyed the private fantasy strip dance I did for him!

Angi is a great teacher, very down to earth and the DVD didn't waste any time with useless talking or interviews.  There was a short introduction and tips section, but it was less than 10 minutes and was a separate selection from the main menu, so you can skip it and go right to the moves.  I also liked that every move was on its own chapter point with a short title screen, so that you could quickly jump around the DVD to find the moves you want to practice.

I think they covered more than enough basic strip tease moves to please anyone.  The package says there are 22 core moves, which seemed about right, plus 5 transitional moves that show you how to go from standing to the floor and back.  Then there were also some wall moves that you can do if you have an open wall where you are dancing, and a few advanced moves (which I didn't attempt yet).  There is also a section on specialty moves that they came up with to go along with the dress-up fantasy themes. Angi also goes through a couple sets of combination moves, showing you how to put some of the moves together, which was very helpful.  Then there are also demo dances where each of the three dancers does their own demo dance routine using nothing but moves learned on the DVD.  If all that isn't enough for anyone to put together a sexy dance, then I don't know what else you would need.  There was certainly more than enough for a beginner like me, and I didn't even come close to using all the moves in the dance I put together!

I thought the soundtrack type music was great!  I personally don't like the offensive type of hip-hop music that they play at most of the clubs.  These soundtracks were mostly instrumental, with some little dialog segments and sound effects to help set the scene for a particular fantasy.  I really loved the Agent 69 theme, and decided to use that one for my dance.  The best part is that there is a video light show to go along with it!  I dimmed the lights in our living room and had it playing for my strip tease, and it was a lot of fun. I felt like I was on stage with the light patterns flashing behind me as I danced, and my husband really liked it as well!  The performance videos are not meant to be ""watched"", but rather used as lighting effects... as long as you keep that in mind, you'll really enjoy them (just don't try to sit in a dark room and watch them directly)!

I think this DVD was definitely a big step up from the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strip-To-It-Bump-n-Grind-exotic-dancing/dp/B000BH4BLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strip To It - Bump n' Grind (exotic dancing)</a>&nbsp;DVD, which I also own and enjoyed!  That one was much more laid back and done in a typical living room environment, and concentrated on lap dance techniques.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that there is a link on the DVD where you can sign up for the customer only area of the Strip To It web site and you can download quite a few more video clips and music files for free!  I enjoyed several of those as well.",1222128000,4,3173,4.473958333333333
3120965,3,B0013Z0XZI,"I got this dvd with the hope that it would be something good to share with students to augment class instruction.  This dvd does not live up to my expectations.  Angi Carlston is talented, clear and articulate, but her talent and teaching abilities are not used well on this dvd.  I wish she had stuck with the idea of just covering basic erotic moves for home viewers and not have gone into the specialty and/or advanced moves (which seem out of context without choreography to support these movements). Basically, women who buy dvds of this nature just want to learn basic moves and some short dances to turn on a partner.  Women who are able to do advanced moves generally will not buy or need dvds to teach them.

Furthermore, I think a lot of valuable teaching time was wasted on the introduction and tips.  This info could have been condensed.  And, the bonus material is a total waste of time as it is not instructional nor does it teach choreography.  Moreover, the music on this dvd is awful!  It's instrumental, boring and flat---nobody plays this stuff in the clubs!  The flashing screen stuff just plain got on my nerves!  You'd have to be high on ice to get any enjoyment out of this (so glad they gave the seizure warning!)  I was also disappointed that most of the basic moves covered were floor moves so if you have bad knees, beware!  Plus, no modifications were given for women who are overweight, older or who have back problems.  I'm so sick of dvds that are geared toward skinny, flexible 20-somethings when I find a range of sizes, shapes, ages and flexibility amongst students!  I hope the next time anyone gets an idea to produce an erotic dance tape that they'll stick with basic moves, teach some choreography (it's so hard for beginning students to improvise initially) and put some focus on poses, facial expressions and hand movements!",1216771200,23,1864,4.657492354740061

Plus, it has little nuggets like the performance enhancement videos- I can't wait to use that one on a live audience!

Con: The blonde might be a dude, the Goth chick is incredibly awkward (Perhaps the stripper video equivilent of the token fatty in an exercise video?) and Angi has a regretable tendency to speak in a sleepy monotone.",1212537600,3,574,4.683168316831683

8253648,2,B0013Z0XZI,This just seems like a very mediocre video on simple dance techniques. Stuff you would see on the dance floor at your local club. I am not impressed.,1377302400,,149,4.357142857142857

8253650,4,B0013Z0XZI,"I was really impressed by this DVD, it was the first one I bought in my quest to learn more about this particular type of dancing. I loved the dancers featured as they were all totally clothed and the moves are basic and the instructions are simple and easy to follow. What I did not like about this DVD is that the dancers show a beautiful dance routine, but it is hard to follow, step by step. Learning the basic moves I would watch the move and pause the DVD and practice in my room with a mirror during a few songs on the radio. I enjoyed practicing the moves on my own and especially feeling sexy in my own body as I learned to do the moves better with time. I would have liked a break down of the dance routines as to how the dancers went from one step to another, the only way to learn that is by a thorough practice of all the moves and then a good study of their dances. Honestly I did not want to repeat watching their beautiful dances and feel that it was impossible to learn how to do what they did; I was expecting more of work out style instructions. The basic moves are taught in this simple way and I appreciated this part of the DVD most but the dances are just demonstrated without instruction.

All in all I am very happy with my purchase and I really appreciated learning the basic moves and the quality of the DVD. However I only have a laptop computer and could not access the ""additional"" materials on the DVD.",1341792000,,1433,4.1732851985559565
8253651,5,B0013Z0XZI,"I liked this DVD. A large catalog of moves taught with very thorough break-downs. The instructor really takes the time to show you everything (at a slower pace). It is set up like a class, in a studio. Good production, lighting and the instructor and students are dressed in yoga clothes. Counted about 46 moves covered-from hip movements, rolls, crawls, walk, kicks, poses- to wall slide, transitions and floorwork. There are 2 small combination sections that demonstrate how to put some of the moves together. There is also an introduction and a small section on tips, offered.

Three choreogphies are performed by the instructor & her students- angent 69, cheerleader, east meets west. They incorporate the moves that you learned and give you an idea of what a complete dance would look like. I thought it would have been nice if they had taught each choreography- there is only the performance demo.  But I think once I am comfortable with all the moves, I can easily  pick up the choreography after watching it a few times. I also wish they would have worn some type of costuming in these segments. It would have made it more fun to watch and would have helped illustrate the theme better. Just a few things that would have been nice but no harm done.

Also on this DVD, you can choose different colored backgrounds with music, lighting effects and strobes for your TV screen. It is intended for you to play while you dance in front of it. A nice concept but I didn't think it wasn't really that effective (maybe with a bigger screen)...others might like it.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to learn exotic dancing for fun or to try out a few moves on your hubby. Alot of good material here and it is covered very well,  so that even those with ""two left feet"" should be able to pick it up.",1334361600,,1823,4.576687116564417
8253652,5,B0013Z0XZI,"I thought this DVD was an excellent choice - it showed good moves in a modest and comfortable visual enviroment.  I have back/spine complications, so I was physically limited in what I could do, yet I did try some of the moves and found it fun for my husband and I.",1325548800,,265,4.196078431372549
8253653,2,B0013Z0XZI,"I bought this dvd to enrich the striptease lessons I give to beginner women and also thinking it would give me new tricks for my personal performances as a dancer.
I was disappointed.
I would say this dvd is useful only if you are a complete beginner as a stripper and ALSO as a dancer. If you're already a dancer, the movements presented are so basic you can catch them in any video clips or videos on youtube etc.
And there are not so many of them.
On top of that, it looks a little bit ""amateur', as the background and the clothes of the teacher and pupils are not very glamourous. It doesn't inspire you to be sexy.

The part with music and video backgrounds you are supposed to use for your performance is ridiculous, I don't know where they grabbed this style: not the 90's, not the 80's, not the 70's nor the 60's...so ???????
The routines presented are not sexy at all.

So if you're a complete beginner as a dancer, you will learn the basic sexy movements which will very soon, I hope, seem very easy to you as you will continue training.",1273363200,3,1047,4.309644670050761
8253654,5,B0013Z0XZI,Loved this DVD. It really walks you through the moves. Not a huge cardio workout but a lot of stretching.,1269907200,,105,4.3
