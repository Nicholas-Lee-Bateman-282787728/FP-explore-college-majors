8135211,5,B000GYI95I,"I am very pleased with the Heath Merriman videos on golf. If you have any golf knowledge you will appreciate the detail Heath goes to in covering a subject. Anything from lining up to the ball, direction of your divot, position of the ball and the angle of your hands, importance of weight shift, etc. He is careful to slowly explain the proper way to execute a swing to acheive the results you are looking for. I would highly recommend golfers to check this video out with golf club in hand. His other videos, Golfing Made Easy, The Short Game, and Rules and Etiquette of golf are also well worth your money.",1199836800,,609,4.446428571428571
