8568251,2,B00BGMG21C,"This film focuses on the life of a soldier over a 40-year periodhis exploits, friendships, and romances. Filmed during WWII, this film is viewed by some as a classic. Its a comedy/drama/romance/war movie with an why-we-fight theme, but I could not get into this movie. The comedy in this British film falls flat in most cases with only a few chuckles. There is no straight narrative since the plot flashbacks to different time periods in the life of the main character. A positive is that it is beautifully filmed in Technicolor, and Deborah Kerr is engaging in the three roles she plays. In the opinion of a casual viewer, though, I feel I wasted  nearly three hours of my life. [It's a long film.]",1500768000,,699,4.637096774193548
