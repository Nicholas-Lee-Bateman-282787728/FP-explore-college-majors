5340452,5,B009INAJYM,"I felt it necessary to write a review because the one review (literally, one single review) that was left for this item only gave it 3 stars, merely because there was no Blu-Ray option for this collection.  Don't get me wrong: if there had been a Blu-Ray option available, that is the direction I might have gone, but the one reviewer did not discuss the content or the actual quality of this specific collection.

Anyway:  overall I was very pleased with the collection.  There isn't a theme to the collection, other than being a sampling of National Geographic documentaries from over the decades, starting with the first ever National Geographic broadcast, ""Americans on Everest"".  For me, a few of these documentaries took me back because the opening music/credits reminded me of watching some of these documentaries as part of school curriculum, or with my grandparents when we would all gather around the television when a ""National Geographic Special"" was going to air (FYI: this was before cable).

The DVD quality is excellent but some of the older broadcasts (due to the quality/deterioration of the original film) do look their age, most noticeable in the ""Americans on Everest"" and ""Holland Against the Sea"", but the overall transfer to DVD was good.  The newer broadcasts (and documentaries from the National Geographic cable channel) are of excellent quality; the quality is merely a testimony to time and newer digital technology.

In terms of ""bang for your buck"" there are over 20 documentaries in this collection and there is something here to please everyone.  Granted there will be some you like more than others (the Egyptian documentaries were my personal favorite but I enjoyed everything in the collection) but overall a great DVD collection.",1368576000,62,1766,5.062068965517241
5340453,3,B009INAJYM,I'm highly disappointed that there is apparently no Blu-ray version of this.  How can you release a documentary in 2013 without a high-definition option?,1366502400,7,153,5.375
5340454,1,B009INAJYM,Material actually in it is not the material advertised.  A waste.,1424649600,,65,4.909090909090909
5340455,4,B009INAJYM,I thought it was an archive of the National Geographic's magazine. But I liked the content provided as well.,1422057600,,108,4.7368421052631575
5340456,3,B009INAJYM,It's OK skips from subject to subject a little to fast to really get any type of understanding of information being offered.,1421712000,2,124,4.681818181818182

5340458,5,B009INAJYM,Was on special so we ended up buying two sets. Both love them. How canyou go wrong with Nat. Geo!,1393977600,2,97,3.9
5340459,1,B009INAJYM,"I bought the 7-disc version.  The scan quality is so poor that it renders the text almost unreadable.  The print becomes more crisp when you zoom in, but then you can't scroll down to read the rest of the page.  Maybe the 10-disc version is better.  I wouldn't recommend this version to anybody.",1391731200,,295,4.509433962264151
5340460,5,B009INAJYM,The best of Nat Geo documentaries.  Would also recomend the 125 years of National Geographic Magazine set for those who love the magazine - every issue since 1888.,1383696000,4,163,4.821428571428571
5340461,5,B009INAJYM,The qulaity is good and photography is fantastic. I recommned people to keep this 125 year collection in your home/library. This collection deserves 5 stars rating. Thanks to National Geography for introducing this collection.,1382486400,6,226,5.676470588235294
5340462,2,B009INAJYM,"There is nothing wrong with the presentation, it is just simply that the material wasn't what I wanted.  Over the past forty years, I have been collecting National Geographics, including quite a few old issues from the fifties and  forties, all of which I dipped into during the evenings.  On moving a to smaller house, we wanted to reduce our library space, and we heard of a set of CDs which included all past issues, plus indexing.  So I gave my hard-copies to our local school and ordered what I was led to expect was the CD equivalent.  It isn't, and the DVDs in the Collection are only of passing interest to me.  .",1381795200,5,621,4.4035087719298245
