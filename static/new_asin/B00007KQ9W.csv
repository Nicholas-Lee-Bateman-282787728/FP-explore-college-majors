I really enjoyed this film, it is very simple and believable, I felt I was on holiday with this family. This is like as Sunday afternoon movie you would put on and relax and watch.",1114128000,9,268,4.0754716981132075
1818389,4,B00007KQ9W,"This film set on the beaches of Brittany,  is an engaging story that shows the pleasure and pain of adolcence. During the summer of 1958 two sisters, 13 and 8, are too much for their governess too handle. There spirited antics take them from pranks to real trouble. But neither of the girls are ready for the path that their mother has chosen. Diane Kurys did a wounderful job directing this film.",1077840000,16,397,4.513888888888889

7977626,4,B00007KQ9W,"Set in the summer of 1958 in France, a man sends his wife and two daughters on vacation without him. He can't leave his business for that long. He rents a small house for them to stay in near where his wife's step-sister lives with her family. However, when her and the children arrive at the train station, she sends the girls off with the nanny, but does not accompany them. She is instead planning on leaving her husband and movie to Paris with the children and goes to Paris to prepare while the children vacation with the nanny.
The first hour of the movie is spent following the girls dealing with their step-cousins, their nanny, and the cranky landlord of the vacation house (who lives on the first floor of the rent house, which is referred to as the basement by everyone else). The story is partially narrated by the 13-year-old girl through her dairy entries. There are several things happening, the main two are: the girl is in love with her slightly older step-cousin: and there is a club nearby which they are not members of but the children spend time there anyway.
Not a lot of any great importance happens during this hour, but it is still entertaining and the story of the mother's plans is filled in during this time. She does join the girls and leave again during this first hour of the movie. The drama (or should I say mischief) with the two girls and their step-cousins keeps the movie from getting boring while the ground work is being slowly laid for the conclusion.
The girls father arrives about thirty minutes before the end of the movie and that is when the action really picks up.
As I stated to start with, not a lot happens in this movie. However, I still enjoyed watching the little things with the children, and one big plot situation with the parents, play out.",1377561600,2,1796,4.512269938650307
7977627,5,B00007KQ9W,"What can you remember from your childhood?
C'est la Vie is a pleasant airy film about a seaside family vacation.
Some of it is wonderful happiness and some it unfortunate sadness.
This is a movie about life, love, reality, and also comfortable leisure.
The majority of the film takes place on the beach and has a strong
relaxation vibe.  The story is about 2 young girls that visit family for
a summer trip.  The trip will turn out to be a life changing learning
experience they will never forget.  Their estranged parents have some
serious problems. Throughout the film these problems slowly come to
light.  It is the reality of the situation and the truth must come to be.
When innocence is lost experience is gained:
C'est la Vie (Such is life).  Take a breather and check this one out.
C'est la Vie successfully takes a tough topic and frames it
through a humorous lens.  Overall it is a nice film that
might make you think about your life in a sunny beach vacation sort of way.",1349568000,,982,4.519774011299435
7977628,4,B00007KQ9W,"I have watched this movie 3 times. Once with no subtitles, once with the english subtitles, and lastly again without subtitles. I'm sure I'll watch it again. This film is very good, but especially if you have experienced your youth, or adulthood in a similar situation.

*Potential Spoiler*

The scene toward the end when the husband confronts the wife after seeing the coaster, when frederique screams, ""je me tuerai!"" Its very difficult to watch, but probably the best scene in the film.

A great film, althought serious in nature, could be viewed by the whole family. I recomend though, if you don't understand french you probably won't appreciate the film as much.",1252713600,2,668,4.946428571428571
7977629,5,B00007KQ9W,"Apparently this is a companion piece to director Diane Kurys' masterpiece, Entre Nous. This film is set in Brittany in the summer of 1958 and it is a spot-on depiction of that era and the trauma that a divorce can inflict on children.  It really nails childhood's not-so-innocent behaviors-sneaking and smoking cigarettes, playing doctor, and vandelism.  It also does an excellent job with awakening puberty and the loss of beloved pets.

The cast is just super, the simple costumes exude French style, and the sets really are well done.  It offers a compassionate look at the lives of two people who can no longer be married.  Your heart aches for the young protagonists watching their life fall apart.  I was honestly most affected by the ability of these modest income folks being able to afford to spend the summer at the seashore with friends and family, of eating fresh seafood and swimming in surf.",1243123200,,905,4.8441558441558445
7977630,1,B00007KQ9W,"I saw this movie and I found it both shocking and choking. It displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes! Did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars? (Yes, the cigarettes and the smoke were real, not CG.) I think they should have omitted such scenes from the script, because it displays a behavior that's not only illegal in several countries, but also threatening to both society and childhood. No matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie, I give it a disgusting 1, and this is the last movie I ever watch that depicts smoking children. To those that haven't yet watched this movie, please DON'T WATCH IT, unless you want cancer to win the health wars.

And here I hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker: if you want to depict smoking children, use COMPUTER GRAPHICS instead of the REAL THING!",1123545600,5,896,4.670886075949367
7977631,5,B00007KQ9W,"I have seen this movie on the German TV yesterday with the title: ""A summer at the sea"" and I was deeply impressed.

Despite that it was produced in 1990, the theme is more up-to-date than ever. Excellent actors of all ages performed very well indeed, a great story, some romantic spots and lovely music will make you thinking about the relationship of children to their parents, their pain and childish emotions which often get hurt.

This story could happen today, next month or the following year, next door of you .. or at any other location or country. So you will get nothing NEW out of that movie but the sad reality of daily life in the eyes of children whose parents can't behave.

I only can highly recommend this movie - buy the DVD and you will enjoy it definitively more than just one time.",1114214400,6,803,4.448979591836735
