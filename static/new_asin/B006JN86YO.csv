4994234,5,B006JN86YO,"This new version of Pound Puppies (from The Hub and Hasbro Studios) is a great show and it is extremely underrated. The show has sharp humor, fun characters, a great voice cast, and sweet, touching story-lines. Many of the same elements that ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic"" has. So if you are a fan of ""Friendship is Magic"" you will also like this Pound Puppies show.

This Pound Puppies series stars the voices of Eric McCormack, Yvette Nicole Brown, Michael Rapaport, John DiMaggio, Alanna Ubach, Ren Auberjonois, and M. Emmet Walsh.
Plus, Betty White voices a recurring character (whom you'll see on a couple of this DVD's episodes.)

As a side note, the first 7 episodes of the series had pretty rough, rigid-looking animation. (None of those episodes are on this DVD) After they aired, the animation studio changed, and starting with episode 8 onward, the show has clean, fluid animation from the same studio that animates ""Friendship is Magic"".

The 5 episodes on the disc (all from season 1) are great, very funny and sweet. The DVD also includes the small bonus feature ""Learn to Draw Lucky!"" in which storyboard artist Mike West shows the viewer how to draw Lucky.

If you are a fan of this show, then you will definitely want to purchase this DVD.",1344988800,5,1262,4.748858447488584

The dogs are adorable, the story is entertaining and held little *e's* attention all the way through each episode. The DVD features five episodes plus one bonus feature:

Homeward Pound
My Fair Rebound
Quintuplets
K-9 Kid
Zoltron

Bonus Feature: Learn to Draw Lucky

Final comment: Two paws up from little *e*!",1333584000,,457,4.896103896103896
4994236,4,B006JN86YO,"I loved Pound Puppies when they were on during my childhood and it is great that they have come back for a new generation.  The new Pound Puppies is a totally different animation of the puppies but still cute.  With talking animated dogs you really can't go wrong!  The episodes are fun and the dogs made all of us laugh.  The show is about a ""pup for every person"" and shows kids great lessons!  We have watched the DVD a few times now and it has yet to get old for us.",1331596800,5,470,4.065217391304348
4994237,5,B006JN86YO,"I've been a huge fan of Pound Puppies (this series) since day 1 and when I saw that a dvd was coming out, i practically died from joy!! From what i've ""researched"" there are 5 episodes on this dvd, here they are:

Episode 8- My Fair Rebound
Episode 9- Quintuplets
Episode 11- Homeward Pound
Episode 15- Zoltron
Episode 19- The K-9 Kid

these are very good episodes and i'm going to order this as soon as i get money!! GO POUND PUPPIES!! if ur as much of a fan as i am (and i'm a HUGE fan!!) then preorder this dvd NOW!!!

UPDATE:
Ok, i recieved my copy of the Pound Puppies Homeward Pound DVD April 21, 2012 and it's AWESOME!! The back contains 1 pic of episode 2 which is NOT included in this DVD set. This dvd contains Homeward Pound (ep 11), My Fair Rebound (ep 8), Quintuplets (ep 9), The K-9 Kid (ep 19), and Zoltron (ep 15) (in that order). It comes with a bonus feature which is a character artist showing you how to draw Lucky DIRECTLY IN THE STUDIO!! Also on the back, the show is rated TV-Y7 (it's original rating) and the characters on the back are a little paler than usual. Plus they add Mr. NutNut as part of the team (when, technically, he's NOT!!). But, on the plus side, it comes with the FULL version of the very 1st Pound Puppies ad on the hub and its AMAZING!! it also comes with the very 1st ad for My Little Pony as well. The menu, when it starts opens with the Pound Puppies theme song beginning, but with end credit audio. The menu itself is animated using 9 Story Entertainment (even the select episodes part!!). The only thing in the menu that Studio B animated was just a picture for the How to Draw Lucky part of the DVD (even though the eps are from Studio B). Well, that's my review and this DVD deserves 5-stars!!",1326758400,7,1744,4.2155688622754495
