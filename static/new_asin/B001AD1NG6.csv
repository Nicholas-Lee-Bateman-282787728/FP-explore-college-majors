8277087,4,B001AD1NG6,Rasputin is a interesting movie.  Not as good as Dark Servant Of Destiny but good in it's own way.,1413331200,,98,4.157894736842105
8277088,1,B001AD1NG6,"Poor casting, too.  I'd recommend Nicholas and Alexandra over this movie.  If you want to learn more about Rasputin it's better to read a book about him.",1366416000,3,153,4.62962962962963
8277089,2,B001AD1NG6,"As I hadn't seen this film (known as ""Nights of Rasputin"" when it was released in the UK in late 1962) for over forty-six years, I thought I would try to find out if it was on DVD, so that I could see it again after all these years. Originally released in the US and UK by MGM, this version on Sinister Cinema DVD is apparently the only one available anywhere. Sinister Cinema are not known for high quality transfers and this one is no exception.

Firstly, it's a DVD-R disc transferred from a murky 16mm black and white print (the film was originally photographed in Eastman Color with British prints by Technicolor). Secondly, the version used has been cut to 85 minutes from the original running time of 95 minutes.  But as I hadn't seen it since early 1963, it's hard for me to say what has been cut out. Originally given an ""X"" certificate by the British Board of Film Censors, it would probably pass as a ""U"" certificate these days, judging by the content of this DVD. Thirdly, the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 instead of the original film's 1.85:1 and lastly, the print used is extensively damaged in at least three places, causing the film to jump about all over the place. But it does right itself after a few seconds each time.

As for the film itself, it isn't too bad, although with Edmund Purdom giving a completely over the top performance as Rasputin and John Drew Barrymore giving the best performance as the Russian prince who kills Rasputin. Although it's set in the same era and covers some of the same ground as the vastly superior ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" made ten years later, this French / Italian co-production is far from being in anything like the same league as the 1971 epic that starred Michael Jayston; Janet Suzman and Roderic Noble. ""Nights of Rasputin"" was originally released in the UK as the lower half of a double-bill with ""Corridors of Blood"", starring Boris Karloff.",1247788800,6,1900,4.59882005899705
