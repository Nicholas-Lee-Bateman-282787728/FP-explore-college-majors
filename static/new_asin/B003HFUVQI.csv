4125593,5,B003HFUVQI,"As a kid who grew up both dreading finding Freddy in my ally AND attending every Elm Street movie alone on opening night, I have to say that finally, in my 30's to recieve such an amazing documentary on the films that introduced me to horror is LONG overdue. BUT so worth the wait. Come on, 2 discs and about 8 hours of content? What more could an Elm Street kid ask for? I do hate that Patricia Arquette, Ronee Blakely and Johnny Depp were not included, as was any mention of the score to Dream Child! They skipped from Dream Master to Freddy's Dead...what happened there? I was also bummed after watching the special feature about the remake. I had no idea that so many toes were stepped on to make it. And although I did enjoy Jackie Earle Hailey's take on our cinematic boogyman, this documentary reminded me how lucky I am to have so many Robert Englund performances to watch over and over again. He will always be the TRUE Mr. Krueger. I also cannot wait for the ""I Am Nancy"" doc. I grew up loving Heather Langencamp, and believe me if she was at a convention I went to, I would be first in line for Nancy! So grab this dvd if you get a chance...any horror lover and Elm Street Kid will sleep well knowing this is in their collection!!!",1273363200,,1242,4.2893617021276595

4125595,5,B003HFUVQI,"Years ago I bought the Nightmare on Elmstreet Collection on DVD expecting all kinds of goodies, and was sorely disappointed.  All we got was the unnecessarily impenetrable Nightmare Encyclopedia, in which half of the features were not indexed and impossible to watch without going through a stupid DVD game that took hours of your time.  This Never Sleep Again DVD is incredible though.  Disc 1 is a highly entertaining 4-hour documentary, and Disc 2 is a little more focused on Elm Street fandom.  Heck, the DVD is worth watching for the stop-motion chapter introductions.  I had a great time watching this and if you've got all of the movies on DVD, you've gotta buy this 2-disc DVD to complete it.  Shame on New Line for not doing something like this the first time around, but major kudos to the producers of this set for such a high quality treat for the fans.  A terrific coda to the Englund-era Krueger movies.",1273276800,,917,4.69375
4125596,5,B003HFUVQI,"I finally received my copy of Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy in the mail yesterday, and despite having finals I have managed to consume all the material and let it digest.  I've been a big fan of these retrospectives that have been coming out the past few years, first with Halloween: 25 Years of Terror and His Name Was Jason so I was eagerly anticipating Never Sleep Again.  So how does it stack up?  Let's take a gander:

These horror retrospectives keep improving every time in regards to style and content.  I remember purchasing Halloween: 25 Years of Terror and it absolutely blew my mind.  It wasn't perfect but as a huge fan of the series I was instantly enamored of the set and all the amazing features it contained.  It was a loving tribute to the Halloween Series and all the creators and fans therein.

Imagine my wonder when I picked up His Name Was Jason when it was released a couple years later and discovered that it was Even Better.  Like a lot better.  This doc got pretty much everyone involved with the series for an interview and provided a fabulous and highly entertaining feature on the series.

Now, just in time for the Nightmare on Elm Street remake, comes Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy.  And, wow.  Just wow.  This 2-disc DVD set is EVEN BETTER.  It is truly sprawling, informative and wildly entertaining.  There's so much stuff here I'm actually at a loss as how to review it, but damn it, I have to try!  So here are some of my somewhat unorganized thoughts on the DVDs:

The documentary itself, which is the main feature, clocks in at a whopping 4 hours (!) long and covers pretty much everything and I do mean everything.  Just about everyone you could think of that has been involved with the Nightmare on Elm Street series are on hand to give their thoughts on the series and share some memories of what it was like to create a genuine horror icon.  All the obvious faces are present: Wes Craven, Robert Shaye, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Sarah Risher, Rachel Talalay, John Saxon, Jack Sholder, Rennie Harlin, and Stephen Hopkins.  All these people have been featured on previous Nightmare docs but it's good to have them back and some of them have some new stories to tell.  Other than them, pretty much all of the main cast and crew of the various Nightmare films are also present and accounted for.  Obviously the ""big"" stars like Johnny Depp, Laurence Fishburne, Patricia Arquette, and... Breckin Meyer are absent, but just about everyone else is there.  As a side note, given what he's said in the past I can't help but think that Johnny Depp would have done it if he'd been asked and his schedule could permit it.  I don't know if they had the balls to ask him or not.  I guess we'll never know.

Anyway the people that are there give some fantastic insight into the making of Nightmare on Elm Street and all its sequels.  Each individual film gets plenty of time for a thorough examination with each clocking in at about a half hour (the first one gets about 45 minutes).  If you watch the doc and feel like something was missed, never fear, for the bonus features include extended interviews which include many juicy details and other tidbits that didn't fit in to the main feature.

Lisa Wilcox has aged like a fine wine.  So has Kim Myers... and Amanda Wyss... and Erika Anderson.  Some of the others weren't so lucky.  Ok, now with that pointless superficiality out of the way...

Wes usually pops up for each of the sequels to give his (usually) negative thoughts on them.  He usually has a good point.

Some of the interviewees are a little dry (and Jack Sholder comes across as a major prick.  So does Chuck Russell) but most of the others are rather jovial and seem genuinely excited to be talking about the impact of the films on their lives.

 Robert Englund comes across as one of the kindest men you could ever meet, and I don't think he says anything negative about anyone in all 8 hours worth of DVD.

Ronny Yu is here to give his thoughts on Freddy vs. Jason even though he wasn't there for His Name Was Jason.  Curious.

Pretty much everyone involved insists that Freddy's Dead was a good movie and they were right to make it like they did.  Wrong.  This is odd to me because usually the cast and crew are quick to point out things that don't work in other installments.

I got a huge kick out of the Robot Chicken-style opening credits and bumpers between each segment.  They were really clever and amusing.

Anyway there are over a dozen (I guess, I didn't count) extra features on the second disc so there is plenty to amuse yourself with.  I'm not going to describe all of them because I don't want to be here all night and no one will read it anyway.

So, in a nano-nutshell, if you're a huge fan of the Nightmare series, you should definitely pick this up.  Casual fans may not need this much information, but for Fred-heads everywhere, this set really hits the spot.

Sweet Dreams.",1273190400,5,4976,4.510067114093959
4125597,5,B003HFUVQI,"If you are a Nightmare On Elm Street fan like me and felt sick to your stomach with the new Elm Street movie, as well as a total lack of respect for the fans and franchise by the makers of said catastrophe, don't fret. 2010 is still the year of Freddy for the fans...just not with the new film. Nope. You see, the fans get something better. Something much, much better. 2010 is the year of Freddy because we get what is ultimately the most amazing present/documentary ever. A 4 hour treasure that looks back on our beloved series. If you got the Freddy fever that is sweeping up again, this is your one stop destination for the cure.

From the makers of the Friday The 13th docu, ""His Name Was Jason"", comes this look back at the 26 year old Nightmare On Elm Street franchise. HNWJ was great. Great fluff. Don't come into this one thinking it is something along the same lines. What we have here is something far reaching and serious. Unlike the quick 90 minutes of past docus, this amazing gem is 4 hours long!. It's Freddy/Elm Street overload that should put every fan in an Elm Street induced coma(with special appearance by Freddy, of course). Every single movie in the franchise(excluding the remake), and even the short lived TV series ""Freddy's Nightmares"", is given it's due. A ton of people from the franchise, from both in front of and behind the camera, are on tap here to give up the dirt on the series. All of the regulars you would expect to be here like Craven, Englund, Langenkamp, etc. are all on board, but there are literally tons of people I have never seen in any kind of Elm Street docu or featurette ever here as well. It's just a non stop parade of Elm Street veterans, ready and willing to take a trip back down Freddy's favorite street. A lot of goodies await including behind the scenes moments and make-up tests as the interviews go on. Some things here might be familiar with the die hard fans, but some of it come from new people and new perspectives. But don't worry, there is plenty here that keeps things fresh and new for even the biggest Elm Street fan. Another amazing thing here is how, for 4 hours, it really moves along at a nice pace. It never gets old, boring, or repetitive. It's completely fascinating and even the casual fan should be completely enveloped in the brilliance of it all. Some of the best moments are from the section of Part 2, ""Freddy's Revenge"". I'll leave it at that.

The 4 hour documentary is about as awesome and wonderful as it gets, but there is more. Oh so much more. Once you rest and regroup, you will be on to disc 2. The second disc comes with 4 more hours of Elm Street goodies. We really are spoiled. Disc 2 features 2 hours of extended interviews that were cut from the finished documentary. Then there is a brief preview of the upcoming documentary ""I Am Nancy"", brought to you by Nancy herself, Heather Langenkamp. It's great that one of the greatest horror heroines gets her due. ""For The Love Of The Glove"" is pretty self explanatory. A look at Freddy's infamous weapon of choice and some people who own one. Part 2's Robert Russler(""Grady"") also appears in this featurette. ""Fred Heads: The Ultimate Freddy Fans"" also says it all. A look at those Freddy fans and the merchandise they have. Fun stuff. My favorite feature here is ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds: Return To Elm Street"". Sean Clark takes you on a journey of the filming locations for the movies. I won't spoil the surprise of who, but some Elm Street alumni pop up here as well. ""Freddy Vs. The Angry Video Game Nerd"" is a quick feature on the Freddy game. ""Expanding The Elm Street Universe: Freddy In Comics And Novels"" shows that Freddy's power and popularity is not just relegated to the silver screen. ""The Music Of The Nightmare"" is a bit with the Nightmare series' composers. ""Elm Street Poster Boy: Matthew Joseph Peak"" is a brief chat with the man responsible for all those awesome Freddy movie posters in the 80s, as well as this very documentary!. ""A Nightmare On Elm Street In 10 Minutes"" is what you think it is.

In the end, this is just a gigantic valentine to the fans, the franchise, and the character of Freddy Krueger. A strong mix of deep biography and wonderful nostalgia. This film was expertly put together. It should make sense that the most well regarded of the horror/slasher franchises gets a tribute fitting of the franchise's colorful history and brilliant creativity. This is what every Freddy fan has been hoping and dreaming about. But dream no more. It's a reality and it's here. No nightmares here. It's a perfect dream come true.",1273017600,36,4602,4.548854041013269
4125598,5,B003HFUVQI,"Aside from parts 1 and 7, the DVD releases of the other films in the Elm Street series have absolutely no extras at all. Finally, someone has taken the time and effort to give Freddy fans and the other entries much needed and much deserved (and overdue) attention. ""Never Sleep Again"" is an exhaustive four-hour documentary that leaves no stone unturned. Featuring new interviews with every director involved in the Nightmare films (including Freddy VS Jason) and practically every cast member from each movie, this is the kind of thing fans like me have waited decades for. The production value is top notch, so much that New Line should be embarrassed for not commissioning something like this (instead of the ""Nightmare Encyclopedia"" disc they included on the boxed set) years ago. Narrated by Heather Langenkamp and featuring super cool stop-motion animated sequences inspired by iconic scenes in the original films, no Elm Street completist should be without this disc.",1272931200,20,974,5.132075471698113
4125599,5,B003HFUVQI,"Never Sleep Again is a excellent biography over the Nightmare on Elm Street series. Unlike Halloween or Friday the 13th biographies, this one doesnt leave anything out and it's a staggering four hours long. I noticed the first thirty minutes (give or take) have lighting problems as the picture goes from light to dark during interviews but it stops. A must own for fans of the film or horror movies in general, this one doesnt leave alot out.",1272844800,3,443,4.6923076923076925
4125600,5,B003HFUVQI,"For those who wonder what's on this set...

Disc 1:
Main Feature - 4 hours
Although there's a few notable absences (Ronee Blakely, Johnny Depp, Patricia Arquette, Craig Wasson, etc.), the bulk of the surviving cast/crew members from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" through ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" are interviewed.  They even touch on the TV series ""Freddy's Nightmares.""  Includes clips from the films (and tons of other related films), never before seen photos, on-set footage, deleted scenes and more!

Disc 2:
Extended Interviews - 2 hours
Additional interviews, separated by film, that didn't make the final cut.  Annoyingly, there's no ""play all"" feature, and there's some sound issues (the stereo sound is off-balance during several segments).

First Look: Heather Langenkamp's I Am Nancy - 7 mins.
A sneak peek at Langenkamp's forthcoming documentary.

For the Love of the Glove - 18 mins.
A superfan shows off his collection of prop gloves from the films; and several people who create and sell glove replicas are interviewed.  Elm Street 2 star Robert Rusler also discusses the day the glove was stolen from the set.

Fred Heads: The Ultimate Freddy Fans - 13 mins.
A look at Freddy merchandising and its fans.

Horror's Hallowed Grounds: Return to Elm Street - 23 mins.
A tour of the locations from Elm Street 1, featuring appearances by several cast members from the first two films.

Freddy Vs. the Angry Video Game Nerd - 5 mins.
A humorous look at the '90s Nintendo game.

Expanding the Freddy Universe: Freddy in Comic Books & Novels - 16 mins.
Authors of Elm Street comic/novel spin-offs discuss their works.  Again, the stereo sound is off balance for a good chunk of this featurette.

The Music of the Nightmare: Conversations with Composers & Songwriters - 13 mins.
Guess what this is...

Elm Street Poster Boy: The Art of Matthew Joseph Peak - 7 mins.
Peak discusses each of the posters he designed for Elm Streets 1-6.

A Nightmare on Elm Street in 10 Minutes - 10 mins. (duh!)
A chronological, rapidfire montage of lines from the 8 films, re-spoken by original cast members.

Teaser Trailer - 1 min.

Hidden Easter Egg - 3 mins.
Charles Fleischer's insane ramblings.

All in all, this is an incredible collection of materials that shames the extras that New Line's released in the past.",1272758400,80,2299,4.878865979381444
4125601,5,B003HFUVQI,"As the product description states this is a marvellous must have for all slasher fans and especially for the fans of the sub genre of serial killers.
 There were many of them like chucky, leatherface, pinhead, wishmaster...etc, but the most well known are the father = myers, the son = jason and the unholy spirit = freddy and after the doc we got about jason and myers now is the turn for the unholy spirit and at last the freddy doc is here full of extras to please any loyal fan.
 I'm curius to see the deleted scenes and i hope the video ""bring your daughter...to the slaughter"" by bruce dickinson to be included in this set.
 Freddy dominated the theaters with 8 films so far with part 4 to be the most successfull if we exclude Freddy vs. Jason.
 In my personal opinion here are the NOES films from best to worst:

 1. The dream warriors
 2. NOES
 3. Freddy vs. jason
 4. The new nightmare
 5. Freddy's revenge
 6. Freddy's dead the final nighmare
 7. The dream master
 8. The dream child

 Now freddy is back with a new remake and we see how he will evolve in the future until then let's enjoy this new dvd which i will ad to my collection together with the other horror icons dvd's (jason , myers)

 PS.

 Watch for new releases in the future of two new dvd doc. One of those two will be about the living dead legacy.",1271635200,2,1325,4.228

4125620,3,B003HFUVQI,"A FOUR-HOUR documentary about the Nightmare on Elm Street films.  That seems like an awful long time to spend on the ins and outs of a wildly inconsistent franchise.  However, there is a lot of affection for Freddy and his victims out there, and I must say, they did a very good job on this film, even though FOUR HOURS is a long time to invest for even the most rabid fan.  I got through by watching it in manageable chunks.  Since it is conveniently divided into a 20-30 minute section for each film from the original to Freddy vs. Jason (including the short-lived TV series that I had completely forgotten about), it is probably best viewed as a companion to a rewatch of the series.  If you love the franchise, you will probably give it more stars than I did.

I'm not going too much into that but the documentary itself. If you like the franchise I would definitely recommend this. Especially if you're into documentaries. It's 4 hours long and very in depth. The only people who aren't in the film is Johnny Depp, Patricia Arquette, and maybe 1 or 2 others. Otherwise everybody else is included. It starts out with Wes Craven talking about Freddy's origins and how he was inspired to create this, and about how this was the start of New Line Cinema (which is another thing they touch on a lot, about how the company was really built on the franchise). And they talk about the first and the second and so on and so forth. The go very in depth into each movie from the franchise, and honestly it made me appreciate some of the later movies that I had mixed feelings about a lot more than I had before. They even talk about the Freddy's Nightmares TV show and Freddy vs Jason. I believe this came out not long before the remake so that wasn't talked about obviously. But they covered everything up until that date and in great detail. And as I said its 4 hours long so they really go deep into the series.

There are numerous interviews with many of the actors, directors, producers and writers involved throughout the series, many of which, have never been interviewed before. This is further a must own, because with the exception of the original Nightmare, Wes Craven's New Nightmare and Freddy vs Jason there have been few special features and no commentaries on most entries in the series so this is your best bet if want to know anything about the making of the other entries in the series. The DVD also has an informative commentary from the filmmakers on how they were able to bring so many collaborators together from the Nightmare series without really knowing any of them. Don't hesitate if you don't already have this. Check it out!",1440806400,,868,4.754966887417218
4125642,5,B003HFUVQI,"Never Sleep Again is the 2010 documentary chronicling the entire Elm Street franchise from its humble beginnings in 1984, up until the 2010 awful remake. Produced by and co-directed by Daniel Farrands, Never Sleep Again is a fascinating and pretty comprehensive look at the making and impact each film throughout the series has had on American culture. Daniel Farrands is no stranger to the horror genre and has been covering ""making ofs"" of such films as Friday the 13th part 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, as well as ""His Name was Jason"" a documentary on the Friday the 13th films, ""Scream: The Inside Story,"" as well as the writer of ""Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers,"" and writer/director of his magnum opus ""Crystal Lake Memories."" In other words, this guy knows his stuff.

Now, about the documentary itself: Narrated by Heather Langenkamp (Nancy from the original film), this FOUR HOUR documentary contains over 200 interviews from casts and crew of all films of the franchise, including Wes Craven, Bob Shaye, Robert Englund, Kevin Yagher and tons and tons and tons of others. The only real omissions I saw as Johnny Depp (obviously, busy with other projects) (although there is a clip from ""Inside the Actors Studio"" where he mentions the film), Patricia Arquette from part 3: Dream Warriors, and Laurence Fishburne (credited as Larry Fishburne) from part 3: Dream Warriors.

Other than that, pretty much everything is covered. Not only is the documentary chock full of information, but also loaded with clips of deleted and altered scenes, stories from cast and crew, and literally hundreds of behind the scene photographs.

For the price, this blu-ray set cannot be beat, especially if you're looking to learn more about the franchise or ""bookend"" you film collection.

Never Sleep Again comes packed in a 2-Disc Vortex case, and each disc has disc art on them. Disc one contains the four hour long feature presentation.

Disc two is chock full of even more goodies, including extended interviews, revisiting horrors Hallowed Grounds: Returning to Elm Street, a featurette regarding Freddy in comics and novels, The music of Nightmare on Elm Street, ""For The Love of the Glove,"" one Wisconsin man's obsession with Freddy's glove and the ones he's attained over the years (extremely impressive collection by the way), ""Fred Heads,"" a look at die-hard Nightmare fans, showing off their photographs, sculptures, memorabilia, and autographs, ANOES in 10 minutes (is exactly what it says it is),  ""Freddy Vs. The Angry Video Game Nerd"" a featurette where James Rolfe reflects on the Nightmare series and how it has affected him, as well as clips from his ""Nightmare"" episode, and ""I am Nancy,"" a look at Heather Lagenkamp's documentary on her experiences with the films.

All in all, it's a fantastic set, and a must have for any Nightmare on Elm Street fan.",1439596800,,2855,4.985294117647059

4125645,5,B003HFUVQI,"Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy is the best documentary I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot since I've seen lots of great ones.  On Disc One, there is the 4 hour documentary, then there is the commentary for the documentary.  On Disc Two, there are more extended interviews, videos on making the music, a tour of the area the original film was made, videos about the glove, videos about the fans of the series, a video of Freddy vs. the Angry Video Game Nerd, videos about the comics,  the trailer for the documentary, a sneak peak for Heather Langenkamp's documentary, I Am Nancy, a video with the poster designer from the original movie, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street in 10 Minutes"", which is the cast saying some of their most famous lines from the movies.

The people who made this documentary did a fantastic job and went in-depth on all 8 original movies and even the T.V. show, Freddy's Nightmares.  Narrated by Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy in 1, 3, and herself in 7.  There's a lot about the making and the special effects in it, and how each movie was made.  There isn't anything better than this when it comes to documentaries, and nothing can beat it.  The interviews were informative, the editing was great, there is nothing wrong with this.

4125672,5,B003HFUVQI,"It's now streaming on Netflix. Yahtzee! I'm 3 hours in and still can't get enough. I assumed 4 hours of documentary must be redundant but I was wrong. Each Freddy film is highlighted in great detail by those involved in their sequel and they go in order which is nice to see the progression of the franchise. What I love about this is that nobody is afraid to tell the hardships they encountered during production. They're all kindly candid and honest but not in a bashing way. When you have Robert England say New Line didn't pay very well but it was a ride you wanted to be on, how can you find this flat. They even talk about the low budget tv series which I wasn't aware of in the 80's. It's so awesome to see these guys talk about movies I grew up watching. Gotta love DVD and bonus material. I'd compare the depth of this to the Superman doc that came out a few years ago and had the cast/crew talk about the entire Superman saga from 1-4. I'm a behind the scenes junkie and Never Sleep Again is top notch. Will probably buy to see the added features.

UPDATE: Weeks have gone by and I'm digging into the bonus disc from the 2 disc set. Wow, more great interviews that were deleted and true feelings how everyone felt about the reboot, (not good). Seems the cut interviews have more dirt that maybe was taken out from the full doc cause of tone. There's deleted interviews from all films, (green screen behind them since they never made the final cut). Also here is a great look at a collector of several screen used gloves, as well as fans who make them, including more comments from cast & crew that were weaved in fitting the segment. One of the FX guys talks to the collector, looking over his gloves. This 2nd disc is badass on it's own and full of juicy material. Buy this fans, looks like it's gone up in price already.",1401148800,,1832,4.310144927536232

While watching the documentary, I noticed how many people the production team got to take part in the film, A LOT.  The quality of the discs and dvd package itself is nice and shiny.  Heather Lagenkamp is adorable.  There is also time spent on the making of the costumes.  A poster also comes in the jacket sleeve.  So for the price of a regular dvd, you get over four hours of footage.  On a side note, If you were a fan of the show ""Just the Ten of Us"", it is cool to see what the three actresses look like all these years later.",1400112000,,689,4.082089552238806

Beginning with Wes Craven's 1984 original film (obviously), this 238-minute documentary takes you through each film, book-ended by some great stop-motion animation between each segment. Ultimately, this doc covers the films and touches on the short-live television series, ""Freddy's Nightmares."" The blu-ray, however, features a second bonus disc that covers some of the merchandise, including replica gloves and the classic NES video game.

Every director is present and accounted for for each film, unlike the equally excellent ""Crystal Lake Memories"" where a few of the director's chose not to participate. Even most of the writers show up giving insight into unused scripts and storylines. ""Freddy vs. Jason"" benefits greatly in this area as several writers talk about their abandoned screenplays that nothing short of fascinating where some these writers wanted to take the film.

Overall, this is a great film that you'll be shocked you sat through the whole thing in one sitting. It never feels long or stretched with each film getting roughly the same allotted time. You'll never want to again for any information about Freddy or Elm Street with great film.",1393977600,2,1401,5.245535714285714

4125687,5,B003HFUVQI,"I'm a big fan of the Nightmare on elm st films, have been since the 80'S
after Nightmare 3, 4,5,6 are very ridiculous Nightmare 4,5,6 are more funny than they are scary
the best one is of course wes craven's classic which i still love to watch today
the 2nd and the 3rd Nightmare are just as Good but the first one is the best.

this Blu-ray release of NEVER SLEEP AGAIN is a re-issue of the DVD release from 2010
which i have anyway,
but on blu-ray all the interviews are in High Definition picture/audio quality this time
so this Blu-ray release is exactly the same as the DVD release from 2010

for fans that are new and just becoming a fan of the film series
this Documentary is incredible,
this Doco was made by the same writer/Director of the Camp crystal lake memories Documentary
which i definitely recommend getting if you also love the Friday the 13th series aswell

Each Nightmare on elm st film has a making of Documentary
so there's 7 Nightmare films which is 7 Documentaries or featurettes
plus the 8th Nightmare which is Freddy vs Jason which also has documentary
plus there is also a mini featurette on the Freddy's nightmares TV series that was broadcast for a few years

some featurettes are longer than others
the first 5 Nightmare Documentaries go for about 40-45mins each
each Film Doco has a chapter selection
nearly all Actors/actress's from all 7 films are interviewed in Depth
some of them have had film careers after the Nightmare on elm st film that they starred in and some of them havn't
so there are some actors/actress's i saw in this Doco i was shocked and suprised to see that
the Director got them for an interview

there's also interviews with the writers, Directors, special effects crew from each film
Incredible, incredible Documentary/featurettes, hours and hours worth of interviews
and that's just on Disc 1

Disc 2 has Extended interviews from Each Nightmare Doco
basically interview outtakes that did not make it on Disc 1
so there's more hours to watch of outtakes
some of these extended interviews have actors/Directors talking about fond memories that had from their experience
on the set, if your a big fan like myself you'll love the outtakes

there's a featurette on the Music of the elm st series, interviews with the music composers from Each film
very interesting
there's another Documentary on the Hardcore Freddy fan's
lots and lots of Freddy fan's interviewed
and more featurettes
basically all the special features and i mean all of them from the dvd release
are all on this blu-ray re-issue
so if you either buy this blu-ray re-issue or the old 2 disc dvd set from 4 years ago
you will get exactly the same material
the only difference is this blu-ray re-issue is in High definition, the DVD set is not.
but they're both worth the cash easily.
i gave this blu-ray 5 stars",1392508800,,2828,4.655310621242485

I had no idea how little I knew, until this documentary. Just about everybody alive makes an appearance (save for Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette being noticeably absent). Even Dokken shows up to talk about their song in Dream Warriors.

Topics like Wes Craven's disappointment with the franchise are addressed, but handled so tastefully. Often-rumored theories about story lines are addressed, continuity between Freddy's makeup is addressed... if you like the Nightmare series, the documentary is four hours of joy.",1391299200,,672,5.330188679245283
4125692,4,B003HFUVQI,"Do you love slasher films as much as I do? Do you find yourself blocking off every Friday the 13th off for screenings of Jason Voorhees' many killing sprees like it's a holiday? If you answered yes, chances are you love other movies in the genre such as ""Halloween,"" ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""The Burning,"" and others.

One of those ""others"" is a little franchise that goes by the name ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" The burned up and razor-gloved Freddy Krueger has come to be known as a member of what many would call the horror trinity. The other two members of this infamous trio are the hockey-masked Voorhees and creepy William Shatner-faced Michael Myers.

Having already tackled the ""Friday the 13th"" series through his extensive documentary ""Crystal Lake Memories,"" Director Daniel Farrands teamed up with Editor Andrew Kasch to provide the same service for fans of the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise. Together, the two helm a 238-minute journey behind-the-scenes of this equally terrifying and fun bunch of films with ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy."" Thanks to RLJ and Image Entertainment, the documentary is now available on Blu-ray.

""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"" is made up of interviews with the actors from the films including Freddy himself, Robert Englund. Each one shares their insights on the different entries they starred in. Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy in the original film, narrates the entire documentary. As suspected, much of the footage is HD-video and there's not much to complain about as far as picture quality goes.

A DTS-HD MA 2.0 stereo mix is what's provided for ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy."" Since most of the film is individual interviews, that's all you really need. It's not like we're being immersed in an action/adventure film with stuff blowing up all around us.

""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"" is packed with bonus material. Commentary is provided by Directors Andrew Kasch and Daniel Farrands, Writer Thommy Hutson, and Cinematographer Buz Danger Wallick. There are also extended interviews and seven featurettes that cover everything from collecting to the musical scores to the comic books. A first look at Heather Langenkamp's autobiographical documentary, entitled ""I Am Nancy,"" is provided as well. We also get the fun ""'A Nightmare on Elm Street' in 10 Minutes"" clip collection and a teaser trailer.

Passing fans of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" might find ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"" a bit tedious and long-winded for their taste. However, hardcore Freddy fanatics will find themselves camped out on the couch for hours taking in all the captivating background information on one of the three largest horror franchises in the world. Just hope you don't accidentally drift off into dreamland while watching it all!",1391040000,,2840,5.109913793103448
4125693,5,B003HFUVQI,"The first thing that the film gets right is its length. This is a four-hour film, basically, and the time is split pretty evenly between all seven films in the original franchise, as well as a bit of time devoted to merchandising and the Freddy's Nightmares TV series. Each entry gets roughly a half-hour, which is enough time to go into a decent amount of depth without losing momentum. Each of the sections has a similar structure as well, so we hear about the writing process, the casting process, the production, and then the impact of the film financially. Each film also gets its own special section where a unique aspect is discussed. For instance, the film addresses the homosexual undertones of the first sequel, or the participation of Dokken in Dream Warriors.

The second thing the film gets right is the set of interviewees. The vast majority of significant players is included, from Wes Craven himself, to Bob Shaye (head of New Line), to almost all of the stars, including the all-important Robert Englund. Special effects guys are included in the list as well, and all have something interesting to say about their participation. More importantly, they're willing to be critical of something aspects of the film, their production, as well as their fellow interviewees. Though this is hardly a case of character assassination, people do express disappointments about budgets, production decisions, and various other things. It keeps the film balanced and engaging.

If those four hours aren't enough for you, you get a whole host of extras to help sate your need for all things Nightmare. Things kick off with a commentary by directors Andrew Kasch and Daniel Farrands, writer Thommy Hutson, and cinematographer Buz Danger Wallick. The quartet are surprisingly engages throughout the running time, sharing info about the genesis of the project, how they wrangled the participants, and the problems they encountered along the way. Then, on the second disc, we get another 100 minutes of interviews, which play out like a mini version of the full film, organized by each entry in the franchise. Then, we get a host of featurettes that cover everything from Freddy's iconic glove to the composers of the franchise's music. It's a great way to see details that didn't quite fit into the interview format of the feature, and hardcore fans will probably find more new info in these featurettes. The film's trailer is also included.
Upgrading from the standard DVD might be a bit of a disappointment. The 1.78:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is fine, but not spectacular. The big problem is one of compression, as all four hours of video and two audio tracks are included on the first disc. There's a bit of artefacting in some shots, though it's not terrible. Skin colors can be a bit all over the place, though that's probably more about the lighting conditions on set. Black levels tend to drop off a bit, going from bright lights to complete darkness very quickly. That means people's heads can sometimes appear to be swimming in black. It's a totally watchable transfer, and if this is your first time out with the documentary then this will look good. However, those who already own the DVD probably won't want to upgrade just for the video. Audio is a bit better, with all the interviews and production footage perfectly clear in this DTS-HD 2.0 stereo mix. This isn't intended to be a showy mix, but the important stuff is all there.

Sadly, Johnny Depp wasn't interviewed (though he appears briefly in an excerpt from Inside the Actor's Studio), and neither Ronnie Blakely nor Patricia Arquette is onboard either. The latter is especially disappointing, since no one can really provide a definitive answer as to why she didn't return for The Dream Master. Ultimately I think the absence of a few figures is understandably and doesn't ding the film at all, but those hoping for a complete collection of interviews might be slightly disappointed.

Never Sleep Again is also in a weird place. As a four-hour documentary about a film franchise, it's not aimed at the casual viewer. Still, the casual viewers is the one who stands to gain the most from the film. As someone who watched all the extras on that old Nightmare box set, I didn't really learn anything from Never Sleep Again. I don't think that's a problem, since I enjoyed the journey even though I knew the destination. However, those hoping for new revelations or fresh gossip won't find a whole lot here.

4125696,5,B003HFUVQI,"This DVD set really goes behind the scenes and gets in depth with the creation of the entire Elm St saga! They managed to interview mostly everyone who starred in the films (Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette were unfortunately not on it and greatly missed!)
They covered pretty much every aspect from the initial creation by Wes Craven all the way to the TV series and beyond. The extras on disc 2 were completely worth the purchase as well. Extended interviews. Dokken's music video from Nightmare on Elm St: The Dream Warriors, even discussions about graphic novels that I never knew existed!!
This was well worth the money and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is something I watch again and again.",1390521600,,700,4.699186991869919

4125698,5,B003HFUVQI,"It is a must see for any Nightmare on Elm Street fan.

4125701,5,B003HFUVQI,"This is easily one of the most complete documentaries that has ever been created for any movie series.  Made before the 2010 reboot, this expansive behind the scenes look at the Nightmare series leaves few stones unturned.  Other than a couple expected holdouts (Johnny Depp, Patricia Arquette, Laurence Fishburne), the makers of this doc go to exhaustive lengths to involve as many former cast and crew members as possible.  Directors, screenwriters, special affects and make-up artists have all been included to recall their memories from making the films.  It's really interesting to see a lot of these actors and their reactions to their experiences.  Most seem very proud to be a part of the series, which is a really fun thing to watch.  Fans of the series also get to see a lot of never before seen pictures and footage from the films.  If you're at all interested in these movies, this is a must own for all Freddy fans!!",1382572800,,929,4.76875
4125702,5,B003HFUVQI,"The most complete documentary you will ever need about the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. This is how you make documentaries, unlike the empty Halloween documentary from 2006 that offers nothing in the way of depth, this documentary doesn't skip stones across the pond. It offers insight from 90% of the cast and crew who were there and made their case of love and respect for the film(s) they worked on. They loved it even if it wasn't the strongest film in the series, their feelings were honest and reflective about their part in making film franchise history.
A new Friday the 13th documentary is coming out with the same producers who made this documentary entitled, ""Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th"". I can't wait! Hopefully we can get these same producers to tackle a decent Michael Myers Halloween Documentary. The last Halloween documentary of 2006 was a woeful attempt at fandom adoration. Michael deserves better - it's his turn next.",1379116800,2,980,4.945454545454545

4125704,5,B003HFUVQI,"When I first saw this, I was blown away by how in depth they got into each film. At least 45 minutes each one. The FREDDY'S NIGHTMARES one was like 4 to 5 minutes long. But it was still cool. The cool little stories such as Peter Jackson writing a draft for part 6 and David Warner originally being cast as Freddy Krueger are just 2 of many great stories to hear about. As compared to HALLOWEEN: 25 YEARS OF TERROR and HIS NAME WAS JASON: 30 YEARS OF FRIDAY THE 13TH, this beats those 2 to death. In terms of quality and interviews. Also, I got to talk with the producer Mike Perez about this documentary when I bought MORE BRAINS!: A RETURN TO THE LIVING DEAD from him. He told me that Johnny Depp was interested in being interviewed but Johnny was in tight schedule for doing publicity tours for Tim Burton's 2010 re-imagining of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. He said that Patricia Arquette was going to be in it but she at the last minute who shoot the final episodes of MEDIUM, I believe. He didn't say anything about why Laurence Fishburne, Brian Helgeland, Frank Darabont or Breckin Meyer weren't interviewed. Don't hang around, go buy this NOW!!! Here's a list of some people who get interviewed:

Robert Englund (obviously)

4125711,5,B003HFUVQI,I strongly recommend this dvd for any horror movie fan or Elm Street fan. My sister who is far from a horror fan was fascinated with the documentary. You learn a lot about the behind the scenes of the making of these films. There is a good amount of time spent on each movie in the series. It's a very interesting and in depth documentary. You get to hear from most of the actors in the films. Patricia Arguette and Johnny Depp are MIA.,1359331200,,436,4.2023809523809526

4125717,5,B003HFUVQI,"Incredible! There isn't anything missing in this excellent feature about every film in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise (although the reboot is quickly dismissed). This DVD packs over 4 hours of interviews with each segment of roughly equal length dedicated to each film. There is even a bonus disc full of extras. None of the interviews drag on because of the fantastic editing and cutting. The additional material is also very interesting viewing. The narrative provided by Heather Langenkamp flows well. The documentary flows in chronological order, starting with the original Nightmare on Elm Street. This feature is so large I have highlighted some memories below.

[Part 1] It has received the most attention in other DVD releases and it's still a classic.
[Part 2] It was fun seeing old favorites like Robert Rusler (""Coach Schneider, like Jesse, had some secrets"") and Marshall Bell (""The coach's balls being used in the attack..."").
[Part 3] Discussion of Patricia Arquette's absence is given due respect.
[Part 4] Some of these segments are hilarious to me, with Sagoes exclaiming, ""What are we going to say? Hey Bob Shaye we want to be in the whole movie,"" after his 8-minute disappearance in Nightmare 4. The behind the scenes romances on Nightmare 4 also got out of hand.
[Part 5-9] There is something of an apology for Nightmare 5 and beyond, as Katz notes most fans felt the series was in decline after Part 5. Freddy's Dead and New Nightmare remain misunderstood by many but there is no attempt to sugarcoat the films. The reboot isn't given any respect.

The spirit of the creators, cast and crew is upbeat, positive and meaningful. Hilarious and eye-opening trivia with quick cuts make this a very entertaining experience. Never Sleep Again is refreshingly honest, fan-based and comprehensive as it sets the gold standard for horror documentaries and documentaries of all types. Now if only we could get a book like Crystal Lake Memories for the Nightmare franchise. There are so many interviews it's remarkable that over 40 people signed on to appear in this project! Honestly, if you haven't picked up Never Sleep Again already you might like the idea that almost the entire cast and crew are here. They are all ""real"" and discuss behind the scenes events, working relationships, fan feedback and much more in a surprisingly candid manner. If you are a fan of the Nightmare franchise or horror films you won't be disappointed.

Buy this DVD! Amazon reviewers wisely give it a 5-star rating.",1351036800,,2520,4.966824644549763

People don't know,esp since this is a Franchise,how many marathons you can do with these,lol. With friends,fam,or just a chilly weekend,it really is an investment into not only the films,but the actors,and you always hope that they are well off and ok,after the role ends. I can't thank Heather,Wes,ROB(who I ADORE) and the whole NOES team for participating in this,and remembering the fans that built the legacy up!",1348185600,,577,4.8979591836734695
4125719,5,B003HFUVQI,"I was so happy that I got this documentary for under $20. It was worth way more than that! I've seen every sequel to Nightmare on Elm Street, and have loved them all. This is a 2-Disc DVD that has SO much interesting stuff! The first DVD takes you through the making of each movie and does cast/producer/director interviews, shows you pictures and actual footage of when they were making the movie, and everyone is just so honest and open on how they felt about working with everyone. It's a few hours long, but once you start watching it, you can't stop!

The second disc offers a TON of stuff! More in-depth interviews from each movie, movie extras, etc. I haven't even finished the second disc, but I already love it!

If you're not a true Nightmare fan, then you may not find this as interesting as others. However, if you are, I HIGHLY recommend this documentary!!! Fast delivery, good entertainment, and a good price!!",1341705600,,924,4.593939393939394
4125720,5,B003HFUVQI,"I really do, but I don't like how the producers and actors were talking about the second movie like it was trash. The second one was one of the best in my opinion, so they should just suck it up and take pride in it - after all, it made money just like the others. Anyway, that's the only part I hate, the rest of the documentary is great. They talk about every single individual movie for at least fifteen - twenty minutes, and all the actors are there giving commentary for the most part (except for Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette).",1340150400,,537,4.2745098039215685
4125721,5,B003HFUVQI,"This is a great documentary summarizing the life of one of the most infamous serial killers in cinema history, Mr. Fred Krueger.  From the first Nightmare film to Freddy vs. Jason, ""Never Sleep Again"" covers every crack, corner and crevice of Freddy's legacy.  Every film is broken down and dissected with interviews from various actors, actresses, writers, producers and even New Line Cinema executives.  It even goes in depth with the ""Freddy's Nightmares"" TV show, which before watching this, I barely knew anything about.  I love how most of Freddy's famous kills are broken down and explained in detail about how they were filmed, great stuff.  Just seeing the impact and celebrity icon that Freddy became is just unbelieveable.  I learned so much from this film and it's definitely worth the hefty price.  I highly recommend this to every ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fan or horror film fan in general.  Without hesitation, ""Never Sleeps Again"" definitely blows ""His Name was Jason"" and ""Halloween: 25 Years of Terror"" straight out of the water.",1335484800,,1048,5.0523255813953485

I loved how this film goes in order with each Kruger film and spends quite a long time on each one, talking about everything from sets, charactors, actors, fun facts, directors,and even the writers.

4125726,5,B003HFUVQI,Never Sleep Again is a great documentary for fans of the Elm Street series. Lots of cast and crew interviews. Just very cool. If you love Freddy I highly recommend this documentary.,1320019200,,181,4.6875
4125727,5,B003HFUVQI,"This fascinating documentary, hosted by original ""Nightmare"" heroine Heather Langenkamp and featuring interviews with over 100 more people, gives you the complete history of the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" series; beginning with the original, classic ""Nightmare"" in 1984 all the way to ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" in 2003. Running near 4 hours, the documentary never drags for an instant; because the behind-the-scenes stories are completely engrossing.
  New Line Cinema began as a small film distribution company. New Line gambled on a truly frightening script from director Wes Craven (""The Last House On The Left"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"") and the rest is horror film history.  British actor David Warner was originally cast as child molester/teen dream murderer Freddy Krueger. A scheduling conflict forced Warner to drop out. Robert Englund stepped in and quickly achieved icon status as the latter-day boogeyman in the seven film series. Unfortunately, in order to get the original ""Nightmare"" financed, Wes Craven had to sell the rights to the characters he created to New Line. New Line, having nothing else in their  pipeline, began releasing ""Nightmare"" sequels on increasingly tighter production scheduels with increasingly smaller production budgets. This led, of course, to an uneven quality in the overall ""Nightmare"" series.
  The documentary is right on target in assessing what went right, and terribly wrong (""Nightmare On Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"" and ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"") in the series.  Nothing could be more infamous, perhaps, than the disasterously homophobic ""Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge."" I love how key people involved in ""Nightmare 2"" play coy and pretend they had no idea the script had a homosexual subtext. Hey, get a clue: in this case, the subtext is text. At least openly gay actor Mark Patton, who portrayed the Freddy-possessed and tormented teen Jesse, knew exactly what was going on. In an interview, Patton sadly states that Hollywood is an extremely homophobic town, and homosexuals in Hollywood are some of the most homophobic of them all.  Patton furthur relates that he quickly left Hollywood and lived a very happy life, thank God.
  ""Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" was an innovative return to top form for the series, although there was incredible tension between New Line  and novice film director Chuck Russell. By the time Renny Harlin directed ""Nightmare On Elm Street 4: Dream Master"" (featuring several memorable dream sequences and a strong central performance by Lisa Wilcox), Freddy Krueger had become more funny than frightening.
Original ""Nightmare"" director Wes Craven went a long ways toward righting the wrongs comitted in previous installments; returning Freddy to his horrorfying orgins in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare."" Still, the series concluded with a slam-bang, balls-to-the wall brawl between New Line's two terror titans in ""Freddy VS. Jason.""
  Disc 2 provides even more, exploring Freddy's incarnations in other media, including graphic novels and  comic books, and the ultra-low budget TV anthology ""Freddy's Nightmares."" Best of all, key actors re-inact the entire ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" film series in ten minutes. Not to be missed-- highly recommended for all ""Nightmare"" fans.",1314662400,2,3290,5.3879142300194935
4125728,5,B003HFUVQI,"In my opinion this move was as indepth as you could get with a documentary about some 30 years of film. Each movie had a VERY long segment, most enjoyable was ""Nightmare 2"". It brought to the forefront a lot of memories of things I didn't even realize or understand as a kid.

If you are a fan of this series or a person that just wants the low down of everyone's favorite boogeyman on elm street. This is for you.  Enjoy.",1301529600,,422,4.134146341463414
4125729,5,B003HFUVQI,"The double discs will keep you busy for hours. The first disc clocks in just under four hours and it's all interviews with various cast and crew from all the Nightmare movies. Each movie has a chapter dedicated to it as well as the TV series, Freddy's Nightmares

The second disc has some great extra interview material not shown on the first disc. There are also sections discussing the Nightmares outside the films in different spin-off novels and comics. Another section interviews various composers that have contributed to the franchise.

If you can't get enough Elm Street, this is the DVD you need.",1297123200,,605,4.864077669902913

For the record, however: NEVER SLEEP AGAIN is the special that the BIO channel airs around Halloween (under the name, ""Inside Story: Nightmare on Elm Street""). I've seen the special on BIO and was hoping this might be something different, but it's the same (although, it's longer, as certain things were cut from the BIO presentation to air on TV).

Regarding the quality of this documentary itself, it is absolutely wonderful. Almost everybody comes together to talk about their experiences making the movies, and you get to see a lot of behind-the-scenes pictures and a couple videos, as well as the creation of Freddy Krueger from Wes Craven himself.

Every place I went, the movie was gone and the price to pre-order it was insane. The film is very informative. It will show the time line of the entire series, but there is something about the Documentary that really interests me. Instead of being a movie that loves the series, it shows the mistakes that were made. It shows how the popularity of the film series, of any film series, could destroy that series. This is for any Nightmare fan who not only wants to not the technical aspect of the films, but how the story was made, what the crews went through and most importantly, how Freddy evolved along with society. I strongly recommend this film especially if you have four hours to watch this film.",1295481600,,807,4.496598639455782

They talk about everything that went into each of the Nightmare films and then some. The disc is broken up into chapters that correspond with each movie in the series. They interview pretty much every one of the main characters that came out in these movies and really get to the bottom of some interesting and funny facts that you may have never know about prior. There's really too much good stuff to talk about here, but if you are a Nightmare fan, there is no reason why you shouldn't have this in your collection.",1294531200,,622,4.3247863247863245

In a nutshell, this is a comprehensive and detailed look at not only what went on behind the scenes while making the Nightmare films, but it's full of great interviews with actors and crew. We get to learn what everyone involved experienced before, during and after being in their respective films and it is absolutely riveting!

Special mention has to go to Heather Langenkamp for her work and dedication on this project!

It's impossible to be a fan and not love this!",1290470400,,556,4.54

It's great to see the behind the scenes stuff, hear the stories of on set jokes, disasters and issues and of course see how everyone looks now.  Loved the stuff with the Freddy's Revenge cast and it was comical from beginning to end.  This DVD is loaded with over 8 hours of Elm Street extras and is a must own for any fan of the franchise.",1288224000,12,596,4.333333333333333
4125737,5,B003HFUVQI,"Never Sleep Again is an extensive, exhaustive, and epic documentary on the Nightmare on Elm Street film series.  A documentary epic?  Yes!  Coming in at just under four hours, its more than enough to sate the thirst of any Freddy Krueger fan.  Hosted by Elm Street star Heather Langenkamp, Never Sleep Again features interviews with every one of the Directors and nearly every cast member from the series, with a few notable exceptions.

The documentary begins with creator Wes Craven and New Line Cinema founder and former head Bob Shaye discussing the evolution of the first film.  Charlie Sheen was originally considered for the role that went to Johnny Depp and David Warner was the original choice to play Freddy...How bizarre would that have been!  It's well documented throughout the four hours at just how much Craven and Shaye were at odds with each other.  Craven particularly did not want the shock ending that Shaye insisted upon.  This would begin a feud between the two that would last for years.

Much of the discussion of Nightmare on Elm Street part 2 centers on the homoerotic subtext of the film and especially of lead character Jesse Walsh.  Most of the cast and crew claim they had no idea about the allusions the film was sending.  One note of interest, again in the casting, is that both Brad Pitt and Christian Slater were considered for the role of Jesse.

The segment on Nightmare Part 3 includes interviews with all of the actors who played the kids in the hospital (except for Patricia Arquette).  Most of the budget went towards special effects and included one of the series most memorable kills as a TV sprouts arms and slams one of the patient's heads through the television screen.  But we also learn that Nightmare 3 was a very tense shoot and behind schedule the entire way.  A big tip of the hat for the producers for including an interview with metal band Dokken who provided one of the most memorable film songs of the 1980s with ""Dream Warriors"".

The film goes on to cover every succeeding film in the series including Craven's return for Wes Craven's New Nightmare, after patching things up with Shaye, Freddy Vs. Jason. And even the short-lived Freddy's Nightmares TV series.  While there's unfortunately no Johnny Depp or Patricia Arquette, the rest of the cast, including John Saxon, all look back fondly on their roles.  For New Line, the series was a cash cow and put them on the map.  The interviews are all conducted individually which gives them a personal feel.  Most of these actors have not gone on to become major stars...some haven't even acted since their Nightmare on Elm Street days and so they are not the least bit pretentious in their recollections.

Never Sleep Again is an incredible, masterful documentary.  There's some great stories of near set disasters such as the giant Freddy torso built that fell over, spilling crew members, and of the explosion in Freddy Vs. Jason that was too close for comfort to actress Monica Keena. It's an all Freddy, all the time extravaganza and one of the best documentaries in a long time.

DVD Extras

Now, if four hours on Elm Street wasn't enough for you then pop in the bonus disc for another four hours of extras.  The Extended Interviews provide another 100 minutes of interviews on the series including the new 2010 remake.  Almost unanimously, all of those interviewed about the remake are unhappy about it.  Frankly it comes off as a bit of sour grapes since Craven and Shaye had no say on the project but Nightmare is no more a classic than Halloween or Friday the 13th and both of those have been remade...for better or worse.  The segment on Freddy Vs. Jason is one of the best in the extended interviews because you get to hear some of the story pitches from other writers who wrote drafts for the film and they are really quite fascinating.  It's also interesting to note that the film almost didn't happen because Jason X did so poorly at the box office.

Other extras include segments on the creation of Freddy's infamous glove; Nightmare on Elm Street in novels and comic books; the poster art of the films; a look at Freddy Fans known as ""Fred Heads""; and a return to the original Nightmare on Elm Street home.  And look hard enough and you will find an Easter Egg.",1286841600,2,4282,4.690763052208835
4125738,4,B003HFUVQI,"I was very impressed with how this documentary was put together. I found it as an essential supplement to any Elm Street fan and to go nicely alongside the film collection. You pretty much get nearly every star who's appeared in the series (except for the major ones) who recall their tales of experiencing the films at the time.

Not only do you just get a mention of each film in the series but you also pretty much get the entire anthology. This essentially includes information on Freddy Vs. Jason, the abysmal Freddy's Nightmares TV series, the franchise and the rise & fall of Newline Cinema.

Most of what I covered is just the tip of the iceberg for disc one! The second disc is mainly short featurettes on either additional parts not covered on the first disc or location tributes and the such alike.

Overall this is an essential buy if you are an Elm Street fan and looking for something up to date on how the franchise is today.",1284336000,,940,4.485380116959064

The fact that they relied so heavily on the success of A Nightmare On Elm Street to make the company of New Line, and now look at it...just goes to show you that all it takes is one good idea and someone to believe in it...put all of themselves into it and just hope it works.
This 2-disc set has all one who's a Fredhead could ask for, if you don't have it...get it.

4125743,5,B003HFUVQI,"I loved this dvd. Ive been an avid Nightmare on Elm St fan since as far back as i can remember and ive always wanted a dvd like this to come along. Its cool how they made these doc dvds for the two other reigning horror titans (fans know which im speaking of), but they saved the best for last (like so many lying ad campains for the friday the 13th series). Really anything you could possibly care to know abt these movies is explored, and if they withheld any info, maybe bc warner n new line aren't finished milking us fans quite yet. i suppose until they release a proper unrated cut of nightmare five the quest is never ending. Fantastic doc though, if i were too name any critisms, some of the key actors from alot of the sequels didn't show up ( could Craig Wasson have really been that busy he couldn't give up an hour to talk) but other than that, and the length, i cant really think of anything negative to say. I mean i love the fact that they gave us four hours of wonderful info and insight, its hard to take in one sitting after already viewed. Still tho its irrevelavnt. IF your even reading my review or have come to this page then you have a love for everyones fav psychotic sandman, so answer this, Do u love nightmare on elm enough to warrant 8 hours of freddy filled fun? Of course you do, so pick this up asap! One more thing, props to amazon for even having this bc i absolutely couldn't find this in any store in western pennsylvania, which was annoying bc i swear i looked in every store that would carry dvds in western pa, but it was a great moment when i pulled this from my mailbox. this was my first review, so keep that in mind.",1279929600,2,1658,4.184375

My ONLY complaint was that they couldn't get Johnny Depp or Patricia Arquette to comment which is sad since the Nightmare series launched their careers. Oh well.

The Nightmare Series encyclopedia on the boxed DVD set of all the films does have some on the meaning of the films and the characters, and the special edition infinifilm DVD of the first movie has some great documentaries on dreams and the meanings thereof.

A four hour main feature supplemented by about four more hours of special features proves that there's a lot to be discussed, reminisced about and covered here. As has been pointed out, you won't see Johnny Depp (except for a brief clip from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-the-Actors-Studio-Johnny-Depp/dp/B000N2HDJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside the Actors Studio: Johnny Depp</a>) or Patricia Arquette in here, but they're fondly remembered as well (Laurence Fishburne is never mentioned though). The actors present themselves by reading their character's own introduction from the script, which is a very nice touch. If you're a fan and have been keeping up with special editions, there will be some of the same ground covered, but there's a lot of new stuff here, including death scenes we've never known about (at least I hadn't, but I can only speak for myself). It should be pointed out that it's all about the main series though, the only mention of this year's remake is covered briefly in the extra interviews, since it's clearly (and understandably) a taboo subject with the makers of the original classic. Don't expect any interviews with Rooney Mara, Jackie Earle Haley or Katie Cassidy in this one.

The special features are plentiful and satisfying, and there's a lot more humor to be had here (the Horror's Hallowed Grounds episode with Amanda and Heather is great, and the sneak peek of her own I Am Nancy-documentary is hilarious and light-hearted). There are also two featurettes on the dedicated fans; one introducing the many craftsmakers (and websites) providing replica Freddy gloves (about a dozen or so, wow), and one on the dedication of the true hardcore fans, sharing some of their fanart and memorabilia. The authors and artists behind Nightmare-books and comics share their ideas and thoughts on expanding the universe, and there's also a ""Nightmare on Elm Street in 10 minutes""-featurette where almost everyone that was interviewed provide their most famous lines in chronological order.

Overall it's a great and very satisfying documentary, there's hardly any need for an ""Elm Street Memories""-book now. A word of warning though, make sure to boil some coffee or get some energy drink if you're planning to watch it all in one sitting, or you might nod off and he'll come for you..",1274832000,2,2844,5.581018518518518
4125759,5,B003HFUVQI,"If you never sleep again, it will only be because you are too busy sifting through all that ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"" has to offer.

Beginning with Wes Craven's original film and wrapping up with the 2003 hit mash-up, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason</a>,"" the documentary brings back most of the main cast and crew from each film (sans major players such as Patricia Arquette, Laurence Fishburne and Johnny Depp) as they wax nostalgic about all of the fun, thrills, melodrama, successes and failures that ""Elm Street"" brought each and every one of them. Each film is given ample time and is expanded upon wonderfully, and not only is it a blast to see how some of them have aged, but a lot of new information is brought to the forefront that, even if you've followed the series throughout the decades, will come as news to you. This certainly is no fluff-piece, as everyone is open and honest, and in spite of its length, it never drags or feels dull.

Once you've plowed through the main feature, there's still a second disc of special features to swallow, and as before, there is not a moment wasted. The main meat of this disc is a compilation of extended interviews that runs almost as long as the average ""Elm Street"" flick. If you simply can't get enough after the four hours you've just completed, this piece serves almost as a fitting desert. Other features focus on Freddy phenomena such as the character's transition into comics, the music that was used in the series, locations, props and, of course, the fans. There's also a rather amusing bit with the famed Angry Video Game Nerd where he rips apart the Nintendo game based on the franchise, albeit, in a loving manner. There's so much here that it almost justifies its own release.

While the release glosses over the recent remake (save for a few minutes of cut footage), it doesn't spare anything from the Robert Englund golden-era. Those who remember how great this series was in its time will no doubt eat up each and every savory morsel that ""Never Sleep Again"" has to offer. You're certainly getting the bang for your buck, and even if the studio itself isn't too keen on producing something this informative, it's good to know that independent film-makers with a love for the material are willing to do all the leg-work themselves.

Daniel Farrands is no stranger to the horror genre and has been covering ""making ofs"" of such films as Friday the 13th part 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, as well as ""His Name was Jason"" a documentary on the Friday the 13th films, ""Scream: The Inside Story,"" as well as the writer of ""Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers,"" and writer/director of his magnum opus ""Crystal Lake Memories.""

8397092,5,B003HFUVQI,"The behind-the-scenes story of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" from its low-budget, troubled birth all the way through each sequel, TV series, and the mountain of merchandise, is told brilliantly by the actors, writers, producers, directors, SFX crews, and numerous other contributors in this four hour long documentary movie that belongs on the shelf of every Freddy Krueger fan. The sheer amount of material that you get on this two-disc set is remarkable. After watching the movie itself, you have a ton of supplemental material that look at subjects such as super-fans, video games, special effects, music, and a great deal more. For fifteen bucks, it's impossible to argue with the value of this set, which looks great in high-def and should satisfy all but the most demadning of Elm Street afficionados. Outstanding.",1506902400,,819,5.165413533834586
