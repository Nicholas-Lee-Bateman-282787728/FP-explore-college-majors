4522971,5,B0051MKNKO,"I just finished this work out and had to post a review. It was so much fun! I have been looking for a cardio workout that didn't have weights and that wasn't from Bob Harper, Jillian Michaels, or another trainer who ""yells"" and tells me to ""tough it out"". I have those workout DVDs, and I put them in rotation and do my time ""toughing it out"", but some days, I need a break from their... let's say, intense verbal motivation... and I just want to do something fun. I bought this DVD hoping it would be an enjoyable cardio workout, and I'm so glad I did! I was moving, sweating, laughing, and having a great time. I almost wanted to start it over again when it was finished! The moves are fairly easy to master and the trainer is very likeable. Is it the hardest workout I've ever done? No. But it was exactly what I was looking for and it will definitely be added into my regular workout DVD rotation.

As a frame of reference, I'd say my fitness level is now right now is a bit higher than that of a beginner, but I'm not quite comfortably intermediate. So if you are more advanced, you might not get much out of this workout, but if you are in my position - starting to get back into shape and looking for something to break up the monotony of the ""tough trainers"" - I'd highly recommend this DVD.",1326240000,19,1299,4.216867469879518
4522972,4,B0051MKNKO,"This DVD is a workout DVD, and not a true belly dance DVD. If you are looking to begin learning belly dance, this is not the DVD for you. If you are looking for a workout incorporating belly dance-type and Bollywood-esque styles, you may enjoy this.

Out of curiosity, I bought it and watched through it, and was, myself, disappointed, with how little belly dance there is in it. However, it does look like a fun (if not challenging for the agility-impaired, like myself! ;-P) workout, and I do look forward to giving it a shot.",1326067200,4,528,4.5

4522985,3,B0051MKNKO,"Not bad. It gets your heart rate up, which I guess is the main thing. However I think it's a bit much to fast for me",1427500800,,116,3.5

4522990,5,B0051MKNKO,"I really like this.  I've never belly danced before nor am I big on exercise videos so this is probably for beginners, but I did enjoy it.",1410652800,,138,4.111111111111111
4522991,4,B0051MKNKO,"I like this work out video it really does make you sweat. Though it said you are going to dance, you really don't its more like a general workout video where they teach you step by step how to move. But its still really fun and a good work out, and it works within a week or so I had already seen improvement in my waistline. Of course it takes a lot of commitment. Up to you of you want to give it a try it is fun, but just remember it really isn't dancing.",1409356800,,458,3.831578947368421
4522992,4,B0051MKNKO,"This is a very fun workout with interesting dance moves, it keeps you moving for 45 minutes. I worked up a sweat and the steps were fairly easy to learn. I highly recommend starting with the step guide before attempting the exercises. It's extremely helpful! The majority of the workout focuses on your core/ab section with some nice arm movements added in. The video includes a beginning warm-up, 3 separate routines, and a cool down at the end. Kili Marti is an excellent instructor. She gives clear verbal and physical cues before and during each routine. This video is an exercise routine with belly dance & Bollywood ""inspired"" movements, not an actual belly dance instruction. If you watch the video clip here on the product page, you'll see the dancers wearing sneakers. Both belly dance & Bollywood are performed barefoot. I recommend this video for a fun workout that's a little different than the average ""aerobic"" styled routine.",1398297600,2,940,4.955696202531645
4522993,1,B0051MKNKO,I would not recommend this DVD to anyone cause it is a complete waste of time and money. Perhaps My wife and I will never use this anymore. Does anyone have a suggestion of what to do with it? The players are less than amateurs...,1398124800,,230,4.133333333333334
4522994,4,B0051MKNKO,This really is a fun workout.  Cardio sucks if you don't find a way to make it enjoyable and this is enjoyable.  I feel it in my abs the next day!,1393718400,4,146,3.6774193548387095
4522995,5,B0051MKNKO,This is a fun easy work out! It is a little different and not that hard to do. If you need something to break up your work outs this would be it!,1366761600,,145,3.5625
4522996,2,B0051MKNKO,"I did not enjoy this workout routine at all. Granted, I am less than graceful when it comes to dancing and learning dance steps, but I felt even more like I had two left feet than usual with this dvd compared to other belly dancing and workout dvd's. This made me feel frustrated and I noticed that I was not keeping proper form because I was struggling to keep up with the steps. I feel like this made for a pretty ineffective workout. And yes, I did the step guide in full before the workout and it didn't help much. Only some of the moves are covered in the step guide.

I also really didn't care for all of the Bollywood flavor in all three routines. I feel like Belly Dance should be sensual and still a great workout focusing on the abs and hips - not so much hopping around and stomping while doing strange things with your hands.

It also drives me crazy how the camera man shot so many close ups of the upper body, right at critical moments when you need to see what the heck they're doing with their feet. I have noticed that other workout videos tend to do this as well though.

I will say that I did work up a pretty good sweat and probably burned quite a few calories. It is definitely a fast paced cardio routine, but none of my muscles - including my abs - feel sore or targeted like I would like. I would not recommend this unless you really want a BOLLYWOOD workout.",1366675200,,1383,4.19172932330827
4522997,5,B0051MKNKO,if you don't want to be bored in your workout -this is great dvd to add to your collection.  keeps you going.,1362268800,6,109,3.9545454545454546
4522998,5,B0051MKNKO,Great service and product.  Family enjoys doing this together.  So if you want something the whole family can participate in this is the one.,1359504000,2,141,4.833333333333333
4522999,5,B0051MKNKO,"I am 50 years old and have walked 4 miles every day for years and I needed to incorporate another workout regiment that somewhat challenged me from my stomach up including my arms and I have to say,  I love this video by Keli M. It is the perfect workout video with belly dancing moves mixed in, creating a nice not overly done cardio plus learning some sensual dance moves that you will pick up with each time you do it(takes about 5 to 6 times but eventually you perfect them all).  I keep looking for more of her workouts but haven't been able to find any so if anyone knows where to get more of Keli M's workout vids, please let me know.  This video does create a sweat and is so much fun working out with the girls (that's what I call them lol).  I am a normal averagely built woman and it has helped me tone up my midsection and arms and even helped my legs when I do it on a regular basis which is about 4 times a week.  Please don't listen to those others who have negative comments,  (they are probably the owners of the other vids on here lol and they are jealous! LOL )  Girls this one is so good,it is sold through out the United States at Walmarts and other big stores where as the others are not~~~Buy and keep at it until you get the moves down.",1356652800,12,1260,4.076923076923077
4523000,1,B0051MKNKO,"Will not allow me to give it ZERO stars!

Dance Off the Inches?  No way
Belly Dance?  Not on my DVD
Get fit with the shake of your hips?  I totally missed any hip shaking
3 Dance Routines?  No!  There is a warm up, a cool down and a middle which they call the work out, and none are actually dance anything, but certainly not 3 dance routines!

What I did find was what I think was 6 moves done OVER AND OVER AGAIN, might have been even 7 moves.  Much better excercise, dance and belly dance videos on youtube.com  Would really like to return it!",1355184000,7,546,4.0754716981132075
4523001,3,B0051MKNKO,"I bought this DVD at WalMart after work one night since I've always wanted to learn to belly dance. The video, as another viewer says, is a workout video that just uses some dance moves. If you want an instructional bellydance video then you should look somewhere else.

I'm glad they broke down some of the moves used in the video. I've used an instructional video for bellydance that didn't break down the moves and that made it difficult to follow along, so I'm glad the makers of this one kept that in mind. Also, the fact that it's based in dance can make it a more fun workout for some people. However, I think they could have used more bellydance moves, because even though I hadn't actually taken any classes at the time I bought this, I could tell that some of the moves they used aren't found in bellydance. I actually skipped through a couple moves in the breakdown because of this.

This review should be taken with a grain of salt because I only watched the move breakdown all the way, but stopped the workout routine halfway through. I'm giving this a 3/5 because I almost got rid of it. I kept it instead since I figured it would be useful once I started taking bellydance classes.",1343088000,5,1196,4.431818181818182
4523002,4,B0051MKNKO,"In a further effort to get my flabby self into shape, I picked up this DVD because I thought it would be a good change of pace.  I am not the most graceful of dancers but was looking to change things up a bit.  This is more of a cardio working DVD than anything related to belly dancing, but it looks like it is from the music and the attire.  The instructor is cheerful rather than a harsh ""DO IT"" drill sergeant like Jillian Michaels or Bob Harper.  But be warned, just because it isn't Jillian or Bob is it any easier.  You will have to work your way up to doing all three dances if you are not in shape before (which I am not), but once you get it you will take off inches.  Just keep working at it, and you will be alright.  I would, however, recommend supplimenting it with something else (yoga, pilates, weights, etc.) in order to get that real body shaping, because cardio will just take off inches not give you that sculpted look.  This does work the belly a bit more than the average running on the tredmill or aerobics class, but I wonder how this will shape things in the long run.",1335830400,7,1093,4.171428571428572

8452824,1,B0051MKNKO,"This is not belly dance- at all.  References mixing belly dance and bollywood is way off base.  Belly dance is not indigenous to India.  India is in South Asia not the Middle East/North Africa/Turkey where belly dance is from.  London is closer to Cairo than Mumbai is.  If you want to learn real belly dance get an instructor who is qualified.  Same thing if you want to learn dances from India.  If you want to do aerobics that have nothing to do with belly dance, or Indian dances, with vague references to exotic cultures of apparently homogeneous brown people, you  will probably enjoy this travesty.  Culturally appalling and irresponsible way to make a fast buck.",1470268800,,670,4.756521739130434

8452828,3,B0051MKNKO,If you have taken any professional belly dance classes this may mess you up.  It would be better if she slowed down the moves to teach you.  I think once learned though it will be a good workout.  It is more of an aerobics/belly dance.  In my opinion if you love to belly dance  Flex Appeal a belly dance workout by Kathy Smith is much more authentic to the dance.  If you like aerobics and don't know the dance this one is good.,1457049600,,429,4.108433734939759

8452830,3,B0051MKNKO,This is very good workout video and definitely had my heart rate up. I was looking for a little more belly dance and this should really be called bollywood edition rather than belly dance. Unfortunately it was so fast pace that it didn't really give me time to get into the moves because I was too busy trying to keep up.,1440806400,,321,4.278688524590164
