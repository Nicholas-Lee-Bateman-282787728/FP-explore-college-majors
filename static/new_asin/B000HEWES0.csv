This show stands alone along side of satires such as The Onion News Network, Reno 911, Tropic Thunder etc. for reminding the viewers of the absurdities that we face in this society. *Oh and we salute Victor Wilson and Christopher Darga by ignoring a certain penultimate season of the series when it became obvious in the show's dialogue that a major corporate sell-out deal was imminent!!!",1419292800,,524,4.943181818181818

The past few years we've talked about some of the shows we use to watch and how it would be great to see them again.  TV kind of sucks anymore!!!  I'm so sick of some of these freak'in reality shows, they're all the same.  But, I was looking for some of our old shows on DVDs for my husband for Christmas but some aren't available.

One of the biggest kicks I got out of this DVD was the original episode of Takeshi's Castle. That show seems really out there. And I like that.

If you've seen the show, buy the DVD so you can laugh whenever you want. If you haven't seen the show, buy the DVD and see what you're missing. It's fantastic!",1387584000,,459,4.1

I used to record all the episodes on my DVR but after an unfortunate incident (stupid cable company) they were all erased. So I went ahead and bought this season 1. It was well worth it too. I loved the Top 25 Most Painful Elimanations of the Season, I still watch them every few weeks for a good laugh. Now I have to buy the other seasons...",1210204800,,400,4.207792207792208
2637311,5,B000HEWES0,"Absolutly one of the most hilarious shows ever, much of it based on double entendre toilet jokes (""Extreme Elimination"", ""Log Drop"", ""Sinkers and Floaters"" etc) but it ingeniously pokes fun at many contemporary subjects. It is seldom seen on Spike anymore so I purchased all of the DVDs. Creative and superbly written and edited, the whacky visuals and clever dialoge are so fast paced and funny that it is easy to miss much of the wit! Replay value is very high. A great deal of the dubbed humor fits so well into these bizarre games that I can almost imagine that Takeshi's Castle was created for the MXC writers! Like Woody Allens ""Whats Up Tiger Lilly"", MXC has nothing to do with the Japanese original. The DVDs are a bargain at any price!",1201046400,3,744,4.601503759398496
2637312,5,B000HEWES0,"This is a hilarious program that belongs in the ""what were they thinking"" category. These people took this rediculous game show and dubbed it with funny voice overs. They pick teams like ""the accountants"" vs. ""the tax brokers"" to velcro up and splat themselves against a felt spiderweb wall or try to make it accross a series of moveable treetrunklike cyllandars. Personally, I'm surprised nobody has killed themselves trying. This gameshow is like a funny car wreck that you can't stop watching. Why people ofered to go on this show is beyond me.",1195948800,,547,4.89247311827957
2637313,5,B000HEWES0,I never get sick of watching this show.  Glad to have it on DVD!,1189641600,,64,3.5714285714285716
2637314,5,B000HEWES0,"Easily one of the greatest shows on TV, and personally, one of the few shows in existence nowadays worth watching.  What the creators did was take a Japanese game show from the 80s called 'Takeshi's Castle', edit it down and add some dirty and lowbrow 'dubbing' to turn it into one of the greatest and funniest sport shows on TV.  You'll wince in vicarious pain as these people twist, contort, and bruise themselves on rolling logs and sinking rocks, and clench your sides with laughter at such dialog as ""A helmet will keep you from getting knocked out, but not knocked up"" and ""Now back to Guy who's got Bulimia"" after a supermodel named Bulimia Babaganoosh gets eliminated and is forced to be interviewed by a perverse 'French' reporter in a pith helmet named Guy (pronounced ""ghee"") LeDouche.

And a little message to those who feel that MXC is a disgrace to the show Takeshi's Castle, I'd like to point out that ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano (better known as ""Vic Romano"" to MXC fans) fully supports and loves MXC and finds it hilarious.  If Takeshi Kitano can find the humor in MXC, so can you.

In a world forced to live without Mystery Science Theater 3000, we have been given a gift....called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!!",1186963200,2,1230,4.702325581395349

2637317,5,B000HEWES0,"Most Extreme Elimination is brilliant writing disguised as slap-stick comedy...they get a group of people willing to risk making complete fools of themselves while the ""masters of ceremony"" make the funniest comments about their performance.

2637318,5,B000HEWES0,This show is abslutely hilarious.  If you haven't seen it you are truely missing out.  Sometimes the commentary is a little lame but the action and extreme eliminations of the day more than make up for it.  Add in a couple beers and a couple friends and max out the comedy of this one!,1178409600,,285,4.2407407407407405
2637319,5,B000HEWES0,"I bought this set as a gift to someone who had NEVER even heard about 'MXC'. I knew he'd love it, so I bought the season... and I was right, he loved it. Imagine this-- a crazy-insane Japanese game show where contestants must accomplish ridiculous phyiscal tasks and challenges... Now, dub it over in English. Only! The things they say can't be what the people are *really* saying. For example-- before someone goes out to compete, he might throw his hands up into the air and say, ""I LOVE ANAL!""... haha. It's very random and very silly. If you like that sort of non-sensical, slightly inappropriate humour, you'll love this show.",1177286400,,631,4.693693693693693

2637324,5,B000HEWES0,Bought this for a Christmas gift for my husband. This was the first Christmas we spent laughting at a show instead of at stupid relatives. Well worth the money. Can't wait for Season 2 to come out.,1173484800,,197,4.351351351351352
2637325,5,B000HEWES0,"I have been waiting for quite some time for this DVD to arrive.  I purchased it the day it went on sale.

This TV show is hilarious.

This first time I came across this TV show was while browsing thru the channels on cable TV.  Thought it looked stupid and moved on.  At some later date I was scanning the channels once again and couldn't find anything to watch so I gave the show a chance just to see what the heck it was about.  While watching the show, I wasn't quite paying attention 100% and still thought it kinda lame and turned the channel once again.

It wasn't until a friend of mine told me how funny this show was and that I needed to really listen to what the announcers were saying.  So, I gave the show another chance.

It didn't take long until I realized how great a job the writers of this show had done.  This is a hilarious show!

I already know that I will be purchasing additional seasons of the show once they become available.",1172448000,,950,4.193370165745856
2637326,5,B000HEWES0,"I don't really watch movies nor collect them on DVD. But I love this show! But there's some confusion over what's on this 2-Disc set. So here we go.

1. All 13 episodes from season one. 3 of which have optional audio commentary.

2. An episode of ""Takeshi's Castle"" from which MXC is culled from.

3. A nearly 10-minute sales presentation (from Nov. 2001) in attempt to sale the show to interested broadcasters.

4. Kenny Blankenship's Most Painful Elimations of the Season (which IS underproduced & doen't have Blankenship commenting like the norman Painful Elimations of the Day).

There's not much I can see about this set that haven't been said from previous reviews, but get this set if you like the TV series. Also start saving your pennies for season two's coming out soon.",1172188800,4,780,4.7481481481481485
2637327,5,B000HEWES0,"MXC aka Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is one of the only original shows On Spike TV that is worth ANYTHING.  Most of their shows have died and been buried but MXC keeps on going.  What they did was take an old Japanese game show and turned it into a NEW show, cutting it up, pasting it back together with new names, voce overs and tons of humor.  Humor on MANY levels from the gross toilet humor to the intelligent humor that only one out of ten people will get.

The kinky field reporter Guy LeDouche, the witty Captian Tenneal and the always funny hosts Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship keep the show going as we watch people get smashed, dashed and bashed in every dangerous game you could ever think of.  Fans of wild game shows, Japanese culture or MST3K will love this show.

What I would suggest is watch it on Spike TV first and, if you like it, get the first season.

The two discs also include three commentaries, one original episode of Attack Takeshi's Castle, the MXC Sales Presentation and Kenny Blankenship's Most Painful Elimination of the Season.",1171670400,2,1068,4.560209424083769
2637328,5,B000HEWES0,This DVD was everything I had hoped for--hours of MXC without commercials.  It's even funnier than I remembered. It was also interesting to be able to watch the original Japanese version. It's definitely not as funny though.,1171238400,,224,5.054054054054054
2637329,5,B000HEWES0,"Along with Batman and the politically incorrect but hilarious Amos and Andy, MXC is one of the three funniest shows ever on TV. And,with Amos and Andy, it is now on DVD. Kenny, Vic and Guy can now join Andy, Kingfish and Mama in your own living room. Laugh yourself silly, forget today's news and visit the never-never land of these wonderful people who, unfortunately, just exist in our imaginations.",1169596800,3,401,4.742857142857143
2637330,5,B000HEWES0,"It's quite unlikely that you're viewing this page if you haven't seen MXC before, but on the off-chance the show is new to you, let me break it down. There's a TV show in Japan called Takeshi's Castle, and it embodies most of the stereotypes we Americans have about ""crazy Jappanese game shows."" It would appear funny to us on its own. But for added crazy points, they dub in American commentators who turn each competition into a hilarious combination of intelligent, informed cultural satire, and childish jokes about things like sex and poo -- all while watching goofily-dressed Japanese people participate in painful, but slapstick competitions.

It is here, in this delicate balance of high-brow wit and low-brow bawdiness, that we find what makes MXC so brilliant.

While the first season of the show may not be up to par with later episodes, there are still loads of laughs to be had. There are also some pretty strange games featured here that don't seem to appear in any of the more recent episodes. As for bonus features, it's also a little fun to see an original episode of Takeshi's Castle.

All in all, this is a great DVD set to own. It can entertain you. It can entertain roommates. It can entertain guests. It's practically a party available in DVD packaging.",1169424000,3,1275,4.7342342342342345

If you like MXC, you'll love this set. I found if you wait 6 months or more between viewings, you can watch these episodes again and again. It's also more fun watching with people who have never seen it.

If you're new to MXC, check it out on Spike TV, and then come buy this volume. If you're completely out of the loop, I'll break it down. (how did you get to this page?) The producers get old episodes of a wacky Japanese gameshow made in the 80s. They trim it down and dub over the voices with english (and deliciously cheesy double entendres). It's very funny stuff.

The Bonus features are great. I loved listening to the commentaries and the original sales pitch. There's also an un-edited version of Takeshi's Castle (the original Japanese show).

On the other hand, if you're in to this type of commentary and you've seen the show before then I'm sure it will live up to your expectations.

2637345,5,B000HEWES0,"Sometimes the funniest shows are also the simplest in execution.  And no show has ""executed"" so many jokes in such a short span as ""MXC"".

Take a popular game show in Japan from the 80's, sharpen up the editing, change the format of the show, cut out all the audio and replace it with hilarious commentary and you've got what must've been a real surprise to the then-new Spike TV. Once the rest of the line-up like ""Gary the Rat"" and ""Stripperella"" bombed, this show became a nightly staple.

The DVD is from the first season consisting of 13 episodes. Including the memorable ""college girls"" edition and the episode in which a guy nearly breaks his neck doing a bad backflip.

What holds the show together is the rapid fire commentary of ""Vic Romano"" and ""Kenny Blankenship"" who's chemestry is apparent right from the beginning. The voice-over guys portraying them are obviously having a ball along with the one playing ""Guy Le Douche"" and ""Captain Tenneal"".  Mary Sheer is lucky enough to play ""Everygirl"" aka all the voices of the girls on the show.

This is one funny show and certainly deserving of a DVD presentation.  The only quibble I have is with the somewhat high price, but it's only minor.

Extras:
- A complete episode of ""Takashi's Castle"" is included.  What's immediately apparent is how slow-paced the program is.

- Kenny's 25 ""Most Painful Eliminations of the Season"" is surprisingly underproduced. There are no titles or even Kenny providing commentary.

- There is commentary on a few episodes. They contain some enlightening information on just how quickly the the first season had to be produced.

- A ten minute version used to sell the show to Spike. Not surprisingly, it closely resembles what we see the show had become.  Minus a few snappy titles of course.

If you're a fan of the show, then buy all means get this DVD.  For those who haven't seen it, I'd suggest catching a few reruns on Spike (though now it's only on late at night) before spending bucks required to get it.",1165190400,,2005,4.688571428571429
2637346,5,B000HEWES0,"Oh my god, they finally released this show on DVD!  Now I know what I want for Christmas!

If you haven't seen this show yet, I envy you.  You, dear reader, have yet to witness the brilliance of watching armies of un-athletic Japanese contestants mangle, bruise, and humiliate themselves in a devious series of bone-crunching physical stunts.  You have yet to experience the inspired commentary provided by your hosts, Kenny Blankenship and Vic Romano.  You have yet to be profoundly disturbed by the bizarre reportage of sexually deviant reporter-in-the-field Guy LeDouche, and other inexplicable side characaters like Captain Teneille and the Steaming Pile.  If, like me, you have a taste for bizarre comedy, your first viewing of MXC will have you intermittantly clutching your sides with laughter, and wondering ""where the hell did they come up with this material???""

For those of us already devoted to the show, we know that it stands up well to repeated viewings.  Every episode is so packed with hilarious one-liners and double-entendres that they demand multiple viewings, and the carnage of stunts like Log Drop and Sinkers & Floaters never lose their appeal.  To own this show on DVD is a godsend.

2637347,5,B000HEWES0,"I still remember the first time I saw this show.  I wasn't sure what the heck was going on at first until I realized it was some sort of satire using the old video footage as a backdrop.  From then on I was completely hooked.  I do agree with another reviewer though who said that the shows get a little old after you've seen them 3-4 times, since you know what's coming and you've already heard the joke that goes with it.  I'm still buying the DVD though so I can pull it out every so often once I've had enough time to forget what's coming next, so it will be funny once again.  Hopefully the rest of the shows will come to DVD soon.  I know they will have at least one buyer.

Meanwhile, how about some NEW episodes?",1162598400,13,720,4.1
2637348,5,B000HEWES0,"I got hooked on MXC a few years ago when I accidentally discovered it

while channel surfing.  Normally I avoid Spike TV like the plague, but I make an exception for MXC.  This show is the best!  I don't exactly know what's so hilarious about watching people pummel themselves into walls and get pelted with volleyballs shot out of a cannon, but it sure is entertaining. The commentary is really where it's at, though.  There are so many sexual jokes and double entandre's made during the show that you almost have to watch each episode a few times to catch them all.  For those of you not familiar with MXC, it's a take off of a Japanese game  show called Takeshi's Castle, where contestants compete in outrageous and sometimes dangerous games, and face elimination until only a few remain for the final battle. What's really cool about the box set is that there is a whole episode of Takeshi's Castle included, with English subtitles.  I had never seen the actual show before, and now that I've seen one, I'd like to see the rest of them.  The real episode is almost as entertaining as MXC.  Like a previous reviewer said, there is a lot of show cut from the original, which lasts over an hour.  They should have made the MXC episodes last at least an hour.  By the time you factor in commercials, you get about 20 minutes of actual show.  It's still really funny, but when you see just how much more material each episode could offer, it could be a lot better of a show.  My favorite skit on the whole DVD is probably Elimination Idol, starring Simon Bowel and a few contestants who sing some quite hilarious songs.  Like I said, having the DVD is great because you really do miss a lot of the jokes and puns if you only watch the episodes once.  Hopefully season two will have a couple episodes of Takeshi's Castle, I'd really like to see some more of that show.",1161648000,,1866,4.444117647058824
2637349,5,B000HEWES0,"""Most Extreme Elimination Challenge"" is easily one of the funniest shows to hit the tube in a long time.

The sometimes painful footage of Japanese contestants dashing through such absurd obstacle courses (like ""the rotating surfboard of death"") is funny enough, but the lightning commentary by ""Vic Ramone"" and ""Kenny Blankenship"" can be just as hilarious.

Like ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" and HBO's ""Da Ali G Show,"" this series is one of the funniest shows on TV today.

""Right you are, Ken!""",1161216000,2,498,5.048780487804878
2637350,5,B000HEWES0,"Finally this great show comes out onto DVD. With the DVD you get the great games like LOG ROLLARS, BOLDER DASH, SURF BOARDS OF DEATH and my favorite SINKERS AND FLOTERS. With this you get 13 wonderful episodes full of knee crushing, neck breaking, and stomach smashing fun, all with the funny hosts Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship.

First of all I just want to clear the air with all the people arguing that the show was cut from 1 hour down to 20 minutes. These people don't understand that MXC is not the same as TAKESHI'S CASTLE. The creators of MXC is ""taking"" footage from TAKESHI'S CASTLE and putting a little twist to it. Some times they will take multipliable episodes from TAKESHI'S CASTLE and put them together to make 1 MXC episodes. In TAKESHI'S CASTLE the players are playing for themselves (and money) for MXC they have team (mostly two teams).  TAKESHI'S CASTLE is not even translated for MXC, everything is made up.

The thing I really liked about this DVD is that you get an original episode of TAKESHI'S CASTLE. Plus 3 commentaries on selected episodes and 25 of seasons 1 top PAINFULL ELIMINATION.

This is a great show I have yet found a person that didn't like it. This is definitely a must get for fan or if you only seen one episode, just can't go wrong with this 2 Disc set.

But once I found out that the shows were originally an hour long and shown that way in Europe I was sad that the US ""re-creators"" of Takeshi's Castle didn't go the whole hog and make it an hour too.  Yes I do understand that the best content was edited down to make what we know of as MXC today but man 50 minutes of Kenny and Vic would have been fab.  Hats off to a great show,  leaves the UK / US variants in the dust.  Just wish all good things didn't have to come to an end in Japan.  Poor Gee really did end up in the klanger.  On a side note I find new US attempts at recreating this show very hokey and well not near as entertaining as even the Japanese original let alone the LA MXC remakes.",1160870400,3,718,3.910344827586207

Takeshi's Castle itself is an amazing show. So good I would watch MXC on TV with the volume muted. Give us the original Takeshi's Castle with english subtitles (if only to find out if the Japanese have as low a taste in humor as the producers of MXC).",1160611200,2,409,4.666666666666667
2637353,5,B000HEWES0,"MXC contains, quite simply, some of the most side-splitting, piss-my-pants-laughing things that I have ever seen.

Despite an earlier reviewer who complained that ELIMINATION IDOL was his least favorite event, one of the most gut-bustingly funny segments EVER featured Josh Jarhead and a couple other ""contestants"" that had me and a friend literally crying and gasping for air. It was THAT funny. And it was the writing, not the stunts, that did it.

Then there is the non-stop frathouse humor that is not only crude, but erudite. Imagine that: Highbrow filth!!

This is, without a doubt, the funniest show on television.  The crazy stunts combined with the witty locker room humor combine to make MXC funnier than any show I've ever seen, and that's not an exaggeration.  If you haven't seen an episode of MXC yet, do yourself a favor.  Buy this DVD and prepare to laugh yourself right off the couch.  Spike TV, bring on season two!!!",1160438400,,539,4.448979591836735
2637355,5,B000HEWES0,"About 3 years ago, a relative attempted to describe to me a hilarious show that he had seen the night before on The New TNN (now Spike TV). His description went something like, ""So there are ALL these Japanese guys doing crazy stunts and hurting themselves for 30 minutes straight. They fall off logs, get crushed by boulders, and slam into walls, and it's all hilariously dubbed into English!"" Needless to say, I was sold, and made it a point to watch this ""crazy"" show ASAP.

Fast forward to 2006, and MXC (Most Extreme Elimination Challenge) is as funny as ever. Obviously, the main appeal of the show is in the outrageous stunts that are performed by the contestants. The incredibly mean-spirited events provide for plenty of physical humor, and the clueless innocence of the contestants just makes it that much funnier.

There's more to MXC than simply physical comedy. The over-the-top production is genuinely funny even without any English dubbing, with plenty of elaborate sets and costumes in every episode. Don't discount the dubbing, though. The writing is filled with hilarious double entendres and bizarre references that will make even the most jaded viewer crack a smile.

MXC will appeal to viewers of most ages (many of the crude jokes will doubtless go over young childrens' heads, but I'd still recommend it to children over the age of 10), so the DVD will make a perfect present for anyone looking for a fix of quirky humor. The extras (including a full episode of the Japanese show) are excellent, as is the value. Enjoy, and spread the word!",1160006400,12,1563,4.824626865671642

Now we can watch Vic, Kenny, Guy Le Douche, Captain Tenneal, Chief Auto Parts, and Skanky whenever we want to!  This is Season One of MXC and here is the episode list:

Episode 1) Meat Handlers vs. Cartoon Voice Actors

Games: Sinkers and Floaters, Log Drop, Wall Buggers, and Boulder Dash

Review: This is one of the best episodes in season one not only because of four great games, but also by the guy who can be seen below the ""X"" on the DVD cover.

Episode 2) Donors vs. Addicts

Games: Mud Butlers, Dash To Death, Rotating Surfboard of Death, Brass Balls, and Pole Riders

Review: This is the first episode with Dash to Death and Surfboard of Death.  Dash to Death has always been one of favorite games.  Though there still good games, Pole Riders and Mud Butlers aren't my favorites.

Episode 3) Cows vs. Cars

Games: Wall Bangers, Get Hard, Saddle Sores, Swish Bucklers, and Teetering Temple of Crippling Doom

Review: Wall Bangers is good, other than that, it's not the best episode.

Episode 4) Cops vs. Cons

Games: Dope on a Rope, Slippery Slope of Slanted Death, Hand Job, Bunk Buddies, Door Jam, and Yankin' It

Review: At the bottom of season one.  There's no Log Drop, Sinkers and Floaters, or Dash to Death.

Episode 5) The Couples Show

Games: Plank Spankers, Surfboard of Death, Irritable Bowl Syndrome, Wall Buggers, and Brass Balls

Review: One of the few episodes with Plank Spankers, and the first episode with Bowl Syndrome.  All in all, it's a good episode.

Episode 6) Inventors vs. Former Childhood Stars

Games: Slippery Slope of Slanted Death, Sinkers and Floaters, Door Jam, Le Tour de Grand Prix (Pronounced by Kenny: Prix), and Log Drop

Review: A great episode with Log Drop, Sinkers and Floaters, and Le Tour de Grand Prix.

Episode 7) College Girls

Games: Slippery Slope of Slanted Death, Boulder Dash, Dead-End Zone, Sinkers and Floaters, Ball Bangers, and Log Drop

Review: Three good games, Boulder Dash (one of my favorites), Sinker and Floaters, and Log Drop.

Episode 8) Outdoorsmen vs. Educators

Games: Great Holes of Glory, Boulder Dash, Wall of Maim, Sinkers and Floaters, Pole Riders, and Log Drop

Review: Same as Episode 7, with the addition of Great Holes of Glory.

Episode 9) Circus Workers vs. Travel Industry

Games: Slippery Slope of Slanted Death, Bird Dropping, Foul Balls, Little Man in the Boat, Corn Holders, and Dirty Balls

Review: Lame episode.

Episode 10) Physical Fitness Industry vs. The Music Industry

Games: Turtle Gut Check, Shaft Grabbers, Clear Sphere of Fear, and Jerk and Release

Review: Clear Sphere of Fear is one of the funniest games in the world.  People climbing inside a clear sphere and getting rolled down a hill with obstacles.

Episode 11) Fashion vs. Religion

Games: Yank My Dinghy, Buck Off, Eat Shiitake, and Runaway Stump

Review: Eat Shiitake and Runaway Stump are both very good.

Episode 12) Adult Entertainment vs. Home Improvement

Games: Athlete's Feet, Dope on a Rope, Elimination Idol, Dash to Death, and Surfboard of Death

Review: All the games are good except Elimination Idol, a game I've always disliked.

Episode 13) Medical Profession vs. Gambling Industry

Games: Sack Lunch, Boulder Dash, Dead-End Zone, Brass Balls, and Bunk Buddies

Review: Boulder Dash and Brass Balls are excellent as always.

Take a forgein TV show, completely redub the lines into something hilarious and make the shows format and change it enough so that it is wacky.  Maybe thats not a great way of describing the show but it'l have to do.  MXC has some of the most clever dialouge you will hear (short of ""right you are Ken"") coupled with what in Japan I can only assume is a serious sportsminded show.  The contestants in the show take some nasty bumps that would make professional wrestlers wince and IT'S HILARIOUS.  You'll have to watch each episode twice, one to catch the injuries and another to hear the commentary of the hosts.  When you have characters described as working for ""Happy Jihad one way truck rentals"" or remarking that illeagal cock fighting and bathroom swordplay are not one in the same, it's even funnier.

I hope theres an option for cycling through episodes or a ""play all"" I can't catch this show on Spike anymore and still love it.  Mixing up the episodes will make it fresh since for a while when I was taping them it was starting to lose it's appeal since I would know what was coming next.
