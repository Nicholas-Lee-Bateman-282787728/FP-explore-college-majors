6078364,5,B00GJ6KA9K,"Written on Skin is the work of British composer George Benjamin with text by Martin Crimp. It takes place in medieval Italy and tells a story of three people: the Protector, his wife Agnes and the Boy and their complicated love triangle. The story is told though a framework of XXI C. angels, one of whom becomes the Boy and experiences the forces of sexual attraction and violence.

The story focuses on the Boy who is commissioned by the Protector to create a book. The Protectors wife Agnes finds herself attracted to the Boy and it is through that attraction that she is able to liberate herself from her abusive husband who treats her like his property. This Opera is violent and full of passion. Characters sing about themselves in a 3rd person form, which can be a little confusing at the beginning, but with a little adjusting ceases to be a problem.

The set design is very impressive as it is divided into two parts  a minimalist modern scene and another that represents medieval Italy. Most of the action takes place in the medieval part and characters there are expressive the full of passion. This clashes with the modern part that is calm and clean and has some sort of clinical feel to it. It is a shame that there are so few shots featuring the whole of the stage, as the contrast is a little lost in the DVD version.

The lightening in the production is remarkable and watching the DVD feels more like watching a film rather than a recording of the onstage piece. Another benefit to watching Written On Skin at home is that you can look at the singers great performance up close including their movements and facial expression  something I was not able to do in the theatre.

The DVD includes a leaflet with a synopsis of the Opera as well as an introduction to Benjamins work. (Available in French and German) The DVD has English, French, German and Japanese subtitles making it accessible to the international audience. The extra features include cast gallery, interview with George Benjamin and an introduction to Written on Skin.

I think this work can be challenging for those who are not too familiar with Opera. I certainly would not recommend this performance to someone new to the world of Opera. However the DVDs extras offer a great inside to the work of Benjamin. Although the storyline was a little confusing at first I have gained a much better understanding of the work being able to see it twice.",1405900800,3,2429,4.634883720930232

6078366,4,B00GJ6KA9K,"As someone still feeling their way around opera, I found Written on Skin a challenge, but the sensitive and innovative filming of the production provides some powerful and lasting imagery.

The curtain rises on an interesting set, divided into a number of blocks, the two on the left being modern, minimalist and functional - perhaps representing the back offices and changing room of the Royal Opera House or a laboratory - whilst the blocks on the right represent the 13th century home and gardens of the central characters, the Protector and his wife Agns. It took me a while to understand what was going on and how the two different sets of blocks were integrated. Whilst the singing was, of course, impeccable, it was not until several minutes in that I realised the opera was in fact sung in English. Had it not been for the useful synopsis provided with the DVD, I would certainly have struggled to make head or tail of the production. The plot is complex and ambitious, with many details difficult to portray through opera. A story within a story, the opera depicts the tragic tale of an apprentice entering the home of the Protector and Agns, eventually establishing a relationship with the latter. The story is manipulated by the modern day Chorus of Angels, who form the additional characters, change the scenery and costumes, and even turn the lights on and off. All very confusing, but a very interesting concept once you get your head around it.

This is certainly not to discredit the work of the singers themselves. Whilst diction could be at times a little clearer, their singing and acting were excellent, providing depth to the characters from the very outset  Barbara Hannigans concerned and tortured Agns was particularly powerful. The use of a mixture of camera angles enables their true acting talent to be seen, with the close ups showing the subtleties of their acting and discrediting the usual perception of opera being over the top. Indeed, it is the filming that really makes this production, giving movement to an otherwise static set and enabling the audience to appreciate the subtle details present. The camera angles are innovative, including offering a birds eye view, shifting within the set itself, and looking up the stairs towards Heaven in the closing scene. As a result, this DVD feels as if it is actually a film specially produced for the camera, rather than a performance on stage at the Royal Opera House, allowing the viewer to truly get lost in the action. Whilst not to everyones taste, this is a must see for any modern opera lover, as well as students of film, stage production and set design.",1403568000,7,2643,4.830022075055187

But, when I order to understand what I am watching and listening to, I need to pore over obtuse technical explanations,  the music is frankly unimpressive to my ""untrained"" ears, the mise-en-scene has no visual attractiveness, I say: don't go there. Only for academics, opera reviewers and the British, who, by the way, should listen to more Britten and less of this pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook.

6078369,5,B00GJ6KA9K,"It's hard to judge and define what makes a work of modern opera great when you don't have history and the legacy of the composer to look back on. In the age of DVD and Blu-ray you can judge for yourself now whether a work has merit by how much it draws you back to view it again. On that basis, standing up to repeated viewings that reveal new elements, George Benjamin's Written on Skin is undoubtedly one of the best new opera works of recent years, a work that creates a compelling musical and narrative language of its own that creates a world that resembles little else out there.

The question of events retaining or gaining significance with time is, not by chance, a large part of what Written on Skin is all about. Based on a 13th century work by the troubadour Guillem de Cabestaing (Le Coeur mang), Written on Skin intentionally and very specifically filters a very old story through new eyes and with a modern sensibility. The medieval story involves a wealthy landowner, the Protector, who wishes to have his achievements and his pre-eminent place in the world to be immortalised by hiring an artisan to create an illuminated manuscript. His wife however wishes also to have her place in this world redefined and encourages the Boy to make the woman real. Starting to think for herself and act of her own accord undermines the Protector's position, so that when he discovers that his wife has cheated on him, he kills the Boy and serves his heart up to her to eat.

Crimp and Benjamin however use a framing device of 21st century angels in an adjoining ""workshop"" recreating and taking part in the drama. It's a very post-modern device in how it alerts us to the fact that the drama is an artificial construct. The intention however is not to distance the viewer from the original story, but to actually show that despite the passing of time, despite the artifice of staged drama, that great art - and specifically opera - can be transforming, but also violent and even dangerous. The opera itself is an Illuminated Book that immortalises events and puts them into a format that can allow us to viscerally experience the past. If at times Written on Skin does then feel like a calculated intellectual exercise, it's not a cold one, but one rather that is bursting with ideas, passions and meaning.

Much of that is down to the concision of the dramatic setting and the precision of the words used in Martin Crimp's text, but it's brought to life by the equally precise and considered musical score by George Benjamin. It does exactly what the music ought to do, flowing behind the words and ""illuminating the page"", accompanying the emotions, pushing them, but also filling in-between the layers. The writing also gives due regard for the words and the voices to sing them. It's not about singing beautiful phrases, but finding a voice that dramatically expresses the text and character. You can't ask for better singers in that regard or more fully committed and indeed technically accomplished performances than those given here at Covent Garden (as at the original world premiere in Aix-en-Provence), by Christopher Purves as the Protector, Barbara Hannigan as Agns and countertenor Bejun Mehta as the Boy.

Katie Mitchell's direction makes note of the artifice in Vicki Mortimer's boxed design with angel workshops surrounding the scenes where the drama is played out, but fully recognises the human passions that are played out within it. As with the world premiere in Aix, the composer George Benjamin conducts his own score. That score is given a beautiful sound stage in the audio tracks on the Blu-ray release. The image quality is clear and, with a wider than usual 2.35:1 image (with thin black bars at the top and bottom of the screen), it looks quite cinematic. Overhead cameras with wide angles are occasionally used to present a different perspective on the drama. The extra features on the BD are brief but informative, with a 5-minute Introduction, a 2-minute interview with Benjamin and a Cast Gallery. Subtitles are in English, French, German and Japanese only.",1389744000,19,4093,4.809659090909091
8623723,4,B00GJ6KA9K,"""Written on Skin"", premiered in 2012, was composer George Benjamin's second opera after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Little-Hill/dp/B001DFITRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Little Hill</a>. Benjamin again asked playwright Martin Crimp to write the libretto, and it continues their first opera's striking style of mixing very modern themes with a tale that seems old as the ages. This video release on DVD and Bluray captures the staging at the Royal Opera House in March 2013. The composer himself conducts, and the three main roles are played by the same singers as the premiere.

The plot is relatively simple: somewhere in France and sometime in the Middle Ages, a landowning husband (""The Protector"", bass-baritone, Christopher Purves) lords it over his serfs and his young wife (""The Woman"", soprano, Barbara Hannigan). The Protector hires a young artist (""The Boy"", countertenor, Bejun Mehta) to create what must have been the ultimate status symbol in this medieval society: an illuminated manuscript on vellum (something literally written on skin). The Woman, feeling neglected by her husband, seduces The Boy as he creates the manuscript. The Protector catches wind of this and kills The Boy, then serves his heart to The Woman. (This drama is vaguely inspired by the mythical life of Guillaume de Cabestany, a troubadour not a manuscript illuminator.) A chorus of angels provides commentary, and the sister and husband-in-law of The Woman are the only prominent supporting characters.

The staging creates an entire other layer around this. The medieval drama plays out in one of the several rooms visible on stage. The other rooms that connect to it are set up like a modern archive, staffed by people who seem to be preserving the sort of medieval manuscripts that The Boy would have created. The employees of this archive enter the medieval chateau room to become the chorus of angels, before withdrawing to the modern setting. Granted with a perspective that transcends any one time, the angels refer to modern things like the Holocaust or the concreted lanes that will eventually cover up our medieval France setting in the same breath as the medieval barbarism on display in the opera's plot. The three main characters also sometimes speak of themselves in the third person, which makes them even more archetypes of something universal than their generic names already suggest.

George Benjamin's music continues to explore the same vaguely French impressionist vein as earlier works, with a love of low winds and strings. The music works more through atmosphere than distinct melody or leitmotifs. Audiences are unlikely to walk away humming anything from the opera, and if you don't already enjoy, for example, Berg's operas, then this will probably prove too modern for you. However, I think the music is a good accompaniment for the action onstage, as well as the characters' inner thoughts. Some of the sonorities in Benjamin's orchestration are striking, such as the mixture of a bass viol and brass in one scene (almost sounding like a big artificial sitar), and the glass harmonica played as the opera draws to a close.

I don't think this music makes enough of an impression to enjoy as a purely auditory experience, a reason that I gave a low rating to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CD-release/dp/B009VECK8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CD release</a>&nbsp;of this opera. However, when music are combined with visuals, this is a rather engaging and suspenseful experience. Part of that is the atmosphere of scandal: I don't think Ive ever seen an opera with so much unrestrained eroticism: grinding, crotch-rubbing, not to mention a brief gay sex scene that's played out. It makes most stagings of Berg's ""Lulu"" look tame. But salaciousness aside, the characters get a chance to truly act, not just sing. Hannigan, sexually frustrated for so long but now exploding in all that repressed desire, is a fearsomely physical presence on stage. No wonder she seems totally knackered when she comes out at the end for applause! The only downside of the visuals is Bejun Mehta: his grotesque facial mannerisms really kill the magic: bulging eyes, pronounced swallowing. It makes this poignant victim part into a buffo one, and I don't think it was intentional. Rather, Mehta's acting or mere natural appearance is totally out of sync with the rest of the cast, and there is zero chemistry between him and Hannigan.

Anyone interested in modern classic music ought to try WRITTEN ON SKIN, and while I wish that Benjamin's score had been stronger as pure music, I can understand the buzz that this opera has generated.",1494633600,3,4742,5.351206434316354
8623724,5,B00GJ6KA9K,"This Opera, composed by George Benjamin is one of a kind, incredibly well written and performed by singers who inhabit their rolls completely. Benjamin took years to write this opera and the time has served him well. So many contemporary operas seem to be so filled with sound that there is no time for silence. Benjamin has a healthy respect for beautiful melodic lines with plenty of air between voice and instruments yet he can hit hard with a crunch of brass and percussion and create a violence unique and frightening. The libretto jumps back and forth from Medieval times to the 21sst C, without seeming like a gimmick. I love everything about this piece.",1455926400,,661,4.756521739130434

Martin Crimp has translated a simple medieval morality tale into a framework that is created and manipulated by a group of, more or less, renegade angels on the search for something lost. George Benjamin has created a score of many colors that uses the vocalists as instruments as well as vehicles for storytelling. This piece has quickly become very popular in the world of opera, and I believe it is due primarily to the layering created by the combination of story, staging and scoring.

8623730,4,B00GJ6KA9K,"Written on Skin is a modern opera composed by George Benjamin and written by Martin Crimp. It tells the story of three main characters: The Boy, The Protector and his submissive wife Agnes. Set in 13th Century Provence, the wealthy Protector pays the Boy to create an illuminated manuscript to document his deeds. The Boy and the Protectors wife Agnes become attracted to each other, initiating a love triangle between the characters, setting the scene for Agnes uprising and a surprising act of revenge. The Boy is murdered by the Protector, who then forces Agnes to eat The Boys heart, finally, in the operatic climax Agnes commits suicide.
Nearly all of the Opera is sung by the three characters, giving the duration an almost short feeling compared to the typically 2 1/2 hour Operas that I am used to.

The libretto written by Martin Crimp is very straightforward, and easy to understand while still being very dramatic, it is styled in a way which allows the main characters to talk about themselves and narrate their actions in the third person, almost allowing the audience to hear their thoughts whilst creating a subtle distance between the performer and the character. The vivid intensity is maintained throughout the performance

As usual the Orchestra are fantastic, with the orchestral score including conventional instruments, as well as a few unusual ones like the glass harmonica and steel drum.

I particularly liked the very modern staging, which is divided into four sections akin to different periods in time; two sections on the left resembling office rooms, and in the right sided sections, the inside of the Protectors home and an outdoor wood area. There is a stark contrast between the two sides, with the left side having a very simplistic office style, giving it a very modern vibe compared to the period design of the right side.

Another element of the performance that was enjoyable was the use of the secondary Angel characters. The staging and libretto provided that the Angels were not just mere onlookers but were active in the story, they appear throughout the Opera steering the characters in their different directions, whispering rumors and impulses to the characters and setting the scene

The lighting was also very good providing the right atmosphere for the particular scene along with the camera angles sometimes focusing on one particular room to allow the viewer to feel completely immersed in the scene and see the characters facial expression and actions, rather than have to search the stage for the character.

The DVD also includes behind the scene videos, a selection of subtitles including French, Italian and German and a leaflet with a thorough synopsis enabling viewers to get a better understanding of the opera.

Although at the beginning it took me a while to follow the opera, I enjoyed the intensity and staging. It was also a pleasant surprise to find that the Opera was sung entirely in English, allowing me to focus more on the Opera and not have to split my concentration between the subtitles and the performance. Definitely a must see for any modern opera lovers.",1407196800,5,3130,4.9732313575525815
8623731,5,B00GJ6KA9K,"With libretto by playwright  Martin Crimp ( 1956- ), Written on Skin is a new  opera by George Benjamin (1960 - ), a British composer, writer,  conductor, pianist and music teacher,  who has recently become incredibly popular, in part due to the success of  the opera itself.  According to an article written by Eric Dahan for French daily newspaper Libration, June 19 2014 issue, Since the wild success of Written on Skin,  George Benjamin has become the ""Spielberg of Opera"" .Benjamin is now the ""most bankable of opera composers.""
Similar  comments on the opera - by Corinna  da Fonseca-Wollheim, for  the New York Times,  August 13 2013 issue - are:  Within minutes of the premiere of George Benjamins Written on Skin, at the Aix-en-Provence Festival last summer, opera houses around the world jostled for production rights to this darkly erotic opera . In the past year, it has been staged in London, Amsterdam, Toulouse, Munich and Vienna, each time bringing audiences to their feet and leaving critics to pull out superlatives they hadnt thought theyd ever use in the context of new opera.
More comparably positive  reviews on George Benjamin and his latest opera are available  on the internet.
After reading the above and similar responses to the opera and its authors, can anyone  possibly give Written on Skin  anything less than five stars?
So, having concluded that - based on the general opinion - this new composition is a  masterpiece as well as a milestone in the opera world,  let us learn  more  about it.
Written on Skin  is an opera in three parts -  yes, it is parts not acts, as librettist Martin Crimps assures us.  It premiered  at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 2012, and was then shown at  the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden  in London, during  March 2013.  George  Benjamin conducted  both  performances.  The opera had its US premiere in August at the 2013 Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music,  where it was also conducted  by the composer.
The opera in the DVD is the one presented at  the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden during March 2013.  It lasts approximately 90 minutes. It is sang in English, with English, French, German and Japanese subtitles.
Like  many 20th- 21st century operas -  most prominent among them, Debussy's Pellas et Mlisande  and Berg's  Wozzeck  -  Written on Skin is not the traditional collection of arias and recitatifs  of the  18th and  19th century operas.  It has been described  by music reviewer and commentator, Lloyd Schwartz  as  a setting for a play divided into short scenes, with some of the best music coming between the scenes.
The staging  is unusual, and consists of four  tableaus  appearing  simultaneously on the  stage/TV screen  -  a long one above, two below, and a staircase on the right side.  Two of the tableaus show 21st  century environments, the third, a medieval background.  The setting  shifts from one  tableau to another,  the effect being accomplished by highlighting the tableau in question.  The  shifting results in  an interesting overlapping of time, from 13th century to  our own times.
Costumes are both  medieval and 21st  century, probably  more often 21st century, than medieval.
The libretto  is  based on the legend of the troubadour Guillaume de Cabestany, a legend that  was  described  in various literary works of the time, including  The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375).  The place is  Provence.  The time - as we just noted - shifts  from our  modern era  to  the 13th century, when books were rare because individually hand prepared, and precious because written and illuminated on animal skins  (hence the title of the opera).
Three angels - some narrators and characters at the same time  -  open the show by singing  about how our modern civilization, with its parking lots and international airports, has been built on top of the ""heaped-up dead of the past.
The actual story  is not for the faint of  heart.  If you found disturbing the last scene from Wozzeck - where the little boy  hears  about  the recently found body of a  woman on the outskirts of town, and  all alone heads for the site,  without realizing that such a woman is his own mother -  this opera is not for you.  Neither it is, if you found in bad taste the scene from Richard Strauss Salom, where the heroine sings passionate  love words to the severed  bleeding head of St. John the Baptist.  You may not appreciate the same opera,  if you think that  Shostakovichs Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District  has too much explicit sex.
Written on Skin is more graphic and more disconcerting than any of the above, possibly even than all of the above put together.  Particularly so, because it is narrated by angels who - while comment throughout on the action from a modern-day perspective - do recognize the cruelty in human nature, yet realize that such cruelty cannot be controlled.
This is what happens.  A wealthy man, known as The Protector -  and described by the angels as  addicted to purity and violence  - pays  a character known as The Boy  (in reality, one of the angels who assumes  human form for the story)  to create an illuminated  manuscript which will  flatter himself and his family and possibly make them immortal.  The Protector  treats his wife Agns poorly, as he  considers her  just another  of his possessions.  Unhappy,  Agns turns  her attention  to The Boy.  The two  have an  affair which is very short lived because  The Protector  - who apparently is  also in love and having a liaison with  The Boy  (based on the way he kisses him on stage, possibly in real life as well) -  soon  becomes aware of it.  He is wildly jealous: after all, not only has his own wife been unfaithful, so has his young male lover.  He takes revenge on the two of them by murdering  The Boy;  by then pulling  out his heart, cooking it and offering it to his unaware  wife who actually finds the dish  pleasant to the taste, salt and sweet, as she describes it...  .
Such  is the story so far, without any exaggerations, all details being accurately acted out on stage.
Agns is not horrified, after her husband reveals the nature of her dinner,  rather she  seems mildly content, as she believes that she has swallowed  the heart of the man  she loved and that consequently she has made him part of herself.
Like in a Greek tragedy,  Agns  dies in the end -  by suicide, after  jumping out of the balcony, and in order to avoid being killed by her husband.., The Protector.
Her falling body appears suspended on-stage against  the night sky, while three painted angels look towards the spectators.
The opera ends.
If we believe  the unanimously positive reviews by the press both in Europe and the United States, we can only conclude that this is a work after which opera will never be the same.  But then again,  it may be just a question of taste.  Personally, rather than moving with the times, in this particular case, I would  prefer to remain behind and watch more traditional 18th and 19th century works, such as Don Giovanni or the Magic Flute;  LElisir dAmore;  La Traviata or Aida;  La Boheme.  Perhaps, just perhaps,  even 20th century operas such as Peter Grimes and  Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.",1406937600,7,7233,4.740259740259741
8623732,5,B00GJ6KA9K,"Disturbing, dark and violent, but full of passion and completely different from anything I have ever seen. Written on Skin tells the story of the Boy, the Protector and his wife, Agnes.

The protector commissions the boy to create an extravagant illuminated book to honour his wealth and life. This however acts as a catalyst for the rebellion of his much younger wife, Agnes, much to the Protector's anger, which Christopher Purves portrays excellently. The Protector then murders the Boy, forcing Agnes to eat his heart to prove her obedience, to which she says 'not if you strip me to the bone with acid' will ever take the taste of the boys heart out of her mouth. To this the Protector takes a knife with the intention of killing Agnes, but she takes her own life instead by jumping from the balcony.

The DVD is a fantastic option for a newbie opera goer like myself as not only does in have subtitles (in English, French, German and Japanese), but it also includes a detailed synopsis which admittedly without either I would have struggled to follow the production.

The set was incredibly striking, divided into four rooms which represented the past and the present with the story carefully created to combine both elements in what I found to be a very dramatic production. The lighting and camera angles were equally as innovative, some showing a birds eye view of the set whilst others focused simply on one room.

I found both the singing and acting outstanding, the character development was excellent and each role was so different but each well defined. Barbara Hannigan's compelling portrayal of Agnes was particularly remarkable and because of the camera angles you could see every facial expression and small detail which really allowed me to fully appreciate the magnificent acting from a view that I would never have had from my usual Amphi seat.

Even though I found the story difficult to follow at times, I loved the production and how powerful it was. I really think it is a must see for opera fans because of the originality and quality of the production",1406332800,,2078,4.793296089385475
