8605079,1,B00EFEN55E,Seems to expect viewer to provide own screen play.  Three pointless short films randomly edited interrupting each other to make a full length incoherent mess.  Actor's unattractive and talentless.  Not so much released as escaped.  Watching a blank tape would be more amusing.,1408320000,,276,5.348837209302325
8605080,1,B00EFEN55E,If I could give it 0 I would. Terrible acting and production was worse than mu high school performance of Rent.,1405382400,,111,4.333333333333333
8605081,3,B00EFEN55E,"What you find is ""Ordinary"" colored gay guys, you just don't see them often on movies.
The story is sweet but goes so slow that I had to fast forward. Script and screen/sound qualities are pretty amateurish.
Nice depth with several languages.",1394150400,2,242,4.785714285714286
8605082,1,B00EFEN55E,"horribly written, horribly produced, horrible editing, really bad acting, and even bad filming. the worst independent film I have ever seen. the story line was as if it only been half filmed, missing so much. the characters were so beyond fake. whom ever made this film tried to use every artistic maneuver but missed all of them. if all of the characters died in a horrible fire at the end I might have enjoyed the film a little more. I rented this for $1.99 and I want it back and I think I should be compensated for the time I sat through it trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. do not rent or buy. someone should pay the people involved to find something else to do. amazon should allow for negative stars.",1392508800,4,717,4.318518518518519
