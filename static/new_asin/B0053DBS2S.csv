8455174,5,B0053DBS2S,"This series is really neat as clues to the characters life are given in the form of a magic comic book.  Probably this was before Heroes or other series that used the concept.  Great teen series, excellent teen actors and entertaining!!!!  Thanks Mill Creek for another affordable series!!!!",1324684800,,291,5.020833333333333
8455175,3,B0053DBS2S,The first season they just screw around and nothing is done. The second season is better but characterization varies from episode to episode. The story is pretty unique combining comic animation with live action. Special effects are pretty good. Another thing that bothers me is that there are necromancers but they don't do anything related to the field. Still the show is entertaining.,1319414400,,387,5.158730158730159
8455176,5,B0053DBS2S,"Since my son & I love watching shows like Tower Prep and Unnatural History it sounded ideal (and the price was very right) so I thought I'd give it a shot as a present for his 13th birthday.  We both became addicted to it immediately (as did one of his friends who usually think what we like to watch is lame) and will probably be a ""go to"" video when boredom sets in meaning that we'll probably watch it more than once.",1303344000,6,420,4.121951219512195
8455177,5,B0053DBS2S,"My kids used to watch this series when they were younger and were thrilled to receive the DVD for Christmas. Service was great, item was mailed out quickly and was here in plenty of time for the holidays . Thanks!",1293667200,3,213,4.35
