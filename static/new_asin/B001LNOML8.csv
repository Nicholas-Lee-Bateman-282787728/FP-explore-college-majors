8319190,3,B001LNOML8,"Trashy, early to mid 60's, soap opera set in the sports car racing world.  A young up-and-coming racing driver starts an affair with the wife of a rich racer after he is rough-housed by rich man's lackeys on his orders.  Actually Mrs. rich man does the pursuing, buying the stud a racing Ferrari and other sundries.  The rich man knows all about the affair and smirkingly threatens his wife with divorce and leaving her with nothing.  Since he tomcats around himself he should not throw any stones.  The woman and her lover plan to kill off her husband on the track in an arranged racing accident.  In the end all three get their commupance.  The Sinister Cinema DVD-R, which I believe is the only version available, is only OK quality.  The picture is fair but the color is very faded.  Since this is an obscure film I doubt it will be re-mastered any time soon.  Recommended for fans of whatever genre this is.",1438646400,,912,4.539877300613497
8319191,2,B001LNOML8,Some low budget movies are shot in 16mm and transferred to 35mm. This movie looks like it was shot in 8mm. It has actors that nobody heard of then or now. Even the slip case has no mention of who the actors are. If you like late 50's sports car racing this movie has it. Shot at Sebring it does have some good action. Although shot in color the colorization is faded and looks B & W in some scenes. If you purchase this movie don't expect much.,1368144000,2,444,4.056818181818182
