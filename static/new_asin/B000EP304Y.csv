8112462,3,B000EP304Y,"Our family purchased this VHS tape after my six year old daughter became a Josie and the Pussycats fan by watching the regular series on DVD.  While the quality of the video and sound are less than that of the DVD, the stories are pretty much on par.  There are only two episodes on the tape, but until they come out on DVD this is your only option.  My daughter enjoys this tape, but I wish they would clean up the audio and video and release the whole series on DVD.

They have added one character named Bleep, that only Melody seems to understand.  Unfortunately this gives Sebastian a lesser role.  I'm not a huge fan of Bleep, but it gives the series a more of a ""space"" feel.  Another small gripe is that they don't start the show with the introduction song as they do in the DVD version of the regular series (even after 30 some odd years, its still a great song!).",1249689600,2,872,4.248484848484848
8112463,1,B000EP304Y,"this is one i found in a video store that was going out and was selling all it's tapes. i liked the show and my family has enjoyed the other tapes we found of this great little show,so i bought it. josie is about an all girl rock band that always finds adventure as they tour world or as is the case in the second season,where these shows were pulled from,outer space! while the shows were good this tape is the worst as it is very dark and grainy(i asked and got a histiry of it's rental and it was checked out twice so i dought it is because of over use). it is almost unwatchable. skip it!!!!!",1151280000,,596,4.059322033898305
