1923864,1,B0000DC14U,"I was enormously dissatisfied with this DVD and if sending it back from Sydney, Australia wasn't such a nuisance I would have done it, post-haste. It has always amused me how people who understand such simple things as 'cat' and 'door' and 'mat' continue to believe that Kennedy was killed form behind. Duh! But alas, I digress. If you're itching for proof of a conspiracy and an insight into the heart of insidious American politics this compilation will do little to satisfy your curiosity.
The DVD begins with 5 or so releays of the Zapruder film , played at different speed, with all but NO commentary. We have all seen the Zapruder film enough, so I presume that we don't really need this 'silent' replay again and again and again. That's right! Even the sound from the policeman's microphone is missing. So you sit at home in silence going 'oooh' when his head blows apart. It's interesting once, or even twice, but not 5 times. Amazing 'new' technology allows us to repeat film pretty easily without having it take up space on a DVD; simply press 'rewind'. Just one playing of the Zapruder film with 'sound' would have been nice. This DVD doesn't even allow us to make up our own minds about the number of gunshots beacause we can't hear any.
The DVD then moves through 12 other amateur films taken on the day. None of these are as interesting as the Zapruder film and few, if any, show any view of the shooting. You have never seen them before beacuse they contribute absolutely nothing to the debate. Generally there is some distant blurred image in which we can see Mrs. Kennedy rolling about on the back of the car but little else. In some of these films the shooting is hidden behind trees or buildings, people heads, and once it is even turned off moments before the President is killed. Great! How useful! We get to see a lot of Elm St. but little else. Many of these films show crowds after the event running up the grassy hill to the 'wooden fence'. Seeing this 5 or 6 times is as close to overkill as you can get. The DVD continues to let the amateur film to speak for itself. In doing say it says nothing. Even something like, ""The number of people running up there indicate a shot may have been fired from in front of the President"", would have been better than the dreary silence we are lulled with. There is 'some' commentary here, but only to explain what we are looking at in these 12 repetitive dull videos.""Here is Elm St."" etc. If Groden didn't tell we would be wondering what the point was. In fact, I'm still wondering. The only thing that might suprise you is how many people had video cameras that day. Bet they were all thinking, ""Damn! If only I had stood there where I could actually see something useful, then I would've made some big bucks!""
I found myself just skipping through these films, basically because it was all the same. The chapter list tells the story: Zapruder film, Bronson film, Little Miss Muffet's film. I can only assume Miss Muffet and co. didn't know the president was in town that day as he is all but invisible in the screen shot. Chapter 5 shows a film taken from the book depository but it swings irritatingly over the shooting scene and focuses on the city skyline missing everything. And so the DVD goes on, home video after home video, getting progressively unfocused and irrelevant. One film shows the presidential car shooting off down the highway after it has passed through the underpass. The `conspiracy' analysis here apparently has something to do with 2 kids waving who `didn't know the President had been shot.' Yup thanks Sherlock.
With all but no commentary the DVD in some degree allows us to 'look' and decide for ourselves. But look as we might there is nothing to see. I was expecting an intelligent and revealing dissection of the events and the people present etc. on the day. I was even hoping for some discussion of the events after the shooting, finding the magic bullet, the burnt autopsy notes, or anything which would leave me trembling with excitement about the idea of a conspiracy and the insidious heart of American politics. There was none whatsoever. This was soooooooo bland. If you are looking at this having seen Stone's JFK and are looking for a development, or a more historical analysis and presentation of the ideas presented in the trial scene then go somewhere else. Why this is called `case for conspiracy' is beyond me. There is no case presented as such. The only connection made to a 'conspiracy' is a comment made by Groden that some blurred mess which can be seen in the book depository windows is that of 3 men, which by extension 'means' there was a conspiracy. This was perhaps the most intriguing moment on the DVD, perhaps because I had been starved on any interesting for about 60 mins already.
I love the classic commentary made on the day, the 'put me on phil...put me on' and all the rest. This you can hear in a final 'bonus' but is played over images which are forgettable and irrelevant.
The 'production' was equally poor. From the first moments I found myself muttering 'Oh no, this looks bad'. Sure enough, first impressions never lie. I can handle a messy Zapruber film but the whole DVD looks like it has been put together in the back yard on Dad's old video machine.
Kennedy assasination freaks might love it as a 'historical document'. It might also be useful for those people who were there on the day and and want some SILENT historical record of the day.
For a conspiracy wait for the 'Garrison Tapes' to come out on DVD.

1923865,4,B0000DC14U,"This dvd is great and very affordable.  It features a treasure chest of rare footage of the motorcade and Dealey Plaza after the shooting.  The destruction of the single bullet theory is powerful.  The interviews with the Parkland and Betheda doctors, and their impressions of the official autopsy photos was very damaging to the Warren Commission.
My only complaints are the parts regarding new photographic evidence.  Blowing up a sixth floor window in a tiny photograph and showing a guys head that takes up the entire window and the ""black dog man"" analysis aren't really necessary.  The black dog man and the badgeman photos always bothered me since the evidence shows the shots came from behind the picket fence.. not that little pagola or whatever it's called.",1072742400,7,767,5.0078740157480315

1923867,4,B0000DC14U,"Just when you thought that the intrigue surrounding the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy couldn't be at a higher level, Robert Groden's ""JFK, The case for conspiracy."" DVD comes out.
 This Dvd is extremely interesting and unique.
 Groden, along with the narration of fellow JFK Assassination researcher Mark Crouch, takes us for a ride in JFK's motorcade.....literally!
  This Dvd has VERY rare footage (some of it possibly never before seen by the American public) of that fateful day in Dallas.
 From the moment that JFK left for Dallas, until the moment that the gunmen fired their shots, to the biggest lie in American political history (You know it as ""The Warren Report""), this DVD covers all of the bases.
  Groden, who is a photographic specialist, has meticulously studied all of the photos and films made in Dallas that day, and shares them with us, along with giving us his conclusions on what the photos show (Some of these conclusions will shock you to your core!) Beware though, as Groden also shows some of the JFK autopsy photos, although they SHOULD be included in this DVD, because to understand this case, you need to understand the medical evidence and how it was manipulated to deceive the American public.
The picture quality on this DVD is obviously not equal to an Oliver Stone movie, but still, Groden and company manage their limited resources and they have created an extremely interesting DVD that you won't forget anytime soon. In fact, you will have the ""Pause"" button on your DVD player worn out, because you will want to take in all of the minute detail of Groden's studies.
If the picture quality on this DVD was better, I would have given it 5 stars. It is that good!
 If you are a JFK Assassination researcher, or just someone who wants to learn some fascinating American history that the history books Omit, this DVD along with Groden's other DVD about the Kennedy Assassination are a MUST HAVE!
 Jesus said ""The truth shall set you free"". Well America doesnt have the truth about who killed our President. So what does that make us?",1066780800,65,2073,4.784313725490196
1923868,4,B0000DC14U,"This DVD, ""JFK Assassination files"" is extremely interesting and important, because it brings together for the first time in one collection, the complete filmed record of the JFK Assassination.
 This DVD contains the most famous amateur film ever shot, the famous (or infamous) Zapruder film, that shows the actual JFK Assassination in color.
  But what is special about this DVD is that it contains other films that were shot, including other vantage points of the JFK murder. That's right, most people believe that the Zapruder film is the only film that shows the assassination of President Kennedy.
 In truth, others filmed the murder as well, although not as clear as Zapruder did.
 There are many who believe that the Zapruder film has been tampered with. These other films may answer that question for you.
See for yourself, the blood chilling moment when the gunmen in Dallas took the life of a President, and the innocence of a Nation into their own, dirty, calculating, evil hands.
 The truth shall make us free.
Here's hoping we learn that truth someday.",1066694400,96,1065,4.955056179775281

1923873,3,B0000DC14U,"Robert Groden's books were among the first available ones that came out in the wake of the film JFK here in Australia, and were the first books I had read completely devoted to the JFK assassination. Prior to that I had read some articles out of mystery books, and in the late 80s I had a British magazine called ""Murder Casebook"" which profiled the assassination in one edition. Until the internet came along, it was very difficult to find JFK related material that was out of print over here.

So I consider this DVD a companion piece to his books ""The Killing Of A President"", which is mainly a photos source that would appeal even to sole assassin theorists because it is probably the best consolidated source for photos related to the assassination. I also bought ""The Search For Lee Harvey Oswald"" at around this time, but would not really relate it to this production.

However, I hadn't seen this program until recently, as it was never shown on TV in Oz (according to my knowledge), as I think I recorded every related show that I saw broadcast here for the last twenty years either on VHS or DVD.

This program obviously dates from the post-JFK movie period, as I think the movie did tend to spur the production of several documentaries on the subject. The transfer is clearly from a master VHS copy, and no attempt appears to have been made to clean up the footage, so you will see all the usual streaks and ""clarity"" that you will see in a VHS copy. Don't wait out for blu-ray, I think DVD is as good as it's going to get. If you want a hi-def copy of the Zapruder film, get the movie ""JFK"" on blu-ray (even if you don't believe in conspiracy, get it for the hi-def copy of the Z-Film).

So the start of this program is a series of amateur films of the arrival in Love Field of the JFK presidential party, and follows the motorcade into Dealey Plaza. Then, the Zapruder film is shown, with rifle shots spliced into when Groden believes the shots occurred. I thought this approach was quite clever, regardless if you believe the sequence as he sets down or not, as the sequence is timed fairly well to events occuring within the limousine. After that, the show uses primarily the Zapruder film, but also other films (most notably the Nix film), to rebuild the assassination sequence from Groden's point of view.

Naturally, the focus is on the destruction of the single bullet theory, and dispelling the notion of a headshot originating from the rear of the President (TSBD). Groden shows the various generations of the Zapruder film, including his stabilization methods which allow you to follow Kennedy's & Connally's movements seperately & in slow-mo so you can see their reactions within the car separately. This allows you to see details like the rear wound to Connally, a detail that can be picked up on the Z-film with surprising clarity. This method also clearly shows that blood doesn't start to develop on Connally's sleeve until later in the sequence.

The second half of the film goes into more detail in regards to the SBT, followed by interviews with some of the witnesses, primarily with doctors who were at Parkland Hospital frantically working on the expired President. Delaney is interesting, as he is under attack for back-tracking on his previous testimony after seeing the autopsy photos, which he endorses, while the other doctors, primarily McClelland & Peters, reject them as not being true representations of what they saw.

Personally, I think even the most ardent defender of the Warren Commission owes Bob Groden for the fact that the Zapruder film & the autopsy photos were finally made public, allowing the public to view them and make up their own mind. I would neither call Groden right or wrong on his views, but I do compliment him on stabilization & scoping which allow you to view areas of the Z-film in more detail.

If there is one thing that I probably share an opinion on with Groden, it is ""Black Dog Man"" and his pal, who appear most predominantly in the Willis serious of photos, and also get some airplay on this program. I've argued this point with sole assassin people in blogs, and most have a ""who cares"" mentality, but in Dealey Plaza we know the details of most witnesses, yet the few on the list we don't know of includes these two characters, who were situated right on the knoll, along the palisade - yards from the location where many witnesses claim to have heard a shot or shots.

My view in regards to these characters goes something like this: ok, so on the day these two characters that appear on the knoll are photographed fleeing the scene. Now, there may be an honest reason for them doing that, but if they were merely bystanders, why have they never come forward to identify who they are, what they were doing, and what they heard & saw ? ........to me, they are either brilliant witnesses or part of a plot, and by running away and never presenting themselves again, I tend to err towards the latter view (ironically, by coming forward, however, they may have even vindicated the official version, confirming that no shots were fired from the knoll). I mean, that Witt fellow came out and tried to identify himself as ""Umbrella Man"", which you could argue if he really was, but no-one has come forward that I know of claiming to be these guys on the knoll, despite the massive interest in the subject ever since the day it happened. My long-standing view of this aspect of the assassination is that if you were completely innocent, surely you would come forward and get your experiences of what you saw & heard on the record, and furthermore, eliminate yourself as a suspect. Surely every detective from Abberline to Columbo would understand the importance of eliminating them from suspicion !

Surprisingly, many conspiracy theorists ignore true questions of the assassination like that of ""black dog man"" and his pal, and latch onto stuff that has often been debunked. The movie JFK was brilliant for that - while much of the film was interesting, why Oliver Stone went with the guy having the epileptic fit as being part of a grand plot escapes me, as I seem to recall that the FBI identified him as early as 1964, so it appears to be in the debunked theory pile to me. Stone didn't even introduce the Vallee plot in Chicago, or Milteer in Miami, yet the long debunked epileptic story got a run, and so did the old canard about having the motorcade run down Main St, not Houston-Elm Streets, which could only have been done by removing the concrete sleepers that separate the convergence of Main & Elm Streets west of the overpass (do-able for the President, I guess) ???

Anyway, back onto this product, it's still ok as a DVD, and given the price, worth getting to study. The best DVD I've seen on the subject is ""Into Evidence"", which is simply hours of clips from presentations filmed at the 40th anniversary JFK Symposium (Groden was among those present), but it is quite dry, and is probably for the more advanced reader on the subject, as well as being over a hundred dollars per copy. Groden did another program that appears to have been part of this series that was a study of the various films taken in the plaza, which is quite good, but to my knowledge was never released on DVD, but it is quite interesting if you can get it. If you buy this DVD, enjoy the early 90s fashions amongst some of the witnesses & presenters, clothing & styles which I believe actually had their origins in the late 80s !

Also listen out for the music at the end credits, ""when the shots rang out in Dealey"" or something like that......I haven't heard that many assassination ballads, admittedly, but this one would be amongst the lamest !",1314489600,,7709,4.623082542001461
1923874,5,B0000DC14U,"This is a good film to start with in proving that there were multiple shooters, and that there was tampering with evidence and coverup right from the beginning. This documentary is filled with original footage and interviews with eyewitnesses.

Don't look for this to satisfy any deeper probing into who might have been involved in the plot. That is not the purpose of this film. It merely proves that there was more than one shooter, and that there was coverup.

How anyone can ignore the eyewitness testimony of about seven doctors, a nurse, and numerous others who actually saw Kennedy's head up close, is beyond me! Doctor McClelland stood with his face about eighteen inches directly above and looking into the head wound for about fifteen minutes. The back of Kennedy's head was clearly blown out by a front shot, and his brain leaking out of the wound. His wife stood in the emergency room with part of her husband's brain cupped in her hands, which she had earlier retrieved from the trunk surface immediately after the fatal front shot from the grassy knoll, which practically blew the President's head off.

This was a very straightforward and factual film of overwhelming eyewitness testimony. Who are YOU going to believe, government and mainstream media spindoctors, or eyewitness after eyewitness of doctors and professionals who were actually there? I for one go with the actual eyewitnesses and the actual film footage which is unmistakable in it's proof of multiple shooters.",1310947200,,1492,5.008064516129032
1923875,5,B0000DC14U,"Assassination researcher and conspiracy believer Robert Groden presents JFK: The Case For Conspiracy (1993), a fascinating 103-minute documentary that suggests there was a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy.  This documentary presents a treasure trove of convincing evidence.  You'll see never-before-seen footage of Love Field, the motorcade, what happened on Elm St., the outside of Parkland Hospital, interviews with doctors, autopsy photos, acoustic and ballistic evidence, in-depth analysis of the Zapruder film, photos of the Texas School Book Depository, where the shots came from, the wounds, and my favorite, the ""Black Dog Man"" who appears in the last frames of the Zapruder film, on photographs, and on the Orville Nix film.  As I watched the first fifteen or so minutes of the documentary, I was intrigued by the amount of footage that I had never seen before.

Some people complain that this documentary seems like it's cheaply made and lacks the professional quality of presentation that other documentaries have, such as the ABC News special JFK: Beyond Conspiracy and the many other JFK-related documentaries you see on the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.  Of course an independent researcher like Robert  Groden is not going to have the financial backing that these other documentaries get, so quality of presentation and even picture quality might suffer a little bit.  Some people go as far to say that the narrator isn't any good in this documentary.  I totally disagree.  I thought he did a good job.  The only documentaries that get huge financial backing are the ones that seem to want to prove that Oswald acted alone.

Depending on what poll you look at, anywhere from 66% to 80% of Americans believe in a conspiracy in this 47 year old case.  If you want to watch a documentary that is a reflection of how the vast majority of the American people view this case, then watch this one.  Highly recommended.",1296604800,,1941,5.066037735849057
1923876,4,B0000DC14U,"Mr. Groden's sombre narrative weaves in and out, very helpful but at times, a little shakey: how does he know that the people running up the knoll after the shots were chasing a figure with a weapon; or just trying to get out of harm's way? Also, all the slo'-mo's and freeze-frames do not prove that the fatal shot came from the right front. I'm a believer in that theory but this film has no expert explaining why or why not.

The real value is in the Review title here: we have seen the same bits and pieces for decades - now we have something new. Actually, there are many live and still pictures which will tear at your heart: seconds before the first shot you see a carfull of dignitaries, absolutely beaming at the unexpected reception.

1923877,5,B0000DC14U,"This was the first time I had seen the actual full-length coverage of the Kennedy assassination and it was horrifying and gut-wrenching.  I didn't see a president being assassinated, I saw a husband being murdered in a very gruesome way.  Whatever his flaws, you could tell his wife loved him and cared deeply for him.  I don't know why I haven't watched this until now, I guess partly because it's something else I would rather not have to deal with and it's become a big laughing matter in our society with a Seinfeld episode and the ""second spitter"".  It's also not something you talk about in ""polite"" company. It felt very much like it felt on 9/11.

The documentary starts with the news coverage of the president's arrival and then goes over every detail frame by frame; it goes over the autopsy photos, the medical artist renderings,  the photos and x-rays released on a FOIA request, the doctors and nurses' testimonies, the various video recordings and photographs and tells you what the Warren Commission found as well as what they covered up or ignored.

There's much to learn, I suppose I'll need to find the ""Popular Mechanics"" version of the story to understand what officialdom says on the matter.  However digging deeper doesn't mean that much to me because I know what the secret societies in control of our government are capable of.

It was nice to see the courage of the hundreds of citizens who charged the grassy knoll unafraid of a man who had a gun and had just murdered someone.  It was a satisfying look into the past and I had to wonder if the scared little lambs that call themselves Americans today would do the same or if they would flee in terror.

It also seems pointless to look further into this based on my experience with those who believe the government and mainstream media line on 9/11.  Not one person that I have come in contact with that believes the official conspiracy theory has ever looked into the evidence that contradicts it.  They stay in their safe little world of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity and the litany of liberal talk show hosts and say to themselves ""if it was a conspiracy, I would know, these people I trust would tell me so and more people would know.""  It's truth by numbers...a democracy of truth if you will--courage by numbers. It's a sad and disgusting commentary on society.  Anyway that is my experience. So long story short, I say to myself, what is the point?

""And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats -- having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men; Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills.""",1249948800,2,3136,4.664246823956443

Don't be fooled that it was ""a neuro-muscular reaction"" to the trauma of a shot from behind.  It's pure and simple physics that the motion of the presidents head, back and to the left is a reaction from being hit from the front and right.

What unspired my latest idea is this superlative documentary. We are not burdened with was-Oswald-really-a-patsy, or three guys from Paris contracted by three guys...... This program sticks to the assassination itself and the (apparent) absolutely irrefutable medical evidence of a right-front rifle shot. (Perhaps an unofficial ""PG"" is needed, in regard to autopsy photographs). The names and job-titles of non-scientic ""retouch"" artists are proviuded to further support the idea that Oswald committed the atrocity from his tall building perch.
One small point I believe they missed, on the rather protracted ""magic bullet"" aspect - recently it's been discovered/believed that Governor Connally was actually seated further to his left, which means that the ""stop in mid-air"" rhetoric might have *some* credibility, although we now know that Gerald Ford decided that the shot from behind was higher up on his torso than originally noted.
Mr. Groden's credentials are impeccable and his 1988 work is still right up there with the best and most objective authorities.
The most telling, disturbing, almost shocking detail is the statement that an armed gunman ran from the street scene, and was chased initially by three individuals - who (apparently) were never interviewed by the (basically well-intentioned) Warren Commussion - like the other many people who stood facing the Grassy Knoll.",1201737600,3,1645,5.480314960629921

This video, made back in 1992, has all the known videos on the JFK murder and analyzes them in more detail than I have seen. Notable are:

1) shocking evidence tampering by the Warren Commision:

the autopsy photos were outrageously altered, all doctors verify on video that the photos of the back of JFK's head is absolutely not the way they remember, and that the photos produced by the Warren Commision (or perhaps the US Military autopsy...where clearly some evil corruption took place) are completely fraudulent.

2) an image of a person in the top left most window of the school book depository, which is all one room, evidence that if Oswald was there, he would have had to have known about this other person. But this image, I think adds to my doubt about Oswald even being involved...I am basically going on the included people's statement ""frankly"", meaning that Frank Fiorini and Lee Oswald were the main shooters, but perhaps Oswald was involved but there were others with him. Clearly, JFK was hit in the back so somebody was there.

3) a simple fact that I had never heard or thought about until seeing this video that...if Oswald was on JFK's right, how could a wound on JFK's head exit on the front right side?

4) video of the so-called ""dog-man"", behind the fence moving from Nix's film

5) video of the grassy knoll person from Zupruter's film. I never knew that Zupruter actually filmed part of Fiorini's (or Hunt or Arnold's) head.

Plus ofcourse the famous colorized Mary Mormon? photo of the 3 stooges, Arnold, Fiorini, and Hunt behind the pick-fence. A very good DVD, and Groden appears to be an smart forthright and honest person.",1152576000,16,1827,4.617283950617284
1923894,5,B0000DC14U,"Imagine that: just 1 star by another reviewer for a DVD that is essentially the first comprehensive photographic record of the most important murder of the 20th Century!  Now, why do you think anyone might want to discourage you from seeing it?  Being a three-decade student of the JFK assassination, I watched both the Peter Jennings documentary (""Beyond Conspiracy"") and Dan Rather's earlier special.  They, along with the books ""Case Closed"" (a title which reflects the wishful thinking of surviving conspirators) and ""Marina and Lee,"" all recommended by our 1-star reviewer, are merely the latest slick, well-funded attempts to poison the well of truth.  If they can at least leave an uninformed public with the impression that the lone-gunman theory isn't totally laughable, then they can count these productions as money well-spent.

But, please by all means check them out.  Watch ""Beyond Conspiracy""...and then go to [...] and read ""A Critical Review of the TV Documentary `The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy'"" by Dr. Tony Austin.  Read ""Case Closed"" by Gerald Posner...and then buy ""The Great Zapruder Film Hoax"" by James Fetzer and a host of other film and photography experts.  See what Priscilla Johnson McMillan, long believed by many researchers to be a CIA operative with a role in handling Lee Harvey Oswald, has to say in her book ""Marina and Lee,"" but don't miss reading Mark Lane's ""Plausible Denial: Was the CIA Involved in the Assassination of JFK?""  And when you are done, you will be convinced of three truths: that a U.S. president was abruptly removed from office through a meticulously-designed act of treason involving well-placed government figures; that no grown person of average intellect who has actually studied one-tenth of the evidence for a conspiracy could still believe that the crime was committed by a nutty lone gunman; and that the continuing efforts to make this claim with a straight face in books and TV documentaries serve only as evidence that some powerful people still alive today are worried enough to keep muddying the water.

For those who seek the truth about who controls the world in which they live, Robert Groden's collection of priceless historical evidence (whether or not some of it was altered by the guilty) is unquestionably a treasure worth owning.",1151625600,47,2322,5.135278514588859
1923895,3,B0000DC14U,"Groden has done an excellent job of video remastering the films presented here but his work is inconclusive and does not present any hard evidence of a conspiracy. The single bullet theory is alive and well IMO. Perhaps Oswald had more time to shoot than originally thought because he fired the first shot earlier than first thought. A bystander (James Tague) was hit by a bullet fragment from that first shot. Oswald had time to regroup and fire the second shot which hit JFK at the base of the neck (in the rear) and passed through nicking the knot of his tie. Bullets tumble, slow down and do not maintain a straight line after they pass through a body (the bullet was in line to hit Connally without having to zig and zag). The governor was NOT sitting directly in front of JFK (he was seated left) nor was he at the same height in the car (he was lower and turning to right in response to the first shot). Elm St was slanted downwards plus the target was close to the shooter (JFK was only about 88 yards away from the Oswald rifle at the third shot).

The massive head wound JFK sustained was caused by a bullet entering the BACK of his head and exiting the right front. The particulate matter that sprayed everyone in the limo went to the FRONT not to the rear. All of the bullet fragments were found at the FRONT of the limo. I have seen no evidence of matter being sprayed to the trunk of the limo and I watched enhanced versions of the Zapruder film hundreds of times. The jerking and snapping back of JFK's head and body was caused by a neuro-muscular reaction to the destruction of the president's brain (BTW, there was a forward motion at the moment the bullet struck the president's head). The evidence is just not there for other shooters, period. No man hole shooter, no grassy knoll shooter and no Dal-Tex Bldg shooter.

Anyone who has studied the JFK assassination like I have can learn to appreciate conspiracy theorists or believers of the Warren Report. That said, everyone should read ""Case Closed"" by Gerald Posner with an open mind. You might see the assassination in a whole new light. By not reading that book and only reading and studying books and films that support the conspiracy theorists is just blind judgement and narrow mindedness. No true assassination buff can make valid arguments if all angles and viewpoints aren't explored and sorted out for their worth as truth or fiction.

 The documentary includes several video footage, including the infamous Zapruder film, and pictures taken by several witnesses. The movement of one of the killers in the knoll (shown in one of the films) shocked me. It's also amazing how the CIA/FBI investigators tried to cover up the case for conspiracy. Also, the video that shows one of the policemen turning on the mic on his radio near the motor of his motorcycle for the purpose of jamming the communications was very revealing. One image can say more than 1000 words. Just by looking at the movie, you can tell beyond any reasonable doubt that the last shot, the one that took 1/3 of his brain, came from the front. The last commission concluded that there 7 shots and at least 3 gunmen planted at the site in different locations. A further analysis revealed at least 4 shooters involved in the assassination.

1923898,1,B0000DC14U,"Robert Groden suggests that the Zapruder film of the Kennedy Assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of Kennedy.  In my opinion, his ""evidence"" is shaky at best.  Groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who ""really"" shot Kennedy, and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by ABC, CBS, and many books.  Groden needs to finally realize that the Kennedy assassination has been solved definitively, and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash-cow alive.

Don't draw a conclusion based on this DVD!  Look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion:

1.  ABC's Peter Jennings presentation of the Kennedy Assassination (available on Amazon.com) clearly shows that Oswald was the one and only killer of JFK.

2.  CBS's Dan Rather's special program on the Kennedy Assassination (available on CBS website) also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to Oswald as the lone killer.

3.  The book ""Case Closed"", by Gerald Posner.  He uses the physical evidence collected in Dallas, logic, and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that Lee Oswald is the lone assassin.

4.  The book ""Marina and Lee"", by Priscilla Johnson McMillian.  This book shows that Oswald was certainly capable of the assassination, and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed Kennedy.

My advice is to watch this DVD first, and then look at the sources I list above, and then make an intelligent conclusion.  If you are like me, you will see that Groden really has nothing solid to stand on.

1923903,2,B0000DC14U,"""JFK: The Case For Conspiracy"" is a nicely-constructed program -- put together and narrated by Robert J. Groden. It's also, IMO, a wholly-inaccurate program regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Mr. Groden sees ""conspiracy"" virtually everywhere. I disagree. IMO, one man (Lee Harvey Oswald) fired the only three shots at the President in 1963, taking the life of the 35th U.S. Commander-In-Chief.

One of the more humorous efforts by Mr. Groden to ""prove"" that a conspiracy existed in Dallas' Dealey Plaza is his assertion that the very blurry and grainy motion-picture sequence filmed by bystander Charles Bronson somehow verifies that MULTIPLE people can be detected just minutes prior to the assassination on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository (the floor where Oswald was seen firing a rifle and where Oswald's rifle was found after the shooting). But if one evaluates, even casually, this ""evidence"" that Mr. Groden says is concrete ""proof"" that reveals more than one person on the 6th Floor (and thereby proving conspiracy) -- the ""movement"" that Groden equates to ""people"" on the 6th Floor is EXACTLY the same kind of ""movement"" that can be seen dancing all over the BRICKS on the front of the Depository building! The ""movement"" appears to be nothing more than photographic grain and ""noise"" on Bronson's far-from-superior film.

Here's a list of questions I have for all ""Conspiracy Theorists"" (CTers) to reconcile.................

1.) Why, if the President was shot in the head from the FRONT (Grassy Knoll area), does JFK's head rock FORWARD slightly at the precise moment of the bullet's impact (from Z312 to Z313 in the famous ""Zapruder Film"")?

2.) Why is all the ""blood spray"" at Z313 TO THE FRONT of John Kennedy's head if the shot DIDN'T come from the rear?

3.) If JFK was shot at least once from the front, why were the only bullet fragments discovered in the limousine found near the front seat, i.e.: to the FRONT of the President in the car?

4.) For those who believe Oswald was nothing but a ""Patsy"" --- How did the conspirators orchestrating the ""Patsy Plot"" keep Oswald in a place where they KNEW for a fact Oswald would NOT be seen by anyone inside or outside the TSBD Building at the exact time of the assassination?

5.) For those who believe the slightly-differing theory that has Oswald ""knowingly involved"", but still a conspiracy existed --- Why didn't his fellow conspirators offer Oswald a ride away from the assassination scene? Why was Lee the only shooter/conspirator left out to dry in such a scenario?

6.) How could the conspirators possibly have managed to ""steal"" JFK's body after the assassination, in complete secrecy (as many theorists have postulated)? -- (From either the heavily-guarded Air Force One aircraft at Love Field, or at Andrews AFB, or at Parkland Hospital?)

7.) Why would conspirators feel the need to FAKE and ""plant"" THREE different ""Backyard Photos"" depicting Oswald prior to the assassination -- when zero were really needed to link Oswald with .... A.) The rifle; B.) The revolver; and C.) Oswald's ties to Russia?

8.) Why did multiple HSCA investigators declare that the ""Backyard Photos"" were ""authentic""? Were all of these people who looked at the pictures conspirators too?

9.) If Jack Ruby was ""assigned"" to rub out Oswald as part of a conspiracy, why then did Ruby take the time to send a stripper a Money Order just 4 minutes prior to his ""appointment"" with Oswald?

10.) Why would Ruby have taken his adored dog with him to a pre-planned killing from which he had to KNOW he would not return to his vehicle?

11.) Why did Oswald kill policeman J.D. Tippit, if Oswald had NOT just 45 minutes earlier killed JFK?

12.) Why do so many people totally disregard the testimony of up to 10 witnesses who positively identified Oswald as the man who (alone) killed Tippit (or saw him flee immediately afterward)? Conspiracy theorists, instead, seem to rely heavily on the sole testimony of Mrs. Acquilla Clemons about having seen two men, neither one Oswald. *

* = If you want my pure guess on Clemons' account -- She's obviously confused on her ""timing"" here. She saw heavy-set Ted Callaway take Tippit's own gun from under his dead body and run away with the gun (to go and hunt down Oswald). She is attributing CALLAWAY as one of the ""killers"" of Tippit, IMO.

13.) How did the conspirators (in a ""Patsy"" scenario) get this lucky? ----> The ONE MAN they are trying to ""set up"" for the JFK murder just happens to get himself hired by Roy Truly at the Depository weeks before anyone knew of the motorcade through Dallas. **

** = And the popular theory that Oswald was somehow ""placed"" in the building by conspirators won't hold even an ounce of water -- because we know Oswald got the Depository job through recommendations of friends and neighbors, including Ruth Paine and 19-year-old stock man Wesley Frazier and his sister.

14.) Why didn't conspirators ""eliminate"" Oswald much earlier than the morning of November 24th? IMO, in any conspiracy plot that is going to require Oswald being ""rubbed out"", letting Oswald live for even an hour after the assassination makes little to no sense.

15.) Why does Oswald spin lie after lie to the police after he's arrested (IF he's completely innocent of killing anyone, as he screamed to the waiting press, on November 22nd)?

16.) What was in that ""package"" of Oswald's the morning of 11/22 (if NOT a rifle with serial number C2766)? Oswald's ""curtain rod"" story won't fly either.

17.) After his arrest, why didn't Oswald spill his guts about ANY conspiracy plan he was involved in? Just saying the words ""I'm just a patsy"" one time doesn't cut it. If he KNEW that SOME type of ""plot"" was ""going down"" on 11/22, then it stands to reason that he would have talked like a singing jaybird after he was caught. And to believe that he DID talk (and gave names of co-conspirators) is to implicate multiple police officials, etc., in the ""plot"" to cover-up the truth (Fritz, Curry, Leavelle, Wade, et al). And THAT is just silly on its face, IMO. ***

*** = Oswald's ""Patsy"" quote, BTW, has actually been taken somewhat out of context (if you think about exactly WHEN he uttered his famous ""Patsy"" statement). Oswald stated he was a ""Patsy"" ONLY after ALSO declaring the obvious lie of: ""They've taken me in because of the fact I've lived in the Soviet Union"". ... Therefore, he's not specifically saying he's being used as a ""Patsy"" by conspirators who are trying to frame him for a murder he never committed. He's saying here that he's being used as a ""Patsy"" by the Dallas Police Department because of the mere fact he defected to Russia. Big difference. And seeing as how we KNOW for a fact that his ""Soviet Union"" line of dialogue is nothing but a lie, then WHY would we (the public and the press) be expected to suddenly believe he's NOW telling us the truth when he spouts ""I'm just a patsy"" just one second later? One lie feeds the other, in my estimation.

1923904,3,B0000DC14U,"This DVD is useful for the fact that it collects all the video taken that day, very interesting for anyone with more than a passing interest in the assassination. The title is VERY misleading, however, as no case is made for any conspiracy.  Still, for a completist this is useful stuff.

If you're looking for more, like the reviewer from Australia, you're bound to be disappointed. Still, when he laughably asks for the 'sound' of the assassination to made available (such a thing doesn't exist, or there would be no controversy), and looks to the very silly Oliver Stone for inspiration, not much more can be expected.

The editorial review of this DVD is curious in that it lauds Mr Groden's expertise in photographic matters, despite his utter humiliation in the O.J. Simpson case. Nevertheless, one can be a conspiracy nut (and this man is one of the worst) and yet present some videos in an inoffensive manner, which he manages well enough.",1106438400,9,947,4.7975460122699385

But one thing is FACT in this whole case.......there was a Conspiracy against JFK & so far our own government & law enforcement has been reluctant to figure this out & they refuse to release all the sealed documents which won't be released in about 30 or so years (if they ever do release them).

The only reason for the concealment of some of the documents of the investigation of the JFK assasination would be in order to hide the truth, after all thats why the military/government labels certain documents ""classified"". The point is to hide the truth! DUH!

1923908,1,B0000DC14U,"This DVD would form a good companion to the movie JFK about which director Oliver Stone ADMITS that he made up facts. He now calls the movie JFK ""an alternative myth"". I trust that the conspiracy industry knows what the word ""myth"" means! Oliver now says that he used ""dramatic licence"" in making the film. This can also be said of this documentary as the man that made this also was an adviser on the JFK film.
Why do we have so many documetaries like this? The answer is money for it has become a money-making industry.
We have had others-like those that claim Elvis is still alive,the ridiculous Moon landing conspiracy documentaries,the Nostradamus documentaries that told us the world was going to end in 1999 and so on.
As long as some people are gullible,then this sort of rubbish will come out.
Fans would be better off buying The ABC News Presents ""The Kennedy Assassination-Beyond Conspiracy"",a documentary which has interviews with Oswald's relatives and has proof that he did the assassination.",1083888000,9,1006,4.854651162790698
1923909,5,B0000DC14U,"This Robert Groden-produced program provides a comprehensive view of all the available professional and amateur films taken on November 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Elm Street in downtown Dallas, Texas. Groden also serves as narrator on this program, which is slightly mis-titled on the DVD cover -- it should say ""Films"" instead of ""Files""; it DOES, in fact, say ""FILMS"" on the DVD Menu screen.

Each of these more than one dozen films has been ""optically enhanced"" for the best possible video quality. I've seen these films presented on other videos -- but, I must admit, many of these sequences look better than ever before thanks to the clean-up and enhancement effort done for this program.

Each film appears to be *complete* in each case, as well. With nothing trimmed off the beginning or the end, which is valuable from a ""completist"" (and historical) standpoint.  Two good examples of this come in the chapters for the ""Zapruder"" film and the ""Mark Bell"" sequence -- with each of these films containing footage on this DVD that is not normally shown on JFK documentaries or assassination videos.

The very beginning of Abraham Zapruder's film is shown here, which includes a couple seconds of footage taken a few minutes before the Presidential motorcade arrived  in Dealey Plaza that November afternoon. These very first frames show two people sitting on one of the park benches located on the ""Grassy Knoll"", as well as Mr. Zapruder's assistant, Marilyn Sitzman, standing in front of this bench.  Sitzman turns to face Zapruder's camera just before this segment ends. The film then goes directly to the famous footage of the motorcade motorcycles turning onto Elm Street.

The version of the Mark Bell film on this DVD is also of interest for its ""complete"" length.  After the motorcade is seen leaving Dealey Plaza, Bell filmed some additional footage from an elevated position, across the street from the Elm Street activity.  This footage is not usually shown when Mr. Bell's film is utilized for a video, etc.

The Zapruder Film, which is the most famous of any of the motion pictures taken on 11/22/1963 (and the only one to show the entire assassination from beginning to its gruesome end), is given the most detailed examination in this program (and rightly so). A variety of different copies of the ""Z-Film"" are shown here, and it's quite interesting to see how lousy some of the original copies are.  But, along with a bad-looking copy or two, Groden also shows us some ""enhanced"" copies as well; plus an original ""unspliced"" copy of the famous home movie, which Groden had in his possession before the film was accidentally damaged by the Life Magazine people shortly after that company purchased the original film from Zapruder.

Other films shown on this DVD (in addition to Zapruder's and Bell's) include the footage taken by: Orville Nix, Marie Muchmore, Robert Hughes, Tina Towner, Elsie Dorman, Charles Bronson, Tom Alyea, Jack Daniel, Ernest Mentesana, John Martin, Mal Couch, and NBC cameraman Dave Wiegman.

Wiegman's original film is one of the most chilling taken in Dealey Plaza that day.  Wiegman was riding in one of the ""Press"" cars (just a few car-lengths behind JFK's limousine). Just as the shots rang out, Wiegman jumped from his car, camera rolling, and ran toward the action taking place in front of him. His film is a total blur in many places, because he's running as he's filming. But it's a fascinating piece of film, nonetheless.

Elsie Dorman's film is quite interesting as well, mainly because of Dorman's location at the time she filmed the motorcade -- the location in question being the very same building from which the fatal shots were fired -- the Texas School Book Depository.  Dorman was filming from the 4th Floor of the Depository, two floors below Lee Harvey Oswald's 6th-Floor sniper's perch.  Dorman's film, therefore, gives us a similar view of the limousine to that of what Oswald would have been seeing at the exact same moments.

Thankfully (in my opinion anyway), Groden's narration focuses primarily on just the content of the various films themselves. He just briefly interjects his beliefs that some of the images we are seeing within these amateur films ""proves a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy"".

I, for one, do not subscribe to any of the many conspiracy scenarios that have been formulated since JFK's murder. In my view, Lee Oswald was the one and only killer located in Dealey Plaza on November 22nd.  Of course, many people (most, actually) will vehemently disagree.  But, so be it.

But, even for a person who advocates the ""Lone Nut Assassin"" scenario, this DVD is still a very worthwhile addition to the ol' Digital collection, for one very good reason -- this program collects ALL of the available assassination-related films and puts them all onto a single DVD. Plus, it's nice to be able to have this complete filmed record of November 22nd on the higher-quality DVD format.  And being able to go directly to any of the various films via the disc's ""Chapter"" selection is also a handy and time-saving advantage over a VHS taped version.",1083715200,43,5166,4.939953810623557

It contains a very clear print of the Famous Zapruder home movie which shows frame 213 Kennedy's head opening up & a mass of blood and debris clouding around his head at impact of the bullet!  Another film of Dealy Plaza shows an outside view in color of the Texas School book Depository Building and officers running towards TSBD in search of the elusive assassin. And the discovery of another rifle a Mauser IN side the TSBD building.  It has some other raw footage of JFK's limo coming around the corner of Elm st. And a good clip of JFK & Jackie in the back seats of the car before he shortly came to his tragic end waving to the ,exicited crowd that came to welcome them.

And mostly this famous Robert Groden film contains different versions of the famous Zapruder film in slow motion shot at different speeds. So that you can zoom in and see in slow motion for yourself that tragic day in Dallas.
