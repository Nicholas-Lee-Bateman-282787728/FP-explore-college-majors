1344495,5,B00004RYSN,"Speed(1994) is a really good remake of Bullet Train(1975). Keanu Reeves is gonna rip your spine out!  The late Dennis Hopper played Howard Payne, a disgruntled ex-bomb squad officer who plants a bomb on a public bus and demands extortion money in return. Keanu Reeves was cast as Jack, a bomb squad officer trying to save people. Sandra Bullock was cast as Annie. She has to drive the bus after the bus driver is shot by a gun in a mishap. Jeff Daniels was cast as Harry, Jack's friend. Joe Morton was cast as Mac, Jack's superior. Speed works. There's flashy special effects, Dennis Hopper is a cold blooded bad guy, there's suspense, pathos, and we care about the innocent people that the villain wants to hurt.
The music score by Mark Mancina is really cool. DUN DUN DUN DA DAT DAT DAT! DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Speed(1994) was spoofed on The Critic as ""Speed Reading"". Homer on The Simpsons referenced it while tampering with a CCTV camera. Speed got an R rating from the MPAA.
There's some foul language and some characters are brutally murdered by the villain. Speed is a movie that deserves a place in a movie collection.",1520985600,,1124,4.564356435643564

1344544,4,B00004RYSN,"You either like Keanu or you don't.  This film is typical Keanu stuff, with him looking good and very capable with the physical part of his role, while mumbling and stumbling thru his dialog;  Ah, blah mum mum blah ah, mum hmmm . . .

Anyway, this film features Dennis Hopper (a whacko from WAY back, try ""Easy Rider"" with Jack Nicholson circa 1968?) who hatches a bazaar plot to extort money from some California city (LA?).  Hopper's character plants a bomb on a city bus which is programmed to detonate if the bus fails to maintain a speed over 50mph.  The only thing more ridiculous than the plot is the bus jump stunt which looks so bad, you'll wish they hadn't filmed it in slow motion LOL.  The 1994 film sports ""slick"" electronics equipment (employed by Hopper) which look feeble by today's standards.  Sandra Bullock and supporting cast are typical of this genre.

Like I said, if you like Keanu, it's a must see, if not, it's just another action film and DEFINITELY NOT as good as ""The Taking of Pelham 123"", either one!
My wife likes Keanu.  I think he's just OK.  They say he's a regular guy.",1491523200,,1104,4.475

1344553,5,B00004RYSN,"Umpteenth viewing held up just fine.  Last seen years ago, so a lot of the details had faded a bit, but I knew every scene and a lot of the dialogue.  But it was instructive to see it again while also enjoying a goodly amount of it.  The film's hardly dated except for the ten pound mobile phones they used, but the biggest gripe that I had -- even in the first viewing -- is still there:  no way was the bus going over 50 for most of the b-roll shots.  A big bother.  Also was surprised to see Sandy's role being secondary.  I forgot that.  She wasn't even in the first half.  Hard to say why the film still worked.  The memes are still used today, so that was core, but I think the pacing was crucial, and the acting was fine but the script was comic-bookish.  Future me: don't watch again.  It'd take ten years to forget enough, and by then, a ten pound phone is just going to make you throw up.",1488585600,,898,4.0685714285714285

1344574,5,B00004RYSN,"Mechanic Terry Martin (Jimmy Stewart), the chief car tester for Emery Motors, is working on a revolutionary new carburetor. Hes having trouble, not just with the carburetor, but with the firms engineer who constantly stands over his shoulder and is getting in the way of his romantic pursuit of the company's publicity director, Jane Mitchell (Wendy Barrie). Testing takes them to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where Martin crashes, and to Rogers Dry Lake in the Californian High Desert, where Martin crashes again while in pursuit of the World Land Speed Record. He doesnt win on the track, but he does win the affection of Ms. Mitchell. Speed was Stewarts first role as a leading man, and one of eight--yes eight--movies he made in 1936. The film was notable for its realistic cinematography by Lester White, incorporating scenes from the Indy 500 with on-location shoots at Murac, where Stewart did his own stunt driving. Scenes inside the automobile factory were shot at Chrysler, where the vaunted Chrysler Airflow was in production. Not the best racing picture perhaps, but it has the best-dressed actors. Stewart, Barrie and the entire cast wear superbly tailored clothes throughout. Five stars, for the strong nostalgia factor.",1481155200,,1238,5.195

It carried the Die Hard torch into the 90's with a different kind of action hero, who was more into actually doing his job than wisecracking (Keanu's own objections had something to do with steering the hero away from the Die Hard mold, and Joss Whedon was called in as script doctor).  Keanu did a lot of his own action, the rapport between he and Sandra Bullock was excellent, as well as his reunion with Dennis Hopper, and most ladies would agree that in a long career of a most attractive actor, his appearance here set a new benchmark for male hotness.",1474329600,,685,4.524193548387097

One of those we didn't wanna end! Product was delivered with no problems as well.",1469145600,,398,4.32

1344607,5,B00004RYSN,"As far as action-packed thrill rides go, this film does it well. It paces itself well, never overburdens its characters or viewers with obstacles, and has a solid plot throughout.
  Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are a police officer and civilian thrust into a madmans scheme to extort the city of Los Angeles. Bomb threats are nothing new in cinema, but throwing in a bus that must continue speeding is a unique twist. Its handled in a believable manner, especially given that the LAPD as a whole is aware of the situation from the beginning and helps to save lives.
  Reeves and Bullock embrace their roles and their casual chemistry is believable. Later interactions seem more force and it seems that Hollywood inserted that relationship last minute to complete this hard-core action film. In my opinion, we were better off without those thirty seconds of the movie. Otherwise, these two are right for these rolesthe cop wanting to beat the bad guy and his sick game and the woman who just wants to go home at the end of the day. She could have just shot him down and that would have been the end of it.
  On the other side, Dennis Hopper delivers a strong performance as the madman with an ingenious plan. He plays it so we know hes off but not to the point where hes completely lost his head (pun intended.) Its conceivable for him to do what he did and come up with that plan. Hes smart enough to change things up when coming across an obstacle. Hes a villain suited for the film.
  Sadly, the film did not have enough of Jeff Daniels, but he did well with what he was given. He and the rest of the police made great supporting characters as they worked to figure out how to beat the bomb and save everyone. Their trials, triumphs, and setbacks all build up the tension and excitement.
  So, if you want a solid action film, you cant go wrong with this one. Great characters, a good plot, and plenty of excitement ensure a positive viewing experience. Enjoy.",1467676800,,1965,4.509859154929577

1344623,5,B00004RYSN,"This  movie  amazes  me  every  time  I  watch  it,  It  stars  Sandra Bullock  Dennis Hopper Jeff Daniels,  &  Keanu Reeves.  All  very  good  actors  that  I'm  pretty  familiar  with.  The  expert  Bomber  known  as  Howard  takes  a  bus  hostage.  Nothing  will  hardly  go  unnoticed  because  he  has  somehow  tapped  into  the  camera  on  the  bus.  If  you  break  his  rules  there  will  be  a  lethal  penalty.  You  either  obey  him  or  else. Dennis  gives  great  performance  on  his  script.  Who  plays  the  invincible  bad  guy,  that  Jack  is  determined  to  get.  I  wouldn't  blame  him  that  much  if  he  wanted  to  tare  the  guys  heart  out.  He  was  a  pain  in  the  Butt.  The  elevator  shaft  bomb  was  just  a  taste  of  how  good  this  madman  was.
The  main  thing  is,  is  that  he's  after  a  bag  of  money  which  someone  planted  on  the  bus  &  was  supposed  to  be  delivered  to  him.  &  is  supposed  to  be  his  retirement  investment.  He  says  he  feels  like  he  earned  that  money,  &  will  not  rest  until  he  receives  it.  So  the  bus  doesn't  stop  or  slow  down  after  it  reaches  55  miles  per  hour  or  it'll  explode.  Nobody  gets  off  the  bus,  {Just sit  back  &  enjoy  the  ride  &  no  one  will  get  hurt.}  Okay  I  get  the  idea.  At  least  45  mins  on  this  ride,  taking  a  big  portion  of  the  movie.  The  stunts  were  so  real,  jumping  an  unfinished  bridge  on  the  freeway,  The  bus  making  sharp  turns  at  several  traffic  lights,  The  train  reaching  the  deadend  point  in  the  subway  &  ramming  right  through  it  into  the  street,  &  Jack  hanging  on  for  dear  life  under  the  bus  when  he  loses  the  dolly  thing  he  was  using. Jack  also  goes  under  the  bus  &  gets  a  good  look  at  the  bomb  but  fails  to  disarm  it,  That's  dangerous  what  he  was  doing.  Kind  of  like  a  scene  from  the  Indiana  Jones  movies,  I  just  loved  how  he  attempted  bravery  to  end  the  crazy  Joy  ride  &  everyone  else  could  finally  get  off  the  bus.  If  that's  not  enough  for  you  the  wild  unstoppable  train  ride  is  much  more  then  any  roller  coaster.  The  movie  though  does  blow  me  away.  I  Love  it!
This  movie  really  uplifted  Keanu's  acting  career.  He  does  a  great  job  using  his  head  &  looking  for  a  way  to  outwit  this  dude  &  bring  him  down.
Rest  assured  I  don't  think  there  is  any  way  I'd  ever  give  this  one  up.  I'll  say  its  pretty  much  a  number  1  movie  for  the  year  1995.  I  think  that's  when  it  came  out.  The  movie  has  lasted  ever  since  it  came  out.  &  I  don't  see  how  it  could  ever  fail.

1344673,5,B00004RYSN,"SPEED (1994) is one of the few 90s action flicks that holds up to me. I'd only seen it once a long time ago, but having re-visited it recently, I was immediately drawn into it and it was like discovering a new friend! Aside from the main original plot of the bus having to stay above 50mph or it explodes, the film contains the common tropes in many an action flick: the slick, good-looking heroic cop whose smarter than everyone else (Keanu Reeves), the crusty, been-there-done-that sidekick (Jeff Daniels), the love interest (Sandra Bullock), and the psychotic very verbal villain of the piece (Dennis Hopper). But somehow Speed manages to turn these commonalities into something that seems original.

First and foremost, I've to say that I think that THIS film contains the absolute best performance that Keanu Reeves has ever given! I couldn't believe how authentic he seemed as a cop and how natural his performance was when I saw this again recently. He's been so noticeably bad in many other things, but he nailed this performance! Not one false note the whole time. Reeves plays Jack Traven, an LAPD member of the S.W.A.T. team who has an innate ability to sniff out and read the criminal mind. In particular, he's had a lot of experience of dealing with bombers, all shapes and sizes. Jeff Daniels plays Traven's partner Harry, the older wiser world-weary cop closer to retirement. But Reeves and Daniels have a believable yin-yang chemistry that makes their relationship rise above the cliches. The 2 cops end up going toe to toe with the film's antagonist bomber Payne, well played by Dennis Hopper, who was pretty much playing the role of the psychopathic criminal on a loop during this time. It's really just Dennis Hopper being Dennis Hopper! Finally, there's the requisite love interest Annie, here wonderfully played by Sandra Bullock, in essence her breakout film role that made the world take notice. Yet the difference in this film than most other action flicks is that Annie is not the typical useless love interest there just for her looks, but actually has a larger purpose to the main plot. Annie is a passenger on the infamous bus that Jack must board in order to defuse Payne's complicated bomb. Then the Jack-Annie relationship actually unfolds on the bus in a refreshing and surprisingly convincing manner.

Director Jan DeBont deftly takes all the cliches and turns them on their heads, delivering a rather original film experience. The pacing of Speed is perfection. It starts off with a bang, the superbly staged elevator bomb scene, and essentially never lets up. Yet in the midst of all the action, the dialogue is very good and characters act and react in a believable manner. Speed has the advantage of being simultaneously claustrophobic AND outdoorsy and most of the action takes place on the crowded bus, but also we get many exterior scenes of the bus manipulating itself through LA traffic and highways. The action sequences all work. DeBont basically took a silly plot, twisted the cliches into something believable, got a strong lead performance out of Keanu Reeves, a good supporting cast, and made an action film for the ages!",1445126400,,3169,4.899441340782123

1344722,5,B00004RYSN,"This is a favorite movie of mine.  I watched it previously and just watched it twice in the last few days.  While as always, there are plot inconsistencies, but they do not detract from the pleasure of the movie.  Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy who wants adn believes he is entitled to $3.7 million in retirement pay.  The movie is in 3 parrts.  First Hopper is trying threatening tp kill a bunch of people in an elevator. Blackmail on Hopper's part to get the $3.7 million.  Kenu Reeves as Jack Travel and his partner stop him and believe they have killed him.  However, Hopper survives and next threatens to blow up a fully loaded bus in the second phase.  Bacause Hopper wants Jack T dead and his money, there are two goals his time.  The gurgeous Sandra Bullock tranformed into the bus driver. Eventually after many excitements, Hopper is stopped again, although the $3.7 miillion is paid.  Reeves and Bullock are falling in love.  The third phase is Reeves, Bullock and Hopper on a subway train.  Reeves and Bullock survive a train crash.  And the ending is Rreeves and Bullock getting all mushy (as Bullock says),  I highly recommend the movie for anyone who likes bad guy provding a lot of action with a substanial love interest.",1430352000,,1237,4.614678899082569

1344726,5,B00004RYSN,"I used to own ""Speed"" on laserdisc, but then 10-12 years ago I made the final switch to dvd and got rid of my laserdisc player and the last of my discs. Among them ""Speed"", which I never got around to buying on dvd and that's a crying shame, since ""Speed is one of the finest action movies ever made - and coincidently the movie more than any, that made the careers of both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, catapulting both to instant super-stardom. Now - finally - I have come arund to buying a copy on dvd, and the movie hasn't faded even a bit. Not much in the form of special-features though. But never mind.

""Speed"" is the story of 2 tac-team cops, a beautiful girl, a mad bomber..... and a BUS. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and partner (Jeff Daniels) are called to a highrise building, where the mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) is holding 13 people hostage onboard an express elevator, threatening to blow the clamps, preventing the elevator from falling, taking the 13 people inside to their deaths. The cops manage to rescue the hostages though, which our unpleasant psychopath takes rather personal, since it prevents him from collecting the 3,7 million dollars, he was demanding. He escapes the building by faking his own death in a massiv explosion.

He doesn't stay dead though, but rather returns with a vengange. He hijacks a city bus full of passengers, plants a bomb set to go of if the bus slows to a speed below 50. It's now up to Jack Traven to board the bus and keep it above 50, while his partner tracks down the bomber, who turns out to be an ex-cop by the name of Howard Payne. Did I mention that by a twist of fate our young wildcat Annie (Sandra Bullock) ends up behind the wheel of the bus?! Things don't go as planned though and Traven's partner ends up dead. And Paynes comment to the unfolding of events: We all know he was the brains of your particular operation. In fact the movie has quite a few memorable one-liners, so here are a couple to end my review: I'm smarter than you. I'm smarter than you. Yeah, but I'm taler.",1429315200,,2047,4.427055702917772

1344743,1,B00004RYSN,"for some reason this classic 90's Action thriller first blu-ray release over 8 years ago now
didn't have any of the behind the scenes featurettes from the 2 Disc special edition DVD
the only extras carried over to the blu-ray version was the Audio commentary tracks that's all
very very pathetic

well 8 years later 20th century fox decides to release the film on blu-ray again as a 20th Anniversary edition
with Different cover art saying 20th Anniversary
well this new reissue should not be marketed as 20th Anniversary release at all
the new reissue has the exact same special features as the old blu-ray release, nothing has changed at all
there's over 30mins of behind the scenes footage from the 2 Disc special edition DVD
which still has not been carried over to this new 20th Anniversary blu-ray
Disgusting effort by 20th century fox
i have no idea if the blu-ray transfer has been enhanced, improved for this new reissue, maybe it has, maybe it has not
i would be surprised if the film was given a new transfer

one of my favourite action thrillers ever is SPEED and it Deserves more respect than it's been given
there's no reason at all why 20th century fox would not or could not carry over all the special features to this new blu-ray version
i mean the behind the scenes featurettes, not just the Audio commentary tracks which are the only extras on the blu-ray
Disgusting effort, disrespectful for sure
once again i'm staying with my old 2 Disc special edition DVD
this new blu-ray reissue should not be called 20th anniversary edition, a big ripoff
1 star i gave it not worth anything",1423526400,,1599,4.646643109540636

1344811,4,B00004RYSN,Nonstop action. The bus jumping the gap in the highway takes your breath away. Dennis Hopper is a great villain and Reaves and Bullock are tops.,1404000000,,144,4.576923076923077

1344813,4,B00004RYSN,"It's kind of funny how Speed gets lumped in with so many other '90s blockbusters as being big, loud and dumb and the epitome of what was wrong with movies at the time. It's certainly not cerebral, highbrow cinema but it's a lot more character focused than its reputation would have one believe. Sandra Bullock anchors the thing well. And Keanu Reeves, despite his surfer dude drawl, shows just why he's managed to carve out a continued screen presence because, despite the inherent silliness of the material, he sells it. He buys into the reality of what's going on and never acts like the material is beneath him. (Though that's mostly what Dennis Hopper is doing.) Also, for all the bombast and fury of the movie, there's no way that a similar type of blockbuster would ever be made today entirely with practical effects like this. It may be a silly movie, but it always felt real, largely because it kind of was thanks that sort of commitment. If that isn't enough to convince you, this was written by Justified showrunner Graham Yost and had a major dialogue rebuff by none other than Joss Whedon.",1403136000,,1101,4.651282051282052

1344816,5,B00004RYSN,A great action movie that I have watched numerous items and never get bored of! One of Keanu's best movies in my opinion. You won't be disappointed with this movie if you have never seen it!!,1402099200,,191,4.333333333333333
1344817,5,B00004RYSN,"This is a movie that is quite literally timeless.  It is a visual stunner and the dialogue is simply outstanding.

Meanwhile, ""Speed"" remains as one of Keanu Reeves' better movies.",1399852800,,288,4.76
1344820,5,B00004RYSN,"This was one of the best action/thrillers of 1994.  All three actors were at their best, particularly Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper.  Hopper was especially convincing as the madman intent on his warped revenge.  Bullock was both humorous and believable in her role as the drafted bus driver.  The action sequences were quite believable, even for that time period before computer generated action sequences.

  A film I feel many would enjoy for pure escapism.i",1399766400,,463,5.175675675675675

1344826,5,B00004RYSN,"Yes Sir! Reeves becomes a real star with this one (excluding the Matrix series), as well as Bullock.  Hopper was already a star of the ""crazed nut"" genre and adds to his resume.  Very nice DVD that will certainly keep the viewer awake, and on the edge of their seat!",1395964800,,266,4.3

1344829,4,B00004RYSN,so-so story line but enough action to keep anyone awake.  Romantic ending to please the girl crowd.  I recommend it,1393891200,,115,4.7
1344830,5,B00004RYSN,This is a classic film that really put Keanu over the top as far as action roles. Dennis Hopper did excellent job as the ex cop gone bad along with Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock rounding out the main characters.,1393545600,,213,4.35
1344831,5,B00004RYSN,Keanu Reeves at this best. I wish he would have stayed in rolls like this one. This and Point Break are old favorites.,1392854400,,118,4.173913043478261

Its just as good today as it was yesterday, and will continue to be in the future. This review is simply to say that if you're looking to buy this title and want to know which edition is better, the Award Series edition or the 5-Star Collection edition, im here to say that they are both identical. Both have the same special features etc. So buy whichever one you can get cheaper and enjoy!!!!",1389484800,,561,4.403846153846154

And then there is the action part of it of course which makes it a pleaser for all concerned: some seriously testosterone-ridden scenes with some equally touching moments re: friendship and romance.  Dennis Hopper is at his evil best with maniacal laugh and all.  It's a good time!",1385510400,,422,4.526315789473684

1344861,4,B00004RYSN,"Almost time for its 20th Anniversary but still moving along. This is the first time I have seen the movie and was happy to find that age has not stunted its entertainment value. There are other bus sagas, but this one tries to match the many 'train out of control' films; only in this case, it is a necessity to keep it moving above a certain speed or it will explode.  There were a few incidents when the LA police are seen falling for tricks that were old when Dennis Hopper (then the oldest of the stars) was born. I suppose the writers can be forgiven since these were probably required to prepare the way for later scenes. At any rate, there is plenty of action, starred actors played their roles well (with Dennis Hopper, no doubt, encouraged to do his Mad Scientist bit of rug chewing) and the supporting cast did so, too.
While not in the category of best in its class, it is good and lively viewing for any action fan.",1376524800,,927,4.327586206896552

1344904,5,B00004RYSN,"This movie is awesome and very well acted. Anybody who says Keanu Reeves is a stiff with no emotional depth needs to watch this movie. He has some of the best lines and he shows his humorous side as well as his serious side. He can act and this movie proved that a move to action was a very smart move. He, also, was wise to turn down Speed 2 which sucked big time. He lights up the screen and is buff, hot and looking good, not to mention that he looks good in the S.W.A.T. uniform. He is definitely not the character from Bill and Ted here and I liked those too. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times and it never fails to engage me. The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock comes across on the screen and they are believable. It is 2 hours of non stop action and if you are a fan Of Keanu Reeves, as I am, then it should be in your movie library. Especially on blu-ray as the movie looks like it was made today not 18 years ago.",1347926400,,955,4.005235602094241

1344908,4,B00004RYSN,"I have the Standard Def 5 Star Version of Speed and thought I'd pick up the Blu Ray version.  The Standard Def version did have DTS 5.1 audio which is rare on regular DVDs and that version was really quite good.  So what could I expect with the Blu Ray version. For one thing, the audio is DTS HD loss less and does a credible job of tracking movement though out the sound stage.  There are times when the musical part of the audio overwhelms what may have been discreet channeling of the various foley effects but I did not find that too bothersome.  The audio here is quite good but unless you have a really fine home theater set up, I do not think you will hear much difference between the two versions.

The video transfer is excellent with no observable grain or artifacting.  Then again, the SD version was almost as good if not equal in my opinion.

For those interested in extras, the 2 disc standard version had plenty of good extras aside from the standard commentary.  The making of the bus jumping scene was a thrill to see.  On the Blu Ray version, other than the commentary, there really are no extras.  There is a very silly game included that bored me after the first try or two.  How they can call Scene Selection an 'Extra' is beyond my understanding.  There are no deleted or extended scenes.

If you don't already have the film on DVD than, certainly, the Blu Ray is the one to get, but if you already own the 2 disc set I do not believe that you will get a significant difference in quality in the upgrade.

For those interested in the story line and acting..you can't beat Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock is still a budding star.  Kneau Reeves in this pre Matrix film gets his feet wet as the action hero.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

1344909,3,B00004RYSN,"This is an excellent thriller. Except for the last 20 minutes, the logic is generally ok (though why does one cop deliberately shoot another?). The camera work is good (not too much blurring and shaking of the camera). The characters are likable. Great stunts. Quite enjoyable.

The last 20 minutes nearly ruin the whole thing. The plot becomes illogical and absurd. That's where the movie lost a star on my ratings.",1339200000,,416,4.859154929577465

1344911,5,B00004RYSN,"Like I've said many times, it's easy to look at some movies from the future. I too remember when this movie came out in 94', the concept had never been done before. A bus has a bomb on it, if it goes below 50 miles per hour. Well then BOOM, but jack Traven played by Keanu Reeves is on the scene. Having foiled the bombers previous attempt to get his ransom money, he's now after Jack, I think what some people don't realize is, there are some movies that are just meant to be over the top. For example, one reviewers ripped this movie apart but praised ""Diehard"". But what that person failed to realize is, would a visiting police officer all by himself be able to take down an entire group of Terrorists, as John Mcclain did In Diehard. The answer to that is no, but we still watch it and enjoy it. Same with ""Speed"", plus Keanu isn't made to do too much in this movie. Sandra Bullock gives a solid performance in supporting role, and Dennis Hopper steals this movie, playing the bomber in an over the top manner. Perfect for a mindless action movie, I do not know about rewrites. But I can tell you, the way the movie is now is better than it could have been. After hardly meeting Harry, played by Jeff Daniels. In the begining of the movie, I never would have bought him as the bomber. And yes, those bus cameras are better than people think they are, or were, Particularly when Payne realizes what Jack did to the camera. It zooms in on Annie's jacket, and you can recognize the Wildcat logo. For a friday night, or saturday popcorn movie, I recommend it.",1331683200,,1560,4.32764505119454
1344912,2,B00004RYSN,"For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.

Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.

Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.

Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.

Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).

Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.

Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.

Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years.

The Blu Ray presents the film in a nice, clean, if unspectacular 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a bunch of extras ported over from the ancient DVD.",1330905600,,4140,4.6850068775790925

1344917,4,B00004RYSN,"Usually numb Keanu Reeves shows remarkable action hero status as a L.A. police officer who gets sucked into a series of ransom demands from a crazed ex-cop and bomb making specialist (Dennis Hopper).  The film's opening in a high rise is often forgotten but is the equal to the rest of the film.  Here, Jack (Reeves) and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) rescue a half dozen employees from an elevator loaded with a bomb and remote control activator.  Of course, ""Speed"" is mostly known for the non-stop action that involves a city bus full of passengers included spunky Annie (a terrific Sandra Bullock).  She is forced into action as the bus driver and must keep the bus above 50 MPH.  The film never lets up even when you think all is well.  The script is nicely developed and damn if director Jon de Bont doesn't pull it all off with a minimum of pyrotechnics (don't worry there's still plenty) and a maximum of tension and terror.

1344927,3,B00004RYSN,"This aged just a bit better than I'd remembered, although admittedly I didn't have the fondest recollections of it. In essence it's a nonstop barrage of action clichs that doesn't try to step out of its own way, choosing instead to embrace the stereotypes and come up with a few new ones along the way. Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration. Dennis Hopper is noteworthy as the preposterously over-the-top mad bomber; he serves up several great lines that sent me backwards through decades' worth of pop culture nostalgia.",1308787200,,941,4.7439024390243905

1344930,4,B00004RYSN,"Keanu Reeves is as wooden as the desk my keyboard rests on, and he has about as much range as a slug on an ice cube, but in the case of SPEED I could not possibly care less.  Paired with the feisty, super cute Sandra Bullock, and pitted against Dennis Hopper, who is as good as it gets as an uber villain, Keanu is surprisingly palatable (if not totally forgettable) in SPEED, one of the best high octane action films on the planet.

Yes, we're all familiar with the plot:  when SWAT cop Jack Traven (Reeves) and his partner, Harry (Jeff Daniels), foil a terrorist/ransom plot at an LA high rise, maniacal villain Howard Payne (Hopper) reacts worse than the proverbial woman scorned.  He rigs a city transport bus with explosives, then activates the bomb once it's in motion; if the bus ever slows below 50 mph, it's curtains for those unfortunates on board.  Of course, good ol' Jack delivers himself for the rescue (via a commandeered convertible, of course) and, aided by Bullock's bewildered character, who takes over when the bus driver is shot, this ADD thriller really starts to move.  Is all of it over the top, with most of Reeves's action sequences in the cartoon realm?  And is the ending so silly and disbelieving the viewer is chuckling at the zaniness?  Absolutely, but who cares?  SPEED is a white knuckler thriller that will have you turning somersaults from your couch.  If you haven't seen SPEED, you're way overdue for a grand roller coaster ride.  Just make sure your heart meds are on hand.

Before many days have gone by, the bomber rigs a city bus with an explosive device that will arm once the bus hits 50 MPH--and explode if it drops below that speed.  Trapped on board with a group of passengers, it's up to Jack to figure out how the bomber knows what's going on, then trick him long enough to get the people off.  Sandra Bullock is great as Annie Porter, who takes over the wheel when the driver is accidentally wounded, and the steadily ratcheting tension--even after you've seen it once or twice--equals any superhero flick around.  The late Dennis Hopper is also very effective as disabled former-cop-turned-extortionist Howard Payne.

1344934,4,B00004RYSN,"Veteran cinematographer Jan de Bont, whose credits included Die Hard (1988), Jewel of the Nile (1986), and Basic Instinct (1992), makes his directorial debut in Speed (1994), one of those pure action films, where if you just enjoy the ride, and don't bother to question its many logical fallacies, you should have a fun and entertaining time.  De Bont, delivers a slick looking film, with some well executed and edgy action sequences.  Star Keanu Reeves', bold determination, and physical skills, serve him very well here.

Greed and revenge, drive ex-cop and demolition expert, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), after his scheme to extort money is foiled by LA police officers Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels).  Believed dead, Payne shocks Traven with the news that he has wired a bus with explosives that will detonate, if its speed dips below 50 mph.  Jack jumps aboard Bus 2525, looking to save lives, but when the driver is accidentally shot, passenger Annie Potter (Sandra Bullock), takes his place behind the wheel.  The action moves at a brisk pace, as the bus races through the streets of LA, leaving wreckage in its wake.  Replacing Annie, is apparently never a consideration, and the bus amazingly winds up alone, on an unused section of freeway.  After completing an impossible jump, the bus heads for LAX, where it can safely cruise and maintain the required speed.

The excitement continues, as Jack gets on a dolly, and slides below the bus to try and disarm the bomb, nearly losing the skin off his back.  Meanwhile, Temple is hot on Payne's trail, but unfortunately gets too close.  With fuel running low, the police mount a rescue mission that succeeds in freeing the hostages.  They spring a trap to try and catch Payne, but he strikes first, grabbing Annie as a hostage, dragging her aboard a subway train, for yet another dangerous ride.

Speed delivers thrills, but is too squeaky clean to be taken seriously, with lighted elevator shafts constructed like nothing on this planet, buses with pristine undersides, spotless subway cars, and immaculate subway tunnels.  Blood, dirt, darkness, grease, garbage, and graffiti, almost seem not to belong in this reality.

Playing a crazed criminal is familiar territory for Dennis Hopper, and he does a fine job of pushing Jack's buttons, without quite losing control until the very end.  Sandra Bullock was relatively new, but well suited to the role of a sharp tongued smart mouth, with a heart of gold.  The 'opposites attract' formula seems to apply to Jack and Annie, but her observation that 'relationships that start under intense circumstances . . . never last', foreshadows future events.  Speed gave Bullock's career a major boost, and she would team again with Jan de Bont, for the sequel Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), however Reeves would not participate.

It is not too hard to look past its faults, and accept Speed for the fun ride it is intended to be.  The film does not deviate from a course of straight ahead action, and Reeves and Bullock make a fairly good pair.  Dennis Hopper, adds a nice bit of madness to the mix, making for some solidly entertaining fun.  Billy Idol's end credit number 'Speed', like Ratt's 'Nobody Rides For Free' in Point Break (1991), finishes another Keanu Reeves cop outing with some balls.",1267315200,,3327,4.935368043087971

1344948,5,B00004RYSN,"Blu-rays are about picture and sound quality.  A review of Blu-ray edition of an old 1994 movie should be addressing the issue of added entertainment value when upgrading to the Blu-ray edition, not the story itself, which we are all familiar with.

A dvd of this movie cost a bomb back in the day.  It has been shown countless times on free to air TV.  I saw this movie in a theatre way back in 1994.  Nostalgia made me buy Blu-rays of this movie along with Blu-ray Black Hawk Down, both at the same price.  Naturally, I saw Black Hawk Down first, reserving Speed for later.

I totally underestimated SPEED.  With the Blu-ray, (I hook up my TV to Bose 901 speakers) I was transported back to the cinema hall.  The sound from the Blu-ray was awesome.  Every explosion, collision, aeroplane, helicopter had a deep and tight bass sensurround sound.  The bass on my speakers were truly put to the test.  The deep rumblings of the bus and the sound of the crashing of the bus were true to life.  Sounds were moving to and fro Left and Right speakers positioning the bus, helicopters and gunshots correctly.  This made the Blu-ray worth every cent.  The dialogue was crisp.  I switched off the sub-titles and just enjoyed the whole Blu-ray performance, even though I had seen this movie on Full Screen TV free so many times before.  With Blu-ray, this appeared to be a different movie altogether.

I cannot complain about the picture quality, although others might expect a better transfer.  I can see every wrinkle on Dennis Hopper's face and the individual hairs on every actor's head in close-ups.  For a 1994 movie, that is good enough for me.  Colour saturation was good.  The picture quality surpasses that of many Blu-rays which cost a lot more, and which are of more recent vintage.

Probably one of the most well spent $12.99 (price at the time of this review).  The Blu-ray release surpasses expectations.  Black Hawk Down has a more sombre theme, but somehow, the gunfire and helicopter crashes sound muted compared to SPEED.  I expected better from Blu-ray Black Hawk Down and for value added by the Blu-ray edition.  Blu-ray Black Hawk Down was better than the dvd, but it did not have the massive improvement Blu-ray brought to SPEED.  The acoustics in SPEED sounded better than the recent Fast and Furious series of Blu-rays, to me anyway.

I am not in the position to comment about technical specifications, but for a person who has been disappointed by a lot of Blu-ray upgrades, SPEED added so much more enjoyment for such a small investment.

If Blu-rays reviews ignored the content and were rated according to ""How much more did the Blu-ray edition add to your enjoyment of the movie compared to the dvd version"", I would say SPEED BD would rank in the top few.  Gladiator Blu-ray, on the other hand, would rank in the bottom few (if you ignored the 5 star contents).

And if you do not have a copy of SPEED, go straight for the affordable Blu-ray version of SPEED.  I experienced a ressurection of a movie I once wrote off as ""old"".  Excellent value for money.",1255132800,,3076,4.635185185185185

I still have no idea how they were able to film scenes on the slow-moving freeways of Southern California, but they sure accomplished in what they wanted and needed. Reeves, Bullock, Hopper, Daniels, and Morton give marvelous performances throughout the film. Hopper especially steals the show as the maniacal bomber who will stop at nothing in order to get what he wants. Mark Mancina's music score adds finer touches to this highly popular action film, while John Wright's editing really hits the spot.

1344954,5,B00004RYSN,"Speed is a great action movie. It's got a cool set-up, it wastes no time jumping directly into the action, and it's got excitement that never lets up.

Keanu Reeves plays Jack Travern, an officer with the LAPD, who along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) saves an elevator fill of people from a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper). By the end of it, it seems that the bomber is dead and the two are awarded medals for their bravery. Soon after, a bus blows up before Jack's eyes and the bomber calls him to give him the set-up. There is another bus with a bomb on it. The bomb will be activated once the bus reached 50 miles per house. If it drops below 50, it will explode. Furthermore, the bomber wants 3 million dollars by 11 a.m. Once on the bus, Jack meets Annie (Sandra Bullock), a loud-mouthed, charming passenger who ends up driving the death trap while the bomber watches the action play out on TV.

The idea isn't very original, but screenwriter Graham Yost kicks the thing into overdrive the minute the film begins. He also throws a few curveballs every couple of minutes to keep the audience on their feet. The excitement, tension, and suspense the film creates does not die down until the credits finally roll.

With that said, Keanu Reeves isn't very convincing at times. In the first few minutes he appears fidgety (no joke) and confused. Physically, he fits the role pretty well but the man endlessly struggles to deliver his dialogue convincingly. You'll know what I mean when he says ""there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world."" Luckily, Reeves doesn't need to be very good because (A) it's an action movie and (B) it is so well made that everyone else is good enough to offset the man.

If Bullock's role has been cast differently, many of the scenes on the bus (roughly 85% of the movie) wouldn't have worked as well. Her charm, even when her character gets rather is annoying, is what really counteracts some of Reeves' more annoying acting qualities. I'll take it a step further by saying I don't think Bullock has been more charming. She's cute and gritty enough to pull off her role perfectly.

Hopper could sleep walk through this role as he's accustomed to playing it at this point. He's still appropriately diabolical. Finally, Jeff Daniels turns in strong supporting work as Jack's partner.

It's funny though; despite my paragraph about Reeves, I can't really picture anyone else in this role and I'm not sure I'd want anyone else. But, moving on, the movie is one long, great action scene and it's unlikely you'll find an action film more entertaining. Some of the dialogue's not that great (or maybe it's just Reeves' delivery), but everything about this movie makes it so superior to other movies in its genre.

1344970,4,B00004RYSN,"Speed is kind of like Die Hard on wheels.  In both films there is a hostage situation, while a madman demands money or else people are going to die.  The cast, acting, dialouge and story are not as sharp in Speed as Die Hard IMHO, but what makes Speed uniqely different is that the entire movie isn't focused into a single structure.  Instead, we are on a Los Angeles public bus that cannot travel under 50 mph or else the bomb underneath will detonate.  The stage is therefore set for non-stop speeding thrills and suspense.

The movie has 3 main stages.  The majority of the film is the bus, but before that begins the film starts off immediately with an introduction to our villain Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), an ex-cop who places a bomb in a tower elevator and the L.A. officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) sent to neautralize the bomb and rescue the hostages caught in the elevator.  While it does provide the film with an instant scene of suspense, it's nearly 30 minutes in length and after a few viewings of Speed, I am more than ready for our bus scene.

The next hour of the film is the bus.  Payne has planted a bomb underneath, and racing down the L.A. freeway comes the bus, and anything in its path better be ready to duck, jump, or get run over.  An unfortunate accident on board places an every day young woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) in the driver's seat, while officer Jack jumps on board to do his best to control the situation.  But Payne is one smart bombmaker, and almost every scenario is pre-thought out leaving Jack with little time to come up with a plan.  Meanwhile the bus has until 11am, or Payne receives his money, before it blows.

The final scene is a little unnecessary but set up to take control of our villain once and for all.  This scene takes place on the subway, in an abondoned subway car that is speeding out of control.  After a wild ride for an hour or so on the bus, the subway scene is little exciting, and like I said, feels like it was thrown in the mix just to wrap things up.

Overall, Speed succeeds by providing great action and thrills that almost never let up.  There are moments when I felt I was one of those every day passengers on that bus.  But then when I listen to dialouge and some rough acting by the majority of the supporting cast, I remember its just a movie.  Nevertheless, Speed is original and effective for what it is.  It is a classic in its own right.

1344971,5,B00004RYSN,"One of the most legendary of action movies (and deservedly so) ""Speed"" is a full-octane thrill ride bolstered by great performances and an unusually potent level of character interaction.  In revenge for the foiling of his plot to hold an elevatorful of hostages for ransom, a maniacal villain (Dennis Hopper) targets one of the cops who stopped him (Keanu Reeves) by launching a plot that makes him responsible for saving a busload of civillians.  With the bus wired with a bomb that will detonate if its speed drops below fifty miles an hour - intentionally making Reeves's attempt to board and save it a suicide bid - Hopper demands another ransom, thus going after revenge and profit in the same gambit.

  As in most of the best action movies, the deck is really stacked against the movie's protagonist.  The bus can't slow down, it can't stop at red lights, it can't be refueled, and it's forbidden for anyone to try to leave the bus: with helicopter news crews capturing the whole thing live, Hopper can monitor events at leisure from his hideout.  Sandra Bullock plays Annie, a girl who ends up driving the bus after its original driver is incapacitated early on, and the great chemistry between her and Reeves is a big plus in the movie (that chemistry worked again a few years later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000HEWEE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)</a>).

You know the old-fashioned type movie-making when the audience gets a chance to catch its breath and anticipate the action to come. Maybe even a few minutes of human interest. But that pause never came. Then after the second 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls-- about the time the bus blows up the airplane real good-- I figured the pause had to come. But no, it never did. Instead, there was another 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, and about the time the subway began to get a mind of its own, something really strange happened. I realized I had gotten bored. Now you wouldn't think that with all that non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, a viewer could actually get bored. But I was. Something, I think, about too much of one thing becoming first familiar, then old, and finally tedious. Then when the non-stop action and hair-raising close calls finally did come to a stop, as all things must, I had my final revelation. What I had just sat through only looked like a real life movie.

1344986,5,B00004RYSN,"I haven't watched Speed in many years.  Now the timeless classic is on Blu-ray in all it's cinematic glory.  These movies make it clear why Blu-ray is what the director intended his movie to look like after all these years.  After all the movies that have come out recently that use computer graphics it's great to watch a movie that uses traditional special effects and stunts.

Speed could be considered an epic in what it has done for action movies.  The sit on the edge non-stop unpredictable action that makes movies like this great.  The name of the movie implies what the movie is about.  Dennis Hopper plays a deranged man who is out to get what he believes is his.  He will do anything to get it including killing dozens of people.  The only thing that stands in his way is an action cop played by Keanu Reeves.

Although some of the acting could be considered cheesy at parts it is still good.  Sandra Bullock does an excellent job in one her first big movies.  This movie did enough to put these stars on the blockbuster map.  Of course after watching the movie some of the scenes are very unrealistic but that is why you need to watch the movie without being a critic which is sometimes hard for me.

I bought the DVD for a much closer look at Joss Whedon's uncredited dialogue and came away with a new awareness of the film's plot holes and irrational construction, most of which are pointed out (nearly celebrated) by Graham Yost and Mark Gordon on the second commentary.

It's that commentary track that makes this purchase valuable to me, beyond the very interesting camera operation and the peculiarities of story.

Yost and Gordon self-dissect this film in ways that illustrate the processes and creative decisions that lead an action-audience to a desired end, which is also an adequate working definition of pornography.

1345000,4,B00004RYSN,"This 1994 matchup of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock would not be the last pairing of this couple. This fortunate outcome for movie viewers makes it even more fascinating to watch the chemistry between the two back in 1994 when they did not trip off the tongue easily as a twinned male-female leads.

The flashes of humor that pass between them in this flick are brilliant, all the more so because the bomb-rigged bus they're maneuvering through LA, knowing that if bus and passengers will blow up if their speed goes below 50 mph, provides a death trap as a background.

The two wryly observe that relationships that begin under high-stress circumstances don't last. This reviewer is glad to file Bullock and Reeves in SPEED as an exception.

Dennis Hopper pulls a great turn as a heartless but very smart psycho terrorist. He's only in it for the money, so the show can move on without having to get the audience up to speed on any complicated grievances flowing from the past into Hopper's absurdly expressive brain.

Back to Reeves and Bullock, it's almost preternatural how cool the former can appear and how girl-next-door the latter. A lot of cinematic water has flowed under the bridge since the first SPEED back in the 90's. Reeves' and Bullocks repertoires have considerably expanded.

Unfortunately, this badguy has only just begun. Jack ends up entangled within a dangerous web spun by a mind bent on revenge and mayhem -- and it soon becomes personal. He ends up among the passengers of a public transportation bus that has been wired with a bomb. Once the bus goes above 50 MPH, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, there's gonna be a hell of a mess to clean up. The crazed villain demands money as well as full cooperation from Jack and the local police force. But Jack knows that if anybody's going to make it out of this alive, the rules must be bent and the bomber must be outsmarted. Yet with so little time and many hazards, is that even possible?

Speed (1994) is one of those instant action/thriller classics that popped out of the 80s and 90s. It may not have any Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it does have some major suspense, superb acting, a solid script, and tons of booms and bangs to satisfy any fan of the genre. My favorite aspect of Speed (and I doubt I'm alone in this) is Dennis Hopper as Howard Payne -- the out-of-his-mind kook who's causing all the trouble. Hopper has always had that edgy, slightly crazy feel about him, and it goes very well with the violent antics and intriguing dialogue of his charatcer. Overall, it's definitely white-knuckled entertainment with the first viewing, but still maintains its appeal time and time again. In the end, it's all just another thrill-ride that steps out of the bounds of reality to give folks a good old-fashioned action flick, but come on, isn't that we wanted?",1155340800,,1816,4.604938271604938

Of course, ""My Private Idaho"" showed us how good an actor he really is, but too few people saw that strange, excellent film.  Here he's great; sexy, competant, and with that edginess necessary to all action heroes.  And this movie delivers.  Action all the way, with Dennis Hopper, the perfect villain, and a strong female lead, a hero in her own right, who doesn't fall apart when everything else does.  It is violent, with a couple of gory scenes and extremely fast- paced.  I noticed in the beginning, when Reeves and the always excellent Jeff Daniels first arrive at the bomb site, as they prepare to go in, the camera moves around them in such a way, as to aid the impression of urgency and speed.  It was very good.  The bus leaping the 50-foot gap was the only scene that didn't work, as you could clearly see it sinking before they cut to the next shot where it hits the other side, tail end miraculously up instead of down.  And it sure looked like they blew up a real plane.  Hopper was truly creepy, playing his role with such understatement, as if this was all so ordinary.

I just wanna point this out, cause so many people love to write reviews for things that they wouldn't generally care for, which is pretty worthless.  I have nothing against 'Speed' in theory, or action movies in theory, anyway.  Basically, 'Speed' lives on its gimmicky premise.  The trouble is, this premise proves to be exceedingly dull.  Riding the bus is not especially thrilling.  In fact, actually riding the bus is more interesting than this film: there are often crazy people on the real bus.  Also, you can play a game to try and determine which of the 5 cell phone conversations that you are overhearing is the most asinine. (This is futile, however.  They are all always banal beyond belief.)  Then the movie goes on for a lot longer than it should've, and simply becomes silly and moronic rather than tedious, so it covers all its bases, I guess.  Also, it has the obnoxious, loathsome Sandra Bullock and a particularly dull Keanu Reeves.  Hopper hams it up, as he ought to, but he's a lot less fun than usual.  That's the ultimate problem with this movie-- it's stupid and tedious, but in a pious, serious way.  You can't laugh at this the way you can lotsa crappy action movies.

And then there is the closing scene in the train that serves as sort of epilogue for the movie. The movie wrapped things up quite well. When all the action was done, the movie actually ended in a postponed and obligatory romance between Reeves and Bullock.

I will give him credit, however, for taking a storyline that is thinner than a strand silk and squeezing out a 1 1/2 hour movie. The low point is the last scene when Sandra Bullock has somehow survived a gigantic train wreck handcuffed to handrail without getting her hands ripped off and she and Keanu Reeves calmly enjoy a long kiss and talk about all the great sex they are going to have.  This pathetic last-ditch effort to try to create a storyline made me gag.

1345018,5,B00004RYSN,"It's interesting re-watching this film after 11 years that it still manages to hold up despite a few predictable spots, it still manages to be quite energetic and fun. It's always interesting that Keanu ""one expression"" Reeves can act even if other movies suggest something else.

In one of the commentaries, one mentions that there's 2 types of films: premise and character. Meaning that it's either about an event or something happening or it's just a character study. This has a big premise. A bomber wants 3.7 million and he decides to set bombs up on an elevator and if he doesn't get money, there goes the emergency brakes and whoosh, right to the bottom floor. So Keanu basically foils his plan and gets awarded.

Only bomber isn't done and decides to put a bomb on a bus that if it goes under a certain speed it'll blow up. And for a good part of the film it's trying to get this bus to stay above 50 miles an hour with all sorts of obstacles in a way.

It's funny watching the moments that keeps up the tension because they're so ""yeah right!"" that they seem totally implausible but yet they could happen, just probably not all in a row. Keanu boards the bus only to deal with an ex-criminal who causes an accident which causes a scene of unloading someone only then to have to deal with a jump over a 50 feet gap then to deal with a leaking gas pump. All of this one after another but you'd probably wouldn't pay attention to those things cause the movie's so fun.

Like a blockbuster should be it introduced some new pop culture phrases: ""pop quiz hotshot"" ""what do you do, what do you do?"", showed Keanu was more than Bill and Ted, Jan de Bont was a capable director since this was his first time(however don't forget he did make Speed 2) and it also stars sweetly cute Sandra Bullock.

Dennis Hopper's character was the unofficial star of the film, his deed was the film's plot, but he had the least amount of screen time.  When he did make an appearance you paid attention, wondering what this psychopath (""...with fingers numbering 9"") was going to do next.

Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock had great on-screen chemistry (which I understand they're trying to duplicate in another movie).  Dennis Hopper played his part so well that you just wanted to put him through a wall for being one step ahead of the good guys.

My problem with the movie ultimately is SPEED should have ended after the bus exploded.  The writers could have come up with a more interesting and definite ending for Hopper's character.  The addition of the speeding train only proved an excess to what had been a crisp, fluent movie.  By going this far over the limit of audience tolerance, DeBont and crew sabotaged what should have been a five star movie.

1345026,5,B00004RYSN,"I absolutely love this movie! Alongside Titanic & Pearl Harbour (see, I have no taste in films, according to some) this is one of my favourite movies. I remember the first time I watched this, it was on TV, and I was still in my early teens. I found the start credits extremely boring, and then Dennis Hopper stabbing the guy in the head (well, I'm guessing that hurt), got me interested. And then Keanu Reeves (Jack Traven) came on screen, and the whole world just stopped. You know what that's like when you see a really cute guy (or girl, whatever your preference)? This film got me obsessed with Keanu, and even though he's done some rather daft movies in his time, this isn't one of them. Although it took me another couple of years to see the whole of it, as I got told to stop watching it due to the swearing. Give me a break, I was only young - my mum seems to think I picked my language from somewhere else, when really, it was from her!

I'm notorious for defending Speed, and probably will do until my death. No one can forget it was the same Keanu who was in Bill & Ted, or they'll do silly impressions ""This bus will exploooooooooodddddddddddeeeeeeeeeee"". Good grief, if you don't like the film don't watch it. People definitely have something against Keanu being in this movie, but lets face it, he got this role over loads of others: Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Johnny Depp, Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. Would any of them have filled the role the way Keanu did? The answer is no.

What amazes me about this movie, is the chemistry between Jack & Annie (Sandra Bullock). They are (now) two of my favourite actors, and it's just the way they look at each other in the movie - makes you go all gooey inside. Awwwww! This was the movie that shot Sandra to stardom, although she's great in a previous movie, Demolition Man.

For the third time in a row, I'm reviewing a movie that involves a lot of driving. The stunt drivers, or someone pulling the bus is shown loads in the extras of this - really disappointing when you're a young innocent, who thought that Sandra could really drive like that! Twelve buses were used, including two which exploded; one for the freeway jump; one for high-speed scenes; and one used solely for 'under bus' shots. The bus jump scene was done twice, as the bus landed too smoothly the first time. The bridge was actually there, but erased digitally.

Apart from Keanu & Sandra, there are some great actors in this: Glenn Plummer, Jeff Bridges, Joe Morton, Dennis Hopper etc. Glenn Plummer is fantastic, and also appears in the sequel. He also got his licence taken away two days before he was due to start filming!

The extras on this DVD are fantastic, and will keep you occupied for a wee while. They include: commentary by Jan DeBont; commentary by writer Graham Yost and producer Mark Gordon; extended scenes (""Jack Shoots Payne in the Neck,"" ""Payne Lives/Cops' Party,"" ""Annie's Job,"" ""After Helen's Death,"" ""Ray's Crime""); easter eggs (DVD Credits, Airline Version of Bus Crash - which are where?!); Inside Speed Featurettes on the location, stunts and visual effects; production design (60 stills); original screenplay (240 stills); action sequence featurettes on the ""Bus Jump"" and ""Metro Rail Crash""; multi-angle shots with audio (""Bus Jump"" - 9 angles, ""Cargo Jet Explosion"" - 9 angles, ""Jack vs. Payne"" - 4 angles, ""Metro Rail Crash"" - 9 angles); multi-stream storyboards (""Bomb on the Bus,"" ""Baker Sequence,"" ""Bus Jump,"" ""Metro Rail Fight & Crash""); interview archive (with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and Jan De Bont); HBO Special; Trailer & 11 TV Spots; Billy Idol Music Video; press kit; production notes (40 stills) and image gallery (various stills).

This is a great movie, ignore all the so-called critics, who don't like it. I love it. Although Keanu doesn't appear in the sequel, this is one of his roles that far stands out, and beats the Matrix trilogy hands down.",1099094400,,3977,4.69054441260745

1345028,5,B00004RYSN,"On occasion, I crave for good action entertainment...but Jan De Bont's SPEED isn't just good, it's well-nigh spectacular. I watched this movie many years ago on video, and the sheer suspense and excitement its simple premise generated gripped me from start to finish. As far as I know, this is arguably the most perfect pure-action action movie I've seen yet.

  Of course you know the premise: mad terrorist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) plants a bomb on an LA bus that will explode if the bus moves at over 50 mph at any point, and it is us to supercop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) to foil Payne's plans. From that simple idea, though, director De Bont and screenwriter Graham Yost craft a crackling action thriller that moves from setpiece to setpiece, sustaining momentum all the way through. In lesser hands, SPEED might have seemed merely jagged, but De Bont skillfully hold it all together through sheer high energy. (This was De Bont's directorial debut, but perhaps his experience shooting action films like the classic DIE HARD helped him here in some way.)

  The result is one of the best, most exhilarating of modern action films. Yost carries through his sipmle but creative premise without resorting to worn-out action cliches (there is no silly digital readout accompanying the bomb, for instance), and in his pursuit of action excitement he doesn't forget to bring his characters closer to the audience via colorful, distinctive dialogue. We always relate to the hero, and for this kind of action film, that's a good thing. The performances more or less get the job done, although Sandra Bullock shows a lot of appealing spunk in her heroine role---it's easy to see why she became a star after this movie. Reeves does well with the action heroics, and he is always convincing in his role. As for Hopper, as the creatively-named (hehe) villain, he shows once again (like he did in David Lynch's BLUE VELVET) that he is one of the best in the business at playing bad guys. He sure is bad, but Hopper brings a distinctive, almost charismatic, style to what could have been a generic villain performance in less experienced hands. And, of course, the action scenes are beyond reproach. Who could forget the bus' miraculous leap into the air as it attempts to jump across a gap in the highway? And the finale is simply spectacular, with a train derailment that John McTiernan tried to ape in the subsequent year in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.

  In short, if you're looking for high action entertainment that may not necessarily revolutize the genre but gets the job done smashingly, SPEED fits the bill marvelously. I mean, with a title like that, which action-film fan could resist? Highly recommended.",1090627200,,2712,4.852813852813853
1345029,5,B00004RYSN,"SPEED has been one of the handful of movies made in the last ten years that I keep coming back to again and again when I need an action fix. I think it's partly because its premise is so impossibly simple: there's a bomb on a bus that will go boom if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour. That's it. I also think it's also because for all the noise and action, it really doesn't take itself too seriously. Everyone, even the usually sulking Jeff Daniels, appears to be having a good time. And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have the maniacal Dennis Hopper performing opposite Keanu Reeves who is properly underplaying his role as HERO.
SPEED, I admit, is a no-brainer. But if I wanted to watch something cerebral and intellectual, there are plenty of others to choose from. I mean, from which to choose.",1089072000,,803,4.395973154362416
1345030,5,B00004RYSN,"A great film for the actions. It starts off in a lift that breaks down, then it goes onto a bus that once it reaches 50mile an hour, it can't go below that speed cos there is a bomb on the bus. Then in the end, the last 2 that are on the train find a way to get off, but they can't. Superb film even if you don't like any action films and shooting films.",1082073600,,354,3.6710526315789473
1345031,5,B00004RYSN,"Keanu Reeves is a rarity: he's a second-rate actor (at least compared to other big movie stars like Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford) who has kept his career afloat courtesy of a critically and commercially successful film every now and then. These films usually have the tendency to keep his big-screen acting career going steady for another four to five years, by which then he somehow latches on to another big hit. I hear he's going to be starring in the period epic Tripoli, so expect his career to extend to at least 2011.
Speed is one such film, his second after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but it's one of those much-hyped blockbusters that's actually worth of all the acclaim it's received and then some. Bringing together a highly unlikely cast (Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and a then unknown Sandra Bullock) and first-time director Jan De Bont, it must have spelled a recipe for disaster.
But by miracle or just pure filmmaking bravado (more the latter than the former, though if the film had been made yeseterday, I might be more inclined to agree with the former), they pulled off a great action film, one of the best ever.
After beginning with what must be one of the most intense opening credits sequences, the plot quickly gets underway. Mad bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) has just rigged explosives to drop an elevator and its apparently wealthy occupants down quite a few floors to their deaths. But his plan to extort $3.7 million is foiled by quick-thinking LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his partner (Jeff Daniels, in pretty much the thankless role that really doesn't go anywhere).
Out for revenge, Payne raises the stakes further in his ransom demands by rigging a bomb under a city bus. Once the vehicle goes over 50 mph, the bomb will be activated, and once the bus goes below 50, it'll be detonated. Traven makes a mad dash for the bus, arriving after it's already passed 50 mph, but able to keep the bus from going below. Unfortunately, the driver is shot in a mishap, leaving spunky passenger Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) to take the wheel. To make matters worse, they're in the middle of morning rush hour; staying about 50 mph will be almost an impossible task.
Speed is divided into essentially three acts and setpieces: the opening elevator sequence, the centerpiece with the bus, and finally a climactic (or post-climactic as some may see it) resolution which I won't divulge here. The bus sequence is easily the movie's highlight, quite possibly the longest action scene I've ever seen. The whole setpiece lasts just a little over fifty minutes and throws in every imaginably plausible hindrance there is to keeping a bus over 50 mph.
The stark simplicity of the premise is what fuels the film. There's probably no greater compliment I can pay the movie than to say that I can't imagine the premise being pulled off better. Every strand related to story and script is merely a means to keep the action and suspense going; I've rarely seen a film maintain such a high level of intensity and pure thrilling, crowdpleasing fun for such a lengthy period of time.
Director Jan de Bont's work here is probably among the best feature film debuts out there (only Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead comes to mind as an equally terrific debut, but was that even released in theaters in the U.S.?); he keeps the editing super-tight and the pacing frantic, but still puts the action together with crystal-clear comprehensibility. That's a fantastic accomplishment. Whatever happened to the de Bont who knew how to deliver such kinetic thrills? Each of his successive films have been progressively worse, and he's even gone as low as making a Tomb Raider sequel. Mr. de Bont, you're better than that.
The acting and dialogue are adequate enough that they don't distract from any of the action or thrills. Limited as his talent may be, Keanu Reeves is just one of those actors who I can't help but like. His performance here is still fraught with obvious moments of poor acting, but he's overall better than usual and occasionally even quite good, and he's a pretty damn easy hero to root for.
Sandra Bullock is perhaps the real standout of the picture. As feisty and sexy in a girl-next-door way as any heroine, Bullock is appealingly down to earth and entirely convincing as just a normal bystander caught in an unbelievable situation; this is as natural as acting gets. She also has damn good chemistry with Reeves, one of the vital elements missing in the sequel. Dennis Hopper is fine as the villain, this isn't really anything we haven't already seen from him in one form or another but his schtick was still amusing at the time. Cast directors must also be applauded for all (well, most of, a couple of the extras in the bus are pretty bad) the extras and character actors they used to play the bus passengers; there's a genuine sense of teamwork and solid chemistry at hand.
At no point does Speed ever crumble; its perfectly lean storytelling ensures that it never strays from the thrills on hand and it's so exciting only the biggest hard-hearted churl would try to nitpick the implausibilities. The last few minutes might seem a little excessive when one considers how exhausted we already are from all the non-stop action. That said, the third act is still very exciting, just not as inventive as the action that came before it.
Speed was inevitably followed by a sequel, which wasn't entirely unenjoyable in its own right, but misses a lot of the spark that's evident in this picture. Hell, I'd even say it needed Keanu Reeves, but by that magical Keanu rule of blockbuster hits, he wisely passed reprising the role of Traven and went on to star in The Matrix. Yup, I don't see his career extinguishing any time soon.",1079654400,,5770,4.74800796812749

1345033,3,B00004RYSN,"Ok, when I watched it in the cinemas, it was great. The action was there, the intense feeling was there (its like ""24"", only its almost 2 hours long), you grip on to your seat, you scream and shout and its like ""Keanu is so cool"" and all... and it was the complete hit for everyone. I was hook even.
But then comes the DVD Five Star Collection. Yes, the extras were there. Yes, some of the fun things about the making of the movie is there. The deleted scenes were necessary to be taken out from the movie and now you can watch it and say ""thank you for taking it out, Mr. Editor"" and most of all, the music video that isn't... well, anything exceptional.
Still, one of the most irritating features for this collection was the interactive menus. I had a hard time pressing for the selected path I want to go. Worst even I had to push the arrow button a few times to get there. And the opening of the menu... the music really gets me on my nerves.
All in all, yes I enjoyed the movie despite the flaws you can see while watching the movie. It can be part of your collection if you enjoy this movie... but then again, while watching one too many times, you might get tire of it. Still, a movie that makes Keanu looks cool... and that is before ""The Matrix"" even (which make him SUPER COOL!).",1076630400,,1289,4.180722891566265
1345034,5,B00004RYSN,"You're going to say one thing after watching ""Speed,"" and that will be ""Whoa."" This is an action film as exhausting as ""Die Hard"" and as exhilarating as the ""Terminator"" movies. It moves with the pacing of a John McTiernan picture and it has the perfection of a James Cameron action film. Its director, Jan De Bont, has worked on such films as ""Die Hard"" and ""The Hunt for Red October,"" so it's no surprise that he bears a resemblance behind the camera to McTiernan.
The film is blunt, fast-paced and extremely exciting. It stars Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven, a Los Angeles bomb squad member as cool as he is decisive. Jack has been called into duty, along with his partner and friend, Harry (Jeff Daniels), to stop a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper), who has taken control of an elevator and will drop it to the ground unless his demand of three million dollars is met.
Jack takes his chances and ends up saving the day, but not before Harry is taken hostage and survives with a bullet shot. Howard Payne (Hopper) is dead, blown to pieces by his own bomb, and so they all go have a drink and party till the moon goes down and the sun rises up. You get the idea.
But Payne didn't really die, and now he's very mad at a certain somebody who foiled his last plan. He's spent a lifetime being treated as dirt, and he has convinced himself that he deserves the $3 million more than anybody else. Jack begs to differ, but he has no time to argue when Payne reappears and triggers a downtown bus with a bomb. The catch? If the bus accelerates past 50 M.P.H. and then drops below that point as before...kaboom.
Jack manages to board the bus, but not before it reaches 50, and not before the bus driver gets shot by a criminal on the bus and Annie (Sandra Bullock) has to play driver for the rest of the day. The problem is, downtown LA during rush hour is not exactly open to a large bus, so with the help of the LAPD, the bus is driven to a deserted stretch of highway, where they have a limited amount of time to either disarm the bus or pay up the sum of money to Payne.
Meanwhile, Howard Payne is monitoring everything from his position in an apartment in LA, where he has a gadget wired up to the security camera in the bus, so that he can watch everything that's happening. If anyone tries to get off the bus, or if anyone tries to be a hero, he presses a little red button and.kaboom. Only this time, he's determined not to fail.
This is a ludicrously and ridiculously delicious plot. I'm surprised it hasn't been done already. Well, actually, it sorta has. Yes, this film bears an uncanny resemblance to ""Die Hard,"" only on a bus, but you know what? It's just about as good. It's exciting, humorous, and absolutely fun from start to finish. It never stops to go into boring conversations back at the FBI headquarters that so many action films do to try and make them look smarter. It never lets up for a moment once it starts.
All good action films have comedic relief, and ""Speed"" - apart from occasional witty remarks between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves and/or Dennis Hopper - has Alan Ruck and Jeff Daniels. You may remember Ruck as Cameron Frye in John Hughes' ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), and you may remember him from the television show ""Spin City,"" and here he plays a tourist who isn't really able to understand the situation they're in on the bus. ""The airport?"" he says as the bus swerves down a runway. ""I've already been here.""
Daniels is one of cinema's great character actors with dry subtle humor. He can do dramatics (""Gettysburg""), he can do comedy (""Dumb and Dumber""), and he can now do action. It takes an odd sort of acting genius to subtly upstage Jim Carrey, but he did just that in ""Dumb and Dumber"" by making a subtle goofball out of his character, Harry Dunne. Here he does the same with the sort of bleak sarcastic quips he was born to say.
Jan De Bont knows how to film action. Just when you think everything's going to slow down after the bus finally stops, we realize it's just the beginning. Payne kidnaps Annie, takes her to a subway train, and tries to run away with her to lure Jack. It works. And in the climatic gripper, Jack and Payne fight on the top of a speeding subway train. It was done in ""Mission: Impossible"" a small number of years later, but this came first. And the film is better.
Can Keanu Reeves act? Hardly. He does his usual ""Whoa"" routine here, where his lines primarily consist of long pauses and, ""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Whoa,"" ""Wow,"" ""F--k me,"" ""Bogus,"" and so on. But an action film doesn't need a good actor, and Reeves fits the part. It was his breakthrough action role - without it, he never would have appeared in ""The Matrix.""
""Speed"" is one of the great action films. It bears similarities to ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""The Terminator"" (1 and 2), ""Predator,"" and all those other hard-punching action films with a fast pace and a real kick (it doesn't bear resemblance to all of the films as much as the raw force behind them). You know the kind of hard action flicks I mean - the kind that make you feel beaten up by the time it's all over. The kinds that make you leave the theater bruised and swollen.

1345037,5,B00004RYSN,"Perhaps one of the most terrifying adrenaline-rushing movies ever made 1994's ""Speed"" is a terrifying but absolutely original movie with a very original plot.
Set in the traffic-congested streets of L.A., the beginnings of the attacks begin when a metro bus is blown up just as it makes its stop at a bus stop. Also, an elevator has its cables severed after a bomb that was planted explodes sending the elevator and numerous passengers in it plummeting over 50 floors down but is stopped temporarily but in only a matter of time, the elevator will crash to the bottom floor and can they rescue those on board before it's too late?
However, that is just the tip of the iceberg as two disgruntled cops, are on a hunt to bring down the reign of terror from a retired police officer turned terrorist Howard Payne, and save numerous passengers stuck on a bus with a powerful bomb planted that will explode when the speedometer goes below 50 miles per hour plus the passengers are held hostage as the escape routes are rigged with explosives that'll go off when any passenger attempts to escape through the exits!! Now the two disgruntled cops, with a large task force assembled, go on an extremely dangerous and highly adrenaline-rushing mission to rescue the passengers on the bus WITHOUT causing it to go below 50 miles per hour and also to stop Payne's terrorist activities.
The title of this movie is just downright perfect for what the movie really is. It's one very long extremely suspenseful ride along a terrifying visual assault, seeing the bus go over a 50 foot wide gap on an unfinished freeway, and through opposing traffic, I've never seen a movie like this that has so much action yet relatively little of the human to human kind of action, little fist fighting, guns shooting, etc. and for that this movie stands out among the numerous action movies of modern times, being a type of action movie that relies more on long suspenseful sequence rather than just a whole bunch of numerous human to human combat, gunfights, yada yada yada.....
Whoever came up with this clever movie plot was a total genius. Sad to see a great movie legacy be watered down with the lousy follow-up sequel ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", which had little of the adrenaline and a far slower paced plot than this one. Even Sandra Bullock, who was excellent in this one, seemed like she was ready to leave the set with ""Cruise Control"" as soon as possible. On ""Speed"" though, she was just awesome, showing the sheer terror of Annie's experience on the bus as she tries to keep it from going below 50 mph.
Keanu Reeves may be having another glory era in his career with the Matrix movies right now but for me, ""Speed"" is Reeves' best acting performance of his career to date.

1345039,5,B00004RYSN,"""Speed"" is, by far, one of the best action thrillers I have ever seen. It's use of thrills, suspense, humor, and romance makes this the perfect all-around movie.
The film revolves around Jack (Keanu Reeves), a member of the S.W.A.T. team, who gets involved with a madman bomber whom he thought had died years earlier when one of his bomb attacks went bad - an excellent suspenseful elevator scene by the way. The bomber, played hauntingly well by Dennis Hopper, has placed a bomb on a bus in the middle of Los Angeles. If that weren't bad enough, if the bus drops below 50 mph, the bomb will explode. It is up to Jack, with the help of Annie (Sandra Bullock), to bring all of the passengers to safety and stop the madman.
This is one film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you wanting more.

1345042,5,B00004RYSN,"Director Jan de Bont (who crafted the brilliant cinematography for the original Die Hard) helmed this 1994 smash hit that, like Die Hard, would set the standard for hundreds of following action films, and, also like Die Hard, made a superstar out of it's lead, Keanu Reeves.  Reeves plays an L.A. cop who gets in the path of a crazed bomber with an agenda (Dennis Hopper in psycho mode), and eventually winds up on a rigged bus that will explode if it falls below 50 MPH.  The frentic action is carried at a speedy (no pun intended) pace, and Reeves carries the film on his shoulders, while Hopper gives a great performance as well and you can tell that this guy is in his element with his role.  Speed also features the star making performance of Sandra Bullock as a pivotal bus passenger, and we also get smaller, but nonetheless important, roles from Jeff Daniels, Joe Morton, and Glenn Plummer.  Naturally, since Speed was such a sucess, a sequel was released (Reeves wisely elected not to star in it because ""he didn't want to get typecast as an action star"", yet this is the guy in the bankable Matrix trilogy, go figure, maybe he got an advance of the sequel's script) with Jan de Bont at the helm, but didn't carry an ounce of the magic that this action classic does.  20th Century Fox has done another fantastic job with this Five Star Collection DVD; it's packed with extras including an insightful commentary from de Bont and it even has the rarely seen Billy Idol music video for the film's theme song.

I'd put this film ahead of even ""Die Hard"" because this film has something which DH doesn't have; an appeal to both sexes. DH was a man's film. John McClane had only a wife so that negated any opportunity for romance.

Jack (Keanu Reeves) is the superlative dare-devil hero; fearless and bold, strong and muscular, kind and gentle, highly intelligent and ready to lay down his life in the fight against evil and to save Annie (Sandra Bullock) the lovely  young woman he has come to love. And his love is returned. How could  it not be when they have shared such danger together and he, with all the attributes of a story book hero, has proved his worth many times over? And she only a frightened young girl looking to him for protection  and salvation. He is a  woman's dream; a knight on a white charger. And she is a man's dream; an intelligent, spirited, and brave woman, but one who is frightened and dependant and in need of protection.
The heart-rending way he stays with her near the end to face almost  certain death, when he could so easily have saved himself and left her alone to die, proved his commitment and love. I don't know which I  admired most in this film; the non-stop action and dramatic tension, or  the  tender love story. What a combination! No wonder the film did so  well at the box office.",1041379200,,1851,4.601823708206687
1345046,3,B00004RYSN,"Whoever at Fox Home Video organized this DVD set forgot to put the DTS digital soundtrack on.  I knew something was wrong when I didn't see the DTS trailer at the beginning of the movie.  Please FOX, go back and put DTS back on Speed.",1037664000,,234,4.177777777777778
1345047,5,B00004RYSN,"Speed is one of those movies that has such a stupid premise its fun to watch, and many people do, myself included, over and over and over again until we are sick of it, and then we give it one more round. The film stars Keanu ""Whoa!"" Reeves as a LA police officer who boards a bus with a bomb armed below it. Go above 50 the bomb is armed, go below 50, Kaboom! Sandra Bullock stars alongside crazed bomber Dennis Hopper as a chick who got on the wrong bus this morning.
What really drives this movie along is the relentless action that director Jan DeBont seems to throw at the audience like it's candy. Coming off of one obstacle leads to another more challenging problem. Nearly all the time you would be board of ""Not Again..."" syndrome, but the movie keeps everything fresh and good and keeps you entertained for it's two-hour running time.
Speed was giving an initial release on DVD (along with it's god-awful sequel) back when the format was still young, while every studio has to double dip, FOX takes the cake with their excellent 5-Star Editions of classic action movies like Independence Day, Die Hard, and The Abyss. So here we are with Speed being given the ultimate treatment and you couldn't have a better result.
Video
For being a movie made in the mid 1990s the picture quality is right on and the color definition is excellent, especially during the explosions in the beginning with the first bus and the cargo plane at the end. Blacks, although not present that much, unlike Resident Evil, are deep when they can be seen on screen. I didn't notice any edge enhancement of the print, but then again I was to busy watching the movie. There are still a few artifacts here and there, but for the most part video quality is excellent and is right up there with Die Hard and ID4 for superior quality with the 5-Star name.
Sound
One word: Excellent. I love FOX for including the DTS soundtrack with it's ample use of your subwoofer. Your neighbors will be either pissed, or begging to join your party. I know I am a sucker for DTS, but man, this is an excellent track. While I still like the sound in Black Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines better, Speed's soundtrack is excellent. I do with that voices were a bit higher defined in the center channel, but with all the sound effects and explosions everywhere you won't be listen that hard to see where people are talking from. The THX optimization only adds to an already great sounding track. The disc also provides a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for those of you without the pleasure of DTS.
Extras
As with all of FOX's 5-Star DVD's the entire second disc of the two disc set is loaded with special features. You can see the full listing below, but there is some really cool stuff on this disc. You get some extended scenes, stunt break-down, an eight camera shot of the final bus vs. cargo plane sequence. You get music videos, and HBO special, screen play, trailer, and TV spots, not to mention interviews with the cast. A wealth of material and a worthy addition to the series.
Summation
Speed was a great movie when it was released on a bare-bones DVD, and it becomes an excellent movie with one of the best discs I have in my vast collection of DVDs. This is a great disc and if you are second guessing the position to buy it, don't, this is a great movie, pick this disc up now.",1037145600,,3342,4.444625407166124
1345048,1,B00004RYSN,This movie is filled with action but is totally unrealistic!  The movie should actually be considered a comedy because of the stuff that goes on.  I wouldn't reccomend it.,1036972800,,171,4.862068965517241
1345049,4,B00004RYSN,"Step aside, ma'am, Jack Traven is boarding the bus! But unlike the other passangers, he's boarding ths bus by jumping from a speeding Jaguar, so obviously the passengers already on board believe the guy ""is out of his mind"". He's not, actually. He's doing that because the bus simply can't slow down. It has to stay over 50 mph or a bomb planted under it will go off, a bomb planted by an angry ex-police officer and the explosive is capable of evaporating a city block. Put this bus in the streets of urban Los Angeles and those passengers have a problem! But boy, we're in for an adrenaline rush!
Jan De Bont's directorial debut is a very well-told urban tale about revenge and the music by Mark Mancina (Disney's Tarzan, Con Air) and the cinematography of Andrzej Bartkowiak (Falling Down, Lethal Weapon 4) help this movie to have a very urbane look. Tall buildings, gridlock traffic, golden sunlight, the sense of city heat and the gray-layer of air pollution as the bus makes its way through the streets of L.A.
Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is a former cop, who feels humiliated by his retirement plan, after protecting the citizens of Los Angeles for decades. So he sets up a plan to put innocent people in danger and ask for ransom, but that's when SWAT officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) enters the plot, as the guy who saves those hostages and almost kills Payne. But Payne isn't dead, not by a long shot. Now even more angry and with nothing to lose, he elaborates a new plan, which consists on planting a bomb on a city bus. The bomb will activate itself if the bus goes over 50 mph, and once over that speed, it can never slow down or it will blow up. So Jack Traven and a couple of his friends (Dumb & Dumber's Jeff Daniels and Terminator 2's Joe Morton) and a unwilling civilian partner (Strange Days' Glenn Plummer) start a race to foil this new plan and taking Payne out for good. But it's going to be a long, urbane, working-day morning before they can call it a day. With a bus filled with likable characters (Alan Ruck, Sandra Bullock, Beth Grant, Hawthorne James, Carlos Carrasco, David Kriegel, Daniel Villarreal, et al) you really get to care about them and with the right sensibility, you even get to worry about any possible problem they might face, but don't worry, with a little luck, Jack might just as well save the day.
The 5-star collection edition is a perfect opportunity to enjoy this 1994 film in all its greatness, featuring some really fun TV spots, the theatrical trailer, interviews, deleted and extended scenes (great ones, actually) and even a Billy Idol music video, among lots of other things enough to fill a city bus... pun intended, of course. This movie was followed by a weird 1997 sequel (no Keanu Reeves) but that's another story. That sequel is not near as good as this movie here and is this one the one you should check out if you're interested in having a good time, that is of course, if action is your thing.",1035072000,,2963,4.54018691588785

(USA - 1994)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS

That rarity in modern American cinema - a high concept bubblegum movie which lives up to its own hype and doesn't insult the audience's intelligence - the film offers a three-act scenario (elevator, bus and subway) in which a ruthless terrorist (Dennis Hopper) pits his considerable bomb-making skills against the local SWAT team's finest agents, led by a pumped-up Keanu Reeves (whose career was subsequently launched into orbit, reaching iconic status in the ultra-popular MATRIX series). In one of the commentaries provided for the DVD version, producer Mark Gordon (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and writer Graham Yost (BROKEN ARROW) cheerfully acknowledge the film's one-dimensional characters and obvious plot-holes whilst celebrating the ultra-slick production values and breathtaking action sequences.

And it IS slick: Debut director Jan de Bont (an erstwhile cinematographer, usually associated with Paul Verhoeven) has marshalled a note-perfect creative team on both sides of the camera, turning Yost's modest screenplay into a super-charged thrill-machine, photographed (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) and edited (by John Wright) to perfection, and augmented by some of the best stuntwork and visual effects that money can buy. The cast is dependable and solid: Reeves and Hopper make a formidable virtue of their opposing characters, and leading lady Sandra Bullock 'makes cute' in a career-making performance, while Jeff Daniels (DUMB & DUMBER) and Joe Morton (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) offer strong support in crucial secondary roles.

NB. To date, no one involved in the production has addressed the narrative parallels between SPEED and the Japanese thriller THE BULLET TRAIN (1975), in which a terrorist bomb is primed to explode on board a packed commuter train if it falls below a certain speed. It's possible that SPEED was written and produced in complete ignorance of the earlier film, but the two scenarios share uncomfortable similarities.",1033344000,,2054,5.591639871382637
1345052,5,B00004RYSN,"This is a fun movie, and one of the most entertaining movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The plot is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity: a bunch of innocent people, plus a cop, are on a bus. A terrorist has put a bomb on the bus, so if the bus slows down everyone blows up and dies. And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride. That's all you have to do with this movie.",1032480000,,868,4.234939759036145
1345053,5,B00004RYSN,"SPEED is a fun movie with a lot of action, explosions, action, humor, car crashed, action, suspense and did I mention action? Screen directorial debut of renowned cinematographer Jan De Bont. (Twister, The Haunting, Tomb Raider 2) He did a fantastic job with camera, action capturing and keeping the camera always moving.
The story is very interesting and some incredibly believable performances. Keanu Reeves ( Chain Reaction, The Matrix 1 & 2) and Jeff Daniels (My Favorite Martian, Terms Of Endearment, 101 Dalmations ) play two SWAT officers assigned to rescue several people trapped in a high-rise elevator by a disgruntled ex-police office brilliantly played by Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Rumblefish, Hoosiers ). His plan fails and as a result Dennis gets really made and seeks revenge. Enter innocent Sandra Bullock as a regular gal thrown into a situation that makes her character stronger and extremely likeable. Enter the bus, a regular MTA bus that becomes the `real' star of the movie.
Keanu and Sandra have some great chemistry going and the action that this bus goes through is non-stop. Everything that is thrown at them is figured out rationally and then something totally believable is thrown at them again. AlanRuck (Star Trek: Generations, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Young Guns II ) gives a great performance as an out-of-towner who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
The DVD extras are great. Several interview sequences with the cast and the director as well as several technical featurettes that explain the 12 busses needed to make this film. There is a music video, trailers, promos, scripts and artwork and storyboards. This film is very technically clear and educational for the novice who really doesn't know much about stunts and filmmaking.
This is a great DVD collection and series and with the commentary Jan De Bont is very enlightening as well. As far as action films this is a good film to have in your collection. `Speed' this one home. (9-9-02)",1031788800,,1996,4.996996996996997
1345054,5,B00004RYSN,"Part of the reason ""Speed"" works so well is the way we care for the characters on the runaway bus. They were innocent people going to work and making a living like most everyone else on the planet. We sympathize with them. But that's only part of the reason. The biggest reason is the non-stop thrills and chills that erupt from this Jan De Bont vehicle starring Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper. One of the greatest action flicks in the past decade, ""Speed"" thrusts its audience into a roller-coaster ride filled with explosions, goodguy-badguy banter, humor, and doesn't stop until the action does, never stopping for air, even after the villain faces his demise. It's a superior action flick.",1031270400,,693,4.831932773109243

1345056,3,B00004RYSN,"Speed, directed by Jan De Bont and starring Keanu Reeves, is indeed entertaining though I wouldn't put it in the category of action.  I believe that an ""action movie"" must have:
1.  A lot of gunplay
2.  Some explosions
3.  Fist fights
Speed does have some explosions though hardly any gunplay or fist fights.  It's more of a thriller than an action film.  Keanu Reeves plays Jack Travin, a cop.  He is always fighting his arch-nemesis Howard Payne (played by Dennis Hopper).  In the first fifteen minutes of the movie Travin and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels, My Favorite Martian) stop an elevator from crashing and save everyone onboard.  Payne, who had devised this plan, is mad so he wants to get back at Travin.  So he plants a bomb on a bus, stating that if the bus goes under 50 miles an hour it'll explode and kill everyone onboard.  Travin gets onto the bus and tries thinking of ways to stop the bomb but unfortunately some passengers get into a fight and the driver is killed.  A passenger (Sandra Bullock, Demolition Man) takes over and now they must keep the bus at 50 m.p.h or else it'll be the last day of their lives.  This movie is very entertaining though a bit predictable and for more suspense, I recomnend the second one, Speed 2: Cruise Control.  I enjoyed this movie though I though it was a bit too long.  3 stars.",1030579200,,1339,4.475206611570248
1345057,4,B00004RYSN,"""Speed"" looks and feels like it could have been made in the '00s. The 1994 action film has lost none of its velocity. Fox has released Jan De Bont's thriller as part of its high-end Five Star Collection, updated to THX standards. The widescreen images look suitably flashy -- a bit flat in some outdoors shots, but with few signs of age. DTS delivers the audio remix to maximum effect, rear speakers frantically pumping out breaking glass and screeching metal. The Dolby Digital (5.1) track sounds edgy as well, but without DTS' sonic depth.
The soft-spoken director De Bont uses the commentary to outline his philosphy of acting for action films, saying that subtle performances just look dumb in frantic movies. A lot of actors are afraid of the perils of action filming, he says. Producer Mark Gordon and writer Graham Yost pack their high-energy, off-the-wall commentary with information. ""Speed"" would never be green-lit now, they say: ""Nobody wants to see a plane blown up.""
""Speed's"" second disc includes an unusually detailed featurette on stunt coordinator Gary Hymes. He shows admiration for the ""very physical"" hero Keanau Reeves, who ""wanted to do almost everything himself,"" including a leap onto the moving bus. Hymes talks about his craft at length, saying he likes to work with a stuntman ""who has a good healthy sense of fear.""
A visual effects segment breaks down the bus jump sequence (look for the digital birds) and the film's final subway crash, mostly done with models. Multiangle, multicamera views put you in the driver's seat; that's good for an hour or so of DVD remote button pushing.
You can buy this in a set with ""Speed 2,"" but that's a worthless movie. The filmmakers go out of their way to disown it on the ""Speed"" commentaries.",1029801600,,1761,4.873333333333333

Forget about the plausibility of the plot, since if that were the standard to judge action/adventure movies, how many would qualify? Instead, enjoy the non-stop excitement, with ""Armaggedon""-type pacing where each solution is followed by another problem.
The movie is basically all-action, all the time, and that's what those of us who love this genre want.  If you're looking for profound dialogue or character development, you won't find it, but you will find lots of humor thrown in to lighten things up.
Keanu Reeves gives a glimpse of the sort of intensity that he would bring to the ""Matrix"", and Bullock is about as believable as anyone could be behind the wheel of the bus. The two of them establish a good chemistry and this definitely lifts the film above the run-of-the-mill.
Dennis Hopper is his usual maniacal self as the crazed villain, and Jeff Daniels does a credible job as Reeves' partner; the two of them had some great lines at the beginning of the film.
The DVD transfer is excellent;  the video is clear and well-balanced with minimal digital artifacts, and the audio will give your surround system a real workout.  I haven't looked at the second disc yet but it's loaded with extras.

1345063,5,B00004RYSN,"This film is extremely well-constructed and enjoyable.  Jan De Bont smartly realized that an action film is only as good as the characters that embody it.  Even though the basic premise, a bus needs to stay above 50 MPH otherwise it explodes, is intriguing, the smart characters make the implausible action sequences believable.  Everybody likes Sandra Bullock's spot-on reactions and emotions, and Dennis Hopper's manic but not over-the-top villain.  However, even better are the extras on the bus itself.  We see subtle acting by people with which we identify.  There are no goofy one-liners that seem scripted.
The movie begins with 11 elevator passengers stuck towards the top of a high-rise.  Keanu Reeves (one of his best roles) and Jeff Daniels are S.W.A.T. team cops assigned to remove the passengers before Dennis Hopper blows the emergency brakes.  Exciting stuff.  The movie then proceeds with the bus story.
Jan De Bont graduated into directing with this film, having spent most of his career up until then as a cinematographer (Die Hard, Basic Instinct).  After Twister and Speed 2: Cruise Control, it seems he has graduated again into producing (most recently Spielberg's Minority Report).  He clearly has a gift for action sequences, and let's hope he has the chance to show off his chops again soon - at the wheel.",1027987200,,1330,5.055045871559633

We like to see Dennis in this type of role; we expect it, and thus are not disappointed. The supporting cast is good. Reeves and Bullock, around whom the subplot of a developing love relationship centers, probably do as well as they can with their lines. Bullock seems more at ease. Reeves seems a bit wooden.

1345068,5,B00004RYSN,"This is the film that made Keanu Reeves a bankable action film star. Of course, it was overdue anyway, based on his stellar performance in Point Break a few years before, but this was the one that lit him up like a Christmas tree on the pantheon of Hollywood somebodies. The plot is simple yet imaginative; an ex-cop demolition expert with a grudge decides to put a busful of hostages at risk by rigging it to explode if its speed goes below 50 miles an hour. So place these people (including a reluctant Sanda Bullock as the drafted designated bus driver), add Keanu as the cop trying to keep the busful of civilians straight and catch the bad guy (played well by Dennis Hopper)and Jeff Daniels playing the other cop trying to figure out the demolition angle from back at the station, and you have all the ingredients for a terrific and very entertaining movie.
Which, of course, it is. It is unusual, very well acted, and the action sequences simply steal the movie. There is very little down time in the movie, and like the early Jaws, one finds oneself reeling from the action as it goes literally from one situation to another. The way the action scenes are choreographed and plotted makes one want to run for cover as the bus screams through a bevy of hairy circumstances one would think are going to doom it and the passengers to a fiery death.

I think it was called: The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down!"" Even Homer realises the cleverness of Jan De Bont's tautly-directed action thriller.
Starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, Speed is one of those rare films that comes along every now and then that proves to be better than standard fare. Essentially one big extended action scene, the film's frenetic pace makes up for the frequent plot holes. The action never lets up, creating suspense- filled set-pieces and audience excitement. The premise of a bomb on a bus that wil explode if the speed goes below 50 makes for one far-fetched but fun thrill ride.
Keanu is the quintessential gum-chewing cool guy action hero Jack Traven who, along with Annie Porter (Bullock) tries not to get blown up by a bomb that retired cop Howard Payne (Hopper) has set on the bus to get money.

1345072,5,B00004RYSN,"One of the most highly charged action films since Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the 1994 film SPEED is a model for how action films with fairly realistic situations should be done.  Long-time cinematographer Jan DeBont (DIE HARD; THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER) got behind the director's chair for this hair-raising suspense thriller that has a high-tech look and a familiar flair to it.
Keanu Reeves is the L.A. police officer out to stop a deranged former Atlanta cop (Dennis Hopper) from detonating a bomb on a bus going from Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles.  Earlier, Reeves and his partner (Jeff Daniels) had stopped Hopper from killing people in an express elevator in a highrise and collecting on a $3 million ransom.
Now, Hopper has raised the stakes even further.  He has demanded $3.7 million.  Even worse, he has made his bomb so that it will blow the bus up if its speed drops under fifty miles per hour.  With the way L.A.'s freeways work, this will not prove easy.  And when the bus driver is shot by a frightened passenger, another passenger, Annie (Sandra Bullock) is forced to take the wheel and keep the bus moving.  The result is a series of hair-raising turns, twists, and edge-of-the-seat suspense that climaxes at LAX.
The fun doesn't end there, however.  Hopper kidnaps Bullock off the street near Pershing Square in Downtown L.A., and Reeves tracks him onto a Metrorail subway train.  He finally does away with Hopper; but with the train's brake system disabled, he and Bullock must survive the train jumping the tracks along Hollywood Boulevard.
Winner of two Oscars, for Sound and Sound Effects Editing, SPEED is genuinely solid suspense and action, two hours worth of bang for the buck.  But aside from being all that, it is also entertaining, with a fairly believable plot outline, and some truly jaw-dropping scenes, including the bus having to navigate its way over a fifty foot gap in the still-uncompleted Century Freeway.  Reeves and Bullock make for an appealing pair who manage to fall in love somehow during this crazy ordeal.  And although this is a role that he could have done in his sleep (so could Jack Nicholson or Bruce Dern), Hopper is a plenty nasty villain who shows nothing but contempt for Reeves, Bullock, the police, and the bus passengers.
A lot of action films are all about explosions, profanity, violence, blood, and guts.  SPEED has some of that, but it is also a well-crafted film, with elements of DIE HARD, Spielberg's DUEL, and the 1974 classic THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE to liven things up.  It is a sure-fire winner.",1025568000,,2591,4.81941309255079

After breaking his plans and saving the day the villain set a bomb on a LA Metropolitan bus full of citizens which will explode after passing 50 mph and it can be lowered or else will explode also.
Jack gets in there and after a struggle where the bus driver is being hit Annie(Bullock) takes the wheel and starts taking the bus outside the area after jumping an high and impossible jump of 50 meters on a broke road bridge they get to Lax where they cheated the  villain and saved all the hostages but after a unsucessful trip to the villains home he wants to be paid but he escapes to the subway with one hostage.

The movie gets complicated when the madman bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has installed a bomb that will go off if the bus doesn't surpass 50 m.p.h. if his demands aren't met within a couple of hours.
The movie is superb-in it's cinematography and sound editing (which it rightfully snatched an Oscar for the sound editing), superb dialogue, fine score, and the utter simplicity of the plot that leads to a satisfying suspense finale in a runaway subway.

1345084,4,B00004RYSN,"In many ways 'Speed' was a surprise hit.  The director wasn't big-league, the leads were relative unknowns and it was original, something that unfortunately can mean the kiss of death for several good movies out there.  Basically, this is an absolutely gob-smacking movie that will grip you from the very beginning.  The central plot revolves around a bomb on a bus that will blow if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour.  Jack (Reeves) is the cop on the bus that has to work a way out of the situation before the bus runs out of petrol, whilst partner Jeff Daniels is on the trail of Dennis Hopper's terrorist.  On the bus is feisty passenger Sandra Bullock, who gets behind the wheel after something happens to the driver.
The movie manages to grab hold of its audience's attention from the beginning with a scene involving a lift full of passengers that it just about to go careening to the bottom floor.  Yet it's the story with the bus that is truly a masterstroke in holding the viewer.  We feel the heightened panic alongside the bus passengers and scream, cover our eyes and jump when they do.  The winning script was almost completely written by an (uncredited) Joss Whedon, who proves that his excellence expands beyond 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'.
In addition to this, 'Speed' is held together with an absolutely stellar performance from Sandra Bullock as panicky Annie.  She manages to keep the audience alongside her whilst perfectly pulling off her act as an ordinary person stuck in a nightmarish situation.  Also, Keanu Reeves is backed up by this and his bland depiction of the hero fades into the background.  Although the movie does tend to go a little bit too far towards the end, there's no denying that it's a powerfully gripping movie that is well worth seeing.",1012953600,,1783,4.719354838709678

I find him very cool and sexy, chewing gum on a bomb disposal job (BTW, do SWAT officers really do that?!), wearing a Casio G-Shock digital watch (can see it close-up when he looked at the time), and sporting that s-h-o-r-t haircut - he is very charming and cute. Keanu looked good in Matrix, but even better in Speed..And who says he is always  deadpan? When his characters are angry, sad, or happy, he projects it enough for me to know that that's his feeling. To me, real deadpan is...Terminator-like. But even then, the ""deadpan"" look is what makes his good looks look cool, man.
The only thing I find incredible is that by and large, the passengers on the bus were too calm and composed, even after knowing that the bus had a bomb, the 50-mph thing, and gas is running out. I would have expected more anxiety or apprehension among them. But, who cares? Another point is that I find that a certain vulgarity is uttered too often, not only by the villain, but (gasp!) even by the good guys, including, sob! sob! Keanu Reeves.

1345106,5,B00004RYSN,"The 1990's were certainly filled with many interesting and hard hitting action films, but the summer of 1994 provided the decade with it's most sensational example of a film that could be witty, well executed, action  packed, and brillant in concept. The film that I am talking about needs no  introduction. Dealing with bombed elevators, sympathetic hostages that  behave with authentic behaviors, a deranged Dennis Hooper, sabotaged  subways, police officers shooting terrorists' hostages, and a rigged Los  Angeles bus that will explode if it slows to less than 50 miles per hour.  Speed depicts the spine-tingling trials and tribulations of LAPD police  office Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) as he combats ex-police office/super  terrorist Howard Paine (Dennis Hooper) who will do anything to get his 3  million dollar pension fund. Beyond the typical action plot, Speed excelled  as movie mainly because it took a gamble that the audience would respond  better to real characters acting human in impossible situations as opposed  to inhuman characters that are immune to the stress and anxiety of the  film's improbable events. At one point in the film's story, the Reeve's  character emotionally breaks down and seriously gives up hope of survival.  The film's mutiple disaster sub-plots offer a breathlessly breakneck pace  that propels the viewer forward with uncontrollable exuberance and  high-octane enthusiasm. The film's set pieces though far-fetched are never  beyond any realistic suspension of disbelief, and Speed's screenplay  supplies ample amounts of inspired comic relief and black humor to off-set  the film's consistant bombardment of heavy thrills and chills. Undeniably  one heck of roller coaster ride, Speed is tribute to an unbelievably  impressive directorial debut by cinematographer Jan De Bont. Excellent DVD  package that has relatively few features but is definte must-buy for any  action fan.",959644800,,1923,5.506849315068493
1345107,5,B00004RYSN,"'Speed' is a great movide - it effectively launched Keanu Reeves' action career and paved the way for roles such as Neo in the Matrix.  As such, our drawling newly-short-haired hero eschews complex dialogue and instead  dashes around trying to save Sandra Bullock and assorted innocent  bystanders from the terrorism inflicted upon their city by Dennis Hopper.  The centrepiece of the film is the excellent  bus-that-will-explode-if-it-slows-down scenario, but there are a number of  other cool set-pieces too, involving trains, elevators, bombs and much  accompanying smoke and sparks.  The sequel (without Mr Reeves) wasn't  really up to much by comparison, but this original film by Jan de Bont is a  prime example of successful rollercoaster cinema.",959040000,,753,5.469565217391304
1345108,4,B00004RYSN,"""Die Hard"" was the prototype for the 90s action film and ""Speed"" remains one of the best reworkings of it.  It delivers enough non-stop action and thrills to satisfy even the most-demanding  action fans.
Keanu Reeves (who'd have believed it before ""The  Matrix""?) stars as Jack Traven, LAPD SWAT commando.  Traven and his  partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) battle one-thumbed mad bomber Howard Payne  (Dennis Hopper) throughout nearly two hours of wall-to-wall testosterone  and mayhem.
The script by virgin screenwriter Graham Yost delivers not  one, but three thrilling disaster stories, accomplishing that rare  Hollywood miracle of actually giving the audience more than they  expected.
Reeves gives a surprisingly good performance, showing  uncharacteristic confidence and ease.  Daniels is largely wasted and Hopper  gives his stock crazed villain performance--and once again I loved it.  The  always delightful Sandra Bullock, co-starring as Reeve's love interest, is  excellent, giving just the right touch to her scenes.
""Speed""  was a remarkable directorial debut for veteran cinematographer Jan De Bont.  He obviously learned a great deal while lensing pictures for Paul  Verhoeven (""Basic Instinct"") and John McTiernan (""The Hunt  for Red October."")  The action sequences and stunts in this film are  as good as any you'll see.  This is one movie that really delivers.",958953600,,1375,5.536231884057971
1345109,5,B00004RYSN,"""Speed"" in my opinion ranks as one of the best action movies of all time. It has a clever plot, excellent pacing, great direction. This film is a non stop ride, it never slows down. Most of the other reviews for  this movie are correct so there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been  said already.",958435200,,302,4.189655172413793
1345110,5,B00004RYSN,"At the amusement park, do you like the roller coaster or the merry-go-round? If your answer is roller coaster, keep reading.  Oh, one more thing. Do you have a heart condition? No? Oh, good! Well, you have  passed the test-- you should definitely love Speed.  So hurry up and go buy  it!
This movie is very ENTERTAINING and STIMULATING.  You will lean  forward in your seat and you may notice your hands clench and your muscles  tense up with anticipation. Not many movies are so exciting that they  achieve a physical response from the audience like this!  Another reason  you might feel this way could be due to the incredibly sexy actors, Keanu  Reeves and Sandra Bullock.  Together they have great chemistry on the  screen and make a super duo.  A note to Keanu fans, he is at his sexiest in  this movie and that smile will knock you out flat! (Also Dennis Hopper gets  my vote as a great reprobative villain. Furthermore, Jeff Daniels plays  Keanu's mentor wonderfully, they are very believable as best  friends.)
Speed makes a great date movie, party movie, or just anytime  you need a wakeup call. Speed says to me, 'Live life to the fullest and  find your passion!'
YOU WON'T FIND MORE ACTION THAN THIS ANYWHERE!  THIS  IS THE KING OF ACTION MOVIES! (However, Point Break is a great action movie  to see also if you haven't already.)",956966400,,1341,4.6127659574468085

This is one of the best action movies of recent times, it really satisfies if you're  looking for a non-stop adrenaline rush.

1345117,5,B00004RYSN,"Speed is a breakneck, thrill-a-minute ride. Every time you think it's over, something else happens! This is a fantastic movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last minute. Keanu Reeves gives a  riveting performance as L.A cop Jack Traven, especially when he pounds on  the window of the bus and breaks it while trying to warn the driver about  the bomb. I loved Sandra Bullock saying 'Don't let him on!'. The scene at  the subway is terrific too. Go Jack! You will bite your nails for this one,  I promise.",940204800,,527,4.447916666666667
1345118,4,B00004RYSN,"I think Dennis Hopper did a superb supporting role as the psycho villain in the movie, Speed.  His thirst for vengeance in exchange for cold cash was well put together.  Hopper carries the whole lead in this movie.  Although smart and lethal Hopper seems to be, Keanu Reeves, with his  heartthrobbing good looks, makes his move to stop the wise and  temperemental Hopper.  The movie takes you around the greater LA area--the  freeways, boulevards and to LAX, which are fun to watch. The movie stunts  evolving the speeding bus are shocking with disbelief throughout.  Lastly,  Sandra Bullock is just another cute face in the movie with her ""help  me, rescue me"" role.",926985600,,667,4.866071428571429
1345119,5,B00004RYSN,"From the opening scene to the very last, this movie grabs you and takes you on a tremendous ride of action and suspense.  There is romance and more than a hint of humor -- and Dennis Hopper is EXCELLENT as the  ""villian""!  This is the same Keenu Reeves that was in ""Bill  and Ted's Excellent Adventure""?  Boy has he MATURED (and bulked up as  well)!  And Sandra Bullock makes the character of ""Annie"" so very  real.  This is an absolute ""MUST SEE""!",925516800,,448,4.365853658536586
