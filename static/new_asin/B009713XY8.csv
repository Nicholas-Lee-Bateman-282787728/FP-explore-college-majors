Excellent documentary, fantastic show.",1529539200,,370,4.707692307692308

8537125,5,B009713XY8,"If you are a Saxon fan, don't hesitate to buy this video. A lot of contents and the interviews with the band members are very interesting.",1369958400,,138,4.346153846153846
8537126,4,B009713XY8,"I have a copy of the 2 dvd set called Armageddon Over Wacken 2003 (no comments on that webpage so that's why I'm writing here) where the bass player for the band Saxon that night looks to me like the guy that produced and made the movie about Heavy Metal called Metal: A Headbangers Journey is that the same guy?

Just Wondering.

8537127,4,B009713XY8,"As of this writing there are 2 versions of this Blu-ray available on Amazon, an import that has been available since Dec. 2012 and the US version that became available in April 2013. I waited until the US version became available to buy this because in the product description it said the US Blu-ray was a 2 disc set. I scoured the internet to find out more but couldn't find any info regarding this. This seemed a bit strange to me but I thought hey, maybe the US is getting some exclusive content so I waited. I just got mine and sure enough it's a single disc.

I called Amazon customer service and all they could do was offer a replacement and take note of my complaint. I mentioned that the Blu-Ray cover insert was reversible, on the outside the UPC was different then the one on the inside. I also noticed that the inside of the cover insert had the green label with the German text and a #12 on it but not the outside. What I think is going on here is that they just flip the insert over depending on what country they are selling it to. I'm convinced that there is no difference between the import or US version. I told the customer service person this but we thought we would try another one anyway. Guess what?, same thing. So as long as they're selling both versions buy the import, it's cheaper. According to the manufacturer the disc is region free and a comment made to a review of the import version on Amazon says it plays fine on a US Blu-ray player. I'm taking 1 star off just because of the issues I had with this and not because of the content, which is excellent.

I own everything Saxon has ever put out and if I were to recommend a single video to a new fan this would be it. It is the most comprehensive of them all. Probably not the best for concert footage but certainly the best for learning about the band. They are totally underrated and under appreciated here in the states. For concert footage I'm really fond of ""Saxon Chronicles"". Another one that's a great bargain is ""Heavy Metal Thunder - Live - Eagles Over Wacken"" which gives you 2 CD's and a DVD. Long Live Saxon!",1365897600,3,2103,4.308080808080808

8537130,5,B009713XY8,"I have to say that there's was a lot of history done in doing this movie,well planned out with former and current players of this nwobhm beginners. Biff and co.went through some tough changes for a reason and there seems to be a calling for a reunion which I don't believe will ever happen. Anyway,great production,performances and sound from this heavy metal band,they seem to get better as time progresses!",1359331200,4,408,4.8428571428571425
