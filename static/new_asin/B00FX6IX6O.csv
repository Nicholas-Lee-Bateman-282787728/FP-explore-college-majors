This was a great event that took place right here in Texas, Houston Texas that is. I was looking forward most to the Womens fight personally but looking at the line up going in I knew it would be great. We even got a fight of the year candidate on this card although I don't think that third round bumped it up to some other fights that years level.

DISC.1

1. JOHN DODSON VS DARRELL MONTAGUE-the opening contest was a flyweight bout with Dodson fighting for the first time after his failed title attempt. He makes up for it in a big way coming out and destroying Darrell after a bit of a feeling out moment. He rocks Montague and lays it on him minutes into the first but Darrell survives the onslaught only to fall victim to Dodsons power once again. Dodson by KO in this one.

2. GABRIEL GONZAGA VS SHAWN JORDAN-this was a battle of two big heavyweights who have a history of knocking people out. Jordan who is a former football player was going in there against the jiu-jitsu ace and was looking for another knock out win. This one doesnt take long as Jordan moves forward throwing and gets caught with a perfectly times and placed right hook by Gonzaga. That is a KO win for Gonzaga.

3. GILBERT MELENDEZ VS DIEGO SANCHEZ-now a lot of people think that this was the best fight from the year but I don't think so. I could think of many others that surpass it but it is still a great fight, especially that third round. The first round starts out well for Diego as he ends up on Melendezs back and looks for the choke. From there most of the round is spent with them trading with Gil landing the better shots even busting Sanchez open. The round ends with both of them engaging in a slugfest that sees Gil drop Sanchez. They spend the second round trading some more shots with Diego even scoring a quick takedown. Then we get the final round which is what most people remember from this fight. The final round is insane as these two just decide to throw nothing but bombs. Gil even gets dropped by a vicious uppercut, the fans went nuts for this fight. Gil gets the UD here but it was a really fun fight, I would to see a rematch eventually.

4. DANIEL CORMIER VS ROY NELSON-I was looking forward to this fight most of all as I am a big Roy Nelson fan. But I knew going in that Cormier is an elite wrestler and he had the potential to decide where this fight would take place. Unfortunately I was right as he spent the first round controlling Roy taking him down and putting him on the cage. When they were trading he was quicker with the strikes taking the round. The second round went just like the first with Daniel controlling the fight and dictating the pace. Same thing follows in the final round with DC taking the UD win, great performance.

5. CAIN VELASQUEZ VS JUNIOR DOS SANTOS-the rubber match that would see who truly is the best heavyweight in the world. JDS knocked Cain out in the first and Cain dominated the second one so this was the one everybody wanted to see. In round one JDS starts out good landing some big shots right from jump but from there Cain works his wrestling and secures some takedowns. The second round looks just like the first with Cains wrestling proving to be the dominate strategy.  The third was like the previous two except this time Cain lands some big punches and even drops JDS. The fourth round is, you guessed it just like the previous three. Cain landed some big shots in this as did JDS but it was  mostly Cain. The final round sees Cain dominating once again and three minutes in gets the TKO victory after escaping a choke attempt.

You get the weigh-ins and the countdown show as the special features on disc one.

DISC 2

1. DUSTIN PAGUE VS KYOJI HORIGUCHI-the first round here would see Pague get Kyojis back and stay there for most of the round, he also gets the takedown towards the end of the round. The second round however is all Kyoji as he landed some big shots and drops Dustin. It is form that point on that he keeps landed some huge shots with his ground and pound until he gets the TKO victory.

2. JEREMY LARSEN VS ANDRE FILI-this was a fun fight as both guys came out aggressive and traded momentum throughout the fight. Larsen took some big shots especially some big knees but also controlled later. It is less than a minute into the next round when it all stops. Jeremy lands a big right hand but gets rocked by Filis right soon after. Shortly after Fili jumps on him and gets the TKO win.

3. TONY FERGUSON VS MIKE RIO-this fight is a short one as both guys come out hard with Rio trying for the take down constantly. Eventually  he tries one too many times and gets caught in a Darce choke. He has to tap giving Tony the win.

4. TJ WALDBURGER VS ADIAN AMAGOV-another fight that ends in the first round as TJ gets knocked out cold by Adian. Adian landed a vicious punch in the clinch that sent TJ down. From there he jumps on him and knocks him out.

5. GEORGE SOTIROPOULOS VS KJ NOONS-one of the fights I was most looking forward to as I am a fan of both of these guys. This fight is more of a chess match as both guys are a little more cautious than normal. KJ lands a bit more in the first round especially to the body which gives him the first round. There is a nice little flurry from both men at the end of the round. The second round is a bit more active with George achieving a takedown. He also looks a bit better with his hands in this round which gives him the round. The final round would see both men landing some great shots with KJ hurting George only for George to land a big head kick a little later. In the end the Judges rightfully give it to Noons with the UD.

6. SARAH KAUFMAN VS JESSICA EYE-the sole womens fight on the card which is always my favorite and most anticipated fight of the night. I love WMMA and love when the ladies throw down. This fight started out really close as both looked good in the first round. They traded shots and leg kicks but I thought Kaufman squeaked it out. The second round was just as close with Eye landing that jab over and over while Sarah landed the bigger shots. The final round is close but Sarah lands some big shots even hurting Eye, in the end Eye gets the surprising Spilt D here. I thought Sarah won every round and the fight.

7. NATE MARQUARDT VS HECTOR LOMBARD-much like the previous fight I was surprised that this fight was not on the main card. These are two names in MMA and both have knock out power so I was expecting this to either end early or be a boring three rounder in which they cancel each other out. It turned out to be a quick fight as Lombard knocks Nate out. He lands a right that starts it all and after chasing him down and dropping him he KOs him on the ground.

8. TIM BOETSCH VS CB DOLLAWAY-I wanted Tim to win this fight so badly going in since I am not really a fan of CB. The first round between these two is a good one as they trade shots and CB looking much better than I thought he would. Another good and close round as this one not only sees them trade but also hit the ground a few times. The final round is just like the first two except with some eye pokes and a point deduction on CB. In the end Tim gets the split D for the win.

Bonus fights

1. CAIN VELASQUEZ VS JUIOR DOS SANTOS-this was the first fight between them on the very first FOX fight. This one does not last long at all. After some feeling out JDS lands an overhand right that drops Cain. From there he swarms and knocks him out on the ground taking the Heavyweight title.

2. JUNIOR DOS SANTOS VS CAIN VELASQUEZ-this was the second fight between them with Cain looking to regain the title. Great first round that stays pretty close for most of it with each landing big shots but once Cain landed that big right he took full control. The second round is all Cain as he dominates this fight on the feet and definitely on the ground. The third round would be a little better for JDS as he landed some good shots and kept the fight mostly on the feet. Still it was Cains round as he controlled and landed some big shots. JDS continues to look better as the forth goes on but once again Cain takes the round. The final round is all Cain was again as he dominates and takes the belt back by way of UD.

This was a great event and it all took place right here in Texas baby. We had some epic fights, great fights, and a great womens fight as well. If you have not seen this event I would recommend getting the DVD if you are an MMA fan.",1394064000,,8486,4.211206896551724
6035305,5,B00FX6IX6O,"I'm addicted to UFC. I own 40-50 DVD's. This is one of the best of all time. Two disk set for $15 makes it a great deal. The prelims are far better than the usual prelims are, so both disks are worthwhile.",1392595200,,205,3.9047619047619047
6035306,4,B00FX6IX6O,"This was a very good card to watch, but only two of the fights are worth paying 60 bucks for imo.

Sanchez vs. Melendez is a classic slugfest between two scrappers who epitomize the longstanding tradition of great Mexican fighters...or at least American fighters of Mexican descent. The sloppiness of the exchanges was a little cringe-worthy at times, but brutal action fights and great technique don't always go together. Can't expect perfection.

The main event was a good fight, but not a great one. More like a repeat of the second bout in the trilogy. Disappointing for anyone who was hoping for a competitive, back-and-forth confrontation. It was also frustrating to watch Cain Valesquez implement such a conservative strategy when he probably could've ended this fight in the third or fourth round if he had really let his hands go. As much as the UFC tries to hype him up as the ultimate ""Mexican"" fighter, he really doesn't fight that way. He spent more time pushing JDS up against the cage than he did unleashing a ferocious attack. Still a good fight with a decisive finish.

Co-main event pretty much sucked and I'll leave it at that.

Gonzaga vs. Jordan involves two B-level fighters and a quick, unexceptional knockout...the kind of fight that really doesn't do a whole lot for me as a paying customer. The night opened with two flyweights, which I don't like at all. I'm of the opinion that flyweights shouldn't be on the main card of a major pay-per-view unless it's a title fight.

So in essence, you've got two fights really worth watching, only one of which is worth repeated viewings. And that's what keeps me from giving this event five stars. Even the good PPVs these days still suffer the effects of a diluted, watered-down product that's rarely worth the price of admission.

And that's all I have to say about that.",1390694400,,1840,4.770440251572327
6035307,5,B00FX6IX6O,"As I've stated before UFC pay-per-views are not exactly what they used to be (this is coming from my own opinion of course).  Since 2009 pay-per-views have been regarded less by the overall quality as the one ""big"" fight of the night.  Thankfully, this is not of those cases.  This to me is the event of the year.  Not only does it highlight the third match in one of the best modern trilogies the UFC has offered in quite some time it has some absolutely devastating finishes from top to bottom while also containing what will almost certainly go down as ""match of the year"".

In the first fight of the main card John Dodson welcomes UFC newcomer Darrel Montague.  Dodson, while perhaps best known for winning season 14 of The Ultimate Fighter, was last seen fighting Demetrious Johnson earlier this year.  While he failed to capture the title he did give Johnson his most difficult test to date since moving down to flyweight.  While there wasn't much known about Montague before this fight he is regarded as a wrestler and actually has as sizable amount of wins by finish.  The fight is largely uneventful until the end, which in typical flyweight style comes fast.  If you're not paying attention you may miss the finish and only capture the victory celebration but as far as KOs go you'll wanna see this one.

Gabriel Gonzaga has gone 3-1 since his return and has looked rather good beyond being finished in by Travis Brown.  To me Gonzaga, while a lethal jiu-jitsu practitioner, will always be remembered as the guy who headkicked Mirko Cro Cop, in what is my favorite knockout of all time.  Gonzaga although unsuccessful in the title department since originally losing to Randy Couture back in 2007 has almost always put on entertaining fights.  For better or worse he hasn't had a fight go to decision since 2010 and may be one of the few heavyweights to fight 4 times within a year, UFC 166 marking his fourth.  Shawn Jordan, Gonzaga's opponent, has been on a successful run himself since entering the UFC.  He holds a record of 4-1 with his only loss in the UFC coming from Cheick Kongo.  He is noted for his big hands and powerful punches and while he was largely controlled by superior wrestling control I thought it would be interesting to see how tough his chin was against another powerful hitter.  This fight, like many heavyweight fights, ends quickly.  Perhaps surprisingly this fight is the quickest fight of the night.  Just like the first fight it ends in devastating fashion.

So, this match is hard to describe without giving away too much, as well as hyping too much.  Gilbert Melendez, former Strikeforce champion, was unsuccessful in his last fight in attaining the UFC lightweight title.  His opponent, Diego Sanchez, is best known as The Ultimate Fighter winner of season 1 of the middleweight division.  He has since become one of the most loved fighters in the UFC thanks to his particular style of fighting that often turns fights into ""fight of the year"" candidates.  This fight is no different.  To me, this will most likely go down as fight of the year.  I'd almost be willing to bet on it if it weren't for two or three other fights this year and we all (or most) know how sometimes voting goes in the MMA world.  So, while I could talk about this fight I think it best if you watch it for yourself and decide.  Either way this is the kind of fight that I have a hard time saying there is a definite loser as both men took away something from this fight.

In the co-main event Daniel Cormier fought against Roy Nelson.  Daniel Cormier is best known as the man who won the Strikeforce heavyweight Grand Prix.  He was undefeated going into this fight and he was successful in his debut fight in the UFC against Frank Mir.  Roy Nelson is a fan favorite known for his big right hand that has put away a considerable amount of fighters.  His main problem though is that he seemed unable to break against the top tier of the heavyweight division always losing just in arms length of a title shot.  This was an interesting fight for the reason that both men had stated beforehand that this fight was looking to like one of, if not the, last fight for these men at heavyweight before their move down to light-heavyweight.  Unfortunately, this fight is the low point of the main card.  It's passable as far as viewing so I have a hard time recommending it but the victor had the right game plan going in and executed it extremely well.  Unfortunately this is the kind of fight that doesn't do much for either fighter in the way of standing since they have both announced their intention to move down to light-heavyweight.

The main event is the third fight in the Velasquez/dos Santos trilogy.  Most MMA fans remember the night when FOX hosted their first UFC event where dos Santos finisehd Velasquez just over one minute into the historic fight.  Then over one year later Velasquez would regain that same title from dos Santos in what may be one of the best complete heavyweight performances today.  The third fight would answer a lot of questions in regards to who was truly the best in the world.  The buildup for this fight was beyond epic and it really engrained a sense of ""the be all to end all"" of heavyweight fights.  Truthfully, that is kind of what it is as these two are the clear 1 and 2 heavyweights in the world.  Without giving away too much this fight more closely resembles the second fight than the first in terms of pace.  Big shots are thrown and the fight goes all over the ring but this is not a quick one round fight.  These men go to war and put on a real nail bitter of a fight.  Although having said that I should mention that this fight does end by finish, in fact this goes on record of the being the latest finish in UFC history.  As I said before, these 2 are the clear 1 and 2 heavyweight fighters in the world so I have a hard time seeing where these two fighters go after this.

Overall, this is the best card of the year in my opinion.  From the finishes to the fantastic fights I think this is a clear cut winner for the UFC and if you buy one card this year this is the one.  As a bonus, the DVD set contains both the first and second fight in the Velasquez/dos Santos trilogy as extras on the second disc which serves as a nice addition to the set given how the UFC DVDs have strayed away from behind-the-scenes features.",1385251200,8,6386,4.475367329299914
