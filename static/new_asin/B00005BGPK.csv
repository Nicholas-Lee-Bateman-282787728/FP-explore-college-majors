Nicole Kidman was unknown when it came out. Now that she's a big star, she probably wants it to be forgotten, but I'm glad it isn't.

It's a great kid's action movie. Anyone who's ever been on a BMX bike will love it, and if you have a sense of humor you'll find David Argue absolutely hysterical.

1422511,3,B00005BGPK,Let's all be honest. We watched this movie because we wanted to see how terrible of an actress Nicole Kidman was in the beginning of her career. BUT I really wouldn't say her performance was THAT bad. Honestly it was very cute listening to her thick Aussie accent. The movie is pretty fun if you go into it with the mindset of it being pretty cheesy and ridiculous. I'll keep it in my movie collection for sure.,1465257600,,411,4.35064935064935
1422512,5,B00005BGPK,I loved this movie. I got to live Manly NSW (movie location) for a year and a half in 1980.  Being from Oregon I've been back there sevaral times. But this movie is a total time capsule and really shines as out represents the time period very well  I showed this to my wife and kids just before taking them there for a month.

1422523,5,B00005BGPK,BMX Bandits is just pure fun. Don't expect to be blown away or even enjoy yourself as you watch Nocole Kidman and two Aussie bike bros stumble into the best action packed BMX romp centered around finding a bunch of walkie talkies. I'll definitely be returning to this movie next time I need to be transported to the BMX fad of the late 80s early 90s! FIVE STARS!!!!,1462492800,,365,4.382352941176471

1422550,4,B00005BGPK,"When I saw this was on DVD I just had to relive it.  Every kid in the 80's had a BMX bike which they rode to school in Australia, I don't know how old I was when I originally saw this movie but watching it today, bike stunts and a few other things don't quite live up to the ""awesome"" memory of the stunts I had, there's lots of riding down stairs and escalators, but overall I'm still glad I watched it again. The waterslide scene I'd remembered all these years was great to see again. Watching BMX Bandits today the main bad guy henchman kind of reminded me of a cross between Billy Idol and Bill from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  This is the type of film where at no time even when they are talking about killing the kids or trying to run them down with their car do you ever believe any of the dim-witted henchman will actually harm the kids.  The movie was rated G when it released, it's definitely a kids' film but that doesn't as an adult you won't also enjoy it.

Nicole Kidman may well be the only actor in this that went onto much of a career, I mean if you go to the IMBD page every other actor has no photograph.  But they all did an all right job, I particularly liked the actor who played the fat rich bully kid, he did a good job.  Most Australian TV shows in the 80's had a fat kid in them who was either full of himself or a bully and always got his comeuppance constantly throughout the film or episode.  Kind of like the character in the American film Goonies but a little different.  Huge walkie talkies where you could actually poke someone in the eye with the long aerial and other retro stuff from the 80's make this a great film to remember the past.

If you want to know the basic plot its simply two kids have their BMX bikes wrecked when the bully kid I mentioned earlier pushes Nicole Kidman's supermarket trolleys she has collected into their path.  Nicole's character is fired and the three kids decide to come up with a plan to repair the two bikes and buy a new one for Nicole, so they decide to collect sea food living in Sydney Harbour to sell.  When pulling up a heavy lobster trap to steal some lucrative crustaceans they instead pull up a well wrapped crate.  Thinking it may have hidden money or something they quickly speed off in their boat as two bank robber thugs come to collect their merchandise needed for an upcoming job.  Somehow even though the thugs are in a powerful racing speed boat and the kids in their inflatable motor boat were close enough for them to come to the conclusion they stole their walkie talkies, they don't actually catch them.  The kids decide to sell the walkie talkies to other kids but also attract the attention of the police since the walkie talkies are set on the police bandwidth. While fixing their bikes with the new parts the boys overhear on the walkie talkies Nicole's character being threatened by the thugs, luckily they seem to be rideable so the boys save her from the thugs then the rest of the film is basically the trio being chased through the Sydney beachside suburb of Manly by the thugs in a car riding their bikes through all kinds of obstacles.

There is the odd poor writing in the script moments such as when the thugs are told about the walkie talkies they are told they can hear the police but the police can't hear them.  The opposite is what happens throughout the rest of the film when the kids use them.  But this sort of adds to the fun of the viewing experience of a classic 80's Australian kid's film.  If you want to watch a similar film with mountain bikes check out the 2012 film Premium Rush with Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",1421798400,,3636,4.329896907216495

Gotta love the classic cult movies with corny 80's music and cool OG bmx bikes and some stunts in-between lol . So if u haven't seen this movie I recommend it to young and old especially if u grew up when this cane out in 83 so find it! buy it! and watch it!

1422585,4,B00005BGPK,I found this movie enjoyable even though it is definitely dated by the stars and the subject.  I would watch this again as it is more wholesome then most new movies Hollywood is giving us today.  I watch for family oriented movies with a good to great storyline and then sit down for an evening with my grandchildren.  We discuss some of the moral issues of old and new.  Time to revisit character behavior and reset out children in a new direction in life from all the trash that lurks and comes into our homes through the TV.,1364601600,,527,4.346938775510204
1422586,2,B00005BGPK,"This is one of the few Nicole Kidman films you would let your kid watch. What could be more cool than riding a bicycle with walkie-talkies hanging out with a kid named Angelo D'Angelo? And then you discover your dad's Playboys and its all over. In this film some kids discover a case of walkie-talkies that belong to a group of robbers planning a job. The police want them too as the kids are stepping all over their police band. Can a group of kids on bikes thwart the robbers and the police?
Ho-hum. Nothing like scenes of kids riding bicycles, popping wheelies, and out smarting adults.

I am not sure kids today would even be interested in this film. And if you're a perv who stalks Nicole Kidman, you might want to pass on this one too unless you are also into bicycle seats. This was made before Kidman could act.

1422587,4,B00005BGPK,"The acting was bad.  The stunts were obviously done by doubles.  The action was completely unbelievable (I loved the magical off-screen use only tracking and teleportation device in the bad guys car) the story and plot were thin and full of holes.

I loved it.

This is exactly the cheesy flick kids love to veg out on.  There's nothing too complicated to comprehend, just one scene poorly connected to the next.

For those of you with the up-tight American ""proper"" mindset some of the dialog is a little racier than would be allowed in a modern G, maybe PG feature.  No real dirty words, just the occasional sexual dialog that just a little over the line for the strong conservative mindset that I'm guessing is completely in the clear for Australia during the early 80's when this was shot.  It's not Disney clean, but might be just within Dreamworks clean.",1352851200,,860,4.6866666666666665

1422589,5,B00005BGPK,"I'll leave reviews of the movie to other reviews. My review is about the question of whether or not to upgrade your DVD copy to a Blu-Ray copy. The answer is: YES.

You wouldn't expect an 80s-era, low budget movie to be improved on quality-wise with a Blu-Ray release, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised. They can't work miracles, obviously -- the audio isn't going to pop in a way it never did before -- but the colours in the picture, and the quality of the picture are way beyond what I would have expected for a movie like this.

Obviously, it's not going to look as good as a brand-new release, but it's easily the best transfer of this movie to date.",1325894400,2,666,4.32
1422610,1,B00005BGPK,"First things first: I have an older pressing of ""BMX Bandits,"" and it is a technical disaster. There is a new (2011) anamorphic version available that evidently fixes the malfunctioning menus, washed out colors, and frequently inaudible sound found on earlier versions (it's probably the worst sound quality I have ever heard on any DVD.) It's even available on Blu-ray! For fans of the movie that's great news, but I couldn't stop wondering why anyone would go through the effort.

I understand watching movies for nostalgic reasons and there are a few films that I feel that way about, and I respectfully realize that this film has a following. I don't get it though: it's in the Australian coming of age comedic crime bungle genre, and stars a very young Nicole Kidman as Judy, who with her friends P. J. (the wonderfully named Angelo D'Angelo) and Goose (James Lugton,) ride their bicycles over, on, and through things in one big chase. Kidman even takes her BMX down a water slide. Don't even ask why. That's pretty much it. The film pits the teens against organized crime and the police to control some stolen goods. What is this incredible cache, you ask? A set of amazingly clunky police radios. There must not be much crime in Australia, because the cops make this their highest priority case, and before it's over we are treated to dramatic interactions with robbers in pig masks, lots of boating (in)action, a pointless chase through a cemetery at night (lightning included, naturally,) and psychoanalysis by radio, among other insipid plotpoints.

To make matters worse, there are some simply wretched 1980s songs and a relentless soundtrack constantly assaulting the audience with boring electronic piano noodling. Of course the big ""attraction"" here is the BMX riding, which fills endless swaths of screen time. For a film that's really just a series of chases stitched together with a couple of expository sentences about (or on) the stolen walkie talkies, it is stunning how boring this picture can be. The menu didn't work properly in my copy in that I couldn't fast forward (seriously; I could skip chapters though, oddly.) You will see why this is a big deal if you watch the movie.

Sometimes I miss the '80s, too, but there are many better ways of remembering that decade than watching Nicole Kidman and two guys ride bicycles all over Australia. The plot is thin, the acting is terrible, the hair is huge, and the music is like fingernails on a blackboard.

As for the movie itself, it is a lot of fun, and seeing Nicole Kidman at 15 is a treat.  This is a kids movie that adults will enjoy as much as the young ones will.  Highly recommended.",1309737600,,535,4.520833333333333
1422613,4,B00005BGPK,"OK, I'm 54 years old and what am I doing watching a movie like this... Remember how as a kid you liked to watch more adult-themed movies so you could fantasize about what it would be like when you grew up? Well, I sometimes watch a film like this so I can fantasize about what it was like when I was a teenager. It's one of my guilty pleasures. The only thing I don't miss is the teenage angst. Fortunately this movie didn't have too much of that, it was just fun.

The BMX sport which later became a craze was just getting started when I was in high school, and it was interesting to watch here. The film is not Oscar material, and some would consider it a hokey teen exploitation movie. Thankfully there wasn't any noticeable bad language or explicit sex. One reviewer said it fits into the ""so bad it's good"" category. Maybe, but for me anyway it seems a little better than that.

Also, as an American I found it more interesting to watch because it's an Australian-made film. I bought it in a five-movie collection DVD I found in the bargain bin at WalMart, and I wasn't really paying too much attention to who was in it when I popped it in to relax one evening. As I was looking at the girl, I thought, ""She looks kind of familiar with her Aussie accent... hey wait...could it be? It's Nicole Kidman!"" Her presence made me keep watching to see how she handled her earliest film role.

The criminals in the movie start off as real badasses, with ominous music playing in the background (which later becomes amusing). A couple of them quickly degenerate into ""Home Alone"" style bad guys ineptly chasing the two dudes and Nicole all over the city (including going down the tubes of a water slide!). The teenagers could now identify them, and had taken the walkie-talkies (remember them?) that the crooks needed to tap into the police band radio frequency to stay ahead of the cops. In the police station there is a police woman who seems willing to be sympathetic to the teens. I thought she was hot. When the chief's back is turned, she bites one of her fellow officer's ears. I envied him.

All in all, I enjoyed this movie, and if you don't expect too much from it, you might also. The scenery is really good to look at, and the sunny seaside city really lifted my spirits. The exuberance of young people having a good time did, too.",1292976000,17,2338,4.405092592592593

I'd highly recommend this or Escape 2000 as an introduction to one of the most underappreciated action movie directors of our time.",1243900800,,975,4.969325153374233
