5989155,1,B00FFB1KTE,"These discs are not made in the USA. I could tell right away as the rating system was different. I had a little trouble getting them to play in one of my Blu-ray players, but eventually got it to work. Can't beat the price though.

Updated. Just started watching and after about 20 min it shut my Blu-ray player off and won't play anymore.",1528934400,,339,4.296875

5989161,5,B00FFB1KTE,Great value for getting three movies on Blu-ray. All three will play on any blu-ray player since they're region free. Would definitely recommend if you're looking to save a few bucks. The movies looked great too quality wise.,1527033600,,225,4.947368421052632
5989162,3,B00FFB1KTE,I never had issues with these playing in my Blu Ray player aka ps3-4. My big issue and the reason for the 3 stars is that they don't come with the digital copies!!! Why spend this kind of $$$ that doesn't give you everything?,1526774400,,225,4.136363636363637

5989164,2,B00FFB1KTE,"While the movies themselves are fine and playable, the artwork on the dvd's (namely the spine) is awful. Iron Man 1 and 2 match up almost perfectly and look fine, but the text and pictures on the spine of Iron Man 3 do not match the other two whatsoever. See attached photo. One would think that when buying a box set of movies, all 3 would at least look similar, but not in this case. It looks like the publisher didn't even try. Oh and to add insult to injury, the movies are inserted into the paper case backwards, so you don't even realize the artwork is messed up until after you break the stretch wrap and remove the discs, making the item non-returnable.",1526169600,,661,4.338709677419355

Aside from that, its really just a cheaper way to buy all three Iron Man films in one convenient box set. They do each have their own case, within the box, but I was fine with that. 4 stars only because Im not a fan of the final film as much as the first two.",1523491200,4,428,3.9310344827586206

Also, they are sold as multi format, but the only one that actually comes with both formats is Iron Man 3.",1508284800,12,340,4.014705882352941
5989289,5,B00FFB1KTE,"A really good deal for the Iron-Man trilogy. I have to stress to you that I'm not a big superhero fan. I don't really like superhero movies. They're too commercialized for me, meaning they're mostly just 90% action and 10% Hollywood fluff, and I'm not cray about action movies. Iron Man however is an exception. First of all, I really enjoy Robert Downey Jr. as an actor. I love his sense of humor and find him hilarious and he was basically born to play Tony Stark. Secondly, the Iron Man films are more rounded (in my opinion anyway) and they include humor and drama among the action that i don't find corny or over the top like in other superhero movies. If you saw the first Iron Man and liked it, you'll mostly likely enjoy the second and third because I feel like the movies got better as they went on. This set is a great deal and it was definitely worth the money.",1507507200,,872,4.323170731707317

5989298,5,B00FFB1KTE,"I loved the first movie, liked the second and third.  All are entertaining and getting all 3 movies for this price is excellent.  Blu Rays all worked and I had no problems.

Iron Man is by far the best of the three.  It really started the Marvel movie experience that seems to put out good movie after good movie.  I was never an Iron Man fan of the comics, but this movie is so entertaining, I just wanted to own it.

The second and third movies are weaker, but do have redeeming qualities themselves.  I like War Machine in the 2nd and though I really like Don Cheadle as an actor, I was a little disappointed that Terrance Howard got replaced.  I always feel like you pay your dues getting less air time, you deserve a shot at the hero side.  I could also do without all those Iron Man copies in the 3rd movie.  But if you're looking for some action, these movies have it in spades.

If you want all three and don't need super designs in the boxes, this package was perfect.",1503964800,4,977,4.227027027027027

Not that everyone is a big superhero buff, but I love how these movies tie in with other superhero movies, from the Avengers to Thor to the Incredible Hulk.

I purchased the Iron Man 3-Movie Collection for $16.59 and thought it was a great deal for all three movies. The movies came very well packaged and were in good condition. No scratches or anything. The discs were brand new in factory sealed cellophane. These are factory discs.

Special features were as follows:

Iron Man: Deleted and Extended Scenes.
Iron Man 2: Commentary by Jon Favreau
Iron Man 3: Deconstructing the scene: Attack on Air Force One / Behind the scenes look at Thor: The Dark World / Digital Copy Download

All three movies are Widescreen Versions and have Dolby Digital 5.1 Dolby Digital.

I enjoyed watching all three of these films again. I've seen these movies in my local store for almost $20 a piece in some places. So for the price I paid here, it's a bargain in my opinion. Glad I made this purchase.",1493769600,,841,4.617449664429531

I didn't like it in the comics and I don't like it here.  Enough said.  Finally, the villain for the last movie is disappointing compared to the first two movies.

There is literally no reason to buy them separately when this exists.
The movies themselves are seriously amazing, but to add context, i'd recommend watching all of the marvel movies in order of release as it's an extremely rewarding experience.",1472515200,8,455,4.922077922077922

This package contains all three in individual cases, rather than a single case as most collections do. However, due to the fact that you're able to purchase all three of these Marvel movies for no more than $5 more than most of the Marvel Blu-rays, I certainly cannot complain.

As far as the movies go, all three are very entertaining and worth watching at least once. But it's the first Iron Man movie that really shines. It is undoubtedly among my favorite films ever.",1471046400,,630,4.526315789473684

The only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star is because the movies are individually wrapped, unlike other collections where the movies would either be put in the same dvd box or they'll have a box to hold the three dvd boxes. It's more of a personal preference thing, I like it held together so it's more organized, and if you have a lot of dvd's like I do, you can easily find all three movies if you want to have a marathon.

5989831,5,B00FFB1KTE,"This collection exceeded my expectations. All three movies come in their own separate cases which I love. I often find that the packaging in collections is cheap, easy to damage or really just not the easiest. In this package they are all separate like they would be if you bought them individually. Now as far as the movies go, I love them. Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect for these movies, he's sarcastic and arrogant but in a way that you u still love he character. If you haven't seen these movies, or are just wanting to rewatch  them then I would definitely reccomend this set.",1455580800,,580,4.523809523809524

This is a secret santa present for a friend, and was really only looking for the 3rd movie in the trilogy. Our limit was 30 dollars. I managed to get him all 3 movies for under that so I could afford to buy him Avengers Age of Ultron as well. All in all, very happy, and I would say money well spent. I haven't watched the movies, or opened the plastic wrap they came in, but I assume all is right.",1450742400,,524,3.952830188679245

5990036,5,B00FFB1KTE,"This is a collection, not a boxed set. The Blu-Ray movies are well presented in individual cases, and in case you missed the description Iron-Man 3 is a Blu-Ray DVD combo pack too. It was a nice surprise.  The movies played well in my player, which they should, and I had no complaints about he menus or the quality of the picture or any of the myriad other idiotic things that peple whine about in reviews.

I am not sure if this review should include substantive reviews of the actual movies. . . I would suggest atht you watch a movie before buying a copy for repeated viewings, so if you are looking to buy I assume that you like these movies. That being said, I will give a one-word summation of all three movies: Awesome! Big Tony Stark fan here, and the movies do a good job of bringing this character some depth and complexity as part of the new Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I like that each film has it's own case and it's not a boxset. One of the cases was broken when I received it. It was Iron Man 2 (so it was sandwiched between two other cases). The cases were vacuum sealed together and it was in bubble-wrap packaging so I doubt the damage occurred during transport. There's only one disc per case and some of the discs say ""Disc 1"" on them.

These movies complement each other and are all Marvel classics.

5990342,5,B00FFB1KTE,"This is a not a ""collection"" but simply all three Iron Man films grouped together in their separate packaging.  However, if you're looking start, complete or upgrade your collection of MCU films, this one is a good deal.

The films? It's Robert Downey, Jr. as hyperactive man-child Tony Stark with all the snark, special effects and fun you expect from the Marvel movies. If you haven't seen them, let me suggest you watch Iron Man, Iron Man II, jump over to the Avengers, then watch Iron Man III. There are flaws in all of them, but Downey is a joy, with some of his funniest and best scenes interacting with JARVIS or Tony's robots. And, while Iron Man II is considered by many the weakest of the three, it does have two of the best moments in the Iron man series. First Coulson telling Stark, ""If you try to escape, or play any sort of games with me, I will taze you and watch ""Supernanny"" while you drool into the carpet.""

The second is a hungover Stark in the suit sitting in the center of the iconic Randy's Donuts sign as dawn breaks over LA. ""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut.""

Tony Stark in a giant concrete donut. What more can one ask?",1434412800,19,1164,4.325688073394495

5990363,4,B00FFB1KTE,"Tony Stark didn't seem like anyone's idea of a superhero -- he was a hedonistic billionaire genius who made all sorts of weapons for the US military.

But this unlikely superhero ended up turning the Marvel movies into a world-dominating franchise, which all started with a guy in a metal suit. The ""Iron Man"" trilogy has its ups and downs (the controversial Mandarin casting), but overall A lot of the movie's entertainment comes from Robert Downey Jr.'s charming, powerful performance as the title character, but these stories are also filled with explosions, high-octane action scenes, and connections to other Marvel movies.

While in the Middle-East, Tony Stark (Downey) is attacked and kidnapped by a terrorist cell, who want him to create weapons for them. Even worse, he has bits of shrapnel in his chest that -- if not restricted by an electromagnet -- will pierce his heart and kill him. With the assistance of a fellow imprisoned scientist, Tony manages to construct a weapon for himself: an iron suit that bashes and blasts his way out of there.

However, Tony's experience has shaken him -- he shuts down the weapons division of Stark Industry, goes into seclusion, and builds a metal suit with all the latest tech, including an arc reactor and repulsors. But as he uses his new suit to clean up hotbeds of terrorism, he doesn't realize that his old friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is determined to create an iron suit of his own -- and turn it into the ultimate weapon.

In ""Iron Man 2,"" Tony seems to have everything he needs -- fame, adoration, the new Stark Expo, and his new girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). And when the grasping government tries to get ahold of his armor, he makes it clear that ""I have privatized world peace."" But no one knows that the core of his arc reactor is slowly poisoning him, and his mortality is driving him to increasingly erratic, risk-taking behavior.

Then a deadly enemy appears -- Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian ex-con who blames Tony and his father for the destruction of his own father's life. Even worse, he has the ability to create weapons to rival Tony's own. With the help of the bratty industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), he sets out to destroy Tony Stark before the world -- and to survive, Tony will need help from a very unexpected source.

""Iron Man 3"" takes place some months after ""The Avengers,"" and Tony is now crippled by fear. Not only is he struggling with panic attacks and insomnia, but he is desperately building a whole army of Iron Man suits. Then a mysterious terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) unleashes a series of bombings on US soil -- one of which injures Happy (Jon Favreau). When the angry Tony challenges him, the Mandarin bombs his seaside mansion to the ground, and Tony is presumed dead.

However, he's not actually dead. He's stranded in Tennessee with only a broken suit and JARVIS. And as he works to fix his suit, Tony discovers that the terrorists are somehow involved with an experimental virus known as Extremis -- which the think-tank genius Killian (Guy Pearce) has been showing off to Pepper. Now Tony must not only get himself back together, but unravel an elaborate conspiracy centered around Extremis. If he doesn't, he may lose everything that he loves.

""The Iron Man Trilogy"" is the bedrock of the current Marvel cineverse. While their movies have spun out in different directions, these movies laid out the foundation for everything they did later -- the organization known as SHIELD works its way into the story, and Tony finds himself dealing with the problems of a world caught in the middle of a galactic war. And of course, there's that giant anti-authoritarian streak, with Tony thumbing his nose at a greasy, sleazy Congressman who wants to claim his suit, much to the delight of the public.

But even if you take these three movies on their own merits, they are still delightful blockbusters -- lots of shiny explosive action (Tony punching through a wall to beat up a terrorist), lots of tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut!""), and plots that are simple but still have some excellent twists. They do have some flaws, though -- the second movie has a villain too similar to the first's, and many fans howled when they found out the twist about the Mandarin in the third.

Robert Downey Jr. was simply the ideal choice for Tony Stark -- he comes across as intelligent and quick-witted, with sharp snarky repartee and lots of charm. His Tony is an irritating, arrogant guy, but he has a good heart underneath it all. And as the trilogy winds on, it becomes obvious that his confidence covers a core of fear -- whenever he encounters something bigger, badder and more dangerous than he is, he tries to use technology to make himself feel safe.

And there's a solid cast surrounding it -- Don Cheadle as Tony's best buddy, a budding superhero in his own right who keeps the crazy billionaire somewhat grounded; Scarlett Johansson as an acrobatic superspy who can effortlessly take out a dozen men at once; Sam Rockwell as a dorky crooked industrialist who desperately wants to surpass Tony (and may have a crush on him); and Paul Bettany as the acerbic British AI known as JARVIS.

The ""Iron Man"" trilogy is a must-see for fans of the Marvel movies, fans of superhero movies, or just anyone who enjoys a big splashy blockbuster with lots of wild action and interesting twists. Smart, entertaining and intense.",1433203200,4,5493,4.7766069546891465

Loved Scarlet Johansson as Natasha. I had forgotten she was in number 2. Could care less about Gwyneth Paltrow, though. She stinks as an actress, but she was ok in these films......

Iron Man 3 was a HUGE disappointment, however. The movie was disjointed, didn't flow well, and the plot and direction just didn't seem to be as well thought out. I give this set only 3 stars, due to that last movie sequel being such a let down..RDJ is a great actor, but there was only so much even he could do with the plot.

My only real complaint is that each of the seperate disc cases had some wear/tear of the plastic covering on the edge. Each case also has a ""Not for Individual Sale"" sticker on the back which is hard to get off and leaves the plastic wrinkled.

I honestly don't mind them being packed this way, all I wanted were the Blu-Rays, so I'm happy. If you don't mind not having digital copies, this is a great deal for all three films!",1428883200,,673,4.224806201550388

Nothing fancy, just the three movies in separate cases shrink-wrapped together with a one-page insert on the back of the package. All three disc cases are labeled 'not for individual sale'. As near as I can tell, the discs are new, not used. I didn't see any scratches or blemishes on the discs. All in all, a fantastic deal for these three movies.",1428537600,209,502,4.294736842105263

5990477,5,B00FFB1KTE,"I was initially confused by the packaging, as this box set appears to have been produced for the UK market (notice the rating emblem... it says '12' rather than 'PG-13').  Fortunately,  this isn't an issue.  These discs are region free, and play just fine on my USA market BD player (unlike DVDs, which were all region coded, many Blu-ray Discs are region free... however, some are still region coded, and the regions are different from DVDs, so research before you buy anything foreign).

All that aside, I am thoroughly pleased with this product.  Take note, this is just the Blu-rays, and not a BD DVD Digital Copy combo pack, which is fine by me.  I mean, $35 for the Ironman trilogy on Blu-Ray?  That's fantastic!

As for the movies themselves, I cannot give an unbiased review, as my wife and I are both enormous Marvel fans.  We actually bought this for each other for our anniversary.  Yeah, we're that into it.  Don't judge us.

With that disclaimer, I'll say that Ironman is an epically good film, by anyone's standards.  The other two, even though they get picked on a lot,  fail to live up to the first film in any way shape or for, and reinterpret the Marvel canon in some ways that are less than pleasing... really aren't bad.  In fact, if either one of them had been a stand-alone film, outside of the wildly successful juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I think they'd receive high reviews.  I mean, Ironman 2 could have been better... much better.  But compare it to Man Of Steel (which, as of now, is the only film in the current DC Cunematic Universe)... and it starts to look a lot better.  Am I right?

Anyway, get this trilogy, and have a marathon.  Watch them all in one sitting.  Most...epic...date...night...ever!

5990503,4,B00FFB1KTE,"This isn't really a review, I just thought I'd give potential customers some handy information about the films:

IRON MAN - 2008 - 126 minutes - Director: Jon Favreau - Starring: Robert Downey Jr, Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges - Genre: Superhero, action - Plot: Tony Stark, a charismatic billionaire, invents an armored suit that he uses to fight crime. PG-13

IRON MAN 2 - 2010 - 124 minutes - Director: Jon Favreau - Starring: Robert Downey Jr. Gwenyth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Mickey Rourke - Genre: Superhero, action - Plot: Iron Man now faces down multiple menaces, both to his health and status, and maybe his life. PG-13

IRON MAN 3 - 2013 - 130 minutes - Director: Shane Black - Starring: Robert Downey Jr. Gwenyth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley - Genre: Superhero, action - Plot: Iron Man now faces down his deadliest adversary yet: the ruthless Mandarin, as he finally faces down the ultimate question: is is the machine that makes the man, or the other way round? PG-13

Finally, let's crunch some numbers. This set costs $55.52, and contains 3 films. When we divide the price by the number of films, we get a price of $18.50 per film, which is $5.50 more than the Blu-rays for Iron Man 1 and 2, but is $10.67 CHEAPER than Iron Man 3's Blu-ray. When you add the prices for the individual Blu-rays, you get $55.09, saving you 43 cents, but when you factor in the SHIPPING, this Blu-ray set is the BETTER DEAL. I hope this information is helpful to you. Cheers!",1397088000,159,1487,4.621212121212121
