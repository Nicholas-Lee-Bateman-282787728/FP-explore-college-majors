3147244,5,B0015RB6LO,"I am hooked to Step-Boxing.  It's fun, the hour goes by quickly when your having fun.  I use wrist weights to make the workout/punches more advanced, but my wrists are small so I have to grip them in my hands.  It's still very effective to pump up your heart when the going slows down for a few moments, although if you have slow moments it's only because you are not going at your max.  I don't think this DVD is for beginners.",1235779200,3,428,4.182926829268292
3147245,4,B0015RB6LO,"I have been doing both step-aerobics and kickboxing for several years and got quite a good workout with this DVD. As mentioned in previous reviews, the cueing is quite poor compared to Cathe Fredrich's workouts, but if you do the tutorial before starting the actual workout it does help. I had to focus throughout the workout to not make any mistakes. By the third time I was much more comfortable and actually used weighted gloves while exercising with this DVD.

The first 60 minutes is a combination of step and kickboxing, followed by approximately 10 minutes of pure kickboxing. The next segment is abdominals done in the kneeling position which is very unusual followed by a cool down. The overall workout time is almost 80 minutes.

This workout is definitely for people who are used to step workouts, i.e. moderately advanced.

Overall, I have enjoyed this DVD!",1210291200,6,869,4.8979591836734695
3147246,3,B0015RB6LO,"Cardio Kick Step-Boxing is Kelly Coffey-Meyers' second workout combining kickboxing and step; in fact, it's often referred to as ""Step-Boxing 2.""  I didn't tried the first workout, but many complained that Kelly moved too fast in that one.  Cardio Kick Step-Boxing is energetic and upbeat as well, so you'll definitely need to have a head for complicated step moves to follow along with Kelly.  You'll need a full vertical step for this workout, which would be difficult to modify without; one of the four background exercises does occasionally show low-impact modifications.  The main menu of this DVD is as follows:

Kelly begins with the step in a vertical position (perpendicular to your TV) for a 6-minute, high-energy warm-up which includes a few hamstring stretches at the end.  Continuing with the step in this position, she leads you 4 separate routines, each about 5.5 minutes in length (22 minutes total).  After a pause for a heart rate check and to move to step to a horizontal position, Kelly continues with another 3 routines in this position, again for about 22 minutes total.  The last 8 minutes of the cardio portion consist of 2 floor-only kickboxing routines.  For all of the step cardio work, each routine ends with a ""drill,"" which is about a 2-minute segment where Kelly does just one of moves repeatedly.  The core segment of this workout is unique in that it is done from a kneeling position (one knee on 1/2 roller; 8 minutes total).  Finally, Kelly finishes things off with a 4.5 minute cool-down which includes some yoga stretches.

The DVD also offers several premixes:
Vertical Mix, 29.5 mins (warm-up, vertical step, core, & stretch)
Horizontal Mix, 37.5 mins (warm-up, horizontal step, combos 8 & 9, core, & stretch)
Core Mix, 12.5 mins. (kneeling core & stretch)

During the cardio portion, Kelly jumps right into each sequence with little cueing.  She seems to expect you to have already watched the tutorial and to have the moves down, and thus her cueing is pretty minimal, making the view responsible for remembering what comes next.  Even with the tutorial, I was totally unable to keep up with Kelly's complicated combinations, and so I quickly became frustrated.  You're never performing simple punch-kick combinations here; Kelly sequencing is unique and different, but as a result, it often felt awkward to me.  Usually, I am able to handle a little bit of complexity after some repetition, but that was not the case here.  Finally, this workout requires LOTS of room--you'll need plenty of space both in front of and to either side of your step.

For someone who enjoys complex choreography and is familiar with both step aerobics and kickboxing, I definitely see how this workout could be a lot of fun.  Kelly herself has a great personality and is full of energy, and I really enjoy her strength workouts.  However, anyone who has issues with learning complicated moves is likely to experience problems with Kelly's cardio as I did, and so I would not recommend this workout for those who prefer more basic choreography like myself.",1202947200,15,3209,4.992481203007519
3147247,5,B0015RB6LO,"This is a really good workout because it's somewhat unique.  It integrates kickboxing with step.  It's about 45 minutes of cardio (longer with the warm up and cool down) and it uses kickboxing moves and also regular step too.  You may need to use the 11 minute tutorial because she cues so fast and doesn't slow to even give instruction.  It finishes with some oblique ab exercises as well to round it off.
I really love this.  I love the fast pace of this because it keeps it interesting and challenging, but I'd love a little better cuing.  What saves this from being a little impossible or frustrating is that helpful tutorial and you will also be thankful for that.  Overall, this is a very good fat burning workout that I love to do (and definately feel it afterward).",1199750400,24,773,4.517985611510792

8259705,4,B0015RB6LO,This is a good workout with lots of variety that works multiple muscles and doesn't get boring . . . but I was surprised to find that the queuing was not what I've come to expect from Coffey-Meyer. A few more times through and I should be able to better manage the barely-queued transitions and get the full benefits.,1499040000,,317,4.389830508474576

8259708,4,B0015RB6LO,I like this workout but it is hard to follow the cues and still feel like you are getting a good workout.  I just ordered  couple more videos and hope they do not turn out the same.  I do own other videos of Kelly's and love them!,1422144000,,230,3.851063829787234

8259710,1,B0015RB6LO,"I really like Kelly Coffey-Meyer, but this workout was a huge disappointment.  Although I'm painfully uncoordinated I fully expected to catch onto this after a few tries, such as I have in the past with other step routines.  No such luck.  I did try several times, but the moves were entirely too fast and intricate, even for an intermediate stepper.  I'll keep and continue to enjoy Kelly's other offerings, but this one is headed to a table at our next yard sale.",1405036800,,465,4.634146341463414
8259711,5,B0015RB6LO,"Love this workout!  I netflixed a while back and enjoyed it so much I had to buy it.  It's great cardio and a lot of fun...it makes you enjoy the workout and not realize how hard you are pushing your body. I am usually drenched with sweat during and after the workout and I am a pretty physically fit woman.  I work out daily to Cathe Freidrich, Shawn T. and Jillian Michaels.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a challenge!",1394409600,,438,4.37037037037037
8259712,5,B0015RB6LO,"I have several of Kelly's videos, this is my absolute favorite. You will definitely sweat through this workout with her!",1393977600,,120,5.05
8259713,4,B0015RB6LO,"I never did kickboxing nor step aerobic classes in my life. However, as a child I did 6 years of ballet and jazz dancing and I do consider myself in the range of OK to gifted in catching how a move works, catching the rhythm and so on.

This workout consists of fast-paced moves with a challenging choreography. I'm really working on catching up but it's frustrating to fall off the wagon again and again and having to rewind the DVD and repeat the move 5 times only to finally being able to sort of moving with the group and then ... falling off a little later when Kelly is changing the move again. The tutorial helps a little bit though,- I worked through it several times.
This workout is probably more for people who are already familiar with step-kickboxing.
Another drawback: you need a LOT of room.

I guess after a few weeks I'll master the whole workout, but I usually prefer workouts that I can follow immediately.

You sure get out of breath with this workout and I think that once you master the moves it'll be really fun and time will just fly because you need to focus intensely.

I also own Kelly's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kelly-Coffey-Meyer-NYC-Body-Sculpting-Workout/dp/B000ROA068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kelly Coffey-Meyer: NYC Body Sculpting Workout</a>&nbsp;and totally love that one!!

UPDATE 23.09.2013 from 2stars to 4 stars: I'm almost through this DVD - I did it step by step, from week to week I've added another sequence of moves. It really took me a lot of work (and time) to learn the moves (sometimes I used slow motion to learn the move) but now it's a lot of fun. This workout is not only a challenge for your fitness but also for your mind as you need to focus intensely in order to not fall off the wagon. But once you master it, it's really a great workout!!
4 stars instead of 5 because of the time+effort one needs to put into learning the moves.",1376956800,,1938,4.807807807807808
8259714,5,B0015RB6LO,"This is the first video I have from Kelly.  It definitely isn't for beginners, but I loved it.  I did the tutorial twice before attempting the workout.  It was a challenge, to say the least.  If you don't like difficult choreography, this probably isn't the video for you.  I love that it has the full workout, as well as options for shorter workouts when time is an issue.  You do need space as well.  I would classify my fitness level as intermediate, and definitely worked hard in this video.  I am looking forward to purchasing more video workouts from Kelly.",1262131200,4,563,4.56
