7346464,4,B012BYDK90,"And here we find ourselves with yet another series of re-releases of the Friday the 13th franchise.

There are no versions of the feature films. There are no new special features. The contents of these discs is exactly identical to those that were included in the 2013 blu-ray box set that collected the Paramount franchise up to and including Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 remake. For those of you who own that now OOP set, there's nothing new to gain from buying these two disc sets.

The practical upshot of these is that if you don't own the complete set, you can pick and choose which films you'd rather have in relative comfort, and it also saves you the grief of the horrifying packaging that was inflicted upon the 2013 complete series box set (discs were damaged by the cardboard sleeve casing, as well as ill-placed dollops of packaging glue). Just be warned that your order may take some time to ship: I pre-ordered the Part V/Part VI set here at Amazon -- those are my favorite films in the series -- and it has yet to ship and is listed as temporarily out of stock. This in spite of my having placed the pre-oder back in July. It seems the sets are selling relative well, then.

If you haven't picked up the complete series box set, you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up all of the Blu-ray Double Feature Sets. They sell at a great price and you get all the content on the full set.",1441670400,3,1403,4.347328244274809
7346465,5,B012BYDK90,"Paramount are re-issuing all 8 Friday the 13th films again this time in seperate blu-ray case packaging
so the HD transfers & the sound quality are probably the same from the 2013 versions
and all the special features, and i mean all of them from the Deluxe edition dvd's
have been carried over, which they definitely should be carried over there's no reason not to
Paramount have bad reputation of reissuing old classics on blu-ray but leaving out the extras for some reason
very stupid pathetic decision i think
so some of their barebones blu-ray's don't sell cause all the extras have been left off, very pathetic
but thankfully Paramount did not do that with the Friday the 13th films
they give the series alot of respect and Decided to carry
 over all the special features from the old Deluxe editions on to these new blu-ray versions
one of the best Decisions Paramount has done
as a fan of the series myself, it would a big insult to leave out the extras
so FT13 1 & 2 have their own case + extras, FT13 3 & 4 have their own case + extras
FT13 5 & 6 have their own case + extras and so on....
these new re-issues are available on amazon from Tuesday sept 8
so either buy them or stick with the 2013 blu-ray collection , up to you
5 stars based on all the special features have been carried over",1441152000,,1301,4.331967213114754
7346466,5,B012BYDK90,"Update 10-13-2015
These BR's do exist the demand has been crazy (so for everyone who has pre-ordered these two disc Sets) You'll get them
Also both films and all extras are on One BR disc
(which makes sense since BR Disc can hold lots of Data on one disc)  Photo Below

Talk about pure irony that the two FT13 Films that are so different share this double  feature Set

Friday the 13th part V A New Beginning
Is in my top 3 of all the Friday the 13th Films
Fans judge this film poorly due to Jason not being the killer (But, in the original Friday the 13th Jason wasn't the killer either But, that Film gets this strange  reverence towards it while A New Beginning is the red headed step child that gets very little love and should be looked at in a much higher respect as far as Horror Films (It's Close to flawless) If you told Larry Flynt  to direct a FT13 film
Friday the 13th part 5 would be that film
what you'll get on this Blu Ray Double Feature
the Deluxe Edition of a New Beginning and all the extras will be on the disc
**Commentary by Director/co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann w/Cast and Crew (Awesome Commentary Mr. Steinmaann is no longer with us) This in my honest opinion is the best commentary on all the FT13 Films..... It's just refreshing and honest  John Shepherd found religion and agreed to do this audio commentary which i always thought was so cool (He didn't have to do it)
**New Beginnings: The Making of FT13 Part V A New Beginning  (also very cool)
**Original Theatrical Trailer
**Lost Tales from Camp Blood part 5.
**The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited Part II (these two extras are Horrid Not sure why Quality Control allowed this on any home video format it's just cheap and makes Horror fans look like Hillbillies that screw there cousins) I think they only threw these two extras on to pad the disc?
then again it could've been a massive ""F"" you from Paramount to the fans let's be honest Paramount has Never respected the fans
Look at how many dvd's have been put out over the last 15 years (just on dvd alone) Paramount don't understand and will never respect the Horror Genera
Breakdown of FT13 part V A New Beginning (not to be confused with a Nude Beginning)
this film is simple but, at the same time layered
Tommy Jarvis returns now played by John Shepherd
Keep in mind up until The Final Friday the survivors were usually Strong Females
Tommy Jarvis would be the only male Character that would live on and be in many ways Jason's nemesis
Is starts off with a so/so Dream scene with Corey Feldman  making a cameo
This Dream sequence is interesting now 'Cause the digging up of Jason was done very much like this in FT13 part VI Jason Lives
The film takes place 5 years into the future. (This is also the start of the Friday the 13th Time Line going all over the place) Not really this films fault though cause the director's after this didn't add logic to the Big picture (but, back in the 1980's everyone was so coked up I doubt a time line mattered to anyone)
Tommy being a complete basket case (after the events of The Final Chapter) is being  transfer to  Pinehurst; a halfway house/group home for troubled teens
even the orderly taking him to this place (are sleazy looking grease balls)  And I love it
you meet the two Adults (It's set up these two might be the main Characters)
Melanie Kinnaman as Pam  (Always loved her in this film she was hot but, very strong) I wish she did more in Hollywood
Still to this day she looks amazing! Pam is so under appreciated in the FT13 Series
Richard Young as Matt (The Home's on site Dr.) liked him and his performance but, he always seemed to young to be a Dr. of any kind
 Shavar Ross as  Reggie, the reckless  (Everyone knows him from  Diff'rent Strokes) It's odd they picked him in casting but, he really good and @ times scream more then Pam!!!!
the strange thing about this group home it's never fully explained why they are there (What kind of Home it's for)
Juliette Cummins as Robin
Tiffany Helm  as Violet (Blonde goth chick in mid 1980's Violet was a Suicide Girl before there were any Suicide Girls) and her Dance has become Iconic
Jerry Pavlon as Jake
Mark Venturini  (19611996)  as  Vic  (Mark had major potential he was Chicago Actor that made it in Hollywood and the world lost him way to soon it's a shame  he past away at 35) Also known for Return of the Living Dead
Dominick Brascia as Joey. (who would later become a Radio personality  co-producer of Talk Radio Shows)
John Robert Dixon as Eddie
Deborah Sue Voorhees as Tina (why she is in this home i don't know unless being a nymphomaniac needs fixing)
This chick is Real Deal Playboy Centerfold hot! beautiful and flwaless  (I'm sure Danny Steinmann picked her without a doubt)
Marco St. John as Sheriff Tucker (the scenes he are in are Great! wish we got more of him) always like his character having Marco St. John brought Legitimacy to this film....
Dick Wieand as Roy aka Jason copycat (I understand why he was chosen his reactions are telling of the upcoming events in the film)
Then you have these oddball Characters that come out of nowhere and each one add a little to the film! (Even when you don't need them)
 Carol Locatell as  Ethel Hubbard  (The Queen of the Trailer Park)  Carol was at this point a legit seasoned actress they put this crazy looking hooker wig on her and she owns it! In her younger years she was a very attractive woman
She steals every scene she is in.  'Cause it's so over the top and crazy but, it works in this flick!
Then you have Ethel's son Jr. played by Ron Sloan
Ron and Carol's love/hate chemistry as a mother son is Priceless and very enjoyable to watch
you have these two 1950's looking Greasers  Pete and Vinnie  broke down in the woods trying to go get there ladies! These two clowns are the Burt and Ernie of the 1980's (wink, wink)
this scene is odd and don't really fit But, they to are just fun to watch (Both there deaths are heavily cut)
Then you have a stand out scene with
Billy the  sleazy male orderly who drove Tommy to Pinehurst in the opening of the film returns he's off the clock and wants to party with his girl
Lana (Played by Rebecca Wood) and when i say party I mean do  a huge amount of cocaine and have premarital sex (What the 1980's were all about) Billy calls for Lana.....
Lana has to close up the Dinner (I've never in my life seen any type of waitress that looks like a 1980's Porn Star) Lana goes inside looks at herself in the mirror takes off her waitress outfit/top and says the now famous line ""It's Show Time"" while you see her topless....
Why is this in here???? Why not Attractive topless Chick A+
While she is getting ready you have Billy doing a line of coke of a mirror in his car! very classy
Lana is closing up the dinner (then you have this strange jump scare where somebody on the crew threw a cat at Lana this wasn't no CGI cat this was a legit stunt cat or a ally cat who really knows for sure) I only bring this up cause you can tell somebody just threw the poor cat at the actresses feet.
The two are killed off
Then you have this actor playing the Mayor (Who walk onto the wrong set this guy looks and sounds like he should be in The Godfather III not FT13 part 5
Tina and Eddie sneak off into the woods to have sex
Ethel's farmhand Raymond the hobo without a shotgun  is murdered watching the teens have sex (his death is off screen)  Tina's death is heavily cut!
Eddie on the other hand is rough and really creative but, also effective  his skull is crushed against a tree with a belt! This is one of those scenes that really upped the bar on graphic violence (I forgot if it was cut in any way the way the MPAA had it in for this sequel I'm sure it was)
 Then you have Reggie's big brother  Demon  played by the one and only Miguel N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Jr  (Also known for the Classic Return of the Living Dead and Juwanna Mann)  and another Famous WTF Scene
after Reggie and Pam leave  Demon's girl  Anita (Jere Fields who is a dead ringer for the chick in the Michael Jackson Thriller Music Video)  whips out a joint and ask him if he wants to hit this?  Now comes the infamous line  ""Those Damn Enchiladas"" and he runs to the outhouse epic in every possible way!
Then it gets even more wacky when  Anita and Damon starting singing to each other ""Ooh Babby"" while Miguel is still on the toilet!
The two are killed not much of a surprise.
Jason starts killing almost everyone
Ethel death is heavily edited
You come to one of the best dance scenes ever in any horror film with Violet doing the robot to a song called ""His Eyes""
This is just awesome  in every way the build up is great you have lightning effects going and the music it's really good!
Her death on the other hand was pulled back and cut big time
The thing I always hated about this film was (Violet, Robin and Jake being Killed all 3 were actually very likable and didn't deserve to die But, it's a bloody Friday film)
Another Great thing you have is Pam vs Jason
where Pam holding a Chainsaw going toe to toe with Jason and his machete!  You'd never see this again
**Spoilers**
Jason falls to his death into spikes!!! the mask flies off big reveal It's not Jason but Roy
Roy snapped after Joey's death Joey was Roy's son very much like the original Friday the 13th
It's a very slick twist that doesn't make complete sense though
Since Vic murdered Joey not the countless amount of people Roy killed
Vic was used as a  red herring but, so was Tommy for that matter it was smart misdirection
Pam goes to check on Tommy
Tommy hears Pam approaching and throws his bed through the window
Pam runs into the room Tommy pops out from behind the door wearing Roy's hockey mask and holding a knife and as the screen goes to black.......
This was meant to set Tommy up as the new Killer in The Friday The 13th Series
But, things didn't work out that way
One thing everyone should know up front this is a real grindhouse  style slasher film  long before the grindhouse  movement became this hip retro thing! This was in 1985 when VHS was becoming the norm in american homes and President Ronald Reagan was sucking on jellybeans.
It's sleazy and very dirty and tasteless But, it never once pretends it ain't......
Everyone after the fact acted surprised by the final product
They paid Danny Steinmann a good amount to co-write and direct But, they never looked at his previous work....
I call complete BS on anyone who says that! Even Frank Mancuso Jr threw Danny under the bus in that latest documentary.  Frank Mancuso Jr. is a typical cooperate suite who's so out of touch it's frighting.
The film is very much a mix between 1970's grindhouse sleaze & 1980's style
The cast is a real motley crue of various actors
Everyone has a strange part to play some characters have no real point in being there but, they show up and it works
This film is a great example while your under the influence of god knows what you can write  Insane trippy things
and it can be brilliant and still insane! Case in point Oliver Stones Natural Born Killers
This film was very much ahead of it's time  it tried to be a little to different and payed the price
It's much like the original Friday the 13th  a homage to Psycho But, with hardcore sex and death
the wikipedia page on this film is interesting.  But, who knows whats real and fake?
When you get down to it I see this film being like a Rocky Horror Picture Show at some point
Every horror fan has been demanding a uncut version of Friday the 13th part 7
I'd rather have a uncut rated X version of Friday the 13th Part 5
Part 5 was singled out and edited the most
The sex scene between Tina and Eddie was majorly cut down.  The scene itself ran around 8 minutes
All the gore and deaths were heavily edited
Violet death was changed from the original concept I forgot if the original death scene  was even filmed
Part 5 A New Beginning was beyond ambitious it was unique and brave!  It tried to do things differently and was sacrificed for it
  9.4/10

Friday the 13th part VI Jason Lives Blu Ray Disc Extras
Commentary by Director Tom McLoughlin (This was originally a exclusive from the Friday the 13th  box set  From Crystal Lake to Manhattan Ultimate Collection back  in 2004)
Commentary by Director Tom McLoughlin  w/cast and crew
Jason Lives: The making of Friday the 13th part VI (very cool mini Doc)
Meeting Mr. Voorhees (very cool to bad there was never footage shot)
Original Theatrical Teaser Trailer,
Lost Tales from Camp Blood part 6.
The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited part III  (These two extras really suck hated them on the deluxe edition dvd) i think this was just thrown onto the disc to pad it!
Gonna try this again Tried to update this review yesterday and a hr. worth of the review Never took

Jason Lives is the complete opposite of A new Beginning
I really wish Both Melanie Kinnaman (Pam) &  John Shepherd (Tommy) Returned to this film the two were signed on to do two more sequels But, since FT13 part V got such a unjustified trashing from fans and critics they went backwards and had to Re-introduce Jason to the 1980's Horror fans! but, find a way to keep Tommy around one more time
Jason Lives is  no way bad I grew up watching this flick  a lot
It's biggest problem IMO is where does this film fit into the time line?
Yes i know I'm bothered by a time line in a fictitious slasher series (What can i tell you)
But, where does it fit into the time line did FT13 part V never happen or did it (I listen to both commentaries a while back so I forgot if it's even brought up on either one)
The Setup is very great Tom McLoughlin is a unique director
The film is very Gothic Looking and different from any of the previous FT13 Films
The opening scenes with all the fog is a nice touch
Tommy escaped out of a Mental Asylum (which makes it look like 5 did in fact happen)  with Ron Palillo ""Horshack"" from Welcome Back, Kotter of all the people to run into while you have no shoe laces!  Odd casting but, looking back not as bad as Rob Zombie casting Micky Dolenz in the Halloween (2007) Re-make......................... Rob Zombie defenders please explain that to me
The blue pick-up truck which Tommy drives is the same truck that Pam drives in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning which is also very odd
Tommy now being played by the awesome Thom Mathews (also known for a little film Called Return of the Living Dead) I've always like Thom he too like so many of the actor/actress who worked on FT13th Series were in many ways black listed for doing any of these films and it's really sad and speaks volumes on how phony and fake Hollywood is!
Tommy and  Horshack go to the graveyard where Jason is buried. Dig up Jason's grave (I guess to make sure he still dead) which in a way proves A New Beginning did in fact happen! Once they see what's left of Jason in his Grave Tommy has a metal breakdown flips out  and puts a Metal Spike through Jason's Corpse at least 6 times
Which seems to make Tommy vent and release all his anger
Ooh yeah they dug him up to burn the body Cause Tommy makes a comment while driving to the graveyard Jason belongs in Hell Gonna make sure he gets there
Which is foreshadowing to Jason Goes to Hell
Tommy goes to get the gasoline so they can burn the body and maybe some marshmallows too
A Bolt of Lightning hits the spike which re-animates Jason and Brings him back to life
(Very Frankenstein Monster)  I Always loved this it's simple but, really hasn't been done much
It also looks very good Jason's Tombstone explodes (very cool)  even though i wish he's tombstone was unmarked that would've been more real and realistic The dude Butchered lots of People and they are gonna Put his name on a tombstone! No it would be a unmarked grave
Jason Lives is also the Introduction to the Supernatural Jason!
But, that also don't fit since he was killed at the end of part 3 ends up at the city Morgue at the start of part 4 (what was he then??)
whatever the case Jason gets out of the grave and you don't see much of his face due to the darkness you see a bit But, it's lacking any real Detail! Jason kills Horshack by ripping his heart out of his chest it's quick but, looks good Horshack's lifeless body falls into Jason Grave (which is  a nice touch) Tommy runs gets into his pick-up and drives out of there fast!
Jason grabs his mask from the Grave puts it on then comes The Strangest Opening to any FT13 Film
It does the old James Bond 007 Intro Instead of Bond Jason walks into the frame swings his machete blood squirts
and you get the title Card and credits (I've seen this film a lot I grew up with this film mostly due to a nutty older Brother who was Obsessed with FT13) Looking at this James Bond Parody now it's a little strange and to comical IMO
McLoughlin and Paramount wanted to do a film that was complete opposite of part 5
C.J. Graham plays Jason and he's very under-rated I can bank money Kane Hodder  watch C.J. performance and mimicked it when he took the role as Jason later on in the Series! C.J. was a Flawless Jason
Tommy makes it to the Local Police Station
and you meet Sheriff Garris (played by another under-rated actor David Kagen) always like him even though he looks like John Holmes  in this flick!
After the events of FT13 pt. 2-4
Crystal Lake had been renamed to Forest Green (That to is a smart idea)
This is also the first and only Friday Film with actual kids going to the Camp
Jason starts killing various people (Almost all the kills are very tame If this was put out now I think it would be PG-13) No Nudity, very little extreme deaths,  some language
It did things Scream would later lift/copy  It's maybe the first Slasher film that broke the fourth wall
Jennifer Cooke as Megan (She fit and holds her own)  Jennifer and Thom have good chemistry and it helps the story along
There are some interesting cool scenes
There's a group of Executives outside playing paintball which is Never really explained what these people are in the business world
3 of the paintballers are decapitated at the same time (it looks cool) super quick though
There is also a Iconic scene with Tom Fridley  (who is John Travolta nephew) get stabbed in the side of the head which causes him to wreck the RV he's driving  (which leads to a scene of Jason Breaking out of the top of the RV standing on it with the bottom on Fire! Looks really good

It's 86min. it's crazy how short this film is 'Cause so much happens in that short amount of time
The only thing i find strange about these double disc are Jason Goes to Hell & Jason X are nowhere to be found on a double disc set (New Line i guess won't play ball or the licensing agreement is done) From everything i've read Jason Goes to Hell in the BR Box Set is the Cut version Not the Director's Cut (it's rated X) Freddy vs Jason and the Horrid Friday the 13th Re-make are already on BR
So all you young found footage hipsters are safe!
$13.50 for a 2Disc set with lots of Extras you really can't go wrong
The only major problem with all these double BR Set you loose the very cool Deluxe Edition Slip Cases all the FT13 Films had on dvd (It was 3-D art the Art on almost all were very good) Keep in mind this is Pre Scream Factory a major studio doing this was a little odd especially when you consider how much Paramount has Always loathed the Friday the 13th Series and it's fans!",1438041600,4,19348,4.3381374722838135

7346493,5,B012BYDK90,"Oh, well. Guess it's a New Beginning. Paramount had decided to end the Friday the 13th franchise twice, once with Part III and then again with the Final Chapter. But there was money to be made and so here we are. First, Jason only appears in hallucinations or dream sequences for our main character Tommy Jarvis. That's right, Jason kills no one in this movie!

So Tommy, the surviving kid from Final Chapter, has spent years in a mental hospital and now he is being transitioned back into society by living in a group home. Doesn't take long before people start biting the dust. The identity of the killer comes out of left field, as you only see that character for 2 small scenes early on. You kinda have to try to remember who it is exactly. I think they could have ran with this and made the series about whoever puts on a Jason mask becomes like Jason and kills to avenge their personal loss.

But the producers chickened out and instead we get Part VI. It's not a bad movie but at this point you're just rooting for Jason to kill. The story isn't relevant at all. Halloween IV took the exact same route as Friday VI. Disappointing. As for the blu ray, this is about as good as it will ever get for this series, picture wise, considering how cheap Paramount is when it comes to the Friday series.

R.I.P. to Danny Steinmann the director of New Beginning who passed away recently. This was the last movie he ever made.",1469577600,2,1422,4.399239543726236

7346495,5,B012BYDK90,"Outstanding! For this packaging of the Friday the 13th movies, they are put on the same disc! All features, everything carried over and maybe more from the Deluxe DVD editions. I have all the DVD Deluxe Editions for the 8 films Paramount did and there are more features on the Blu-ray Deluxe Editions. Perhaps due to space availability? I doubt it. For instance, Part 3 DVD edition has fewer ""extras"" than it's Blu-ray Deluxe counterpart.
Well, they all look good now and am very happy to have these. I did not get the tin package with Jason on the front cover. Every time I wanted to get one, it was dented or dinged up on the shelf. No thanks if I am going to spend 80 bucks or so on that and from what I have heard from other reviewers, it was a horrible package job.
This set is pretty good. Mid '80s. 1985/1986.
Special Features are identical to the Blu-rays that were released before in the special set or individually. Although, I have parts 1-3 individually, the rest I don't think were released that way on Blu-ray.
If you don't have the Friday the 13th parts V and VI, THIS is the way to GET THEM. Well done Paramount on this release!! Thank you!

7346505,5,B012BYDK90,"FINALLY!!! I love the first 6 Friday the 13th movies, 7 is okay and the rest can burn, and I was able to get parts 1&2/3&4 as Bluray double bills last year on sale, brand new, for $20 along with Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions. I didn't want the Matrix sequels and wished that Friday the 13th 5&6 had been out. Well, I'm glad that someone realized what a great idea it is to put the rest of the old school F13th movies out as double bills. I'm even tempted to get 7&8. Good job to whoever did this.",1442448000,,494,4.15625

8725861,4,B012BYDK90,"Rating this one a bit lower as Warner Brothers did a shoddy job on all of these blu-rays, and just hoping they'll treat them with a little more respect when/if they are reissued. The Danny Steinmann commentary on Part V is awful. He over talks the other folks on the commentary with stupid, unrelated comments - and you'll likely only ever listen to that once. I always liked Part V, but it's definitely one of the weaker entries. however, the Part 6 segment of the disc is great! In comparison, I think it is one of the strongest entries, and that segment of the disc is well put together. It may have been better served as an entirely separate disc, but it's fairly inexpensive and nice to at least have both of them on blu. Maybe hold for a Blu-ray reissue down the road, but Part VI only, unless you are a Friday completest (as I am).",1498521600,,838,4.343949044585988

8725864,2,B012BYDK90,"the quality of the DVD to the Blu ray is almost identical, because they basically packed the contents of both DVD releases to a single bluray disc (without the DVD compression), but the HD doesn't look High Def at all; smaller space for each film (because of the single disc), thus overall diminished quality.

Not worth the money, I love these movies, but the DVDs are just as good and much cheaper.

Honestly, whoever owns the home release rights to this franchise needs to get their sh*t together and put out blu ray sets and single movie releases, etc.",1492992000,,556,4.606060606060606
