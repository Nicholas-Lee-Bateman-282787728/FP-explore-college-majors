8543433,1,B009OWA6Y0,"ALIVE - Rick Springfield is a PIRATED copy of Greatest Hits: ALIVE by Rick Springfield! The picture on the front of this ALIVE DVD/CD is NOT even Rick! Once you open the case and see the DVD of the ALIVE, it's obvious that it isn't the real DVD version! (I didn't open mine when I got it - so now I'm stuck with this PIRATED copy) Check to see what the cover of the REAL version looks like then look at the cover of this one! TOTAL SCAM! I'm a very dedicated RS fan but I wasn't paying attention to the cover when I bought mine and by the time I realized it is PIRATED, it was too late to return it. I can't believe Amazon stocks and ships this! obviously then don't care if something is PIRATED! Check the cover and the title - NOT Rick and NOT ""Greatest Hits: ALIVE"" The picture attached is the REAL one",1513814400,,805,4.069182389937107
