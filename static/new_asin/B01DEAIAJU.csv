7711817,5,B01DEAIAJU,"Gabriel and Elias are brothers, but they look nothing like each other save for a hair lip. Gabriel is a down at heart professor and Elias is a man who has a way with the ladies  the wrong one that is and a need for a lot of tension relief. They are both a bit odd  to say the least.

Then their father pops his clogs (well the film is Danish) and leaves the boys a VHS message. In it they discover that he is not their biological father and that their real daddy lives on some remote island and is a bit of a scientist or something. Anyway with no time left to lose the lads decide they have to trace their real family  and so the fun begins.

Now this has some belly laugh moments and Mads Mikkelsen seems to relish the role. Then so does everyone else too and it must have been great fun to make. It is a pretty dark comedy in places but it also has a fair smattering of slapstick too. There is also a great story with lots of fun, truisms and heart. Written by Anders Thomas Jensen who brought us Green Butchers and many more  this is one of those films that you will tell your friends is a must see.",1472083200,4,1103,3.9909090909090907

7711823,5,B01DEAIAJU,"Terrific movie, funny, bizarre, and underneath it all very heartwarming. It has a black sense of humor that the Danes are famous for. Mads Mikkelsen is unbelievable. Bad perm, cheesy mustache, cleft lip and a chronic masturbator, a man who wants his brother's love and a women, any women. This is the 4th film that Mads has done with writer/directer Anders Thomas Jensen and they work wonderfully together. Weird, and probably not for everyone but if you love Mads Mikkelsen you will love this movie. The man is an amazing actor, this role is so far removed from that of Hannibal Lecter it is a testimony to his acting skills. All the other Danish actors in this film are equally excellent. This movie is in Danish and has subtitles, I found watching it a second time added more to understanding the dialogue, those Danes really talk fast!",1468540800,11,839,4.714285714285714

7711830,5,B01DEAIAJU,"A bizarre, weird and ultimately wonderful movie.  I keep thinking about it and laughing to myself wondering what off-the-hook mind came up with this premise and how they pulled it off. Mads was hilarious and all the characters really dove into their parts creating a singularly fascinating movie. Granted it's not for everyone, but was one of the first Danish films I watched and it led me to watch many more to experience the Dane's particular sense of humor and pathos.",1510358400,,471,4.814814814814815

7711835,5,B01DEAIAJU,"Hilarios, but seriously Dark Humor. If you are looking for a simple Adam Sandler movie to giggle at, or a Coen brother's style gross out, this movie is not for you. If, however, you enjoy dark humor, a little schadenfreude, and some seriously cringey circumstances, then you will LOVE this film. I don't want to give anything away, but from start to finish, there are moments that seem so absurd that you can't help but laugh, yet the plot (and the storytelling itself) holds it's own, and your interest is piqued all the way until the highly improbable and gloriously insane end. Highly Recommend.",1492473600,5,598,4.759615384615385

It takes some getting used to but I was totally engrossed after the brothers meet each other and the fun really begins. This had a wonderful cast that gave life, grins, and solid laughs to what otherwise could have been a pretty mediocre movie. I highly recommend this movie and will be pushing it on my friends every chance I get!",1480982400,3,468,4.390804597701149

7711855,4,B01DEAIAJU,I understand why some reviewers didn't rate this movie very highly. The first 20 minutes I almost turned it off several times. Glad I persevered. It's a sad but sweet story of brotherhood and acceptance. The description for the movie said something about casting Mads against type which I thought was rather strange... what type is that? Mads has played a very broad range of characters in his career and this is just another example of his great acting capabilities. Recommended if you enjoy movies a little off the beaten track.,1478649600,4,530,4.835164835164835
7711856,3,B01DEAIAJU,"Men & Chicken is a dark slapstick comedy about socially challenged siblings Gabriel (David Dencik) and Elias (Mads Mikkelsen, TVs Hannibal), who discover in their late fathers videotaped will that they are adopted half-brothers. Their journey in search of their biological father takes them to the small Danish island of Ork, where they stumble upon three additional half-brothers  each also sporting hereditary harelips and lunatic tendencies  living in a dilapidated mansion overrun by barn animals. Initially unwelcome by their newfound kin, the two visitors stubbornly wear them down until they're reluctantly invited to stay. As the misfit bunch get to know each other, they discover a deep family secret that ultimately draws them closer.

Danish writer/director Anders Thomas Jensen creates a weird, almost surreal atmosphere with the movies grotesque visual style and unusual production design. One memorable sequence shows the results of botched attempts at taxidermy. The film attempts to be a fable about humanism and tolerance, but there is considerable emphasis on sexuality and cruel slapstick that makes the theme seen half-hearted and glib. Ultimately, the movie settles into sentimental horror when the family secret is revealed.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a 24-page booklet with a detailed behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, and trailers. A digital copy is enclosed. The film is in Danish, with English subtitles.",1477440000,2,1480,5.535398230088496
7711857,4,B01DEAIAJU,"This is one crazy, bizarre movie!  Very well acted and compelling.  I watched it because Mads Mikkelson was starring, and he rarely disappoints. This is no exception. I won't ruin the story by giving a synopsis, but I will say that the ending is pretty weak. That said, I still highly recommend the film, if for no other reason you will not likely ever see anything of its kind again.",1477267200,,384,4.4714285714285715
7711858,1,B01DEAIAJU,"Love, love Mads Mikelson....but what the hell was going on in this movie? It was really funny and endearing here and there but as time progressed it got darker and more sadistic...am embarrassed I now own this film.",1476316800,2,215,4.684210526315789

7711861,5,B01DEAIAJU,"Aside fro everything else, this must have been the set dresser's dream, let alone the animal wrangler's.  If you can't live with subtitles, pass this up.  Then there are the detailed examples of squalor, episodes of urgent masturbation, cleft lips all around, cheese making in inappropriate locations and a stork with a cleft lip and tiny little bare human feet, a corpse that has been left in repose for many years, distressing the brothers because they think that it prevents visits from girls and resulting sexual adventures.  The least of it, you can be sure.  Mads Mikkelsen has a perm.  If you are still up for viewing this, you will probably have a good time.  I did... so many moments of hilarity!

The Danish film makers are masters at comically championing the misfit.  They can coax you into opening your heart to an array of individuals who have drifted beyond the edges of a workable culture.  Of all that I have seen and thoroughly loved of this sort, ADAM'S APPLES-FLICKERING LIGHTS- MIFUNE'S LAST SONG, MEN AND CHICKENS brings us beyond the beyond of those edges.

Mads Mikklesen.  This is another example of his very broad acting skills.",1475798400,8,1154,4.807106598984771

7711864,5,B01DEAIAJU,"How many movies can rightfully claim that they are truly unique? With famed Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen at the helm, Men & Chicken(s) is a super-imaginative amalgam of Dr. Moreau-style science fiction and slapstick comedy, with (especially at the end) a big dose of pathos. It creates a singularly powerful atmosphere all of its own, with its own quirky rules.

7711870,4,B01DEAIAJU,"What a weird movie. Don't expect to watch a comedy or dark comedy, as it is advertised on the web. The film deals with many taboos and silences in society (violence, academic arrogance, masturbation, impacts of science, masculinity, mental illness). The more you think about the story, the more topics come up. You may want to laugh about some of the scenes, just to find yourself gagging at the next moment. This is a very heavy and bitter satire of society, not so different from one of Mikkelsen's previous movie, Adam's Apple. Please, watch it and draw your own conclusions.",1474416000,,578,4.79
