8153205,5,B000JU9L06,"Admittedly not a film for everyone, this is a superb documentary to show the life of the displaced and persecuted afghani group called the Hazara.  The Taliban killed them and destroyed their homes.  So it came to be that one family amongst many other refugees came to be living in a cave near the destroyed giant Buddha statue in Baniyam.

Our director is a British documentary film maker, who went there in 2002 to film the devastation of not only the statue but the town and all its buildings.  There he met a cute boy of eight who was irrrepressibly cheerful and curious.  His name was Mir.  That may be short for Amir but it could also be Russian for ""peace"".

Mir is a delight to watch. He is such a happy kid and smiling constantly.  The father and new wife, with daughter and new husband, are in dire poverty amongst the dust and rocks.  At first no one appears to work at all.  The women never go out and a job seems impossible for them.  Mir's father looks old and weatherbeaten,  and he is crippled from a rock slide on his back.  The new son in law is a shirker and a shiner, but eventually gets hard labor jobs like brick making and breaking up trees for firewood.  Overall things are grim.  The boy seems to be wearing second hand European clothes such as a ski overall and a synthetic fiber sweater, popular in the 1980's in Germany.

Mir is the star of this film, spread out over a year so that we may see the seasons of the year.  The cold snowy harsh winter is grim indeed.  He does go to school and applies himself steadfastly with a dream of becoming a teacher.  Schools and parents use corporate punishment.  Girls are covered up and chastised as being impure if they want to see or do anything beyond the confines of the home.  Mir dreams of marriage and children one day.  It is the father who will pick a wife for him.

Why is the film compelling?  It is such a stark contrast to our western lives yet the family is very real.  They complain about each other and criticize each other yet you can see they are bound to each other and help each other.  The boy Mir shows in his spirit that he is loved.  He soon gains a niece and adores the new baby.  In such misery these people dream of more children.

If you do find any of this interesting, you can also see Boy Mir.  That was a subsequent film done ten years later to show Mir's progress and how he becomes a man.  A true Shiite. His once smiling almost European face grows hard and dusty and resolute and tough.

Such amazing and darling children... many Hazara moved to Australia as refugees.  They descen from the Mongols of Genghis Khan and were second class citizens under the Pashtu afghans.  See The Kite Runner.  They were often servants and doing real grunt work.

Hope all of you will at least watch some of it.  See the boy give a tour of the bombed out royal rooms of those cliffs!",1487203200,,2870,4.297196261682243

8153207,5,B000JU9L06,I have quite a few documentaries from Seventh Art Productions and have never been disappointed.  That trend continues with The Boy Who Plays on the Buddhas of Bamiyan.  It is a brutally honest look at one year in the life of a boy living in war-torn Afghanistan.,1360368000,,262,4.553191489361702
8153208,5,B000JU9L06,"A truly moving documentary about a young boy called Mir living among the ruins of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan. Mir is so charismatic and a joy to watch and is always smiling despite everything he and his family have been through. I have yet to see the recently rleased ""Buddhas Collapsed out of Shame"" which has also received great reviews but I would really recommend watching ""The Boy who Plays on the Buddhas of Bamiyan"" You can make a donation to Mir at [...]
The follow-up is currently in development so I'm really looking forward to it being released.",1233792000,3,567,4.623762376237623
8153209,3,B000JU9L06,"""The boy who plays on the Buddhas of Bamiyan"", directed by Phil Grabsky, is a good documentary that manages to be interesting, beautiful and sad at the same time.

This film documents three seasons (summer, winter and autumn) in the life of a small family of refugees that lives in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in the caves close to the Buddhas that the Taliban blew up in March 2001. Grabsky lets us see how they struggle to survive, and how they get by with very little, pinning most of their hopes for the future in their small son, a cheeky eight-year-old called Mir Hussain.

The scenery of Bamiyn is breathtaking, but the everyday reality of this family, and thousands just like it, is extremely harsh. Some commentaries regarding life under the rule of the Taliban made by the older family members throw some light on that period, but I would have appreciated learning more about the subject, either in the documentary or in some kind of bonus feature that this dvd doesn't have.

Despite that, I found this documentary engaging, and I cannot help but be curious regarding what happened to Mir and his family. After visiting this film's website, [...], I learnt that Phil Grabsky is working on a documentary that tells what happens to them. I will try to watch it, too.

All in all, I believe that ""The boy who plays on the Buddhas of Bamiyan"" is well-worth seeing. Recommended...

8153210,5,B000JU9L06,"I happened upon the last half of this film late one night. The next day I ordered this DVD and went to the Web site of The Boy Who Plays On the Buddhas of Bamiyan.

Never in my life have I been so moved, overwhelmed, and just plain shaken-up as I was after watching this incredible film on daily life in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. The news media never illuminates the human truth of situations such as the reality of life in Afghanistan - the conditions of life in war-ravaged areas of the world.

The central character of the film is Mir Hussain, a young boy who lives among the rubble of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Mir is the epitome of the unconquerable human spirit. He radiates happiness and curiosity in a world that is unimaginable to most of us. Mir's family, friends and neighbors move from day to day with hope that their conditions will improve. Through their eyes and stories, we learn of an existence that most of us could not previously comprehend.

Mir's joyous, larger-than-life personality never stops shining. This film will touch you as no other film has. He shows us that happiness is only dependent upon the human spirit and how that spirit is able to transcend surroundings and obstacles. It breaks my heart each time I watch the film, yet Mir brings a smile through the tears.

The Director, Phil Grabsky, is a true spiritual leader in this ""modern"" age, although he may not describe himself the same way. An amazing degree of personal courage, bravery, vision and compassion were required to create this extraordinary film. A great work that will always serve as a guide to each of us to live a more fulfilling life by raising our awareness and teaching us to get involved.

Grabsky has beautifully captured a grand life-lesson - that Mir and his family make us actually feel how far we have strayed from what is truly important in life: taking care of each other, supporting each other and those less fortunate than we are.

This award-winning film illuminates the life of Mir and his family, and focuses attention on this humanitarian need - for us to contribute to the welfare of the people in Bamiyan. This film is truly a beacon of light in a world of mass materialism and pre-dominant unhappiness. How far from truth and gratitude we are.

Will this film have the power to propel us to act; to provide housing, food, water, clothing, medication and education to the people of Bamiyan? Yes, it has the power and Grabsky has shown us the way. The highest praise to Grabsky for opening our eyes and hearts to the reality of the situation in Afghanistan.

Own this film, visit the website, support the work of Phil Grabsky, and donate your assistance to the people of Bamiyan. Everyone should have a copy of this film, if only to remind us of our humanity.",1194393600,6,2774,4.612576064908722
