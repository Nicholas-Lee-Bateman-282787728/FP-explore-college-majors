2267585,4,B00095MBO4,"The sensual feminine art/dance of stripping is amazing. How to begin? Inhibitions have you captive? Playfully and skillfully work your way into sensuality from simple everyday garb such as a sweat suit or step out of a beautiful wedding gown!

Before embarking on your ""naughty"" journey, rest assured, Jo Weldon guides you into the art of striptease for your own exotic dance pleasure or burlesque career. Before you take it all off, Jo Weldon enlightens her viewer with an interesting background and short history, details on resources, book lists and references on striptease. Tips for a stage name are mentioned as well.

Each routine or ""theories"" are great tips for mastering items as, those hard to reach zippers, whether using a tassel or just reaching back and playfully opening out of a dress, pencil skirt, or evening gown, here is the key! The music is fantastic and so saucy and alluring. The program is open level and user friendly. Ms. Weldon is candid and skillfully represents her art. So, feel beautiful and love the skin you're in and prepare!

Some of the stripping routines taught in this program are:
 Sweat suit with hoodie: playfully removing sneakers, socks, pants while seated in a chair
Lingerie:  very cute routine. Learn how to remove a bra, using shoulder rolls, and yes removing panties and using a cute little kick to send them out of the way
Skirt and blouse practice with three sections, slipping out of a shirt, or skirt, very playful
Evening gown: flirtatious and very, very sexy
The men's clothing routine: fun, playful and sexy. This routine is so cute, performed in a fedora, men's underwear, shirt, tie, socks and garter socks, with heels.
A section on removing ""over the knee"" boots and jeans skillfully

If you want dance moves to add to your strip tease, Jo Weldon has 2 fantastic burlesque programs.""Honey and Spice"", and ""Silk and Feathers"", which includes dancing with props such as,large ostrich and marabou fans, silk fans. All these enhance and add drama to stripping.
There are no voice cues or music only sections but its easy to follow along or simply sit and be entertained.
A few distracting items about the program I felt were too much unnecessary detail before each routine about what she's going to do. The mention of the sponsors that contributed to the program seemed repetititious,  since  they are already mentioned in the credits section. Aside from these minor items, the program is entertaining and the tips are easy to learn.",1262304000,26,2489,4.90952380952381
2267586,5,B00095MBO4,"I have one of her other dvds and it was also informative and entertaining.
In this one she gives tips and suggestions you might not normally think about when stripping. Such as the skin having an electrical
charge that can be transfered to the viewer etc....
I liked the psychology behind stripping and have new material to practice with and I especially like her stripper quote that "" when you take off your earrings you mean business.""
Highly recommended.",1260576000,4,457,4.7974683544303796

2267588,2,B00095MBO4,"The music and style is very very old style... like in the beginning of 1900s.  I did not like it at all.  Slow, old, not sexy at all.",1399248000,4,133,3.7142857142857144
2267589,5,B00095MBO4,I love it!  They make feeling sexy very easy.  My husband liked my little dance too.  I can develop confidence to tease my husband.,1393632000,,131,4.375
2267590,4,B00095MBO4,"This DVD is great! The format can be a bit awkward, and I wish there were more links to the things she talks about in the videos, but overall this DVD is extremely informative when it comes to the basics of stripping for a partner (or just for yourself!). It cleared up for me a lot of the mysteries between removing difficult clothing items, and really gives you a base from which to grow. My advice would be to watch it all the way through, then try it every chance you get!",1311033600,2,476,4.184782608695652
2267591,3,B00095MBO4,Its very interesing. The techniques are simple to learn. The only drawback would be that the instructor tends to be a little long winded.,1305072000,,137,4.75
2267592,5,B00095MBO4,"There is allot of information and depth in this DVD but the understanding will come better with repetition and practice if this is not a natural dance for you, Jo is a great place to start.",1287619200,,189,4.277777777777778
2267593,5,B00095MBO4,"What a GREAT DVD!!!  Jo explains exactly what she's going to do prior to showing you a full routine, and with grace, charm, and Va Va Voom!  I'm preparing myself to start dating, and wanted to ""Get my Sexy back"", and I'm on my way with the use of this DVD.  I've also recommended it to a girlfriend like myself, that's getting ready to date again.

What's truely wonderful about this DVD (which there are many FABULOUS aspects about it) is that you learn to make ANYTHING you're wearing or doing, SEXY. After watching a few routines, I pause the DVD to get a glass of ice tea.  As I walked into my kitchen, I caught myself walking SEXY....WoW this is FUN!  It Feels Good to Feel Sexy!!!  Buy this DVD, you'll love it!!!!!!!!",1280534400,8,724,4.358208955223881
2267594,4,B00095MBO4,"Jo's other DVD's were all about the choreography, the dance moves, the fun of the fans and sensuality of the feminine form.  This DVD is all about how to take clothes off. Jo, again is so delightful to watch.  But if you are looking for more dance then you should get ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-and-Spice-Sensual-and-Fierce-Burlesque/dp/B001QD09Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey and Spice: Sensual and Fierce Burlesque</a>"" however, if you have that and want to know how to take your dress/jeans/track pants off with an audience then this is the one.",1267142400,9,602,6.070588235294117
2267595,5,B00095MBO4,"Since antiquity (think Salome!) women have been stripping, and one of the things that makes this DVD fascinating as well as fabulous is Jo Weldon's history of the art of striptease and her detailed explanations of so many aspects of it, from the burlesque traditions to strip joints. Jo even talks about how to choose a name for yourself that is unique, and adds that ""when you take your earrings off, you mean business.""

Unlike Jo's earlier DVDs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-and-Spice-Sensual-and-Fierce-Burlesque/dp/B001QD09Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey and Spice: Sensual and Fierce Burlesque</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silk-and-Feathers-Burlesque-Fan-Dance/dp/B001LWBLWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silk and Feathers: Burlesque Fan Dance</a>&nbsp;which required special costumes, this DVD is so terrific because it uses readily available clothing, that you might have in your closet, and shows us how to make the most of it. The outfits she uses are:
Sweat pants, hoodie and T-shirt
3 skirt and blouse outfits
Dress and evening gown
Men's clothes
Jeans, long boots and turtleneck sweater (all difficult clothes to remove)
Garter belt and stockings explained and demonstrated
Business suit
Wedding dress

Among her many credits, Jo Weldon is headmistress of the New York School of Burlesque, and really knows her art. All you need for a prop is an ordinary straight-backed chair, and an appreciation of the human body.  Music is by Debra, Ronnie Magri, and J.C. Hopkins, and fits the practice sessions well. One of the best things about striptease, and it is not a gender specific art either, is that one can have tremendous fun with it. So go through your closet for some nifty clothes, put on this DVD, and enjoy!",1267056000,15,1838,6.00763358778626
2267596,5,B00095MBO4,"Jo Weldon is the best burlesque teacher out there today.  She has spent years studying and collecting information from the legends, as well as perfecting the art from her personal experience as a performer.  She explains everything wonderfully and makes you feel comfortable with her, even through the TV.  I highly recommend this DVD, as well as her other DVDs, and the classes she teaches at The New York School of Burlesque.",1262304000,8,427,4.902777777777778

8057395,5,B00095MBO4,"Gotta love Jo! She is cute, spunky and so very informative. I watched her DVDs, I have 4 of them and was very pleased with every single one. She has a handbook to burlesque. It was wonderful!! Rich in history, experience and advice. She is honest and is not shy to explain the best moves for your shape. If your larger, smaller, large breast or not. These DVDs will help you feel comfortable in your own skin. With confidence, we all can accomplish our goals with class and grace. If you are a house wife aspiring stripper, if only in the bedroom or a dancer wanting to explore other genres of dance. These are the best out there.

I started reading the handbook  2 week into my 10 week burlesque class I took on the west coast. Once I read it, I felt so much more comfortable and informed with what the instructors were teaching and now when I watch others perform. I have never met Jo or been on the east coast but if I ever visit, I know where I am heading!",1427500800,2,960,4.211956521739131
