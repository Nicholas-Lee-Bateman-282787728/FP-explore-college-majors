South Solitary is a 2010 production, and is a period drama, set in 1927 on a remote lighthouse island named South Solitary. Otto plays Meredith Appleton, a 35-year-old single woman who accompanies her uncle, George Wadsworth. Mr. Wadsworth has come to replace the deceased Head Lighthouse Keeper who apparently committed suicide. The island is barely populated - there are two assistant keepers, the taciturn Jack Fleet (Marton Csokas who was also in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Asylum/dp/B000BNX4MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Asylum</a>) and Harry Stanley (Rohan Nichol).

Meredith is a friendly, light-hearted sort of woman, and tries to make friends with Stanley's wife, the cold Alma (Essie Davis), who rebuffs Meredith's friendly overtures. Alma seems to be bogged down by the bleak and solitary island life, caring for her three rambunctious children. In desperation, Meredith accepts the romantic overtures of Harry, craving some form of human affection, given her own uncle's distance and coldness toward her. This leads to a series of catastrophic events, leaving Meredith alone and fending for herself, with only the strangely reticent ex-soldier Fleet for company.

The cinematography is gorgeous, conveying the rugged beauty of the remote island, and providing a breathtaking backdrop for the main character's own isolation and desperate loneliness. The subtle romance that blossoms later in the movie unfolds gently, allowing for the development of not only Meredith's character but also Fleet who reveals much more to his personality as the movie moves along. South Solitary is a slow-moving human drama, yet rewards the patient viewer with a fine exploration of the nuances of human emotions and relationships.",1316476800,9,1942,5.670103092783505
