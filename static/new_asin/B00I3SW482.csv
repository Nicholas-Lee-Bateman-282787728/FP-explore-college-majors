6248557,5,B00I3SW482,"I saw Every Everything at a film festival, featuring Q&A with Hart and director Bechard followed by a 45 minute live performance by Hart and 3 regional musician friends.  The entire package was captivating, but the centerpiece was Bechard's film.

I'd not been a Husker Du fan (and to this day don't understand what some of it was all about, and I'm in the industry), but the way Hart tells his story and, more importantly, the way Bechard stays out of the way of that telling, makes this film a captivating insight into almost everything about Hart, from the time he was 13 years old playing in dance bands to his current musical and personal endeavors.

Hart tells his story without the bile, rancor or bitterness that might be expected, but he's very clear about his intentions.

If the era, the band or Mr. Hart have any interest to you I strongly suggest this film.  If you see Grant on the film-fest circuit, ask him about his Studebaker restoration projects.  :)",1407628800,6,969,4.637426900584796
6248558,5,B00I3SW482,"Excellent expose of one of the most important songwriters in American music. Bechard lets Grant Hart tell his stories directly to the camera without inserting interviews by other artists and musicians. Hart is candid, uninterrupted and focused in the interviews and provides a different perspective on the disintegration of Husker Du. Bechard's approach to the making of this film allows Grant Hart the public voice he has long deserved, especially after being overshadowed by his former bandmates success all these years. A must see film for anyone interested in REAL American music.",1404086400,5,584,5.358695652173913
6248559,5,B00I3SW482,"Greetings,

And yes, his hipster rant is as great as you think it might be!

And secondly...

""Every Everything"" grew out of my desire to once again, after ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Replacements-Color-Me-Obsessed-A-Film-About-The-Replacements/dp/B00AD85EDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements</a>,"" to do a different take on the rock doc genre. I am a huge fan of Errol Morris, and love his ""Fog Of War"" in which he lets one man, and one man only, speak for 100 plus minutes. I kept thinking this would be a great format for a rock doc. But what rock star could sustain a 90 minute conversation? What rock star could keep his ego in check, and really open up, really take us on a journey through his life?

Now we had already interviewed Grant Hart for ""Color Me Obsessed,"" so I knew he was a great interview. But it wasn't until Grant and I shared a table for breakfast in Brussels (when both he and ""Color Me"" were playing the same Minneapolis homage show) that I knew he would be the perfect subject for this format. Not only had he seen and done almost everything in rock and roll, he possesses a brilliant mind, and he's a great freakin' story-teller.

But even my co-producer Jan Radder and I would hardly be prepared for the brilliance Grant brought to the table during our couple of weeks of filming in the Twin Cities. He laid it all on the line, and hopefully I have done his story justice.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for hopefully seeking out the film.

8638900,4,B00I3SW482,"Hart does an astonishing job of expressing complicated ideas and emotions. He's articulate as they come.

Lot's of surprises in this documentary. Here's just a couple:

On the upside: Since this documentary was made after Bob Mould published his autobiography (which I think is a bit of a ""tell-all"" when it comes to Hart) I figured Hart would take the opportunity to take a jab or two at Mould; but as it turned out, he was actually quite civil on that subject matter and spent very little time discussing him. All Hart said was that Mould inspired him as a musician more than anyone else and that he ""loved"" him -- and then it was on to a different topic.

On the downside: I was very disappointed that Hart spent very little time dissecting his songs, whether they were from his Husker Du, Nova Mob, or solo catalogs. For example, he knocked the second Nova Mob album as his most disappointing; but in regard to detail, all he said was that he liked the horns in ""Shoot Your Way To Freedom,"" which leaves his audience believing what? That everything else on the album sucked?* At the very least, I expected a substantial list of his favorite Husker songs. But who do you blame for all of this? The interviewee or the interviewer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Personally, I think ""Old Empire,"" ""Shoot Your Way To Freedom,"" ""Little Miss Information,"" and ""If I Was Afraid/Coda"" range in quality from very good to excellent.",1511568000,,1521,5.092369477911647
8638901,5,B00I3SW482,"Fabulous. A must watch for any old school Husker Du fan. Funny, Sad, and Hopeful. Many thanks to Gorman Bechard for helping to shine light on a man whose work has flown criminally under the radar for too many years.",1422057600,5,215,4.4
8638902,5,B00I3SW482,"Grant Hart is a fascinating subject and all-around great storyteller. This film makes you feel like you are having a one-on-one personal visit with him. Especially wonderful are the ""extras."" Honestly, give this brilliant man a topic, wind him up, and off he goes! Being a fan as well as a friend, I'm afraid I'm not exactly unbiased. Still, this film is well worth the investment if you ever had any questions whatsoever about Grant Hart.",1417910400,4,439,4.7894736842105265
8638903,5,B00I3SW482,A very derserved documentary for a semi-forgotten underground rock legend. Grant Harts life has been something of a difficult internal struggle. The first time I watched this doco I came away with a feeling of sadness. There seemed to be alot of loneliness within him. But maybe that had something to do with him being the only person being interviewed for the camera. But the second time I watched I caught more of his humour and unique way of observing the things that have happend to him. He is quite candid and open about his relationships with his family and former bandmates (especially Bob Mould) in Husker Du and his relationship with William Burroughs. He talks at decent length about each of his albums and his artwork. It's great to see that someone cared enough to give Hart the recognition he has always been worthy of. If you appreciate Grant Hart and his amazing musical legacy you should really see this. I give it 5 stars!!!!!,1415664000,7,943,4.686746987951807
8638904,4,B00I3SW482,"I've never seen a rock doc like this before.  Now I understand the Fog of War reference: Grant Hart is the only voice.  And honestly he's the only voice we need.  This is a vast, at times depressing, at times driving, story of one man's journey through everything rock and roll has to offer.  And just when you think the snarky Hart is going to say something to make you hate him, he instead says something so damn smart, you just find yourself nodding along with the guy.  Thoroughly entertaining.  And I am not really a Husker Du fan.",1414108800,,536,4.363636363636363
8638905,3,B00I3SW482,"Husker Du is one of my favorite bands so anything like this that comes out, I am interested in. While I enjoyed it, it felt too insular because Grant Hart is the only person in this documentary. There are no other people or views except Grant's. And while what he says is interesting, there was no balance or challenge. The Husker bio that came out a few years ago had a number of easy to check factual errors which was unfortunate. For some reason I can't put my finger on, I feel a similarity with this doc.

Hart talks about his child and realizing he's not good at being a dad. He then says if his child is angry; ""He didn't get it from me"". He's clearly in denial that by not being in his child's life, whether he feels he good at being a dad or not, any anger isn't in part his responsibility. I would've liked to see him questioned on this but the doc doesn't take any chances on challenging what Hart says. Aahh! That's what it is. The filmmakers made a rose-colored glass of a doc that don't upset its subject. Not a way to make a good doc.

Overall worthwhile from a Husker/Hart fan point of view but not as good on a personal level on the part of the filmmakers. There was no challenge to this artist who likes challenge. They handled him with kid gloves and it could've been much more. Maybe questions were asked but left out. I would've liked other people in it for balance.",1412380800,8,1387,4.25
8638906,5,B00I3SW482,"What may be the greatest documentary of all times. Grant Hart may be unknown to you but if you watch this you will at the very least like him as a human being. This FILM is an accomplishment - an accomplishment of originality. It throws away the formula and reinvents it. Very few films change the way other films are made- this is one of them. Genius -simply genius. If you are a film student, a fan of film, a Husker Du fan, a music fan, a drummer, or a human being you will relate to this film on many levels. This is one of those films that is original .",1411862400,5,558,4.036036036036036
8638907,5,B00I3SW482,Excellent!,1411344000,4,10,10.0
8638908,5,B00I3SW482,It is one of the great injustices of this world that Grant Hart is not as well known as Bob Mould. hopefully this documentary can make that up. I not only have more faith in my own judgment over these last 50 years towards art and music but it becomes clear that he is operating on a different playing field. I knew them but haven't seen any of them since that last tour in 87 in DC. I did get the chance to spend some social time with the band and although I didn't see Bob (he was with Tommy Keene somewhere) that night-I will say that Grant and Greg were as nice as they get-they were far more considerate thankful and mature minded than 90% of the ego driven bozos that came thru DC (and lived there actually). I love this guy. I really do and I hope the world rewards him for his singular vision. His music the band and his artistic vision still inspire and lets hope the world remains kind to this gentleman.  Give his new stuff a chance-it is really strong. Thanks for making this-I will cherish it forever.,1410393600,6,1014,4.22680412371134
8638909,5,B00I3SW482,"I was an original backer of this project and already received a ""screener"" of this incredible documentary. I am a huge Grant Hart fan, but this is better than anything I could have imagined.  It speaks volumes that I re-purchased this version just so I could get the extra  2 hours of brilliant interview footage.  This disc is worth every penny and more for anyone who every interested in 80's alternative rock, or just excellent documentaries. The subject and the documentation are an wonderful combination.  You will not be disappointed.",1407801600,6,540,4.966666666666667
