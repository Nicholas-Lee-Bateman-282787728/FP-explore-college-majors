8035790,5,B00030N9Y6,"Walking workouts are the latest rage right now, but this walking workout starring Leigh Crew has stood the test of time.  Leigh uses hand weights throughout the entire walking workout and does different upper body moves using the weights.  Her two background exercisers show two different modifications: one to make it easier (like tapping your toe in front of you instead of lifting your knee) and one to increase the intensity (like adding a hop when you lift your knee.)  Leigh is pleasant and shows good form pointers; her background exercisers are fun to watch. I like adding hand weights to my walking workouts to tone my upper body.  Although they use special ""heavyhands"" weights, a set of any 1, 2, or 3-pound dumbbells will suffice.",1424390400,,742,4.865079365079365
8035791,1,B00030N9Y6,"Leonard Schwartz's BOOK ""Heavyhands: the Ultimate Exercise"" is likely the best book on aerobics ever written.  Indeed, it's the best book on getting lean and fighting fit.  And, if you are reading this review, it means you ""can"" read a book.

But this Walk Plus DVD only offers the barest glimpse of the capabilities and potential of Heavyhands.  This DVD won't hurt you, but you have to understand that there's a lot more to Heavyhands (including Back Aerobics, Belly Aerobics, Butt Aerobics - not to mention actual Heavyhands WALKING) that is not even hinted at on this ""indoor, aerobics class"" oriented DVD.",1222041600,10,610,4.950980392156863
