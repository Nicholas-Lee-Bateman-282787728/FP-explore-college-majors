8552152,5,B00AIEIV9U,An extremely challenging and excellent workout. There is really no teacher like Ilaria. She knows how to get results. I recommend it highly.,1399766400,,140,5.130434782608695
8552153,4,B00AIEIV9U,"Ilaria provides great challenge, but for me, I couldn't go back to doing her DVDs as the choreography gets in the way - it is difficult to work out hard when you don't remember the moves.",1395014400,,187,4.222222222222222
8552154,5,B00AIEIV9U,"I was involved in real kick boxing and boxing a few years ago and really missed the exercise.  I bought this workout dvd and a couple of others by Illaria and am right back in the kickboxing world.  The exercises can be intense, depending on how much you put into it, and they consist of real moves, not just fluffy punching and kicking.  There are not a lot of instructions on how to accurately complete a particular type of kick or punch, so some background knowledge may be helpful to prevent injuries.  The routines can be tricky to master but after watching 2-3 times, I've been able to nail them.  Great workout overall!  Very enjoyable.",1374796800,2,643,4.547826086956522
8552155,3,B00AIEIV9U,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

I like this instructor very much and have most of her other workout DVDs.  Sadly, these latest releases have been a disappointment for me.

Pros:  Intensity is enough to feel like you get a workout.  Routine structure is similar to previous bodystrike workouts but moves are different enough to keep it interesting.

Cons:  The sound quality is just terrible.  Overall the sound is muffled.  What little you can hear, it ends up the music is interfering with being able to hear the instructor's cues.  I could not really hear anything she said.  For those who do not like hearing the instructor talk, this would be a pro for them.  The film quality also seems much worse than previous videos, rather out of focus and the colors seem off, too green or red or something, making the garish background neon lighting even worse.

Overall, the production values were just too poor and outweighed the pros for me.",1374105600,,971,4.8121212121212125
8552156,5,B00AIEIV9U,"Great leg workout and hits cardio too cuz Ilaria NEVER stops! Not the greatest production quality but it sounds better on different tv's. The combo's took the second or third time through before I felt like I wasn't flopping and flailing like a dying fish,  so stick with it!",1370044800,,275,4.612244897959184
8552157,5,B00AIEIV9U,"This is an excellent workout!  I won't go into the details of the workout - other reviewers are really good at that and frankly I am surprised this DVD does not have more reviews - but I can tell you it is awesome.  The quality at first might put you off if you are used to Cathe and other more finessed videos but it gets better right away - within first 5 minutes it is hard to hear Ilaria.  The music is perfect (not campy workout music) for the exercises which are really tough - I have been working out for 20 years (no breaks) and am partial to the strong boot camp workouts and this was tough to get through, so do not let 45 minutes stop you because it might not be long enough.  LOTS of kicking so be ready to feel like you can barely lift your legs half way into this and she has other ideas.  And Ilaria is really fun to watch! She is really enjoying herself and that is infectious.",1365552000,5,893,4.051136363636363
