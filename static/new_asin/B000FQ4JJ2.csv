There's no music to distract, Kira gives good instruction. I always know that when I go back to it, because I have gone back to it many times, that I have to do half the reps for the first time and then build up or else I can't walk or sit down comfortably for DAYS. I usually intersperse other things (HIIT, cardio, other weight reps) in between the segments. I feel like this is a good, basic overall workout. Nothing fancy, but effective.",1443398400,,569,4.377358490566038
8325104,5,B000FQ4JJ2,"I like this workout because it is simple to follow at home and convenient. The two small workouts of upper body and lower body make it easy to fit at least one into my day. The instructor is no-nonsense, easy to understand and pleasant. I will definitely get more of her workouts!",1208217600,4,280,4.403846153846154
8325105,5,B000FQ4JJ2,I got this for the no equipment aspect. I was pleasantly surprised that the workout hits alot of core and abs too! I travel for work and can get a great workout from this in my hotel room. The best part is there are workout choices and they are all under 30 minutes. Perfect for my schedule!,1148860800,7,291,4.12280701754386
8325106,5,B000FQ4JJ2,"I loved Kira's Total Body Tone dvd, so I got this one for when I travel. It's a great workout and you only use your body! I like that it is more athletic than pilates and that there are options to make it easier or harder. I also like the choices of a whole body or body part workouts.

This dvd contained no music. I think omitting the music is a good idea, usually I find music on exercise videos can get monotonous, annoying &/or be a distraction.

I would recommmend this dvd as a great workout especially when traveling!",1148515200,13,525,4.24
