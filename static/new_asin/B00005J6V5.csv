7938427,5,B00005J6V5,This dvd contains the video clips of Man Overboard and Adams song. For anyone that owns the cronicals you already have Adams Song... As there are no extra features I would leave this one for hardcore blink fans only... I must admit bought it though but only because I love the Man Overboard clip... tee hee funny midgets!,1011830400,2,321,4.551724137931035
7938428,5,B00005J6V5,"Up until the release of this DVD, ""Metallica: S&M"" was the best music DVD I had. I had never seen the videos for either song, but I loved the songs so much I heard them over and over. When I went to the store and had my mom buy it, she said ""this is a waste of money"", and I said ""Well, you don't like Blink-182, so I wouldn't talk"". When I put it into my DVD player, I was amazed at how good the picture looked crisp and clear and the sound quality was awesome, even if it was in 2.0 Surround. I hope Blink releases a DVD with the music video for ""The Rock Show"" off of ""Take Off Your Pants & Jacket"" one of Blink's best albums to date. Buy this DVD!",994896000,3,651,3.8296296296296295
7938429,4,B00005J6V5,"The Man Overboard DVD video is a must have for hardcore Blink182 fans.  While it's rather short, the comical mischeif (and lack of clothing)of the young misfits that are Blink182 is absolutly hilarious.  However, if Blink is ""just another band"" in your collection of CD's, then I would say don't bother, because one can't appreciate the short time spent with Mark Tom and Travis in this movie unless they already know them.  *For hardcore fans only!*",989539200,2,450,4.894736842105263
