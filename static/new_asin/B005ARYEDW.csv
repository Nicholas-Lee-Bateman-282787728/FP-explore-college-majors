4641340,5,B005ARYEDW,The extras on this set are great especillay those on season six.  As usual the commentaries give you an chance to find out what might be involved/behind the make a show such as this.  Enjoyed this set just as much as I did CSI:Miami and CSI:LV (the original).,1323302400,,259,4.375
4641341,4,B005ARYEDW,"The only issue we have is that it would not play in the DVD player. This was not the seller's fault though. The new one he sent us worked a bit better. It plays perfectly fine in the laptop, so it was no big deal.",1321142400,,213,3.7555555555555555
8463556,5,B005ARYEDW,"I am at this date in the fifth season and I am extremely satisfied with the series as it is so far.  Being a resident of NY and recently
(4 years) retired from a city job, I can identify with the good sides as well as the down sides of municipal worker jobs.  The NYPD is
the best of the professional police forces in the world and I love in particular the forensic end of crime fighting.  I would have liked
to have been a forensic scientist or at least a criminalist.  This show seems to accurately portray what these scientists do to track
down the lowlives that prowl the dark streets of Gotham.  Senise is especially good at being a hard nosed, yet sensitive investigator
as well as a detective. The cast is very very good, the photography excellent and the villians deliciously evil and nasty.  Note that
I also got the first 10 seasons of CSI Las Vegas and much can be said about that show positively.  Also a great cast, sexy gals
and nasty evil ones. though the investigators are not detectives.  And a good part of the show: no Dr Sweets!!
  I just wish CSI NY could have continued longer than 9 seasons; there is a lot of evil in the Naked City and the police and citizens
need to keep alert.  I  also got the first seasons of NCIS & NCIS LA but have yet to review them.  If you like smart stories, good
acting and occasional mild humor (though not like CASTLE) watch this series.  I got this series from Amazon like all my DVD
sets.  Some cute women too.  bye",1399852800,,1471,4.256317689530686

8463558,5,B005ARYEDW,My wife and myself totally enjoy'd this series. We both are continually amazed at the plot's and new storey line's in each new episode. We are enthralled in all the csi shows. We thank you for the speed at which you get them to us here in Australia.,1361059200,,249,4.208333333333333

Was ordered as a Christmas gift and well received by person given to.",1357689600,,119,4.714285714285714
8463560,4,B005ARYEDW,My only regret was getting a set w/o subtitles. I am otherwise very pleased with the quality of the DVD's. Wil continue to use Amazon in the future.,1352678400,,148,4.321428571428571
8463561,4,B005ARYEDW,"This is my second favorite CSI.  I found the stories to be great and I loved buying it with seasons 1 - 7.
I highly recommend this show.",1351382400,,136,3.857142857142857
8463562,3,B005ARYEDW,"Not too bad.  I LOVE NCIS, so I thought I might like this series.  Some of the storylines are too grusome for me, and the music is too obnoxious.  This series also has a lot going on- up to 3 different crimes being solved in one episode.  Very serious, not even a hint of humor.  I gave it 3 stars because the actors are good.",1349740800,,326,3.953846153846154
8463563,5,B005ARYEDW,"I recently purchased the complete 1-7 and was very happy with everything. The boxes where in very good shape. Delivery was pretty fast, especially since it shipped Sunday and I got it Tuesday (even used the super savings). I've already started watching S3 and the DVDs I watched work fine, no glitches to speak of.

The only thing I would like to see is for the box set to have a case a box to insert the seasons into, and a episode guide would be great CBS! That is the only feature I do not like, but that is just me.

All in all if you are looking for the complete S1-7 of CSI: New York I'd recommend this one. I hope this helps in the purchase of this item.",1345593600,,661,4.076923076923077
8463564,5,B005ARYEDW,"I love CSI. I bought CSI season1-10 ,CSINY season1-7 and soon will get CSI MIAMI season1-9. I wonder if I am a CSI addict.
Every time I see these TV shows, the story lines are different and I can enjoy them. In addition, the prices are surprisingly
reasonable. Why don't you buy them?",1326326400,2,284,4.377358490566038
8463565,4,B005ARYEDW,Enjoyed watching these dvds and keeping up with a very good television series.  I would recommend them to any CSI addict like me.,1324684800,,129,4.608695652173913
