7158143,5,B00X3PSKK6,My granddaughters just loved it and we did too. Great movie!,1439596800,,60,4.545454545454546
7158144,1,B00X3PSKK6,"Very bad acting from the younger folks, and am disappointed that they put a Friesian on the cover when Beauty isn't played by one.",1439078400,2,130,4.458333333333333
7158145,1,B00X3PSKK6,Played this movie and the kids couldn't even keep watching it- I was shocked seeing it was a big budget studio,1437177600,2,110,4.285714285714286
7158146,2,B00X3PSKK6,"A warm fuzzy at best, a poor remake of a classic tale, in reality a simple family film. This is a children's movie with borderline everything. I have seen worse but it hardly is in the classic or even memorable category. If you love animal movies this one is there but low on the list.",1437091200,2,285,4.2
7158147,1,B00X3PSKK6,"My family watched this as a rental. My expectations weren't high, but I was astonished at the terrible quality of the acting and cinematography.

""Black Bauty' was played by a horse with an obviously painted-over star on his forehead. There were many many scenes that relied on a character talking over film of them with their mouth not moving. The main character appeared to be 22 when she was supposed to be much younger.

Ugh. I would give it fewer stars if I could.",1437004800,5,469,4.571428571428571
7158148,1,B00X3PSKK6,"I didn't expect this re-make to be a great one, but based on the classic book and the original flick, I thought it might at least be mildly entertaining.  Wrong.  The film opens with a fully matured beauty pretending to be a shy and youthful misfit.  The chronological age of 15 may be correct, but the intention in the book was that this was an ADOLESCENT GIRL, not a fully-matured (albeit 15-year-old) woman.  She was supposed to look and act (uh-oh, did I say 'ACT?') like a misfit, but she looks the absolute personification of high-school-clique-type.  (Attempting to wipe a grain of dust off your face or jacket really isn't that convincing!  Anyway, in the next scene she's grooming the new arrival: Black Beauty.  I'm in my seventies now, but for almost 40 years I rode, trained and showed horses.  Believe me, NO animal shelter is going to allow a completely green person ALL ALONE to attend to a newly arrived horse - and in a horsetrailer too - SO dangerous, not only for the human but for the horse too.  Then we see her at the dinner table with -- REALLY?, her PARENTS?!  I guess she was adopted.  Well, that's as far as I could manage to watch this ruination of what could have been a decent little remake.  I will try to get my money back.",1437004800,9,1254,4.451754385964913

7158157,5,B00X3PSKK6,"Light and fun version - perfect
For tween girls like mine that love animals!  I appreciate the POSITIVE message - age appropriate and encouraging.  One dinner scene the daughter is disrespectful to her dad, but they work it out :).  Not the typical movie where the lead has to be the beautiful, cool girl; she struggles with insecurities and learns to feel confident in positive ways!  Good message!",1451174400,,399,4.823529411764706

Might as well get down to it. If you're looking for a movie adaptation of the original story, you're cold, wayyy cold. This was not even close to the original story except for a black horse who had been mistreated. We don't even get to see how he was mistreated, which was really the driving conflict in the wonderful original.

Even with an adaptation, the actual story should have begun much earlier, showing us all the turmoil the horse had been through. Instead we got the ending, which was basically horse goes to rehab with young Audry at her grandfathers farm. Audry applies ointment. Exercises horse. Feeds him good food. Vet visits. They enter a 4-H show with him, which could have been a lot more interesting except for the very dry acting of the not-at-all-intimidating mean girl. Boring, boring, boring

7158162,4,B00X3PSKK6,"This movie had a lot of potential, but it shows that it was manipulated in many sort of ways to make it as what people are describing it as ""awkward"". In my opinion, I think it is a very family-friendly movie. Other than that, the property that they filmed it on was absolutely breathtaking, the barn they filmed in is beautiful, and the main horse was so pretty. I also thought that the acting was okay. But i found much interest in Blythe :) a beautiful horse and rider!! (even though she was mean) I loved the beach and pond scenes! it all looks like such a country lifestyle.
anyways i think that this movie means really well and like i said, very family friendly.",1443916800,,668,4.352
7158163,1,B00X3PSKK6,"The camera angles on this movie are so angled that you get dizzy watching it.  The scene transitions are a joke.  The acting is awful and the dialogue is fake and not natural.  Bleh!  Also, the narrative parts are much quieter than the talking parts.  Seriously, how did this movie make it past any critique.  If I was an actor, I wouldn't want it to be released at all.  Bruce Davison is the only actor that did a sorta okay acting job.",1441843200,,437,4.2560975609756095

7158167,1,B00X3PSKK6,"Waste of time and money--extremely disappointing. Bad acting, awkward writing, awkward cinematography, awful music. The cover is a scam, it has nothing to do with the traditional story and the horse is a different pony in the movie. The 16-year old teenagers are played by 20-year old actors with tons of makeup and bad acting and nothing comes together in this painful production. The story is cold, the music doesn't fit, there's no connection between the pony and the protagonist-she just kisses the horses forehead a hundred times while the horse is disinterested. I would feel embarrassed to release this, let alone ask for money to see it. I'm writing this hoping to save others their time and dollars.",1440288000,2,708,4.957983193277311
8714934,1,B00X3PSKK6,"This movie is atrocious!  The acting is some of the worse i have ever seen!  I will be askIng for a refund. Even my 7year old who LOVES HORSES, thought this movie was bad.  The movie is about 75% voice over, 15% montages, and the rest, just bad awkward acting. I have seen home movies that are better then this. Its not even about the money, but the waste of time. I have limited time with my little girl and horse movies are something she enjoys watching together... this movie took about 2 hours of my limited time away from her and we both want that time back...",1534032000,,565,4.212962962962963

8714936,1,B00X3PSKK6,"This movie made us wish we could rank 0 stars.  There is little acting, just voice overs to tell you what they want you to get out of the movie (which they should be acting out, not reading to you), and some extremely unnatural feeling one-on-one conversations.  It's like a bad book on tape that a kid built a movie around.",1529107200,,324,4.295081967213115
