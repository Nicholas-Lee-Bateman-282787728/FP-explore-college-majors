7365928,3,B013I9RJBC,"The stars are not for the content. David Eagleman and his episodes are a 5/5. The problem was that it was in a sort of cheap dvd packaging and at first the dvd didn't work. Just a heads up, there are two discs and one is on the left side underneath the inside paper. LASTLY, the DVD box was damaged and had an ugly puncture on the top of the backside of it which made the cheap packing look even worse. The Amazon box I got it in had no damage. So this was done prior and I was not happy with it.",1448323200,5,496,3.825242718446602
7365929,2,B013I9RJBC,"I watched the series on PBS.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 as credit to its informative aspect.  But the last episode projecting into the future of humanity, I found just too disturbing.  His exaltation of humanity, singing the paean of  science and technology is just too obsequious for my brain. It coincides too closely with my observation of 21st Century science; more sensationalism and no soul.  It partakes in the destruction of our ecosystem.  He has boldly reimagined Descartes' famous dictum:  I think therefore I am, as '..Even if I'm brain in simulation, I'm thinking about it therefore I am.'  It's his vision of immortality of this 'super species' in remapped human brain in electrical signals and set forth in forever journey of sensory stimulation without consequences.  Seems like eternal hell to me.  I believe Descartes has also said, 'By the science of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which, presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last degree of wisdom.'  I am interpreting this as all knowledge should ultimately lead to wisdom.  Otherwise we are forever brilliant juveniles marveling at all monstrous possibilities that include final self-destruction.  This particular member of super species of his designation will humbly cede my place in this crowning glory, and will embrance my physical body and its connection to Natures evolution in which  love, compassion, mortality I share with other creatures on this planet.  And with head lowered as peccant human in this ruthless age of Arrogance of Man and Technology.",1448150400,3,1579,5.137254901960785
7365930,5,B013I9RJBC,"I love this series. Eagleman resides in Houston, Tx. And so do I. So it was fascinating to watch and see so many Houston landmarks sprinkled into a great series. I am also an AP Psychology teacher, so this has helped me relay the topics we are studying to my high school students. I highly recommend it!",1447632000,11,303,4.333333333333333
7365931,1,B013I9RJBC,"This is a very poor companion to the PBS series for those who seek further elucidation of brain research. It is a poor copy of the video. To start with the book does not have an index, so looking for particular items is impossible. Dr. Eagleman states that his purpose is not to create a textbook. He does have short 3 page glossary and a section called endnotes. The endnotes do contain reference material and are grouped by chapter. The coverage is sparse. He flits from one topic to another. Examples are his coverage of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and the types of stroke and their location within the brain as well as their affects. The one page on Autism which includes a picture is rather light, especially considering that it is now termed Autism Spectrum Disorder. This is an admission to the fact that it is a range of diseases.

There are numerous authors who are not mentioned this book. If you cannot find the author they are probably mentioned in an elementary Psychology textbook. An example of this is the Stroop Effect and Brenda Milner's work with HM, the patient whose hippocampus was removed. He does cover the basics of Artificial Intelligence and technology well.

I guess what I am saying is that  it is difficult to find any in depth information. A much more informative series is that by Eric Kandel and Charlie Rose called The Brain Series. It is much more informative on the latest research and involves the latest researchers and their opinions on the research.
 For those who just desire a copy of the video the book is fine.

Dr. Eagleman has reached his goal of creating a nontext book.",1447632000,6,1630,4.685314685314685

You may think that you are not prejudice and believe in fairness but it really is not important what you may be thinking since your conscious and your existence is more than just a simple brain decision of yes or no. It is much more than you can ever think or know __even when you are conscious or not conscious, awake or not awake__ and that is what this series offers, a chance to look at how scientists have analyzed existence and behavior of human brain __IN MOST CASES__ not all cases. Pulling is different than pushing since you will feel that human being that you are just about to kill... There is so much to learn that you will need to watch few of the episodes more than once in order to comprehend and remember it all. It can help you understand yourself much better since it is partially science although many individuals may think that they know it all when it comes to human existence especially their own existence.

Although driving is a universal skill, it can be challenging to drive abroad where in the UK, drivers use their left side of the road instead of driving on their right. Now that is almost the same as if everything on your left side would appear on your right side and you had to adjust to living backwards. Your brain can still relate to many issues in those circumstances but what happens if you happen to be blind at birth and after few decades you end up with vision... There are no connections there, no memories, no references that your brain can refer to, so would you experience vision after 30 years of no vision in the same way as an individual who had vision at birth...

1. What is Reality?
2. What Makes Me?
3. Who Is in Control?
4. How Do I Decide?

Every episode offers a view of human brain. The episode ""How Do I Decide?"" is a must see since they explore the fact that brain is not under human all the time and humans can not even remember when they commit an act since they are so separated from their brain that unknowingly they can commit a crime. This is an informative documentary that gets you see human brain much differently than you ever possibly have. It obviously seems that when it comes to reality, it is much different at times that one may assume what reality means to them when it comes to functionality of brain.

The most complex thing weve discovered in the Universe is the human brain.

For the past twenty years, Ive been trying to understand how what happens in three pounds of jello-like material somehow becomes us.  What we feel, what matters to us, our beliefs, and our hopeseverything we are happens in here.

The above comes at the very beginning of this documentary written and narrated by David Eagleman.  Eagleman is a writer and neuroscientist (or nervous system scientist) who specializes in brain plasticity, time perception, synesthesia, and the intersection of science with social policy.  (Plasticity is the brains ability to adapt by creating or modifying existing neural connections.  Synesthesia is the condition in which a sensory experience normally associated with one sense modality [like vision] occurs when another sense modality [like hearing] is stimulated.  For example, particular sounds produce particular colour sensations.)

This epic series blends science with visual effects, true personal stories, interesting experiments, and addresses some of the BIG questions.  In fact, each episode is titled with a BIG question.

Why should we even bother learning about and understanding the human brain?  The answer is that by doing so, we can come closer to understanding humanity.  Thus, the effort is definitely worth it.

Throughout this film, you will get to see such things as Alcatraz, wars, Romanian orphans, cup stacking, solo climbing, the trolley dilemma, the Chinese room, and ant colonies.

Below I will reproduce the title and a small part of the introduction of each episode:

(1) WHAT IS REALITY?

I want to show you how the brain takes in information, sifts through it to find patterns, and uses it to build the multi-sensory, technicolour show that is your reality.

(2) WHAT MAKES ME?

Im going explore a fundamental question about our lives.  What shapes who you become? This is the story of how your life shapes your brain and how your brain shapes your life.

(3) WHO IS IN CONTROL?

In this [episode] Im going to investigate the weird ways our brain secretly controls everything that we do.  How without our awareness, the brain controls the complex machinery of the body and makes decisionsThis is the story of everything the brain does that remains hidden from us.  It is the story of whos REALLY in control.

(4) HOW DO I DECIDE?

Our brains are constantly making decisions.  Some were aware of, most were not.  Deciphering what we hear or see or smellthese are decisions.  So is being afraid, falling in love, giving in, resisting.  Decision-making is what allows us to navigate a course through life.  And your lifetime of choices has sculpted you into the person you are right now.

(5) WHY DO I NEED YOU?

I want to show you how our brains are fundamentally wired to work togetherhow the social network that envelopes us from birth is vital for our survival.  Understanding how brains deal with each other allows us to understand what bonds our species, driving us to help one another and what makes us hatewhat allows acts of human violence.  It helps us make sense of our past and holds the key to our future.

(6) WHO WILL WE BE?

This is a journey into who we might become.  Well look at how we can use our brains to control new kinds of bodies, how our sensory experience can be expanded to new horizons.  Well look at how we might one day separate our minds from our physical selves, even possibly overcome death.

Finally, there is an excellent companion book to this documentary that I strongly recommend.  It is also entitled The Brain: the story of you and was written by Eagleman.

In conclusion, this documentary makes understanding the human brain accessible to all with a desire to learn.  It is also well- presented and you will see why David Eagleman has been called by some The Carl Sagan of Neuroscience.

David Eagleman is an intelligent brain scientist, as well as, an excellent narrator and an engaging television personality. He breaks down complex psychological ideas and difficult brain biology into a presentation that the average person can grasp. Even my middle-school age son enjoyed and was enlightened by Eagleman's program. This program brings forth the subject matter through a wonderful array of graphic images and case studies of persons both dead and alive which helps the viewer make a more personal and fully human connection to the material.

Nevertheless, it was very worthwhile to have watched this series of lectures on the brain, illustrating very well the discussions in the book.  The speculative science opened up by the modern biological investigations of the brain add an entire dimension to classical problems from literature and philosophy, and other areas of the humanities and social sciences.  It is interesting to consider that basic neuroscience may answer, from a biological perspective, some of the most perplexing problems about human beings.  Questions about who and what we are seem, to some extent, to be addressed by neuroscience.  A fascinating, if perhaps a little disturbing, aspect of this series, is its final episode, in which the future of humanity is considered.  I strongly recommend this series for its timeliness and its scientific and speculative point of view.  The investigations of the brain are unlocking something miraculous about life.  When one puts this into perspective with the rest of biology, it is part of a science that has opened our eyes to the wonder and miracle of life.  I think it is important to recognize that the brain is just one of our organs.

This is someone who really understands how to connect with the layman. While I myself have some medical / science background, the concept of the brain has always fascinated me, and is still so little understood. David Eagleman's delivery style is so at ease, and really makes you want to learn. His manner of explanation along with how he illustrates his points make his topics fascinating and captivating. And even on some of the more controversial aspects - such as humans needing to judge others to survive, and mob mentality of propaganda, etc - he helps you to best understand the concepts behind the topic, and why things occur.
