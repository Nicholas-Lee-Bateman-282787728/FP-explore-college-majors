8110809,5,B000EKELMY,"Thunderbirds to me is the most fascinating and the most well made puppet program I have ever seen. It doesn't matter which episode or movie of the Thunderbirds I've watched, because I am just blown away with the creativity and action of these incredible shows. Considering that they were made long before a lot of computer technology.
The sets,scripts, puppets, and the puppetry is amazing. I never get tired of watching these programs. They were made by sheer creativity and hard pain staking work.
If you're not a Thunderbird fan yet, then The Univited is a good place to start. The vhs, which is what I have, is reasonably priced and the color is brilliant.
It is well worth your time and money to purchase this tape or any of the other Thunderbirds' programs.
It's a wonderful look back when Saturday morning program was worth getting up for.
It's just a great and fun series like none other.",1293840000,,896,4.677215189873418
