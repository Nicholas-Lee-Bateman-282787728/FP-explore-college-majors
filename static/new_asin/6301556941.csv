7813758,4,6301556941,"Once again thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I was able to see a classic WWF event in the third annual Survivor Series. This Survivor Series was memorable for a bunch of reasons as it was the first time that the teams had actual team names to make it seem more of a team effort but also trying to show a step in the direction that the WWF was going in as Hogan was not in the main event for the first time at this event.

The Dream Team vs The Enforcers: Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, Tito Santana & Red Rooster vs Big Bossman, Bad News Brown, Rick Martel & Honky Tonk Man. This was a solid match throughout as everyone put in a good effort with the story of how Brown wasn't a team player in costing his team a fall, the confrontation between former Strike Force members in Santana & Martel & Big Bossman going on his own even after the match to show Dusty Rhodes that he won the battle but not the war.

The Kings Court vs The 4x4s: Randy Savage, Greg Valentine, Dino Bravo & Earthquake vs Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Ronnie Garvin, Bret Hart & Hercules. Now here is a trivia fact but Earthquake was actually subbing for Barry Windham in this match. This was another match that was solid from start to finish as it played out current feuds such as Garvin/Valentine but the real highlight of this match for me was the interaction between Savage & Hart that was a dream match of mine for that time as they really got the crowd going in the time that they were in there together.

The Hulkamaniacs vs The Million Dollar Team: Hulk Hogan, Demolition & Jake Roberts vs Ted Dibiase, Powers Of Pain & Zeuz. This match had so many feuds that the WWF was pushing at the time such as the year long feud with Demolition & Powers Of Pain & the continuing of the Dibiase/Roberts feud. However, the major feud that WWF was pushing at this time was the Hogan/Zeuz feud (don't ask) with the end result being Zeuz being eliminated in less than 3 minutes. From there, Hogan's team was eliminated by pinfalls including Demolition while Dibiase's team was eliminated by disqualifications such as the Powers Of Pain being eliminated for double teaming Hogan. The final result was a Hogan/Dibiase showdown that of course had Hogan winning & while this match was entertaining for what it was, you couldn't help but notice how one-sided this match seemed to be with Jesse Ventura pointing that out constantly throughout the match.

Rowdy's Roddies vs Rude's Brood: Rowdy Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka & The Bushwackers vs Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect & The Fabulous Rougeaus. Before the match, check out the crazy promo of Piper's team to show you what kind of match that this was going to be. This match was really entertaining right from the start as it started crazy with each member of Piper's team taking turns in bitting a body part of Mr. Perfect along with a tease of tension between Rude & Perfect at one point. Piper's team was dominate early with their wild tactics in getting the Rougeaus eliminated. From there, the match really picks up once the Bushwackers get eliminated as Rude & Perfect are forced into wrestling defense leaving us with quite a finish in Piper/Snuka against Rude/Perfect with an impressive showing in Snuka in the end against Perfect. This was my favorite match of the night as this match had it all including commentary as Jesse Ventura just had problems in saying the name of Piper's team which added more comedy to the match.

The Ultimate Warriors vs The Heenan Family: The Ultimate Warrior, Jim Niedhart & The Rockers vs Andre The Giant, Haku, Arn Anderson & Bobby Heenan. The backstory behind this match was what the real life issue that had Tully Blanchard removed from this match with Heenan being added to the match. Just like the Hogan/Zeuz situation, the major feud here was Warrior/Andre that had Andre eliminated by countout right from the getgo. However, this match was an impressive showing for Haku & more importantly Arn Anderson as they were the workhorse of this team with Heenan adding comedy from the time or lack thereof of him getting in the ring before Arn was eliminated leaving Warrior against Heenan that was exactly what you would expect it to be in that it was a squash.

Overall, this was a fun show to watch & one of the best Survivor Series cards in the event's history that I would either go out of my way to get the VHS tape or buy it as part of the Survivor Series anthology.",1309651200,,4405,4.527638190954774
7813759,5,6301556941,"Bossman, Rick Martel, Bad News Brown, and Honky Tonk Man (The Enforcers) VS Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, Red Rooster, and Tito Santana (The Dream Team): A fine match with Beefcake and Rhodes surviving. Bossman attacks Beefcake with the nightstick after the match and he no sold the move. Bossman attacks Rhodes and he bleeds from the head. Bossman cuts a nice promo after the lose. I miss these days of WWF when feuds were well built and interviews meant something.

Hacksaw, Bret Hart, Ronnie Garvin, and Hercules (The 4x4's) VS Randy Savage, Canadian Earthquake, Greg Valentine, and Dino Bravo (King's Court): This was a very good match that ended in anther stupid count-out decision.

The Genuis cuts a promo, I still say he is more enjoyable then anything WWE puts out nowadays.

Hulk Hogan, Jake Roberts, and Demoltion (Hulkamanics) VS Zeus, Ted DiBiase, and Powers of Pain (Million Dollar Team): This was a good match even though it was a basic showing of Hogan being more powerful then anyone in the world. Zeus gets eliminated right off and that was a good idea. DiBiase is the MVP of this match and his fist drop on Roberts was picture perfect. It would have been awesome to see DiBiase make Hogan submit but that would have never happened. Hogan drops a leg and places his crotch right on DiBiase's face as he makes the pin. Entertaining even though it's a Hogan win.

Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect, and Rogeau's (Rude Brood) VS Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, and Bushwackers (Roddy's Rowdies): A very enjoyable match even if the Bushwackers were involved. You've gotta love Rude's tights. When it was down to Rude/Perfect VS Snuka/Piper is when things got good but we got anther cheap crappy count out finish. Does anyone realize this happens every Survivor Series? Perfect faces Snuka in the final moments and wins in the end via perfectplex.

Ultimate Warrior, Jim Neidhart, and Rockers (The Warriors) VS Arn Anderson, Bobby Heenan, Haku, and Andre The Giant (Heenan Family): What an original name for Warrior's team. Many people know Tully Blanchard was suppose to be in the event but he was fired by WWF before this event and Heenan took his place. Andre gets eliminated in mere seconds but GASP! a count-out, who would of thunk that? Heenan drops a knee and pins Jannetty in a shocker. Anderson and Haku were the MVPs of this match. A very good match in the end.

Overall, a very enjoyable Survivor Series even though it had Hogan dominance.",1258070400,,2447,4.786729857819905
7813760,4,6301556941,"This S. Series was full of first.  The matches WERE NOT edited on the tape, Hogan wasn't in the main event, and they stared using team names to make it come off as a real team concept.  As usual, all the matches were given enough time to actually be something worth watching.  The only complain I have is that for both main events, they did the same type of elimination in which they took out the strongest ""heel"" within the first minute under shady circumstances.

Dream Team vs. Enforcers: American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes, Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake, Tito Santana, & The Red Rooster vs. Big Bossman, Bad News Brown, The Honky Tonk Man & Rick ""The Model"" Martel - There were no real highlights in this match although it was just solid from beginning to end & a good opener.

This match is also available on the Dusty Rhodes DVD.

King's Court vs. 4x4's: ""Macho King"" Randy Savage, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, Dino Bravo, & Earthquake vs. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan, ""Rugged"" Ronnie Garvin, Bret ""Hitman"" Hart, & Hercules - Aside from the funny promos where Bret Hart acted like his 2x4 was a machine gun, this match again was solid as the highlight here was the interaction between Savage & Hart.

Hulkamaniacs vs. Million $ Team: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, & WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax & Smash) vs. ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, Zeus, & The Powers of Pain (Barbarian & Warlord) - This was the first of two times in the night that WWF would tease the next chapter of an ongoing fued only to eliminate the ""monster"" heel quickly.  The less said about the Hogan/Zues fued, the better but Zues was eliminated in the first minute by DQ.  After that, Hogan's team was dominated for the most part by Dibiase's team (including Demolition being eliminated) until the referee disqualified both Powers Of Pain at the same time while Dibiase eliminated Roberts leaving a Hogan vs. Dibiase.  Hogan would eventually win (like always) but the result was a little disappointing since the match seemed heavily one-sided  with all of Dibiase's team being disqualified while Hogan's team was eliminated by pinfalls.

Rude's Brood vs. Roddy's Rowdies: Rude's Brood: ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect, & The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Raymond & Jacques Rougeau) vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka, & The Bushwhackers (Luke & Butch) - Before I get started, listen to Jesse Ventura throughout this match for comic relief as he kept attempting to say the name of Piper's team but just couldn't get it right.  Not only was the commentary entertaining but so was the match as well.  They were teasing tension between Heenan & Rude (Heenan didn't come out to ringside) along with the shock that all of Piper's team dominated the match in the early stages eliminating both Rougeau Brothers.  From there, the match really takes off after both Bushwackers were eliminated followed by the Rude/Piper brawl leaving us with a Snuka/Perfect finish.

Ultimate Warriors vs. Heenan Family: The Ultimate Warrior, Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart, & The Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty) vs. Andre the Giant, Haku, Arn Anderson, & Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan - Just like with the Hogan/Zues confrontation, WWF had it so Andre would be eliminated within the first minute by countout.  A majority of the match would be Arn Anderson being the workhorse of the team while Bobby Heenan would just stay on the apron being a coward until the end when Anderson got eliminated & Warrior just destroyed Heenan.  I believe this is Anderson's last performance in WWF as he quickly went back to the NWA and had a cameo appearence at Starrcade the next month.

Overall, this was a fun Survivor Series overall & one I would recommend going out of the way to buy the VHS tape if you can't wait for the DVD Anthology.",1172707200,,3807,4.802450229709035
7813761,4,6301556941,"From Chicago, the third rendition of the annual Survivor Series features five well-designed matches, as each team is given a chance to shine.  An added bonus is that the teams are each designated with fun nicknames.

Unfortunately, the ever-present (and nauseating) hype for the next upcoming chapter of the Hogan vs. Zeus saga is an obvious  detriment. If this supposed super-feud had any legitimacy (even in WWF terms), then why wasn't their Survivor team match the logical main event?  Instead, the Ultimate Warrior gets the main event nod and proceeds to squander it with a lackluster effort.

1. The Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Tito Santana, Red Rooster, & Brutus Beefcake) vs. the Enforcers (Rick Martel, Big Bossman, Bad News Brown, & Honky Tonk): 3 1/2 ***
A solid opening match kicks off the event in style.  Rhodes & Beefcake, in the end, prevail against the overmatched Bossman.

2. The 4 x 4's (Hacksaw Duggan, Bret Hart, Ronnie Garvin, & Hercules) vs. The King's Court (""Macho King"" Randy Savage, Dino Bravo, Earthquake & Greg Valentine): 4 1/2 ****
Savage vs. Hart is the highlight here, although it is too bad that this fun match doesn't end with a face-off between them.  Instead, the end result is a semi-squash, as Savage's obnoxious squad prevails somewhat easily.  Still, it is an excellent effort from both teams.

3. The Hulkamaniacs (WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, Jake Roberts, & WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition) vs. The Million $ Team (Ted DiBiase, Zeus, & the Powers of Pain): 4 1/2 ****
As you may have guessed, it is mostly the Hulk Hogan show.  The WWF, to its credit, though, allows Hogan to appear weak in comparison to Zeus and the Powers, which helps set up the match's finale (a surprising good showdown between the injured WWF Champion and the ruthless DiBiase).  Even commentator Jesse Ventura's biting criticism of Hogan being ""saved"" by the referee multiple times adds a tinge of realism here.  A ""miraculously"" recovered Hogan ultimately defeats DiBiase (no surprise), but it is a solidly entertaining finish to arguably the night's best match.

4. Roddy's Rowdies (Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, & the Bushwhackers) vs. The Rude Brood (Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect, & the Rougeaus): 4 ****
I would rate this one, surprisingly, as the event's most entertaining, LOL match. as more obnoxious villains meet some wild opposition.  The Rowdies initially get plenty of biting action, but the Rude Brood slowly puts Roddy's team away for the win.  Give Curt ""Mr. Perfect"" Hennig the night's MVP award for an awesome job, as even the Hennig-Snuka finale is main event caliber.

5. The Warriors (I-C Champion Ultimate Warrior, Jim Neidhart, & the Rockers) vs. The Heenan Family (Arn Anderson, Haku, Andre the Giant, & Bobby Heenan): 3 ***
Tully Blanchard is a no-show here, so Heenan takes his place.  Shockingly (or maybe not), the Giant is knocked out within the first minute. Afterwards, the match remains watchable.  The Warrior, in limited action, displays once again that he is a poor man's Sting.  Suffice to say, he doesn't exert much effort as the match's star player.  Instead, Anderson & Haku vs. the Rockers carry the match putting forth an excellent show.  The sub-plot features Anderson's increasing frustration about being stuck with Heenan as his tag partner.  In the end, the Warrior crushes Heenan for the win.

Overall, it is a great event with only a few lame spots (involving Zeus and/or Hogan & Beefcake).  We recommend locating a copy if you can find a reasonable price.",1095724800,5,3507,4.933560477001704
7813762,4,6301556941,"I don'y know why but this PPV looks like it was taped in a bingo hall or something.  This was the PPV where Hogan and Zues where feuding.  Also Where the Hitman started the buzz about being a singles wrestle.  The highlight being The Warriors vs The Heenan Family.  Andre gets taken out within the first minute and Arn Anderson has to make up for most of the team.  The Rockers' deliver a good preformance and in the end the Warrior destroys Bobby Heenan (his last active match), awesome PPV.",1047427200,2,492,4.4222222222222225
