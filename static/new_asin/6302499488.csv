472891,5,6302499488,"This is a movie that I saw years ago and could not find again until recently. It has a bit of sci fi, action, romance and was great to be able to see it again.",1371340800,,159,3.5714285714285716
472892,5,6302499488,"Oh man, movies just don't get much more romantic than this!  Brendan Hughes, who played the role of the alien Prince in this movie, was just incredibally romantic.  I have seen Brendan in a few other movies, and he is without a doubt one of the most beautiful men God ever created!  I was really hoping the cute little teenage heroine in this movie would go with the Prince to his home planet, aah, but alas, well....spoiler alert!  Of course she didn't.  I was SO dissapointed she didn't!  The part of Jester was played by bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  He also did an outstanding job.  So funny!  (trivia bit-the teenage girl in this film, Ione Skye, is the real-life daughter of 60's rock star, Donovan.  She looks kinda like him to me)",1192492800,3,752,4.463235294117647
472893,5,6302499488,"Looking at the movie at first glance you might think that it isn't much, but the truth is that despite little 80's quirks, the movie is just a pleasure to watch. The plot is surprisingly developed with interesting unexpected twists. It's got a little bit of everything in it from sci-fi and thrill to yes, even a bit of romance if you look for it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1188777600,4,390,4.430555555555555
472894,5,6302499488,"I saw this movie once, ages ago, and was thoroughly impressed.  It looked like a cheesy sci-fi bit of fluff; but, it has a great plot, solid acting, and good twists.  I look every once in a while to see if someone at New Line is bright enough to release it on dvd (not yet).
  If you get the chance to see this film grab it.  It is one of the best of the genre.  You will not regret watching Stranded.",1182038400,4,401,3.888888888888889
472895,4,6302499488,"Yes, I arrived at this space looking for STORM CENTER.  I remember seeing it when I was a kid, somehow sensing that the film had budget and rhetoric problems, but turning into an anti-HUAC 12-yr-old as a result of its polemic.",1149292800,2,226,4.512195121951219

472897,4,6302499488,"I have a video library of Bette Davis' work that most fans would die for.  This was one piece that escaped me.  I am so glad I bought it.  It is a very solid work and one that I'm sure a very picky Bette was proud of.
My  video library is lacking one of Bette's movies, Storm Center.  If anyone  knows how I can get my hands on it, include that info in your review.",957484800,7,365,3.8
472898,4,6302499488,"Despite being short in length (approx. 25 min.), ""Stranded,"" originally featured as an episode of the old television show ""Telephone Time,"" offers a stellar, solid Bette Davis performance  which should not be missed by any die-hard fan.  The story consists of a  teacher (Davis) and a small classroom of students who get caught in a  blizzard and are stranded in the schoolhouse.  Although quite corny,  ""Stranded"" does manage to conjure up some emotions towards the  end.  For the die-hards only.",944438400,17,497,5.125
7826616,4,6302499488,This is a good movie.  A bit cheesy but still enjoyable.  I desperately need it to come out on dvd though.  My vcr ate my copy and on top of that is now broken.  I don't want to buy another vcr just for the few movies I still have on tape and I really want to be able to watch it again.,1522972800,,286,3.564516129032258

7826620,5,6302499488,I had been looking for this movie for a very long time.  I'm truly happy that I found it on Amazon.  The only thing that would make me feel better is if I could find this film on DVD.,1438905600,,183,3.6666666666666665
7826621,5,6302499488,"I absolutely love this movie.  The acting, plot, special effects, music, everything is wonderful.  Problem is my video machine doesn't work anymore so I can't play the VHS copy I've owned for almost 20 years.  I just wish someone would release this onto DVD format.  It would be a top seller, I'm sure.",1419552000,,302,4.6415094339622645
