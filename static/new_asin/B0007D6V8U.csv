2211135,3,B0007D6V8U,"This is a simple workout that is good for those who've never worked out before (like my husband, who's doing it with me).  I really like the strength exercises, but the sweat exercises (cardio) are simple and get really boring after a month.  I like that the people on the video don't get a rest--they're doing the whole video just like the rest of us.  We alternated sweat/abs 1-2 and sculpt 1-2 for the first 30 days.  We're on day 44 and we're alternatiing the 1-2 and 3-4 sets now (gives us a little rest in between the more difficult ones, or if we just wake up too late to do the longer one).  I'm ready to move on to something else, though.  I don't know if I can do 46 more days of this...",1186444800,10,697,4.125925925925926
2211136,5,B0007D6V8U,"I have been doing power90 off and on for 2 years now and it really works. I lost 20 pounds when I began and have kept it off! I literally have become a walking billboard for Beach Body because of the great results I received. Tony Horton is a great motivator...a little goofy at times, but great nevertheless. If you change your diet and stick to this program you will not be disappointed.",1149379200,9,389,4.342465753424658

2211139,4,B0007D6V8U,"I agree that this program can get boring if you follow it for 90 days doing the same workouts over and over. I, myself, think I only made it the first 30 or so. However, you will find a solid workout here in both circuit and cardio. Tony Horton is a like-able guy, although he always cues his lefts and rights. The music also gets old pretty quick. I like the 100-ab routine because you go through them so quickly that it doesn't feel like you're doing 100 sit ups. I also really like the meter/timer on the side that shows how much you've done so far and how much further you have to go. I quit the ""Power 90 program"" long ago, but I still keep this DVD in my regular workout rotation.",1125878400,26,686,4.126865671641791
2211140,2,B0007D6V8U,"Well, there's good news and bad news.  Let's take care of the bad news first.

The Beachbody company itself is very difficult to deal with and you must make certain you are very careful in your dealings with them.  Their ""full 30-day, money-back guarantee"" is a little misleading.  Long story short, it took me almost two months to receive a full refund from them on ""additional tapes"" they shipped to me before my 30 day preview was up.  They were willing to refund the cost of the product, but were refusing to refund the original shipping charges and to pay for the return shipping.  They even admitted to the Better Business Bureau they only gave me 26 days to preview the program, but felt that was ""adequate.""  I had to write personally to their CEO and state my intentions to bring false advertising charges against them to the Florida state Attorney General for them to finally refund my money in full.  There are many complaints against them for their questionable business practices(...).

The good news: Power90 is not a bad program, not by any means.  I did see some results with it and anyone who devotes the 45 minutes a day (30 minutes for Level 1/2), 6 days a week the program demands will find some success.  But you could also say the same about any program you faithfully used for that amount of time.  Additionally, the production quality is very poor and it gets very, very boring after a while - the music is completely un-motivating and Tony Horton's jokes do get annoying after constant repetition.  But I did like how Tony paid attention to each phase of the workout, even warm-up and cool-down.  For example, countless exercise videos put emphasis on ""drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout"", but you must remember stop your tape, interrupt your workout, and do it yourself - Tony actually builds it into his program.  Also, the warm-up and cool-down stretches are some of the best I've seen.

Overall, though, I don't think the program is stellar enough or different enough to warrant the risk it takes to do business with Beachbody.  If you want to purchase this program and devote the time it takes to do it, I believe you will see results - but there are plenty of other programs out there that could deliver the same results for you without the headaches of having to deal with Beachbody.",1123113600,87,2340,4.654501216545012
2211141,4,B0007D6V8U,"Power 90 is a 90 day program for men and women designed to transform your booty from NOT to HOT! The system includes 2 DVD's, a transformation tracker (paper calender to record your progress), descriptive booklet and guide to healthy eating.

To begin the program you record your weight and measurements. Then push play with Tony the instructor in your DVD player. You alternate between circuit days and cardio/abs days. The circuit days include exercises such as heavy pants, push ups, one arm triceps, bicep curls, back flys, lunges and more. The cardio/abs day includes kickboxing, leg raises, ab work and more. As you progress you move from the first DVD to the progressively  harder second DVD. One very nice feature is each session is only about 30-40 minutes long. As the Beachbody company says from ""power to shower in under an hour"". Another great feature is the use of a sidebar on your picture screen. As you complete each exercise the color changes so you can view your time and progress.

Tony the instructor is a peppy guy with a sense of humor but not overdone. He is accompanied by a man and a woman in each set. Cueing is good with modifications suggested for those who need it. You may do the workout with free weights or purchase bands from the company. The bands are heavy duty and in my opinion make the workout much more difficult but may put strain on the back.

A simple diet guide is included in the program. Called ""Michi's ladder"" it suggests good foods to select from and eat most of the time. This is a simple brochure and more information is needed. To transform your body exercise is very important but what you eat counts A LOT! Not enough attention is paid to this.

Beachbody also recommends supplements which they sell of course. They claim that these will enhance your workout and help you achieve the body of your dreams at a much more rapid pace. However, when I checked into it, I found the studies they had done were limited and incomplete. Many of the ingredients are unproven. I would think twice about purchasing them. A ""commercial"" for the supplements is included on all Beachbody tapes.

I checked out the website over a period of several months and found a number of people who were happily shrinking in size and weight or gaining muscle. Many posted their pictures. Conversely, I also saw many who posted pictures and slowly faded from sight dropping out of the program, leaving their ""befores"" but no ""afters"" for all to see in cyberspace!

I really think the exercise program can be very effective, but it is repetitious. Day after day you will for 90 days be doing the same thing. But its a boot camp. For those who want to kick a** and don't mind repetition - this may be the ticket. Those who want to try it should also check out the free message boards at the companies beachbody.com web site.

Others may want to go with something simpler. Whatever you do, if you opt to go for it..stick with it a while before you post those ""before"" pictures just in case you never make it to the ""after"" stage!",1107820800,159,3051,4.575091575091575

2211163,3,B0007D6V8U,"The work out time and intensity is about correct for someone totally out of shape (of course you have to pace yourself according to your condition) but it is the SAME blasted workouts for a whole month!  It can get boring.  You do alternating workouts during the week then the Saturday special.  I was only able to endure about 2.5 weeks before I found myself simply unmotivated to do the same workouts.
The good things are that it is fairly entertaining and requires no equipment aside from an inexpensive rubber resistance band.  Workouts that teach you to use your own body weight have the advantage of great portability.
The bad is that you have to go through all the disclaimers each workout and there is more than a little bit of commercials embedded in the whole thing.  One is actually kinda funny and I enjoyed watching it a couple times. (the supermarket bit)",1472083200,,869,4.65359477124183

I had lost 18 pounds by June 30 which is the day I had an accident (not related to the workouts at all) and tore three tendons in my left leg (including my Achilles) and broke two bones.  So I was laid up on the couch for 6 months and gained everything back plus a lot more.

Then on January 22, 2015 I restarted the routine.  I have been doing it nearly everyday for two months and have lost 41 pounds and even won a weight loss competition at work!  I combine it with a bicycle ride once or twice a week and some extra pushups and crunches and yoga most days.  And I eat right... but sometimes when I get a craving for something I will eat it (you won't gain it all back in one day so stop freaking out about it).  Just don't over do it and keep it healthy most of the time.

I followed it faithfully for a month and saw really good results and felt fantastic (didn't follow their diet guide provided but did change to a healthier ""eat to live"" mentality). The post workout recovery supplement was extremely effective.

Two things went wrong:  1) I got tired because when I ran out of the supplement and switched to a GNC whey protein powder. 2) I got bored because the program consists of only two workouts: an aerobics day and a resistance day. After 6 days a week for 4 weeks, looking at another 8 weeks of the same two workouts was no longer inspiring.

I find Power 90 to be a reasonably strenuous workout, comprising circuit/weight training followed by yoga/cardio. Each day can be done in an hour, and by the time you finish, you know you have worked out. People started noticing a difference in my physique within 30-40 days, and the improvements continued throughout the cycle.

A few caveats - if you want to make continuous progress, buy a set of bands or dumbbells separate so you can progress your weights upward. The 90 days of essentially 4 workouts (30 days of the 1-2 series and 60 of the 3-4 series) make for a bit of boredom and repetition. You essentially switch back and forth each day between cardio and circuit - and man, after 60 days, you know every Tony Hortonism, joke, cadence and gaffe.
