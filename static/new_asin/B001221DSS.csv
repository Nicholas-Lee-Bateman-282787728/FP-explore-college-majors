8243546,4,B001221DSS,"It is sad that America, supposedly more humane than banana republic dictators, Nazis, or communist dictators sunk to this level out of fear of a small band of Al Qaeda type terrorists. American shipped suspects to foreign countries, who carried out these tactics, while the American administration could claim ""plausible denial."" It is Sad to say that the American media played along to cover up these tactics.",1382140800,,410,5.134328358208955

8243549,3,B001221DSS,"'Extraordinary Rendition' is a pretty dark and bleak look at extraordinary rendition flights since 911. It had the feel of a crimewatch reconstruction at times and the acting was a little wooden, but the themes explored were quite shocking and Andy Serkis managed to be truly menacing in his role of interrogator. The film didn't have a conclusive ending and left me with many unanswered questions. It is relatively short at 77 minutes and it could easily have stretched to 90 and tied up these loose ends. It is a worthy film for the topic it explores alone, it's just a shame it wasn't carried out a little better. A solid 3 stars.

Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",1296604800,,704,4.5
8243550,4,B001221DSS,"This movie provides a view into the ugliness of the war in Iraq as seen from both sides, that of the invader and that of the violated citizens of a country that has been subjugated to invasion.  If for anything, it is well worth watching because it provides a balanced view of the disaster that Iraq has become.  It should serve as a healthy warning to those occupying lands against the will of the inhabitants that occupation really is a fruitless and bloody venture that cannot succeed and ends only in further fueling hatred and retaliation.",1239494400,,544,4.65625

If you say that kidnapping, torture and denying basic civil rights is evil, you may be the next target? We have by our actions internationally
become a nation with war criminals in the police forces( CIA and FBI?).
This film is pretty much the documentary of one of thousands of cases:
in this case a Pakistani college professor is kidnapped and tortured.
He was innocent and came back alive, but polarized and pretty much psychologically destroyed. Mind and body can take only so much in
even the strongest. I read a tale by a Russian where this kind of treatment was given to political prisoners: he said the best you can do
is stop eating and get very sick. They may let you live or not.
The alternative of endlessly dying and being revived is enough to break any firm spirit. The practice or deliverance of people without any
trial or real legal process to such treatment is actually recognized since WWII as a war crime by the Geneva convention ( on soldiers or civilians).
How do I feel knowing that my country which is supposed to stand for
freedom of expression and civil right is doing this kind of thing?
I'm frankly ashamed. I think if it happens to one,
then none are really safe ( on trumped up excuses or other charges).
Be afraid.",1214179200,6,1295,4.468354430379747
8243552,5,B001221DSS,"Excellent film, although it wasn't as popular as the version with Reese Witherspoon.
Nonetheless, this is a great movie! Very glad that Omar [Berdouni] is getting credit and popularity he deserves as an excellent actor.",1202688000,5,219,5.285714285714286
