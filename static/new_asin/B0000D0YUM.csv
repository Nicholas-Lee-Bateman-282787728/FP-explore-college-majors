7999655,4,B0000D0YUM,"Some may not like the topics (dealing with death, bullying).  Need to choose your audience appropriately.  However, I thought it a good movie to watch.  It doesn't have all the negativity that I avoid watching on television or other media.  Can be a segment for family talks with your teens, too.",1392163200,2,296,4.745098039215686

7999659,5,B0000D0YUM,"I like Wil Wheaton. Mainly for the reasons of: Star Trek, Stand by Me, and his books and his web blog. The acting in this movie was decent. The story line was a bit unusual. Didn't have a lot of action or special effects. However it will make you think and maybe feel something. Especially if you have ever lost someone that you loved dearly. And if you ever questioned God about why.

Sincerely yours,
Kristy Star Sisk",1231632000,,419,4.371794871794871
7999660,5,B0000D0YUM,"This is as sweet as a halmark card. (I loved the halmark store!) The story is about a man who loses his wife just as they leave the church. I would have loved to have seen the bloopers, because there were many fun actors and I'm sure that laughs weren't few. The story starts sadly and ends with a person dying for another. It's a melodrama and I loved it! It's a Thanksgiving kind of movie, but without the football players.",1183593600,2,425,4.2592592592592595
7999661,1,B0000D0YUM,"This one should be the first work from a bad movie?s student.

It?s a very good exemple about you can?t do. Probably one of the worst things I have bought ever. Don?t follow me. Don?t waist you time and money.",1144454400,,209,4.225
7999662,5,B0000D0YUM,"You take Richard Grieco (yes, I said Richard Grieco), Wil Wheaton, and Isaac Hayes... sounds like a recipe for some sort of weird comedic stew, right?  So imagine how surprised you'll be when you watch this movie and see that it actually rocks pretty hardcore.  From the interesting premise (Wheaton's character receives the Book of Days, containing everyone's dates of death, and he then has to decide if he's willing to sacrifice his own time on Earth to save those he loves) to the lovely performances given by Hayes, Wheaton, and Maureen Flannigan, this hardly even feels like a made-for-TV movie.
Forget ""The Passion of the Christ""--this is what you should be seeing to reaffirm your faith.",1080777600,8,695,4.931623931623932
