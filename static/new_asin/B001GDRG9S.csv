3610398,3,B001GDRG9S,This DVD is a good straight forward introduction to the use of a cane for self defence. The instructor clearly shows a few very simple moves clearly and concisely. He focuses on disabling the legs of an attacker to allow you to escape the situation that you are in. The biggest issue that I have is his declaration that this would be good for those who have limited mobility that requires the use of the cane for walking. In my experience in disability services and with various elderly friends those who tend to use walking canes would struggle to maintain their balance once they raised their canes up. Aside from this detail the DVD is a good starting point.,1331769600,5,661,4.563025210084033
3610399,5,B001GDRG9S,"This DVD outlines a simple yet effective method of using the cane for self-defense. A few simple moves are used in multiple scenarios, which means you have a system that can be easily learned.

A main focus of this video is practicality. There are no fancy or intricate techniques. Instead, Janich clearly teaches techniques that almost anyone can perform, regardless of one's age or physical condition. Throughout the DVD Janich gives realistic, practical advice on self-defense, which sets this video apart from other methods relying on twisting, locking, flipping, hooking, etc. --complicated methods that only a dedicated martial artist in top physical condition would have any chance of pulling off.

For the senior citizen, for the person who must use a cane, for the citizen in a restrictive locality where one cannot be legally armed, for the martial artist teaching self-defense to seniors, this is an excellent product.

I'm a dedicated practitioner of the cane and long stick, and I found much of value here. I've also studied a lot of material on the use of the cane for self-defense, and I believe this is the best.

3610402,4,B001GDRG9S,"This is a topic that is of special interest to me, and not just because of my advanced age.  I have been into the cane and/or walking stick as a weapon of practical self-defense for many years.  I have taught numerous people how to effectively use the cane and waking stick for self-defense.  I have had the opportunity to train with some of the most knowledgeable cane and walking stick experts over the years.  This DVD was interesting and most of the techniques are easy to learn.  Janich begins with an introduction to his simple cane/walking stick system, which emphasizes very easy and basic techniques.  He talks about the advantages and disadvantages of carrying a cane for self-defense.  He explains how to pick a good combat cane and covers the basic stance, balance, grips, and various striking techniques.  The basic striking combination drills are simple, practical and effective.  He stresses striking vulnerable areas of the body and shows various self-defense scenarios using the walking stick/cane.  I found one of his cane grips interesting, where he places his free hand on the wrist area of the cane hand for various power swing techniques.  However, after personally practicing his wrist hold method swings, I found his method to be unnatural for me and did not increase the power of my strikes as much as the two-hand sword grip method that I teach in my courses.  This is not to say it will not be a good grip for some people.

In conclusion, this is a  good DVD to learn the basic concepts and principles of using  the cane and/or walking stick for self-defense

3610403,3,B001GDRG9S,"While this Cd is to the point in plain language and no ""fluff"" in it I still came away feeling somewhat disappointed in regard to

3610404,5,B001GDRG9S,"Review:

If you are looking for a DVD that will show you a no-nonsense system that you can learn the basics over a weekend and you can use in the real world, this is the DVD for you.  No fancy footwork, no fancy locks, no fancy throws.  Nothing that you have to be a black belt to do.  This system is right out of the military KISS philosophy:

Keep It Simple Stupid

The system is designed for hooked or non-hooked canes and is designed for people that do not have the physical abilities of a 25 year old martial artist.  The system is based off of a simple guard.  The basic response is to thrust with the tip to the chest and follow with a two handed strike to knees or below to prevent the attacker from being able to stand and fight.  In addressing punches, he does not use blocks.  Instead he uses the cane to thrust to shoulder of the punching arm.  This greatly reduces the punch and puts the attacker off balance.

He emphasizes that you should use the cane to supplement your empty hand techniques and not to replace them.

Cons
Some people are going to say that the strikes should be more to throat and head.  Mr. Janich points out that you can do a thrust to the throat, but it is a smaller target (also there is the issue that a strike to the throat is more dangerous and if you kill or mane the attacker you will be in court).  He also points out, that the attacker will have a greater chance to block a strike to the head and could take the cane away from you and ""stick it where the sun doesn't shine"".

I wished there would have been more info regarding wrist grabs and grabs from the rear.  But again, his purpose was to do a DVD that could be learned quickley by people without martial arts experience and use in real life.  The skills he covers here will address most situations that you may encounter in life.",1279324800,17,1830,4.209770114942529
3610405,5,B001GDRG9S,This is a well done DVD. Easy to navigate through. Well-paced and packed with plenty of specific techniques that based on a simplified angles of attack. No fancy moves here. Just ones that will work in most cases. Presented concisely without much fluff. If you want some good basic moves for Cane self-defense this is a DVD worth purchasing.,1266364800,21,341,4.796610169491525
3610406,5,B001GDRG9S,"What sets Janich's Martial Cane Concepts (MCC) apart from other cane training is that it eschews most of the control techniques, flips and throws and uses some simple combinations to disable the attacker to buy time for the intended victim to safely egress. Janich begins with a target audience, a 65 year old, who may have physical limitations and devises a technique well within his capablities. What works for a 65 year old will also work with gusto for a 35 year old.

Janich describes MCC as a ""compartmentally concise self-defense system"". This clarity is reflected in a manageable number of scenarios for defense against open hands, knives and other impact weapons. Each begins from the alert, ready stance, where the cane is used as a ""shield"", a concept (de cuerdas) he incorporates from Filipino Martial Arts. If words fail, he then combines a series of non-telegraphed thrusts and strikes whose goal is to stop the threat. The series finishes with what he calls a ""mobility kill"", low level strikes which hobble the attacker and are particularly hard to block. Simple, yes, but effective. Measured, but scalable--considerations I've come to appreciate in all of Janich's work.

The production is excellent. Lighting, sound, blue back drop, appear to be the same as in his other knife training videos. The 70 minute program is laid out in a dozen or so chapters:

-Introduction
-Advantages of the Cane
-Disadvantages
-Selecting a Cane
-Basic Concepts
-Stance
-Striking
-Thrusting
-The Basic Sequence
-Applications of the Basic Sequence
-Blocking and Defending Against Weapon Attacks
-Other Defensive Cane Tactics

Some of this is rudimentary. There is no forematter that you must suffer listening to. The main menu is the first thing that is presented and one can go directly to training scenarios.

What I found quite encouraging was Janich's discussion of the importance of choosing the right cane. Some models scream ""weapon"" which may cause you grief with TSA if you intend to fly with yours. But the hook cane is both PC and effective. If anyone gives you grief, you can just throw the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) at them.

So, next time you fly or serve jury duty, take your cane.",1242086400,43,2206,4.997275204359673
3610427,5,B001GDRG9S,"I am 59 years old and require a cane for stability. I have been searching for good cane self defense products. My previous lessons include Kelly Worden's Defensive Walking Cane. It is a 2 disk set. and Alain Burrese Hapkido Cane.

First off those two lessons contain good stuff to add to my self defense program, but Martial Cane Concepts is all good. It makes sense and the moves are not more than I can do. The best part is that the moves are shown using a plain stick without the crook.

The video is first class and the moves are shown in several positions and Mr. Janich explains the moves well. It is clear that he is not interested in impressing the viewer but is showing his lesson in the most helpful way. If I had to limit myself to one lesson Martial Cane Concepts would definitely be my choice. It's worth the money.",1375315200,4,828,4.335483870967742
3610428,4,B001GDRG9S,"While I don't need to use a cane for walking, I've gotten into the habit of carrying one with me for the purpose of possible self defense, just as many ""gentlemen"" of Victorian times did. This makes more sense to me than toting a gun; a cane can be taken anywhere and is always ""locked and loaded"", so to speak.  The system demonstrated in this video is simple, quick and dirty, if you will, and easy for most to quickly learn.  Indeed, many of the fancy locks, holds, multi-moves, etc. that I've observed and tried from other videos would be mostly useless for those who actually need a cane to walk with...and they are too complex to remember if you don't practice them religiously day in and day out anyway.  This system only requires that you learn 5, basic moves and a ""guard"" position that can serve a person well in open areas and/or tight spaces.  These moves are easy to learn, remember, and can pack a significant punch, when properly delivered, even by those who are experiencing waning, physical strength and dexterity.  Of course, one possible caveat to consider regarding any cane self defense system; I can't help wondering how many potential muggers, out there, may be learning these various cane systems, too.",1368403200,6,1226,4.710280373831775

3610433,5,B001GDRG9S,"A simple,effective and easy to learn system that can be mastered by most people with basic physical abilities. This is not about stick fighting or defeating a highly trained opponent in the ring, it's about whacking some lowlife across the shin and getting away. In my experience, most street thugs have little martial training and are looking for an easy mark.  If you can show an effective, determined defense, they will look elsewhere.  Think of it this way, any of us can kill a wasp with a swat of the hand, but is it worth getting stung?  Traditional martial arts are geared towards combat with a black belt of the same discipline;  progress is slow,  the moves must be perfect or your adversary will exploit the smallest weakness, you must be prepared for a wide variety of techniques many of which require considerable physical prowess.  I studied Aikido Jo for a while, typically it takes one to two years to learn to do a simple overhead strike to the master's satisfaction.  Janisch system consists of three basic strikes and a simple sequence.  While you will need to practice regularly and seriously with any skill you depend on for defense, after 20 minutes of practice with Janich' system, you will already have something useful.  No basic system can prepare you for all and any kind of attack but it can give you good chances against the most likely ones.  Also, no system is suitable for every kind of disability but this one doesn't ask much in terms of athletic ability.  There has been criticism that the material is limited.  That's the point!  Three basic strikes and one sequence is what you need to know.  Practice diligently until they become reflexive and the thieves will find some other honey pot to rob.",1355356800,5,1732,4.73

8305086,2,B001GDRG9S,"The video claims it is for the 65 year old man or woman without martial arts training.  The martial is well presented.  Though it is listed as ""cane"" techniques the majority of techniques are shown with a stick which is not what an older person would carry for assistance.  If the older person has some disability they would be carrying a cane for assistance which would also limit their ability to use it for self defense if their balance depended on the cane.  Though the author says the video techniques are for the 65 year old he more than once qualifies/or confuses the issue by mentioning the physical attributes as a possible limitation of the cane holder and then does the techniques with a stick, not a cane.  If the video claims, as it does, to be for the 65 year old man or woman the system should fully and accurately address the needs of that age group.  The video does not address that need sufficiently.  For example:  1. show the techniques (Janich system) with a cane, not a stick  2. fully take into account several techniques for those who those 65 yr olds who do depend on the cane for balance and are not in good physical condition.  3. the speed and strength of a 65 yr old or older, especially with some level of disability, is considerably less than a younger, stronger, faster attacker that they might face.  4.  In the video it is shown where the end of the stick is grabbed with two hands by an attacker and how to release the attack.  This release action will NOT work in the majority of cases, especially tried by an elderly person against a stronger opponent and the defender may unbalance themselves further.  5. many of the techniques are shown as full swing strikes which would be difficult for disabled 65 yr olds or older.  These strikes would be weak, reduce wielding a second strike or easily countered.  They would be slower and more difficult with a heavier stick used by a 65 yr old or older.  Better strikes than these would be to short strikes which are then retracted.  This would not compromise balance as much, would allow a 2nd or 3rd strike if needed, and present less opportunity for a counter of stick grab .  6.  distancing, footwork for the elderly needs to be addressed more and with scenarios of a true 65 yr old with a CANE  facing a younger, stronger, faster attacker.
Though this video is of interest to the younger, physically capable person who wants to learn simple cane & stick defenses I feel that this video does little to meet the needs of it's claimed 65 yr old audience.  Giving an elderly cane carrying person a false sense of security is not a service.  Emphasis should be placed on how much practice a an older person needs to attain and maintain a given level of competence.
In closing, Mr. Janich, who has notabkle expertise in th defense arts,  tries to serve a given stated audience but I feel he needs in later volumes to truly rethink his system and gear the techniques to the disabled or 65 yr old or older person carrying a cane.  This video though instructive and clearly presented falls short of its goals in many areas.",1445817600,7,3098,4.508960573476703

8305090,5,B001GDRG9S,"There are a handful of good cane defense DVDs out there and I would rank this one as a clear winner in a number of areas.
1. This is geared at those people who are most likely to need a cane.  This is not dojo stuff.  There's really nothing fancy here.  Just a solid set of defense tactics for those who want to make it home alive.
2. This one of the few cane defense DVDs where the instructor actually covers some of the DIS-advantages of the cane [mostly the inability to swing it in small confined areas] and deliberately tailors a defensive plan to meet that problem.
3. Rather than cover all possible attacks and asking you to remember how to defend against each [trust me, you won't remember], this DVD gives you a solid, simple, practical plan to use against nearly any frontal attack.

If you're looking for a truly practical instructional DVD on how to use a cane, this is really the best out there.  I've trained in martial arts for nearly forty years and now I find myself instructing my wife on how to protect herself.  The first thing I've learned in training her and other seniors and those with disabilities is that they either do not have the patience and retention to learn the more intricate hapkido cane forms, or they lack the physical ability.  I've learned to concentrate on on this form almost entirely, with a few special techniques to use with attacks from the rear.

A great DVD.  Expensive?  Yes.  But if you really want a solid defense and don't want to spend much much more sampling everything that's out there [I have], this is the one to buy.

One last remark.  Contrary to the instructor's idea of the ideal cane, I would caution you to avoid buying a fully weaponized cane from someplace like Cane Masters.  I'm talking about things like fanged crooks, knife edged shafts, shark's teeth, etc.  Stick to a cane that has a crook and looks like a cane and pass on the shark's teeth and knife edge and toothed hook.  First of all, you can do everything with a regular hardwood [very important] cane with a slightly chiseled point on the crook that you can do with any of he fancier, more weaponized versions.  Secondly, in any real encounter, you have to face the fact that ultimately, after a physical confrontation, you will very probably have to justify your actions to a court of law.  Criminally, a charge of excessive force is not at all unlikely if you use a highly weaponized cane.  Also, you may have to face a civil suit after the fact, and a jury that sees that you were simply defending yourself with a cane that looks like something you actually use to support yourself and not as a lethal weapon that skirts the concealed carry laws if far more likely to find in your favor.",1398816000,15,2717,4.485772357723577
