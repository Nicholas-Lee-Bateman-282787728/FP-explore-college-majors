37089,5,0782010792,"A beautiful story, well told through the vision of Frank Capra.  It is the story of a very typical middle-class man.  He lives in the future dreaming of what his life will be, not seeing what it is.  He lives for when life  will become his dream.  Then he is given a rare gift---a chance to see the  truth of his life through the open and loving heart of his guardian angel.  He then begins to understand that his true life was what was going on while  waiting for his life to start.  And, he gets to do this when there is still  a chance to change.  We all have this watershed event, albeit not all of us  see it.  The truth is always right in front of us, but it is very scary to  see.  So, like George Bailey we dream about what it should be and wait for  that to happen.  George opens himself to the truth and finds his true love  and happiness.  Would that we could all have such a wonderful life.",911606400,,902,4.0227272727272725

I did not think I would like the colorized version.  I was wrong.  I found myself examining the beautiful colors in the clothing and the background.

The bonus making of featurette is from the 80s or 90s and looks very dated, but is interesting nonetheless. This set also includes the colorized version. I have to say it doesnt look so great. The opening credits look fantastic, but the colorized version just looks fake. Stick with the original b&w version.

37245,5,0782010792,this movie is one of the best of its time it carries a Christmas movie moniker but it really isn't a Christmas movie although you can show it at Christmas time and it fits very well because this movie is offered in both color and black-and-white I feel it's time for a little history about this movie the fact is for political reasons this picture nearly wasn't made Frank Capra fell in love with this script he didn't really want to make a politically charged movie but that's what it ended up being you see the movie was written from the point of view of the Working Man and there's an awful lot of speech is that George Bailey gives that come off from the working man's point of view and aren't very complimentary of the banking industry so the political climate at the time these were fighting words and very unpopular so the funding for this movie was almost impossible to come by Frank Capra ended up having to finance it himself largely if not completely some of the details are a little foggy so because color was so drastically expensive it had to be shot in black and white the money just wasn't there to shoot it in Technicolor and the fact is that any movie shot in black-and-white meant time was  strictly a financial reasoning not artistic decisions were made to shoot in black and white as was the case with any movie that wasn't expected to make the production cost back that it took the shooting color if you were to go back in time and offer the seed money to have these movie shot and color believe me they would have shot them in color it was not an artistic at all if you'll take the time to read your history you'll find out that I'm telling you the truth so all of this controversy about colorized movies really is quite laughable there's only 1 person I know of the shot in black and white for artistic reasons Woody Allen Mel Brooks in Young Frankenstein shot in black and white because the movie he was spoofing he was spoofing was originally shot in black and white shooting Young Frankenstein in color would have been totally inappropriate now onto the movie It's a Wonderful Life this is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest pictures and if you're Jimmy Stewart fan it's a must the transfer of this movie is absolutely excellent 1080p does it justice it literally jumps off the screen the sound is excellent the movie is blemishless remastering was a masterpiece Frank Capra is a genius and this movie is one of his finest works In almost anyone's opinion this is a must-have for anyone that serious about collecting these kinds  movies the colorized version is excellent and 1080p makes it look even better you will not go wrong in buying this movie having both in the same package for this price and 1080p you just can't go wrong I bought this movie right before Christmas and Amazon delivered it on time intact and for a good price that you can't beat that please forgive my history lesson but I'm getting a little tired of hearing about the controversy about colorizing movies it's not like they're destroying the original black-and-white Masters when they do it they're not if you don't want to watch the colorized version give it away to somebody but this movie is a bargain at this price having both on two separate discs and not one on top of the other that's a disaster it's an absolutely excellent shot of Americana and frankly I'm a history nut and it's a pretty doggone accurate slice of Americana everyone should know what those times were like besides the movie is super entertaining warm and heartfelt I highly recommend it thank you for taking the time to read my review if you did I hope it's helpful,1515196800,,3639,4.495468277945619

All these little details in the scene that weren't apparent in Black&White really enhance each scenes depth. Looks incredible!

37268,5,0782010792,"This year I seemed to O.D. on Christmas classics well, OK, I watched two of them. I posted my review of (Scrooge) on Christmas day, and watched this one the following day.

It was first released in 1947, and stars Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore. This is the original black and white version that was released in 1947. The story is set in the small town of Bedford Falls. Steward plays George Bailey, and one of the earlier scenes shows them sledding, and George saving his brothers life when he goes through the ice. Georges father (honestly!) runs the local savings and loan, helping people to buy homes they would not otherwise be able to afford.

Lionel Barrymore plays Potter, the evil greedy businessman who seeks to keep everyone dependent upon him. He sees the savings and loan, first run by Georges father, and then later by George, as a threat to his ultimate dominance, and seeks to destroy it. Weave in some thwarted ambition, as George had his sights set on seeing the world, and building big things. Of course, there must be more than a dash of romance, as George, in a roundabout way, woos Donna Reed. A decent wooing, as it is always interesting to note how much or how little the social morals of the time limit, or not, the amount of skin shown.

The nefarious Potter does gain the upper hand, and is on the point of destroying George and his family. George contemplates suicide, and that is when his guardian angel comes to the rescue. The angel presents a time-honored fantasy: how would the world be if George had never been born?  In a nutshell, much poorer, since he helped many people at key points in their lives, for example, that brother he fished out of the icy pond, who would go on to win the Medal of Honor in World War II.

And the friends come to the rescue saving the day, and helping him overcome his financial difficulties. Sure, it is a bit schmaltz, but to everything there is a season, like the current one. 5-stars, for Georges eternal story, and may it be true in real life, as well.",1514332800,4,2039,4.5

So I paid for a two disc set, (one black and white, and one colorized) and couldn't even see the entire movie.  Now, this wasn't an accident folks.

37352,5,0782010792,"I always thought that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was a great movie and it's especially good to watch during the Christmas holidays.  Strangely enough it was not particularly well received when it was released and only gained in popularity after a time had passed and people finally realized its worth.
The story of what a man realizes what the world would have been like without him causes him to understand how important the things he has done have actually benefitted so many people around him.  It's a movie I could watch over and over.",1504569600,,536,4.691489361702128
37353,1,0782010792,This movie is not in color .  Do not be fooled by the colored picture on the front .  2 thumbs down,1503878400,,99,3.4545454545454546

37355,5,0782010792,"""It's a Wonderful Life"", initially greeted with meager enthusiasm by the movie going public, who thought it too depressing for a Christmas film, finally came into its own when the days of TV syndication came along. It was given an extra boost due to the fact that through inattention, the copyright ran out! When TV stations realized they could show it with no royalties due, it became a popular item in their schedules. Movie fans, with a second chance to appreciate this film, found that they liked it after all. Once you understand that George Bailey's life is full and rich, even if it never followed the course he himself had imagined for it, you understand that the movie isn't depressing at all. No matter how many times I view ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I still get a little choked up at the end.

This was Jimmy Stewart's first film role after serving in, literally, heroic fashion as a bomber commander during World War II. Despite being a star and subject to assignment in ""morale roles"" if he had so chosen, Stewart went into the Air Corp and flew a complete tour of 25 bomber missions. He also flew a number of other live missions that were tallied as flights where he trained air crews. When offered the chance to have those missions count against his tour of 25, he declined. If you know anything about the history of WWII, you know that bomber crew duty in the European theater was pretty much the most dangerous combat assignment in the war.

This DVD presentation is extremely well done. Whether from a clean print or a masterful restoration (or a combination of the two), the movie is free of artifacts of the type you find in old film prints or a rushed digital transfer. When you compare the actual film to scenes shown as examples in the two included documentaries, you can see what I mean.

And mentioning the two documentaries, they are very satisfying. One is hosted by Frank Capra Jr., the son of the famous director of the film. He narrates interesting facts about his father and this film in particular in a warm tone that makes you feel part of the process. The second feature is hosted by Tom Bosley (the father on ""Happy Days""). That documentary is, I believe, somewhat longer. It goes into some of the casting choices that could have been made, which I always find interesting. Both have tidbits of history and trivia about the film that are anywhere from interesting to fascinating ... including an explanation of how the film was actually shot during a record heat wave!

""It's a Wonderful Life"" has become arguably the top Christmas classic, in part due to its heavy exposure on TV, and in part because the film is so good it holds up under that heavy exposure very well. It is a must see for our family every Christmas season, and I have to say that I'm happy to own a DVD with a presentation of this high quality, so that I'm not subject to the random quality of prints shown on TV broadcasts.",1503360000,4,2928,4.5397727272727275

Andrews Blu-ray Review: On 21st December, 1946, Frank Capra and James Stewart held the world premiere for ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE in New York at the Globe Theater. The film, is now a true festive holiday classic and a television staple event every year, and was nominated for five Oscars at the 19th Academy Awards ceremony.

ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is a wonderful title for a motion picture about which practically everyone who sees it will agree that it is a truly wonderful entertainment. The film marks Frank Capra's first production since his return from distinguished war service, and he has invested it with the tremendous heart that always stamps his offerings as above average. This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the dominant factor at every turn of situation. His direction of the individual characterizations delivered is also distinctively his, and the performances, from the starring roles of James Stewart and Donna Reed down to the smallest bit, are magnificent. When Frank Capra is at his best, no one can top him.

The story opens imaginatively upon Heavenly constellations that are twinkling and conversing. They are talking about a fellow down on earth that requires some guidance. To provide him the help he needs, a neophyte angel, still in the process of earning his wings, is dispatched to take over the case of George Bailey. But before he starts he has to know considerable about George's early life.

When he was merely a youth, George Bailey jumped into a freezing lake to save his brother from drowning. This act brought partial deafness to George Bailey, a disability that kept him out of the army when World War II came along. Meanwhile, he had married his childhood sweetheart and was raising a little family of his own in a typically American small-town community called Bedford Hills. He had taken over the management of the building and loan association and was bucking a local Scrooge who had jockeyed him into a position where he could be dealt misery. All these troubles came to a head during a Christmas season.

It was then that George Bailey, in a moment of weakness, wished he had never been born. The fellow angel from Heaven, named Clarence, who was assigned to watch out for him, granted that wish. In the fantastic events that follow George Bailey is brought to a realisation of how much his apparently aimless existence has meant to others and he retracts his wish. For showing him the futility of feeling futile, Clarence is rewarded with a beautiful pair of wings. Frank Capra's trick rests in the fulsome manner in which he allows a motion picture audience to share in the glory.

The musical score to accompany this story was written and directed by Dmitri Tiomkin and its value to the narrative is frequently out of this world. You will look far to find a finer score for a dramatic film. The photography by Joseph Walker, the credit for its completion shared by operative cameraman Joseph Biroc, is superior on all counts. So is the small-town atmosphere captured by the art direction and other technical aids are superb. This is indeed a brilliant start for the company that calls itself Liberty Films and is headed by Capra, George Stevens, William Wyler and Samuel J. Briskin.

James Stewart is distinctively and perfect acting as the character of George Bailey, his initial role in Hollywood after five years in the armed forces. James Stewart gives Frank Capra everything that is asked for, and he does it with the real authority of understatement. Donna Reed lends lovable personality to the childhood sweetheart he marries, ever a typical American wife and mother. No one could have bettered Henry Travers in the richly amusing part of the angel Clarence.

Then there is the superb Lionel Barrymore making the town banker even more of a Scrooge than anyone else could have. Thomas Mitchell is a splendid drunken Uncle Billy and Beulah Bondi a glorious mother for George. The kid brother is tellingly played by Todd Karns, of whom more will be heard, and the girl who is his romance is neatly portrayed by Virginia Patton. Performing the girl who has been given a bad name in town, Gloria Grahame will win a lot of personal attention.

Small-town characters are brought to vivid life by Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, H.B. Warner, Frank Albertson, Charles Williams, Mary Treen and Sarah Edwards. A stunning gem is that of a bartender by Sheldon Leonard. The roles of the central characters as children are sharply done by Bobbie Anderson, Ronnie Ralph, Jean Gale and Jeanine Ann Roose. George Bailey's children are respectively Carol Coomes, Karolyn Grimes, Larry Simms and Jimmy Hawkins, and are all excellent.

ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE achieves a fine balancing act between pathos and feel-good that is delivered by an outstanding cast. Even the minor parts are populated by some of the finest character actors and it produces a movie of timeless quality and relevance. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE isn't just a festive holiday favourite, but a great film by almost any standards. There are a few cynics who will disparage this film, but, in a ""feel good"" genre clogged with imitators and inferior features, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE stands high above the rest. Whether you view this film in the middle of the summer or at Christmas, Frank Capra's greatest film represents one of the most transcendent and joyful experiences any movie-lover can hope for. It is truly a ""feel good"" film, but a word of warning, please have the box of Kleenex tissues handy, as you will experience an emotional rollercoaster of this unique magic of motion picture.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Liberty Films and Universal Pictures presents this wonderful Blu-ray disc in stunning 1080p black-and-white and colour images that reflect a quantum leap beyond the original inferior DVD version and both versions are of the highest quality calibre. The added sharpness and broader contrast in the Black-and-White version really helps when reading fine details on faces and absorbing wide shots and the contrast is just totally perfect, with very good detailing and texture. To top things off, the print is close to near perfect condition, noticeably cleaner than the original inferior DVD presentation, with far less visible dust, dirt and nicks on the print. Simply put, this film has never looked as good as it does here on this Platinum Anniversary Edition Blu-ray disc. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Liberty Films and Universal Pictures has brought out this wonderful Blu-ray disc with a brilliant 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo audio presentation, and is of course a vast improvement over the inferior DVD release. Dialogue is very clear at all times, and thankfully fixes the audio defects that hampered the original inferior DVD version, which caused the sound to occasionally take on a horrible annoying muffled quality. So all in all this is again a very clean audio track, especially with no popping, no scratches, or other age related defects. Again the strong audio fidelity maintains sharp dialogue with a pleasant maturity from its original 71 year old release in the cinema. Brilliant moments to reflect, is of course the wonderful music film score and especially the ambience audio track enhances of the passing of the cars to the front of the soundstage; partially creating the illusion that they are moving past you. The dance hall scene has surprisingly potent low end information and it all sounds quite respectable for a 71 year old film. So well done Liberty Films and Universal Pictures for a professional job all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Picture Comparison: Here we get to compare the Colorized images with the Black-and-White images simultaneously to compare which you feel is the best image. To me the Colorization wins hands down and stands out the best for me, as I feel you get a much more impressive and greater depth of field in its presentation, as well being in colour I feel you get a much more image clarity, which is my personal preference. But do not feel I am down grading the Black-and-White images you view, as they are of good contrast in its different shades you get from a Black-and-White image presentation and at least you have the choice of watching the two different presentations and for you to decide which version you prefer to watch. But once again for me personally I prefer to watch the Colorized version and my mind is a much more enjoyable experience and made me so much more sympathetic and empathy to all the characters in the film. But what I thought they would do is just give short clips of the film to compare the different versions, but instead you have to watch the whole film.

Theatrical Trailer [1946] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:43] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE in Black-and-White. What a shame they could not of re-mastered this film trailer.

Special Feature: Trivia Tracks: Here once again you get to view the whole film, but this time I viewed it in Black-and-White. But the difference this time with watching the film, is that at the bottom of the screen you get white subtitles giving you unknown trivia information about the film ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, and here we get the in-depth information on why this film has become such a firm favourite for all age groups who love to view this film and its wonderful philosophy and outlook on life in general and here is what you read: In 2004, the BBCTV listings magazine Radio Times conducted a poll into the Best Film Never to have Won an Oscar; ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE came second, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION 1994] was first. Before ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, snow was created using painted cornflakes, unfortunately, the flakes would make so much noise, that any dialogue would have to be dubbed in later in postproduction, but frank Capra wanted to record the sounds live, so a new snow effect was created, using foamite, a chemical used to fight fires, soap and water. The mixture was then pumped through a wind machine to create falling snow. Over 6,000 gallons were used during the production and the effects department at RKO was awarded a special award by the Motion Picture Academy. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranks this film as the number 20 greatest movie of all time. Despite being set around Christmas, it was filmed during a heat wave, and it got to be so hot that frank Capra gave everyone a day off to rest, especially wearing heavy winter clothes. It was the one of the longest sets that had ever been made for an American movie. The RKO Pictures Encino Ranch and consisted of 89 acres and The Hunchback of Notre Dame [1939] and dozens of other classic films used the facility. It includes 75 shops and buildings, Main Street, factory district and a large residential and slum area. The main Street was 300 yards long. In 1947, an FBI analyst submitted, without comment, an addition to a running memo, on Communist infiltration of the Motion Picture Industry, in recording the opinion of an industry source who said that the films obvious attempt to discredit bankers is a common trick used by the Communists. The film has two lines of secret dialogue, spoken quietly through the door. They can be heard when amplifying the volume, and are also explicitly depicted in the closed-captioning. The lines occur at the end of the scene set in Baileys office with Bailey and his son George, and Potter and his good present. After George raves at Potter that, You cant say that about my father, George is shown out of the room by his father, then George is shown standing outside the office door. At that moment, George overhears the following two lines of dialogue through the pane of glass door behind him. Potter: Whats the answer? Bailey: Potter, you just humiliated me in front of my son. This was James Stewarts first film after finishing his service in World War II. Initially he rejected the part feeling it was too soon after coming home to return to work, but was convinced to take the role by Lionel Barrymore. For the scene that required Donna Reed to throw a big stone into the window of the Granville House, Frank Capra hired a marksman to shoot it out the window on her cue. But Donna Reed actually broke the window with the stone first time, and did not require the assistant of the hired marksman! A rumour that had been doing the rounds is that the Pink Floyd Album Wish You Were here can be played alongside the film with key events in the movie tying in with the song lyrics. In the film, as Uncle Billy is leaving Georges house drunk, it sounds as if he stumbles over some rubbish bins on the pavement, in fact a crew member dropped some equipment at the same time as Uncle Billy left the screen, while carrying on with the scene by saying, Im all right, Im all right! And frank Capra decided to use it in the final cut and he gave a clumsy stagehand a $10 bonus for improving the sound. This film is one of several films for the actress Beulah Bondi portrayed James Stewarts mother, and the other films were Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939], Of Human Hearts [1938] and Vicious Lady [1938], and once in his television series The Jimmy Stewart Show [1971]. Frank Capra strove to make scenes as real as he could for the actors, thus the first kiss between Stewart and Reed was shot at the same time, as the other end of the phone conversation with Sam Wainwright [Frank Albertson] on a different set in Wainwrights New York office at RKOs Path Studio. James Stewart was nervous about the phone scene kiss because it was his first screen kiss since his return to Hollywood after the war. Stewart filmed the scene in only one unrehearsed take, and it worked so well, that part of the embrace was cut, because it was too passionate to be approved by the censors. James Stewart cited George bailey as being his favourite character and when Frank Capra inherited the project, he wrote it for James Stewart. The name Bedford Falls was combined from Bedford Hills in Westchester County, New York, and Seneca Falls, a small town midway between Rochester and Syracuse. The town of Elmira mentioned by the bank examiner, is a real town in New York. While filming the scene where George prays in the bar, James Stewart has said that he was overcome, that he began to sob during filming of the scene. Later, Frank Capra reframed the shot so it looked like a much closer shot that was actually filmed, because he wanted to catch that expression on Stewarts face. The scene on the bridge where Clarence saves George was filmed on a back lot on a day where the temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit and if you look closely, you can see that James Stewart is perspiring profusely in a few scenes. When Officer Bert shoots at George, the S, V and I in the electric Pottersville sign far away in the distance, go out. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is ranked as the Number One Most Powerful Movie of All Time by the American Film Institute in 2006. The Bells of St. Mary [1945] film is showing at the cinema as George runs down the street in Bedford Falls, well Henry travers who place Clarence the angel, starred in that film as Horace P. Bogardus. According to an interview with Karolyn Grimes, the actress who plays Zuzu [The Bailey Child], well the name comes from Zu Zu Ginger Snaps [1901] that George makes reference to this near the end of the film, where he says to Zuzu, Zuzu, my little ginger snaps! ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE originally ended with Ode to Joy, not Auld Lang Syne. The song Auld Lang Syne is sung at the end of the movie when the townspeople have come to Jimmy Stewarts rescue, the same song is sung towards the beginning of the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939] at the banquet honouring Jimmy Stewarts appointment to the Senate. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE was voted the Number One inspirational film of all time, in the AFIs 100 Years . . . 100 Cheers on the 14th June, 2006.

Finally, I am really glad that I took the opportunity to sit down and finally watch ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE in its entirety without any interruption and I was able to finally see what I had been missing with this film, as I had only previously caught bits and pieces when it was broadcast on television during the Christmas festivities, so I had never really payed much attention to it until now. This Platinum Anniversary Edition release is absolutely beautiful.  Being an upgraded remastered version of the film, you can definitely tell that they have put the necessary work into this Blu-ray release to allow you to feel you are watching the most original feel to the 1946 film.  Both the visual and audible experiences allowed for an appreciative experience that I can now truly appreciate and enjoy this film and every beautiful aspect of the whole magical film experience. The Platinum Anniversary Edition of this film really is one that should be in your Blu-ray collection as it includes both black-and-white and colourized versions of the film and it is the only way to get both versions in a single release. The inspirational, thoroughly festive ending is guaranteed to bring tears to the eyes, so have those Kleenex tissues at hand, as you will need them. Highly Recommended!

Lot of great extras here including not only the B&W version but a colorized version as well.

Watching It's a Wonderful Life is a Christmas Eve tradition, so I decided to upgrade to a Blu-Ray version. Am I glad I did! With this platinum edition you get that movie with extras features, plus the colorized version, and it's less than the regular DVD. I call that a real bargain. I read somewhere that they used the surplus mashed potato flakes from WWII for the snow in this film. If you have your surround sound on, you can hear the ""crunching"" in some scenes of this Christmas classic.",1482796800,,569,4.377358490566038

At end of the sequence with Donna Reed in the bushes, Jimmy Stewart tells her that in order to get her robe back, she has to come out and get it.  The line is cut in the version they play on television now, which has been driving me crazy for years, so I bought the blu-ray because I expected it to be complete and uncut.  It's not, which is very disappointing.  I suspect this line was cut because it offended somebody's delicate sensibilities.",1482710400,42,513,4.425531914893617

37670,5,0782010792,"If you want to buy the  latest set, that includes the best quality colorized technology, plus a pristine black and white original one, plus extras, this is it.  Make sure it says Platinum Anniversary and was released in 2016, because Amazon offers other versions and includes the ratings for all on one page.

We bought it to replace an older poorer quality colorized version.  I do understand that many do not like to see the older black and white movies colorized, but this one is really special in color.  Nothing garish.  Just seems so much more natural.  In some ways the colorized scenes in the early part of the movie bring life to it, and then when George is given the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born, the color is much more subdued and really adds to over all effect of the story.

I love that you can watch both and compare for yourself.

We watched this one once, right after it arrived,  then gave it away to someone who had only seen the movie once, in the older colorized version.

I have already ordered another copy of this one for us.  Always a great movie.",1482710400,3,1115,4.385365853658537

37707,5,0782010792,"They just don't make them like this anymore, do they?

Not surprisingly, Hollywood has stolen from Frank Capra for years, but you can't recreate classy talents like Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. The former made a career out of projecting the everyday man. He is never better than he is here as George Bailey... An idealistic man with big dreams that always ends up sacrificing himself and his desires for the greater good of everyone. His friends and family go on to do bigger and ""better"" things while he sticks around to keep the small town afloat by running the bank and preventing the grouchy scrooge like character Mr. Potter from taking over the town and controlling all of it.

Eventually it gets to be too much and our hero contemplates suicide because he doesn't feel that he had accomplished anything. This period in the film is where Stewart really shows his depth as an actor. He is often known for his awww shucks characters, but he is really impressive during the characters darkest moments. His performance is so good that you forget that you're watching a film for a brief time despite the fact that you probably figured how this would end before even seeing the film. But the ability to make the audience suspend disbelief is the sign of good acting.

Donna Reed is great also. She is a great combination of sex appeal, classic, femininity, smarts and vulnerability. How could any man feel Mary Bailey as a wife? But, that's the point of the story, isn't it? Or hero George needs to learn to see what everyone else see's. The tale might seem predictable in retrospect, but the journey is still well worth taking. This is easily one of the best Holiday movies EVER. Perhaps even the best.",1481760000,5,1704,4.6544850498338874

I decided to purchase the Blu-ray version to see how good it could look on my 50"" HD TV.  The movie arrived today and I couldn't wait to pop the disk into my player to see if the picture quality is as good as other reviews say it is.  OMG!!!  I could not believe the richness of the color.  I own some other old movies that were converted to Blu-ray and I have to say this is the best production I've seen.  The other movies were still grainy.  I only watch a couple scenes briefly but what I saw was crisp and clean; like the movie was released recently and this is the first release on disk.  I can't wait to sit the whole family down to watch the movie.  This is an excellent version of the movie, plus it contains both the colorized version and black and white version to satisfy the purist who loves B&W and those who like color.",1480464000,8,942,4.098360655737705

But, it's the Colorized version that blew me away... much better than older attempts, and good enough that you occasionally forget you are NOT watching the original film! Wow. I've seen IAWL over 60 times, but the color disc revealed things I've never seen before. Sometimes merely interesting background items (mounted butterflies on the wall at the family home), but other times more significant differences (the changes in Violet's outfits throughout the film). The color version more eloquently displays the difference in attire between the Bailey's and their wealthier friends the Wainwright's, and makes certain scenes entirely more lifelike (color travel posters and glowing fire in the ""honeymoon suite"").

I'm looking forward to watching IAWL again. And, next time, it will be the color version again.",1480377600,25,901,5.345070422535211

37770,5,0782010792,"This is my husband's favorite Christmas movie. He remembers sitting down with his family every year to watch it at least a few times around Christmas. So when we got married we had to carry on that tradition with my daughter as well.

  It is a movie about a man who dreams of a bigger world but ends up a very busy business man (after taking over his father's company) with no time for his family or wife. One night he makes a wish and he regrets it, that he had never been born. He gets to see how his town would be if he hadn't been there to invoke his influence on the town. It makes him realize that he has accomplished much more than he thought.

  It's A Wonderful Life is a great movie to watch around Christmas(or when you forget how much you mean to your family and friends). When parents are stressing about buying their kids the best gifts, kids are stressing about getting the best gifts etc. It is a very heart warming movie to remind us no matter how stressful life is, life is about family, friends and what you have not what you want.

  This particular set also includes a black and white version for those who remember it as a child, and a color version for those to enjoy it as tv is now mostly all color.

You will laugh and cry  as ""George"" explores his town from a completely different aspect..... as if he had never been born.",1473897600,2,1350,4.214007782101167

37814,4,0782010792,"It's a Wonderful Life is one of my favorite movies.

Disclaimer:  I no longer celebrate Christmas because based on research, it is very clear that Christmas contains a lot of pagan stuff and I believe the Bible is quite clear that those pagan practices are things that I should not be involved in.  Furthermore, I know Yeshua (Jesus) was not born on December 25th.  Instead, he was probably born on or during Sukkot (The Festival/Feast of Tabernacles).  Also, no, I don't think angels get wings when a bell rings.  ;-)

Okay, despite how I feel about Christmas, I really enjoy It's a Wonderful Life.  I like the realness of the movie, that life can be hard and dreams and plans don't always work out.  Things happen.  There are many truths in the movie.  For example, you can love your kids, but the stress of life gets to you and you can hurt the ones you love or say something you didn't mean to.  Also, living a life of giving and thinking of others often pays for itself later, maybe when you least expect it.  There is definitely food for thought in the movie.

The DVD itself that I received is not pictured the one Amazon shows.  The DVD is quite good with THX sound, digital restoration, extras, and so on.  A Blu-ray release might be better now (mid 2016), especially if the 2006 60th Anniversary Blu-ray contains the original B&W as well as the colorized versions of the movie, which I think is the case.",1464307200,,1414,4.486274509803922

Starring actor Jimmy Stewart is great; but the rest of the cast is also superb.  This '60th Anniversary Edition' also has two interesting extra background feature 'shorts' about the film: one is narrated by Tom Bosley, and the other is narrated by Capra's son.  Both have interview clips with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra discussing aspects of the movie.

37944,5,0782010792,"Well, this is by far my favorite movie for the Christmas season.  This movie has inspired millions and every time I watch it , I am brought to tears.  I am amazed at what they did in this film.  Instead of reflecting upon all the things that John Bailey did not do in life, they put a twist on the film and see what life would have been if he had never existed.  This is a movie that captivates you, and entertains you, but at the same time, as the biblical term Selah goes, makes you stop, think, and reflect.  Unfortunately, this movie is being moved off TV much during Christmas and being replaced by newer films.  However, it will always remain in my collection, and always be part of my holiday tradition.  Sometimes in life, we need to cry, to release our pain, this movie will move you, and the tears will flow.  5 Stars!",1453334400,,828,4.262820512820513

37990,5,0782010792,"One of my Christmas staples is watching ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which was produced WELL before my time, but like anyone who has an appreciation for the film will tell you, it just doesn't matter.

I love having the option of choosing between color and black & white.  Although if you're a die hard black & white fan of this movie, there's another Blu-ray release from 2011 (I think), which has the black & white film in widescreen.

This colorization is the newest version made from 2007 by Legend films.  I think they did an absolute miraculous job colorizing the film.  I was looking ""fairly"" closely through certain parts, and didn't notice anything that wasn't right.  Absolute perfect job.

Anyway, I now no longer need to search and scan through all the channels at Christmas time.  I've got my own copy I can load up whenever I want!  That's what I cared about!",1451865600,2,869,4.627450980392157

I was very disappointed, because I already owned this movie and bought this version for the Chinese dub so I could watch it with my non-English-speaking relatives.",1451433600,,374,4.597014925373134
37999,5,0782010792,"I'm not certain a review of this movie is even helpful.  It is a holiday classic.  What else is there to say really.

Well, as it turns out I do have a few things.  This is actually the first time I remember seeing this movie and I really thought it would mostly be sentimental and maybe a bit slow.  It definitely has a lot of sentimentality but it is not slow and the jokes and comedy within the movie were met by out loud laughter from even my kids (both under the age of 13) so the humor and message is still relevant today.

Anyway, this is a great movie.  Watch it with your family but be warned your wife will probably cry and if you have a husband he won't admit it but he will probably be crying too and you will all be laughing at parts and feeling really good in the end.",1451433600,,782,4.006451612903226

38040,5,0782010792,"This classic movie lapsed into public domain after being under appreciated in its release time. This is as
pristine of a picture and audio you're likely to ever see.
You just cannot watch THIS Blu-Ray TOO often [it has a seperate disc in fake-color]. I still cannot get that
white hair floating like a cloud over the old dude's head in the wheelchair]. In fact, next time you see this
flick on broadcast TV, pull this BLACK'n'WHITE Blu-Ray out instead. Stick it in your Blu-ray-player; ring a
bell; grab some chips or popcorn; drink your choice of beverage; and remember that things REALLY COULD
be worse... just wait! It M=A=Y get worse before it gets better... but, isn't that what movies are for? There's
NEVER been a better time to make you want to FORGET... or REMEMBER some fantasy scenereo past...
while you sit on your butt and wish things w-e-r-e better. All of the people in this movie are dead now, except
the little bell-ringing girl, and she's older than ME.

I bought this version of the movie because it had this extra feature on it and was cheaper on Amazon than it was in the store. However, when it came, there was a giant sticker over the back of the box, replicating the original box, except no longer listing the remembrance feature. You can even still see the old box, where it is listed, underneath. Why this was done, I don't know, but it makes for an extremely disappointing purchase.",1448323200,2,631,4.543859649122807

38084,5,0782010792,"There are over 2 thousand reviews on Amazon for this movie with the majority giving it 5 stars.
There is a reason for the rating, obviously. This is a timeless film that captures the idea of family
and its importance in the community. It is not about politics or religion. It's about how any family
member has influence on each of its members and the community as a whole. It takes a family
and a village, to paraphrase.

Intellectualizing aside this emotional film moves me like no other. It says as an individual we are
relied upon for the some of the biggest issues and the smallest issues in other lives. It shows us
how one person can make a difference in one person's life or many lives. Simply by being we
change the time line of our world in a emotional and human way. It is a charming and sweet view
of difficult times and how those individuals cope or might have coped if one person was never
alive to connect.

I feel that emotionally the film gets it right as the main character moves from frustration to despair
as local events close in on and bear down on him. Little things in his life, (the loose finial ball on
top of the stair case post.) irritate him so easily. This is noticed by his family and wife as a seem-
ingly easy going, happy-go-lucky guy who has everything in the world, takes a downward spiral.
There is only one option, he thinks, that will help his family and his community.

The actual historical time line in the film is a bit skewed but most films always play fast and loose
with facts to simply get across an emotional idea. That's okay because if you are watching this film
and noticing that historical facts are not in line then you are not experiencing the film. Just sit back
and enjoy it for gosh sake. It was made as entertainment and to present an emotional idea about
the individual and community.

Interestingly this film did not do well when it was released on December 25, 1946. Like some films
they need to age a bit before an audience is found and a cult status emerges. It got mixed reviews,
5 Oscar nominations, won none and was a box office receipt failure. Of the 400 plus films released
that year it came in number 26. It was not until the 70's and 80's, with repeated holiday viewings
during those 2 decades, that helped create this film as an ""instant classic"".

If you do not have this on any media, get it. It is worth watching this film any time of the year. But
with the coming holiday it is a must see for the entire family. So cozy up, pop the popcorn, pour the
eggnog, a big blanket with the family and prepare to be entertained and elated beyond belief.",1446422400,,2618,4.34560327198364

38143,5,0782010792,"An absolute classic. Jimmy Stewart turned in the zenith performance of his career with this 1947 film classic. Joined by the other cast members and the directorial touch of Frank Capra, a remarkable piece of film was given to the American viewers to be enjoyed time and time again. Often written off as a Christmas film or schmaltz, It's a Wonderful Life is neither. George Bailey is a complex character. He is first and foremost a man, and he feels the acute pain of bitter disappointment. He doesn't act out of love for his fellow man, he acts out of love and respect for his family. He is burdened with being the eldest son, and the responsibility that that entails, and his greatest desire, to travel, is thwarted by these responsibilities. We share his pain because George Bailey is a good man and we want to see good things happen to him. While his brother and his friends achieve fame and fortune, George is left behind in Bedford Falls, the town he grew up in and so desperately wants to escape. George is resentful of the people who put him in this situation, especially the unscrupulous Mr Potter, played by the excellent Lionel Barrymore. When $3000 goes missing from the Building and Loans, George is at the end of his tether, and Clarence the angel is sent to save him.

This really is not schmaltz or saccharine, the film is a dark study of responsibility and disappointment, and even though all ends happily around the Christmas tree, this certainly is not a Christmas movie, because by definition they have to be crap.",1438128000,,1534,4.639705882352941
38144,5,0782010792,"This is probably my favorite all-time movie. It has become a Christmas tradition in our family.

38216,5,0782010792,"OK, raise your hand if you think Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is mushy, sentimental, over-praised hokum.  Now, go to your room.  Both of you.  It's surprising, though, that while today we think of the film as an American institution, it did not fare well in its first theatrical release.  In fact, it lost over half a million dollars, a fair sum in 1947.  It was really television that elevated the picture to its present popularity, especially as a perennial Christmas favorite.  It is none too soon to have it on a high-definition Blu-ray disc.

The familiar plot, based on Philip Van Doren Stern's short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" covers some forty years in the life of a good, honest man, George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart in a role he was born to play.  But even good, honest people get down and depressed sometimes, and this happens when George faces financial ruin through the carelessness of his Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) and the dishonesty of the town skinflint, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).  Neither the love of his children nor the devotion of his wife (Donna Reed) can divert George from what he thinks is his only way out:  suicide.  He figures he's worth more dead than alive if his family can get his life insurance.  But a guardian angel named Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) saves him.  Clarence allows George to see how much his life is really worth by showing him what the world would have been like without him, had he never been born.

It's a sweet fable, told mainly in flashback as we watch George grow up, have aspirations to do great and adventurous things, be forced by circumstances to stay in his small hometown of Bedford Falls, marry, live happily, and then face possible disaster; which is where Clarence steps in to take us to the present.

The movie's themes are obvious:  Our lives touch many more people than we realize.  Until Clarence points this out to him, George never knows how much good he has done in the world, how many people he has made happy just by being a nice fellow.  Further, the movie leads us to see that no one is a failure who believes in himself.  This was Capra's own creed.  ""No man is a failure,"" he said.  George just needs someone to restore his confidence.

My own interpretation, though, is closer to what Thornton Wilder was driving at in the similarly inspired story, ""Our Town.""  In that famous American play, Wilder suggests that life's real joys are in the simple things, the everyday, mundane pleasures of friends and family and daily existence, a lesson learned by a recently deceased young woman allowed to relive a day in her past.  Indeed, it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Wilder's earlier piece directly inspired Frank Capra, the director, producer, and co-writer of ""It's A Wonderful Life.""

Capra's populist appeal in the story took a while to catch on, as I've said, with the film growing in popularity over the years.  As common, everyday working people began to understand for themselves the importance of the individual, they may have begun also to appreciate Capra's ideas about everyone sharing in the American Dream.  Perhaps the greed principle has somewhat tarnished this Dream in recent years, but it hasn't diminished the importance of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" one bit, a film that is just as important today as it was in 1947, in 1957, or in 1977.  Come to think of it, it's probably more important now than ever.

Trivia notes, courtesy of John Eastman, ""Retakes,"" Ballantine Books, 1989:  ""At loose ends with his career stalled just after his World War II army discharge, James Stewart gratefully accepted Frank Capra's offer of the role of George Bailey, a part in the long-shelved script that RKO had originally bought for Cary Grant.  Jean Arthur spurned the costarring role that went to Donna Reed.  Lionel Barrymore, reveling in skinflint characters, accepted his part without reading the script.  The town of Bedford Falls, including tons of chemical snow, shaved ice, and gypsum to simulate snow, arose on the RKO Ranch.""

Video:
Paramount give us two versions of the film:  the original black-and-white and a newer colorized rendering, using a pair of dual-layer BD50s and an MPEG-4 audio-video codec.  They also preserve the film's original aspect ratio, about 1.33:1, typical of movies made before CinemaScope and other widescreen processes of the 1950s.  I'm not sure why the studio felt the need to provide the colorized version, although in high def it does look sharp and clear.  Unfortunately, the colors don't look very realistic, having the dull, deaden appearance of most films artificially colorized.

The black-and-white reproduction, though, is a different story altogether, among the most stunning such transfers imaginable, with some of the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and most gleaming contrasts one could ask for.  Paramount claim in their press release that they fully restored the film.  I shouldn't doubt it.  Just compare the results with the standard-definition making-of featurette that accompanies the film.  It's practically night and day.  The new high-def picture quality on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is as good as or better than any B&W transfer I've seen.

Audio:
Unfortunately, after all the fine work Paramount did restoring and remastering the picture, they chose to use ordinary, lossy Dolby Digital for the sound.  It's monaural sound, to be sure, with a limited frequency response and dynamic range, so maybe they thought it didn't matter.  In any case, the sound is clean and smooth, with virtually no background noise, so, who knows--maybe it doesn't matter after all.

Extras:
I suppose Paramount figured that providing the two versions of the movie was enough.  I dunno.  In addition, they do give us a brief featurette, ""The Making of It's A Wonderful Life,"" about twenty-three minutes long, in standard definition.  Actor Tom Bosley hosts this segment, released in 1990 and looking the worse for wear.  It includes interviews with surviving actors from the film, like the late Jimmy Stewart, Sheldon Leonard, and Capra himself, all of whom reveal a wealth of minutia and behind-the-scenes trivia.  Oddly missing from the set, however--given the two double-layer Blu-ray discs involved--is the featurette ""A Personal Remembrance,"" which the studio include in their regular DVD sets.  With so important and well loved a film, they might have included more bonuses.  Oh, well....

The extras conclude with an original theatrical trailer in high def; twenty-eight scene selections; bookmarks; pop-up menus; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  A nicely embossed, cardboard slipcover ties the package together.

Parting Thoughts:
I understand the concern some people may have about buying a high-definition edition of an old black-and-white film.  I can say without hesitation, I'd do it.  The Blu-ray image is so crisp and clear it serves as much as the story itself to bring tears of joy to your eyes.  Of course, if you don't already own the film and you have a Blu-ray player, the disc is a must-buy in any case.  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is one of the handful of American classics that anyone with a claim to building a home video library has to own.

""Dear George:
Remember no man is a failure who has friends.
Thanks for the wings.

Love,

Clarence""",1433635200,,7428,4.9869918699186995

I actually was watching a Christmas movie on the Hallmark channel where it was tradition for the mother and daughter to watch this movie every year together. My tradition with my daughters when they were home was to watch Miracle on 34th Street. Since that time, I have been remarried... Well, my second husband has been kind of a scrooge and never seemed excited about the holidays so, it kind of brought me down. I would decorate by myself and everything. The past few years, I didn't even bother putting up a tree. I left my husband a year ago and this past season was the best Christmas I have had in a very long time!

38855,5,0782010792,"Five and one-half stars. There are already many reviews and synopses of the plot, so I won't repeat that information here. But please keep in mind that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is not just a Christmas movie, it is a movie about life. And good things do come to good people.

Let me highlight a couple of fun facts and production notes about the movie:

(a)  When it was first released, the movie received mixed reviews from the critics and the viewers, many who were concerned that Potter got away with the $8,000 and never got his due. Later, when the movie became public domain and gained considerable popularity from repeated airings during the 1970's, there was a groundswell of new interest and appreciation of the movie. It has now benefited from various DVD releases, and you can watch it at your pleasure. Nothing like the Capra-esque spirit within us all.

(b) In the scene when the half-looped Uncle Billy walks off-camera to ""exit stage left"" after leaving Harry Bailey's wedding reception, a grip knocked over a light fixture causing the ""crash"" that you hear in the movie sounding like garbage cans being knocked over. Thomas Mitchell (playing Uncle Billy) saved the scene by ad-libbing ""I'm alright, I'm alright!"" as if he had fallen over the garbage cans in his drunken gait.

(c) In the scene with George and Mary on the same phone talking with Sam Wainright when they ultimately succumb to their love for each other, James Stewart (George) and Donna Reed (Mary) apparently forgot a whole page of dialog from the script, but Frank Capra left the cut as is because they captured the emotion so perfectly on that take.

Amazon reviewer guidelines expressly discourage, perhaps prohibit, referencing other reviews in your own. That is why they allow commenting on reviews; you can write your comments underneath that review itself.

However, I would like to borrow and discuss ideas from two other reviews here so that I can clearly express my thoughts about them in my own review. So, my apologies in advance to the Amazon review editors.

Let me first discuss my disputation, call it the ""bad news."" One reviewer describes Potter as the ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" of Bedford Falls. I vehemently disagree with this analogy and would like to dispel that notion once and for all.

In ""A Christmas Carol,"" Ebenezer Scrooge is transformed, reborn, after the visitation by the three Christmas spirits, after which (quoting the British 1951 version) ""...he became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old city every knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world. And it was always said that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.""

In ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Henry F. Potter is downright evil, through and through, with a frequent flyer miles seat reserved for him down below. He is crippled by (literally) and fixated upon his power and control over the working class folks of Bedford Falls. Potter is evil at the beginning of the movie, the middle, and the end, spanning nearly two generations just in the movie itself and never wavering from his villainous ways to the bitter end, having gotten away with stealing the Baileys' $8,000. Unlike Scrooge, Potter never changes. To compare him to Scrooge would be to insult Charles Dickens.

Now, my affirmation, the ""good news,"" centers upon the idea another reviewer expressed. Peter Bailey (George's dad) and Uncle Billy founded Bailey Bros. Savings & Loan Assoc. for the express purpose of allowing common working folks to afford the American dream of owning their own home. The timeline of the movie courses through the pre-war and post-war depressions of two world wars and the great depression of the 1930's, and the Bailey's kept that ""one-horse"" financial institution going through thick and thin for the benefit of its members.

George continues the legacy of his dad and uncle sacrificing his own ambitions and wanderlust to keep the business and the idea of the American dream going. Whether he realized it or not (he did at the end), in his sacrifice so that others could realize ""the dream,"" he himself was also realizing the dream with his wife, Mary, and his four children residing in the old Granville house at 320 Sycamore Street.

So join me and Harry Bailey (George's younger brother) in raising our glasses ""to [Harry's] brother, the richest man in town."" At the end, Clarence Oddbody (George's guardian angel) said it best, ""Remember that no man is a failure who has friends.""",1419897600,,4540,4.835051546391752

It's a Wonderful Life is one of those films (like Gone With the Wind, Casablanca and Citizen Kane) where so much has already been said about it you wonder if it's possible to think of something new to add to the table so I won't rehash the plot.

Instead, I would like to ask a question. Supposing Clarence had given George eight thousand dollars or exposed Henry Potter's theft instead of showing him what the world would be like without him. Would that really have solved everything?

 I think George's despair and contemplation of suicide went a lot deeper than the possibility of going to prison for his senile uncle's carelessness. At the beginning, you can tell he is a very ambitious but insecure young man. He wants to get out of his lower class and his sleepy little Norman Rockwell town, away from the building and loan he hates so much and make a name for himself--possibly as a building designer, which he considers a more sophisticated profession. Remember the ""I know what I'm going to do the next day, the next day and the one after that"" speech where he tells Mary all the things he wants to do. But sadly, his dreams are stifled over and over. When he's about to dash out the door of the building and loan, one of the staff members tells him if he doesn't stay behind and take the Chairman seat left by his deceased father, the committee will vote for the greedy, power hungry Mr. Potter to fill the vacancy. So he stays behind and sacrifices his hard earned money for college. In the telephone scene between him and Mary he lets her know he doesn't want any ground floors or plastics; he wants to be his own man. But his love for her prevails over his personal wishes. Once again, on their way home from the wedding, there is a run on the building and loan and they have to sacrifice their hard earned money for their honeymoon to keep the business from shutting down and Mr. Potter from taking it. His younger brother gets more publicity for his heroics overseas--something George could never do because he has only one ear that works. On top of that he is jealous of his friend Sam Wainwright because he drives around in a flashy car and showers his wife with silks, jewels and furs he could never give Mary. And for the last straw, his uncle misplaces eight thousand dollars and the `sacrifice/deny yourself for the sake of the greater good' mentality is so deeply ingrained in George's head that he's willingly to say HE misplaced it and go to jail in his place--whether he likes his uncle or not.

If you pay close attention to famous scene where George comes home and takes his frustrations out on his family at Christmas Eve he knocks over a model bridge and a couple of towers--things HE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF BUILIDNG--a powerful, chilling representation of how his aspirations are crashing down for good.

There's a virtue to lowering your expectations and making due with the little bit you have but some people simply have a hard time with practicality and ordinary life and an overly sensitive, imaginative and melodramatic man like George would find it extremely difficult to grasp this concept--even his nemesis Mr. Potter admits he is no ordinary yokel. ""Here is a bright, intelligent, ambitious young man who hates his town, hates the building and loan and has been itching to break free from the day he was born.""

George is relentlessly hindered from pursuing the things he loves and feels like he is quietly going insane over it, little by little.

What I love best about the film is that the angel doesn't come to make things perfect. He's just there to remind George of all the good he has done for his family and friends, that there will always be injustice in the world, that it can be used as an impetus to the improvement of his character if he chooses and therefore to throw it all away simply due to his bad circumstances would be a great sin. Rather than merely bail him out of his earthly problems, he has done something much better for him--he has encouraged him to adopt a new outlook on life. Now, George no longer cares about his pursuits, no longer hates the building and loan and even wishes Mr. Potter a Merry Christmas!

The townsfolk pitching in to pay the debt is a little unrealistic considering this movie is set during the end of World War Two when in real life they would be pinching pennies while the fathers and sons come back looking for new jobs but even if the film had ended with George being carried off to jail by the crime commissioners after hugging and kissing his wife and children goodbye the film would still have resonated just as powerfully and dramatically because George's REAL problems (spiritual) have been solved.

I wish James Stewart had won the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor of 1946 instead of Frederic March for The Best Years of Our Lives because he got to play a more complex character. We see his insecurities developing layer upon layer as he sacrifices over and over for the `greater good' until the aforementioned Christmas Eve scene. What I love best about his portrayal is that he never makes George look like a cardboard cutout hero. He is loud, bad tempered, strong willed and determined to do what he wants. Probably his best moment is on the bridge where he begs Clarence and then God to get him out of the vision--truly the biggest emotional punch. And his scenes with Donna Reed (like when he teases her with her bathrobe and gives her the cold shoulder when she invites him to her house) are crackling with humor and wit--their ""Aaaaand dance by the light of the..."" ""What?...Oh, oh, yeah. THAT."" Alone is award worthy.

The rest of the cast add some nice shading and color and even though they are stock characters they all seem to have their own distinct personality; eccentric Mr. Gower, grouchy, cantankerous Mr. Potter, vain coquettish Violet, sweet, kind Mrs. Bailey, opinionated, loud mouthed Annie, mischievous, flirtatious Harry, how can one forget them?",1418515200,3,6357,4.727436823104693

If you'd like a more modern/current version, I'd recommend The Family Man with Nicolas Cage and Tia Leone.  A young Jimmy Stewart plays a young father with a gaggle of kids and a wife... he gets to find out what the world would be like without him....and it changes his life, for the better. If only we could all get that chance!  In any case, it's a holiday classic.  If you haven't seen it before, try it.  Good for the entire family in my opinion.",1418428800,3,567,4.352380952380952

This is perhaps the greatest Christmas movie of all time.  There are a few, very few, other contenders, Miracle on 34th Street heading the list.  Its a Wonderful Life was released in 1946, Miracle on 34th Street in the following year.
 Like the Bible, the movie begins with the word.  In the movie, the word is a conversation among the staff in heaven, neatly depicted as talking stars.  A novice Angel is dispatched to Earth to save a severely depressed and ruined Jimmy Stewart from an untimely and un-necessary suicide.  The novice reviews Stewarts life prior to his departure for Earth, so we get to know George Bailey (Stewart) from childhood to middle age.  It turns out that George Bailey is a good guy with the great American virtues of honesty, courage, decency, tenacity, self sacrifice, fidelity and ceaseless striving to be a better man.  Wow, we just don't see that kind of thing much any more in the flickers.
 The beloved by Americans Donna Reed plays his wife.  Lionel Barrymore is the evil local rich guy, who will stoop to any scurrilous deed to become even richer.  Ward Bond is among many familiar faces in the supporting cast.  Having these great actors helps what might have been a ho-hum sentimental journey become a truly memorable motion picture.
 This hour and a half movie is the child of the great Frank Capra.  Capra has a credit for the screenplay.  He also produced this magnificent film.  He also directed it.  Thats a triple play when it works, and it does here, none better.
 I picked up a couple of oddities that I would like to share with you.  The evil rich man is named Harry Potter.  The cab driver and the policeman are nearly always shown together.  Their names are Bert and Ernie.
 I know that this is shown every year on TV, as it should be.  It is such a fine piece of work that you should see it without commercial interruption.  It is worth paying close attention to this one.",1416873600,,1944,4.565217391304348

Despite its ubiquitous presence every holiday season and the years where it seemed like every TV station on the planet had a print of the film, It's a Wonderful Life has never lost a shred of its power. I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen it, but watching it again last night, I had tears streaming down my face.

39393,5,0782010792,"The center of the film is Jimmy Stewart's remarkable portrayal of George Bailey - he allows us to admire his courage and persistence, to sympathize with his frustration, and rejoice in his redemption. Given the number of reviews here, I feel no need to delve further into the film's plot or execution. I would like to point out a few irrelevant issues concerning the Clarence Oddbody character:

Angels are not dead people; they are an entirely separate race of beings. This was taken for granted for thousands of years. Suddenly, in early 20th Century America, ""angels"" became the souls of the departed in Heaven, wearing white robes, floating through the clouds playing harps, with golden rings floating horizontally above their heads. The ""halo"" is supposed to be the visible aura of highly spiritually developed persons, typically most easily seen around the head as it would have been concentrated there, as well as being positioned at eye level. The halo is found in many religious traditions. Attempts to depict it in sculpture resulted in its morphing into a disk or ring behind or above the subject's head. Fortunately, Clarence is supposed to pass for a living human in the film, so he lacks this ridiculous ornament. The phrase ""every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings"" is a bit of authentic-sounding folklore unique to this movie.

Clock and watchmaking around the time of Clarence's life and death (supposedly the 18th Century) was most highly developed in England. Later, American companies such as Hamilton, Bulova, Gruen, and others produced the finest watches in the world through the middle of the 20th Century. Surprisingly, Swiss watches were not considered high quality until comparatively recently - even in the 1960s, Hamilton was putting out a budget line of watches with Swiss inner workings, similar to a modern maker using Chinese mechanisms. The rise of the Swiss watch industry is sheer marketing brilliance virtually unequaled by any other product. In any event, clock and watchmaking in Clarence's time would have required knowledge of mathematics and precision engineering, an unlikely field for a sweet but somewhat slow fellow like Clarence (""He's got the mind of a rabbit"").

But these are minor quibbles, and hardly detract from the overall excellence and enjoyment of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""",1402704000,,2338,5.115183246073299

We have had the LaserDisc version of the movie for many years but decided to go ahead and buy this Blu-ray version as it seemed to offer many extra opportunities to enjoy the movie as both a story and an example of good movie making.

This version is definitely a must have for those who have loved the story and enjoyed it at least once each year at Christmas.

It is truly is a masterpiece film directed by the very talented Frank Capra. The acting and characterization in this film is is superb.  There are elements of romance, love, friendships, sentimentality, comedy, adventure, sorrow, and seriousness.  The film shows the importance and seriousness of life.  The character, George Bailey, states that he wishes he was never born and the Guardian Angel, Clarence, shows him how other people's lives would've been so different if he was never born.  As the movie points out, each man's life touches so many other lives.  When Clarence the Angel gets his wings, he sends a thank you note to George Bailey thanking him for the wings and telling him  to remember that no man is a failure who friends.  This is a very powerful movie that will affect people emotionally and seriously.  We all should be very thankful for being alive and to count the blessing that we have.

I also watched the colorized version.  Colorization has come a long way - I used to hate the early attempts.  The color version was pleasant but did seem to appear a bit more grainy.  Whites still aren't white (teeth have a grayish tint), and overall still looks like a medium quality color movie (whereas the B&W version looks very high quality).  The color version isn't obnoxious and I liked it.

And of course the story.  Still wonderful after all these years.  I won't attempt to repeat a review of the movie itself as it has been done many times before.  A heartwarming and fun movie that helps answer the question: what are we missing in life? - we probably have everything we need if only we stopped to reflect.",1389139200,,861,4.490322580645161

up to Christmas.  This past year, however, the movie was not aired until just before Christmas.
I think it maybe because NBC bought the TV rights to the movie???

When we sympathize with George Bailey and the ramshackle Bailey Building and Loan Association and despise the alternative vision of Potterville we implicitly criticize an economic model of maximizing the efficiency of capital allocation and of replacing small town human values with the anonymity of the market. If our tears are genuine and if our satisfaction about the harmonious ending of the film has any meaning - what are we doing about it? Do we prefer cooperative banking over large bank efficiency? Do we try to find ways of supporting the economically weak neighbor in finding housing? Do we emulate George Bailey as a role model in forsaking college and honeymoon to support the community?

SYNOPSIS--
After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.

Since I have deleted the critical review I posted this evening on this DVD as NBC was playing this epic classic, this new comment is moot; but I was complaining (then) about the HD format being stretched from the native 1.33:1 to 1.85:1, and criticized Paramount for doing this. That was inaccurate. The problem was mine, not the DVD. The aspect ratio is true to the original format. Unfortunately, a new Sony Blue-ray player and a new monitor I was setting up was the problem. Sorry for any readers that may have seen this before I corrected my mistake.
The comments about the crystal clairty of this recording is accurate. Far better than the original film version, which is why we buy these DVDs in the first place. No home should be without this holiday classic; and please watch in the original ""square"" format, even though it is easy to want to stretch it for our HD TVs.

Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his ""fellow travelers.""

SYNOPSIS--
After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.

It shows the value of hard work and thrift, but also exposes the evil that ensues in the absence of life guided by a strong moral compass. George Bailey vs Old man Potter, good verses evil. George and people like him make it possible to have a Bedford Falls where people are basically good, hard working, prosperous, and compassionate.

40256,5,0782010792,"This classic American tale of George Bailey, a selfless and compassionate young man who yearns for travel and adventure but never escapes from the small town where he has grown up, is easily one of the most beloved movies ever made. The great James Stewart plays George Bailey, and I can't think of a better performance by him. He is Everyman embodied -- basically good and decent but also humanly flawed. Even when he finds love in Mary Hatch (Donna Reed, near the beginning of her career but at her very best), George's fundamental unhappiness, which has seethed beneath the surface for most of his life, continues, only to boil over during a crisis to the point where George considers suicide. That's when Providence intervenes -- literally, in the form of Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers, in a perfect performance) an ""Angel, 2nd Class"" who has arrived from Heaven to present George with a most unusual gift: the opportunity to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.

I choose to reveal no more. You will have to discover the rest for yourself. Know, however, that this is as good as moviemaking gets. It is Frank Capra directing at the zenith of his powers. It digs very deeply into the human psyche with a vision as affectionate and positive as anything ever portrayed on the screen. And if you do not find yourself weeping unashamedly at the finale -- because, as someone once said, no tears are more intense than those of longing fulfilled -- then you might want to examine your susceptibility to emotion.

Stewart and Reed are joined by a superb supporting cast, including Samuel S. Hinds as Bailey's salt-of-the-earth father, Thomas Mitchell as his eccentric uncle Billy, Beulah Bondi as his mother, Ward Bond as Bert the cop, Frank Faylen as Ernie the taxi driver, Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower the druggist, and a young Sheldon Leonard (who became a major TV producer in the 1950s and '60s) as Nick the bartender. There's also Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, ""the meanest man in town"" and George's frequent foe and tormentor. As for the minor characters, you'll understand how vividly Capra has painted them during one shot at the very end, where he pans the camera across a large grouping, and you recognize everyone.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1382054400,,2538,5.202933985330073

ASC(Angel Second Class), Clarence Oddbody needs to get his wings. George Bailey is desperately in need of an Angel. So the powers up above arrange a meeting. It's a story made in heaven.

Clarence gets to view George Bailey's life from the time he was a young boy until the present, when George is having so many problems he thinks he would be better off if he'd never been born (it may be safe to say we have all had days like that!). We watch as George touches the lives of so many from boyhood to adulthood. He saves his brother's life,he stops his boss(a druggist) from making a fatal mistake, he saves the family business, ""The Building and Loan Assoc,"" from the hands of the Scrooge-like Mr. Potter; is friend and mentor to so many, and although never gets to follow his dreams of travel, settles down with the girl next door in his town, Bedford Falls.

But things start going amiss for poor George; an accidental misplacement of a large sum of money and the auditor showing up just at the wrong time, causes George to face loosing everything he THINKS is important. He's on the bridge, ready to pack it all in when his guardian angel Clarence shows up in the nick of time. Clarence shows George what life would REALLY be like if he was never born. It's not good! George must realize that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" before he can exist again.

Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey. He is just tremendous in this role. We see the full range of his talents as he runs the course of going from carefree, to distraught, to bitter and finally elated with life as he discovers Zuzu's petals have reappeared in his pocket. The petals that disappeared from his pocket when he disappeared from existence. Henry Travers is Clarence and there has never been a more cherubic angel than he. Donna Reed as Mary(George's wife) is exceptional at making a wonderful life for George and looking great doing it. And Lionel Barrymore is the mean Mr. Potter who we love to hate. There are so many other famous faces to look for that do such a superb job, here are a few...the great character actor Thomas Mitchell is the forgetful ""Uncle Billy"", Lillian Randolph is ""Annie"", the housekeeper, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey, Ellen Corby, the lady who only wants $17.50, Gloria Grahame is Violet and don't miss Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, mischievous as ever at the pool scene.

So it's clear as a bell(oh..I think an Angel just got his wings!)if you're feeling a little down, watch this movie and like Zuzu's petals, your smile will reappear.

The set I bought contains the black and white version, and the colorized version.  Even though I am a purist, I was curious about the colorized version.  I could not watch five minutes of it!

40364,5,0782010792,"This is not only a Christmas classic but a classic in any sense of the word. It is the best of Stewart and Capra adding up to one of the most heartwarming stories of all time.  This may exhibit Stewart is his every man role once again but it breaks away from Mr. Smith in many ways making it another uniquely great film. A film like this that makes you know and feel for characters is certainly worth watching. Starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed with a fantastic supporting cast,  the film tells the life story of George Bailey. We watch with the angel Clarence as he sees George's life unfold. George saves his brother Harry as a boy and as a result loses hearing in his ear. He plans to travel and go to college but once more he sacrifices. He builds up all those around him with selfless kindness while also standing up to the grumpy millionaire Mr. Potter. Eventually he marries the love of his life and has children. Although by unfortunate circumstances Bailey finds himself contemplating suicide. That's when Clarence comes into his life to show George just how important he really is. Once he gets his life back George finds immediate joy and gains so much because of his friends and family. There is nothing much to do after this film but simply be happy. It is a Wonderful film in many ways, with a wonderful cast, and a wonderful message.",1370044800,,1352,4.491869918699187

40489,2,0782010792,"Detail-wise and depth-of-image-wise, this Blu-Ray improves on the Silver Anniversary Edition DVD that I previously owned (and which I gave to my sister after acquiring the BD). I wasn't happy about losing the extra feature on Frank Capra that was on the DVD, but life is short.

This BD generally cleans up the picture we've all seen over the years into a steadier and more-detailed version. However, there are MAJOR problems with the transfer: DNR has been over-employed which adds a glassy look to certain scenes. There's a really bad vertical scratch mark running along the right edge of the film that starts when the now-repentant George Bailey returns to the bridge to pray for help. That scratch runs pretty much through the final 9 minutes of the film, and it's impossible to ignore as one tries to watch the movie as the scratch flickers and changes position. I don't remember that scratch in previous issues, so it's REALLY disappointing to see it on the BD. It's also disappointing to read so many 5-star reviews of this BD, none of which mention these glaring and obvious faults. One wonders if the reviewers even bothered to watch the BD before reviewing.

As others have noted, this package includes both the original B&W and the colorized versions of the film. The scratch I mentioned is very visible in the colorized version as well, though the digital manipulation is less stark in the colorized version than the original B&W.

I suppose this is the BD version we're stuck with until someone at Paramount decides to spruce up the film correctly...which is to say, fix the damn picture! To date, Paramount's efforts have been restricted to gussying up the packaging: first, in 2009, with the BD case wrapped in a sparkling O-ring, and then again in 2011, when they threw in an ornament and some other useless crap in a ""Gift Box"" edition. Both versions include the problematic 2009 mastering discussed herein.

You can't tell a book by it's cover, nor - apparently - the transfer of a well-known and -beloved film from the outside packaging.

Disappointing, to say the least.",1363737600,7,2090,4.8431372549019605

It's a classic black and white movie with actors and a director from a classic age. It's a great old-fashioned homespun yarn, full of warm apple-pie humour, with a clever but simple dramatic twist that reflects eternal values. It's a tragi-comedy told in a small town setting, but which takes on all the gravitas of an epic moral tale with a profound spiritual truth. It's guaranteed to produce tears, as the value of a life - and life - is beautifully celebrated in an unexpected way.

I still tear up when George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) realizes his life positively touched so many of his fellow human beings.

The Bailey's may have failed as successful capitalists compared to the curmudgeon Henry Potter but you cannot deny the compassion in their hearts. It's a great Christmas film.",1359936000,,470,4.949367088607595

I think NBC holds exclusive rights to the movie and therefore only airs it a couple times a year at it's own discretion.  Even more reason to own a copy.  This version includes classic B&W version as well as a color disc. To be honest, my family and I initially agreed that it's borderline blasphemy to watch the color version over the original ... however, we were all also curious enough as to what the color version looks like that I'm sure we'll watch it eventually.

While I love the b&w seeing it in color made it so that you noticed things that didn't show up in the b&w version. Especially people's faces that were slightly behind the person in front. It made many of the other characters shine more and thereby deepened the film.

Both disks are great! I don't know what anyone was talking about with ""pops"" in the audio. I heard no such thing.

We did watch the black&white one first and didn't think we'd appreciate an altered (color) version. We were wrong. It was so realistic that we forgot we were watching an altered copy! Yet, I will probably still want to see it in B&W more often than not simply due to the fact that it is the ""original"".

I think he can relate to it and I think that's true for alot of people who love this movie. It has just grown on me over the years so I purchased it and I played it on Christmas Day for the family while we celebrated Christmas together.

40721,5,0782010792,"It's A Wonderful Life (1946), originally made for Liberty Films, is one of the most popular and heartwarming films ever made by director Frank Capra. Frank Capra regarded this film as his own personal favorite - it was also James Stewart's favorite of all his feature films.

It was actually a box-office flop at the time of its release, and only became the Christmas movie classic in the 1970s due to repeated television showings at Christmas-time when its copyright protection slipped and it fell into the public domain in 1974 and TV stations could air it for free.

There really are no decent ones, even, least of all classics. Even the 90s adaptation of 'Miracle on 34th Street"" was just a poor copy of the original (which is not even an astounding film, in itself!)  My wife and I both like two James Stewart Christmas films - this one and ""The Shop Around the Corner"" - and the 1994 version of ""Little Women"". Outside of that, she really likes the TV debut of the Waltons entitled ""The Homecoming"" and I have fond memories of the Rankin/Bass TV specials.

I would give the color restoration an 'A' rating. Based on the color version, I would assume that the black and white version in its format would also be of good quality.

This has both B&W and color versions, and the colorized is impressive in how good it looks.  The B&W version is also great looking.

The extras are nice, but the main reason to get this is the quality of the movie.

40987,3,0782010792,"I just watched It's A Wonderful Life again the other night and it was comforting to find that time and life can mold one's opinion. I've always liked this movie but it was generally enjoyed in the sentimental run-up to Christmas and tossed in with the rest of the holiday fare. Therefore, it was always judged as a simple feel-good holiday movie and nothing more. After last night's viewing, I found myself with a lot more questions than answers and a lot more criticism than optimism.

For starters, given today's political landscape, I find such a movie a bit confusing. Why isn't Potter hailed as a job creator and Bailey Loan a victim of the invisible hand of the free market? Isn't George's method of running his bank closer to socialism than pure capitalism? Most troubling, what is the message? Is it that staying in a stifling dead-end small town and a soul-crushing job are offset by the presence of friends and family? Is it saying that one has to choose between the two?

It isn't hard to empathize with George's simmering rage because he is beaten down so much by the misery of Bedford Falls that he ends up a whipped dog who settles on suicide rather than facing another day of his life. What brings him back is an angel who reminds him that two people would've had dramatically different life outcomes if he hadn't been born. Both key events occurred when he was young, so surely he could've left town and let Bedford Falls take care of itself while he pursued his dreams. Why is that the only choice - non-existence or never leaving Bedford Falls? Could he not have been the one to save the soldiers?  Could he not have returned after his travels to rescue Mary from the library and raise his brood? It's all so frustratingly fatalistic.

In the end, I think this movie is mismatched as a Christmas movie. The only part that takes place around the holiday is the final scenes and the larger point isn't contingent upon the holidays. IAWL is a sweet but ultimately muddled message of a movie and it is a far cry from the other Christmas Capra, the powerful and life-affirming Meet John Doe.  Merry Christmas, Potterville. 3.5 stars.",1356480000,,2146,4.607329842931938

This is the best colorized version I have ever seen.  Normally the mouth is not colorized or what is already shown as black or white are not coloriozed and detract from the movie, because all that I would notice is what was not coloriozed or coloriozed poorly.  This is an excellent colorization and it uses colors that fit the time era as well. Love the movie and love it more now that it is in color.  Highly recommend this movie at Christmas time or any other time too. It is an AWESOME movie!!!  Everytime a bell rings!!!",1356480000,,667,4.261904761904762

41022,5,0782010792,"This is without a doubt,one of THE BEST movies ever made. It has such a great moral message to it. It's really a shame that most of the movies that come out today,don't have that same morality that this great film has. The story is very inspriational and touching. Whenever life gets you down or you get depressed about something,just pop in this dvd,and it will remind you...that this is a WONDERFUL LIFE.Merry Christmas everybody.",1356393600,,432,4.773333333333333
41023,5,0782010792,Our family watches this movie every year.  The old VHS finally gave out so I found this DVD set.  The colorized version was a nice change.,1356307200,,138,4.269230769230769
41024,5,0782010792,"How could this film get anything less than five stars? Just a complete classic in every way. Jimmy Stewart is amazing in this role as George Bailey, and should probably patent the phrase, ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!!""  where else would something catchy, touching and all around fun come from?  It's the tagline and sum of the whole movie, to show that you find what is important in your life and try and not to worry about the things you cannot change, and family is really the most important at the end of the day!

  So in line with the movie... what if THIS MOVIE had never been made ??  Wow, what movie would be everyones favorite around the December time of year. Always so great its one of those staples they show, more than once around the end of December, and it never gets old watching it, ever.  The last few minutes are always my favorite.  But if it had not been made, sure there are some other nice classics out there, but this is one that is on the books for Stewart to show what a great actor he truly was.  We would not have our favorite taglines to use if this movie had never been made and would not have a film of this sort to really show us how each of us should really value who we are, and know the slightest act of kindness or even just our presence could totally affect someome else, its all in the stream of life, so value and cherish and be the best we can be, and be so happy we have a classic film like this to enjoy for years. so glad its on DVD !!

  The movies of 2000 + and beyond, and really years before that seem to be lacking in movies that will be true Classics like the Black and White Films, films that have just amazing beautiful, classic, actors.  The movies current now are filled with so much violence, bad language and just silly, mindless scripts, just you have to even monitor with your children before they can watch them, to me, it seems impossible in 60 years that hardly any of these will be categorized as Classic and Meaningful.

  The Sound of Music is on TV right now, yet another classic annual movie they show on Television, which I love !!  Lets keep the Film industry knowing we want true classics to be made, because there is a great number of us out there who want to watch them, and enjoy and treasure them, now and for years to come.  The Audrey's, the Grace Kelly's, Jimmy Stewart, all of those out there, we value and respect your work as actors !",1356220800,,2413,4.2428884026258205
41025,5,0782010792,It is nice to own a copy of this classic movie without being forced to watch it in black & white.  The colored version is very vivid and helps to bring out a lot of detail that is missed in the original version.,1356220800,,211,3.9069767441860463
41026,5,0782010792,"The movie's story is about service to others in a world where people are commonly tempted or bullied into passivity.  George Bailey though is unafraid, curious, an activist, and is drawn to see and get involved with everything in the wide world.  It's just that no one can replace his services in Bedford Falls, and he feels his duty is there.  The story builds to the moral that George's investment in his native town pays off well for him as well as for others -- an early illustration of the advice to ""Think globally, act locally.""

The story is told in microcosm in the scene where George's mother sends him to Mary Hatch's house.  This is one of several scenes where George's frustration seethes and boils over, but it's here that he knows it's finally done for keeps.  More surely than the angel Clarence Oddbody, Mary Hatch represents salvation in this funny, terrible, iconic moment.  James Stewart and Donna Reed are splendid in it.",1356220800,,942,4.7073170731707314
41027,5,0782010792,"Have you ever had the thought that things would be better if you were never born ? Well, I have and I'm sure many others have had the thought too. This heart warming movie with Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is one of my four must see movies for the Holidays and my most favorite of all. You have-to love the children and Clarence too. The chemistry between the lead characters is magic and  Donna Reed is a knockout. This Holiday movie is so good it'll send you to the moon. My four must see holiday movies are... It's a Wonderful Life - A Christmas Carol w/Alastair Sims - A Bishops Wife w/Carey Grant - and A Miracle on 34th St w/Natalie Wood.",1356220800,,644,4.235772357723577

Well anyway I love this cartoon show and I just want to say thanks! And Merry Christmas!

This is the DVD set (and not the Blu-ray set) that includes both the B&W and Colorized versions of the movie.  I haven't opened my set yet because I am disappointed that it DIDN'T come with the Collectible O-Sleeve Artwork as shown in the product picture on Amazon - AND as described as being included with this DVD set (see ""Special Features"" of the product listing). The Collectible O-Sleeve is usually a cardboard-type envelope or slipcover that slides over the DVD case.

This DVD set, as it appears in the product listing photo, shows the Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed characters framed within a circle.  I DIDN'T receive that!. I don't know why this happened.  I am a collector so I feel let down and may return it for either a refund or replacement.  Have to rate the movie 4 stars due to the fact that the product that was shipped to me is NOT the same one as shown and described in the Amazon listing for this particular DVD edition.

41214,5,0782010792,"Here I am, just another reviewer acknowledging the immortal significance of this gritty but sentimental, sometimes harsh but more often joyous, deliberate but life-affirming treasure that is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (hereafter ""Wonderful Life"").  Do I have a new perspective on ""Wonderful Life""?  Maybe, but I doubt it, but here goes:  It has often struck me how ""Wonderful Life"" is sort of the inversion and distorted reflection of ""A Christmas Carol"".

  George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge - can any two characters be more diametrically opposed? George is kind-hearted, thoughtful of others, beloved by the citizenry; Ebenezer is uncaring, misanthropic, and treated with fearful disregard.  The only thing they seem to have in common is that both are industrious and, surprisingly, both dissatisfied with their lots.  However, although rich with public esteem, George admits his despondent dissatisfaction with his relatively ""poor"" financial status. Conversely, although rich with material goods, Ebenezer harbors dissatisfaction with his relatively poor social/human status, that is, his alienation, though he will hardly admit this.  In a subtle, distorted way, George and Ebenezer kinda want what the other has - the only difference is, ironically, what Ebenezer subconsciously wants is better than what George wants.

  Of course, both men receive spiritual intervention and of course, get a glimpse of their futures.  Only difference is, George receives a vision of what the future would be if he did not continue his altruistic ways, while Scrooge receives a vision of what the future would be if he DID continue his selfish, parsimonious ways.  For both men, both visions promise stark oblivion (in different ways, of course).  Both men's future visions, for different reasons, convince them that selfless interaction with society is the path to bliss; George just needed to be reminded of it, while Ebenezer needed a remedial course.

  Therefore, in my opinion, many parallelisms and common themes exist between ""Wonderful Life"" and ""Christmas Carol"" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.",1347408000,3,2142,5.4984709480122325
41215,5,0782010792,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is my favorite Christmas film.  My other three (3) are: BAD SANTA, A CHRISTMAS CAROL (ALASTAIR SIM version) and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION ...so I have my mix of funny and tear-jerkers.  IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is not only one of my favorite Christmas movies, but it's one of my favorite films period due to it's central message i.e. No One Is Born In Vain!!  I watch it every Christmas ...and I get choked-up every Christmas when I watch it.

All of us, in our lives, experience downtimes, despressing times, hardtimes where like George Bailey (played perfectly by Jimmy Stewart aka the common man) think things and the people in our lives would be better-off if he weren't around i.e. if he were never born.  This film illustrates that no matter how bad things get e.g. foreclosure (the possibility of), prison (the possibility of), death (in the family) that things will get better.  It's just we cannot quit.  We just have to keep on fighting and not let negativity grip us and bring us down into the darkness where we expect bad things to happen, therefore pushing us to be fulfillers of our own negative prophecies.

We all go about our day, just like George Bailey performing, what we perceive to be little things, kind gestures. This movie powerfully shows-us the impact these ""little things"", these gestures have on so people ...and if we were never around the terrible void it would leave in other people's lives.  It also shows the tremendous chain reaction life's moments have on other moments, and how these moments affect so many people ...people we are not even cognizant of in our own lives. Such as, if George never lived his brother Peter would have died an early death because George would have not been around to save him which consequently would have caused Peter's military regiment to die in war because Peter Bailey wouldn't have been around to save them.

We all have purpose!  Many times, it feels as though ""Nothing ever goes right for me!"" or ""Everybody hates me/you!"" or ""There isn't meaning to anything I am doing!"".  But, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE powerfully depicts there is reason for us being here, and if we were not here an ""awful hole"" would exist.

SIDENOTE: This movie should ONLY be in Black & White.  There are versions out there that have this movie in color ...such versions are blasphemy!!",1346198400,3,2360,4.73838630806846

41217,5,0782010792,"I fell in love with this ""little known"" Capra classic after being inundated with it when it was public doman in the 70's. At one point you could see it on multiple channels, 7 days a week during the holidays. Then NBC (I think) bought the rights and begain rationing it like they do with ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"". Now if you miss the one or 2 showings a year, well you've missed it. Now with the advent of home video you can see it anytime, anyplace. I like the transfer and the special features of the 2 disk set. It's exactly what I wanted and what I paid for. The only problem is it's been loaned out by family members and I can't get it back. Probably have to buy a second helping. I hate relatives...

41218,5,0782010792,"Frank Capra didn't make any money off this movie, so he let the copyright expire, which meant the TV studios picked it up, and showed it, because they didn't have to pay royalties.  I saw it before it came out on TV.  It is a classic, one of Capra's best.  It is also maudlin, yet very inspiring.  Well worth seeing.

41220,4,0782010792,"OK, we've all seen this movie dozens of times. But one great advantage of DVDs is that you get the special features to tell you about the movie. Do you know WHY you have seen it so often? Because due to a clerical error, the copyright was not renewed when it came up for renewal, and it was in the public domain. So TV stations could play it as often as they liked without having to pay a royalty. So they played it a lot, especially around Christmas. It became an American tradition. Once VCRs were invented, and then DVDs, people could have it in their homes whenever they wanted.

Oh, yes, it's a unique movie, and very good in a lot of ways, but did you know that it was not a box office hit? It only became a big hit after it went into the public domain. So you love it in part because you associate it with Christmas traditions, and childhood and being happy.

Certainly it's a wonderful life if you are George Bailey, but not many of us are. And Clarence's inscription in the book he leaves for George thanking him for his wings says no man is a failure as long as he had friends. But how many of us have a whole town (less the crabby old skinflint and his minions) to be our friends?

Maybe I'm just being terribly cynical, but I'm not George Bailey, doing things to help people, being the reason they are able to buy a home, saving lives through quick thinking and action, like the little kid who would have been poisoned or his brother, who would have drowned.

Clarence gave George a unique opportunity when he showed him what Bedford Falls would have been like if he had never been born. Wonder what would be different in this world if I had not been born. And maybe that was Frank Capra's point: not that we are all as lucky as George Bailey, but that we have all had an impact, small or large. For good or ill, the world really would be a different place if any one of us had never existed. I hope I am not flattering myself when I say that on the whole, the world is better off for having me in it. What about you?

I will give this four stars out of sheer sentiment.",1337385600,4,2082,4.169154228855722

41249,4,0782010792,"This movie ""Ist das Leben nicht schoen"" (Its a wonderful life) is in the german speaking part unknow and only rare showed on TV. I think I'v seen it before only partial once in the past 20 years. I decited to watching the colorized version first. First I thought it would looks terrible like those ""Our Gang"" colored versions but hey.. it looks much better than I thought.

Both versions looks on Blu-Ray beautiful restored.

The story is heart-breaking and James Stewart is always great in his role but I think just a little bit to old (in my mind). But whatever, its a great Cast: Donna Mills, Gloria Grahaem, Beulah Bondi, Lionel Barrymore and the children (where still living): Carol Combs and Karolyn Grimes.

TRIVIA:
- in a very small role as Freddie Othello (Mary's annoying high school suitor): Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer  (yes, the one Alfalfa from ""Our Gang""!!!!).
- Directors Trademark: The bird (Jimmy the raven) appeared since 1938 in each of Frank Capra's movies.
- nice inside joke: when James Stewart is running trough the city and is wishing everyone a merry Christmas, we can see a shot of a theater marque advertising for The Bells of St. Mary's. Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, had co-starred in the film the previous year.

The Music was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin but partial stock/archive material by Leigh Harline, Alfred Newman, Roy Webb was used for this movie.

FAZIT: its a wonderful wonderful movie. Which version you do prefer will be your own decision. But when you hate the colored version then remember - it was once considered to shoot the movie in technicolor, but the laboratory wasn't able to deliver it.

This is evident in his other movies also. He brings genuine feelings and emotions to all his acting scenes and his acting is so full of feeling. Just to mention some other films where he shows some great kisses, are Vertigo, Seventh Heaven, Rear Window, and the list goes on.

By the way, I think the worst screen kiss I ever saw was in the last scene of Miracle on 34th Street starring Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne, and others.
It is the kiss between John Payne and Maureen O'Hara. It looked very harsh and with no finesse. It certainly did not fit in this type of movie as well.",1328745600,,697,4.320610687022901

41254,5,0782010792,"This by far is one of the best movies period, people miss the point on it though. George isn't a born loser as some have suggested, this movie shows us through George, how many people one man or one person really can effect. IT IS GEORGE WHO HAS TO LEARN THE LESSON, he has to watch his brother become a war hero. His highschool friends go off and become sucessful business men and women, while all of his plans are put on hold so he can run the ""Baily building and loan"" even after he gets married and has a couple of kids, he still doesn't feel like he's accomplishing anything in life. This all comes to ahead when his uncle misplaces eight thousand dollars, which is now in Potter's hands. George goes home, and it's the straw that broke the camel's back. He goes crazy, and runs out of the house. Eventually he finds himself at the bridge outside of town, contemplating suicide. When his guardian angel shows up, causing George to jump in and rescue him, while they're in the rescue station, George states that he wishes he'd never been born, because in his mind as he states. Everybody would've been much happier, the angel grants his wish. And George gets to see how things would been around town, without him, His brother would be dead, since he wasn't there to save him from falling in the frozen pond. Mary never got married, and became and old maid, and Potter controls everything. No Bailey building and loan, George ends back at the bridge and wishes that he had been born. Which is granted to him, George is now resigned to the fact that yes he can make a difference. He even expects to go to jail over the lost eight thousand dollars, but Mary has been praying for him. And has gone out to talk to friends, and at the end the money is raised. This movie shows that what you do in life, no matter how small. Is important, and you impact more people than you realize. Even if you think you don't, George's problem was that he saw wasn't doing, or didn't have. And couldn't see the friends he had, and had to humble himself to ask for their help, an awsome awsome movie.",1327622400,3,2082,4.368556701030927

A classic tale of a man with dreams that keeps pushing those dreams out further while he takes care of responsibilities for his family; he marries has a great family and once again, a family member makes a mistake for which he will need to pay...probably with prison time.  For once, he becomes depressed and is granted a wish to never have been born; he returns to his town and is shown how many lives would be impacted if he never existed.

Although not a usual fan of colorization, the other reviews left me very intrigued.  Since the price was right, I had to get this version - and I am glad I did.  The colorization is subtle, believable and most of all, does not detract.  It enhances the experience.  I watched it on Christmas night and it STILL makes me shed a tear or two at the end.

The B&W is that awesome in clarity and though I'm not a fan of colorized, this one can almost convert you.

41351,5,0782010792,"One of our family's favorite Christmas traditions is watching Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and eating rocky road candy.

Just about everyone knows the story of George Bailey.  George is an ambitious young man who, due to extenuating circumstances, finds himself shackled to his deceased father's struggling Savings and Loan business.  George does good and honorable work, but he never realizes his personal dreams and vision of success.  Then when tragedy strikes on Christmas Eve he faces the biggest personal challenge of his life.

This film, though a well-known holiday favorite today, was not a hit when it was released.  So, how did this film gain top-holiday movie status?  Do you remember a few decades ago when many of the cable TV stations were just getting off of the ground...TNT, USA, etc.?  If you recall, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" aired several times each holiday season for a number of years on a several different channels.  This happened because this film at that time had passed into the public domain.  So, these new cable TV stations could show it without having to pay any royalties!  It was free to them.

When you combine that repeated pattern of showings until the copyright was renewed, with Frank Capra and a heartwarming Christmas story, people came to know and love this movie.

I mean, what's not to love?  You have James Steward, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore headlining the show.  I have heard it said that casting Lionel Barrymore as the cantankerous miser, Mr. Potter, was pure genius.  If you look at his other roles he typically played warm, grandfatherly characters, but not in ""It's a Wonderful Life""!.

The acting is great, and though the story line and characters have a strong Norman Rockewellian flavor, this film is well worth watching every Christmas season.

All I wanted in the privacy of my home was to see again this beautiful movie as close to the original as possible.  The movie itself was excellent and came across beautifully in this latest addition.  But I hated having all this advertisement blaring at me before it got started.  I would expect this perhaps in a movie theater  but not in the privacy of my home! I suppose this complaint will quickly be put in the ""do nothing"" file.

41354,3,0782010792,"Everybody raves about this movie, saying that Christmas wouldn't be complete without it, and that it is Jimmy Stewart's best role.
It may have a wonderful ending, but this movie scared me as a little kid.  In fact, it terrified me.
When he shows up at his house and his own wife doesn't recognize him because he had never existed, it was maybe the most terrifying thing that a young child could imagine.
And she even looks like a completely different person - a harpy, compared to his real life, sweet wife.
Up until the end, it was a dark and foreboding movie, portraying the cruelty and heartlessness of people.
And so I don't have warm and fuzzy memories of this movie, at all, nor do I even think it is a particularly good Christmas movie, in spite of the final few minutes.
He is dissuaded from jumping into the river by an angel, and says he wishes he had never been born.

41373,5,0782010792,"To those of you, who, like me, have watched this a hundred thousand times, why do we do it?

I mean, it's way too long and stylistically confused; starting off sentimental and romantic and compellingly real before turning into a prototype Twilight Zone with the introduction of Clarence Oddbody.  The ending is heartfelt but somehow feels incomplete and wrong.

Why is this movie - which in fact tanked at the box office and was more-or-less shrugged off by the critics at the time - such a classic?  Is it only because we've been told for decades that It's A Wonderful Movie Classic so we're supposed to automatically shut up and not judge?

Of course not.  It's a classic not thanks to its erratic narrative, but to how well the sincere performances and Frank Capra's precision as director hold this weird mix of styles together.  Jimmy Stewart's range of emotions and passions, plus Donna Reed's incomparable blend of sweet and sexy, are still two of the finest performances in the history of movies, and wonderful lessons to any aspiring film actors.

There are enough great scenes in it...Mr. Gower smacking young George around then doing an immediate about-face on realizing his serious error...these are all Pavlov-type moments that just Do It for me, forever and always.  Even if we only keep seeing our favourite bits each year instead of the whole damned thing, it's enough, don't you think?

Filmmakers take heart: you don't have to be perfect, because this ain't.

But God, it's good.  Because It's A Wonderful Cast.

The B&W version looks about as expected, twice the resolution of the 2007 release.

The Blu-ray color version looks about the same as the 2007 restored color DVD version.

So if you are a huge fan of the movie and you want the highest resolution, get the Blu-ray on sale.

When Amazon.com had this for one of its Lightning Cyber Monday Deals this past week, I did a blind buy for both the bluray and DVD formats based upon the amount of positive reviews.  Boy, I was right.  Worth every penny.  The movie is so great that I'v watched both the color and B&W versions in bluray.  The making of documentary was also great.  I became an instant fan of the movie and not to mention the beauty of Donna Reed.  The message of the movie is so classic and touching that I could watch it over and over again.

I have the older DVD Silver Screen edition in black and white and was happy with it, but after comparing the two...hands down the Blu Ray wins, both black and white and colorized.  I say this because the Blu Ray version is so clean it is hard to believe that this movie was released on December 20, 1946.  The only flaw with this movie ""that I have seen"" and it is on both my DVD and this Blu Ray is on chapter 15-01:13:55 where the screen size changes and at Chapter 18-01:26:57 where it changes back to normal, this may have been a flaw from the original editing of the movie...other than that if you want a dramatic increase in picture quality then go with this Blu Ray version, you will not be dissapointed.

The acting by Jimmy Stewart is superb because his performance is realistic and it allows the audience to establish a connection with him. The music and cinematography also compliment the movie by setting joyous and somber mood.

41412,5,0782010792,"What really struck me about Jimmy Stewart's performance is how he played the film's protagonist George Bailey as he passes through various stages in his life.  I first saw this film when I was in my 20's, so seeing Steward play the character as an impatient young man was illuminating.  At the point in the story where all of George's friends have just finished college, while he is still stuck in Bedford Falls tending to the Bailey family's Savings and Loan, strikes a familiar chord.  At that time in my life I was a weary engineering graduate student, and felt that my life would never really get going.  Stewart plays George Bailey at that age as sullen and indifferent to any possibility that his life might take a turn for the better.  George is played by Stewart in such a way that he struggles betray no interest in Donna Reed's character Mary, the girl who had admired George her entire life--and who George will eventually marry.",1300838400,,940,4.63855421686747

Though often and incorrectly referred to as only a Christmas movie - it is that but so much more! - IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE brings to life a simpler time in American life and culture, the best of which we're always trying to get back to.

One thing that really amazes me is that the hero of the movie, George Bailey, was not allowed to serve in World War II, because he was 4-F, a status that drove some men to suicide!  And here it is, 1946, right after the end of WWII, and our protagonist and hero is 4-F!  I often wonder what that did to the morale of many of the 4-F men who desperately wanted to serve.

For many of us who live in small town America, there is an even greater connection and appreciation for Bedford Falls and its inhabitants.  No, George you can't leave that crummy old town.  You need it as much as it needs you.",1299110400,2,960,4.3

41470,2,0782010792,"Two-star rating is for technical quality, not the merit of this classic Frank Capra holiday film.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first motion pictures to undergo computer colorization in the mid-1980s. Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.

Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run ""Wonderful Life"" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.

Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his ""fellow travelers.""

SYNOPSIS--
After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.

A year after this picture, Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven starred in THE BISHOP'S WIFE. Here, Grant is angel Dudley, come to help Bishop Brougham and his wife Julia. Unlike Capra's often dark tale, this one's consistently light and charming. One of Cary Grant's best movies.

The whole thing smacks too much of teen angst--""they'll be sorry when I'm gone!""  Although people do have many disappointments in life, these are generally not crunched together in narrative form and thus tend to depress the person living through them---and in this case us---to a lesser extent.  The next good fortune manages to mitigate the last bad luck event.  The novel prospect of seeing the world without oneself is the most entertaining part of the film.

EVERY major character is developed, you enter the story, HATE Mr. Potter when he tries to get a good guy arrested, etc.  Gritty enough to have a near suicide, touching enough to be a great Christmas movie emphasizing importance of family and friends.

It took a while for the storyline to get to the segments I REALLY had the greatest admiration for, such as when James Stewart's character was forced to learn an important lesson about respecting people (and subsequently taken to a time when nobody even knew who he was because he never existed- you'll understand this segment when you see it) *this* is when the storyline really kicked in for me.

It was a lot of fun watching James Stewart's character communicate with people he knew really well around town, however, none of those people knew him at all thanks to an angel taking him to a world where he was never even created.  It was both emotional and exciting wondering what would happen next thanks to James Stewart's reactions and facial expressions.

I really liked James Stewart's character too. He really disrespected his family for a while there, but by being shown the way of life, he learned to treat everyone around town with respect and consideration.

The entire storyline is really good so I honestly feel really bad for originally skipping over the movie so many times simply because of its age. Don't let age fool you- this my friends, is a holiday classic.",1293148800,2,1611,4.6749116607773855

 George Bailey is a quintessential American in this most American of films: From childhood, this bright, energetic youth wants to ""shake the dust of this crummy little town"" Bedford Falls from his feet, see the world, build things, do great deeds. But ... while his mind wants to do things for himself, his spirit instinctively and unhesitatingly drives him to help others. He saves his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in one ear in the process; he saves his part-time employer the druggist Mr. Gower from accidentally poisoning a family with a prescription wrongly mixed while Gower is mourning the death of his son. Later, as an adult, George Bailey saves his late father's savings and loan from the clutches of the grasping millionaire Henry F. Potter, the ""meanest man in town"" who puts us greatly in mind of Ebenezer Scrooge.

 George marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Hatch. The scene I remember the most clearly from the first time I saw the film, as a child, was the one where little Mary whispers into little George's left ear, which she believes he can't hear out of, ""George Bailey, I'll love you 'til the day I die!"" I've often wondered if he really didn't hear her -- or whether he just showed a remarkable self-possession for a young boy in not reacting.

 Potter, thwarted in his efforts to destroy the Bailey Savings & Loan, finally calls George to his office one day and offers him ""the chance of a lifetime"" -- employment as Potter's properties manager, at an un-heard of (in 1946) $20,000 a year, trips to New York City and Europe for himself and his wife ... One thinks of Jesus Christ wandering in the desert, and Satan appearing and offering him all the riches in the world if he will only betray his mission on earth. George Bailey almost succumbs -- until he shakes hands with Potter, realizes what he's about to do, and with an angry wave of disgust, says, in effect, ""Get thee behind me, Potter!""

 The years pass, George and Mary have four children -- and then one day George's kind but bumbling uncle, Billy Bailey, loses $8,000 in cash of the savings and loan's money while on the way to deposit it in the bank. Events quickly spiral into the crucial night of George Bailey's life.

 All is resolved happily in the denouement, of course; Americans have always demanded happy endings. This one is almost overwhelming, with all the people who have appeared in the film gathered in the Bailey living room on Christmas Eve, having come to the rescue of this unselfish, self-sacrificing man who has helped so many of them. As the camera pans all the by-now familiar faces, the crowd sings ""Auld Lang Syne."" One is reminded of certain Shakespeare plays which also ended with a sing-along by the cast. Meanwhile, George, Mary and little Zuzu, their youngest child, decide that Clarence the Angel's saying, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings,"" is true indeed.

 The casting and direction of this movie are impeccable. It was the last and greatest of Frank Capra's series of ""triumph of the little man"" movies. James Stewart probably never gave a better performance; Donna Reed, not a towering star, was nevertheless just right as Mary Bailey. Lionel Barrymore's villain Potter is convincing to the nth degree. Thomas Mitchell, one of the great character actors, does a wonderful job as Uncle Billy, whose simple goodness is attested by the animals (the crow, the squirrel) who fly and scurry to him as to a close friend.

 Is ""It's A Wonderful Life"" the best movie ever made? I don't know; most reviewers wouldn't rank it quite that high. But it's a wonderful film.",1292284800,3,3895,4.768202080237741

The movie that will forever be director Frank Capra's masterpiece.  ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a fantastic story of a man with big dreams that he watches slip away as life's responsibilities take hold of him.  We watch George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) go from wide-eyed dreamer to a broken man convinced the world would be a better place without him.  Stewart shows fantastic range in the movie, which is not the pure, sappy, feel-good movie it is so frequently portrayed as.  It has those elements, but there is also a dark side to the movie that is often overlooked.  This is my all-time favorite film, bar none.  And while most people view it as a Christmas movie, I think it should be enjoyed all year long.

The 60th Anniversary Edition has a beautiful black and white presentation of the film.  For bonus features you get the original trailer and two featurettes - ""A Personal Remembrance"" with Frank Capra Jr. and ""The Making of..."" hosted by (the late) Tom Bosley.  Both are rather old (early 1990s) but still very interesting.  The newer 2 disc edition contains this same DVD along with a second disc containing a colorized version of the film.  Unless you're a fan of colorized movies, I'd recommend saving your money and picking up the 60th Anniversary Edition.  The Blu-ray has the same contents as the 2 disc DVD.",1292198400,3,1867,6.214007782101167
41496,5,0782010792,"This weekend is the 64th anniversary of that great old film, It's a Wonderful Life.  I found that this weekend is also the It's a Wonderful Life festival at Seneca Falls, NY, which claims it was the inspiration for Bedford Falls (see their site here: [...], which also includes an appearance by Karolyn Grimes, who was the character Zuzu and her pedals).

But what a story!  I'm sure most readers know this story and the DVD I picked up had a lot of interesting extras and ""making of"" that was fascinating.

The film is a slice of Americana, taking us from the Roaring 20s to the post-war era of the mid 1940s.  Featured is George  Bailey, the son of a small town building and loan president, whose kind heart and common sense had kept the town running for years.

On the other side of the spectrum is old Potter, a miserly miser that makes Scrooge look generous by comparison.

The story's general plot goes through George's life through the eyes of an angel, a little guy who wants to earn his wings.  He watched with the viewer as George grows up:  George prevents several deaths, gets the town through a run on the bank during the '29 Depression and gets through the war.  He has kids and runs a successful business that is booming.

Despite these successes, his uncle loses money that was accidentally given to the Potter miser.  Potter looks at this as an opportunity to finally beat George.

Jimmy Stewart's acting ability was amazing in this film.  His range from pure happiness to deep despair was palpable.  Despite his personal sacrifices to give up his dreams for the benefit of others, George Bailey was finally at the end of his rope.  Stewart's performance as a broken man on that bridge was just an amazing piece of cinema.

No Man Is a Failure Who Has Friends:

Many themes in this film too many to mention, really.  There is a reason why this film has endured as a Christmas treat.  It is deep and philosophical without being preachy.  It has a dark side that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.  The film raises you up and makes you think.

What if you had never been born?  What hole would be hard to fill without your contribution to people around you and to Man as a species?  Would lives have been better off if you had never existed?

DVD Specials:

I enjoyed the bits with Frank Capra's son as he went over his father's inspiration for the film.  They showed a clip from an interview with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra himself.  It's Capra's favorite film.

The DVD also has a brief spot with Tom Bosley who again goes over similar ground to the bit on the ""making of"" segment, but adds some film history.  It's a Wonderful Life was not a hit at the box office at its release.  In fact, viewers thought it too depressing for the holiday season (which I find simply unbelievable).

When the film fell into the public domain, it was shown on TV in the 70s and there was a revival for it.  Now we have Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) touring the country pushing the film.  Karolyn has an endearing and powerful personal story herself, which I wish was part of the DVD set.

Bottom Line:  An enduring, heartwrenching film (for me, anyway) that nearly always makes me cry as well as makes me look at my life.  Would it had been better I'd never been born?  For George Bailey the answer is a resounding no!",1292112000,3,3365,4.470394736842105
41497,5,0782010792,"""It's A Wonderful Life""  was released in 1946 and has played on TV almost as long.  It is an annual Christmas watch for me, along with ""Scrooge"" to absorb the Season's Spirit.  Overall it has a kind and generous message, although you sometimes feel it is corny, it works.  The main character, George Bailey, is played by Jimmy Stewart .  George has a problem at the bank he manages.  The examiners are there and $8,000 is missing.  A greedy, mean-spirited bank president finds the $8,000 in cash and keeps it to make George's life miserable.  George has  serious problems and contemplates suicide and drives his old car to a  lonely snowy spot on the town's bridge.  His guardian angel  ""Clarence"" played by Henry Travers appears and jumps in before George!  George jumps to rescue him and they end up drying clothes in a small shack together.  George wishes he had never been born and his wish comes true.  Clarence gives him the wish, and tours George through the town as it would have been without him.  It shows how George sacrificed his education for his brother's (who becomes a war hero), he kept the savings and loan going for his family, and  protected the small town from the avarice and greed of Mr. Potter.  George also married his beautiful childhood sweetheart (Donna Reed).  If none of this had happened, the town would have hit bottom and lives would have been wasted.  George saw what might have been and learned his life was important.  In the end, the town came together with plenty of money to save the Savings and Loan and his reputation.  The only ""open-ended"" item was why Mr. Potter never gave the stolen  $8,000 back to the bank he ran.",1292112000,,1661,4.613013698630137
41498,5,0782010792,"It was postwar America.  Frank Capra, a legend in his own time, read a short story entitled ""The Greatest Gift"" by Phillip Van Doren Stern. With his team he wrote a screenplay based on the story, and It's A Wonderful Life was born.

There was a great deal of excitement on December 20, 1946 as the finished film premiered at New York's Globe Theatre. Reviews were mixed.  Perhaps it was because of the postwar mentality.

Audiences did not embrace it in the winter of 1947.  It did not break even at the box office. A fantasy film with so much wholesomeness was a bit hard to swallow after years of war with wounds still so fresh.

It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Film, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound).  The postwar drama, The Best Years of Our Lives, would take all the awards and all the praise as well as being the top grossing film.  Frank Capra did receive the Golden Globe for director.

As things tend to be over time, It's A Wonderful Life found a new audience and new generations on television in the 70's and 80's, even though the film copies were poor and edited badly.

Now in its restored version, it is viewed as the holiday favorite in December.  NBC has exclusive rights for its showing.

This 2 Disc DVD has a colorized version as well as the pristine black/white. The black and white version gives a vivid life to the characters and Bedford Falls.  There is a nice tribute to Frank Capra in this set.

It is a story of hope, love, redemption, and simple goodness.

If you had to choose as a neighbor and friend George Bailey or Henry Potter, who would be your choice? I think we all know people like Bailey and Potter. Of course, we all know a place like Bedford Falls.

I hope this brief history of the film has been of value to you.  I did not see the point in repeating what had been written about the characters and story.

As I was growing up this film was shown repeatedly on television as it had lapsed into the public domain. Somehow, it was retrieved from public domain with some legal wrangling - and though at first I thought of that as a bad thing the quality of the film has benefited now that there is money to be made on this old classic. The initial DVDs available for this film from the public domain era were very poor quality and only recently were better scans completed. That process has been taken to ""the nth degree"" for the blu-ray release.

For this review I did watch the first few minutes of the Republic Pictures DVD version which last time I checked into this was the best transfer available. I recall when first seeing it that it was far superior to other versions and light-years ahead of the worn prints that used to be shown on TV. I played it on an upscaling player (actually my Sony Blu-Ray player). I then put in the Blu-Ray version and I was blown away at the improvement. The quality is really striking with facial detail and readable text, for example, on the bottles in Mr. Gower's Pharmacy. The print is totally clean and is as others have pointed out shown in the correct aspect ratio in which it was made. This means there are black bars at the sides on a wide-screen TV and this is normal and how it should be. To fill a wide screen TV would mean either stretching things so that the thin James Stewart starts to look more like Alfred Hitchcock or cutting off the top and bottom of the picture. Either of those options would go a long way toward destroying this classic. Sound quality is also excellent and clean.

As I write this I am watching the colorized version which I feel is less impressive. While colorization has come a long way and looks less like paint-by-numbers than it used to it is still obviously added color and just distracting for us purists that love the original B&W. That said, I wonder if the colorized version will be something that might make this film more accessible to kids (though I am planning on showing the original to my 5 and 7 year old kids!)

All in all, this is a fantastic buy and is a must-have for those that love this film and have a blu-ray player. I highly recommend it.",1289692800,218,2494,4.356989247311828

This STAR CLASSICS dub of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first videotapes I ever bought, way back in 1986. A budget-priced item that comes in an oversized cardboard box with tucked-in flaps at top and bottom, it's a slow speed transfer of only middling quality. There's no HiFi audio track, only a linear one. The film itself is unrestored and has a less than pristine picture.

Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run ""Wonderful Life"" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.

Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his ""fellow travelers.""

SYNOPSIS--
After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.

41510,2,0782010792,"This GOODTIMES version of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) is recorded in LP speed and doesn't contain a HiFi audio track.

Slower speed non-HiFi tapes have degraded picture quality, with sound clarity that's dependent on the alignment of your machine's playback head (a stationary device similar to the sort found in a cassette deck). The slightest variation in azimuth from the mfr's dubbing unit means blurry audio, often with a background squeal. Additionally, such slow-moving tracks have limited frequency range and an increased amount of flutter.

All HiFi videotapes come with a back-up linear track such as described above, but on HiFi VCRs the sound, which is laid down on a slant alongside the video portion, is picked up by the rotating video drum. This simulates a tape moving at an enormous rate of speed. The advantage is a frequency response, dynamic range and harmonic distortion level that nearly equals CDs in quality (if you connect your VCR's audio outs to a decent amplifier).

All pedantry aside, for anyone still seeking a videotape of this classic film, choose one from a major studio rather than a budget brand like GOODTIMES.",1279152000,2,1162,5.041666666666667

I thought the picture was very clean, and the color that was added to the color version was dulled down to look as if it was really part of the original film.  I thought this was very well done, and gave it more of a warm feeling.  Take into consideration though that both versions are still in the 4:3 format.  So you will still have large black bar on the sides.  But I was amazed with how much clearer the picture was than the original TV aired version.  Not to mention the story of this timeless classic.

It is a story that life is not all about the little things that we seem to focus on far to much of these days.  That life is about friends and what you put into the world around you, and about how wonderful life really can be if you take the time to realize it.  This is a great way to preserve this classic movie.  If you have not seen it, do so, or at least watch it on tv!!",1267056000,8,1364,4.048689138576779

I received the format in black & white and color (which I did not want, the color version I mean). James Stewart played the part of George Baily like no other person could have done. His girl-next-door wife played by Dianna Reed was the perfect part for a woman with her charms. I think we all have regrets in life over what we have done and have not done and plan to do. But this movie helps to keep us focused on the people around you and how your treatment of them affects them for years to come. Each of us influences the other and touches them in large and small ways, and the effects are long-lasting. It's A Wonderful Life also tells us that you don't have to work at some big Wall Street Firm, or in Hollywood, or in politics to make a difference. We all make a difference in our own way. Choosing to do good us up to us. You won't be disappointed with this movie.

I had a colorized version on VHS years ago that was ghastly. This new colorization is amazing. The color version comes on its own separate DVD.  It doesn't stray from the look of early color movies.  This colorization has the same color quality of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  It looks very natural for older period color films.  I imagine the Blu-ray is even better.  However, I must note that even the Blu-ray is a square picture like a standard def 4:3 television.  That's because that square-ish aspect ratio is the original aspect ratio.

1) The police try to shoot George for hitting one of them. Talk about police brutality!
2) In George's alternate life, we find that Mary had the very worst possible thing happen to her: she became an old maid!. Her eyesight aapparently also suffered from this as she ended up wearing glasses too.
3) George and Clarence get thrown out of a bar for talking about 200 year old angels. Those Potterville bars sure had high standards for their drunken patron's conversations!
4) I would also question George's sanity for letting Uncle Billy handle a $8,000 deposit which I'm guessing would represent somewhere around $200,000 of today.
5) The simple, even naive way the movie starts with the stars speaking to one other. There you can also hear someone praying to ""Jesus, Mary and Joseph"". I bet somebody would attack that for being ""un-politically correct"" these days.
I also noticed for the first time that with all the heavy snowing when George is on the bridge, not a single flake actually sticks to his clothes; Harry's hat in his final scene also seems to be refrigerated as the snow on it stays while that on his shoulders melts. The Christmas decoration switching on and off his arm when he talks to Harry long distance is also very funny.",1261958400,,1467,4.6461538461538465

How is it possible for Amazon to have the same amount of reviews for a Blu-ray that is barely a month old and a DVD that is 3 years old. There is only one way, Amazon takes the DVD reviews and puts them under the Blu-ray product. I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but this practice borderlines false advertising. It's wrong, especially classic movies like this where the movie sells its self.

Amazon has to stop doing this practice. Please start listening to us customers, and please review the exact product we are researching for purchase. We especially want to know the quality of the Blu-ray against the DVD version. There are many Blu-ray versions out there that are not worth the purchase. In fact, the DVD played in a Blu-ray player actually looks and sounds better than the Blu-ray version. We will respect and trust Amazon reviews far more and you will have more loyal customers for it.

41593,5,0782010792,"I do not feel bad or weird at all for saying this: I am so offended by television now, I can only turn it on for seconds at a time to search through the guide for either The Bells of Saint Mary's, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Story, or It's a Wonderful Life.  I only turn it on occasionally for Christmas movies in other words.  Okay, so occasionally I might sneak in an old Andy Griffith Show as well, I won't deny that.  We as a nation and also as the global citizens of today need to seriously ask ourselves a question: What has become of us?  No really, what are we all becoming, and are we sure that we ever gave our consent to becoming it?  As we get older we tend to be more concerned for things like safety and morals, our children's safety and morals, living a good, simple life, and things of this sort.  This might even happen to you some day, but with all of the helevision programming being consumed into the youth's minds today, I literally shudder at what the future might look like.

People from my generation and from those before it remember hearing Christmas songs when we'd go into stores.  And I mean actual Christmas songs, none of this 'Jingle Bell Rock' garbage no, no it was 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' and real Christmas songs like that.  It created an enduring sense of sacred reverence and awe that is indescribable to people that have never experienced it.  But now I see that Christmas (and Christianity) is no longer ""politically correct."" Shame on everyone who has taken part in allowing this to happen.  It might seem like a victory for you now, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and I guarantee you, a dechristianized world is a world that even you do not want to live in.

That said, do give this movie an honest and objective try.  There is nothing quite like it that has ever been done in the cinematic form.  Maybe if we humble ourselves, educate our minds and work extra hard, God willing, we might get the nation back to a fit and moral state again.

I was tired the next day for school but my outlook on life and my fellow man was significantly refreshed.

Much was said, and rightly so, about the cheesy colorized verion in the 80s. Critics called it distorted and distracting and it was. This version is not and clearly reflects an amazing amount of effort and respect for the film. I feel the final product, with its painstaking attention to detail enhances rather than intrudes on the movie.

Arguments can be made that the film had its share of shadows and contrasts that color tends to soften. I believe that's why they provided a crisp B&W version as well.

41602,5,0782010792,"For film buffs it is not necessary to talk about Frank Capra, or its importance in film history, aesthetics or language. But since this film has had several home video incarnations, it is important to point out one that has made justice to the original negative and soundtrack.

This new edition also includes a colourized version, but no one is obliged to see it. Why would Paramount include such a version, with this kind of picture, is beyond my comprehension. Given that colourization emphasises colour distortion, especially on the actors' faces, and since the movie itself was never intended for colour photography, it is somewhat difficult to understand why anyone would like to see the film in this version. But, since the original is still there, no harm is done.

There are two Blu-ray discs, one containing the colorized version and the second disc has the original black & white movie, plus several special features.  While both versions look crisp and clear and free of any grain or softness (especially noticeable in the numerous night time scenes--the blacks look terrific).  Colorized versions of original B & W movies usually look horrible (poor color saturation, less sharp images--the 60th anniversary DVD color version suffered in this way)--but this one looks fantastic--natural color saturation and an image that is every bit as clear and sharp as the original B & W.  As I was watching the color version, it was hard to believe that this was not originally filmed in color.

Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, A Christmas Story, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, and even Ernest Saves Christmas are ideal motion pictures for this time of year. Many people, however, consider It's A Wonderful Life to be the finest Christmas film, and it's not hard to see why. It's a loose adaptation of Philip Van Doren Stern's short story called ""The Greatest Gift,"" and it tells of how wonderfully important your life really is, not only to yourself but to everyone that's close around you. It's well directed by Frank Capra, and it's one of the excellent motion pictures that that can really get you in the mood for the holiday spirit.

41609,5,0782010792,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of those films that should be at, or close to, the top of anyone's list of ""must-see"" movies. George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the end of his rope and he buys into Mr. Potter's (Lionel Barrymore) opinion that ""he is worth more dead than alive"". As a result of the prayers of his loved ones, George's guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers), comes to help. Clarence is somewhat inept as an angel and has only reached the rank of A1C (Angle first class). He has been promised that if he succeeds in helping George through his ""critical night"" he will finally earn his wings. Clarence learns that George, who dreams of traveling the world and becoming an architect, is a kind and generous fellow who constantly puts his dreams on hold when life gets in the way. George appears to take things in stride, especially after he marries Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and becomes the father of four children. But one unfortunate Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) misplaces $8,000 belonging to the Bailey Building and Loan. Even more unfortunate: the bank examiner wants to look at the books. A desparate George Bailey falls apart and in dispair decides to end his life. Enter Clarence...who gives George the ""gift"" of seeing what the world would be like if he had never been born. I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by revealing the details. Suffice it to say that there is a meaningful message in this wonderful film...that every life is of vital importance as it impacts every place and person with which it interacts. In addition to James Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell the film also boasts wonderful performances by Beulah Bondi (George's mother), Gloria  Grahame (Violet), and H.B. Warner (Mr. Gower). I personally prefer this black & white version. I like films to remain as they were created.",1259712000,,1889,4.848297213622291

The backgrounds have been rendered exceptionally well. In one scene, George is standing in the office of the Building and Loan, gazing at a portrait of his father on the wall. Under the portrait is a paper containing a quote, presumably one of his father's. I won't spoil it here but the quote can be read clearly by the viewer. In none of the previous releases of this film (VHS, DVD) has the clarity of the video been so well rendered.

The Colorized version is a big improvement over previous releases as well. The colors are vibrant and bright. In previous releases the colors (or what there were of them) were dull and faded in appearance. The BR release is a welcome change from those earlier versions.",1259366400,14,946,4.658682634730539

NOW for the FIRST time it has been brought up to the Blu-ray HD (1080p).  With the HD Home Theater (BIG SCREEN) w/Dolby Digital sound I', telling you this movie is NOW THE WAY IT WAS MENT TO BE SEEN IN THE MOVIE THEATER in 1946!!!  (Better then the original 35mm prints).

BONUS:  This Blu-ray (2 disc set) Edition includes 2 HD versions of this MUST HAVE Movie.  Disc 1. - The COLORIZED version (my favorite version, especially in HD. The color adds to the grand detail of the clarity ie. Jimmy Stewarts tweed jacket.
On the big Home Theater screen you won't believe how Wonderful the picture is!!!!
 And the sound is awesome!!!!

Disc 2 - Is the Original Black & White version.  A very good but much darker version which in my opinion mutes the HD details.  Still this HD Classic film delivers.  All extra features are also on this disc.

NOTE: This Blu-ray edition includes all the extras of the Standard DVD version.

I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it's nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you'll remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That's the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.

The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.

It is a total shame that for AFI's # 1 Most Inspiring Film of All Time that Paramount can't come up with NEW extras!  There is so much that could be done - but isn't.  The Tom Bosley featurette is centuries old - and was originally made for TV! And it isn't all that good to begin with. So ALL you get with this new packaging is...new packaging in a cheesy Christmas tree-backed box along with a cheap little bell with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" writ on it.  How wonderful if they had an ornament such as the one released by Hallmark in 1996 - a small tableau of George and Mary and ZuZu beside a Christmas tree.  That was a fantastic ornament!  But a tinny little bell is all you will get with this re-packaging.  So, if you have 2007's double disc set you have everything already - except for the tiny, tinny little bell.

This year's release of ""White Christmas"" at least had the dignity to include several NEW extras.  And as terrific as ""White Christmas"" is, it is nowhere near as beloved a film as ""Wonderful Life.""  Anyway - happy holidays to one and all.",1257465600,47,1208,4.352678571428571

Life is very hard and painful for a lot of people in the US today
and because the US middle class has been gutted they have no money
to buy the things developing countries make and the crisis
is worse in those countries as a result.

However, there is always having faith in God as a choice (yes or no).
It's always a choice......... essentially ""to be""  or.....  ""not to be"".
These are the same choice.
When we have nothing else but faith which enables the possibility of hope
then we have nothing else and nothing else.

But take a moment and look at the father in this movie. He struggles with his desire to fulfill a dream, always being frustrated to move in that direction, only to find that he has done more to help the people he loves than he will ever realize.
I talk to so many dads who see only their failures. Who work toward perfection in their life and the lives of their kids, only to realize that the point was not perfection, but only to give their kids a dad who loves them.

Too often, we mortals equate life with the acquiring of material possessions. And we realize, with the gaining of possessions, that the real value of life is not to be found in possessions. To have a wonderful life is to have dynamic relationships with people - not possessions. Things can never say ""thankyou,"" - people can. To the degree we pour our life into other people, is the degree we will find value in life.

The greatest point of the movie is often missed: our relationships with people will only take on significance as we find a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It is the living dynamic relationship with God that provides us a foundation upon which we can appreciate relationships with people.

And it's not just old movies, either.  When Steven Spielberg opted to cut costs by filming ""Schindler's List"" in black and white, he lost one ticket-buyer - me!

That's why I was THRILLED when they released a colorized version of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" the supposedly classic film starring James Stewart and Donna Reed.  Finally someone took the time to make an old, boring film look fresh and modern by using vibrant colors!

Did you know what color George Bailey's jacket was?  Well, it's black.  Did you know that the walls in Mr. Potter's office were gray, or that the snow in Bedford Falls was white?  You see, you'd never know these things if you only watched the inferior black and white version.

The best part about the colorized version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (other than the color) is that it's presented in fullscreen aspect ratio.  That means it doesn't have any of those annoying black bars on the top and bottom of the picture, making everything really small and hard to see.

In short, the colorization here is spectacular.

-----

DISC ONE -- There are NO differences between the first disc in this ""Two-Disc Collector's Set"" and the superbly restored black-and-white DVD released in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006</a>.  Disc One is EXACTLY THE SAME as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/60th-Anniversary-Edition-of-It-s-A-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">60th Anniversary Edition of ""It's A Wonderful Life</a>.""  It has the SAME special features, documentaries, trailers and improved subtitles.  The three-to-four VERY MINOR digital sound pops that tekkies brought up in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006</a>&nbsp;are still present - but as I wrote then - they WON'T be a big deal for most families watching a film like this made more than 60 years ago.

-----

DISC TWO -- This disc has the same pristine movie in ""COLOR.""  The results are stunning.  Disc Two offers optional subtitles and NO extras - and NO digital sound pops!

In my 2006 review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/60th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">60th Anniversary Edition</a>, I noted why I kept a ""colorized"" version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" on video tape (Republic Pictures Home Video, 1989).  Most youngsters prefer color.  As they get older, they come around to appreciating the artistry of black-and-white.  But early on, they still find it ""boring.""

I recommend fans AND critics of colorization to at least ""preview"" how much has changed since those chalky crayon efforts of the 1980s.  A high-tech company founded in 2001 called Legend Films, which specializes in restoring, colorizing and adding digital special effects - to NEW and OLD films - was commissioned to colorize ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for this ""Two-Disc Collector's Set.""

While the results don't match the color of today's live action films, they're still remarkable.  Given the titanic advances in digital special effects since 1989, I shouldn't have been surprised.  It isn't Technicolor, but the skin tones and background colors are more lifelike, enabling ""It's A Wonderful Life"" to JUMP off the screen like never before.  It looks brighter, cleaner and more beautiful.  You can almost smell Donna Reed's hair and see the panic in her brown eyes when James Stewart hovers over her when they're on the phone in the scene just before they get married.

Think of well-preserved color movies made during the 1940s or 1950s that weren't in Technicolor, but shot on different color film stock that's still beautiful today.  That's what the new colorized version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" looks like.  It's ""vintage"" color, not ""contemporary"" color.  And unless you're a technician who understands things like fading or shifting colors, you might not be able to tell the difference between what's original or colorized.  Why?  Because most of us are conditioned to expect LESS technical sophistication from films made in 1946 vs. 2006.

-----

Yes, colorization does alter an artist's ""original vision.""  But the technology behind it has improved tremendously in 20 years.  What this means to the future of colorizing black-and-white films, including ""untouchable"" classics - is a subject for another day.

The solution for tekkies?  Buy this ""Two-Disc Collector's Set,"" put colorized Disc Two into your player and simply turn down the color on your TV!  You'll now have the cleanest SOUND and PICTURE of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" ever - better than it was for audiences in 1946!  Moreover, it'll be easier to get your kids to watch the colorized version - before ""they graduate"" to the black-and-white original.  I hope this helps.",1229126400,422,4916,5.965714285714285
41662,5,0782010792,"Although this film has been around since long before I was born, I had never seen it until recently.  I did not know what I had been missing.

Featuring Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, this is a classic in every sense of the term.  Bailey is a regular guy living in an average town.  He has a brother who becomes a big war hero and a good friend who becomes very wealthy.  Not George.  He just keeps plugging away at his life.

A series of events hits him that leaves him very discouraged.  He is contemplating suicide and speculating that it would have been better had he never been born.  An angel is sent to help him.

During the course of the movie, the angel reveals to George many things and people that would have been worse off if not for his presence.  It is not only a great story, but it will also prompt viewers to consider that even seemingly small things that they do may have a big impact on others.

I highly recommend this movie for viewers of all ages and interests.",1228694400,2,984,4.2594594594594595

Now rarely on tv, this dvd is an entertaining, heart-warming story.  It only takes a viewing of this movie spectacular to put me right in the mood for Christmas.  James Stewart plays George Bailey who has led his entire life giving of himself to help others when a banking error by his uncle could end it all for poor George.

An angel comes to his rescue and shows George what life would have been without him.  With the beautiful Donna Reed as his wife and gruff and mean Mr. Potter played by the highly talented Lionel Barrymore, this dvd is a must for any collection, and epecially any library of Christmas classics.",1227571200,2,734,4.53030303030303

In a world that's forever beating us down with reminders of our isolation and of the lack of meaning in our lives, this  is a bright and shiny rebuttal.

I don't know that anyone but Jimmy Stewart could play the nice guy who always does the right thing and inject that character with the darkness necessary to turn a schmaltzy premise into a profound statement of each man's place in his world. A great supporting cast (including Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, Henry Travers and Beulah Bondi) led by a brilliant director. Nicely remastered print.

41667,5,0782010792,"At its center, the film works because we all have wondered what would the world be like if we were never born. Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level.... This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.",1221177600,3,2463,4.716937354988399
41668,5,0782010792,"`It's a Wonderful Life' is one of those movies that could easily have fallen victim to its own popularity.  Rendered as one of the greatest American films, `It's a Wonderful Life' has a lot to live up to, and with all that hype comes, at times, major disappointment.  The nice thing about `It's a Wonderful Life' is that it actually lives up to the hype, and then some.  Not only is it one of the most heartwarming films I've ever had the privilege of seeing (sure, it may not seem it at times, but just wait) but it is also one of the smartest and most intelligent films to come along.

The film tells the story of George Bailey, your typical `nice' guy with big dreams that finds himself shortchanged by everyday happenstance until he's married with children, still living in the same small town he wanted so badly to escape from and working a job he never anticipated or desired.  It's not that George is unhappy it's just that he is less than satisfied.  As events unfold within his life that press firmly upon him to where he starts to feel trapped George contemplates the unfathomable.

Suicide.

The film somewhat starts at this point; with an angel being sent down to save George from himself in an attempt to gain his wings.  What follows is a beautiful look at a life lived to the full despite not being lived as fully as one would have hoped, and then we get a glimpse at what life would have been like had George never lived at all, and while the results are a tad on the extreme side they help us to appreciate that each and everyone of us play a large part in the lives of everyone we touch.  It's a beautiful and sincere message that resonates with everyone and touches every soul.

If you walk away from `It's a Wonderful Life' unmoved then you must have ice in your veins.

Some pass this movie over expecting it to be nothing more than a Christmas film, but Christmas is the smallest part of this film.  Yes, it is used around the holidays to fill the heart with gladness and express the wonderment of children and family and friends and blessings but those emotions and that message is much farther reaching than a single yearly event.

The film is bolstered along by some beautiful performances, especially from James Stewart (who has never been one of my favorite actors).  He delivers such a powerfully moving and real portrayal of a man who doesn't fully understand all that he has until he is faced with the prospect of never having it at all.  His transformation from a man down and out and unsatisfied to a man striving to retain all that he fears he has lost is amazing and utterly convincing.  This is the type of performance that moves people to tears.  I was also impressed with Lionel Barrymore who portrays Henry F. Potter (the Scrooge in this tale) with such devilish intrigue.  He is the perfect villain to Stewart's worn soul.  This is the type of villain you love to hate.

In the end I must urge everyone to watch this movie, not once, not twice but over and over again.  Don't limit yourself to that one time of year to enjoy this wonderful movie but indulge yourself with one of the most beautifully complete tales of love, life and the American dream ever made.",1221004800,2,3201,4.454545454545454
41669,5,0782010792,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  George Bailey is so real.  I have been that man.  A guy looking for the glitz and the glamour only to settle for small town life raising kids and going to work everyday.  He is never the richest in terms of money, but when it comes down to it you finally realize money is not all that matters.",1212364800,3,340,3.9558823529411766

41671,5,0782010792,"For many, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a staple to their holiday traditions.  With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday.  As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago.  It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers.  For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again.  As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; ""It's A Wonderful Life"" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business.  With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself.  I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams ""Merry Christmas"" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape.  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy.  The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place.  This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing - giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him - but also a glimpse of a world without small business

""It's A Wonderful Life"", the film itself, is beautifully crafted.  With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image.  Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls.  Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town.  Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave - and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own.  Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting.  Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism.  His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes.  When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him - we scream with him.  This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters - we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles - and they do.  One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.

Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received.  His enormous sets, the birth of a new ""snow"", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe.  What I enjoy about ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is that Capra tricks you by the end.  Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time.  One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film - since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets.  Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural.  Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.  This film teeters between drama and science fiction, while so many critics award this film the ""feel-good"" holiday movie during December; I find it a bit strange that perhaps this film lead to so many other science fiction movies of the same nature.  Perhaps the ""Cloverfield"" monster could be considered a Clarence to someone in New York City?  I may be stretching a bit, but what pulls me into this film time and time again is the fact that Clarence is not of Earth, yet George easily believes.  He listens, follows, and - with some resistance - does what Clarence orders.  This is a film without guns, without explosions, without the President getting on his red phone - but instead a film where a celestial being can visit someone without fear, anger, or confusion.  This is why I collect the ""Alf"" television series.

Overall, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home.  The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world.  Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values.  The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer - the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back.  Dreams are traded for jobs - communities are strengthened by friendships.  This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls.  The science fiction element to this film, yep - that is what I am considering it - comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout.  Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes?  Brilliant!  While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film.  Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever.  Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever.  It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.

Grade: ***** out of *****",1208822400,3,6525,4.722614840989399
41672,3,0782010792,"Although it didn't impress much at the time of it's release, this film probably more than most others, goes to show that eventually the cream always rises to the top.  It's just a charming, heart-warming film with a nice mix of comedy, drama, sadness, despair and joy which makes it difficult for any human being to not be touched emotionally in some way by this film.  The screenplay is very good, the casting excellent and James Stewart shows why he is considered to be among the greatest screen actors of all time.

The DVD though isn't all that much to shout about.  The Special Features are pretty decent with a very good documentary about the film hosted by Tom Bosley of ""Happy Days"" fame being the standout but it's placed on the the ""B"" side of this single disc.  Fortunately with the advent of Blu-ray and the much greater capacity such a format affords, we don't have to put up with this inconvenience any longer.  The sound quality is in the original mono format which has been THX mastered which makes it the best possible mono quality that you can find.  However, it would have been nice if they were to provided Dolby or otherwise 5.1 Surround Sound Options as well.  The picture quality has been restored but not very well as visual imperfections exist throughout the film suggesting either a poorly preserved master or that the restoration job wasn't the best.

I note at the time of writing that a Blu-Ray version is out there and I wonder if they made any more audio and visual restorations and if so, I will certainly put it on my list of Blu-Ray titles to get in the future.  If you are not too picky about the ""dirtiness"" of the picture quality, this DVD is certainly one for your collection that bears the test of repeated viewing and enjoyment.

Jimmy Stewart is one (if not the best actor) of the best actors in history.  Along with the movie, ""Mr. Stewart Goes to Washington"", this movie are his best works.

41685,5,0782010792,"For those who have acquired copies of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" before, the question might be: What do you need with another copy?  Well, the answer is that the color and details in this colorized version are almost perfect and far more impressive than the black-and-white copy. That's even though the re-mastered B&W version of the movie is fine, too.  If Mary Bailey (played by Donna Reed) were to see the color version she would say, again: ""It's a miracle.""  Try as we could my wife and I couldn't find anything wrong with the colorization.  Details on human faces are incredible--shadows where there should be shadows, beard stubble on the despairing George Bailey (played by Jimmy Stewart), etc.  The only question we might have would be how Mary Bailey got her Hollywood sun tan living in Bedford Falls?  But we've wondered that before in the re-mastered, B&W version.  Other aspects in this rendering are just outstanding, too, like color posters of the South Pacific in the Baileys' honeymoon suite, colors of Ernie's taxicab, birds in the trees and on window ledges, colors of flowers, grass, trees, snow, women's dresses, men's ties, and on and on.  We'd venture to say that once you've seen the colorized version you'll never bother with the black-and-white copy again.  Special features include introductions and analyses by Tom Bosley and Frank Capra, Jr.  These were done in the early-1990's and even have a Frank Capra, Sr. interview shortly before his death.

I can't believe it took me fairly forever to purchase the DVD so I don't have to endure the commercial television version---cut up every few minutes and devastating the flow. I was curious if I would feel the same way about the colorized version as I do about the black and white. I was afraid the movie wouldn't translate as well. I needn't have worried. In color or in black and white the story is timeless, the emotion as emotional, the jokes and witicisms as funny and witty as ever.

As previously mentioned, the black & white version is no different than the 2006 release, and is the best B&W release you can find.  What sets this release apart is the colorized version.  I too am a film purist, and agree that B&W films are meant to be seen in B&W.  That being said, watching this movie in color is a real treat.  The scenes come alive, like never before.  Not only is this colorization better than the cheesy 80's attempt, but it allows you to see detail you never noticed before.  I don't think there is a bigger fan of It's A Wonderful Life than I am.  I've seen it literally hundreds of times.  And watching this colorized version, I saw items in the scenes that had always blended into the background when watching in B&W.  Take off your B&W-purist hat for a second, and give this colorized version a shot.  Even if you only watch it once, it's pretty neat!",1199232000,5,972,4.314917127071824

41733,5,0782010792,"In a conversation with a Chinese professor about ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" he surprised me by saying the Capra classic helped him better understand banks, capitalism, and oppression.  He had obviously focused on ""Mr. Potter.""

I replied that the film did provide some lessons in banking history -- how there were bank runs before there was federal deposit insurance, the differences between banks and what we now call credit unions, bank examining, and how credit and financial institutions could help make the dreams of a home or a business come true.

I said, though, that while banking gives the plot its frame, the film is not about banks.  It's rather a reflection on the worthwhile life.  That an individual can lead a worthy life in a small town as well as a large city.  That helping others is a mark of character.  That money has little to do with being ""the richest man in town.""

Right now, upwardly mobile young people in China want money. After so many decades of poverty, it's a natural social development that Chinese have focused on material things.  It's gone so far, though, that young upwardly mobile Chinese look down on their cousins and classmates who have stayed back in the small town where they grew up.  These young people may even look down on their schoolteachers, who gave them so much, because they don't make much money.

This means that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a film for Chinese as well as for Americans.

I was reluctant to watch the colorized version, but thought it would be fun just once and then watch the black and white from then on. When I was young I saw movies that Ted Turner had colorized with his ""crayons"", as Orson Welles called them, and was not to sure about this. Those movies were more or less a novelty of the 80's, something made fun of on ""The Simpsons"". As soon as the opening credits began though I became intrigued. This is an updated digital colorization version, not the horrible 1980's version. I was pleased with the results. I had never noticed the details in this movie, for example all the Coca-Cola signs in Gower's drug store, or the patterns on the wallpaper in the houses. The other reviewers made a good point, this movie looks like it was made in color during the 1940's. And for all the purist out there, it does include the best black and white version I have seen as well.

41740,5,0782010792,"The incomparable Jimmy Stewart stars as everyman George Bailey, an adventurous dreamer in his youth who feels repeatedly held-down and shackled by a small-town life that he cannot seem to escape throughout his adult years. A group of angels look down on George as he grows from boyhood to adulthood and experiences wonderful moments brought about by seeming defeats and sidetracks from his own hopes and dreams. When we finally catch up with George in modern-day (the late nineteen-forties), a sudden moment of desperation on Christmas Eve has driven him to thoughts of suicide. Convinced that the world would be better off if he'd never been born, the angel Clarence comes to George to show him otherwise by introducing him to a bleak world that never knew him and all the good that he has done.

Directed by Hollywood fave Frank Capra in 1946, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was forgotten soon after its initial release despite being nominated for multiple Oscars. However, an amazing thing happened when the film fell into public domain decades later. Repeat viewings on television gradually made the film a Christmas tradition and one of the most beloved films of all time. To this day, I personally consider it to be the best film ever made (though it is not my absolute favorite film or even favorite Christmas film, but definitely among them). ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has it all. So many moments of this movie are pure magic caught on film, sometimes even by accident! The performances are fantastic, the passion of the telephone scene is something you'll never forget, and the ending is sure to leave you in tears!

""It's a Wonderful Life"" has been released several times on DVD. I still have one of the earliest versions myself, if not THE earliest. Mine is the Silver Screen Classics release by Artisan, and it's quite satisfactory. The double-sided disc holds the film on side A and 3 extra features on side B. The features are the theatrical trailer, a Making Of documentary hosted by Tom Bosley, and ""A Personal Remembrance"" hosted by Frank Capra, Jr., which features interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Whichever version of the DVD you get though, be sure to get one, because this film is an annual must-watch at the very least! And, if you like this one, look for ""The Bishop's Wife"" (1947) and ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) if you want to have the three best classic Christmas films ever! Actually, I need to pick up those other two myself!",1198368000,2,2462,4.804245283018868
41741,5,0782010792,I was surprised to find both the colorised & black and white versions be sold together! I have loved this movie since I was a child and have watched every year since I was a teenager. The shopping & shipping for this DVD was easy as pie!!,1198195200,3,238,4.085106382978723
41742,4,0782010792,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was too mushy and sentimental to be taken seriously.

Now I am living in a shelter for the homeless, have ended a relationship of 10 years, and have the usual Christmastime hypersensitivity and memories of Christmas past that make my heart sore and tender.

This Christmas I really NEEDED ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  It nourished me.  Watching Jimmy Stewart--his beautiful, mobile face, his grace, his astounding acting ability, his ability to quintessentially embody what is best about America and make us feel we are all in it together--filled that hollow place.  The wonderful Clarence--his connection to G-d in` a casual and clumsy way, and yet his ability to bring off a glorious miracle: to grant a man an appreciation for being alive.  The miraculous rescue of George through the goodness and kindness of the people who know him.  George's heartfelt prayer on the bridge, when he has hit bottom.

The movie left me feeling connected, understood.

Frank Capra borrwed from Dickens's immortal A CHRISTMAS CAROL--an intervention by spirits into the life of mortal man to instruct and glorify--although, interestingly, Dickens did not venture into the realm of formalized religion.  The joy we share with George Bailey on his glorious return to the land of the living mirrors the unforgettable scene when Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Alistair Sim) realizes he is back in his own room, safe and sound.
That may be one of Frank Capra's themes:

It's a Frank Capra world, as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, I know life isn't really like this, but maybe it could be.

"". . . and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us!""

41744,5,0782010792,"That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant 1946 film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Arguably, one of the best films of all time, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the story of a fictional character named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart, 1908-1997) who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), dreamed of world travel and being an archetect, but the death of his father (Samuel S. Hinds, 1875-1948) forces him to remain in Bedford Falls in order to manage the Bailey Savings & Loan.  Though feeling trapped, he eventually marries Mary (Donna Reed, 1921-1986) and has four children.  Barely able to take care of his family, George is tempted by offer for a high-paying job by his chief rival,  the unscrupulous Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore, 1878-1954), but rejects it.  Finally, the pressure becomes too much for George when his absentminded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell, 1892-1962) loses money that was supposed to be deposited in Potter's bank and George is accused of embezzlement.  Feeling completely lost & helpless, George decides to plunge from a bridge into a dark & cold river; but suddenly, someone else falls in and George instinctively jumps in to save the other man's life.  The other man, however, is no man at all; but a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers, 1874-1965) sent to save George.  Not believing that Clarence is an angel, George wishes that he had never been born and Clarence grants him his wish.  When George returns to Bedford Falls, what he finds is the unseemly town of Pottersville: filled with nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  Further, no one knows George anymore.  Horrified, George desperately attempts to find Mary, his children and his mother; but what he finds only gets George into trouble with the people who had once known him including his two dearest friends: the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen, 1905-1985) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond, 1903-1960).  Will George get his life back, along with his wife, children & friends?  You'll just have to watch (if you haven't already) this classic film to find out.

With a brilliant story, wonderful direction thanks to Frank Capra (1897-1991) and superb acting, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" remains one of the most loved & watched films of the last 60 years.  The filmed earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor and Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Other memorable characters include George's mother (Beulah Bondi, 1888-1981), Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner, 1875-1958), George's daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes), George's brother Harry (Todd Karns, 1921-2000) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame, 1923-1981).  Overall, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" gets a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Though originally filmed in black and white, the film was colorized several years ago. While some don't approve of the colorization of older films, it's nice to see this DVD package offering both the original black & white version, as well as the colorized version for people to watch.",1198108800,4,3159,5.065637065637065

41751,5,0782010792,"A man named George Bailey (a superb James Stewart) lives in a small town called Bedford Falls. He contemplates happy times and travelling with his love Mary (Donna Reed). But on Chrsitmas Eve, because of intense frustration and an impending scandal - he conemplates suicide. He is visited by an angel named Clarence (a lovely performance by Henry Travers) who shows him what the world will be like if he had never been born. It is at this point that the film becomes very dark (especially given what has gone before), yet the underlying message is simple and uplifting - ""no one is a failure who has friends"". George Bailey was a completely selfless man, who thought himself a failure, and yet didn't realise he was so loved by his friends and neighbours.

Now I'm not used to seeing older US films like this but its' still a lovely film, maybe even inspiring Simpsons jokes (some plot elements are taken off in the episode ""When Flanders Failed"", and the horrible rich businessman Henry Potter played by Lionel Barrymore, is like Mr. Burns in a way). Some ideas may be taken from A Chrsitmas Carol as well.

Throughout the film George is such a nice, honest, friendly guy, who will help all his friends out. This is shown in the scene where he gives his honeymoon money away to help them until the bank opens. Its' a very close knit community where everyone knows everyone else.

Yet, the last part in which we see Bedford Falls is now called ""Pottersvile"" after the Scrooge-like Mr. Potter is genuinely disturbing and shows Bailey's descent into sadness, anger and despair when no-one, not even his mother, knows him.
Everything is different and the whole town has a ""bad"" air.

But it is overall a  beautiful film that is so warm and touching, and made me feel happy and sad all at once - an American classic.",1196380800,3,1812,4.614906832298137
41752,5,0782010792,"One of the most heartwarming and uplifting films ever created, Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life perfectly captures the human spirit through faith, love and second chances, and beautifully weaves an unforgettable tale. Essentially a twist on Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", the characters are richly developed and each scene is elegantly directed. Jimmy Stewart displays the purest of human emotions with unbeatable acting, as does the superlative supporting cast including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.

In Bedford Falls, George Bailey (James Stewart) contemplates suicide. Through the prayers of countless friends, an angel named Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to help George in his plight. From here the story backtracks with a narration by Joseph, the head angel, to fill in the details of Bailey's life. As a young boy he saves his brother Harry from drowning, and later after the untimely death of his father, stays in Bedford Falls to help run the Business and Loan Company, started by his father and business partner, Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), years ago. George desperately wants to leave the small town that he's been cooped up in his whole life, but continually finds himself staying, first to save the business, then to allow his younger brother to go off to college, and finally to wed childhood sweetheart Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). When the conniving Mr. Potter, the richest man in town, who has been trying to buy out the Business and Loan Company his entire life, discovers a banking error that could destroy the fledgling company, George becomes impetuous and is convinced he's worth more dead than alive. ""Is he sick?"" asks the angel Clarence. ""No, worse"", responds Joseph. ""He's discouraged"".

Jimmy Stewart turns in a tour de force of Christmas spirit, hope and anguish, and he lights up the screen like few others. His acting is flawless and his emotions utterly genuine. Donna Reed is also exceptional as Mary, the girl who is madly in love with George and content with waiting until he realizes his feelings are reciprocal. It is a timeless romance and an essential part of this film which is often overlooked by the comparisons to Scrooge's revelations in ""A Christmas Carol"". The love story is prominent and heartfelt, and while noticeably characterized by the 40's strict sense of decent relationships, an inspiring image that never fades. Lionel Barrymore plays Mr. Potter, the ""Grinch"" character who never does receive proper requital, although we are content knowing he never rises above the changeless miserable miser figure he holds throughout the film. He hates everyone who has anything he doesn't have - although money has never been one of those things.

And then there's Clarence, the simple angel who is anxious to receive his wings by helping Bailey realize the value of God's greatest gift. Henry Travers portrays Clarence with wonderfully elementary honesty and presents humorous situations of disbelief for George, which quickly turns to panic at the insistence and demonstration of Clarence's guardian angel abilities. Clarence, while only appearing at the very end of the film, is a major player, giving George the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he were never born. George spends a great deal of time struggling with disbelief at Pottersville, so renamed because of his absence in preventing Potter from taking over the town. His friends and family don't recognize him, and he is reduced to tears at all of the now indifferent lives he didn't know he had touched. As Clarence points out, it's remarkable to see how many people are influenced by a single individual.

Written, produced and directed by the legendary Frank Capra, It's A Wonderful Life created countless poignant and memorable moments and themes that would later be referenced and remembered in future filmmaking. George wants to do big and important things away from Bedford Falls, realizing only at the conclusion how important it was for him not to accomplish those goals. The broken down Waldorf hotel becomes the home of George and Mary's dreams and even the location for the perfect honeymoon, one that the newlyweds missed out on initially, and George shouting from the top of the very bridge he nearly leapt from: ""I want to live again!"" In the end, George is the richest man in town, measured not by his wealth, but by his friends.

41753,4,0782010792,"First: Most importantly, there is only one thing new to this edition: the colorized version on Disc 2. Which, if you're open to colorization, is pretty amazing. I, for one, am on the fence about it. I love old B&W films, and It's a Wonderful Life looks beautiful in B&W, but it's nice to have this color version to show my kids before they have to be in their twenties to appreciate a B&W film.

Anyways, back to this 4th (?) DVD edition of the movie, and 2nd by Paramount. If you didn't upgrade to last year's 60th Edition from Paramount and still own one of the older (Silver Screen or other) copies, this would be the one to upgrade. I did a side by side comparison of my Silver Screen DVD to this one, and the new black and white transfer is a massive improvement; the difference is easily noticeable.

Or, you can wait until Paramount decides to re-release it again, which they most definitely will. Only question is, when? IMO, this was the DVD they wanted to release for the 60th anniversary, but maybe the colorization wasn't finished and so they rushed out a branded ""60th Anniversary Edition"" just to cash in. That's 100% speculation, but it sounds pretty logical, doesn't it?",1194998400,5,1186,4.537383177570093
41754,4,0782010792,"Just when I thought this release would finally give this classic movie the treatment it deserved, I was surprisingly suprised lastnight to come home, pop in the black and white disc and see that it is the exact same release as last year's 60th anniversary edition. For those who have complained about the 60th anniversary edition in the past, you may not be surprised to hear that Paramount has not gotten rid of that annoying Queen Latifa trailer when you first pop the DVD in. It's the exact disc in all actuallity. They just added a bonus disc, the colorized version, with no addition bonus features.

Now, I was very upset with this news. I was hoping there would finally be a DVD to accomidate the classic film appropriately and without commercialism to other Paramount movies and products. However, that day still has not come.

With my dissapointment with the packaging of this film, I still give the overall rating four stars based on the brilliance and beautifully done colorization on disc two. They definately spent some time and consideration in this new process as even the pictures of individuals around the living room and offices remain in black and white as they would have in real life. They get real detailed about what they're doing and do such a fine job of it, that at times (not all the time though) it appears as though the film was actually filmed in color. It's really something to see if you get your hands on it.",1194912000,26,1440,4.643137254901961
41755,5,0782010792,"I have watched this movie many times, and each time it makes me cry and feel overwhelmed with emotion.  This amazes me, because it is so sentimental and in many ways contrived, at least as we see it through our jaded modern eyes.  Sure, it was made for a simpler time, but there is no doubt that it taps into universal human truths and hopes.

Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a good and talented man who allows his sense of responsibility to guide his life, which costs him hugely in his sense of frustration and thwarted ambition.  You see it in him as a child, particularly the scene in the drug store, where he saves more than one life.  (That scene chokes me up every time I see it.  There is such struggle and caring in it, such courage as he sticks to his decision.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.)  Of course, he has a terrible crisis that is resolved, with a renewed sense of life.

Donna Reed is also wonderful as his wife, a simple woman who loves him in the way we would all hope to be loved in marriage.  Indeed, she embodies an ideal and yet is so believable that it makes me introspect on my own marriage.  And Barrymore!  The perfect capitalist ogre.

Like many, I watch this every Christmas season and feel awe at the power of a perfectly crafted hollywood story.  While we get down on hollywood formulas, there are times when it works as well as one could hope.  That is this film, one of the finest ever made.

For one thing: Don't we watch movies to be entertained, to make believe? For those who say this movie bombed, and that noone liked it upon its initial release, well yes that is true. But as they say 'sometimes you don't get it, until you get it.' This film is honest if nothing else. About one man who gives, and gets nothing in return. He wants glory, but doesn't realize that he is seen as glorious by those who know him best. He has a beautiful wife, well behaved kids, and most of all he has integrity. He realizes that if he never existed that he never would have saved his own brother's life. He wouldn't have married his beautiful wife, who actually loved him as a child (remember what she whispers in his ear?)

41771,5,0782010792,"In Frank Capra's film imagination and ideal sentimental outlook of post WW2 America, Bedford Falls is the small town American dream. Looking back as a child this world was the ""real"" America or at least the way we all thought and felt it should be.

I remember seeing this film at the young age of six or seven, in my pyjamas sprawled in front of the black and white TV set with my two younger sisters, though it was in the middle of July, before it became a ""Christmas Tradition"", the entire family sat attentive, watching George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grow and become something of the true ""good"" man: sensitive, loving, caring and loyal.

Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) is simply stunning and so innocent, beautiful and loved George with all her heart.

George and Mary's wedding night is so Irish, small town, simple and lovely to watch as they come to terms with that broken-down ""house"" which had become a symbol of their respective dreams. Even as a small child, the old guy outside their window on their wedding night, singing lyrics of love felt to me to be true. We loved these two people because they were really in love and at bottom, we all want that love.

Love becomes reality when the children arrive and making a living, a family, is important.

George Bailey had always dreams of travelling the world. Even to the end, he kept old ""tourist"" pamphlets and books of far away places but something, people and basic life obligations always somehow prevented that dream.

The villain of the film is Mr. Potter, (Lionel Barrymore) a Dickensian-like character, a true Capitalist without heart, pushed hard to turn Bedford Falls into a ""Las Vegas"", though it was little George Bailey, caring and deeply aware of the ""worker"" the ""little man"" who staved the ugly and evil Mr. Potter off from attaining his selfish goals.

How this turn in the plot occurs, however, is pure fantasy, because as George Bailey stresses, having lost money ( by the stupidity of Uncle Billy) owed to the tyrant, is about to do a willing free-fall into the river, Clarence, an apprentice angel, prevents George from his self-destructive action, and talks Bailey into trying life again. The way the angel does this is true wisdom combined with loving magic.

How would life be if you had never been born?

Clarence the bumbling angel takes George through Bedford as though he never existed. George discovers that his life did have an affect on the town and the many lives he would have come in contact with. In a few words, without George, Bedford did indeed become a ""Las Vegas"" and his friends, particularly Mary, were lost.

George comes back to reality and the entire community give back to George who has done so much for them, (the money Uncle Billy had lost) on Christmas Eve.

A little bell rings which signifies an angel has moved up and finally attained their ""wings"". As an angel, Clarence, has turned a good man from self destruction, and now can move upward...and fly.

This Frank Capra film written by Philip Van Doren Stern (story) and Francis Goodrich, et al., has somehow taught us that giving is one of the truest virtues of them all.

A splendid film.",1185494400,,3155,4.693840579710145

Reed and Barrymore give exceptional performances, but Stewart, in one of his all-time great roles (a personal favorite), is the dynamic, all-too-human force holding it all together. Revived in the '70s after languishing in copyright limbo, ""Life"" is nostalgic and achingly sentimental, but doesn't shrink from portraying the dark side of American life.

41775,5,0782010792,"What would the Christmas holiday season be like without Frank Capra's 1946 classic, It's A Wonderful Life? For millions around the world, watching this inspiring, heartwarming movie starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is as much a part of the Christmas celebration as putting cookies and milk out for Santa Claus, caroling, drinking eggnog, or trimming the tree.

Of the hundreds of movies I've seen during the forty-one years I've lived so far, there isn't one I can think of that is so quintessentially American as It's A Wonderful Life. Part comedy, part melodrama, and part supernatural fantasy, the film recounts the life of an apparently ordinary guy, George Bailey, who keeps getting the short end of the stick when it comes to realizing his extraordinary dreams and plans for the future.

However, I've learned first-hand that professing my love for this film is sure to provoke arguments with those who accept the ethics of objectivism (the philosophy of Ayn Rand). On its face, the message of the film appears to endorse self-sacrifice for the good of others. But I disagree with that interpretation. In fact, I think that the choices made by George Bailey during his life were truly wonderful, embodying a full and proper conception of personal, long-term self-interest, but without preaching egotism.

The movie opens to the voices of George's loved ones, family and friends who are sending up prayers to God to take care of and watch out for George, who's fallen on the hardest of hard times on Christmas Eve. George's bad luck doesn't look like it's about to change when he is assigned a guardian angel (""second class"") named Clarence, a benevolent bumbler who hasn't even ""earned his wings.""  We then learn what has brought George Bailey to the brink of tragedy as director Capra tells the man's life story in a long flashback that makes up most of the picture.

Ever since boyhood, George Bailey has been there for others. When he was twelve, he rescued his brother, Harry, from drowning in a pond after he had crashed through the ice while sledding. Later, working as a drugstore delivery boy, he prevented his distraught, drunken boss from accidentally dispensing poison in prescription capsules.

As he grows up, George dreams of bigger things than can be found in the confines of his small town: seeing Europe, becoming a civil engineer. About to head off to tramp through Europe before going to college, he shares with his girlfriend, Mary (Donna Reed), his secret aspirations:

""Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day, and next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world! I'm gonna build things: I'm gonna build airfields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high! I'm gonna build bridges a mile long!""

 But at every crucial turn in his life, George's grandiose dreams are thwarted by the responsibilities of everyday life. As he's about to set sail, he learns that his father had a fatal stroke. After the funeral, George stays in Bedford Falls to run the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan, the family business that his father and Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) had built up, rather than allow it to slip into the grasp of the family's avaricious nemesis, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is the town's Scrooge-like magnate, a corrupt, power-lusting slumlord who owns most of the key businesses in Bedford Falls. George puts his dreams on hold while he manages the business--and while he watches his younger brother, Harry, go off to college instead.

Then, rather than jump at the opportunity to invest in the promising plastics industry, George instead goes after his real love, Mary, finally proposing to her. One of the movie's pivotal scenes occurs on the day of their marriage. Just as they are about to embark on their European honeymoon, fate again steps in: their wedding date is ""Black Tuesday,"" October 29, 1929--the day of the stock market crash. En route to the train station, George and Mary see the people of Bedford Falls running toward the building and loan. George rushes over to find that Uncle Billy has panicked and shut the doors to depositors, having disbursed all the money on hand. Worse, Mr. Potter telephones and tells George that he will ""help"" bail out the building and loan by offering its members fifty cents on the dollar for every share.

While everyone is losing his head, George keeps his cool, despite the throng of terrified customers demanding their money. George staves off the building and loan's collapse not by whining to the crowd to bail him out, but by appealing to their long-term self-interest: by asking them not to sell out their future to Potter.

""You're thinking about this place all wrong, as if I have the money back in the safe. The money's not here. Well, your money's in Joe's house, that's right next to yours. And the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Maitlin's house and a hundred others. You're lending them the money to build, and then they're going to pay it back to you as best they can....Now, listen to me, I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets a hold of this building and loan, there will never be another decent house built in this town.... Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten, have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack? Here, Ed, remember last year, when things weren't going so well, you couldn't make your payments? Well, you didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would've let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Potter isn't selling, he's buying! And why? Because we're panicking and he's not.... Now, we can get through this thing all right, we've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.""

 I once argued with an Objectivist about that scene, maintaining that George and Mary did the right thing by using their $2,000 honeymoon nest egg to help their depositors weather the storm. But all my friend could see in that scene--indeed, in the whole movie--was altruism. ""One of the very first lines in that movie,"" he told me, ""is `he never thinks of himself'!""

But was that true? Consider what would have happened had George and Mary gone on their honeymoon instead of bailing out their building and loan. Yes, they would have had an enjoyable, relaxing couple of months in Europe; but what would they have come home to? The business that George's father had sweat blood to create and keep afloat would have gone bankrupt. Not only would George and Mary have had no source of income, but their depositors--family, friends, loved ones--would have seen their life savings evaporate. The housing development George had built would have fallen into Potter's hands.

For George, the choice was between short-term pleasure and long-term priorities. Did he choose irrationally?
What makes It's A Wonderful Life work so well is that we get to see a different, less readily apparent kind of heroism in George Bailey. Sure, it's easy to notice and admire the swashbuckling valor of a Scarlet Pimpernel or the ""damn the torpedoes"" military bravery of a John Wayne. But the real world doesn't always present opportunities for obvious and flamboyant heroism. More often than not, it presents instead tough value choices that reveal an individual's true priorities--and his true character.

It's A Wonderful Life is a testament to the power of free will when the going gets tough. In every instance when George faces adversities, he could easily make the easy choice, opting for the fleeting promise of instant gratification. But instead, he consistently makes the harder decision to delay immediate pleasure in order to achieve or preserve his larger, lasting, most profound values.

 Today, most people watching the scenes in the building and loan's offices probably cannot quite grasp the bold, life-changing message on the banner that hangs there: ""Own Your Own Home."" But I remember as a kid talking with my father about what it was like for him growing up in a Depression-era coal mining town in West Virginia. ""You had to have at least a fifty percent down payment to buy a home in those days,"" he told me. ""If you were poor, you had to rent."" More than any other movie I've seen, It's A Wonderful Life makes real the enormous benefits of the credit revolution, a tribute to ""man's faith in man.""

To Frank Capra, it was men like George Bailey who helped lift the working class into the middle class. Capra considered this film his personal favorite, and put into it a lot of his own experiences as a first-generation immigrant from Sicily. It's A Wonderful Life is his love letter to the American Dream.

 What makes the movie so credible, and Jimmy Stewart so believable as George Bailey, is that he and Capra had both faced those tough choices just months before it was shot. It's A Wonderful Life was the first movie they worked on after World War II. Shortly after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Stewart joined the U.S. Army Air Force and served as a decorated bomber pilot. Capra spent most of the war shooting the Why We Fight series of propaganda films that proved so crucial to the Allied war effort. Both men could easily have avoided service: Capra was too old when the war began, and Stewart flunked his first physical, being too thin for service. But they put aside the glamorous lifestyle and money Hollywood afforded them for the higher purpose of defending America and freedom. I only wish that such values were held in higher esteem by Americans now, in supporting the war effort against the terrorist threat. Today, we seem less eager to make the kind of hard choices that the men and women of Capra's and Stewart's generation did.

The movie's famous climax takes place on Christmas Eve. Bedford Falls awaits the return of its hometown hero--George's brother, Harry Bailey (Todd Karns). As a Navy fighter pilot, Harry saved a transport ship full of American troops by shooting down a Japanese torpedo bomber. However, a few hours before his arrival back home, the building and loan comes up short $8,000. Uncle Billy has absent-mindedly mislaid the money, and now, with the bank examiner and police breathing down his neck, the distraught George sees his entire life coming apart. After fighting Potter all his life, he's reduced to pleading before him, begging to borrow the cash to rescue the building and loan. His only collateral is $500 equity in a life insurance policy. The smirking Potter mocks him, saying, ""Why, George Bailey, you're worth more dead than alive!""

George soon finds himself standing alone in the blustery snow atop a bridge, weeping in drunken desperation, thinking about jumping into the icy rapids below.

At that very moment, guardian angel Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) leaps into the river himself, giving George the opportunity to let his inherent goodness emerge once more. George rescues Clarence, then slowly learns the incredible truth: that the old man is an angel sent to protect him.

But still believing that his life has been a failure, he informs the eccentric Clarence that he's wasting his time. ""I wish I'd never been born,"" George mumbles bitterly.

 The words inspire Clarence to grant George his wish. In the film's closing moments, he gives the man a shocking tour of what Bedford Falls would have been like if George Bailey had never existed.

The housing subdivision that George envisioned is never built; it becomes ""Potter's Field,"" a graveyard for paupers. The wife of his cabbie friend, Ernie (Frank Faylen), leaves him because Ernie wasted his money paying rent for one of Potter's tenements, instead of investing in his own home. Deprived of the chance to lead a productive life with the building and loan, eccentric Uncle Billy is eventually committed to an insane asylum. George's beloved Mary remains a spinster; their children are never born. And Bedford Falls itself--a small, thriving American community right out of a Norman Rockwell illustration--deteriorates into ""Pottersville,"" a sleazy town full of bars, strip joints, and pawn shops.

Most devastating to George, Clarence leads him to his brother Harry's gravestone in Potter's Field.

 ""You're brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice, and drowned at the age of nine,"" he informs George.
 ""That's a lie!"" George protests. ""Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport!""
 ""Every man on that transport died,"" Clarence corrects him. ""Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.... You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?""
 ""You have been given a great gift,"" Clarence adds. ""A chance to see what the world would be like without you.""

As I do every Christmas, this year I'll again be watching It's A Wonderful Life with my family. I'll once more share with my loved ones Frank Capra's timeless tale of a man who always remained loyal to his highest and dearest values, and who ennobled the lives of everyone he touched through his common sense, farsighted thinking, and uncommon integrity.

To those who might dismiss George's story as not the stuff of epic heroism, I can only repeat the director's own words. Decades after It's a Wonderful Life first appeared, Frank Capra said: ""The importance of the individual is the theme that it tells. That no man is a failure, that every man has something to do with his life. If he's born, he's born to do something.""

He added: ""To some of us, all that meets the eye is larger than life, including life itself. Who can match the wonder of it?""",1180828800,6,13746,4.848549488054608

41779,5,0782010792,"1947's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has rightly been a Christmas favorite for years.  Frank Capra's classic movie carries the simple but powerful message that everyone can be a hero in their own lives, and no one is poor who has friends.

The story features James Stewart as George Bailey, a banker in the small town of Bedford Falls.  Facing financial ruin on Christmas Eve, he comtemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, gives him an opportunity to see his life as it might have been without him.  George, although hardworking, good-hearted, happily married, and modestly successful, has unluckily never had the opportunity to pursue bigger dreams outside Bedford Falls.  In the disturbingly dark alternate version of his life, we discover that George had a postive impact on a lot of people over the years, and without him, those lives went badly wrong.  In the end, George is offered the chance to return to his life as he has lived it, and discovers the true value of friendship.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" features an exceptionally solid cast and crisp black and white cinematography.  Frank Capra's excellent direction carries us through the emotional gauntlet of George Bailey's painful voyage of discovery about the truth of his life. The feel-good ending will make the viewer appreciate his or her own Christmas as the annual small miracle it is.

This movie is highly recommended as a family Christmas movie on a par with the better versions of Dicken's ""Christmas Carol.""",1180224000,,1485,5.024489795918368

41783,5,0782010792,"This holiday classic is seen by millions of people each December, and for good reason. Its message, similar to A Christmas Carol, is that a good look at your past deeds will help to put your current world into context. In Scrooge's case, it was his bad past that helps him to create a better future. In this Capra tale, it is the realization that the main character has done a lot of good in the past - and that it really has made a big difference in peoples' lives.

I won't give away a lot of plot details here. If you're like most people, you've probably seen this several times over the years and appreciated the nuanced layers of meaning offered by the storyline. If you haven't seen this yet, then most definitely rent or buy it for a viewing, without ""knowing what's coming"".

You can say the movie is a bit sappy - but there are times we can all appreciate a bit of sappiness in order to help a message ""go down"" more smoothly. We've all had times in our life that we feel frustrated, that maybe we aren't making a difference. This movie helps to show that the feelings are common ones - and that usually they are not warranted at all. The movie also helps to demonstrate that good deeds are always remembered, and that people really appreciate even the little ones.

A good movie for watching with family and talking about.",1178928000,,1332,4.384615384615385

After a slight misstep by his bumbling Uncle Billy, George Bailey's ""Building and Loan"" comes up short 8,000 dollars. In a moment of desperation and depression, George Bailey considers throwing away God's greatest gift, his own life. Instead, Clarence -- an angel wishing to get his wings -- intervenes, hoping the good deed of saving George Bailey will cause a bell to ring...

Why? Because ""every time a bell rings... an angel gets his wings.""

Instead of helping George take his own life, Clarence guides George through a ""Christmas Carol"" type story, where George is given a chance to see what the world would be like without him in it.

Throw a pebble into a pond and the ripple effects are seen for quite some time. They grow and grown, covering more area, spreading farther and wider until they eventually reach the ends of the pond, lake, or ocean in which they sprang. In this tale, George Bailey gets a first-hand glimpse at exactly how far and wide the ripple effect of his own existence has reached.

James Stewart is absolutely ""wonderful"" in his performance as George Bailey - his dialogue, humor and approach to the role should be taught in all acting schools. Unfortunately, judging by most of today's actors and movies - it is not.

Donna Reed plays his wife and also delivers a magnificent performance. It is absolutely amazing (and well deserved) that their work is still being enjoyed worldwide - some SIX DECADES after this film's initial release!

Frank Capra has to be mentioned in any review of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" - his cinematic direction and vision in this touching film is unmatched - even today.

By the end of this story I was completely moved, a changed person. That was the best Christmas I have ever had, though I was homeless and pennyless I discovered something eternal that guided me onward. I will always cherish that experience.

You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly.

41829,5,0782010792,"I've seen this movie a million times. When I saw the movie this time, what struck me was how radical the movie is. Rather than a ""feelgood movie"", the movie is a passionate advocate of the kind of radical communitarian populism that fueled many progressives during the Depression era. Perhaps this radicalism, which was passe by 1946, was the reason the movie was unpopular when it was released.

Plot elements make this abundantly clear. Mr. Potter, a figure straight from Enron or the Jack Welch ""lean and mean"" school of capitalism, is the embodiment of monetary values. George Bailey, on the other hand, is the embodiment of communitarian values where personal profit takes a back seat to the welfare of every member of the community. Dystopic Pottersville is presented as the inevitable result of Potter's denial of communitarian values, a place where alienation and anomie reign supreme. Bedford Falls is a communitarian utopia where all walks of life unite for the good of all and for the least among them. Capitalism is transformed from Potteresque exploitation to innovative entrepreneurialism where a good idea (the plastics factory) both enriches its owners and contributes to the good of the community.

I think this political message was strong and intentional and contributed to the film's unpopularity when it came out. Not until it was recast as a ""feelgood movie"" did it become a beloved classic, with its message buried in a ton of schmaltzy misinterpretation. Don't let the film's sentimentality (which I love) or the unfortunate racial and sexual stereotypes of its era  blind you to the import of its true message -- a message that is even more germane now than it was in 1946.",1167091200,8,1698,4.992932862190813
41830,5,0782010792,"This is the umpteeth review of the Christmas movie whose existence has been acknowledged through yearly TV airings and sitcom parodies.  In a world that grows increasingly hostile and bitter, it's good to know that the film's message of the values of love, friendship, and self-worth still sticks.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" follows the trials of George Bailey (played by a superb James Stewart).  He's got the brains, he's got the talent, and he's itching to leave his hometown and conquer the world.  But circumstance-or fate, rather-always gets in George's way.  While everyone else takes off and makes it big, George is stuck working at Bailey Buildings & Loan, defending his community against greedy miser Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).  And to meet this end, George turns down all outside opportunities.  Though he marries longtime friend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and starts a family, he still craves his friends' success.  Now on the verge of scandal and ruin, George's frustration takes its toll, and he considers taking his own life.  Eventually, guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) comes along and gives George a rare gift-a chance to see what the world would be like without him.

George's life of self-sacrifice seems to imply that good will toward men may not be the best philosophy, a theme that has earned the film its fair share of disdain.  The tone may remind viewers of Ursula LeGuin's ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,"" or ""Death of a Salesman.""  But director Frank Capra and his cast helped to raise the mood from dispair to happiness slowly but flawlessly, as George soon realizes his worth to the world and to his loved ones, as well as his love for both.  The emotion and drama caught in the movie makes it the one to watch on this and future holiday seasons.

It used to be that I could last until the bell rang, but as more and more of those near and dear to me depart this earth, I realize more the value of those who remain. So then I started breaking down when the bushel basket of money came in, and this year, when George/Jimmy finds himself back on the Bridge, alive and himself.  May we all live long enough to regress to the opening credits!

This is a film rich with meaning and love. It is one of the few that I heartily recommend year after year.

My wife and I have accumulated 27 years of public school teaching between us and we feel this is one movie we would wish that all of our students as well as loved ones experience at least once a year.

41835,5,0782010792,"I saw ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the first time as an adult recently, you know that sappy flop that just happens to be one of the most watched Christmas movies after SIXTY YEARS? What I saw was not what I remembered seeing. I replayed the scenes that seemed to have such a magical effect on me, most of them also just happened to have Mary Hatch/Bailey in them. I replayed them in slow motion and stepped through some of them frame by frame. What I began to realize caused me to wonder. Almost all of the really special things I felt about this movie had to do with Donna Reed. Yes Jimmy Stewart was good, but it was only against the backdrop of Donna Reed's Mary that I felt he became great in this role.

I saw the details and subleties of a performance that felt so real that if I saw some scenes a thousand times I would still be torn up by her in them. I find that I have become a bit of an apologist for the movie as a whole, and her in particular. I am working on a guide, of sorts, that deals with certain aspects of the plot and character development that I feel are commonly overlooked by the casual viewer. All I can say is this: If you watch it-pay deliberate attention to her face and especially her eyes. And, watch her scenes several times over so you can see the details. Near the end of the ""Parlor"" scene there are several seconds of her that I find endearingly spicy. The very last frame before the camera cuts to her mother shows a change in her expression I wish I could have seen all of. I wish Capra had allowed us to see this scene develop from their point of view all the way through. At least from the point where sweet, innocent Mary has just told her disapproving mother that a depressed and irritable George is ""...making violent love to me, mother!""

I would have much rather seen the two of them and merely heard her mother's reply.

The ""telephone"" scene is the best emotional interaction I guess I have ever seen on film. If it isn't clear why, I'll send you a copy of what I have so far.

I realize that I had never really noticed Donna Reed before, other than that she was different in this from what I'd heard about her. My dad didn't watch the Donna Reed show, so it was never on. I never really noticed her in anything else, except maybe for glimpses of the TV show.  After watching the young Miss Reed closely in It's a Wonderful Life I find it hard to believe that she was mostly offered bland/dull/B-movie, squeaky clean roles afterward. I can't imagine that no one could have seen the things I now see in this movie, and in Donna Reed's character Mary Hatch. She is just such a foxy lady in this-even given the standards of the day. Her eyes and facial expressions show a fun, playful spirit that she seems to be well aware is a contradiction to the prim and proper front Mary presents to the world. Although she won her Academy Award for the role of Alma in  ""From Here to Eternity"", as for steamy attractiveness, Alma can't hold a candle to Mary Hatch!",1166313600,4,2997,4.258347978910369

This was a VHS, it's not out on DVD, and I doubt it will ever be made available. Colorized movies are a specialty market, and it seems they are disappearing quickly.

41837,3,0782010792,"Why hate this movie?

Well, a lot of the values it trumpets are dated, to say the least.  In Bedford Falls (the ""good"" universe) women and blacks are only around to work for the white men.  We're not supposed to mind that a 12 year old is left unsupervised to watch a store, or that the adult George drives drunk, or that he lets Potter refer to his friends as ""a bunch of garlic eaters,"" and we're supposed to think it's cute and funny that an 18 year old smacks the rear end of his adult (black and female) servant.  And then there are some values that no one seems to latch on to. (You'd think all the people who love ""Wonderful Life"" would have noticed that the wedding was small and inexpensive and copied it.  You don't hear about people doing that, though.)

In the ""bad"" universe of Pottersville, blacks can be musicians and women can have careers. (And why does Mary never getting married lead to an almost unibrow?)

But the themes that one life can be important, that the love of family is precious, that friends can BE family, get me every time.

BTW, the French translation on the DVD is quite good, with the actors doing the dubbing working hard to sound like the characters and not just people reading.",1165363200,11,1217,4.401785714285714

41842,4,0782010792,"First, the good news; yes, the newest edition of this Yule tide classic has been given an amazing restoration, and nicely blows the socks off of the older Republic DVD.

I've never seen this, or pretty much any picture for that matter, look so crisp and clean, with no dust specs, scratches or artefacts to be had at all.

But, unfortunately, the amazing picture quality comes with a rather annoying price, as there are 4 very loud audio pops, to be heard coming from the left hand speaker, through out the picture at the:

1. 7 minutes and 43 second mark

2. 57 minute and 9 second mark

3. 1 hour, 24 minutes and 46 second mark

4. 1 hour, 31 minutes and 43 second mark

NOTE: (This may very a second or two either way, depending on the accuracy of your DVD player's counter, and also may not be as noticeable when played through your TV speakers alone, as I was listening to the sound through a 2 channel stereo speaker set up)

I tried another copy but it too had the audio pops, so it's the DVD master and not just a bad disc.

I also checked out the same spot on the old Republic DVD where the first audio pop occurs, but there's no audio pop or problem of any kind in, or around, that area.

I've made an attempt to contact Paramount through the web site posted on the back of the new DVD's cover, but was unable to get the, ""Contact Us"" link to do anything.

I'd like to find out if this is going to be fixed, or if we're stuck with it as is (as most DVD glitches, when enough people hound the studio about it, get fixed eventually, but in most cases, nothing is mentioned to the general public, and it's only by bugging them yourself, do you find this out).

Case in point, the Back To The Future DVD set.

In the original first run for the widescreen discs, the second and third movie was matted wrong, thus cutting off too much of the bottom of the picture and leaving too much of the top part of the picture visible.

At first the studio wasn't going to fix the problem, but after enough noise was made, the studio relented and made replacement discs, but the catch was that no official notice was given, and unless you contacted them, then you never got the replacement discs.

Let's just hope that this problem is fixed the, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" DVD, as this movie deserves it.",1163203200,30,2294,4.265588914549654

41845,5,0782010792,"This is truly my all time favorite movie.  It's a story about an ordinary man who works hard all his life, giving up his dreams to help others.  When all of a sudden, some disagreeable things start to happen to him(serious things), and it appears he will be disgraced in front of his family, friends, and the whole town, and through no fault of his own.  So he gets desperate and considers suicide.  Just as he's about to do the deed, an unlikely looking angel, named Clarence, shows up to help him.  Since the man thinks his life has so little value, Clarence decides to show the man just how much his life really matters--WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE MAN HAD NEVER BEEN BORN.  In effect, the man had a tremendous effect on the lives of so many others.  I don't want to tell you too much, because I want you to see the movie ""fresh"" if you've never seen it.

Forget the fact that this is a Christmas classic, a fantastic story & script, and is chocked full of fine actors, like the incredible Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, and others.  The most awesome part of this movie to me is the concept that each life touches so many others, and in ways you would never even think of most of the time.  We never stop to think that the stranger, or friend, or co-worker we said a kind word to, or smiled at today, might have undergone such incredible pain, and we just helped them out.  This movie reinforces the idea that doing kind deeds for others can make a profound difference in their lives.

That's why I love this movie so much.  You will probably never know the difference you've made in the lives of most.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few people come back to me and remind me of some simple little nothing things I did for them that positively affected their lives.  Most of those things, I didn't even remember doing! I actually remember a lady I helped who said she was considering suicide.  Was she serious?  I hope not, but she said she was.

So, are you trying to make the world a little better as you travel your path?  You don't have to be Mother Theresa to make a difference.  Just making someone laugh today can be a big deal to them, especially if things are really bad for them right now. After all, laughter is the medicine of the angels.

So, if you've never seen this movie, GET IT!  Watch it and discover a very profound message within the movie--What difference am I making?  Is anyone's life different because I was born?  Then reassess.  If you have seen this movie, buy it anyway, and watch it at least once a year at Christmastime to remind yourself of this concept, to make a positive difference in the world.

More than ever before, WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS LOVE, SWEET LOVE!
Feel it, breathe it, make it a part of your life! Do unto others as you would have done unto you.

God bless you.",1163030400,8,2820,4.311787072243346

There are four notable differences:  1) The very few audio defects from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/60th-Anniversary-Edition-black-and-white-DVD-edition/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">60th Anniversary Edition black-and-white DVD edition</a>&nbsp;that was issued in October 2006 have been wiped clean, thus making this 2009 two-disc Blu-ray the new ""gold standard"" for this title.  2) The old, 14-minute ""A Personal Remembrance"" featurette memorializing the passing of director Frank Capra in 1991 - with interviews from Capra himself and from actor James Stewart and hosted by Frank Capra, Jr. - has been dropped from the 2009 Blu-ray.  3) The subtitles on both Blu-ray discs have been replaced with a sharper white typeface that looks better on high-definition TVs.  4) A second set of subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH) has also been added to both Blu-ray discs.

* All other special extras, i.e., the 1990 standard definition ""The Making of 'It's A Wonderful Life'"" featurette hosted by Tom Bosley - and a re-release theatrical trailer now rendered in high definition (but not cleaned) - have been carried over to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2009-two-disc-Blu-ray/dp/B001UHOWXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2009 two-disc Blu-ray</a>.

* As the cost of Blu-ray players and discs continues to fall through the floor, more buyers are taking the plunge and replacing selected titles in their DVD libraries with high-definition Blu-ray discs.  Although the Blu-ray edition DOES boast the sharpest images to date - in my view, it's not necessary to make the upgrade.  There IS a difference in image quality between the DVD and the Blu-ray - but it's not dramatic enough (especially if you're already using an upscaling DVD player) - to junk your 2006 or 2007 DVDs of this title.  Also note that this film is presented on Blu-ray in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca,"" and the equally wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/34-The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives-34/dp/B009L147EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Best Years of Our Lives""</a>&nbsp;- the latter which beat ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as the Best Picture of 1946 - this film was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.

ORIGINAL 2006 and 2008 PRODUCT REVIEWS BELOW.
=============================================

* Rather than review the content of this almost universally beloved film, I'm just going to comment about the quality of the 2006 60th Anniversary Edition DVD itself.  I've since written an updated review about a new edition of this title, now available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/34-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Set-34/dp/B000VDDDVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Two-Disc Collector's Set.""</a>&nbsp;Please find that review -- which was posted on December 13, 2008.  (Amazon has posted my 2006 review in both places -- even though the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/34-60th-Anniversary-Edition-34-DVD/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""60th Anniversary Edition"" DVD</a>&nbsp;is DIFFERENT from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/34-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Set-34/dp/B000VDDDVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Two-Disc Collector's Set""</a>.

* I've owned nearly every version of this title in almost every format available on home video during the past 25 years. It's true that the CONTENT of this Viacom/Paramount DVD -- including its special features -- is identical to the Republic Pictures Home Video release more than 10 years ago.

* However, this 60th Anniversary edition is spectacular for several different and extremely important reasons.  (I'll address the criticisms some people have leveled about the sound on this 2006 DVD in a little bit, so stick with me.)

* You don't have to be a technical expert to immediately notice the striking improvement of the picture AND sound in this 2006 edition. The print is crystal-clear and in my view, has more vividness and sharpness than ALL other previous releases of this title on home video.

* Proof?  I put my ""old"" THX-version DVD issued by Republic Pictures / Artisan Home Video (the former DVD gold standard for this title) -- into my Sony multi-changer DVD player -- and watched and listened to every frame of this film AND its special features. I stopped and started this ""older"" DVD in several spots -- and stopped and started the new 2006 Paramount edition repeatedly -- so I could compare quality almost ""side-by-side.""

* Hands down -- this 2006 version is fabulous. The spots and dirt have been wiped clean, the sharpness and contrast are arguably better than what film audiences saw 60 years ago. There are no ragged spots, no jumped frames and no lint, fiber or hair fragments along the edges or jumping across the screen. I believe the technicians at Paramount (which acquired Republic Pictures Home Video) -- digitally cleaned EVERY frame of the last DVD release -- so that the film now looks like a million dollars. It's almost too pristine, if there is such a thing. No jump cuts, no ""jump ahead"" sound breaks, no fogged-out scenes, nothing ragged -- with the result being the cleanest and purest version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" ever issued in home video history.

* It gets better. English subtitles were available on older DVD versions of this title, but the 2006 version has a cleaner typeface, wiping out some of the confusing and unnecessary attributions of ""who's saying what"" that were disruptive to some hearing-impaired viewers. In this 2006 version, you'll get a mostly straight, line-by-line reading of what's being said -- as it's being said.

* Meanwhile, the DVD's special features - which includes the same pair of documentaries produced in 1990 and 1991 - are identical in that they were shot on video tape hence there isn't much improvement in picture quality. However, subtitles that WERE NOT available for these special features - are NOW available in this 2006 edition. The only ""extra"" that remains unchanged - is the original 1946 trailer. Subtitles are not available and it has the same raggedness and dirt commonly seen with vintage trailers stored separately from the films they used to advertise.

* I'm highly critical of re-issued DVDs that seem nothing more than an excuse to squeeze more dollars out of buyers for the same material with new packaging. But this 2006 Paramount DVD version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the best to date.  It is NOT in color.  (I own a colorized version for younger people who can't stand black-and-white.  Despite controversy surrounding colorization, know that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-2007-34-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Set-34/dp/B000VDDDVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the 2007 ""Two-Disc Collector's Set""</a>&nbsp;has the same 2006 60th Anniversary black-and-white edition you see here - plus a new ""colorized"" version.  This version uses the same pristine print - but has the added bonus of boasting the best ""color"" hues ever seen for this film, using the latest image technology available.  Despite my preference for black-and-white, the quality of this new colorized version is impressive.)

* Meanwhile, let's address the criticisms about the sound on this new DVD. Go back a little bit. Much was made when Republic Pictures Home Video got the THX LucasFilm sound system seal of approval for ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the 1990s. But it was still two-channel mono with negligible equalization of sound effects. In this 2006 DVD, you'll get consistent two-channel mono and decent sound equalization to minimize ""booming"" and over-modulated portions in the film. In the old versions, you had to turn down the volume a notch during the musical portions -- and turn it back up when the dialogue came back. It's a nit-pick, but you really notice the difference if you're crazy enough to do a side-by-side comparison like I did.

* As for the digital sound ""pops"" that perfectionists keep bringing up -- they're right. They're even in the spots noted by another fine reviewer who listed time codes where you can find them. But in my view, unless you brace yourselves for them to arrive like a booming train - unless you purposely crank up your speakers to carry sound throughout your house - yeah, you ""might"" be annoyed if you demand the same perfection for a film made in 1946 as you would for a film made in 2006. Honestly, the disproportionate attention given to these digital ""pops"" is, in my view, giving fence-sitters the impression that they're supersonic cracks of lightning that will make people jump out of their seats. I didn't twitch at all. They almost ""blended"" into the 60-year-old soundtrack. Yes, I know they're digital defects, but do you remember the zillion ""pops"" scattered throughout dirty prints of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with filthy optical soundtracks? The audio on this 2006 DVD still wins.  You have EVERY RIGHT to demand perfection for your dollars. But as a person who's more fastidious than average - I don't believe most buyers will care about a few ""pops"" in a film that's this old. Combine the overall improvements with the relatively low cost of this DVD - and I still say this is the BEST experience of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" I've ever SEEN and HEARD on home video.

* Finally, another reason to buy this DVD. It's old news to some, but it's not widely known that this version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" can only be broadcast by NBC.  It used to air a zillion times during the holidays on every TV station on earth. It was a quick way to get tired of even a super film you think you know by heart. But Viacom/Paramount now owns this version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and NBC has exclusive licensing rights to air it just once or twice after Thanksgiving.  This is a good thing for future generations to appreciate.

* So junk the old, buy this version and be happy. It may feel painful, but it's worth it. And no, I DON'T work for Amazon NOR for Paramount Home Video.",1162598400,"1,535",12374,5.987535410764872

But I still found it worth purchasing this new release because it is so much more cleaned up digitally.  There are a lot of scratches and specs on the '95 release, even though it was re-mastered in THX.  This new October 2006 release has zero dust and scratches and that makes it a little more special.

  This is Jimmy Stewart's best movie.  His timing and delivery throughout the film are superb and reflect his greatness as an actor better than any of his other movies.

  The plot is also a classic -based on Christian moral values- especially as ""George"" is always willing to take on added burdens for his friends and family, no matter how much they conflict with his own desires to leave his small town behind in order to strike it rich in the big city.  The parallels to New Testament teachings are also striking, as the end result of George's faith and good works leads to his salvation and a tremendous outpouring of support from all his friends and family during what could have been his darkest hour. The last shall be first.  The meek shall inherit the earth.  And do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Amen.

Moreover, it has been restored, or cleaned-up, call it what you will, an incredible improvement over the prior version I have (THX Artisan 2001).  Further I went right to the scene where George and Clarence get thrown out of the bar, then I watched the old one just to make sure; the ""jump"", or bad splice, whatever the issue was, is not visible to this viewer anymore.  Maybe they compressed it somewhat here, or some other computer trickery; regardless, it is now a smooth flowing movement!! One bad point, naturally Paramount HAD to contaminate this ""Special Edition"" with a preview of one of their other, completely unrelated movies- Shame on them!.

41853,5,0782010792,"It's A Wonderful Life  begins in Heaven. Someone on Earth is about to commit suicide and needs urgent help. This man is George Bailey (James Stewart). He is a victim of  his business rival's dishonesty and he faces bankruptcy and jail. George is desperate, he wishes, he never was born. Many people pray for George. Their prayers have been heard and  Angel Clarence is sent to save him. On completion of this mission  Clarence will be honored with angel's wings. On Christmas Eve, George contemplates jumping from a bridge in the freezing waters of a river. That will kill him for sure but Clarence has a plan. He jumps first and George has no choice but to save him. Then Clarence decides to show George what would've  happen if he wasn't born in the first place. Not a pretty picture- too many people would have been affected in a bad way. This is when George Bailey realizes that life is a precious gift and it is wrong to throw it away.

It's A Wonderful Life is a deeply touching movie. There are dark moments when the tragedy evolves but the film is not depressing. It blends masterfully drama and humor, love, friendship and hatred  and its climax is the most memorable and inspirational ever! It's A  Wonderful Life ranks #1 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time and it is truly THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FILM OF ALL TIME because it caries the most important message that WE WERE NOT BORN TO BE A FAILURE. The message is delivered by James Stewart, who was not only a brilliant actor but a living proof of the above- everything he did was success! George Bailey is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest performances. He is superb in portraying George's emotional roll-a-coaster: the enthusiasm  of a young, small-town guy, who wants to conquer the world; the strength of an industrious businessman fighting competitor, who doesn't play fair; the devotion of a loving son, brother, husband and father and the despair of a man, who has lost the battle and sees killing himself the only possible remedy.

Those who criticize the film simply waste their efforts. It's A Wonderful Life stood the test of the harshest of all critics-TIME! For 60 years it entertains, moves, inspires and it is the ultimate Christmas film of millions of people. Perhaps it would be better if the ""critics"" shut up and let us listen to the bells, that ring at the end of the movie to  celebrate LIFE- the greatest of all gifts!

The 60 Anniversary Edition is definitely Black&White copy and  thanks God for it, because this is how it should be! I do not believe that making it colorized will benefit the movie. You can not improve something that is perfect, why bother then? May be the ""artists`s"" next project will be colorizing Schindler's List?!  Why not, it is B&W?  Well, they should ask Steven Spielberg if he would be happy about it. I think, he shot his film B&W on purpose, and so did Frank Capra!",1162339200,8,2909,4.621359223300971

I would really LOVE it if someone could clear this up for me, I really have been wanting to own the colorized version for so long on dvd.  I already own the black and white, and although many people disliked the colorized version on VHS, I really enjoyed it, and want to own that version again.

41862,5,0782010792,"It's a Wonderful Life- It's a classic well known to every generation, even those who claim they hate black and white movies and who never watch family films. Why are Frank Capra's films so universal and timeless, especially this one? Well, watch it and find out.

The story concerns George Bailey (James Stewart), a guy from a small town that everyone knows and loves. As a boy he worked in a drugstore, his father at a savings and loan bank, and when his father died, he took over, despite aching to see the world and go to college. He did his duty but found happiness in a girl in town, Mary (Donna Reed) who became his wife. However, through the storybook life, there was a sense of longing for childhood dreams and a feeling of emptiness in George. This only manifested itself when Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the local rich curmudgeon with selfish ambition, antagonized George. Finally, at a turning point in his life, George is faced with failure and faces an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) whose purpose is to pull George back from the precipice of suicide.

It is difficult not to get wrapped up in such a story. You don't have to be from a small town, you don't have to be married, and you don't have to be middle aged to understand this movie and to love it. The themes and the sentiments are universal. Everyone likes to feel they are basically good and that the forces against them are evil; that is what this story is about, good trying to win over evil. Such a basic idea is enhanced by wonderful camerawork, brilliant acting, and amazing directing done in the golden age of Hollywood.

This is no Christmas story, so do not hesitate to watch it any day of the year. The uplifting tone is often associated with an allotted time for giving each year, but it is appropriate for any time. Perhaps that is what we all need.",1157414400,3,1842,4.508982035928144
41863,5,0782010792,"I can no longer remember the first time I saw this great story of hope and miracles. Once having seen it, you will always remember its story of encouragement and faith, and in a positive way showing that what goes around truly does come around.

George Bailey seems to be a simple man. In fact, he is a simple man. Yet, with his solid values and feeling for what is right and wrong, George touches the lives of those around him. George saves his brother from drowning as a child. When his brother grows older he shoots down an enemy plane during World War II, saving a transport ship into which the plane was attempting to crash. George prevents a pharmacist from accidentally giving a young boy poison as the pharmacist grieved for his own son. George takes on the responsibility for running the Bailey Savings and Loan when his father passes away. The list of good deeds that George performs is long, and he has affected an entire town more than individual lives.

It seems that while George is not wealthy in terms of money, he leads a full life. He has a wife and children, and he is clearly a powerful force for good. His brother is coming home, a celebrated war hero. Life could hardly be better. But then an event occurs that can shake anyone. Eight thousand dollars is lost on its way to being deposited at the bank. Suddenly, George Bailey is under suspicion for embezzlement. Suddenly, all the good deeds that George has performed count for nothing, because George may find himself in prison as repayment for being a good man.

George lashes out at those around him. He has always been the person with the solutions, and suddenly he finds himself in a situation he can't control or solve. He runs from this unsolvable problem, crashing his car, stumbles to a bridge to commit suicide. Before George can jump in, someone else jumps in; an angel with a mission.

George and the angel, Clarence, talk about George's plight, and during the discussion George wishes he had never existed. The angel grants George's wish. We then see the Bedford Falls that would have existed had George never lived. The name of the town is Pottersville and it is full of bars, vice and crime. Many of the houses owned by Mr. Potter are little more than hovels; slums in the making. The people that George touched live a very different life in this alternate reality.

As dark as the movie is at times, at its heart it is a story of hope and miracles. George is given an opportunity to see the difference he has made in people's lives.

I was thinking of this the other day, when I read a research article by a family/child psycologist and in it was an off hand recommendation that every child should watch this movie regularly while growing up. I was not really surprised since I already knew this and had my own children watch it yearly as they grew.  The message is NOT sappy as is sometimes claimed, anymore than being loved and cherished by friends and family is sappy- and I am sure the researchers mentioned above would see a lot less people professionally if this simplistic message was embraced for the healthy ""ideal"" it portrays, instead of blown off as a sappy waste of time.

I never finish this movie without a tear or two, and an all-over feeling of joy.

Most compelling story about a married couple George and Mary Bailey (James Stewart and Donna Reed) who has four kids and their tale of a business hardship. Too many memorable scenes to list here. My absolute favorite scene is when Bailey tells the old fart, Mr. Potter off - who seems to own about everything (if not most everything in town). A true tear-jerker. See it with someone you love. Strictly a seasonal film to watch. Recommended.",1135382400,4,570,4.71
41876,5,0782010792,"One Christmas Eve, thirty years ago give or take, I woke up the house because I was watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" on late night television (which was the only way to see it at that time) and as George Bailey ran back to the bridge to tell Clarence that he wanted to live again the station went to a commercial break.  As Kenneth Burke said a long time ago, form is the creation of an appetite and the satisfying of that appetite in the mind of an audience.  So there I was, getting all ready to start weeping when the snow starts to fall again, and suddenly I am being bombarded with commercials for the sort of projects that are only advertised in the middle of the night.  One reason to own your own copy is that not only can you control the breaks, but you can also watch it any time you need a little Christmas.

The general consensus is that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a timeless holiday classic, a black & white movie that NBC is proudly airing tonight on Christmas Eve once again, because of the point that Clarence Oddbody, AS2 makes to George when he tell him, ""Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends.""  The point is underscored as the film's benediction when Clarence writes that reminder in the copy of Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" and when Harry Bailey proposes a toast to his big brother George as ""the richest man in town.""  The grand irony here is that the only person who does not know these things ends up being George Bailey himself, and the fact that Jimmy Stewart is perfect in the role does not hurt either.

But I would contend that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is also a timeless classic for the simple reason that it makes you cry even more the second time around.  Once you have seen Frank Capra's 1946 film you cannot help but notice how everything in the nightmare sequence is set up earlier in the movie.  Certainly you remember what happened with Mr. Gower and when Harry fell through the ice, but the first time through did you pick when Mary said she married George to keep from being an old maid?  Once you know the story the whole opening litany of prayers (""Something's the matter with daddy"") can get you chocked up.  For me I lose it when young Mary leans over into George's bad ear and says, ""George Bailey, I'll love you 'till the day I die"" (and not because I am deaf in one ear either, but because I am a hopeless romantic).

Like so many of the director's classic ""Capra-corn"" films, namely ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" and ""Meet John Doe,"" the story of George Bailey is basically a crucifixion story.  Voltaire once said that the crucifix represents the wise man assassinated, and in each of those films there is certainly a point where the hero is symbolically crucified in public: to wit, the impeachment in the Senate, the competency hearing, and the mass rally.  But only George Bailey actually descends into Hell as he sees what the world would have been like if he had never been born.  Such stories have become a commonplace on television (""Smallville"" did it for Lex Luthor earlier this month and I have fond memories of the one ""Moonlighting"" did), and there are countless movies in which the main character gets a chance to see the road not taken.  The genre goes back at least to ""A Christmas Carol,"" but whereas Ebenezer Scrooge is the ancestor of Mr. Potter, George Bailey has always lived a good life.  George is so selfless he claims he was the one that lost the money when he goes to Mr. Potter for help.  The guy cannot help but do the right thing.

Granted, there are some imperfections in this divine film, just as a Persian carpet always contains a flaw.  For me the initial levity of Clarence as a blinking star is a bit too cute after the stage is set up by the people of Bedford Falls on bended knee entreating for divine intervention for George.  But once Henry Travers shows up as Clarence in person that is rectified (I like the way he tells George, ""You've never been born,"" as if what was about to happen was the most natural thing in the world.  However, the errors I recall now with regards to this film are my own.  The first couple of times I saw the film I thought that Mr. Potter showed up at the end to join in the festivities because the magic of Christmas was such that even his heart grew to the right size.  For years I was convinced that when they are searching Uncle Billy's hovel for the missing money and it looks like somebody will be going to prison that George not only says ""It's not going to be me,"" but adds ""for once in my life it is not going to be me.""

The romance between Stewart's George and Donna Reed's Mary stands on its own: you could do a movie that ends with them on their wedding night and have a winner.  Still, the reason that the ending is so glorious is that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" gets really dark before the dawn.  The extreme closeup that Capra shoots of Stewart when the enormity of the fall hits George is absolutely harrowing, as is the terror in his face when the spinster Mary collapses and George has totally lost it, because we understand exactly what that means.  In the end we come back to Clarenece's message because George's only problem is that he does not know this simple and profound truth (and because Mary and the people of Bedford Falls have taken care of the missing money regardless of Clarence's intervention).  That is why this is a wonderful movie.",1135382400,9,5440,4.412

My brother-in-law and I both considered it one of our favorite movies. He liked it so much, he actually became George Bailey in real life (worked as VP for a small town bank, and made loans recommendations based more on the quality of the borrower than on their credit rating). At family gatherings, we played a form of Trivia based entirely on this movie... he once stumped me with the following question: where does the bank examiner live? You'll just have to watch the movie to find out. I'll hazard saying one word against this beloved movie... don't rely on an accurate portrayal of angels, nor of what happens to people after they die (we don't become angels, folks)!",1135123200,,844,4.559210526315789
41879,5,0782010792,"Director Frank Capra was a rare find indeed - a voice of optimism through some very troubled times.  Never was that optimism, along with his appreciation for his fellow man, more apparent than in this timeless movie.

Jimmy Stewart is magical as George Bailey, a man who dreams of adventure but is bound to his family business and to his adoring wife and kids.  Donna Reed also lights up the screen as Mary, the woman who stands behind George without hesitation.  George's uncle Billy, played nicely by Thomas Mitchell, has misplaced $8,000 belonging to the family Building and Loan business.  This has occurred on the day that the bank examiner has arrived for a routine inspection.  George has a nemesis in Mr. Potter (the great Lionel Barrymore), a tyranical business man who wants to see the Bailey business go away so he can make even more money. Potter has actually ended up with the missing money, but he uses that to his advantage. In desperation, George contemplates suicide, only to be 'saved' by his guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers).  Clarence offers George a chance to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.

While the cast is uniformly excellent here, Stewart is the heart and soul of this film.  He is an everyman, showing both strength and weakness, desperation and joy.  This movie may strike some as sentimental.  While this is true, the sentiment is honest, and a reflection of the hope that people were looking for as WWII drew to its end.  If the rare opportunity arises, see this one in the theater.  The DVD offers a nice retrospective hosted by Happy Days star Tom Bosley.  Final grade - A+",1134950400,3,1649,4.700348432055749
41880,3,0782010792,"We see the life of George Bailey. Working as a young clerk in a pharmacy, he tried to correct a mistake by the pharmacist, and is slapped around for this. [Could this happen to the son of a banker?] The pharmacist's son had died in the war (influenza!) and this distracted the pharmacist (drank too much?). Later George enters a dance contest, and some of them take an unintended bath [symbolizing the Crash and Depression]. George's college plans are halted by his father's illness [a symbol for hard times]. Another crisis follows the attempt by Banker Potter to appropriate the Building & Loan Society [which provides loans to working people so they could move from the cold water tenements owned by Potter]. But the Board decides to continue with George Bailey as Executive Secretary. George's younger brother goes to college, marries an heiress, and moves away. There is one scene where Uncle Billy has overdone his celebrating [nepotism is always a problem].

Mary gets a call from Sam while George is there. They learn of a stock offer in plastics - ""the deal of a lifetime"". People in Bedford Falls are out of work since the factory closed down. Later George and Mary are married on a rainy day, but are interrupted by a run on their bank [no FDIC in those days]. George takes charge and saves the business from the schemes of Potter. George's speech explains the economics of banking to the audience: they will be all right if they just stick together. One sunny day shows a family (with a goat!) moving to a new housing tract [as occurred in the 1920s]. This was possible after local farming closed down. This affects the rent profits of Banker Potter, whose tenements are losing renters. [They hadn't yet figured out to fill them up with Welfare clients.]

Potter makes a generous offer to buy George. He refuses, and shows he could learn some diplomacy and tact. Trouble occurs when Uncle Billy loses the cash he was supposed to deposit! [Pride goes before a fall.] Potter finds it and keeps it. [Did you expect him to be honest?] This was a management failure on George Bailey's part - sending out a boy on a man's job. George's request for help from Potter is soundly rejected. And so Angel Clarence intervenes. What would happen if George Bailey was never born? [This reminded me of ""A Christmas Carol"".] At the end the people come up with the cash to meet the bank's needs. And so the story has a happy ending. [Can you believe this?] Bedford Falls doesn't wind up as Pottersville.

In real life Banker Potter would have to turn any found money over to the police. Potter has also broken Banking Laws by taking depositor's money without any accounting or receipt. If his servant talked, Potter would spend the rest of his life in jail. Some have noticed the absence of religious persons in this film; what does that say? No mention of other members of the ruling families in this town. I always thought this film had a subtle anti-alcohol message.

41885,5,0782010792,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is arguably one of the best films ever made - certainly the best Christmas film. Frank Capra is one of the most talented directors Hollywood ever produced, and he considered this to be his favorite film. It has been called sentimental - I would call it heart-warming. It is full of what makes life - and a film - wonderful. As far as I know, Jimmy Stewart was the only actor Capra ever had in mind for the part of George Bailey. This is not true of the other characters, although it would be hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles other than the talented cast he chose. The script is superb, the set is one of the largest ever built, the cinematography is excellent. It is, in essence, a wonderful film of a wonderful story of a wonderful life.

You can't beat a story about a person whose life is falling apart, finds himself on the brink of disaster and, through some turn-of-events, changes and comes back. George Bailey is such a person. He has spent his life doing the right thing and helping people whose backs are up against a wall, only to find his own back there and no one to help. He once had big plans for his life - he wanted to build things - but circumstances and his own character have not allowed him to realize those dreams. He has ended up doing the one thing he told himself he would never do: end up living in Bedford Falls running his father's Savings-and-Loan.

But he cares about people. And he's got some wonderful relationships, not the least of which is his wife Mary, played by Donna Reed (who was an unknown at the time). Mary gives George everything he needs in a spouse: love, respect, support, a home, a family and a wonderful companion. George is blessed, but his life has not been easy, especially because of the town ""Scrooge,"" Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore. Potter owns everything - except the Savings-and-Loan. He'd like to own it, but George Bailey stands in his way. The Savings-and-Loan is the only way average people can own a home in Bedford Falls. If Potter gets his hands on it, he'll control the lives of everyone in the town and be able to keep what he calls ""the riff raff"" in his slums.

Now, once again, circumstances take a turn for the worse: Uncle Billy (played by Thomas Mitchell), who works for the Savings-and-Loan, loses $8,000. In 1946, at the time of our story and the movie, this is enough money to put them out of business. Potter, who is aware of the loss, sees this as his opportunity to destroy the Saving-and-Loan and put George in jail. George desperately turns to God in prayer. Then, depressed, he gets drunk. Then, hopeless, he decides to take his own life by jumping off a bridge - but he's stopped by an angel.

He's not just any angel: he's an angel second class named Clarence (played by Henry Travers), who is striving to earn his wings. Clarence is like someone out of the 19th century, when he had his last assignment on earth. When George tells him that it would have been better if he, George, had never been born, Clarence gets an idea. He decides that the best way to help George see the value of his own life is to show him what the world would have been like without George Bailey.

It takes some convincing for George to realize that things have changed: he hasn't been born, so all the good he's done - including saving his brother's life, who later saves an entire ship of Navy men - never took place. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, a decadent cesspool of hopeless despair. After George experiences incident after eye-opening incident of the difference his life has made, he returns to the bridge and cries out to God to let him live and to take him back to his life, which He does.

Even though his circumstances haven't changed, George has. He realizes that, in spite of his circumstances, he is living a wonderful life that is making a huge difference in the lives of others. Before it's over, he realizes something else: because of the life he's living, he has a lot of wonderful people who care for him. As his brother puts it, ""To George Bailey, the richest man in town."" George is rich, but not in money. Potter may be rich in gold, but George is rich in something far more valuable - friends. It's a timely message that will always be needed. It's a story that only gets richer with the telling. And it's a film that seems to get better with age.

41886,5,0782010792,"It may seem like a bit of hyperbole to state that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the best movie ever made, but if you strip away all of the hyperbole that surrounds this movie, you will see that the assessment of it being the best movie ever made is not far from the truth.

Frank Capra assembled a truly ensemble cast who do more than just act, they become the citizens of Bedford Falls. Each character is fully developed right on down to the bank examiner who comes to inspect George Bailey's delinquent accounts and, thus, creates the crisis for George Bailey. The principal actors are brilliant but none more that James Stewart. Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is breathtaking. Stewart takes on a tour deforce as the viewer becomes privy to George Bailey's descent into the personal hell. Bailey believes he has reached this low point in his life because he was too busy taking care of everyone else and spending so little time and resources on the betterment of his own situation. Having been convinced by Mr. Potter, the resident curmudgeon (played admirably by Lionel Barrymore) that Bailey was worth more dead than alive, Bailey first attempts to take his own life, then being granted the wish that he'd never been born and ultimately concludes with Bailey standing on a bridge pleading ""Please! I wanna live again. I wanna live again. Please, God, let me live again.""

Along the way, we see that the people George had helped out in his life suffer immensely by his absence and we learn from Clarence, George's guardian angel that ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?"" We also learn that "" no man is a failure who has friends."" It are these friends who rally to Bailey's cause and give so much to the man who has given them so much.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a christmas movie in that there are themes of self-sacrifice and concern for your fellow man but it is also a movie that was set during christmas in that its themes extend well beyond the confines of christmas.

It is ironic that one reviewer stated ""In lesser hands this theme [every person has an impact on their community] could have been greeting card hokum."" In fact, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" began as ""The Greatest Gift,"" a short story written by Phillip Van Doren Stern. When there were no magazine takers for his short story, Van Doren Stern had a couple hundred copies made and sent them to friends in their Christmas cards. Ultimately, the reviewer's point is well-taken.

Despite numerous opportunities to see this film over the years outside of a few snippets I casually watched this is the first time I've seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in it's entirety.  I had no conscious resistance to the film.  When it was in the public domain it seemed like it was on TV every night on every channel so my thought was I'll catch it some other time.  Some other time finally came and, boy, was I wrong not to catch this cinematic treasure earlier.  This is not just a celebration of Christmas but a celebration of American idealism.  Bedford Falls, a microcosm of middle America, epitomizes the sense of community that we may not achieve but at least aspire to.  George Bailey(James Stewart) is our everyman who perserveres  despite the disappointments life throws at him.  Behind every good man there is a good woman and his wife Mary(Donna Reed) encapsulates that.  The film's basic premise is that every person has an impact on their community, for better or for worse, and despite the curveballs thrown our way life is worth living.  In lesser hands this theme could have been greeting card hokum but in director Frank Capra's hands it is life affirming.",1132963200,6,1235,4.671296296296297

41891,5,0782010792,"I've loved to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for as long as I can remember - and, no matter how many times I've seen it, it always leaves me pondering my own life - wondering what I've contributed to this world & to my loved ones just by the simple fact that I am ""here""...

This is one of those movies that tugs at your soul and, as such, it's one to be watched any time of the year - you don't have to wait for the holiday season to watch this one!  In fact, I think it's an awesome movie to watch anytime you're feeling down & depressed - as it reminds us that no matter how bad it gets, our lives do have meaning - that other people DO benefit from our being alive...

""It's a Wonderful Life"" is about the life of George Bailey (played by James Stewart) - a man who grew up in a small town where everyone knows everyone.  It takes place on Christmas Eve when, due to his thwarted dreams & a looming scandal, he decides that the only ""way out"" is to commit suicide...

However, his suicide attempt fails due to some help from an angel (played by Henry Travers) - a very ""human"" angel who's trying to ""earn his wings"".  This ""angel"" decides that the best way to show George that his life DOES have meaning is to show him what life in Bedford Falls (his small town) would have been like if he was never born.  He's taken to the homes of all the people whose lives he touched, and shown where they'd be now if there had never been a ""George Bailey"".

Through this experience, George finally realizes the amazing, positive impact he really had on these people, and on this town.  At this point, he decides to ""choose life"" - it's a beautiful moment!!!

Overall, this is a wonderful, touching, important movie.  As I said before, it leads one to ponder the difference they've made in the lives of their loved ones - and even the lives of ""strangers"".  Because of this, I would highly recommend this movie to everyone - especially those who may need a reminder now & again that their life truly does have meaning - that they really do make a difference...",1132531200,47,2051,4.257731958762887

Seeing George Bailey a man filled with a million dreams and hopes of ""something more"" than what his small town will allow. George Bailey ends up sacrificing his own hopes and dreams for those he loves- settling what he wants for the ordinary. And on Christmas Eve due to a mishap he thinks of taking his own life. Thanks to a guardian angel that takes him back to his hometown-what it would be like without him... he realizes that his life was worth something...

The movie hits every sentimental feeling you can imagine and it leaves you thinking that no life-even your own is worthless.

Jimmy Stewart gives a performance that makes you fall in love with him each time you see it- the performance that brought him to Hollywood super stardom. With the classic end scene that brings tears to everyone who watches it- for one simple fact George deserves the love and respect they are showing him for after all the good he has done and sacrificed for them. This a movie no matter how many times you watch it you will always be struck with the same feelings of happiness, joy about life, made me want to better myself, and makes you happier about Christmas/ the ones you love. Making you have NO doubt- that it is a wonderful life.

This simple movie will stand the test times for it's unviersal themes and if it is not in your DVD collection shame on you!- Hit the buy now button. But, remember it REALLY is a wonderful life afterall...",1132444800,4,1647,4.461794019933555

Hollywood screen legend James Stewart superbly plays George Bailey, a thoroughly decent guy who after being financially ruined by his evil and scheming rival Mr. Potter, becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. But before he can do so, a man falls into the water below. George jumps in to save him and finds out that the man's name is Clarence...

Nominated for 5 Oscar Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor) ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has an innocence that transcends sentimentality. The movie's triumph is in practically acknowledging the difficulties and disappointments of human life and at the same time cherishing ""old fashioned"" values of Friendship, Sacrifice and Love. Watch the DVD and root for George Bailey, you'd be rewarded by the experience - sincerely guaranteed !

Thus spoke Clarence, angel - second class, to the suicidal George Bailey, owner and manager of the local, recently bankrupt ""Building & Loan Co."" in Bedford Falls, somewhere U.S.A.

Of course George doesn't believe this silly, little old man is really an angel, nor does he believe his wish to ""never have been born"" has just been granted. However the reality of the situation is soon to set in when he discovers that no one in Bedford Falls has ever heard of George Bailey. Not only is he viewed as a stranger in town, but the town itself is nothing like it was before he met Clarence. In fact it's no longer 'Bedford Falls.' It's 'Pottersville.'

Yes, George finally comes to realize that Clarence is right, a life is a terrible thing to throw any. We are all connected to each other in ways we could never imagine, nor fully comprehend. The absence of just one life may have devastating consequences on others.

Has George learned his lesson? Can an angel - second class, reverse the wish and restore George back to his family and friends in time for Christmas? And lastly, has Clarence finally earned his wings? Considering the fact that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is one of the most beloved Christmas films of all-time I'm sure you already know the answer.

Simply the best Hollywood has to offer at Christmas, or anytime of the year! Thanks to director Frank Capra and the whole cast for making this film a part of my holiday family viewing tradition.",1126742400,2,1563,4.591397849462366
41900,5,0782010792,"Since I saw this movie several times before, when I decided to see it again I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  One sign of a truly great movie is that you can watch it more than once and enjoy it.  This is a great movie.

It cuts to the heart of the question of what makes life worthwhile.  The answer that it gives is that the kind acts that we do, the love we show, are what makes life worth living.

I like the way it portrays America as being run by greedy and power hungry men.  The whole world is run by them.  But they don't run everything.  And I believe that the underlying premise of this movie, that there is a Heaven, that there is a God, even that there are angels, is very likely true, and that the purpose of living our lives here is not to amass the greatest fortune before we die.  It's to build bonds of loyalty and love to take home to Heaven with us when we graduate from this school of hard knocks.

I don't want to claim that this movie is perfect.  It never pays to do that.  A good review, even if it's a rave, should have some constructive criticism in it.  I haven't seen a perfect movie yet.

In that spirit I would say that even though Donna Reed's acting is good as George Bailey's wife, the script writer used her as a cardboard character who never falls off her pedestal.  It was a badly written character, a non-person, just too perfect.  I see no reason for that, considering that the writer showed us George Bailey at his worst, badgering a teacher on the phone, badgering his kids, occasionally being a dope.  The writer should have breathed at least a little life and imperfection into Mrs Bailey too.  She should not have been written as a robot.  She could also have been given a sense of humor.

I got a kick out of the cabbie and the cop being named Ernie and Bert.  I understand that the Sesame Street characters were named after them.

In today's world, where we only believe what we can see with our own eyes, I think we've lost some truths that are contained in this movie.  I'm not kidding.  I think there are angels, and I think there is a Heaven, and I think that those things are more real than the chair you're sitting on.  We teach our kids to believe in Santa Claus, and then we pull the rug out from under them and let them know Santa isn't real, but I think you will be surprised to find out that Heaven is real, angels are real, and God is real.  I don't think those are just children's stories.

I would also disagree with the director's decision to show Jimmy Stewart at his worst.  In a few scenes he is really, and there is no other way of putting it, an obnoxious jerk.  As soon as life deals him some legal trouble, he gets really bad.  I'd prefer my heroes to show a little more poise under pressure, and George Bailey fails miserably in that department.  While Donna Reed is far too goody-goody, with no blood running through her veins, Jimmy Stewart is at times a most unlikeable hero.  We have to remind ourselves that he did save a life or two and make a few sacrifices earlier in life.

Another problem I have with this film is that I don't understand how a bank president (isn't that what he is?) and a real estate developer (isn't he that too?) is doing so poorly financially, and why the loss of $6,000 would be so devastating to his savings and loan.  That's a bit much to swallow.  When Uncle Stupid lost the money, I really don't think the roof caves in on a savings and loan.

In other words, we are being fed a sob story that can't be real.

Lionel Barrymore makes a wonderful villain.  Actually he reminds me of Jim Backus as Mister Magoo, minus the myopia.  He represents the Evil Capitalist, the greedy miser who owns everything.  Did you notice that when George Bailey is removed from the picture, it turns out that Mister Magoo turned his town into a place full of girly shows?  That is so funny.  In those innocent post-war days, the way they painted a bad town was by putting girly shows in it.  Drugs?  Crime?  Of course not.  Those were innocent days.

There are times in all our lives that we want to escape our reality, we want to die, we wish we were never born, and so on.  I feel that way a few times a day, actually.  It is comforting to think that it really is important that we lived, that we really did have a good impact on someone.  Did I?  I don't know.  I'm glad for George Bailey's sake that he did.  Now if only he could learn to curb that obnoxious and self centered behavior of his, and be more sensitive to other people's feelings.  Sometimes he's like a child, just popping out with the stupidest and most cutting things.  Good thing he gave us reasons to like him, because it isn't always easy.",1125100800,2,4709,4.2362204724409445

We follow the trajectory of George's life through his youth, his marriage to his high school sweetheart (Donna Reed), and his position as a community leader who is the only buffer between the people and the rapacious Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the richest man in town.  James Stewart gives a truly great performance, believably portraying George Bailey both as a man who inspires the affection of his community and one whose disillusionment and fear drive him into a personal hell from which suicide seems the only escape.

41905,5,0782010792,"The quintessential holiday Christmas classic, It's A Wonderful Life has dominated the seasonal television landscape with its story of love, friendship, and one man's exceedingly relevant life. Filmed in 1946, this Frank Capra masterpiece opened in theaters to a lukewarm reception, but quickly rose in stature following repeated annual television airings in the 1960s to present day. The film is centered around the life of George Bailey - a likeable, ambitious resident of Bedford Falls who harbors dreams of grandeur, but begins to question the meaning of his life when things don't work out according to his plan.

When the story begins, George is a young boy employed by Mr. Gower, the neighborhood druggist. Mr. Gower, having just received news of his son's death - and engaged in the act of getting drunk - inadvertently places poison in a medicine bottle. George discovers the mistake and doesn't deliver the medicine, thus averting a major disaster. The opening scenes also show George saving his brother from certain death by pulling him out of a frozen pond where the ice had broken.

From there, the story jumps several years into the future, where a grown up George harbors dreams of world travel, exploration, and the construction of large buildings. But he ends up staying in Bedford Falls to work for his father's business, a small savings & loan (and the only financial institution in Bedford Falls not owned by the miserly Mr. Potter). Eventually, George falls in love with childhood friend Mary and the two wed, choosing to renovate an old house in Bedford Falls.

When the Great Depression strikes, George uses his own money, ingenuity, and personal demeanor to stave off a bank run that threatens to close down the family business. In so doing, George keeps Mr. Potter from using his numerous resources to force a takeover bid of Bailey Savings & Loan. Thus, he saves the town's residents from being subjected to a Potter monopoly with possibly disastrous consequences. Along the way, George is tempted with offers of riches and travel by Mr. Potter, but he turns him down - opting instead to work for the benefit of the community.

Things seem to be going well for George until his Uncle Billy absentmindedly leaves the daily deposit of the business in a newspaper that he throws in Mr. Potter's lap (while boasting about the military honors bestowed on George's brother). While George and Uncle Billy frantically search for the misplaced $8,000, Mr. Potter sees his opportunity to ruin the Bailey Savings & Loan once and for all. When George appeals to Potter for help, Potter threatens to call the authorities.

Disillusioned, George leaves Potter's office and wanders into the night. After leaving the local bar, he runs his car into a tree and then walks over to a nearby bridge. While on the bridge, George contemplates suicide as a way out. But before he can commit the act, a man falls into the water below. George jumps in to save him, and later finds out that the man's name is Clarence. Clarence claims to be angel working to get his wings. He jumped into the water to save George, and when George wishes he had never been born - Clarence aims to show George exactly what the world would be like had he never been born...

What he sees leads George to believe that his life was more than worth living. He decides to return home to his wife and children and face the consequences of the misplaced money. When he returns home, he finds that people from all over Bedford Falls have come to donate their own money to bail out their good friend George and the community fixture, Bailey Savings & Loan. Clarence receives his wings, and George Bailey is thankful for his numerous blessings.

It's A Wonderful Life is almost magical in its idyllic portrayal of Depression-era, small-town America. The characters (with the exception of Mr. Potter), harkens back to a simpler time when public attitudes toward morality prevailed, where neighbors knew each other by name, and where communities helped each other out. In addition, George Bailey and his friends are likeable people, developing a rapport with the audience that makes the viewer actively root for them and care about what happens to them. This personal connection with the audience (and the audience ability to relate to questioning the meaning of one's life) may well be the key to the enduring success of the story. Having spent over five decades as the number one Christmas movie, It's A Wonderful Life ranks as one of the greatest films of all time.

41912,5,0782010792,"It's a Wonderful Life is a movie that is synonymous with the Christmas season. This classic film from director Frank Capra is still as heartwarming today as it was decades ago when it was first released and it continues to charm more and more generations each and every holiday season.

This movie works on every level, thanks to the story line, the directing, and the actors and actresses involved. Actor Jimmy Stewart plays the likable yet frustrated George Bailey, showing how one man can have it all and almost let it all slip away. Henry Travers plays the role of Clarence, George's guardian angel, and his appearance fits the part perfectly. The same is true of actor Lionel Barrymore in the role as the nasty Mr. Potter. With his evil smile and mean- spirited demeanor, Barrymore fits the role of the greedy CEO to a tee.

Capra's directing is the key to making this movie work and it's doubtful that many others would have been able to duplicate his work. The plot of this movie would seem a little silly at first: man works hard, starts to feel down and out, loses track of a large sum of money, feels he is no longer appreciated, tries to commit suicide, and is rescued by a man who claims to be his guardian angel and takes him back in time to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. But Capra pulls all the elements together and creates a cinematic masterpiece.

This movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. It certainly is a movie worth watching, during Christmas or anytime of the year. It's message is timeless, and it will continue to win over more and more fans with each passing year.",1104105600,2,1651,4.460264900662252

My normally cynical heart usually balks at these kinds of uplifting movies with its feel-good endings that either seem tacked on or just plain false (heck, I'm one of the few that disliked the recent FINDING NEVERLAND, with its cheesy ""just believe"" philosophy; oh, and I'm not too keen on the engineered ""Christmas spirit"" either). But maybe I'm just a sucker for movies in which ordinary men like George Bailey find themselves so disappointed in their lives that they must be reminded---as indeed he is, in genuinely heartwarming fashion---how much of a difference they truly made in the ordinary world. Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU had a similar theme, and I was moved to tears by parts of that movie too (although some of it was admittedly sentimental and slick). And remember the ending of Alexander Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, with Jack Nicholson's character feeling worthless until he picks up a letter from a little kid in another part of the world? That final shot of Nicholson welling up with tears is comparable to the final scene of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, in which nearly an entire town congregates in George Bailey's house to remind him of what  an important man he truly is in the small town of Bedford Falls. Who doesn't want to feel important in some way? And that final quote from Clarence: ""no man is a failure who has friends."" Truly a maxim to live by, if you ever feel down about yourself and your place in the world!

As you can probably tell, then, I love this movie. Director Frank Capra never seems to be pushing for audience goodwill the way he did towards the end of his 1938 Oscar-winning YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; this is probably Capra's masterpiece. And James Stewart, as the American Everyman George Bailey, gives a performance that is stunning in its wide emotional range. You can see why people would like him, and yet you can feel the disappointment he feels in himself. Okay, so the movie is a little long, and the opening shot of the stars talking to each other is laughably cheesy. In the face of the sheer magic this movie conjures forth, those are mere nits. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a wonderful movie. Highly recommended.",1104019200,3,2401,4.633802816901408
41914,5,0782010792,"I watched this show some year back and it brought me to tears, not of sorrow but of joy.  Joy that I am reminded that how fortunate I am to love and be loved.  It is a true reflection of how one is important to those around you and to treasure them.  The saying of 'what goes around, come around' is befitting of this show.  I am from Singapore and there is no snow, with sunshine year round, but after watching the show, it also brought to me the spirit of Christmas and with it, the warmth.  I recommend this show to anyone who needs a 'boost' in life who feels down and that the whole world is against him.",1103760000,3,609,4.041666666666667
41915,5,0782010792,"Everyone has their films that they must watch during certain holidays.  For some reason, at my house we always watched ""Uncle Buck"" on Labour Day weekend.  Likewise, Roger Ebert apparently watches ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" every Thanksgiving.  My wife likes to watch ""When Harry Met Sally"" on New Year's Day.  But Christmas is the time most saturated with films that the season wouldn't be the same without.  ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""White Christmas,"" and some version of ""The Grinch"" are holiday necessities for many people.  My personal favourite of all these films is Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

Because the airwaves are saturated with it (because the copyright was not renewed when it expired in the '70's) it's easy to flip by and watch bits until a commercial comes on.  People who have only seen the film this way are missing the joy of the film - it is a finely-crafted vision of a town, the progress of years of the characters in that town, and the steady wearing down of one man's dreams until one Christmas Eve he decides to take his own life.  What he hasn't noticed is all the good he done, and he's momentarily forgotten how much he is loved - by his extended family, by the people in the town touched by his basic goodness.  He is not a Scrooge or Grinch remarkably transformed by the meaning of Christmas, but a good man worn down and worn out that is then rejuvenated by the Spirit of Christmas.

Capra and Jimmy Stewart evoke such a sense of place and timing that you can't help by be immersed in the story.  The extended cast weaves in and out of the story, without intruding on the primary narrative.  It's suitable for all ages - in 1947, the MPAA didn't allow anything questionable through - but I suspect that younger viewers will grow bored since the film is mostly dialogue and ""grown-up"" events.

This DVD edition looks very good.  The sound is okay, but as usual, the visuals were cleaned up much more than the sound.  There are a couple short (20 minutes) making-of featurettes, one of which is the same as on the VHS edition that came out many years ago (with Tom Bosley as host).  But the main reason to buy the DVD is so you don't have to sit through the ads and suffer the cuts television stations make to cut down the running time.  This film deserves much better than that!",1103414400,5,2324,4.545673076923077
41916,5,0782010792,"Here it is December 16. Last night a small theater in my town

showed ""It's A Wonderful Life"" basically for free (2 canned goods for the food bank were the price of admission). The place was packed. There was applause and not a dry eye when it ended. This is one powerful film. It was a pleasure to see it on the big screen. Don't forget the importance of Mary Bailey, George's wife. She gave her heart to him as a little girl, and never seriously thought about any other man. Remember, she was an unmarried librarian in his flashback. She's the one who offers their honeymoon cash to save the bank. She's the one who organizes the fund-raising campaign while George is off with Clarence. She's the one who wished for their dream house and life together when she threw the rock at that old house. She renovated the old house (with help from Bert and Ernie) while George was on another crusade against Mr. Potter. She didn't get the face time, but Mary Bailey was an immensely important character in the film.

The secondary characters played very important roles too. Everyone wants to have an Uncle Billy. And know guys like Bert & Ernie. The gate keeper on the bridge, Martini, Mr. Gower, Violet, the Bailey family's maid, Nick the bartender, and of course, Clarence. And everyone knows a Mr. Potter, either as a person or as a corporation.

Everyone should own a copy of this wonderful film.",1103155200,3,1394,4.568
41917,5,0782010792,"I don't think some of the key negative aspects of this holiday film have truly been discussed in depth enough. Near the beginning of the film when the old druggist slaps the young George Bailey on the side of his head several times, the husband of the teacher who punches George in the face in the bar, George's own turn to violence, the man in the crowd who yells out ""Someone hit him over the head with a bottle!"" when George is trying to find out if anyone in town knows him after the angel grants his wish of never being born, and of course the hateful Mr. Potter. The film can definitely show the negative dark side of human nature if one looks for it. It reminds me of a teacher who once wanted all of her students to take time out of the regular class schedule to practice for a Christmas PTA show for a bunch of hypocrits and resorted to using a threatening dark tone to try and make the students show up for the ""show"".

Aside from the dark aspects, the film does endure as a classic even though real life stories don't always turn out like the climax of this film. The black and white cinematography is nicely done and on another positive note, everyone should be more like the angel Clarence in the film, happy and free and ordering his ""flaming rum punch"" or whatever his drink of choice was at Martini's bar.

41919,3,0782010792,"The ending of this movie is totally outrageous, and yet somehow perfect.  I had a nagging sense that with the ending Frank Capra was trying to keep me in line, making sure I keep treating people with respect and all that nonsense.  And he fully expects me to do so knowing that I know it is not in my best interest. In fact he spends the first  of the film telling me that to be unselfish in a selfish world will lead to my demise.  But I already knew that.  Still, myself and millions of others watch this film, every year, fooling ourselves into thinking that our kindness will be rewarded.  Self-delusions are not the only reason I will recommend this film.  James Stewart is, as always, worth the price of admission.  The script is very smart and witty, and there is no way to deny the charm of these characters.  You will fall in love with George Bailey as his hopes and dreams are put on hold while he prevents his town from selling out to The Man.  I also got a big kick out of watching Bert and Ernie hanging out together.  We, as Americans, love to cheer George Bailey for choosing humanity over money.  Yet we also, continually, choose money over humanity.  In that respect it's a good thing this movie has survived through the decades, and maybe one day we will all quit contributing to Pottersville.

Much as many people would like, you can not re-write the past. I think this is a great movie, with an awesome lesson.

The movie has wonderful performances from Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and a long list of others. Frank Capra left a lasting legacy when he gifted us with this one.

41922,5,0782010792,"Would you believe that this film tanked at the box office?  Critics ripped it to shreds saying that it was too sappy and sweet.  Humbug.  This is the most classic film of all time and if you haven't seen this yet then you haven't really had Christmas.  Yes, yes I know they show it 500,000 times every Christmas but that's because people love it so.  I'm glad that Jimmy Stewart lived long enough to see it become so loved by movie watchers around the world.

In case you've been living on Mars for the past hundred years, it's the story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who wants to build great buildings and travel the world.  He feels left out as all his friends go on to college while he helps his father at the family business.  Just when he's all set to finally go to college his father dies and he has to stay on at the Bailey Building and Loan.  A few years later his brother comes home but has just gotten married and received a job offer even though he was supposed to be coming home to take over the business so George could finally travel.  No such luck.

Finally George realizes that he's not going anywhere and he's married with four kids.  One day his uncle misplaces $8,000.00 bucks and George is threatened with jail time.  He loses all hope and decides it would be better if he had never been born and plans to commit suicide but an angel shows him what would have happend if he had not been born. The angel convinces him that he should not throw away God's greatest gift.  It turns out that he helped so many people (including saving the life of his only brother) none of them would have made it without his help.  Because he saved his brother, his brother was able to save the lives of many of his comrads in the army.  Because of that, his brother won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  But George learns that if he had not been there to save his brother, every man on that army transport would have died because his brother would not have been there to save them.  Because he helped so many along the way, they in turn help him when he's in the darkest pit of his life.

This may be the most spoofed movie of all time.  Saturday Night Live spoofed it more than once and so did Married with Children just to name a couple of shows.  Perhaps even more spoofed is the ever popular Scrooge.

It's a Wonderful Life is a Timeless classic.  It applies itself to any year, any day, any country, any family, any race.  ""One life touches so many others.""  Ain't that the truth.  Don't pass this by.  Please watch this with your children.  It is still as heart warming as ever.  You can even take it back to Mars with you when you leave!!!",1101686400,2,2650,4.286290322580645
41923,5,0782010792,"For those of you visiting Earth for the first time and who have no idea what this film is about, here is a review:

""It's A Wonderful Life"" begins in heaven, as angels discuss the sudden glut of prayers from the citizens of Bedford Falls, as they ask for help for George Bailey.  A man worthy of support from above, the angels decide to help George and dispatch Clarence, an angel in training, to do the job.

The first ninety minutes of the film work as Clarence's (and the audience's) crash-course in George Bailey 101, as Clarence views the most important events in Bailey's life.  Clarence sees George as a little boy saving his brother's life and correcting potentially dangerous errors of his original employer, the town pharmacist.  As the young boy grows into an adult (Jimmy Stewart in the role for which he will most be remembered), George's life becomes one of compromise.  His dreams of seeing the world and a life of ""importance"" must be tempered and put on hold, as George settles for a job in his father's building and loan.  His friends and younger brother go off to exciting careers and fight in WWII, while George gets stuck in Bedford Falls and tries to convince the townsfolk to invest in each others' homes.

Clarence comes in to George's life just as he has decided his life is a failure.  Wishing he had never been born, Clarence grants that request and lets George see Bedford Falls as it would be without George Bailey.  What follows is a declaration as to the power of the individual, as George gets to see how much his life changed the world for the better.

Singed into our culture and as regular a part of the Christmas season as long lines at Wal-Mart, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the rare film that literally affects people's actions.  Almost everyone sees in George Bailey the humanity that we all can be and once dreamed of being.  The yearly viewing of this film reminds people of noble intentions they once had and the compromises we all make along the way.  I have no doubt that the night after this film is shown each year (usually the Saturday after Thanksgiving) people all across our country hit their pillows with goals and promises of doing better and doing more with their lives.  This little movie shows us all that we matter in the world, and that's a message we all need to hear from time to time.",1101600000,4,2342,4.542857142857143

I have watched this movie dozens of times over the years and a video copy was given to me as a present from a very good friend of mine.  Anytime I start to feel sorry for myself or think I got a bad turn, think of what the world may be without you, all the people you may have given directions to, helped someone cross a street, gave to a charity (if you never did this things than there is no sense to the movie).  Each movie does not have to be a Cecil B DeMille do be worth something, hopefully by watching this movie you will look at your life in a different way.

The movie is based largely on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, except in this case instead of a scrooge we have George Bailey.  George is a hardworking, decent, and kind man who runs a small bank in town.  Unfortunately for him, the bad guy in the movie, Mr. Potter also runs a bank and wants a monopoly in the town.  When one of George's employees loses a large sum of money Potter jumps in and tries to ruin George.  Distraught over his predicament, George jumps off a bridge.  But - an angel comes along and saves him, for the moment.  Clarence, the likable angel that looks more like an older, drunk but beloved uncle than an angel, shows George what life in the town would be like had he not lived.

41931,5,0782010792,"How do you describe Frank Capra's style? I once called it like Orson Welles, only happy. Visually, these two film-makers were both fond of high-contrast photography and capturing emotions in the characters of their movies. But whereas Welles seemed to focus on all the terrible things that human beings can become, Capra focused on life lessons and the good that lies inside of all people.
While Capra created many masterpieces, this is probably his greatest. It's easy to see why. Rather than focusing on just one aspect of life, this film (like Citizen Kane) captures a person's whole life, with all it's ups and downs. Basically the story is a simple tale of David and Goliath relationship between the small businessman and the evil monopoly, and the internal struggle in a man between what he wants to do, and what he feels that he has to do.
Perhaps there is a bit of George Bailey in all of us. He's a perfectly normal person with perfectly normal dreams. He wants to see the world, build things, become important. But over and over again, in order to help (and in some cases save) others he is forced repeatedly to give up his dreams in order to do what he knows is right. Along the way he builds relationships with all sorts of people in the town where he is forced to spend his entire life. But was what he gave up really an unfair trade? Or did he actually attain a treasure far greater than he could ever imagine?
The emotional climax of the film at it's end (where everything comes full circle and we finally understand how George Bailey got to the point he was at in the film's beginning) has got to be one of the greatest performances in any film ever, and Jimmy Stewart's moment of moments (perhaps only rivaled by his breakdown at the end of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). I recall the first time I saw this movie, and the huge emotional reaction I had at seeing a man who has done nothing but sacrifice all his life kicked when he's down (if you remember what happens immediately after he prays for help you'll know what I mean).
Ultimately, this movie changed my life. It taught me about the importance of friends, self-sacrifice, and living your life doing what you know it right. But even more than that, this movie is an absolute tour-de-force, and stands out in my mind as one of the greatest films ever made.",1085702400,5,2331,4.513002364066194

41933,5,0782010792,"This uplifting film directed by Frank Capra was released in 1947; still being watched years later, It's a Wonderful Life is a true classic.  Starring James Stewart and Donna Reed it was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  The message this story portrays is timeless; not only that no one is poor who has friends, but also that you reap what you sow.  When George Bailey (Stewart) was a young man he was driven by his dreams and desires to explore the world and build great things.  Unfortunately, George's dreams were repeatedly put on hold by his sense of obligation to his deceased father, the struggling family business, and his friends in Bedford Falls.  After years of living in the small town that he always longed to escape and doing a job he never really wanted, impending bankruptcy causes George to hit an all time low.  Contemplating suicide, it takes a guardian angel to make him see all the good things that he accomplished in his life and how many lives around him that he touched beginning when he was just a boy.  James Stewart gives an emotional performance; whether he is praising his father's morals and decency as a human being, praying to God for guidance, or celebrating his new outlook on life the viewer can relate to his passion, desperation, or joy.  Throughout his life George Bailey sowed and nurtured many friendships and in the end he reaped the rewards of each and every one.  I give it five stars.",1082764800,2,1475,4.686046511627907
41934,5,0782010792,"It's a Wonderful Life is one of the staples of any cinematherapy collection. It is a remarkable feat to show us a man metaphorically drowning in despair and contemplating his literal suicide by drowning, and then to guide us through a deft tour de force that transforms that rejected/disowned life into one of joy, affirmation, and triumph! This film is Capra's greatest achievement, and Jimmy Stewart reported it as his personal favourite of his career.
I have recommended this film to many clients, and it has its own meaning to each of them. A number find it difficult to embrace a film that in many ways preaches the virtues of self-sacrifice and constantly putting the needs of others before that of the self: and in many ways, this does run counter to much of the emphasis that is ascribed to self-fulfilment and `personal actualization' in popular psychology. Despite these perceived difficulties, most of them find it to be up-lifting and a splendid affirmation of the human spirit. Not least because many of them have personal heroes or family members who have made remarkable personal sacrifices for the benefit of others: significantly, like George Bailey, it was enough for these people to have had the privilege of serving others, the sacrifices were not made with the intention of forming a network of obligation and guilt.
Bailey word paints a wonderful life for himself:
I'm shakin' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then, I'm comin' back here to go to college and see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields, I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high, I'm gonna build bridges a mile long...
He makes a valiant defence of the civilising effect of giving working people the opportunity to benefit by their labours, and making them stake-holders in the community to which they belong. ""This town needs this measly, one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.""
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about. They do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
Ironically, his verbal skills are partially responsible for the dashing of his dreams when his impassioned defence of his father's vision leads to the board voting to save the Bailey Savings and Loan Co. if George will agree to sacrifice his dreams, and stay on to succeed his father.
Throughout It's a Wonderful Life, we see George Bailey as all too human in his discontent, frustration, and despair, yet we also see him demonstrate the strengths and virtues that are the affirmation of what is best about the human spirit. Ironically, one of the strengths that he seems to lack is gratitude (see ""Character Strengths and Virtues"" by Peterson and Seligman; or ""Authentic Happiness"" by Marty Seligman, which also describes the `Gratitude Visit', of which the closing scenes of this film are such a triumphant example). The arc of the story gives us (and George) an opportunity to see what life would have been like if he had not been there: we have the nightmarish Pottersville, and a film noirish re-introduction to characters whom we have already `met' but now see in their degraded guise, because George was not there to help them (the degradation of the druggist, Mr. Gower, who is imprisoned for his dispensing error, and becomes the town drunk, is especially moving). Unbeknownst to him, George's compassion, love, and empathy have saved the human dignity and spirit of Bedford Falls.
We learn that George Bailey may be poor in material terms but he is spiritually rich in the goodwill and love that his actions have garnered. In contrast to the abuse of talents that is embodied in the sterile, spirit-destroying Potter, Bailey has social capital and learns the truth of his father's motto ""All you can take with you is that which you've given away."" Clarence (the Angel/Guide) sums it up when he says,
You see, George, you've really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
Ultimately, George Bailey leads a very different wonderful life to the one that he envisaged, but his reality is no less powerful or influential than the one he had constructed in his dreams. He may not have built the structures of which he dreamed, but he was responsible for the utopian/usonian Bailey's Fields, and shares some of the kudos for all of the social order and advantages that flowed from that strong community of families. Bailey may have been measured and categorised as 4F and unfit for military service, but his courageous actions as a child in saving his war-hero brother are shown to have indirectly influenced the survival of hundreds of soldiers.
George Bailey is one of those unsung heroes who is destined for `valour without renown': it is a moving irony that it takes the collapse of his world and a descent into despair for him to learn how much his life has enriched the lives of both those he knows, and those whom he will never know. It's A Wonderful Life is one of the finest cinematic affirmations of the human spirit.",1079913600,9,5550,4.77627471383975
41935,5,0782010792,"A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.
This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature.

It's also a great self-esteem boosting flick for those nights when you feel down.
Jimmy Stewart is absolutely phenomenal and in the movie he represents the good in all of us. He tries to save his little town, Bedford Falls, from the evils of Mr. Potter who represents the evil in all of us.

41939,5,0782010792,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go. Now before we start breaking out into song, let's focus on what the Christmas holiday means to all of us. For younger children, this is the time to be away from school and enjoy all the wonderful presents they have begged Santa for over the past four to five weeks. For the more adult crowd (at least most of them), Christmas is the time to gather with family and friends, swap stories and memories, and hope they don't get a necktie or socks as a gift. The festive yuletide season is also the time when the greatest films of all time are shown across millions of televisions sets across the country and possibly the world as well. You have your comedies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, the cartoon treasures such as A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and those delightful classics like White Christmas and The Bishop's Wife. But none of these can hold a candle to Frank Capra enduring theatrical triumph, It's a Wonderful Life. Amazingly the feature wasn't considered a Christmas film until its repetitive showings in the 1970's when the copyright on the film went up. Now it is basically considered a near crime for this film not to be seen at least during this festive time of year. Quite amazing to see how a total box office dud can rise over the years to be not only the greatest Christmas film but one of the most enduring classics of all time.
The story follows a man who is at the end of his rope and how he discovers that he really has bigger purpose in life then he had originally thought. George Bailey is a good man who has never accomplished the goals he once set for himself as a young boy. Growing up in the little town of Bedford Falls, George dreamed of venturing out into the world and visiting many different and exotic places without a care for anybody else but himself. Unfortunately luck does not seem to be on his side as every opportunity he has to escape the little town ends with him in the same place he has been for all of his life while others get to enjoy the life George wishes he had. Now in charge of his father's loan office, George Bailey faces one of the greatest challenges of his life. Uncle Billy has lost the $8,000 that the loan office carried and Mr. Potter, the richest and stingiest man in town, has issued a warrant for his arrest. George now contemplates taking his own life until his guardian angel shows him the world as if he was never born and it's a more frightening situation then he had ever imagined. The story for It's a Wonderful Life is quite a simple premise and yet it has to be one of the most inspiring and insightful plots in motion picture history. No other film in recent memory can claim it has pulled off the same premise as wonderfully as Capra's classic has.
Though there are many memorable performances in It's Wonderful Life, the overall emotional support lies on the performance of only one man, James Stewart. It was once said of director Frank Capra that Stewart was his first and only choice for the role of George Bailey and that shows in his emotionally driven performance in the two hour feature. Jimmy Stewart showcases a wide range of expresses from his frustration when Uncle Billy loses the money, till exasperation when he stands at the bridge contemplating whether to kill himself or not, to his exuberance at discovering he is able to live once again. James Stewart has to be one of the most treasured performers ever to come across the silver screen and no more so then in this film. What makes this feature even more special is the fact that this was the performer's first feature film since coming back from his service in World War II. Jimmy Stewart should be revered not only for his dedication to his profession but to his country as well.
Overall, It's a Wonderful Life's message of necessity and good nature of man kind rings no harder in the minds of movie-goers then it does today. Plenty of classic holiday films have come along over the years including such favorites as The Santa Clause, The Grinch, and the recent smash-hit, Elf, but none of them can ever come close to the staying power of Frank Capra's crowning achievement. The truth is that the messages expressed in the film go way beyond the holiday season and can be enjoyed during any time of the year with as great of amount of enthusiasm as if the Christmas spirit was all around. Granted the film has been labeled overly-sentimental but if anything that is more a greater compliment then anything else one can say about one the true treasures in cinematic history.",1072569600,2,4630,4.5394736842105265
41940,5,0782010792,"I can no longer remember the first time I saw this great story of hope and miracles.  Once having seen it, you'll not forget its story of encouragement and faith, and in a positive way showing that what goes around truly does come around.
George Bailey seems to be a simple man.  In fact, he is a simple man.  Yet, with his solid values and feeling for what is right and wrong, George touches the lives of those around him.  George saves his brother from drowning as a child.  When his brother grows older he shoots down an enemy plane during World War II, saving a transport ship into which the plane was attempting to crash.  George prevents the pharmacist from accidentally giving a young boy poison as the pharmacist grieved for his own son.  George takes on the responsibility for running the Bailey Savings and Loan when his father passes away.  The list of good deeds that George performs is long, and he has not touched so many individual lives as he has an entire town.
It seems that while George is not wealthy in terms of money, he leads a full life.  He has a wife and children, and in he is clearly a powerful force for good.  His brother is coming home, a celebrated war hero.  Life could hardly be better.  But then an event occurs that can shake anyone.  Eight thousand dollars is lost on its way to being deposited at the bank.  Suddenly, George Bailey is under suspicion for embezzlement.  Suddenly, all the good deeds that George has performed count for nothing, because George may find himself in prison as repayment for being a good man.
George lashes out at those around him.  He has always been the person with the solutions, and suddenly he finds himself in a situation he can't control or solve.  He runs from this unsolvable problem, crashing his car, stumbles to a bridge to commit suicide.  Before George can jump in, someone else jumps in; an angel with a mission.
George and the angel, Clarence, talk about George's plight, and during the discussion George wishes he had never existed.  The angel grants George's wish.  During the next portion of the movie we see a Bedford Falls that would have existed had George never lived.  The name of the town is Pottersville and it is full of bars and vice and crime, and many of the houses owned by Mr. Potter are little more than hovels, slums in the making.  The people who George touched live a very different life in this alternate reality.
As dark as the movie is at times, at its heart it is a story of hope and miracles.  George is given an opportunity to see the difference he has made in people's lives.  George discovers that while evil has befallen him, the evil that he has personally averted is far worse.  On the small chance you have not seen this movie, I'll not reveal the ending, but you may trust that the ending always brings a smile to my face.
The DVD restoration of this classic is excellent, a significant improvement over the numerous poor copies previously available on VHS.  Make this movie one of your family's favorites for Christmas and any other time of the year you need to be cheered.",1072483200,4,3089,4.510791366906475
41941,5,0782010792,"Back in the 70's I went to see ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at a theatre that specialized in old movies.  I hadn't heard much about this one but I thought I'd take a chance since it boasted both Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra.  What a major surprize that screening turned out to be.  It was as though someone had dug up a previously forgotten movie on par with ""The Wizard of Oz"".  I don't know how this movie drifted into obscurity for so many years but it has really busted out of it now, hasn't it!
What this movie offers is a solid family experience with a lesson for all.  At first it seems like just another ""good"" movie as we see the life of a young man (Gearge Baily) being recounted by some angels up in heaven.  All seems well but it also appears that the weight of the world keeps getting added to George Baily's back one pound at a time.  In time this happy life reaches a breaking point and then we start to see the real beauty of the story.  George Baily's guardian angel, Clarence, grants him his wish to see what life would be like if he (George Baily) had never been born.  Now all those minor and major incidents in George's life that we saw in the first two thirds of the movie suddenly take on a very special meaning.  We see how those things affected the lives of so many people and (this IS a Capra movie afterall) always for the better.  In case you haven't seen this movie, I'll leave the plot hanging there.  The ending is truly heart-warming.
This movie has a lot going for it besides the plot.  The directing is terrific as is usually the case in a Frank Capra movie.  The acting is terrific with Stewart taking the lead as George Baily.  Henry Travers may have been a lesser known character actor in his other roles but he achieved immortality (forgive the pun) as Clarence ASC.  Donna Reed is well-cast as the girl-next-door who grew up to be Mrs. George Baily.  Lionel Barrymore is terrifically sinister in the role of Old Man Potter.  There are plenty of others who make this movie great.  Indeed, the nature of the plot has a seemingly record number of role-players who are essential to the story.
If you haven't yet seen this movie, then you have been missing a real treat.  When you do get around to seeing it, I recommend that you see it from the start.  It's really impressive the way everything eventually fits together so neatly.  This movie is like a warm hug on a sad day.  It will really pick you up!",1072224000,4,2435,4.314977973568282

This movie speaks loudly about the significance one mans personal contribution to the welfare and quality of life of those around him/her.  It reminds us that we're all tightly connected to each other and that ""doing good"" tends to compound and become easier when practiced as a personal philosophy.

41947,5,0782010792,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is often thought of as a Christmas movie -perhaps because it has become a tradition to show the movie on television every year in December. Only a very small part of the story takes place during the Christmas season, though, and that's at the film's conclusion. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is most likely considered a Christmas film because it embodies the ""Christmas spirit"". No other movie has championed the spirit of giving and sacrificing one's own desires for the good of others so successfully as this film.

""It's a Wonderful Life"" stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a bright ambitious man who is also considerate and generous to a fault. He is so considerate and generous that he has always sacrificed his own happiness and goals so that others might pursue theirs. When bad luck strikes a final blow, it seems like all of his generosity has brought George nothing but dissatisfaction and a bad end. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to convince George that he has had a wonderful life, after all, and one that is very much worth living.

""It's a Wonderful Life""'s message is more idealistic than realistic. And I'm not sure that advocating constantly putting the happiness of others ahead of your own is at all wise. But this is a wonderfully entertaining and well-constructed film nonetheless. Jimmy Stewart is due much of the credit for the film's success. This is one of his finest performances. Perpetual self-sacrifice could easily grow tedious, and George Bailey would be a  saccharine character in the hands of a lesser actor. But with the help of a terrific script, Stewart makes George sympathetic and interesting. The supporting cast does a fine job. The cinematography and art direction are excellent. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is simply a pleasure to watch, which is why it has become a Christmas classic. Recommended for viewing on cold winter nights. Somehow that works best.

  George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grew up in this American town, and did many things in his life that are very valuable to others (he saved his brother's life, he saved his father's banking company from a miser, he married his childhood sweetheart (played by Donna Reed), he saved his own boss from jail by refusing to give the poisioned pills to a customer, and more)...but George didn't realize that after he found out money was misplaced (really stolen by miser, Mr. Potter), and he was to go to jail. He tries to commit suicide but angel Clarence saves him, and showed him what life is like without George. George realized that the people he loves and likes don't recognize him (and his brother was dead because he wasn't there to save him), and wishes his life back, which it did happen after the cop asked him what's wrong. At the end, which really touched me, was the whole town comes in with money to help save George's banking company. The police decided not to arrest him, and it's a wonderful life for him again.

I'm caught up in the family -- the father, the dear mother, the devoted children of all ages, the comings and goings in that bustling house, the rowdy happy group of friends (it REALLY was like that back in those days), the trademark ""Hee Haw"" that lasted thru time and trauma, and the close-knit group of citizens who took their civic duties and neighborliness seriously.
The plots and subplots are dexterously woven into one another, running seamlessly from very funny Damsel-in-Distress-Caught-in-the-Bushes followed immediately by the very serious and heartbreaking family trauma and seriously sick father - yet nothing is sacrificed by this transition of plots, neither human dignity nor plotline.
This movie held me spellbound -- boy did I ""freeze"" when I looked down into that ice-bound dark and freezing river. How my heart sank when I saw the once happy home turned into a dark dilapidated abandoned hulk, in the living ""dream"".
But then ... a heart chastened, an angel about to get his wings, a ""Hee Haw"" -- and the world turns right side up, once again letting in the warmth of Christmas Cheer and the true meaning of FRIENDSHIP, DEVOTION and FAMILY.

41955,5,0782010792,"It was produced and directed by Frank Capra who collaborated with Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling on the screenplay. Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) it won none. Over the years, however, it developed a loyal following, largely comprised of those who appreciate Capra's films. Only in recent years has it received the recognition and praise it deserves. How to describe this film? It focuses on a thoroughly decent man named George Bailey (James Stewart) who, after being financially ruined by his evil rival Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. George is rescued by his guardian angel, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), and permitted to learn what would have happened if he (George) had never been born. Only then does George fully appreciate how precious life is. Of course, the film has a happy ending.
Many people think this is a corny film but I do not. As in other films (notably in Meet John Doe), Capra celebrates certain basic values which guided and informed George throughout much of his life. When facing financial disaster which involves not only him and his family but countless others who entrusted to him their limited funds...and their own dreams for a wonderful life, George temporarily loses his faith in those values and his will to live without them. He regains his appreciation of life only after a near-death experience and a realization of how important his life had been to others. I am reminded of the situation in Thornton Wilder's Our Town when Emily Webb fully appreciates only in death what she had not previously while alive in a town very much like Bedford Falls..
It is noteworthy that Leo McCarey, a contemporary of Capra's, affirms many of the same values in films he directed such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's. When It's a Wonderful Life appeared in 1946, the World War II had only recently ended. Moreover, only 17 had years had passed since the stock market crash. Several contemporary accounts of American society during the mid-1940s note an excitement about opportunities which had been denied by the Great Depression and then delayed by the recent war. An entrepreneur, George Bailey's dream is to enable as many people as possible in Bedford Falls to own their own home. The film traces his efforts to make that dream a reality while he also marries Mary Hatch and they start a family. Yes, George is idealistic and somewhat naive but has business acumen. Regrettably, he is vulnerable to....
I am among those who cherish this movie and the values which it affirms. I am especially grateful for the documentaries, ""The Making of It's a Wonderful Life"" and the special tribute to Frank Capra, ""A Personal Remembrance"" from ""Frank Capra Jr.,"" which accompany it in its DVD format. Until recent years, seeing it again was among the highlights of my holiday season. What happened? By way of concluding this brief commentary, I presume to suggest that those who allowed this film to be overexposed on television every December should be strapped into their seats in a screening room, eyes held open with duct tape, and required to watch the following films (repeated over and over again) for 168 consecutive hours: Battlefield Earth, Barb Wire, Howard the Duck, It's Pat, Little Nicky, and Wild Wild West. I further suggest they be joined by those who have butchered directors' cuts such as Sergio Leone's of Once Upon a Time in America.",1058054400,10,3496,4.9271186440677965

What can I say about It's A Wonderful Life (1946) that has not already been said?  Some may say, ""Oh, I have already seen it many times"".  Well, allow me to give you a reason to buy this DVD.  This version is the ""original uncut version"".  All 132 minutes (2 hours,12 minutes) are here.  No scratching, no popping and no skipping of footage.  The print is crystal-clear in beautiful black & white.  Special features on this DVD is the original theatrical trailer.  Also includes the 1990 featurette ""The Making Of It's A Wonderful Life"", hosted by Tom Bosley.  This featurette includes several interesting tidbits of information about special effects used, surprise casting and locations.  There are interviews of Frank Capra, James Stewart and Sheldon Leonard.  Another featurette is ""A Personal Remembrance"". A 1991 special tribute to Frank Capra, hosted by Frank Capra Jr. There is an interview with James Stewart.  A bit of trivia I would like to share is Larry Simms (who played ""Pete Bailey"") and Danny Mummert (who played ""Little Marty Hatch"") are also in this film , but not in a scene together.  They, of course, both worked closely together in the ""BLONDIE"" film series from 1938-1950.

In the cast: Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Charles Lane, Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, Dick Elliott, Ellen Corby, Larry Simms, Karolyn Grimes, Jimmy Hawkins, Carol Coombs, Danny Mummert, Lillian Randolph, William Edmunds, John Indrisano, Charles Sullivan, Max Wagner, Sheldon Leonard.

Coca-Cola is seen in this film. It is on the hang-over lamps in Mr. Gower's Drug Store and later on a sign when Jimmy Stewart runs in downtown Bedford Falls.

This movie was chosen to be preserved and was added to the National Film Registry in 1990 by the United States National Film Preservation Board.

Remake:  One tv-movie I would highly recommend is IT HAPPENED ONE CHRISTMAS  (ABC,1977).  This is the same storyline of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946), a re-telling if you will, with Marlo Thomas in the starring role. Cloris Leachman as ""Mary's Guardian Angel"", Wayne Rogers as ""George Hatch"", Doris Roberts as ""Ma Bailey"" and Orson Welles as ""Mr. Potter"".

41959,5,0782010792,"What do you say about the quintessential Christmas movie that hasn't already been said?  Nothing, so I won't try.  This is movie making at its best.  Great characters, great actors (supporting and main), great story, great direction, and superb messages.  ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was perhaps at its best when it was still in the public domain and could be watched practically every hour on a different television station.  Thanks to a greedy media industry, we can now only see it once a season, or on DVD.  Okay, enough of this soap box.
George Bailey is a man down on his luck.  His dreams always took him far away from Bedford Falls, but his realities kept him firmly secured to this small New York town.  Every time his bags were packed, another emergency forced him to take on another responsibility that would more deeply root him.  Finally, he faces another crisis from circumstances beyond his control that make him consider suicide.  What could keep him from jumping off the bridge?  A well meaning angel named Clarence that knew George would never fail to do the right thing for someone else.  In an answer to George's prayer, Clarence shows him a world without George Bailey.  For a brief time, he sees how his life and love had made a real difference on those around him.
The morals of this movie aren't likely to be seen in Hollywood for a long time to come, if ever.  So enjoy this treasure from 1946.  It might not be ""realisitic,"" but it should be.",1044576000,8,1464,4.598455598455598
41960,5,0782010792,"With the possible exception of either 'The Wizard Of Oz' or 'The Sound Of Music' there isn't a movie in history that has had more genuine and lasting appeal than 'It's A Wonderful Life'.  Also recognized as director Frank Capra's masterpiece, better than fifty years past it's original release the film still garners new fans with every generation in spite of it's sometimes sticky sentimentality and outdated elements.  I have yet to meet anyone who can resist watching it during the Christmas holiday season at least once; I myself dust it off every Christmas Eve without fail and even watch it occasionally in between.

'It's A Wonderful Life' nearly defies anyone to criticize it accomplishing another rare feat in cinema history.  Though director Capra stacks the deck emotionally forcing the tears to well up in our eyes, he keeps the film well balanced with equal moments of humor, memorable true to life characters and even a dreadful nightmarish sequence that culminates with Jimmy Stewart realizing that life is indeed wonderful (""I want to live!"").  Donna Reed and Stewart are the closest thing to perfection as a couple you are likely ever to see in a film; Capra's stock company of gifted and talented actors round out the rest of the cast.  Each of them has an opportunity to shine in both the comedic and the touching moments, though clearly the focus is on Stewart.  Perhaps the most memorable character in the film though is Henry Travers who portrays Clarence Goodbody (""Angel - Third Class."") Stewart's guardian angel; his warmth and charm offer a great contrast during the sequence of Bedford Falls without the benefit of George Bailey's lifeblood flowing through it.  Contrariwise, Lionel Barrymore as the despicable Mr. Potter is also unforgettable - he is the only character that remains unmoved and unchanged by George's predicament and resolution as is demonstrated in the terrific finale.

It's hard to imagine this film being produced today and still manage to have all the qualities present here - just watch (and wince) at the 70's TV movie remake with Marlo Thomas if you doubt me.  All the schmaltz, sentiment and the genuine affection that the characters show for each other would be simply glossed over; in the conclusion Clarence leaves his copy of ""The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer"" for George signing it ""Love"", a scene that I doubt would make it into a movie being made today.  There are many good family and ""feel-good"" movies being made today but they don't begin to compare with this venerable holiday classic.  Here's hoping that Hollywood won't get itchy to do another remake!

Worth noting: in the scene where we are first introduced to Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver the newspaper one of them is reading has a headline that blares SMITH WINS NOMINATION!; I assume this is a sly reference to the earlier Capra and Stewart movie 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'.",1041638400,,2905,4.904081632653061
41961,5,0782010792,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" has become one of those works of art that unfortunately suffers from over exposure. Because everyone and their dog has seen the film eight trillion times (and usually in pathetically rendered public domain prints- more on that later,too many people take this beautiful film for granted.
Suprisingly dark, and hard hitting, Capra as a director pulls very few punches with this, his greatest work. Many have critisized the film as cliched and over sentimental. Maybe that's true, but this film earns all the real emotions it conjures in the audience's eyes. It populates its narrative with animals of all stripes. The irredeemable Mr. Potter is such an example.
Everyone, male and female, adult and child alike, needs to find the beauty in the everyday experience and in the truth that our lives entertwine with all those around us. We cannot expect life to ever be perfect. We often sacrifice our dreams and hopes frequently to the better of those around us. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" stands as a testiment to man's determination to find his/her place in the world. This film is a sterling example of how, no matter how much we would like to fool ourselves into believing the opposite, we are all part of a larger soul, a soul that belongs to everyone (aplogies to John Steinbeck).
Capra's characters are filled with rage, lust, doubt, sadness, temptation. He also fills them with temperance, love, forgiveness and faith. Every character in this film is fully three drawn and complex.
Perhaps no character more so than Jimmy Stewart's everyman, George Bailey. Simply put, George Bailey is one of the all time greatest performances ever put on film. George's complete and utter evololution from gangly teenager to redeemed adult and everything in between stands as a perfect example of film acting. Stewart's performance is as well rounded, shaded and empathetic as anything Brando ever did. Stewart literally opens himself up with a straighrazor in this film and gives his audience complete and full access to his (and therefore, our) very soul(s). Stewart proves with this film, that he was America's consumate leading man (Denzel Washington has perhaps come the closest to taking his place).
The cinematography radiates in vivid detail throughout this gloriously remastered DVD. For all of those who have strained to watch this film through the scratches and poor contrast over the years, this DVD is one of the great Christmas presents. The silver, black and white photography looks as if Ansel Adams himself had decided to chuck the Southwest in favor of switching places with Norman Rockwell. Capra's sense of framing really shines throughout.
Along with ""American Beauty"" (the subtle, but present similarities are astounding!)""It's a Wonderful Life"" stands as one of the most beautiful portrayals of Human life. It remains as fresh the 100th viewing as it does the first. A true proof of a work of art.",1041206400,5,2929,5.041237113402062
41962,1,0782010792,"This is the story of an ambitious young man with dreams of leaving his small town, but due to circumstances beyond his control, has to stay there the rest of his life. His savings and loan has to constantly help out the poor inhabitants, who seem incapable of either earning or saving money. At the first sign of financial trouble, all the dear friends that George has helped out demand their money back. George is such a poor businessman that at the prospect of missing ONE payment to Potter his business will go backrupt and he is prepared to kill himself. Then a angel shows up and convinces George that his miserable life has at least made OTHERS happy.
In a cruel irony, George is forced to accept hand-outs from the townsfolk he helped out. If they had this money, why did they need the loans in the first place?",1040601600,13,818,4.46
41963,5,0782010792,"That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Arguably, one of the best films of all time, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the biography of the fictional character George Bailey who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  Like so many people in real life, George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), aspired to become something greater than what the town of Bedford Falls could offer.  However, unforeseen circumstances prevent him from realizing his childhood dreams and lock him squarely into the life of Bedford Falls that he had so desperately wanted to escape.  In midlife, George (Jimmy Stewart) is barely able to provide adequate food and shelter to his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and their four children.  Further, he is falsely accused of embezzlement and threatened with imprisonment following an absentminded error committed by his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) by his unscrupulous rival, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).
Having faced so many disappointments, the boy who planned to travel the world and become an architect to skyscrapers and bridges instead becomes the manager of the lowly Bailey Savings & Loan and views himself as a complete failure.  Seeing no other viable options in his disillusioned state, George goes to a bridge crossing a wide river and contemplates suicide.  Just as he's ready to take his own life, he hears a splash and pleas for help rising from the river below.  Instinctively, George jumps in, not to kill himself, but to save the individual who had fallen.  The man that George saves, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), is not a man, but a guardian angel sent to save him.  Doubting the existence of angels, George states his wish that he had never been born because he believes everyone would have been better off without him.  Seeing an opportunity to help George, Clarence grants George his wish and creates an alternate reality in which no George Bailey ever existed.  Not realizing that reality changed, George decides to return to Bedford Falls, but instead finds the renamed and sordid community of Pottersville.
As George walks the now unfamiliar streets of Pottersville, George sees nothing but nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  He searches for his business, the Bailey Savings & Loan, but he is told by a stranger that it closed years ago after George's father died and his Uncle Billy had been unable to manage it.  The two men who had been his best friends, the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond), don't know George at all.  He convinces Ernie to take him to what had once been his home, but now is only an abandoned house in total disrepair.  George has no wife and his children don't exist.  In this altered reality, the woman who had been his mother (Beulah Bondi) is an embittered childless widow.  Her only son Harry died as a child when he drowned in a frozen lake because George had not been there to save him.  With no Harry to join the navy, several sailors drown because Harry had not been there to save them and could not become a decorated war hero.  Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) who had once owned a drugstore where George had worked as a child in the other reality, was now only a homeless alcoholic because he had accidentally poisoned a patient when he prescribed the wrong medication.  George had not been there to stop it.  Finally, the woman who had been his wife, Mary Hatch, is in the alternate reality only a lonely spinster.
In desperation, George returns to the bridge where he had once planned to commit suicide and pleads for his life to God and to Clarence.  A light snow begins to fall as it had been in the familiar reality.  Officer Bert, who has been looking for George (and not trying to arrest him as he had in the alternate reality), recognizes George to George's astonishment and relief. He runs home to find Mary waiting for him and no longer cares about the threat of imprisonment, but Mary has made many phone calls in his absence. Nearly everyone in town collects more than enough money to make up for the $8000 that Uncle Billy had absentmindedly lost.
""It's a Wonderful Life"" earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor, Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Having watched it many times, I am frequently brought to tears by the film's powerful drama and emotion.  George's self-sacrifices for Bedford Falls are not overlooked by its citizens who rally to help him. Clarence earns his wings for his efforts; a bell hung on the Bailey Christmas tree rings with George's youngest daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) saying, ""Teacher says that whenever a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.""  George replies, ""That's right. That a-boy Clarence!""
""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a timeless classic that has delighted many generations since its release in 1946.  If you have never seen it, don't be dissuaded because it was filmed in black and white.  Instead, try it and don't be surprised if you find yourself holding back tears like so many others touched by its powerful drama.  As Clarence says, ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around it would leave an awful hole.""",1039564800,,5268,4.814650388457269

Well a little overstated maybe but we do in fact cause ripples in the fabric of our civilization.

was nominated for. George Bailey (James Stewart) is just a ordinary small town man who when he was a child he had dreams of being famous and building things and travel around the world. Through life's events he never sets foot outside of Bedford Falls. On Christmas Eve, c. 1945, he becomes depressed that he fears he has misplaced $8000 to pay off a defecit. The meanest man in town, Henry F. Potter who tried to ruin George all his life, won't help him at all. George came crawling to the wrong person. George makes an attempt at suicide, but is saved thanks to his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody A-S-2 (angel second class). He shows George who wishes he had never been born at all, what life and the town would be without him. Things are different in multiple ways. It drives George crazy, until he can't take it any longer and asks for his life back. It almost brings a tear to your eye when George is sobbing on the bridge and says ""Please, God, let me live again."" Bert the cop finds him and George he realizes Bert knows him, his mouth is bleeding and finds everything the way it was before, and realizes how happy he was and how many lives he touched and just about everything wouldn't be the same without him. He really did have a wonderful life! His wife and childhood friend, Mary (Donna Reed) arranges all of George's friends, quite a whole lot, to help George out.

Frank Capra's endearing classic is the ultimate feel-good movie, like a sip of hot chocolate to warm the throat following a festive night under the stars looking at lights.  All of us readily identify with George Bailey, a common man with big dreams and grand expectations.  But when George's life consistently fails to meet his expectations, he becomes more disillusioned, disappointed.  If only he could have traveled the world, designed and built the skyscrapers and bridges he talked about as a boy, his life would be meaningful.
And then George faces the ultimate conflict:  possible bankruptcy, scandal, and imprisonment.  He contemplates what, quite frankly, many of us would contemplate at such a time--suicide.  Instead, he is given the ultimate gift:  a chance to see what life would be like had he never been born.  What he sees is bleak, even hopeless, and suddenly George realizes:  his life has been meaningful, all along.  And the majestic magnitude of his life is manifested during the film's final scene, when George's family and friends embrace him and rush to his aid.
James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore lead an exceptional cast in this wondrous film.  Released in 1947, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a timeless classic that will be just as entertaining in 2047 and all the years to follow.

Does this sound corny to you? Too bad - its the truth! This film is a magical, healing, life-affirming journey for the viewer. It's a rare collaboration of good film craft, direction and talent and something more - the 'whole' is greater than the sum of parts - the film has captured a sympatico between actors that has yielded 'something elusive and extraordinary'.
Remake it to bring in younger audiences? Would you remake the Beatles work - or Marvin Gaye or Ella Fitzgerald or Edith Piaf? Would you remake Casablanca - perhaps replace Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman? Of Course Not! Nor can you replace Jimmy Stewart, who more than acts in the leading role - he brings in the essence of himself - who he was, what he valued. No one else could top his performance.

A  man is framed by the local capitalist in Bedford Falls who wants to put his hands on the business this man manages to the sole benefit of his clients. His whole life was a fight against injustice, against greed, against inhuman capitalists who consider other men as mere toys on their chessboard. He is led to the envy to commit suicide. But God sends an angel to save him. The method is simple : grant his wish, temporarily, not to have been born. And we have a trip in this society the way it would be if the greedy capitalist, Mr Potter, had not had our hero as a fighting counterpart. The vision of this would-be world is drastic and absolutely dramatic. The worse sides of every man have found the proper environment to prosper and build an unethical world especially by expelling all those who had a moral sense. He then has the possibility to go back to his real life and he discovers that he can escape bankrupcy and all it means for his clients thanks to his friends, nearly the whole population of Bedford Falls who give him the little money thay can find for him to go through this difficult situation and prevent Mr Potter from putting his claws on the city. Capitalism is a fighting tool for those who want to unite against greed and to join forces and will to promote a better world. This trick of seeing what the world would be if the greedy had the upper hand was used in many other films, for one the Back to the Future trilogy. This film is also a tremendous boost for those who doubt the outcome of their fight against immoral powerful people : fight and fight again and never forget that  no man is a failure who has friends . It is true it is hard at times to see it, but yet any rockbottom despair is not worth dying since it would give an easy victory to the immoral band of people who take advantage of capitalism to impose their will and greed over the whole world.

The screenplay of It's a Wonderful Life originated with a Christmas card short story called ""The Greatest Gift"" by Philip Van Doren Stern.  It revolves around the life of George Bailey, an ordinary man who falls in love, gets married, has a family, and unselfishly works hard to support his family and local community.  Deep down George has the itch to escape the chains of the small town atmosphere of Bedford Falls and the family business.  He longs to travel the world in search of adventure, and has visions of constructing grand buildings.  His dreams however are anchored by reality: He feels morally bound to honor his commitments to his family and the family business ""Bailey Building and Loan"".  The first three quarters of the movie slowly builds up atmosphere, as we come to understand George Bailey's character and outlook on life.

It is only towards the very end that the moment of crisis comes: On the eve of Christmas, precisely as a bank inspector is on the scene, a huge sum of money is lost by the bank, and George's entire business is threatened.  At this point the lengthy build-up bears rich fruits: as viewers we are now in a position to understand the incredible and painful frustration George feels.  We share the hurt and disillusionment of this broken man as he snaps at his family and loved ones, and tears well up as his uncomprehending children pray desperately for their father.  It is the slow build up that enables us to share his and their emotions of grief, sorrow, pain and frustration.

When George is at the end of his road, he selfishly considers suicide.  At this point heaven answers the prayers of his family by sending a guardian angel second class (AS2) named Clarence to help George renew his perspective on life.  When George in his depressed state is convinced that the world would have been better off without him, the angel offers him ""a chance to see what the world would be like without you.""  His magical heavenly touch transforms the world to the place it would have been without George Bailey's touch, so that George can discover that ""each man's life touches so many other lives.""

The religious aspect is not convincing: Bailey receives divine aid even though he professes himself not to be a religious man, whereas the Bible portrays heavenly help as a gift for believers.  The notion of a guardian angel as presented in the movie is especially weak, particularly because of the way it often functions for comic relief in a rather trite and disrespectful manner.  Spiritual matters hardly receive the serious treatment they deserve.  In the end, religion (represented by the guardian angel) functions more as a backdrop and literary device to examine a serious perspective on life.  It's a flimsy and unconvincing backdrop, but the matters that the guardian angel as a literary device serves to reflect on are serious indeed.  By being given the opportunity to imagine he had not existed, George Bailey is confronted with the value of life, even a hard and difficult life, and learns that every person can make a difference.  As George reflects on all his blessings, and the impact he has been able to have on people's lives, he comes to the conviction ""I want to live again.""  Clarence reinforces George's desire to live:  ""You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.  Don't you think it's a mistake to throw it away?""  Life is valuable particularly when it is used in selflessness (represented by Bailey) and not in selfishness (represented by Potter).  When serving others instead of mammon, life is tremendously valuable, even though it may be hard.

Though religion is outwardly present in the form of the guardian angel, this affirmation of the value of human life has been stripped of any religious notions.  And yet this self-reflection is itself a very religious one.  It is too bad that the movie succumbs to the need to have a feel-good ending where George overcomes his troubles, because it results in a overly sentimental feel-good Christmas without the Christ-child.  In that sense the movie falls short by not being sufficiently religious.  The reality is that the lives of most viewers do not receive the magical solution that George receives, and that their troubles are ongoing - and only the gospel gives life a wonderful significance in the midst of ongoing troubles.  By providing an overly sweet ending, the theme of ""do good to others"" is unchained from the gospel, and an opportunity was lost to convey a message even more profound.

But even so, the message conveyed is still profound and enduring: Life is wonderful, particularly when it is lived in selflessness for others.  We might not all touch as many lives as George does, but we can all have a tremendous impact in the lives of others.  Unlike so many contemporary movies, It's a Wonderful Life does not promote materialism, greed or immorality, but shows the joys and rewards of a simple and self-less life with family and friends.  The concept is brilliant, and we are left to reflect for ourselves what the lives of our family and friends would be like without our touch.  Not only does this movie provide enduring and powerful themes affirming the value of marriage, family and self-less human life, but it does so with warm humor and touching romance.  Most importantly there is powerful emotion and lasting quality that has the capacity to renew your perspective on your own life.  What more could you ask for?  Few movies are worth watching more than once, but this is certainly one of them! You only live once, but watching this movie once or more might just improve that life you only have the opportunity to live once. - GODLY GADFLY",1018310400,5,5870,4.8163672654690615

Now, back to the film. You can notice that not all of this movie takes place on Christmas. It's good to see year round. The opening sequence is, of course, when George Bailey (ha, got his name) was a boy, and he saves Harry from drowning to death in frigid waters. Then he attends the graduation dance (I'm sure some of you teens and young adults as well as people of all ages will never forget that night.) He falls in love with a girl named Mary, they get married, (I warn you, don't try some of the antics he does.) and George becomes a banker. His business runs short on money and he tries all he can to get it booming again, with a few obstacles along the way. On account of a guardian angel, George gets to see what the town would be like without him (Hey man, why wish that in the first place?  NEVER feel discouraged.)  But it all comes to a happy ending, with the full company on screen.

41981,5,0782010792,"I expect you have seen this before and just want a copy to own. If you haven't seen it, you will be told it is a somewhat sentimental tale of how a man discovers what other people's lives could have been like if he had never lived, courtesy of an angel. But this is not quite right. There is a small amount of sentiment in the film, and it may well leave you teary eyed, but that isn't the whole story. The first three-quarters of the film are spent building the story of George's life from childhood to mid-forties, showing how he met his wife, helped save the family business, the town, and his brother's life along the way. There are moments here when Stewart shows his full acting range, with the kind-hearted character he usually plays prone to moments of anger, impatience and cruelty. This is not a fairy-tale for Christmas, this is real life, otherwise why would George feel so wretched that he would want to kill himself. Notably the villain of the piece goes unpunished at the end of this film, a far cry from a cosy morality tale, and again more like real life.
But it is perhaps the last half hour which is prominent in most people's minds, the charming apprentice angel Clarence only has a quarter of the screen time yet is remembered as fondly as Stewart himself by many viewers. This is one to watch every Christmas. Just like A Christmas Carol, it never gets old and I am sure that new generations will fall under its spell just as we have.

Well, I have been depriving myself all these years from enjoying a cinematic masterpiece.  A movie made in another time period, about something that is hardly out of date -- the worth-fullness of our own lives, and the optimism and hope that comes from knowing that we do make a difference.
But as sappy as this topic could be in the hands of a lesser writer/director, Frank Capra puts it into an engaging story that we can all relate to.  Now I know why this is a yearly tradition in American households.  We need this movie.  Only if to remind us of how valuable we each are.

41984,5,0782010792,"I love this movie and it's a Christmas tradition to watch it with as many of my five kids as I can get together. It has helped me through some pretty tough times.
As a young boy in the 50s and 60s I grew up watching old movies on television with my mother. Jimmy Stewart has always been my favorite actor, not in any small measure because of this movie. It was my mother's fondness for him that initially led me to this great discovery. Having my own roots in a small community of western Pennsylvania, only 60 miles from Jimmy's hometown, helped to cement my affinity for him as well. I'm such a big fan of both him and this work that a copy of an original poster for this film hangs in my living room.
One of my greatest regrets is that, despite my exposure to what were even then ""old"" movies during my youth, I hadn't yet seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" when I had the opportunity of meeting both director Frank Capra AND actor Jimmy Stewart on separate occasions while in college. I would have liked to have told them how much the movie meant to me. (As if they hadn't heard that before!) I found great pleasure in later learning that both Capra and Stewart said of all their movies, this one was their favorite.
Moving and inspiring the film is a human drama that touches my funny bone and my innermost senses in ways few movies ever do. It's an all-American timeless classic with a message of personal struggle and hope. In all it's simplicity it is simply great entertainment while at the same time leaving us no doubt as to the essential truth of what's *really* important in life.
Yes it's a bit sappy, certainly sentimental. Yes it's in black and white (unless you happen to see the ""colorized "" version) and granted it's an ""oldie,"" but if you don't like this movie I can only have pity for you.
We all matter. We all have purpose. Despite what we might think at times, it IS a wonderful life and we have much to be thankful for.

41985,5,0782010792,"Nobody's poor who has friends. This is the moral of this movie, one of the happiest and best ever made. A story of looking at our lives, not at the bad, but the good. Of discovering how we have affected others.
Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, a resident of Bedford Falls, who doesn't realize that he has affected so many people's lives in good ways. He mostly concerns himself with the present, which at the time isn't good. He has run into debt problems with his father's Savings and Loans building and attempts suicide. It's up to an angel named Clarence to save George and convince him he's led a good life.
Throughout his life, George was always a thorn in the side of Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the owner of about everything in town except for the Bailey Loans building. George gave up going to college or around the world just so he could run the building. In this, he prevented Potter from taking over and being able to charge whatever rent he wanted and thus ripping off the people of Bedford Falls by having them live in rundown slums. But George's life was much more than that. If it weren't for him, the lives of his brother, the owner of a store (Who George worked for), of his wife and of about everyone in town would be very different.
It is indeed difficult to review a movie like this, what with thousands of words already said about it. While there was some sappiness in it, particulary the ending, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It can cheer you up because it makes us think about all the good things we have done. Than again, if we have lead a bad life like Mr. Potter, it won't make us too happy.
George Bailey may not have been as financially wealthy as Potter. But because he was friends with practically the whole town, he was very much wealthier. Okay, so in real life the whole town probably would not give George all their money just so he could be out of debt. But it certainly makes you think. Enjoy!",1009411200,5,1944,4.402777777777778
41986,5,0782010792,"When I think of words to describe Frank Capra's masterpiece ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" only one word comes to mind: greatness. Greatness in its storytelling, which embodies the traditions and values of an American era gone by... greatness in its ability to generate some of the most complex characters in movie history from the simplest of human themes... greatness in its sense of heartfelt emotion and true knowledge of what life is really all about. Here is a movie that merits multiple viewings with each new holiday season, leaving its mark on each new generation while giving those familiar with it another chance to experience the magic.
People are most often surprised by the history of the film, which opened to moderate business at the box office, yet failed to muster the excitement and audience embracement that modern viewers have so lovingly bestowed upon it. Due to the weather, many people remained in their homes, while many who ventured to the bistro billed the film as too depressing for the Christmas season. And so, like a snowflake in the winter breeze, Frank Capra's slice-of-life film came and went like most modern movies of today.
Perhaps if its copyright had been renewed, we may never have known the true heart of this magnificent film, which has since become a traditional part of the holidays for many who revere the film as a classic; to bill it as anything but such is an injustice. The film has earned its popularity through its virtue and heartfelt emotional core, telling a story that serves as a model for humankind as well as a striking portrait of some of our country's most darkest days.
The story, originally a short story in the form of a Christmas card which was purchased by RKO Pictures for ten thousand dollars, takes us to the small town of Bedford Falls, where life is simple and people are filled with high spirits despite their hardships. At the center of this is George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of the towering screen performances of all time; George has lofty ambitions that include ""seeing the world, building skyscrapers 1000 stories high,"" and ""a bridge a mile long."" His idealistic view of the outside world is constantly put on hold, as he struggles to upkeep his deceased father's building and loan company, which is in danger of going under.
It may not appear so at first, but as the movie progresses, we can see just how much George does for his fellow man. He keeps the building and loan going as an outlet for those who have little or nothing to begin a better life without having to turn to Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore), ""the richest and meanest man in the county"" who sees fit to keep the citizens of Bedford Falls under his rule. But George will not allow it, and so, with the help of his newly-acquired wife, Mary (Donna Reed), and his business partner, his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), he struggles to keep the town alive, ignoring his own dreams and aspirations for the greater good, never realizing the full impact he has on his fellow man until he is given a frightening glimpse of what may have been had he never been born at all, compliments of angel Clarence Oddbody, played by Henry Travers with real wit and acting ability.
Through all of this, George's life is shown in various lights, from the happiest moments a man could ever wish for, to the darkest depths of depression from which every man spends much of his life running from. This is why Capra's film succeeds so enormously: one minute we are in the murkiest recesses of life, as George searches frantically for a way out of his troubles. Through Capra's direction and Stewart's brilliant acting, much of this third act is infused with sheer terror that still manages to evoke chills, as he discovers what his absence would have meant to the people he met in his life. And then, after the realization that running from one's hardships provides no solace, he returns from his nightmare to discover his life in a completely different light, armed with the knowledge that ""no man is a failure who has friends.""
The overall film itself is a wonderful mosaic of American life at its most jubilant and its most downtrodden. As George grows up, from a small boy working in a drug store, to an ambitious college-bound teenager struck by love when he lays eyes on his future wife, we bear witness to some of the landmarks of our nation's history, from a Charleston contest at a high school dance, to the Great Depression and World War II. Each character is affected by these events, yet their upbeat demeanor in the face of these trying times magnificently captures the human resolve, and we come to care for all of them a great deal more.
And just as Capra is working his magic behind the camera, his wonderful and now-landmark cast works much of their own onscreen. Stewart's performance is one of history's most memorable, and will not soon be forgotten so long as the film remains in our hearts. Donna Reed evokes a warm and caring nature as Mary, sharing a terrific bond with Stewart that makes the marriage between their two characters affectionate and loving, not to mention totally convincing. Thomas Mitchell's eccentric and frantic Uncle Billy is supplied with heart, while each supporting actor offers humor and heartfelt emotion to the town's most notable citizens. Barrymore, too, plays the miserly Mr. Potter with supreme and delectable nastiness, one of Hollywood's most memorable villains.
Despite a less-than-favorable history, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has reached its broad audience to find a home in everyone's hearts, with its wonderful storytelling, instantly likeable characters, and warm message about life. It takes risks in that it doesn't hide the hardships from view, but rather shows them in a most eerie and frightening manner, and this juxtaposition of gloom and happiness is the movie's biggest success. That, and its status as a great American film, a timeless classic which keeps us coming back for another slice of George Bailey's life each holiday season.",1009324800,10,6030,4.810211946050097

This film has become such a Holiday fixture I think it's easy to lose sight of just what he did in this film.  It's an amazing performance, so full of honesty and emotion.  It's perhaps one of the most real performances ever given on film, and it certainly stands the test of time.  I've read the original story that this film was based on, and as good as it is, the film surpasses it.  It's an excellent adaptation, fleshing out the characters more and adding so much more conflict and detail.  The supporting cast is terrific, with such reliable actors as Lionel Barrymore, Beulah Bondi, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, and of course, the wonderful Henry Travers.

All I want to say is that, if there ever was a time for families to sit down and enjoy this film, now is the time. I've always come away with something whenever I've watched this film. It makes me think more about my family and loved-ones, and how at times I may avoid them, or say harsh things. ""It's A Wonderful Life"", after now, just over 50 years, still has the power to do that to me! If that alone is not enough to call this a great film, well, then there's James Stewart's performances. How at the time of release this film did not manage to sweep the Oscars is beyond. If Stewart doesn't get you to pull for him by the very end of the film, then I'm just the biggest fool walking around. You actually honestly start to care not only about him, but his family as well. If someone can tell me, they don't get a little misty at the end, when everyone comes to George Bailey's house with the money the town has collected, then you just have no heart.

Jimmy Stewart has one of the most engaging roles of his career as George Bailey, the hometown hero who has big dreams, but gives them up for doing the right thing. Younger children may not be able to appreciate the depth of this film, but when we watched a showing of this film at a local theatre, my younger brother actually enjoyed it.

41996,5,0782010792,"Capra manipulates his audience from the first scene. This is not a think for yourself film, not something like Citizen Kane, that is supposed to have the audience leave the theatre already in various discussions or even quarrels.
I remember showing this film every winter in an art house when I was in college; afterwards I'd lean out the transom to look over the seats and I'd see the lines of used Kleenex strewn up and down the rows. This is exactly what Capra intended, and he has succeeded.
Ironically, it is the jaded audiences of America since the Vietnam War that have embraced this film. When it first came out in 1947, the critics panned it. World War Two had just ended, and the critics, as well as the typical audiences wanted something besides a plain old feel-good movie. It was all very nice that George Bailey ""suffered"" a mediocre middle class life, so that he could save the lives of his brother, and by him, ""the men on the transport,"" not to mention the kid with the diphtheria. But this didn't answer any of the questions on people's minds at the time.
Right after World War Two, people were dealing with war orphans, and the influx of refugees from concentration camps. 1947 was just about the time that America was coming to terms with what has gone on in places like Buchenwald and Treblinka. Not to mention Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
I think the irony is in the fact that the recent audiences have been able to put aside questions of My Lai, the Bay of Pigs, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, The Gang of Four, the Iranian Embassy hostages, Tiannamen Square, the Taliban, Tibet, and focus on the idea that a man is wealthy as long as he has friends. Why is this possible, when contemporary audiences didn't respond to the film?
I suppose modern audiences respond with nostalgia, to the old black & white film, with its boxy cars, wind up record player, and corner drugstore. Yes, well, we have the Taliban now, and back then there were no jumbo jets, or buildings tall enough for a flying plane....
The truth is that every time has hard times, and no days were simpler. But nonetheless, this is a great film. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed take stock characters and flesh them out, so that the audience cares what happens to them from the moment they appear on the screen.
The photography makes the film. The filming and editing are superb. If you have a chance to buy a letterboxed version of the film, do, because it loses so much with the sides cropped off. There are a number of deep-focus shots, and odd angles, designed to show George Bailey from G-d's perspective, or to emphasise the times he is alone in a crowd, or to jolt the audience, to make us uncomfortable and nervous when George Bailey is uncomfortable and nervous. Or sometimes just to give an eye-catching view, as when George holds his hands out before receiving his trunk and says ""I want a BIG one!""
The crew and the actors have given such close attention to detail, that the film stands up to multiple viewings, so you won't be sorry you bought instead of rented.",1006300800,2,3054,4.564663023679417

41999,5,0782010792,"This is the kind of story that transcends all generations and ages and speaks to each individual.  It is associated with the Christmas holidays and rightly so.  Yet the movie's story about a good man who is frustrated with his life to the point of suicide speaks as loudly today as it did in 1947.
Some critics of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" call it ""Capracorn"" (making reference to the movie's director, Frank Capra), and say that it is unrealistic sentiment, but I disagree.  The story basically shows how a man's life unfolds through a period of years in the town in which he was born.  What he thinks are disappointments and cruel tricks of fate actually lead him to the place he always wanted to be.  He is shown what the lives of his loved ones and friends would have been like had he never been born.  He realizes that those small acts of kindness and love that he has given to people were not insignificant, but made major differences in each and every life.
Particularly moving is the scene where the protagonist, George Bailey, superbly played by Jimmy Stewart, prays a silent, but desparate prayer in the town bar.  The answer to that prayer gives George Bailey some unexpected twists and turns, but shows the fabric of his life is so carefully interwoven with those he loves and cares for.
This is American filmaking at its very finest.  I highly reccomend this for the whole family.",1005523200,7,1391,4.603238866396761
42000,3,0782010792,"I suppose that, the first time one watches this rather excessively sweet film, even the most hardened cynic would shed a tear at the ending, when George is revealed as one who has a matchless wealth of friends and support. James Stewart indeed portrays George Bailey superbly, but I found that, beyond the first viewing, this becomes rather an annoying film.

Of course, the contrast between George (the sort of man anyone would like on sight, and love all the more with acquaintance), and the dreadful Potter, who makes the pre-converted Ebenezer Scrooge look cuddly, provides much of the action - trouble is, the premise really is not that realistic. The idea that being good-natured, and having a spirit of self-sacrifice that goes from heroic to excessive, benefits one's community is taken to too great an extreme. The Baileys are always on verge of bankruptcy, yet manage to be the saviours of all of the rather poor people who want to fulfil the mid-century dream of owning their own homes. Intending no blasphemy, I found it annoying that George becomes something of a Christ figure... yet never is allowed to think of himself or his family in the process.

George seems a wonderful man, but it became difficult to see his as a ""wonderful life."" It seemed that everyone was entitled to fulfil their dreams except George... indeed, that he had to make certain that he sacrificed every aspiration (college, honeymoon trip, travelling) entirely so someone else could have them. Considering how, when George sees what the town would be like had he never lived, everyone is in miserable straits, the 'saviour' business is rather macabre, as are the people resident in Bedford Falls!

Romantic though I am at heart, the cynical part of me sighed, knowing full well that, no matter how good anyone was to others, the first accusation of embezzlement would be more likely to make the others think, ""now we know how he really is!"" Miserable though Potter is, it does not ring true that one with his resources could be totally unsuccessful in acquiring potential homeowners as customers because a good-hearted, impoverished sort simply was more pleasant.

Certainly, watch this once... but don't go back for repeated viewings, since the memory of the first viewing will be far more pleasant than the cloying effects of repeat performances.",1004486400,9,2337,4.954081632653061

42002,5,0782010792,"I'd prefer not to echo the praise this film receives from seemingly everyone, but I've always been fascinated by its continuing, and growing, appeal to modern audiences....so I suppose the next few echoes you hear will just be me, throwing somebody else's two cents in.
The Bedford Falls of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has never really existed - that's hardly a news flash. Bedford Falls is childhood and innocence tucked away in the safe harbor of the past, a deeply comforting fantasy composed of equal portions of wish-fulfillment and nostalgia: a fantasy which summons our better angels, lifting us out of dog-eat-dog mundanity and towards a picture-postcard version of the Ideal. It's this first half of IAWL that chafes against the jaded postmodern sensibility that seeks always to justify and celebrate aberrance, even evil, in the name of 'understanding'; a generation whelped on wrestling, gangsta-rap, South Park and Howard Stern (all of which get brushed under the rug as 'harmless fun') is hardly likely to respond to Capra's idealistic Everytown with anything beyond bemused contempt. The second half - the dark, slightly creepy, Twilight Zone portion of the film - exerts a far more seductive pull on modern moviegoers. Well, let's face it, Pottersville is what contemporary America IS; it's what people have gotten used to, at least, in many cases convincing themselves is preferable to some candyass Norman Rockwell never-neverland. (Because it's 'real', you see; and consistent with this ghetto existentialism, harsh & ugly 'reality' trumps every other kind.) Has anyone ever noted that while Bedford Falls is obviously a studio creation, the camera pans across the nightmarish neon marquees dotting Pottersville might be stock footage of any postwar American city? That contrast, that wrenching emotional dichotomy, is what strikes such a chord within those of us who love this film without reservation, as does Capra's message in IAWL: that Bedford Falls is within reach of us all if we love our friends and family, stay the course despite setbacks, treat others with kindness and respect...and believe in God.
The simple key that unlocks this film is belief in God; having steadfast faith in a benevolent Higher Power which views each human life as precious & important. Capra & Stewart were both troubled by currents of cynicism making strong inroads into American life after WW2, particularly wanting to combat a creeping purposelessness they saw as rooted in atheism (which always becomes fashionable after wartime). Though not made as a Xmas attraction per se (not a single depiction of clergy in the entire damn film!), IAWL promotes a belief in God as the vital glue of conscience, family, community, nation  - without which all our Bedford Falls would be inevitably subsumed into Pottersvilles. Give Capra credit for managing to impart this message subtly, despite all the angels, answered prayers and celestial voice-overs he has woven into the story fabric. (Maybe TOO subtly, as the movie tanked on first release, eventually tumbling into the public domain.) Though lately such strong endorsement of religious faith is considered cultural anathema (at least according to the empty suits running film studios), nevertheless IAWL now seems impossible to resist to audiences unceasingly bludgeoned with entertainment built upon callousness, carnality and previously-unthinkable levels of brutality. (Which is why the notion of a remake is utterly laughable: even teenagers who don't 'get' old black & white movies are intuitive enough to grasp that this kind of deep-rooted sentiment properly belongs to a different America - the America contemporary Hollywood has taught them to despise.)
Though everyone rightfully focuses on Jimmy Stewart's truly stunning performance as George Bailey, it's worth noting that this might be Capra's finest hour as a filmmaker. There's no exotica a la LOST HORIZON or showy MR SMITH filibusters on view; WONDERFUL LIFE is more introspective and mellow a film, Capra in a muted key. But every setpiece is staged and photographed expertly, and all the big payoffs resonate with honest and powerful emotion. The scene with young George Bailey and the drunken, grief-crazed druggist is as beautifully done as any in Capra's long career, and that's just the first of many high points here: the lovingly-shot nostalgia of the farewell dance; George & Mary's tentative, slowly-building love scene as they share a phone call from a friend; the sick, shamed look of helplessness on George's face directly following his violent tantrum in front of his kids. All are indelible moments that cling to your memory for a lifetime, and Capra seems to have been saving them all up for this movie. Yet perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the film is the inability of film critics - otherwise at a loss to explain its strong hold over an increasingly secular public - to resist 'interpreting' it for the new millenium. Thus, the endless 'cutting-edge' bromides one reads that patiently explain how IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a 'dark' film with a pessimistic view of American middle-class aspirations & values...even an indictment of them! Yet somehow, year after year, millions of viewers faithfully watch it for the umpteenth time, reaffirming those same values, laughing and crying along with George, losing and finding their religion through the proxy of George's suffering and renewal. It took a while for Capra & Stewart's favorite film to finally do what they'd hoped it would - speak to an audience, and help give it faith to believe & strength to abide - but once WONDERFUL LIFE got its bearings and began gathering momentum, not a day goes by that this remarkable movie isn't earning its wings somewhere in the world.",1000080000,4,5762,5.189044038668099

It is probably the most beloved film ever made.  Interestingly, the film was a major flop when it was released in 1946.  It sat around in the vaults as a forgotten movie until it's copyright expired.  The film became public domain and in the time of television, that meant stations could air it without paying for the rights to do so.  Even though it is not a Christmas film, the fact that the movie ending takes place on Christmas, stations aired the film incessantly around the holidays.  The movie became traditional watching for families and has since become so associated with Christmas that one could mark the season with the movie's airing.  The film itself is a morality tale and one of the darkest and disturbing film performances of Jimmy Stewart's career.  We follow the downward spiral of Mr. Stewart's George Bailey.  He has high ideals and wants to travel the world, but ends up doing the right thing by taking over his father's savings and loan business in Bedford Falls.  He world eventually crashes down around him when his Uncle Billy loses an important bank deposit.  George wishes he was never born and an angel Clarence shows him what life would have been like without him.  The moral of the story is that we touch so many people in so many different ways and every person's life is important.

42011,5,0782010792,"A beautifully crafted film that proved to be the apex of triple Oscar-winner (1934, 1936, 1938) Frank Capra's distinguished career, and the epitome of his cycle of works celebrating the ""common man"".  Mr. Deeds found himself suddenly wealthy, Mr. Smith went to Washington as a Senator, and John Doe became the focus of a socio-political movement; but ""Life""'s George Bailey never distinguishes himself outside of his small hometown of Bedford Falls --- his brother Harry is the one who becomes a war hero, and his friend Sam Wainwright is the one who achieves financial success.  George's triumph is simply his personal integrity, his code of ethics, and his strength of character --- his goodness, if you will --- during the unexciting course of his ordinary, mundane existence.  In this respect, George is more an Everyman than any other Capra protagonist, inviting strong audience identification and response.
In one of the most exquisite performances ever given in an American film, James Stewart is superb as George.  It's not an easy role to play because so much screen time is spent focusing on George's subtle reactions to the world around him.  One incredible moment  comes at the train station when George slowly begins to absorb the news of his brother's recent marriage and new career opportunity, and how his brother's fortune will destroy his own hopes of leaving Bedford Falls and the family business.  Stewart's face is extraordinary in this scene, as surprised realization fades into quiet disappointment and finally, gentle graciousness and acceptance.  Stewart's tour de force is given strong support by a superb cast of Capra stalwarts, including Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, H. B. Warner, and the phenomenal Beulah Bondi (as George's mother).  And Donna Reed, in one of her first romantic leading roles after a number of years playing supporting ingenues and bits, is excellent in the warm but unglamorous role of George's loving wife, Mary.
The Republic Home Video DVD is definitely the edition of this classic to own.  Like the LaserDisc before it, the DVD offers a crystal clear, beautifully restored film-to-video transfer  which will amaze and delight anyone who is familiar only with the horrible multi-generational VHS cassettes, or the awful  colorized version, that were commonly screened back in the late 1970's and 1980's.  There are some nice bonus features on the DVD, including a ""making of"" documentary and the theatrical trailer.  This is one DVD that you'll never regret adding to your home theatre collection!
Trivia note:  If you're a fan of this movie, try finding a copy of film historian David Thomson's 1985 novel ""Suspects"" which  continues George's story and relates the characters from this movie to many others (did you know that Donna Reed's ""Mary Bailey"" is actually the sister of Gene Tierney's ""Laura""?!, etc.) ... great fun!",977875200,69,2883,5.167741935483871

42013,3,0782010792,"George Bailey had one dream in life, to get out of the small town of Bedford Falls, see a few new sights, and have a few adventures.  His first shot of this was to be his college years.  This fell through, he stayed in Bedford Falls and his brother had the college career.  Throughout his entire life, every attempt to get away from Bedford Falls, even for a week or two, was thwarted by some business or family responsibility.  The poor guy never even got to go on his own honeymoon!
Others came and went, but not poor old George Bailey.  Finally, on one Christmas Eve, as a result of the chicanery of a nasty old grinch type businessman in town, George's business problems, on top of all of his thwarted ambitions, got so bad and he became so despondent that he was on the verge of suicide.
Along came an angel named Clarence who had been a bit of a failure in his own right.  He'd never been able to earn his wings and his absolute last chance to earn them was to keep Bailey from committing suicide.  In a sort of reverse version of Dickens' tale of Scrooge seeing the ghosts of his past, present, and future, Bailey's angel showed him what miserable lives his (Bailey's) friends and families would have had had there been no George Bailey...
Do you really think that the description of a wonderful life is one in which you never even got a trip around the block and the absolute high point is that you didn't commit suicide?  Doesn't meet my definition.",977011200,11,1458,4.394052044609666

Let me ask one question before we go on.  Who here has not asked the question, ""What if?.  If this is the first movie to deal with this question it certainly is the best.  George (Jimmy Stewart) is not perfect nor is Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) completely evil.  The key difference we get to see George `s life laid out before us and get to see what events it was that shaped him.  What we see is a man feeling so alone so desperate he see no other choice before him until he is reminded what really is important. I really do not need to remind any one, just in case we forget  the really important  things in life are , family friends and  love.  Maybe this movie should not be watched at Christmas because it gets lumped into the ""holiday"" movie stereotype.  It is a fundamental belief  in all of us that we make a difference.

42016,5,0782010792,"How ironic that this once-forgotten and neglected film became by 1990 the most taken-for-granted American movie as a result of multiple screenings on virtually every television channel during the Christmas season.  Now that it's been removed from public domain and its distribution returned to studio control, perhaps we can begin to appreciate once again what an extraordinary film it actually is.
New viewers, especially, have the opportunity to approach the movie not with assumptions about its ""excessive sentimentality"" but to experience the darkness of George Bailey's suicidal descent, without  which the film's ending would not provide such overwhelming relief and celebration of life's ""wonderfulness.""  But prior to this emotional pay-off, we are also first-hand witnesses to much emotional pain.  George's ""surrender"" to Mary, for example, is perhaps the most memorable kiss in all of film because of its violence (he curses and practically strangles her while yielding up his idealistic dreams of personal greatness).  And later when it appears he has transplanted his grandiose visions to Bedford Falls, where he is its proudest citizen, we suddenly see what his pride has led him to: a complacent self-satisfaction so great it can lead him to thoughts of self-destruction over the disappearance of a mere $5000.
More than Scrooge's stinginess or Dante the Pilgrim's sinfulness, George's story reminds us of our own misplaced piorities and their distorted, potentially fatal, consequences.  This is a film that encourages self-examination and affirmation of life like few others.  And because of it's archetypal patterns and complex, rich details of production and performance (it's far more than a ""talking picture""), the film can never be reduced to a mere ""message.""  It invites numerous viewings, each leading to the discovery of fresh, new meanings.

42018,5,0782010792,"This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.
The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.
Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.
Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job.  Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.
This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering ""It's a Wonderful Life"" an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.

The movie has a simple message: No man is a failure if he has friends. My sister keeps asking me through the years, ""Why do you like this movie?"". It's simple. It's about looking out for the little guy, which is what George Bailey does. He did everything he could to keep that building and loan open. He is smart, well-liked, and never thinks about himself. With that, there is no way you can hate George Bailey. He wants his friends and others to have an alternative to Harry Potter (the Lex Luthor of his time).

42025,5,0782010792,"Crystal clarity and outstanding sound quality make this DVD a ""can't miss"" purchase for any Christmas list.  However, the universal themes presented in this film are by ALL MEANS useful for year round multiple viewings.  Try watching it (in all of its glory and elegance) with subtitles as a fresh alternative to the crude and inhospitable language spoken by the gangster hoodlums who have infiltrated today's motion picture industry, and degraded the product in epic proportions.  Watching Stewart being pulled out of the icy water in French is another viable option.  The true icing on the cake is the DVD's primary bonus feature, ""The Making of It's A Wonderful Life"".  This movie provides an unusual glimpse into a common fantasy: What life would be like if you had never been born.  It's about optimism, choices, courage, and also the darker side of human nature.  The subject of suicide is dealt with in a straightforward, hospitable manner.  Stewart as George Bailey is haunted by his negative perception of what lies ahead.  Bailey is down and out, and virtually at the end of his rope.  He desperately feels there is no way out . . .  That is until the distinct possibility of a guardian angel is playfully introduced.  When ""George"" confides to the angel that he is ""going off my nut,"" audiences of the new millennium realize that maybe not all that much has changed in the past sixty or seventy years.  The difference is found most obviously in the hometown feeling and neighborly characters that offer a friendly ""Mom and Pop"" type assistance not found in today's ""Big Box"" atmosphere.  A little known tidbit is that some strange developments occurred following the death of Henry F. Potter (no relation to Harry).  Instead of becoming an angel, he went to hell, and returned as the unsavory recluse who antagonizes a well casted sorority (who encounter infamous misfortunes) in another Holiday classic, ""Black Christmas"".  ""Black Christmas"" presents unthinkable possibilities of what could happen if there are more troubled souls than available guardian angels.  ""Black Christmas"" followed by ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the perfect double movie billing to make any Holiday festivities complete!",970531200,3,2207,5.069252077562327

42027,5,0782010792,"""It's a Wonderful Life,"" starring James Stewart and Donna Reed, did OK, but not super, at the box office in 1947.  Perhaps it was too sentimental.  Nevertheless, this movie has, in the meantime, become one of  the most widely known, most watched and beloved of director-genius Capra's  films.
The premis of the story (just in case you've been off planet for  the past 53 years) is this... What would life be like if someone had never  been born?  What effect does one seemingly insignificant life have on the  lives of others that a person brushes against during their life?  Well, in  this movie George Bailey (played by Stewart) gets the chance to see just  that.  An apprentice angel arranges the whole thing.
I am amazed each  time I watch this film to see how small acts and interactions have major  effects in the lives of others -- family members, et al.
The  Christmas-time setting of this film has certainly contributed to much of  its success and appeal.  That, the hometown feel of the setting, the  next-door neighborly nature of the characters, the story itself, and stars  like Stewart, Reed, and others, make this film a timeless classic.
Is  this film sentimental?  Certainly!  Is it watchable?  Definitely!  Should  you own it?  Absolutely.
5 stars, only because that's the highest rating  possible.

On a side note...you may be interested to  know that biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote a book titled ""Wonderful  Life"" (taken from the title of this film) in which he pulls on a  premis similar to the one in this movie -- the theme is contingency and the  evolution of life.  It's a ""what-if"" question.  What if, for  example, one of a group of animal's ancestors had turned right instead of  left and was killed and left no offspring, then what?  It's an interesting  read about life of the Burgess Shale (Cambrian animal fauna).  If it sounds  interesting, give it a look, it's quite readable.

42028,5,0782010792,"I guess you're all wondering, ""What's this gal doing?  Here it is June and all she can rate are Christmas films.""  And I know I said you couldn't go through Christmas without White Christmas and Miracle on 34th  Street, but here's another one for you.  It's a Wonderful Life is a  wonderful classic about what life would be like if you were never born.  Now I know everybody out there probably wishes at one time or another that  they'd never been born.  ""Why, if I'd never been born, I wouldn't be  going through all this heartache and pain.""  Heartache and pain, or  not, life is always worth living.  If you were never born, what would have  happened to your mom and dad, your brothers and sisters, your husband or  wife.  You would never have had the wonderful children that you hold so  dear.  Maybe you did something in your life that saved the life of someone  precious to you.  If you'd never been born, you could not have done  that.
If George Bailey had never been born, his little brother Harry  would have died when he broke through the ice when he was a child.  He  would not have grown up to save his entire regimen from the enemy during  World War II.
If George Bailey were never born, his mother would have had  to start a boarding house just to make ends meet.
If George Bailey were  never born, his wife Mary would have become an old maid, afraid of her own  shadow and ever shy.
If George Bailey were never born, he would never  have had his beautiful children, and there would have been no petals from  his youngest daughter, Zuzu.
If George Bailey were never born, there  would have been no Clarence the angel to come to Earth to show George just  how much he was needed.  The entire town relied on George.  If George had  not been around, the whole town would have gone to old man Potter and it  would not have been the nice little town it was with George.

42031,5,0782010792,"There seems to be some sort of conspiracy in Australia to keep this film a secret. It is clear to me that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is regarded as the standard Christmas eve broadcasting in the US. It seems  that many Americans regard this film as worn out, in the same way as say  ""The sound of music"" has been, through too many viewings. To the  best of my knowledge it has only been broadcast once in the last ten years  in OZ, (I've been informed that's not strictly true, but why spoil the  story), and that time was not advertised. So perhaps I am in a better  position to judge the true worth of this film, not having been overexposed.  I regard it as one of my top ten of all time. The cast is fabulous. James  Stewart was perfect in his central role as George Bailey. Although I would  rate his performance in ""Mr. Smith goes to Washington"", slightly  higher. The story is brilliant and the direction is immaculate.

I  was lucky enough to get one of the 45th anniversary copies of the  re-mastered laser disc and it is a beautiful transfer. If you ever want to  add this film to your collection, this is the copy to get. If you are not  crying through at least half of this film, both in joy and anguish, then I  think there is something wrong with you. I certainly got more out of this  film than any rendition of Dickens', ""A Christmas Tale"". After  all how many of us can empathize with a penny pinching self centered old  grouch versus a good man faced with letting his family and friends down.

That is the basic story after all. George Bailey has been dealt a  savage blow and is contemplating suicide at his lowest ebb. It takes an  apprentice angel to put it all in perspective and remind him that joy in  life should never be eclipsed by any setback. Maybe those Americans out  there that have not taken the time to watch ""It's a Wonderful  Life"" in the last ten years should stop and try to recall the story.  If you can't, then you should make the time to give it another chance. You  may be surprised at the power it still has to move you.",957657600,5,2059,4.266839378238342
42032,5,0782010792,"I'm a real movie buff and I own many VHS movies but this one ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is my number one favorite. Every Christmas the fam gathers 'round the TV and we watch this flick. In fact, I usually watch it  two or three times during the year. I have yet to watch this movie without  weeping tears of joy. It touches me deeply because the message is so very  powerful and the movie is so well done.
We all *yearn* to think the  world - even our little corner of it - would be the poorer had we not been  born. But this movie paints a dramatic picture of the power of one life to  do good and lift up others and the power of others to lift up one soul  who's lost his way.
The history in this movie is also good. It shows  life in the first 40 years of this century in a very accurate way.
And  in the rush on the bank, George Bailey gives the best definition of a  mortgage I've ever read or heard in any medium.
Interestingly, Hollywood  censors had several concerns with the movie - the villan - Mr. Potter got  away with theft with no serious consequences and when George said  ""nuts to you"" that was considered an unnecessary ugliness.
I  could write on and on about this movie. Like a beautiful gem, it has many  facets and the more you watch this flick, the more you see all it's  beautiful sides.
I suppose the most important message I got out of the  movie is that no circumstance - no matter how dark it may appear - is ever  hopeless.
I loved it.",956880000,4,1460,4.080985915492958
42033,5,0782010792,"One major misconception about It's a Wonderful Life is the nature of exactly what it is George Bailey learns that turns him from death.  It's blatantly obvious to us and to him how important he is to Bedford Falls.  We are made increasingly aware of this as the film progresses.  Clarence  the angel in trying to convince George Bailey how important he is to  everyone, exactly misses the point.  What George finally needs to realize  is how important Bedford Falls, his friends, his wife and family are to  him. This is something in all his fantasies of travel and fame he has never  allowed himself to acknowledge.  Home sickness was not an option.  I  believe this one of the main reasons the story of George Bailey is so  powerful. Self sacrifice alone is not enough.
I have also always been  impressed at just how dark all the undercurrents of this film are, despite  the ""CapriCorn"".  In the end Disaster is averted (for now), but  one imagines Potter will get to keep the money that was the source of  George Bailey's most recent woes, and will remain the threat he ever was.  Attempts to create Light without Dark have spawned the worst kinds of  sentimental trash, but It's a Wonderful Life is decidedly not in that  category.",950572800,4,1235,4.625

James Stewart has this ""Rocky &  Bugsy""-era voice and a vigourous demeanor & Donna Reed is just  brung in to play the hard-to-get young girl and the reserved wife.  My  focus refused to stay entact while watching this movie, but the ideas I did  withdraw from this movie is that George Bailey (James Stewart) is caught in  the tangled web of a financial scandal...  and on the brink of suicide.  That is... until a cliched assigned guardian angel appears out of the sky  and falls in the waters of Bedford Falls... to save George (ironically).  Before this happens, George is on a bridge contemplating (supposedly)  suicide (due partially to a busted-lip from a brute in Martini's bar whose  wife George insulted on the phone, heh heh), and when he sees Clarence (the  ""quote on quote""... angel), he jumps in after him and retrieves  him.  Henceforth, George rebuffs the idea of an angel and wishes he was  never born, and granted... he was never born.  And boy, does he take the  in-your-face gruff reality of having no identity for a sham, but to his  shagrin... it's as serious as a heart attack.  George is a non-existent  would-have-been making a futile attempt to spark some remembrance in his  lost friends & family.  Predictably, George repents and returns to  existance... with a little (or lot of) monetary help from the whole town  for his business trouble (whose lives apparently were impacted greatly by  him somehow).  Upon the saccharine conclusion (where George, his wife,  & kid are basking in the solace of christmas communion), my eyes almost  started to well-spring... I haven't the faintest idea why (I'm only 17).  A  nice retrospective on the golden age of Christmas classics.
