8545233,5,B009YG46XS,"I absolutely love Brit Floyd. Most of the current members played with the Australian Pink Floyd. In 2010, I believe, Damian Darlington left to form the incredible Brit Floyd with their first performance in 2011. I bought this, not because I have an interest in Aussie Pink Floyd, but because Damian was playing with them in this show. I'm so glad I purchased this DVD!",1440806400,,368,4.676923076923077
