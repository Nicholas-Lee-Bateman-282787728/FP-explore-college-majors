8495105,2,B00695KVQS,"My three year old son loves Mike the Knight, so when I saw Amazon had the DVD I ordered it for him . We were very disappointed when the DVD arrived. The DVD was Region 2 and since we live in the US we needed Region 1 but Amazon does not have Region 1. I have tried several time to find a Region 1 DVD for him but no luck so far. It is hard to explain to a child why the DVD does not work, they do not under stand Regions , the only thing that they understand is that their DVD does not work.",1346630400,22,491,3.641509433962264
