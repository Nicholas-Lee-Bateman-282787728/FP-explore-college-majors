3035115,3,B000YQP57I,"""The Impossible Kid"" is Weng Weng's follow up to ""For Your Height Only"" in the otherworldly genre of Filipino dwarf karate flicks. The filmmakers are openly exploiting Weng Weng's small stature (I hope he was well-paid for this,) but this is a very unusual type of film with an unusual target audience. The film features a laughable plot, utterly hilarious dubbing (please note the intermittent cacophony of fiendish laughs,) terrible acting and direction, and is derivative of just about every movie ever made, but at the end of the day everyone is here to see Weng Weng pole vault, walk a tightrope, and run around Manila on his scooter. You will be pleased to know he does all this and much, much more, including an underwater escape from a parakeet cage (!) but I'm getting ahead of myself.

The film spares no time in getting into the action with Weng Weng rappelling down a high rise, a little something I like to call ""the peeping Weng Weng scene."" I had no idea so many women in the Philippines showered in their underwear. Following this illicit intelligence-gathering operation, the opening credits roll and feature a diva moaning the lyrics ""Come to me and kiss me! I love you Weng Weng!"" This was, believe it or not, even creepier than it sounds. In this installment Weng Weng is an INTERPOL agent attempting to break a terrorist organization that is into murder and the kidnapping of industrialists. The action mostly consists of Weng Weng doing some karate or riding his moped while a barely-disguised ""Pink Panther Theme"" plays on a nonstop loop. (Seriously, Henry Mancini really deserves royalties here.) There's also lots of stilted dialogue in INTERPOL headquarters (which looks like a middle school multipurpose room) and in the villain's lair in an attempt to keep you caught up what is supposed to be going on onscreen.

Weng Weng gets into innumerable jams, and conceals himself in the darndest places. My favorites are the old suitcase ploy, and especially the trashcan concealment ploy which gives way to an exciting chase scene involving a garbage truck. Yes, it's slow. Fred Sanford's truck would easily outpace the fastest vehicle in the film, which pads the running time immensely. If there were only two words I was allowed to use to describe the film they would be ""slow"" and ""driving."" There is a boatload of driving (and scooter riding too, of course.) As an aside, I didn't know it was possible to jump a moped across a canyon. Apparently it is if the rider is light enough.

Weng Weng befriends a woman in a bar (the fact that she knows he's Agent 00 doesn't seem suspicious at all) and ends up in a suitcase on a boat with the bad guys. Before it's over he ends up in a parakeet cage and his fate may remind some of a plotpoint of a rather well know mob movie starring Marlon Brando. It is also simultaneously reminiscent of ""Herbie Goes Bananas"" in which The Love Bug also had an encounter of a dubious nature on a boat. Eventually there's a dramatic ending complete with explosions, romance, and a terrible disco-era love song for Weng Weng.

Certainly by any conventional measure this is one horrible movie. It is, however, extremely amusing as an artifact of 1980s Filipino action movies. Collectors of B-movies will want to see this peculiar aberration which is so bad on so many levels (I mean seriously, Imelda Marcos would have been a less conspicuous secret agent than Weng Weng) that it transcends awfulness and comes around to being an amusing comedy in its own right. If you want to see something out of the norm and don't mind blatantly derivative storytelling, caricatures instead of characters, and a star that's short on stature but long on hilarity, ""The Impossible Kid"" is a good choice.",1308787200,4,3740,4.7669753086419755
