The musical has really come a long way in entertainment.",1332979200,,110,4.045454545454546
7817515,5,6301965809,"I thouroughly loved this one! I wouls only add to the other reviewers words by saying I've always loved the song ""Broadway Melody"", both the music and gleefully,carefree happy time flavor of those 1929 lyrics. Thought I'd never be able to listen enough times to this song to satisfy me,BUT,this movie justabout does the trick. I shall be keeping this gem among my treasures and to think I was able to purchase a $680,000.00 movie which grossed 4 million bucks, for only [$$$] here at Amazon. This movie has delicious nostalgia. and if you really try, you can almostget a tangible scent of the places theaters and ambience of the ornate beautiful movie palaces all so new at that time. A time piece and keep-sake of a happier and more carefree ""era,dear-ah."" (Credit Ruth Donelley from her book)
If you've got a love for old movies you just may love this.(vo-dody-oh-do!)",1054771200,6,870,4.768211920529802
7817516,4,6301965809,"Billed as the first all-talking, all-singing, all-dancing film, and it is just that. Taking into consideration the year it was made (1929) and the times (transitionof silents to talking pictures), it does seem like a  valuable effort, and it is. Set the movie standard for future musicals, and  has been copied lots of times since. This one features, great singing and  dancing numbers, and while the dramatic elements are dated they still kind  of work, Bessie Love's performance is also great. Extras: this was the  second movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and the first musical and  the first talking picture to win too. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film  a 7!",957916800,2,674,4.7094017094017095
7817517,3,6301965809,"Well, if you want to watch an early talkie masterpiece, you won`t find it here. Though the film certainly wrote screen history in some way and even received an Oscar, ""Broadway Melody"" is a painfully crude early  talkie musical which makes the ""Jazz Singer"" (released 2 years  earlier) look like a motion picture masterpiece.  The acting is very stagy,  the film mostly plays in stuffy decors and the camera movements are a great  setback from the sophistication of the silent era. On the other hand it is  still one of the best remembered films of this transition era between  silents and sound films and therefore should be watched by everyone  interested in movie  history. Beside this point Bessie Love is still fun to  watch (though the other actors can be discarded easily) and the  ""Wedding of the painted doll""-sequence is certainly an  eye-filler. To conclude, the movie captures the new definition of the  musical genre at the dawn of the sound era perfectly and is one of the  landmark films of MGM between 1929 and 1930, just don`t watch it when you  are too tired to concentrate on the boring plotline .... but judge for  yourself.",951782400,,1144,4.760204081632653
7817518,5,6301965809,"Bessie Love and Anita Page are both wonderful in this film of two sisters trying to make it big on Broadway.  It's a little dated, but the two ladies make it worth your time to see it. The girls' stuttering manager-uncle is a  hoot!  I highly suggest you view this movie if you haven't seen it.",927936000,,294,4.214285714285714
7817519,5,6301965809,"This film was the first talkie to win the Best Picture Academy Award and was a huge hit.  Today it fairly dated but hopes up mainly to two fine performances of the girls playing a sister vaudeville act - Bessie Love as  the less attractive, sassy one (sensational in the end when she gets her  heart-broken in a bit that helped her get a Best Actress nod) and  especially the gorgeous Anita Page, who should have been a superstar,  playing her gentle, beautiful sister.  Miss Page is currently 89 years old  and can be seen today on the E! channels Jean Harlow and Clara Bow episodes  of Mysteries and Scandals.",921715200,3,611,4.490909090909091
