Cool J, his family, and other people talking. I can see that this program was never released on DVD and I just bought a new VCR combination with a DVD recorder for my birthday, so I took this video cassette tape with L.L. Cool J's videos and converted it to a DVD, and it came out clear with a good sound. So, now I have a new copy of this program on DVD to watch so that the VHS tape doesn't ware out. I'll still have the VHS tape of this program kept as a duplicate.",1425081600,,603,3.902439024390244
