7848698,5,6303471609,"When are we going to get this classic 1950's little gem of nostalgia on DVD?  With two terriffic actors still building their careers giving fully convincing performances.  Having been in high school during 1958 I can testify as to the atmospheric authenticity.
This one deserves another chance!",1278979200,,294,5.23404255319149

7848700,5,6303471609,"Just bought this movie and am very glad I did. Great road movie set in the 50s. If you enjoy hotrod, road type movies with a simple but decent plot you'll like this. Nick Nolte did a pretty decent job in his very first movie and interesting to see him and Don Johnson when they were just starting out.

 Cool cars, lots of action .. brought back some good memories. A thoroughly enjoyable movie.",1102204800,4,395,4.324324324324325
7848701,3,6303471609,This movie is pretty enjoyable for the early Nolte and Don Johnson performances. It functions on the level of a Bonnie and Clyde type story  and covers some ground that TWO-LANE BLACTOP covers a little better-but it  still got it's charm!,967939200,6,238,4.780487804878049
7848702,3,6303471609,ok so what if this movie has no plot. its still cool. i just bought another copy ! this was before all the special affects stuff and before don married melanie!. i thought miami vice was cool when it first aired on tv  and watching the reruns sure make me feel old. but i haven't taken a dirt  nap yet and i love the action in these old movies. heck movie stars had to  start somewhere  i am greatful that amazon has a selection and i hope they  will expand it! movie onnnnn,943660800,7,474,4.053763440860215
7848703,4,6303471609,a hopped up 57 chevy and two guys cross country on thier way to the nationals drag race in california. A long the way they meet a girl that nick nolte falls for and then the trouble starts.the most troubling thing is  that a beautiful 57 fuelie gets destroyed.filming leaves a little to be  desired as does the acting but overall definately a keeper.,929923200,13,350,4.453125
