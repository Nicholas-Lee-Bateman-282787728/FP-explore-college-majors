7922387,5,B00004TA16,"This storytelling tour de force should be a part of every dvd/video collection owned by African Americans.  Anita Singleton Prather takes on the roles of 'Aunt Pearlie Sue,' based on the real-life experiences of her grandmother; 'Gallie,' the spiritual leader of the Gullah community, who interprets dreams and prepares the young for the 'rite of passage' in baptismal waters; Chounie, the 'obeah' woman, who intervenes in human troubles, using her knowledge of roots and other esoteric knowledge from the spirit world; and Cutchie, the community 'floozie' who attracts all the men, from the reverend on down.  Prather balances these four elements of rural Southern culture by using humor, faith, and  common sense.",1403481600,5,715,5.366071428571429
