8147010,4,B000IOM26I,"I really liked these movies, and the price was great.  The Christmas Without Snow stars Michael Learned (from the Waltons).  She is newly divorced, and moves to California to start a new life.  The movie focuses on a church choir that she joins, and is about creating a community of friends later in life, in a new city.

The Miracle on 34th street, is the TV black and white version, and runs about 1 hour.  I actually like this shorter version better than the feature length movie.

The set also has a version of Scrooge, which I found enjoyable, and the final movie was just okay.  All in all, I recommend these movies.",1357257600,8,622,4.451327433628318
8147011,2,B000IOM26I,Did not realize this is just some short old versions of classic movies. Black and white versions. Would not recommend. I consider this a waste of money,1356048000,6,151,4.62962962962963
