1776563,1,B00006II68,"Some movies are fun because they are so bad.  This is far and away not one of them.  It is simply bad, in the most mundane sense.

The concept would be interesting if approached another way (a guy becoming a gay werewolf instead of simply a transvestite, as the title implies), but even so the idea of a guy becoming a transvestite after being bitten by one is a funny idea.

Sadly, this film completely and utterly wastes the concept.  It's never funny, the camp is unimaginative and lame, the acting is bland, and the picture quality is grainy.

If you're reading about this movie you must be tempted.  Please believe me - it's not worth it!  Fight the urge this time and pass up this piece of junk.",1097798400,5,701,4.37984496124031

I have watched it with many of my gay friends and they love it also.  It's hilarious, lighten up.  Dick Cheese and Larry Smallbut are funny as anything. This is me and my best friends favorite movie that we insist on watching every single time we get a chance to.  You just can't get tired of it.  It's absolutely wonderful!  Bravo.  Everyone should invest in the wonderful piece of cinema.",1069977600,6,523,4.48936170212766
1776565,1,B00006II68,"One night, a young man is bitten by a transvestite and undergoes a strange transformation during a full moon.  Sounds like it might be campy and fun, right?  That's what I thought until I started watching this film.  Usually bad acting and a bad script can be funny and make a film worth watching, just for the sake of its badness.  Not in this case.
The sound and picture quality of this dvd are sub-par.  I had to up the volume many times to hear what was being mumbled. Also, the film is very grainy and too dark.  I have to give them kudos for the idea behind the story, though.",1060214400,4,582,4.198198198198198
1776566,5,B00006II68,"An excellent parody of the horror classic.  As a gay cult film fan I truly enjoy the total disregard of ""politically correct"".  In fact, it is one of the many endearing qualities of this film.  Rewatchable and a great source for interesting conversation with conservative coworkers that need their cage rattled a bit.  Even those who have made the leap of ""gay"" as an adjective to ""Gay"" as a noun can enjoy a private chuckle at this one!",1045872000,9,437,4.564102564102564

7969214,4,B00006II68,"This is as already stated here, camp. It is not a masterpiece, but it does provide some amusing oddness and slapstick as well. The bit of the woman at the bar and the man with some ""fruit"" in his pocket was good for a chuckle, not to mention the manner in which a silver object was employed to annihilate the creature. Given the obsessions, eccentricities and trends so prominent in America, this bit of levity is a welcome relief, although I can well imagine that some will take it all too seriously. Try also Eating Raoul and Big Meat Eater if you enjoyed it as other means to escape current American reality.",1486425600,,611,4.464285714285714

It's a werewolf spoof that needs to be seen to believed.  A very good example of how funny this movie is, Off The Shelf Reviews on You Tube has the perfect movie review (I'm a little bias because I requested Curse, but LOVED their reaction to it!).

7969219,3,B00006II68,"Curse of the Queerwolf (Mark Pirro, 1988)

Pretty much everything you need to know about Curse of the Queerwolf is in the movie's title. You know it's going to be a very politically incorrect, and very probably stupid, comedy about gay people. You suspect that it's going to play on classic monster movies about werewolves. And if you go into it with no other expectations than this, you'll probably find yourself mildly amused by it. It's certainly not deathless cinema, but there are a couple of chuckles to be had.

The movie's level of humor can be discerned from its main character's name. He is Larry Smalbut (Michael Palazzolo, who never acted in another film), who's an average guy in the years just after World War II until he is bitten by a transvestite and turns into the Queerwolf, who becomes a limp-wristed queen when the full moon comes out and has nightmares of rednecks. Inevitably, the story gets out, and it seems his nightmares may be on the verge of coming true. Can Larry regain his straightness before he's put to the torch?

Pirro is known for making politically incorrect low-budget comedies (Nudist Colony of the Dead is another of his masterpieces), and he's gotten pretty good at it over the years. It's pretty interesting what various people can do with a shoestring budget, some big names in cameo roles (the seemingly ubiquitous Forry Ackerman makes an appearance here), and an amusing script. You're not going to get many guffaws out of this, unless you still bray every time you hear a stupid gay joke, but there are a few clever lines, and some performances that make it worth looking into. The black and white film was a nice touch, as well. Fans of the original The Wolf Man will have fun tracing the parallels. Still, you have to have kind of a thick skin, and of course you can forget all about it if political correctness is your game. Otherwise, though, go into it with no expectations, and you'll have some fun. ** ",1246147200,,1956,4.660869565217391
7969220,5,B00006II68,"If I had my own private shrine honoring the all-time greatest producers of dirt-cheap, hilariously awful films, it would feature life-sized statues of two men: Conrad Brooks and Mark Pirro.  Pirro is a new discovery for me, although he seems to be something of a legend among bad movie lovers and aspiring low-budget filmmakers.  With no Hollywood contacts and almost no money, Pirro has made a career out of doing what he loves.  Even a film like this one, Curse of the Queerwolf, can turn a nice profit since it was produced with a budget of only ten thousand dollars.  I can't wait to get my hands on the other films in the Pirromount Pictures discography, especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nudist-Colony-of-the-Dead/dp/B00000K3B3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nudist Colony of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deathrow-Gameshow/dp/6301005856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deathrow Gameshow</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polish-Vampire-in-Burbank-25-Anniversary-DVD/dp/B000JYW67C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polish Vampire in Burbank - 25 Anniversary DVD</a>&nbsp;(Pirro's first claim to underground fame), and of course, the upcoming The God Complex.  Anybody who actually casts Conrad Brooks (still my pick for the best of the world's worst filmmakers) in his films is more than OK in my book.

Reviewing this film is going to be a challenge, as some of the terms in the film are likely to draw censor-happy eyes.  But here goes.  Larry Smallbut (Michael Palazzolo) is your typical American male.  He cares about his live-in girlfriend, but that doesn't stop him from ""working late"" each night - and by ""working late,"" I of course mean hitting the bars and strip joints with his best bud Richard Cheese (Kent Butler) and picking up loose women for meaningless sex.  Then comes a night when fate rises up to bite him in the rear end - actually, it's his date Paula (Cynthia Brownell) that bites him in the rear end - just before Larry discovers that she has parts that no woman has any business having underneath her nether garments.  But it gets worse.  Just as he starts freaking out about this most sickening of discoveries, a torch-bearing quartet of weirdoes arrive on the scene to tell him that Paula is something much more disturbing than a transvestite - she, er he, is a Dickanthrope or, if you will, a Queerwolf.  Since these men in black are following the monster in order to kill it, Larry keeps the whole bite business to himself.  Even when a gypsy woman identifies him as a Queerwolf by the pansy-gram on his palm and he begins having disturbing nightmares involving hillbillies, he refuses to believe any of it.  Until, that is, he changes during the night of the next full moon and wakes up the next morning in a sauna full of naked men smiling at him.

Finally convinced of his fate, Larry has few options.  He doesn't want to die, especially since the only way to kill a Queerwolf is to drive a silver sex toy up his wazoo, but he certainly doesn't want to live with this limp-handed curse, either - especially since there seems to be a full moon every single night in his world.  Can the power of John Wayne save him?  Is there a Fagxorcist in the house?  Or is Larry doomed to walk the moonlit nights in women's clothes and to spend his days walking funny until he's put out of his misery by the Queerwolf hunters?

Needless to say, Curse of the Queerwolf is as hilarious as it is politically incorrect.  Some feel that every viewer will feel insulted at some point, but I disagree, mainly because the film doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is, an extremely low-budget, utterly inane horror comedy.  The plot itself is funny enough, but the real comedy lies in the details of the dialogue and characters.  For instance, two of the Queerwolf hunters carry their lit torches at all times, no matter what they are doing, and Larry's friend Richard proves to be even funnier than he is annoying.  Even the bad movie clichs somehow work every time.  How could I not give as hilariously bad a film as Curse of the Queerwolf five stars?  This is everything a low-budget, cheesy bad horror comedy should be - and so much more.  My fellow bad movie lovers, take my advice and never pass up a chance to see this hilarious film for yourselves.",1232755200,5,4411,5.140056022408964
7969221,5,B00006II68,"a friend loaned me this video. i had never even heard of it before. this is a very low budget movie that will appeal to those with a ribald or droll sense of humour. man picks up a ""woman"" in a bar who turns out to have more than he bargained for. ""she"" turns out to be a he who was bitten by a queerwolf. every time the moon is full, he developes a ""limp wrist"". naturally our hero is bitten on the bum and finds an unexpected change in his life's direction. from here on the movie becomes an unending stream of of limp wrist jokes, puns, and gags that will delight those who watch. warning! it's possible to die laughing while watching this movie!",1194912000,,649,4.158730158730159
7969222,5,B00006II68,"I own this film on vhs and have enjoyed it over the years.  This is truly a bad movie, but it is so bad it is campy.  On that level, this is truly a gem.  The acting is terrible as well as the film work itself, but the script is wonderfull and this is why the film actually works.  It is well written and if it had a real budget, it could have been actually very good.

The concpet of the film is the hero goes out on a ""date"" and is bitten by what he thinks is a woman.  When the moon comes out, Larry changes into a transvestite.  Now add all of the cliches from hollywood about transvestites and horror films and you get the idea.  It really does work on its own level.

If you want to spend time laughing, you have to buy this film.  Just remember, it is terrible.  It is terrible on the level of ""bubba ho-tep"", but with a much worse budget.  Highly recommended.",1137024000,3,867,4.005847953216374
