1101528,3,6305972109,"Yvonne DeCarlo (of Munster's fame) and Karen Black in the same

movie...not bad!  However, it gets rather distracting that the

only colors favored in the movie are blue or green (other than

the goth black).  After awhile, you focus only on all the blue.

Blue towels, a blue phone, blue clothes of every possible pattern

and shade.  Is there symbolism in this blue vs. black?  I think

all the blue/green hospital colors are there to provide a

contrast to the red blood.  Very tiring to watch.  Another

distraction: Karen Black's wigs.  Add in some full backside

nudity from Charley Spradling as Charleen.",1104969600,,611,4.8431372549019605
1101529,4,6305972109,"This is another one of those movies where the lesson learned is don't make fun of the different. Rainbow Harvest plays Megan, a goth-type girl from LA. Her new schoolmates tease and torment her, but she befriends a girl named Nikki.

In Megan's new house is a mirror which gives her powers. What she doesn't know is that the demon inside begins to control her and that's when the real trouble starts. Megan has fun at first by having the mirror kill a would-be boyfriend, a big boobed class president, and the nosy antique lady. But when she loses control and attacks Nikki and drowns her boyfriend, things go downhill for Megan from there.

The ending is a bit strange because Nikki goes back in time to the become the original owner of the mirror, a witch who killed her sister. Now she is back in that age and sees that she has stabbed Megan in the same way.

A few laughs, a few frights, some good bloody scenes, and even a MILF. What more could you want on a Saturday night at three in the morning?",1104537600,4,1003,4.352941176470588
1101530,3,6305972109,"A social teen outcast (played by Winona Ryder look-a-like Rainbow Harvest) discovers a mirror in her room that gives her special powers, which she proceeds to use violently on her taunting classmates.  This supernatural horror/thriller takes way too long to really get going, but is pretty entertaining for the last forty or so minutes.  Despite a few very silly moments and a baffling ending, there's enough blood, suspense, and nudity to satisfy horror fans looking for a quick fix.

1101531,5,6305972109,"If you really want to be scared, and your not afraid of the  dark, you must see this movie. I was on the edge of my seat  the whole time. Director Sargenti did a fabulous job.

1101532,3,6305972109,"MIRROR MIRROR is a rip off of every teen angst movie you've ever seen, mostly CARRIE & THE FURY, and it's all the more enjoyable for it. Director Sargenti offers up this fluff horror piece about a shy ""goth"" girl named Megan (Rainbow Harvest) who moves to a new school filled with your expected bitchy cheerleaders and obnoxious jocks. The class sweetheart Nikki (Kristen Datillo) makes ""nice"" with Megan and tries to help her join the popularity club, but it backfires repeatedly. Lucky for Megan, and no one else, she finds a magic mirror which empowers her with the ability to create ""Fury"" on her enemies through nose bleeds, burnings, drowings, and the ability to project demons in the form of her classmates to carry on murderous deeds.
The film moves quickly, has an authentically eerie look thanks to the cast and settings always being dressed in shades of blue & green, and offers of some good suspense. And then there's the cast to die for: Yvonne DeCarlo, Karen Black, Ricky Paull Golden, William Sanderson, Charlie Spradling... and more. For a fun time with fluffy scares and some decent monster make up, check it out... but skip the lame sequels.",969753600,17,1159,4.8

7898593,4,6305972109,"A flashback opening shows us the bloody murder of a woman by her identical twin sister. This has something to do w/ the odd, whispering mirror in the room! Fast forward to recent days, and MIRROR MIRROR (1990) begins. A woman named Emelin (Yvonne De Carlo) runs across the dreaded mirror, while cleaning out the house for sale. She has it moved to her antique shop. Enter Susan Gordon (Karen Black- TRILOGY OF TERROR) and her daughter Megan (Rainbow Harvest), the new owners of the house, and the mirror, which has mysteriously returned! Megan attends her new high school, where her goth / Boy George look gains... attention. Alas, she just doesn't fit in. Luckily, student Nikki Chandler (Kristin Datillo) befriends Megan. Meanwhile, Emelin reads up on the mirror's strange history in an old diary. When their dog is found dead in front of the mirror, Susan and Megan have no idea what lies ahead for them! Back at school, poor Megan feels the cruel bite of exclusion and humiliation. Oh my stars! The mirror starts oozing blood, causing icky problems for Megan's tormentors! When one of her teachers drops dead, Megan returns home to seal her pact w/ the demonic looking-glass. Horror and death ensue, and Megan's high school experience improves by attrition. Can anything stop her vengeful rampage? BEST SCENES: #1- The boiled-in-the-shower scene! #2- The bathtub-drowning scene! #3- The garbage disposal scene! This takes us up to the sensational, supernatural showdown finale! Oh yeah! Vintage cheeeze like this doesn't grow on trees! Unless, we're talking about cheeeze trees, of course...",1520726400,,1595,5.068441064638783
7898594,2,6305972109,"A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. The acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of ""Friday the 13th: the Series"" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. That packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films.",1516838400,,898,4.875816993464053

7898599,5,6305972109,"'Mirror Mirror' is one of those Horror films I've always loved over the years but have easily forgotten about.  Its also a flick that I have to be in a certain mood to watch.  Maybe for a nostalgic reason.  More to remind myself that are are great 90's Horror films in a time when most considered Horror not so good.  'Mirror Mirror', its original but not so original if that makes any sense (haha).  When comparing, as an example, lets just say off the top of my head, it reminded me of that well-respected flick, 'Christine', but instead of a possessed car, we have a possessed mirror.  Unlike 'Christine', the mirror not only possesses a person but gives he/she deadly powers as seen in other Horror films such as 'Carrie'.

I'm aware that Mirror Mirror has many sequels but have never bothered to seek them out because I've always felt that this is a story that isn't suppose to have sequels (in my opinion).  I've actually felt that way about many titles but that's another topic.

'Mirror Mirror' is perfect all by itself and doesn't need further chapters.  I think it's neat to actually see the demon within the mirror!  For its time, I feel it still holds up on the creep factor and will always keep its strange vibe.  It's a simple little horror that's not loaded with over-the-top gore.  Don't get me wrong, there are some splatter scenes that impressed me and those scenes are spaced throughout this film making it easy/fun to watch.  Overall, I think the acting, special effects, and pacing is great.  I feel its a four-star rating but I give it that fifth star simply for nostalgia.  Check it out; it's not a bad Horror film at all.",1264032000,6,1645,4.54421768707483
