7852628,4,6303622623,"Often times ""The Valentine's Day Massacre"" video gets overlooked by Dice fans. But the fact is, this is a great Dice show. He spills out one raunchy joke after another. This was his last great show available for public sale. Please stay away from a horrendous ""I'm Over Here Now,"" which amazingly was o.k.'d for release by some unintelligible video company. The only drawback ""Valentine's Day Massacre"" offers is the fact that Dice's show lasts for only a third of the video's length, while other young comics take the mike after his introductory act. But Dice shows one last time that he is the king of comedy in this video despite solid performances by the other young comics.",995068800,7,678,4.754237288135593
