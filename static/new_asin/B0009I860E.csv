2291234,4,B0009I860E,"As a behavior consultant working with children with special needs, and as a parent of two boys, I found Shae by Air an excellent introductory visual story about flying. My son (20 months) had a wonderful time watching Shae by Air.  Shae is now synonymous with airplane for him.  We were able to watch the video together and review basic vocabulary.  I'd ask, ""What's that!"" and he was able to label what he saw.  The video had a nice pace.  He loves watching airplanes and got to see lots of them in the music video.  By the time we were ready for the flight, he boarded with his little red backpack and the cute Shae by Air luggage tag (Grandma and Grandpa got him a ""Good Little Traveler"" T-shirt as well).  He was decked out and the stewardess commented on how cute he was on the way in, BUT how would he do during the flight?  The video certainly helped him prepare as well as review what to do.  When we boarded off the flight, the stewardess commented, ""He sure was a good  little traveller!""",1141084800,,998,4.345945945945946
2291235,5,B0009I860E,"We have a 2 year old daughter that we recently took on a cross-country flight from east coast to west (and back).  Prior to our trip, my wife and I were interested in any material or advice for making the event more of an adventure and less of an ordeal.  We found, and purchased, several printed books (from amazon.com).  In addition to printed media, we wanted some sort of movie or video to introduce air travel to our daughter.  We found 'Shae By Air' here, but were unable to purchase through amazon directly (kits weren't ready to ship yet).  We ended up contacting Shae directly and having her send us a copy a couple of weeks prior to the flight.  Our daughter was glued to the screen!  She would run around after dinner shouting ""SHAE, SHAE!""  We even got her to ask for a water bottle during viewing to practice making her ears go ""pop"".  Anyone travelling with a 2+ year old on an airplane for the first time would do well to include this great video in your preparation arsenal.

BTW - if you live near an airport and have the time prior to the trip, I'd recommend a trip there to witness first hand planes taking off (""UP, UP, UP!"") and landing (""Touchdown!"").",1139788800,5,1173,4.413953488372093
2291236,4,B0009I860E,"I am planning to fly with my twin 2 year olds by myself.  I wanted to find something to show them about flying, other than books.  This is the perfect answer.  It is not silly, animated or sickening cutesy.  It is very visual, simple and minimal talking.  We talk about Shae all the time when we see planes.  I give the movie 4 stars because I felt there needed to be a little more emphasis on staying close to Mommy.  The movie does not show a lot of people in the airport to reinforce that fact.  Also, the DVD kit comes with 2 travel tags to attach to your child's bag.  Both broke as I was attaching them to my daughters' bags.",1130112000,2,631,4.10655737704918
2291237,4,B0009I860E,"Great DVD and my daughter, age 2, certainly loves to watch it. The packing list and travel tags are an added bonus. My only negative thought was that had I seen it before buying I would not have paid $20 for it. We wait to see how she relates to it when we travel to the UK later this year.",1123718400,,290,3.85
2291238,5,B0009I860E,"I bought ""Shae by Air"" for my twin nieces -- well, really, for my sister and brother-in-law -- to help them prepare for the long flight from NYC to Greece.  Not only did the girls watch the DVD repeatedly before their trip, they continue to watch it still.  My sister said that throughout the flight the girls mentioned Shae when they wanted to do something, as in, ""I'm going to get my snack out now, like Shae does.""  I'm definitely gifting this video to friends and family members as their kids hit toddler age.",1120780800,,514,4.446808510638298
2291239,5,B0009I860E,"Preparing your child for travel is so important and this way definately worked!!!! No tantrums!!!!  Also, my 3 year old still likes to watch the DVD for fun.  I am glad someone finally came up with this wonderful idea.  LOVE IT!!!!!!",1116547200,,233,4.634146341463414
2291240,5,B0009I860E,"As a pediatric therapist working with children for the past 7 years, I was thrilled to have found Shae by Air.  Shae by Air is a wonderful, step-by step story of a little girl, named Shae, getting ready for her first trip by air.  So many children do not know what to expect when they travel in an airplane for the first time, much less what to expect of the airport.  Children love to watch videos, and Shae By Air gives the child a visual of what everything looks like and what to expect before they get there.  Shae by Air covered everything from going through the security checkpoints in the airport to proper etiquette and how to pass time on the airplane.  Shae by Air eases so much anxiety about flying in both the little ones and their parents.  I was excited to see that Shae by Air comes with a packing check off list and a personalized luggage tag, which is a fabulous idea to give the child an opportunity to truly become part of the flying experience.  Shae by Air is an ingenious and much needed video. I am thrilled to have findly found a video that will benefit everyone who travels by air with a child;  and I can not wait for the rest of the series to be made!",1114300800,7,1178,4.227678571428571
2291241,5,B0009I860E,"This is a perfect DVD for your toddler if she/he is about to get onto a plane trip. The simple messages as well as the lovely music make it very pleasing to watch for you as well as your tot. My son, has watched it over and over and when we were ready to go on our plane trip, he knew exactly what to pack.",1114300800,2,306,3.723076923076923
2291242,5,B0009I860E,"I have been a speech-language pathologist for over six years, working with young children with a variety of communication issues.  Pragmatic language (social skills) have been a major area of focus with many of my children, and a growing area of concern to parents and teachers.  Now there is finally an outstanding tool to assist young children in their preparation for air travel.  Through a child's perspective, this DVD captures the travel experience of children today in a ""new day"" of travel.  The DVD shows children what to expect from their arrival at the airport, to going through daunting security lines & checks, to sitting in their seats as courteous and responsible travelers.  I have been in many airports and planes where children behaved inappropriately, as the result of not knowing what was expected of them or what they could expect from a travel experience.  Young Shae shows parents and children how youngsters can be an integral part of the travel process. Through use of visuals, modeling, age-appropriate langauge, and child friendly scenarios,Shae shows all children what to expect when they travel and how to handle different situations. Shae by Air includes unique and child friendly travel innovations; a packing list and luggage tags for each child.  What a phenomenal way to get young children involved in the travel process, and an engaging way to help prepare them for their journey.  I have found this to be a wonderful gift and recommendation for families I work with, as most have had problems traveling with their children at one point or another.  I have watched children view this DVD in wonder and curiosity as they watch Shae's entire journey.  Many responses have included, ""Where will Shae go now? I want to travel on the plane, and I'm going to count luggage."" Most importantly children frequently say, ""I want to be a ""Good Little Traveler"" too.""  What a clever and effective way of modeling for children the appropriate social skills needed to travel.  Finally a parent who has initiated the design and implementation of a tool that sets expectations for children.  Now young children can finally be set up for success when they travel and even more, they can feel good about themselves and their experiences.  In addition to the child friendly packing tools, Shae's journey is accompanied by soothing and stimulating music throughout her travels.  A music video with different types of planes has also been an added bonus with the kids; promoting vocabulary, questions, and a plethora of communication.  I am thrilled beyond words that an innovative and creative idea for travel with children is finally on the market for people to benefit from.  What did we ever do without this DVD? Thanks so much to the creator of The I'm A Good Little Traveler! DVD Toolkit Series: Shae By Air. Your product is making an amazing difference in the lives of traveling families of young children EVERYWHERE.  Job well done!!!!  I will defintely continue to recommend this one of a kind travel tool to families.",1114214400,4,3041,4.974308300395257
2291253,3,B0009I860E,"I bought this ""travel kit"" for my 3 year old grandchildren when they were going on their first vacation by air. While it does show Shea preparing for the trip and going through the airport, it fails to address the point that there are lots of other travelers also going through the airport at the same time. I wondered as I watched it how they were able to video this with no one else in the airport or on the plane at the time. I thought it was overpriced and the ""kit"" only includes the video and baggage tags.",1315612800,,512,4.181818181818182
2291254,4,B0009I860E,"Flying my granddaughter to Orlando was going to be great!  Except that she was ""vewy, vewy sceered"" to fly.

We found this DVD just in time!  My 5-year-old loved it so much that she filmed it on my iPhone so she could watch it again on the way to the airport. When we landed, she proudly said, ""I'm a good little traveler!""

It is a little dated. But it works!",1314403200,,360,4.1
2291255,5,B0009I860E,I read the reviews before purchasing this product but wanted to wait and see the results before I commented myself.  My 3 year old daughter just succesfully completed her first round trip airplane flight from Boston to Orlando and I know that a big portion of it was thanks to this video.  She knew exactly what to expect at the airport and was very conscientious about not kicking the seat in front of her because she knows that is not a good thing. There were no surprises and she acted like an old pro at the airport.  Good job!,1307491200,,531,4.343434343434343
2291256,5,B0009I860E,"My 3.5 year old loved this video.  We watched it together so he could get familiarized with what to expect while travelling by air.  This is a great tool.  He enjoyed watching Shae's experiences.  He was a good little traveller too!

This was shipped by the producer of the video.  They provided great service.  Got the DVD very quickly.",1301961600,,337,4.610169491525424
2291257,5,B0009I860E,"My daughter who is 2 1/2 is taking her first trip to see Grandma and Grandpa at their house and needed something to prepare her.. She is an observer, she watches others doing before she will try most things herself so I thought this video would be perfect preparation for her. She loved the video and asks to watch it at least once a day.. It is simple and short but I think it is the perfect amount of information for a young child.. It covers the basic things that happen in an airport and on the plane that may scare a young traveler, ticket lines, security, take off and the ear issue, whats expected of them such as following the seatbelt instructions ect... I thought the video was very well done, simple, narrated in a calm soothing voice that seems to minimize the fear and anxiety associated with air travel for a young child and like I said covers all the basic points of air travel.. I like that it was documentary style with out all the cutesy distractions, my daughter really related to it.. worth the purchase for the young traveler",1297641600,,1046,4.424870466321243
2291258,4,B0009I860E,"This is a must-have DVD to watch for toddlers/kids who will be traveling on air! The DVD was created from a child's point of view, easy to understand, short to the point and quite engaging! I watched this a few times with my 3 year-old and we also talked about it. I reminded him of the flying etiquette learned from the DVD as we got closer to flying date.  He could tell me everything about it which means the message of the DVD really got into his head! We flew a few times domestically within the States and every flight we went through the ""rules"" of flying.  In Oct 2010, we finally went on the longest journey by air - 22 hours to Singapore travelling with a 3-year-old and a 15 month-old with success! Thanks to this DVD!  Of course it helped to load up the little Elmo hand-carry bag (with wheels) with lots of books, little toys and games for them to last the entire journey! After this trip to the other end of the world, I can proudly say that my little ones are really great little travelers, all thanks to this DVD! Highly recommended!

I gave this a 4-star because I think it's about time this DVD is updated with the latest security measures/complications at the airport so as to prep the kids better.  I really hope a new version will be released soon. Thanks!",1292889600,,1277,4.348739495798319
2291259,5,B0009I860E,"I was freaking out at the prospect of taking our very active 23-month-old, who doesn't like to sit still for more than a minute, on a 2-hour plane trip to North Carolina. I bought Shae By Air after reading about it on an online forum. T watched the video intently several times and was excited to do everything exactly like Shae. He packed his teddy bear and books, counted the suitcases while we stood on line to check our bags, breezed through security, and sat happily on the plane for more than two hours (though I have to admit the toddler apps on the iPad helped). He was thrilled to have goldfish crackers on the plane like Shae, and he even insisted on drinking water during takeoff and landing as he learned in the video. After we landed, people came up to compliment us on what a good little traveler T was! I highly recommend this video to anyone flying with a toddler.",1291766400,,880,4.404907975460123
2291260,1,B0009I860E,"A shame this video wasn't helpful at all.  Do you have children?  Have you ever been on an airplane before?  Do you have common sense?  If you answered yes to all of these questions, or really just one of them, the video won't help you.  It is short, really short.  They didn't even try to pad the length by filling it with even more worthless information.  I bought this because even though my two-year old son had been on plenty of trips before, he hadn't been on a 23-hour overseas adventure.  Don't buy this, please.  Save your money for a company that actually would try to prepare you and your child for a plane trip.",1290470400,,623,4.3478260869565215
2291261,5,B0009I860E,"This is a cute, short movie. It is very helful to prepare your child on what to expect at the airport & on the plane. We watched it several times before the flight, and my daughter seemed really excited when we got to the airport, because she knew where she was! The movie is narrated with a calm voice, and pleasent music, great for before bedtime. There is also a short airplane music video, which my daughter also enjoyed.",1280966400,,425,4.3924050632911396
2291262,4,B0009I860E,"The DVD arrived about 1 week before my 3 1/2 year old son's first trip. He'd been looking forward to his first airplane trip, so it was easy to get him to be interested in watching the DVD.

And one he watched it, he kept wanting to watch it over, and over, and over...

And over, and over, and over. :)

The results: Literally zero power struggles, difficulties, challenges, or tantrums on both the outbound and return flights. I was truly amazed at how calm he was. At one point though, we walked into a store and while my back was turned he put a toy airplane into his backpack!  I had to explain to him that we had to put it back and go on the real airplane, and even then he was very understanding.

Anyway, in my opinion the video was a huge success and adequately prepared him for the trip.

That said, I mirror other comments' sentiments that the movie seemed to lack the reinforcement of holding parents' hands inside the airport, and also didn't really give an adequate representation of the business of an airport.

I also recommend that for toddlers you get the CARES restraint harness, and also make sure your child has his/her own rolling luggage bag. Because the restraint was familiar (like a car seat), I believe it helped my child feel more calm and at peace on the airplane. The luggage bag gave my son a sense of ownership and participation in the event - that he could be ""just like Daddy"" and then, of course, mirror my actions, direction, etc.",1278633600,3,1466,4.4275092936802976
2291273,4,B0009I860E,"I definitely had mixed emotions about purchasing this product. It's fairly expensive and the cover looks a little dated. However, because we were going to take our first trans-ocean flight as a family with a 3 1/2 year old girl and a 1 1/2 year old boy, my wife and I decided to give it a try.

First off, it's not a toolkit as it might suggest. It's a DVD with some luggage tags. Don't expect much more than that. Secondly the DVD itself is pretty poorly produced and dated. I'm not sure why Shae's mom had dress on the scantily side (shorter skirt with fishnet stockings. shocking? no, but seriously, who thought that outfit would look good?) The video was pretty slow moving for our younger child, was fine for our older one but was really hard to watch for the adults. (I recommend sitting with them to explain what's going on in the video and to keep them jazzed about the content. such as ""hey look how cool it is to have your own special luggage!"") OK, I'm being nitpicky. Moving on...

Most importantly, how does this video prepare your child for air travel? It was incredible. Our daughter completely related to Shae and remembered all of the tips and tricks outlined in the film. Children are imitators after all, and watching someone model the expectations really sticks in their little minds. Our daughter would say, ""ok now it's time to go through the beeping gate (metal detector) and I'm not going to be scared like Shae wasn't scared or ""Shae showed me not to kick the seat so (brother's name) don't kick the seat because it's ouwee for that person"". I was pretty dang impressed. 6 hours over the Pacific Ocean and back, not one fit was thrown by either child. (trust me, our kids are no angels)

To summarize, DVD is expensive, outdated, somewhat boring and Shae's mom's outfit is questionable but it does what it's advertised to do and that's to model what being a good little traveler looks like. Give it a try, you may be surprised.",1273017600,9,1952,4.524079320113314
2291274,3,B0009I860E,"I was happy to receive this as a gift from family, but was disappointed to see that it didn't go over the full flight experience.
1.  I was hoping to see Shae use the bathroom in the airport while she was waiting to board the plane, as well as what a bathroom looks like and how to use one on an airplane.  (I know it's a bit scary at first because of the small space and loud flushing noise).
2.  There is also no video about the pilot or flight attendants and their jobs during the flight.  Not to mention all the new people that will also be on the plane, and how to interact with them.
3.  There is no mention of what type of behavior for children to exhibit when they move about the cabin during the flight (especially a long-haul trip).  The detailed information of what to do when a child is in their airplane seat was very informative.
4.  I was pleased that the security checkpoints were mentioned in detail.
Overall, this video was OK.  I believe that the more you prepare and practice with a child before experiencing an event, the easier it is for a child to handle it (emotionally & physically).  If this video included the details mentioned above it would be an excellent preparation for flying with kids.",1271980800,,1219,4.3584070796460175
2291275,1,B0009I860E,"This DVD was disappointing.  It had raving reviews so we bought it to prepare our 2 yr old child for his 1st flight but he got bored after 10 minutes.  The DVD is very slow, the people in it looked like they were from the 1980's and the music was nothing catchy.  It may be more entertaining for older children or girls who can look at Shae as a role model but not for my son.  Felt it was a waste of $.",1270166400,,403,3.819277108433735

I am so glad I did!  When we first watched it a few weeks ago I was amazed at how adorable it is...little Shae is a doll and my son might have a little crush on her.  We probably watched it about 4 times in a row the first time, but it never got old (which says a lot when you're talking about kids videos!).  All in all, it's his favorite dvd these days and I'm not sick of watching it yet.  It gives plenty of information for the toddler/preschool age child but not so much to overwhelm them.  It's even helped with my son's counting!  I'm not a great flyer myself, but even I feel more at ease after watching this dvd a gazillion times.  It's so peaceful and delightful.  You won't be disappointed!",1250726400,3,878,4.203592814371257
2291277,3,B0009I860E,"I purchased this DVD to prepare my 5-year old for his first flight after reading so many positive reviews.  The DVD is well-done, especially with it's reassuring tone; however, I feel a number of important points/issues are overlooked that seem like major omissions that result in a disappointing product:

1) I don't recall the narrative commenting on how flying is a very safe way of travelling.

2) No information is provided about how planes are able to fly.  Yes, the DVD is geared toward children, but a simple explaination - including a view of a friendly pilot - would be worthwhile.

2) No information is provided about flight attendants and their role in keeping passengers safe (e.g., although they are most often seen handing out drinks/snacks, they are like policemen on a plane in that they know the rules, are there to help, and must be listened to).

3) There is no discussion about using airplane restrooms (which even I as an adult find scary when the toilet makes that powerful ""whooshing"" sound).

4) Speaking of sounds, there isn't anything about the sounds a plane makes while taking off, flying, landing.

5) The section dealing with manners could have been improved by discussing that flying sometimes requires sitting still for a long time, possibly sitting next to someone you don't know (but don't need to fear), and that delays sometimes happen.

All in all, the idea of the DVD is an excellent one but it could have been executed more fully.  I would hesitate to recommend it, unless parents are prepared to fill in a lot of information gaps.",1249430400,5,1571,4.806691449814126

We packed her backpack using the included list, we counted suitcases at the ticket counter, we went through security happily, and we didn't kick the seat in front of us.

He watched it several times before we left, and we brought it with on the plane with a DVD player, just in case.  This video helped predict many of the situations that we encountered.

There was only one problem with it that we had. In the video, the little girl is given a treat/gift from the stewardess for being a good little traveler at the end of the flight. Well, that didn't happen on our flight! I anticipated this problem on the way to our destination, and asked the stewardess to bring him some cookies near the end of our flight. He accepted my explanation that this was his present from the stewardess, but I forgot to do it on the flight home. Then he was quite sad, and thought he must not have been a 'good little traveler' no matter what I said, because the stewardess did not give him a present. It took some work to get through this. This may not be a problem for a non-autistic child, but I thought it should be mentioned so you could prepare - just in case.

Overall, it was an excellent preparation video for my child, and I want to purchase an additional copy for my library.

We also found the children's video clips (free to watch) on the TSA website VERY helpful! [...]",1240876800,,1314,4.329268292682927
2291281,3,B0009I860E,"I just bought and viewed Shae by Air.  It is a good video to show to young ones about to go on an airplane and is probably the only one of its kind.  It was made in 2004, I believe, so it's a little dated.  The airport scene is not very typical of a crowded international airport, which can really intimate a child.  It doesn't really cover long lines, delays, etc..  The mother also packs a water bottle to take with her, which these days is not allowed.  The security scene could have used some more realism showing multiple scanners, bins, longer lines/larger crowds and the need to show your boarding pass to the TSA agent.  It also may have been good to show Shae having to go back through the metal detector and, perhaps, getting manually scanned with a wand.  There was also no scene covering waiting for the airplane to board at the gate, or going through a JetWay.  They probably could have covered half, if not all of this extra material by reducing the slightly long introduction and packing sequence.

Though it could be a better product, it's still a nice to have because there really is no other product like it - that I could find.",1236729600,4,1146,4.414285714285715

She wanted to watch it every day in the weeks before our trip and loved to pretend to pack her bag just like Shae.  On the airplane ride - which went wonderfully, she had goldfish snack just like Shae, colored just like Shae and even pretended to sleep, just like Shae.

It does show the security and the plane, I wish it showed more of the inside of the plane and loading, like the walkway to the plane and such.

2291295,2,B0009I860E,"I bought this for my 20 month old daughter as we are going to be flying in late September this year. She loved the images of airplanes but she wasn't interested at all by Shae nor by what Shae did. For the price paid, you would expect more commentaries and advices. Furthermore, either that the video was shot long time ago or it was shot in a fake airport terminal and airplane but it wasn't believable at all. Also in the security inspection scene - the mom went through the detector with her long boots on! It was totally not realistic at all so will not be able to prepare the child for the reality of a busy airport with brusque officers, loads of people and long queues. They should remake the film. Or maybe I could do my own film and sell it online. LOL",1216771200,,761,4.219178082191781

It follows a little girl through a plane ride. My son really like's Shae & now always asks to watch the dvd. When i tell him not to kick the seat in front he say's ""uh oh, like Shae"", then stops. So the dvd does have an influence on his behavior during a trip in the car or plane. The music is nice & not annoying like most dvd's geared towards toddler. No annoying catchy song to get out of your head:o) I'm so happy they made this dvd!!",1213920000,4,611,3.935483870967742

We had flown with him frequently while he was a baby, but once he was a toddler, the experience was completely different.  My son loves the video and reminds us that ""the little girl says no kicking"" (the seat in front of him) and that he needs to drink water during take-off/landing to help his ""ears popping.""  Although we had tried to prepare him with these same instructions, it was only when he witnessed Shae's good behavior that he really listened!",1209686400,3,554,4.465346534653466

I think I am most disapointed with how it was filmed; there's a lot of focus on the girl who's flying with her mom and less on the full view of the airport.  They spend moments on the mom putting on her coat, then her hat, then fixing her hair as they get off the plane.  I just thought that was not useful.  the view out the window of the plane was nonexistant due to clouds; they couldn't wait to get a better view?  a bit of sky?  Maybe it was all enough info for my 5 & 3 yr old, but to me, it wasn't what I expected.  I will say the idea to film something like this is great!  I only wished I'd looked further to see if others had made something like this and to have taken more time to see if there was a better version.  It's not horrible, but I thought it was genearlly mediocre in it's creation.",1191024000,2,963,3.872448979591837

Since then, she has insisted on using the packing list, preparing her own carry-on bag and rewatching the DVD before every trip.  People remark about her behavior and what an angel she is during the checkpoint process and on the plane.  She has even reminded other children on the plane (that she did not know) that you should not kick the seat in front of you.  The passenger in the seat being kicked actually thanked me.  To this day, my daughter loves the DVD.  It was money well spent.  Cheers to Shae By Air!!!",1188172800,2,650,4.31404958677686

They did a pretty good job of covering the basics.  I would have liked to see a little more about the security stuff as they didn't show what happens if the bells and buzzers go off.  Also they could have shown a little more about what not to do on an airplane, such as talking loudly, getting up and stuff like that.  All in all a good piece of work and a great converstion tool for little ones.",1186790400,,534,3.9166666666666665

On the plane, he was very proud to tell the people around us, and the flight crew that HE was a good little traveller and would never kick the seat in front of him!!!

Though we have not yet made the trip, this video captivated our 2 & 3 year old boys.  They love Shae and have become fascinated with airplanes, the security line, not kicking the seat in front of you... etc.

I would highly recommend this to anyone travelling with a toddler!",1177027200,9,373,4.537313432835821
2291318,5,B0009I860E,"This is an incredible tool to prepare your child for air travel.
My two year old was captivated by Shae and could relate to her throughout the process.
 I liked that the DVD addressed common issues that children face in an airport and on an airplane -
going through security (putting their belongings on the moving belt),
 not kicking the seat ahead of them, ""pop"" of the ears, etc.

Even though this is intended for toddlers, I believe it would be informative for ANY child who is preparing for a flight.

Thank you for creating this professional, informative, developmentally appropriate DVD-
this will make a difference for many people:
the children that learn from watching it, the parents of these prepared children, and the other passengers onboard-
NOT affected by kicked seats or screaming kids!

I am excited to include this tool on my website JetWithKids. Thank you!",1162512000,10,876,4.891891891891892

This is a wonderful and very professionally made and edited DVD.  My 2 year old daughter was absolutely fascinated and had no trouble understanding the ""plot"".  I bought it to prepare her for a 5 hour flight to Guatemala and it really did help.  She took the whole airport and flight experience in stride, with many references to Shea, and was very happy and excited to be traveling just like Shea does.  She even took care not to bounce or kick the seat in front of her because in the video Shea learns not to do this. This is a great product for any child about to take a plane flight or indeed any child simply interested in airports and planes.",1147046400,7,732,4.392592592592592

I actually think that showing turbulence might have scared her instead of making her excited to fly.  My other grandchild, a 2-year-old boy, who loves planes and airports, just loved that there was a movie about those two things.  My favorite part was being able to use Shae as a reminder: would Shae put her feet on that gentleman's seat?  No!  And down those feet would go.  Business travelers should hand the DVD out when they get on the plane!",1145577600,3,595,4.566037735849057

I had read the reviews for this DVD, immediately ordered it, and was very happy when it arrived in advance of our trip. I am a seasoned traveler myself and I think the ""Shae by Air"" concept is great. However, the DVD has 2 very significant gaps: 1) there is no discussion of turbulence; 2) very little is said about the plane staff (stewards and stewardesses) and their role.

I particularly find the absence of any discussion of air turbulence a significant omission. There is a very simple and effective way to explain this event that would likely avert anxiety when it is encountered. Finally, spending a bit more time talking to your children about the role of the ""plane helpers"" is recommended. Overall - I thought this DVD was only somewhat helpful as it presented the primary topics re: air travel and children. However, in the end, I am disappointed in what I feel is incomplete content.",1143504000,7,1021,4.548913043478261

8061109,5,B0009I860E,"Great product.  Ignore the folks who call it boring and outdated.  It works the way it is supposed to!

I bought this 2 years ago before flying solo with my 3 and 4.5 yo kids.  I thought we might watch it a couple times before going, but they LOVED it.  Asked to watch over and over again.  My 3 yo daughter was so mesmerized, she asked to take it with us!

It is a simple and low-budget film.  It shows a girl packing, going through the airport, and then sitting on the plane.  They show what she might see (luggage rolling by), and experience both in the airport (security checkpoint), and on the plane (seat backs reclining, tray tables, stowing bags beneath seats, ears popping).  It is slow and deliberate because it is designed for young children.  It does not have flash and action, which I assume is the driver of most complaints.  There are no iPads and DVD players shown (hence the ""outdated"" criticisms).  The child is allowed to pack crayons and paper, a couple books, and a bear.  My 3yo daughter diligently packed exactly what she saw in the film, and strode through the airport, proudly and confidently.  Her 4yo brother was right beside her, just as confident.

Now, nearly 2 years later, they noticed the Shae tags on their little suitcases and asked to see the film again.  I don't get it, but am thrilled.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It is well made, well thought out, and includes only the essentials.

p.s.  Of course, I did have an iPad packed in my bag, but that wasn't part of the kids' packing experience for the plane.",1392681600,2,1547,4.473118279569892

I say buy it if you have no other way to show them how to behave on a plane.  Otherwise, outdated and needs to be updated.  I felt like I was watching some kind of old silly instructional video.

There's nothing else out there that provides a comparable educational video as far as I have looked so this is indeed a valuable and unique resource.

The not so good: Dated and somewhat limited in comparison to the real life experience. A bit on the expensive side for a brief movie.
