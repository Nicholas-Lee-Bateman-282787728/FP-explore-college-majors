5924078,1,B00EK1KXQG,"I wanted to like this movie, and with each passing minute I thought maybe there was a chance, but it never happened and I had to bail about halfway through.  It's a decent idea for a movie (think hangover), and the actors are likable, but it just never took off.  The plot continues to weaken as the movie progresses, and things eventually get a little hard to follow.  Kind of a shame because if the writing would have been a little better, this would have been a decent low budget film.",1417651200,,488,4.34065934065934

5924088,1,B00EK1KXQG,This was like 7th graders trying to remake The Hangover.  I kept waiting for the funny part but it never showed up.  The positive reviewers must have done more drugs than the characters in the movie.,1402099200,3,199,4.5
5924089,5,B00EK1KXQG,"I also thought this would be a Hangover knockoff however I absolutely loved it. I may be a tad biased because I absolutely adore and love Michael Graziadei. The characters were spot on as were the actors to play them. Some comedies tend to lead up to a funny part or line but so many times I was caught off guard with hilarity. Great movie, hilarious, crude and hope to see more.",1388534400,,379,4.277777777777778
5924090,3,B00EK1KXQG,"Ok the movie was cheesy and the entire movie is sort of ridiculous. I wanted to watch because a lifelong friend had a significant role. He did a great job as far as I'm concerned. Totally believe him as a police man. The writing and the other characters, well cheesy is the only word that comes to mind.  It's not an Academy Award nomination getter it's just a movie you only see ONCE..",1385078400,,386,4.287671232876712
5924091,3,B00EK1KXQG,"If you read the DVD cover you will immediately think about ""Hangover."" Unfortunately the script writing lacks the cleverness and cohesiveness of a ""Hangover"" script. The film is about a British band that try to piece together the events of the previous night in a haphazard fashion. Eddie (Scott Rosa) is the voice of reason and songwriter for the group. Chas (Michael Graziadei) is the drummer who does more drugs than is humanly possible, even for Keith Richards. Toss (Flood Reed) is a crude unlikeable guitarist who's only goal is to use women. Gunther (John Joyce) is the fourth member of the band. The writers ignored him for much of the film. They wake up to a trashed house and a dead guy in the pool. All the action takes place at this one residence.

There are some funny scenes and lines, but over all the movie lacked any type of rhythm. Chas resembled Zach Galifianakis which was a plus, but the added two characters of Toss and Gunther did more to hinder the story than add to it. The band girls were underutilized. The film has a certain amount of crudeness as expected for this genre, with a few scenes being more crude than funny.

Watching a bunch of guys play beer pong is boring. It is an acceptable young adult romp rental at best. Good for a few laughs.

8606210,4,B00EK1KXQG,"At first I didn't like this at all - knock off hangover - bad movie
Then I let it play,
The music is not that bad, (good show for indie bands)
I have no idea who this cast is. (good shot for newbie actors)
Ok so this is clearly not typical indie flick & budget might be a bit higher then usual bad movies.
And the script is a bad weekend at bernie's type.
But overall I want to here the music again",1491350400,,398,3.8072289156626504
