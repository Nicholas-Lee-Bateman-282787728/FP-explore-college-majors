3102609,1,B001370DN8,"I bought this movie not really knowing what to expect.  Hoping that it would be a (rare though it is) ""good"" horror movie.  Wow, I was wrong.

The movie is shown like a flashback.  One girl walks away from the Fun Park after losing 5 of her friends to Bobo the Clown.  I wish I could say something positive about this movie, so I will.  It only cost me $10 to buy.

Now that the good's out of the way, we move on to the bad.  The acting in this movie was mediocre, at best.  You never get a good feel for any of the characters at any point during the movie.  You never get the feeling of ""there's no hope"" for the characters.  The lighting was sub-par most of the times, as it felt like you were watching through a night vision lens.  The story here...well, there really wasn't one.  You learn that Bobo was beaten down in the parking lot after hours one night, and the police never find his body (of which they labeled it as a murder, saying nobody could live from losing so much blood).  You also learn Bobo started out clowning at an early age, and was taken away from his mother shortly afterwards.  That's about it.  You never learn WHY they tried to kill Bobo.  You never learn WHY he's now a deranged killer clown.  You never learn WHY he cuts off the teens faces and wears them (or puts them on a mannequin's head).  All in all, I wish that this movie did not happen.  I would recommend that you avoid this movie if you can.  If you don't...well, you were warned.",1206057600,,1471,4.182142857142857
3102610,5,B001370DN8,"What I liked most about the Stephen King movie / mini-series ""IT"" was the freaky clown that kept showing up (only later to morph into a spider in one of cinema's most bizarre ""what the heck?"" moments!!).  The spider was dumb, but the freaky clown, now that was scary.  I mean, aren't all clowns rather freaky and creepy to begin with?  So along comes THE FUN PARK, based on the popular urban-legend of a haunted amusement park in rural Oklahoma.  If you don't know the story, basically, Bobo killed some folks way back when, and still haunts the abandoned site, waiting for the next batch of brave teens to try and debunk the legend.  In THE FUN PARK, only one survives, but that's more than usual for Bobo.  Overall, the film is well paced and well directed.  Some of the acting is marginal, but certainly not with key roles by teen-movie veterans Randy Wayne and Jillian Murray.  I appreciated that the gore was implied or kept to a minimum, which probably helped the filmmakers get a broader audience and DVD placement, without compromising any of the scares and thrills.",1202083200,,1074,4.645502645502646

8249409,1,B001370DN8,"""The Fun Park"" has some really stupid and boring dialog. It has some very bad cinematography, with the camera constantly zooming in and out (for no apparent reason). The photography draws so much attention to itself, as to be very annoying. The lighting is apparently supposed to be as if the characters are in complete darkness, but we can see them via a night-camera lens, I guess.  It was certainly not clear in the film, so it is sort of baffling. No explanations are provided for any of the clown's (or his son's) motivations. No explanation for the police finding no blood anywhere, or for the missing body of the teen who was shot by the security guard (next to his van). And the teens' van was missing?? Talk about loose ends not being ""tied up""!  Even if (somehow) the clown and his son were mysteriously still alive -- would they have cleaned up all the blood from the grounds, moved the boy's body, moved the teen's van, and disappeared? The whole thing makes no sense-- even if you stretch your imagination and give the writer some slack. ( After all, it is a horror film.) The security guard is his son? Where did that come from? (The security guard was the worst actor of the lot.) Why is the psychiatrist nude and taking a shower early on in the film?  I have no clue. The psychiatrist seems to be just a marginal character and there really is no story line for her. But, we learn miscelaneous stuff about her -- I have no clue as to why. It does not advance the story or provide any useful background. Maybe a whole story line was edited out. Overall, a fairly stupidly-produced film that could have been good in the right hands. The opening sequence photography was eerie , though it is possible it is archival footage. It shows an operating fun park, with children on the rides. Very effective and creepy. If this was filmed by the cinematographer, then he has potential. But the credits that were flashing in a phony flash mode(during the opening footage) were annoying.
Somebody with talent, please re-write and re-direct this film. It has potential to be good. Tobe Hooper's ""The FunHouse"" was a much better film, and I recommend the book upon which that film was based, by Dean Koontz (The Funhouse).It does differ greatly from the film.",1264636800,,2259,4.586633663366337
8249410,1,B001370DN8,"This film looks like it was shot in a single day. One thing that I like to do is look at B movies and see how well they could do with what they had to work with. This movie failed in almost every way.

1. Corny dialogue;
2. Bad acting;
3. Weird cinematography (the film kept switching back and forth in every scence so many times that it made me dizzy to watch it-- there is a way to show characters faces while they are talking without cutting EACH time back to the character).

Save your money and your time",1235260800,,509,4.08
8249411,5,B001370DN8,"This film was good as well with Bobo the Clown terorising the kids that went to the Fun Park.
The kids were playing in the Fun Park when the serurity guard told them to leave and if they came back they would be in so much trouble.
You can guess that the kids did come back because they forgot the camera and one by one they got caught by Bobo the Clown and his son the security guard. Bobo the Clown terrorised the kids and pulled one of the girls skin of her face off.
At the end one of the girls survived but she needs help with her therapist all the time now.

I give this film 5 stars.",1211846400,,589,3.908333333333333
8249412,2,B001370DN8,"What is it about clowns, those face-pained funny looking guys with the big shoots, the balloon animals, and the annoying voices, that if you put a large group of people at a party with a clown, everybody's laughing at his antics. Have you ever been to a children's party where they hired the town clown to entertain? If you have, picture you and that clown alone in a dark room. Would he be so funny then?
The horror genre is full, maybe to full, of zombie and slasher films, really unwanted sequels, and just plain jumbled messes of good films made by good directors who are forced to make changes prior to release (just ask George Romero). The one entity that is overlooked is the ""horror clown"" genre. There hasn't been allot of them, but enough that I want to officially add ""Horror Clowns"" to the list of genres, along side zombies, vampires, and all the rest.  These films can go from good (Clown House), to fair (Fear Of Clowns), gruesome (Dead Clowns), and then there's ""The Fun Park"", the latest killer clown film, direct to video, that has taken it's rightful place in my newly create ""Clown"" genre, the bottom of the funny barrel.
The ""plot"", stolen from about every other film that seems to be released lately, six high school friends decide to take a trek to an amusement park that has been empty for over ten years due to the severe beating of one it's employees, a clown, as he was locking up. It seems our laugh maker, named Bobo, is an urban legend, that annoying story all the locals heard growing up that he still lives there today.
As the film opens, the carnage has ended and the lone survivor Megan (Jillian Murray) is found by the police wandering down a road in shock. She tells her story but the police check the park, and there's no sign that her friends are there, or that anybody was ever there; no footprints, tire tracks, seltzer bottles, nothing. The movie moves back and forth from the psychiatrist working with Megan, and the flashback to the prior night, and the performance ""Bobo"" put on. Without giving spoilers, I'll just say the biggest problem with this movie is too much talking, not enough clown. Too much time is spent on the psychiatrist who sort of believes Megan, and the flashback of the nights festivities. But that isn't even the worst thing. The worst is one the the friends, and each of these film has one; ""The Stoner"", is one of the most annoying people I have seen in the movie in a long time. This actor couldn't act stoned if he WAS stoned. You pray for Bobo to take him out early but no such luck. I was surprised Bobo didn't throw him back. Now that would have been a funny clown.

8249413,2,B001370DN8,"I'm a sucker for any movie that features amusement parks, especially spooky abandoned ones, and clowns. This movie has a good concept, but just can't pull it off.

The plot is not new, but is still interesting: a group of teens decide to check out the abandoned amusement park in their hometown, which happened to be the site of a brutal murder 20 years ago. Like most teenagers in movies today, their exploits are captured on video, making this a sort of Blair Witch hunt in the amusement park. Not surprisingly, they meet up with the baddie, a psycho clown, who then- gasp- kills them all but one girl. The survivor then works with her shrink and the police to piece together what really happened at the park. One thing is for sure, if I disappeared, I wouldn't want this police force looking for me.

This all sounds dandy, but is marred through bad lighting, bad acting/ dialogue, and a general ho-hum approach. The story utilizes a lot of flashbacks, which doesn't really work in this film and instead leaves you going ""What?""

If you're looking for killer clowns, or spooky amusement parks- or just about any kind of movie, for that matter- you could do better than this one.",1206921600,,1181,4.614285714285714
8249414,2,B001370DN8,"I picked this movie up with the hopes of some cool fun park twist and turns.  What could be more fun than watching some teens get chased through an amusement park by a psychopathic killer clown right?!  Well...I wouldn't be able to tell ya cuz this film didn't deliver in that aspect.  It was done in more of a memory sequence, not cool!!  It did not keep my attention, it was pretty much a snoozer.  There were a couple parts that I can recall that were a little squeamish, but other than that, nothing really stood out.  At least it wasn't homemade with a camcorder and 1,000, that's one good thing.  I'd have to say, skip this one......unless of course you LOVE clown movies and collect them.  In that case knock yourself out...no really, knock yourself out! LOL",1206144000,,765,4.492753623188406
8249415,1,B001370DN8,"Wow, I got this movie thinking it would be really good- it's absolutely horrible.  They really could have done so much with this movie.  Most of the middle of the movie when all the action is supposed to be happening- it just loses the interest of the viewer big time.  It's the same stuff over and over again and there is NO suspense.  The acting is pretty bad too. I started to fast forward through parts of this movie because it just went on and on but not in a good way.  I was extremely disappointed with this movie to say the very least.  There was nothing fun about this movie at all. Save your money",1206057600,,607,4.189655172413793
