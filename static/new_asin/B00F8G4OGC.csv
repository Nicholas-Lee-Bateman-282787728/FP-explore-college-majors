The video is so cloudy it is almost a blurr.  I suggest waiting to buy this movie when notified that the video can be seen clearly and thus enjoyed.",1386633600,3,312,4.081967213114754

5970301,1,B00F8G4OGC,I Recieved this DVD in The mail Yesterday and I found Out that it is a Burned Copy. And Also it would not play in my DVD Player. So Save your money.,1398902400,,148,3.65625
5970302,3,B00F8G4OGC,"The first thing that struck me when this arrived was that the cover was obviously not treated to the normal industry standard of a four color printing process.  Rather, it was the product of a colorjet or laserjet printer, prompting me to ask myself ""Did I just buy a bootlegged movie through Amazon?""
OK, so within the packaging, there's a mention of the movie being in public domain, so the movie probably isn't illegal.  However, it's also not completely focused, and regarding the color, I'm reminded of the old Kodak disclaimer ""All dyes fade in time.""
I'd bought this movie as a Christmas gift for my fiancee, and it wasn't until last weekend that we finally watched it.  The last time I saw it was as a double feature at the theatre, along with ""Barry Lyndon"".
There weren't any videotape style glitches in the film, causing confusion as to what happened so as to diffuse the picture image throughout the movie, which could otherwise occur with VHS line resolution loss; so it seems to be a copy from film.
On the plus side, since it underwent no remastering, that also meant that all the original music was still in the movie, unlike the hackjob they did to the ""WKRP"" DVD release, and ""Happy Days"" DVDs from season 2 onward, pasting generic garbage in to avoid music copyrights.",1398643200,,1287,4.6607929515418505
