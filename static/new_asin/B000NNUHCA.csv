It's a game that you get into and it takes over your life. This movie sums up everything that we all love about ultimate. It follows the consistently best team in college ultimate throughout their final years of being the best. Will they get that number one spot again?

Totally recommend this extremely well-made tear-jerker to anyone who wants a good show! AWESOME FILM!",1299110400,,541,4.6947368421052635
