3087636,5,B0012EM5DI,"This season doesn't lack for anything. There is still enough teen angst and sex and violence to please everyone. The characters are all just as strong and interesting. I know, a lot of people are not a fan of Brenda Walsh, myself included, but hey, what can you do? I just ignored her for the most part. Andrea looked ancient in this, which I thought was hilarious. Everything else was enjoyable. Good stories, for the most part. All in all, a good solid and utterly watchable season.",1202947200,3,484,4.574712643678161
3087637,5,B0012EM5DI,"Beverly Hills 90210: The Fourth Season is the year when the gang started college together and hey what's the odds these friends would all end up attending the same college? Anyway season four was an amazing, inspiring, and gutsy season. Kelly and Brenda's friendship was still strained, Andrea became pregnant and got married, and Donna was still a virgin and David couldn't accept it. A lot of reviewers say they hated Brenda but she was probably the most interesting character on the show, this would be Shannen Doherty's last season. This is the best and polished season of the college years so with that being said, I highly recommend it!",1202083200,13,642,4.845454545454546
3087638,5,B0012EM5DI,"I still love this show even after all these years.  I love watching the episodes that I used to watch over and over and this season really takes off.
I love the second episode (The Girl From New York City) where Donna is afraid to tell her mother that she and David are now living together at the beach.  In Strangers In The Night, Andrea finally loses her virginity which becomes an interesting story line and I love Twenty Years Ago Today when Brenda's new love interest proposes to her and she accepts.  Also later in the season we see David begin to use drugs and watch the problems that ensue as a result.  And finally the other two 'shattering' story lines are Brenda's departure, and Andrea giving birth to a little girl.
I'm so glad they brought this out so soon after season 3 and hope this means that season 5 will be out soon too.  I love this programe so much and love watching these discs pile up on my shelves.  I still go back to them every now and then and start over.",1201996800,15,984,4.263440860215054
3087639,3,B0012EM5DI,"I absolutely love this show...it's truly an obsession, but the only reason that I gave it three stars is because I CANNOT stand Brenda.  When the show is on SoapNet, I avoid the seasons with Brenda on it.  I think the 5th season is where it starts getting super good (in my opinion) and who could forget Season 10??  Awww :)  David and Donna were always my favorite.  Until the fifth season comes out, count me out for buying.",1201910400,8,426,4.341772151898734
3087640,4,B0012EM5DI,"The first three seasons of the show were enjoyable, but the premiere of the fourth season marked when I really started to love the show.

I started watching at a very early age, but felt that the characters all came into their own and found their identities in this season.

My absolute favorite story throughout the entire series has been the relationship between Brandon and Kelly.  Up until this point, they'd had a mild flirtation, but were mostly friends (the prom kiss in Season One is my favorite moment between the first and third seasons).  Towards the end of the fourth season, Brandon and Kelly find their spark at the retreat, and a new, short-lived triangle of Brandon/Kelly/Dylan emerges.  And the love between Brandon and Kelly is born.

While the music to the show will undoubtedly be changed, at least to some degree, as have the past seasons, that is a minor issue.  I rated this season as a four star.  It would have gotten five, but once again, it was chalk full of Brenda drama.  I can not stand Brenda.  Never could.  Perhaps I should have rated it with four a half stars since this is her last season.  And thank God for that!",1201392000,8,1149,4.5512195121951216
3087641,5,B0012EM5DI,"Season 4 is my favorite Season of ""90210."" This the best Season of this teen-friendly soapy drama because all the eps seemed much more grittier and realer. And the cast all seemed more confident and sure of themselves, because, by now ""90210"" was a huge worldwide hit!

Here's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tentative-cover/dp/B000VDDE0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tentative cover </a>of this set! This will be an 8-disc set with a total of 31 original eps!

This is the Season 4 Cast of ""90210"" (listed in order of importance:)
Brenda Walsh (played by the Original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty) - The Star
Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) - main cast, 2nd biggest star
Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) - main cast, ""breakout"" star
Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) - main cast
Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) - main cast
Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering) - main cast
David Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) - main cast
Andrea Zuckerman Vasquez (Gabrielle Carteris) - main cast
Nat Bussichio (Joe E. Tata) - supporting character, not in every ep
Cindy Walsh (Carol Potter) - supporting character, not in every ep
Jim Walsh (James Eckhouse) - supporting character, not in every ep
Jesse Vasquez (Mark Damon Espinoza, AKA Mark D. Espinoza) - supporting, not on entire season or in every ep

In this Season I really started to appreciate Andrea. In prior Seasons, she was such a nagging pain-in-the-@ss (not unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-s/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose's </a>&nbsp;Alison.) But in Season 4 her character changed dramatically. Andrea moved out on her own (in the CU dorm) and started dating, and by the end of the Season she was a married mother with a hubby and a baby!

For some reason the character of Brandon also changed a lot during Season 4. He was no longer the sweetie-pie boy-next-door. Brandon seemed somewhat arrogant. Maybe he was upset about still living at home? And, did you notice how in the very beginning of Season 4 his character almost seemed like the odd man out? All the other kids all seemed to have something going on (Steve and the Keg-house, Donna-David and Kelly in their new beach apartment, Bren with her new job, Andrea with her new romance and as usual Dylan was just trying to make it through the night.) But Brandon didn't really have much to say or do. Anywho, I didn't like him as much. Although, Bran was still (by far,) my favorite guy of this super-trendy Zip.

I also enjoyed Season 4 because of Brenda. Dylan was the ""breakout"" star, but Brenda was the fan-favorite because Bren wasn't afraid to show her true feelings or let it all hang out, so to speak. Did you notice how some storylines even mirrored Shannon 's personal life (quickie marriage, nude controversy and getting arrested and the possibility of going to prison.) A very wise person once said that there are no coincidences. And, I tend to agree.

These are the Season 4 eps:

The Girl From New York City

Mr. Walsh Goes to Washington

(Skip this if you don't like reading cryptic text.) As of today the p r*ce of this set is 41. 19. So far, this is the c *eapest set of ""90210."" If you're interested in getting it, I would p *ace my order now. A m@zon has a history of structuring their p r*ces in a really odd way; the p r*ces go up and down, not unlike a pure transient hotel rate. (TV Shows on DVD currently has the A m@zon pr*ce listed for this set as 38. 99, so I'm assuming that it has changed at least once over the past month, already!) By the way, I wouldn't be surprised if eventually A m@zon pulls this paged down as they also have a history of putting up pre-order pages way before the items go on sale only to yank the pages down a couple of weeks later. WTF! What's up with that??

As you know, this was also the final season for Shannen. I really hated to see Bren go, and as Donna said to her in the Season 4 finale, between sobs, ""you're my best friend."" Brenda always added a touch of realism and maybe even a bit of narcissism to the Walsh Home. But alas, poor Shannen left. Season 5 of ""90210"" was nowhere near as interesting or welcoming as Season 4 always was. Maybe because I was never crazy about that little hog, Valerie (""Saved by the Bell"" butterball, Tiffani Thiessen, FKA Tiffani Amber Thiessen.) She was no Brenda. I also wasn't crazy about Kathleen Robertson. Fox took Shannen's salary and divided it among these two and still had (a lot of) money left over!

There has never been another TV show that was able to speak directly to the teen audience as ""90210"" always did!

Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?

More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.

Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Murphy/dp/B0002WZS9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Murphy</a>, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-on-the-Prairie/dp/B000AA4KQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House on the Prairie </a>. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-TV-movies/dp/B000GIXCFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House TV movies </a>even after the series was canceled!

In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Just-Want-to-Have-Fun/dp/B00004Y6BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls Just Want to Have Fun</a>. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B000059PPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers </a>!

In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Class-Beverly-Hills/dp/B0002235LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Class Beverly Hills </a>

A year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/90210/dp/B000H7JCG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">90210 </a>. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!

Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!

Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-Place/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose Place </a>! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.

In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!

Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""

Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!

In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.

Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!

Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""

The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!

Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.

Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!

Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!

The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)

After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""

In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!

What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!

Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",1200355200,22,16899,5.187798603454612

Everyone knows Brenda and Dylan belong together. Kelly is a damn joke. Don't get me started on her escapades through the guys but still being jealous of Brenda after all this time Anyway, I will probably buy seasons 5-10 just have the complete series but not because I care for the story lines. Update: I realized that CBS did not put these shows they gave premission for the production company to put out the shows. This is probably why its editted and the original music is not played.

3087767,5,B0012EM5DI,"The fourth season of Beverly Hills 90210 is the most dramatic yet for the series. Also, I love the fact that the makers have fixed three running problems of the show. One, they stopped making the cast to be so egocentric everywhere it goes to, especially in high school. Making a transition to college environment and allowing the characters to go more or less in separate ways were the best things that ever happened. The less egocentric the show became, the much improved the storylines have been. Two, the series is no longer too white as the makers have started to add more racial colors to the mix, and it has been a better change. Three, in the past, characters have showed up and then dropped out like flies. But in season four, the new and old characters actually have stayed longer and surprisingly made a few cameos. I should add one more delight of the show: season four is the final one for Shannen Dougherty. What a huge relief! I am so sick and tired of her character as she stupidly makes mistakes after mistakes and never grows up. Her holier-than-thou attitude is so annoying and incredibly childish. I am glad the next six seasons will be Brenda Walsh free. As for the rest of the characters, I really thought everybody has matured greatly. However, I must say that intelligence is very sorely lacking among the characters. Out of any, Dylan McKay is probably the biggest idiot (or should I say pseudo-intellectual?) The scam, as revealed in the season ending episode, was so obviously seen in miles coming, and seeing Jim Walsh do his homework on the possible finance backing of Kevin's environment project is appallingly bad and amateurish. That kind of thing never is done this quickly. Worse than that, as we know that anybody can obtain a fake identity along with social security numbers, I am surprised that the way how Suzanne's criminal background check was conducted. Just simply take her fingerprints and run them. No professional scam artist will pull any con job so perfectly without having to serve some time. There must be a record. Also, while we are at it, why not take a DNA sample of the daughter? I mean, Dylan has money; otherwise, he would have left everything to her in his last will and testament. Meanwhile, of any characters, I thought Andrea's was the most dramatic and heartfelt, especially at the end with her pre-maturely born baby. I liked the fact that the makers decided her boyfriend-turned-husband to be Hispanic. That spoke volumes to the change of the show. David's drug addition was also dramatic and very interesting because maintaining celibacy with Donna actually drove him to that point. He did the right thing by allowing his relationship to be ended this way; it's just nearly impossible to sustain it while everybody is at the prime of their lives. Donna is unquestionably the nicest person of any, and I've always been surprised that nobody figured her as an animal lover before season four. Steve Sanders is easily the best character of the show, and he shows the best of his traits. He is the most fun to watch during season four, and his war with the great John Sears has been amazing. That really allowed the drama of the series to evolve in new ways like never before. Finally, Brandon Walsh the everlastingly hypocrite...he sure really solidified his position supremely well. He couldn't have chosen a more perfect profession for himself than politics. It is just so...him. Recall that during the episode, he was dating Lucinda Nicholson, and he finds out that she was married. He actually...went along with it before he found out that she was his professor's wife after all. But...he was very willing to carry on an adulterous affair with her if he didn't know who the husband was. Throughout the season, he acts like he is a Mr. Good Shoes with a moral conscience...I say, ""Baaaaaa."" Give me a break. I am surprised the most at Josh Richland for failing to uncover the fact that Brandon was a convicted drunk driver. That would have been very damaging. Speaking of politics, how in the world that Brandon Walsh is qualified to be picked for the Educational Task Force? Really...Brandon Walsh with no experience in this kind of matter? The Brandon Walsh who doesn't really spend any time when it comes to amelioration of student education? And Brandon Walsh out of 30,000 or so students? You have to be kidding me, that's just equally manipulative as it is to say that Brenda Walsh got away with everything with no punishment. Speaking of manipulation, how about that piece of job on Laura Kingman? That was the single worst piece of handling by the creators of the entire show so far. She was practically normal to me. Tell me, how would you really feel if you were greatly interested in a guy and then find out in the end that he was just using you and also had a girlfriend in the entire time? And tell me, how would you really feel if you gave the performance of a lifetime trying to get the lead part in a play after so much hard work and knew that the part was essentially yours yet to find out in the end that Brenda Walsh, who 100% choked in the final audition, just basically unfairly grabbed it (in real life, I know that the only way she could possibly win it was by sleeping with the director; please don't insult my intelligence either) by getting another chance via coming over to his house at night? Why wasn't there another chance for Laura (and PLEASE! Kelly has absolutely zero ability as an actress; that's why the whole thing was a sham) to make the competition more fair? And watching the way that she got treated in front of everybody else after being fired by Roy Randolph was the most unfair I've seen. I thought her feelings the entire time were perfectly normal, even at times where her frame of mind is a bit out of ordinary. She lost it in the end because the way things have been going have shocked her enough for her to harbor traumatic feelings. Anyway, of all episodes of season four, I thought ""And Did It My Way"" was the best. As usual, the writers of Beverly Hills 90210 did an excellent job of covering so many diverse topics and made the show much interesting to watch. I haven't mentioned Kelly Taylor yet, and she has really grown up after three season and matured. Her relationship with Dylan is interesting to observe; it is much more mature and sensible, almost like the real thing as compared with other TV-based relationships. I liked the specials of season four: The Loves of Season 4 (What happened to that New York girl?) and A Look Back with Charles Rosin. All in all, season four of Beverly Hills 90210 is easily the best yet.",1289865600,,6645,4.632203389830509

1.  Doesn't have original soundtracks
2.  Is not restored.  Looks grainy",1259020800,2,120,5.157894736842105
3087770,4,B0012EM5DI,"Yes i'm a guilty watcher of 90210, thought to be all about the glam and glitz of living life in Beverly Hills. Well thats true to a very small extent. I just turned 34 so when the show came on in 1990 i was 15 and a sophomore in high schoo, so it really fit the bill for me. Well after watching the show for year upon year, the show became touch and go when they finally graduated, so i caught it when i could, and saw lots of episodes through the late 90's. Actually some of my favorite episodes came in the later seasons, when Valerie (Tiffani Theisenn) came into the picture, spicing things up a bit with a new kind of Vixen character. Here are some things i like(d) and dislike(d) about the main characters, sorry i'm not going season by season it would take forever.

Dylan-Luke Perry would have to be my favorite simply because he's the rebel who doesnt show much emotion, but is still an all around cool guy, and gives the show the much needed James Dean kind of edge. His battles with being car jacked, his father dying, being rich, and always seeming to find trouble made the show not your everyday teeny bopper high school tv series. To bad he left after the sixth season.

Kelly-I like Kelly simply because she was always thought to be a bit trampish but isnt, she's really the nicest down to earth girl on the show(and in real life). Also yes she's hot even to this day pushing 40 years old. She also added ""good"" drama to the show by not really letting anything stop her and always maintained a head strong attitude.

David- David is probably the least talented actor of the series, but he gives it kind of a boyish innocents and even in the later college years has all the temptation that he had in high school, just on a different level. Some of my favorite episodes are with him in this season are his battle with drugs, actually its the best he did probably in all the seasons that he's in.

Andrea-Enh, the Jewish girl from the poor part of town, i never really cared for her character because she's always to critical of every single little detail of life, also her poor me, and anti-semitism really gets old throughout. Also much like Brandon her goals for perfection wane on you a bit throughout the years of the show.

Steve-The good ole, big man(jock styled) guy on campus. Steve never seemed to have a steady girlfriend(except Celeste) but always had good intentions, sometimes thanks to his good buddy Brandon. Also he was always picked on and never really given a lot of credit, or a lot of episodes that really focused on just him. Very likable guy.

Donna-Don't get me started on Tori Spelling, lets put it this way, she never really made it on the show, just there as the other peoples friends and davids gf. To goofy for my taste and she really didn't bring anything to the table except that guys during the years mistreated her. So being the producers daughter didn't help, hense why she is still on the series today i'm sure.

Jim and Cindy-Ennh they have there moments as parents, but anything in the show that revolves around them seems to Seventh Heavenish for me. Thats where a lot of the shows like that, Felicity, and Dawsons Creek stemmed from, the good ole Walshes. As parents they were ok, but weren't to pivetal in the success of the show itself.

Brenda-Oh my my, drama queen Brenda. She had more drama in her life than 4,000 amateur movie stars trying to make it in Hollywood at once. Wine wine wine, moan moan moan, argue, argue, argue, ask Brandon for advice, and yell. Other than that she was definately the most annoying and whoas me character on the show, could she act(yes), but in real life i hear she's even worse than Tori Spelling. But she did bring something to the show even though i hate to admit it.

Last but not least good ole, angel, perfectionist, womanizer Brandon Walsh-I like and hate his character a lot, if thats possible. I like the fact he is definitely the comic relief of the show and along with Dylan is one of the best actors on the series. BUT. He has probably kissed more girls than any guy in porn has had sex with them. I swear to god every other disc he finds some new girl that falls at his feet or wants to go to bed with him. The thing i do like about him, he does try to do things right, a little TO right soemtimes. But Brandon is definitely the center of attention for the whole show, and it probably would have never been as big without him. Much like Micheal J. Fox(Alex P Keaton) in family ties, brought the show stellar reviews and made it huge success.

Many more stars that were cast throughout were very good and brought a new flavor to the show. But my review  would take 2 months to right if i tried to remember them all. I chose to review this season because its the one i'm on, and as i said i'm not reviewing every single one. The perks of this season, as mentioned were David getting into drugs, Andrea being pregnant, all the back and forth taboo relationships between Brandon and his women, and Dylans many issues that still prevail. I would suggest if you've never seen the show to start from the beginning, although if u know the story and have watched it from its inception, try starting from the middle of season 3 and going up. To me its best when they get out of high school and out into the real world. Also here's some data you maybe find interesting from when the show started in 1990 about the star's real ages, some hide it well, and some didnt. Enjoy all the seasons they are really addictive, heck some even pertanant to my life now at 34.

Luke Perry (Dylan)-Born 1965, in Mainsfield Ohio- About 25 when the show began.
Jason Priestly-(Brandon) Born 1969, in Vancouver British Columbia- About 20 when the show began.
Brian Austin Green-(David) Born 1973, Van Nuys California- Around 17 when the show began.
Jennie Garth(Kelly) Born 1972, in Urbana Illinois- Around 18 when the show began.
Ian Ziering (Steve) Born 1964, in Newark New Jersey- Around 26 when the show began.
Tori Spelling(Donna) Born 1973, in Los Angeles Cal.- Around 17 when the show began.
Gabrielle Carteris(Andrea) Born 1961- in Scottsdale Arizona-around 29 when the show started.
Tiffani Thiessen *main character in 1994*- Born 1974- Long Beach California- 20 at her start.

So this is just some interesting facts in case your new, or have never seen the show and thought they all really started out as teenagers. :D",1251244800,3,6399,4.463644140290847
3087771,5,B0012EM5DI,"Season 4 of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" brings the gang to California University, where they experience college life and face a new set of more adult challenges. Brandon gets involved in campus politics and begins an illicit affair with a 26-year-old anthropology professor. Brenda almost elopes in Las Vegas with a guy she barely knows, and eventually seeks solace in the theatre. Kelly is constantly frustrated by her relationship with Dylan, who loves playing the role of big brother to his newly-discovered eight-year-old sister. Donna and David's relationship hits some major bumps in the road, especially when David becomes addicted to drugs. Steve pledges a fraternity and winds up in all sorts of trouble, and Andrea shocks everyone by getting knocked up and married all in one season. Never a dull moment on ""90210!""

Unfortunately, though, Season 4 was Shannen Doherty's final season playing Brenda. She never returned to the show, and the zip code was never the same without her. I've enjoyed watching the first four seasons on DVD, but I think I'm done...without Brenda Walsh, there's just no point.",1246233600,5,1106,5.144444444444445

3087790,3,B0012EM5DI,"I was 12 when ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" premiered.  The show and it's actors quickly became my whole life.  The show was a barometer of current events, fashion, the political climate (hence Brandon Walsh's visit to Washington, DC to meet Bill Clinton)..if it was happening at the time, it was on ""90210"".  Especially the music.  WHERE THE HELL IS THE MUSIC???  A huge part of the landscape in the late 1980's-early 1990's was the music-pop, hip-hop, New Jack Swing, and the beginning of the grunge era- and how it's influence spilled over into fashion, language, etc.  Yet CBS apparently thought that to the fans of the show, any DVD, even one with horrible public domain music, was better than no DVD at all.  All those scenes at the Peach Pit, with Jeremy Jordan, Color Me Badd, Shanice, Brian McKnight playing on the jukebox?  You'll have to suffer through cheesy imitation-doo-wop instead.  Brenda's breakup with Dylan?  Remember how she listened to REM's ""Losing My Religion"" over and over because it was playing in his car?  You'll have to remember it, because it's not here.  The difference is even move glaringly obvious in this season as David gets a piano and entertains the gang with some popular tunes.  Instead of the footage aired, some grainy cutting-room floor footage was used, with music straight out of a player piano or nickelodeon. My gripe with the DVDs is with this series in general, not with this specific boxed set.  Overall, the picture, sound quality, and special features are good, and there are even a few commentaries that are particularly entertaining. But as one who likes to look back and reminisce on my younger years, and how ""90210"" fit into that, something's  not just missing...it's been rewritten.",1215043200,14,1734,4.9106529209622
3087791,1,B0012EM5DI,"maybe if everyone stops buying the dvds they'll stop putting them out with cut scenes and no music. the show is boring to watch without the music. also most episodes are just odd with all the cut scenes. half the time I wonder if I missed something. why are they cutting the scenes? are they just bored? or to lazy to take the music out so they just hit delete? either way I am not buying anymore. I'll rent them. they aren't worth it to own. or better yet watch it on tv for free, not cut, with the music!",1214956800,7,506,4.07
3087792,4,B0012EM5DI,Ok so the 90210 DVD's aren't perfect. No reason to beat a dead horse on that. The characters and stories are what's important and I've had a blast going down memory lane. Remeber sydication only lasts so long. I'm happy to have these forever. I've found myself going through the discs in rapid succession as I'm addicted all over again.

3087793,4,B0012EM5DI,"Towards the end of this season, it was obvious that Brenda had grown distanced from the rest of the gang, and towards the end there everybody was being a jerk to her. They actually believed that Brenda slept with the director of the play just to get the part. And then Steve has the nerve to tell her that he was ""your brother's friend, not yours."" I was like, ""WHAT?"" Well then what the hell did the last 4 years mean to you? Brenda stood up for him in Season 2 when that gold digging bimbo was after him and called herself his friend. I guess it just goes to show that people move on. And then there was Kelly, with her on-again, off-again friendship with Brenda. I was so glad when her and Dylan broke up, she was getting on my last nerve this season. Anyway, the point is, Shannen Doherty was the best part of this show and after she left, it was downhill until the series finale.",1213833600,7,884,4.205882352941177

3087795,2,B0012EM5DI,"I was extremely disappointed in the Season 4 DVDs.  I cannot tolerate all of the scenes that they cut.  The storylines don't even make sense when they cut out those scenes.  I agree that I can tolerate some of the music being different, however in some of the episodes it is a little ridiculous.  For example, in the episode where Brenda flashes back to the 60's, the 60's music is an integral part of the episode.  I think they completely ruined that episode by changing the music.  And in the episode where the KEG house throws a 70's party, they couldn't get the rights to any 70's music????  The music they use just doesn't make sense and doesn't fit with the episodes.  Most disappointing to me was they changed the comedians that did the ""Everything you need to know about Season 4"".  I don't know where they got those two from, but they were not even close to being funny, they were just uncomfortable to watch.  I very much enjoyed the duo from Best Week Ever they have had for past seasons, they were hilarious!  It seems as if every season they cut out more and more things out of the DVDs, I guess to cut costs.  I doubt if I will purchase any more in the future.",1210723200,8,1174,4.334862385321101

I think the producers took the same care with all of the changes made in order to release the DVD's as they did when the original shows were made. If you are a true 90210 fan, none of the changes will bother you. They don't bother me none!",1210636800,,374,4.208333333333333
3087807,5,B0012EM5DI,"Beverly Hills, 90210 is one of my favorite shows of all-time. The friendships, the relationships, the drama..it all worked so well. I was a big fan of Brenda, but I still enjoyed the show very much after her character did not return. There are plenty of reviews for this season that are detailed, well thought out, and better than mine would be. My real reason for writing this review is because I have a music question about one of the songs used on the DVD:

 I was very moved by one of the songs used in an episode. I've been trying to find the song by doing lyric searches, but I have had no luck so far. The episode the song is on is called ""Somewhere In The World It's Christmas,"" and the song is playing during the scene where the Walsh family is on a plane to Hawaii, but there is trouble and they need to do an emergency landing. It starts out as a traditional Hallelujah, but then the vocalist adds her own lyrics. Like I said, I've been searching for days with now luck. Please help me out if
 you can!",1210464000,2,1013,4.211340206185567
3087808,3,B0012EM5DI,"Beverly Hills The Fourth Season marks for the last season of the talented Shannen Doherty. That in itself make this series a downer. The transition from high school to college is well done but there are two main problems with this series and I have have noticed series 3. Yes the original music has been changed which is a massive pain as some of the songs that have been included do not match the scene it's referring to. Take episode 4 ""Greek Life"" There is a 70's party and the music that is used is not from the 70's at all. The worst thing though is there are scenes missing. Also from ""Greek Life"" there is a scene where Andrea and the girls attend a candle light ceremony and she is wearing the Jewish Star which causes a problem within the sorority. This scene has been completely left out and it jumps to Leslie from the sorority going to Andrea's dorm to confront her. I was a massive fan of this show and used to tape it each week and watch it a number of times so for me the deleted scene was very obvious.  This is also the case in season 3 ""Prom"" 2 scenes were deleted where Tony Miller was at the table bragging how he got a key for a room for him and Brenda. Brenda overhears this and tells him in your dreams. There is also a scene missing where Dylan goes up to Brenda's table and asks her to dance. For me that was massive at the time as I was a huge fan of Brenda and Dylan's relationship and was so disappointed to see if didn't make the DVD, it just shows them on the dance floor. What is with that. Why are they cutting out scenes????? Apart from that the old memories are there and as it was a great show so I will try and not get to annoyed with the missing scenes...",1210464000,8,1692,4.111782477341389

It does not bother me that the episodes are cut or that the music is changed because I saw the episodes on tv but I was not an avid follower of the show. I have all seasons and plan on buying the rest because the stories are really good.

The one scene the you could tell they chance the music was when Brandon met the ice skater and they were in the ring skating. The song they replaced it with lost the moment, however all other songs seemed to be ok. I am worried how they'll release the song with the peach pit after dark seeing that they had quite a few music acts. Hopefully they will come out in a timely manner.

I love the show and I think each season was different and good for their own reasons.  I think that after Brenda left the show did go downhill.  Even if you don't like Shannen, she is a good actress and the character of Brenda brought a lot to the show.  Nonetheless, I still liked the show after she left, just not as much.  Season 4 is great.  I am not going to write a long drawn out review of the season because a lot of other reviewers have already done that.  These reviews are supposed to be partly about the DVD itself and I have a huge problem with it, which is the only reason I only gave it 3 stars.  Did anyone else notice that they cut out huge scenes from some of the episodes, namely the episode where they go out for the Greek life.  They completly cut out the end, as well as a section in the middle where Aundrea wore her Star of David to the Candle Light Ceremony.  It took a lot away from the episode.  I have not watched the whole set yet, but hope that they don't cut anymore important or any scenes out.  It was disappointing.",1209686400,8,1198,4.068376068376068
3087815,4,B0012EM5DI,"Ok, this is it-No more Brenda. To me, the show begins its decline once she leaves. I can't believe how many people hate this character-she was so honest and straight-forward. In the early episodes Dylan was a little bit of a wimp with her and she takes advantage, but COME ON-Kelly was a mega-bitch who stole her boyfriend and then got jealous whenever they were in each others company-it is very apparent in season four. Brenda and Dylan had the best chemistry by far. Being a fellow Class of '93 myself-my friends and I were obessed with the first three seasons-I even used to tape them on VCR tapes back in the day. Now I can own the DVDS!! However, my collection stops with season four-I can't even look at ""Valerie"" and Claire is soooooooooo annonying!! How the show survived six more seasons without Brenda is beyond me!!

I love the second episode (The Girl From New York City) where Donna is afraid to tell her mother that she and David are now living together at the beach.  In Strangers In The Night, Andrea finally loses her virginity which becomes an interesting story line and I love Twenty Years Ago Today when Brenda's new love interest proposes to her and she accepts.  Also later in the season we see David begin to use drugs and watch the problems that ensue as a result.  And finally the other two 'shattering' story lines are Brenda's departure, and Andrea giving birth to a little girl.

3322137,4,B0012EM5DI,"The first three seasons of the show were enjoyable, but the premiere of the fourth season marked when I really started to love the show.

I started watching at a very early age, but felt that the characters all came into their own and found their identities in this season.

My absolute favorite story throughout the entire series has been the relationship between Brandon and Kelly.  Up until this point, they'd had a mild flirtation, but were mostly friends (the prom kiss in Season One is my favorite moment between the first and third seasons).  Towards the end of the fourth season, Brandon and Kelly find their spark at the retreat, and a new, short-lived triangle of Brandon/Kelly/Dylan emerges.  And the love between Brandon and Kelly is born.

While the music to the show will undoubtedly be changed, at least to some degree, as have the past seasons, that is a minor issue.  I rated this season as a four star.  It would have gotten five, but once again, it was chalk full of Brenda drama.  I can not stand Brenda.  Never could.  Perhaps I should have rated it with four a half stars since this is her last season.  And thank God for that!",1201392000,8,1149,4.5512195121951216
3322138,5,B0012EM5DI,"Season 4 is my favorite Season of ""90210."" This the best Season of this teen-friendly soapy drama because all the eps seemed much more grittier and realer. And the cast all seemed more confident and sure of themselves, because, by now ""90210"" was a huge worldwide hit!

Here's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tentative-cover/dp/B000VDDE0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tentative cover </a>of this set! This will be an 8-disc set with a total of 31 original eps!

This is the Season 4 Cast of ""90210"" (listed in order of importance:)
Brenda Walsh (played by the Original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty) - The Star
Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) - main cast, 2nd biggest star
Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) - main cast, ""breakout"" star
Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) - main cast
Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) - main cast
Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering) - main cast
David Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) - main cast
Andrea Zuckerman Vasquez (Gabrielle Carteris) - main cast
Nat Bussichio (Joe E. Tata) - supporting character, not in every ep
Cindy Walsh (Carol Potter) - supporting character, not in every ep
Jim Walsh (James Eckhouse) - supporting character, not in every ep
Jesse Vasquez (Mark Damon Espinoza, AKA Mark D. Espinoza) - supporting, not on entire season or in every ep

In this Season I really started to appreciate Andrea. In prior Seasons, she was such a nagging pain-in-the-@ss (not unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-s/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose's </a>&nbsp;Alison.) But in Season 4 her character changed dramatically. Andrea moved out on her own (in the CU dorm) and started dating, and by the end of the Season she was a married mother with a hubby and a baby!

For some reason the character of Brandon also changed a lot during Season 4. He was no longer the sweetie-pie boy-next-door. Brandon seemed somewhat arrogant. Maybe he was upset about still living at home? And, did you notice how in the very beginning of Season 4 his character almost seemed like the odd man out? All the other kids all seemed to have something going on (Steve and the Keg-house, Donna-David and Kelly in their new beach apartment, Bren with her new job, Andrea with her new romance and as usual Dylan was just trying to make it through the night.) But Brandon didn't really have much to say or do. Anywho, I didn't like him as much. Although, Bran was still (by far,) my favorite guy of this super-trendy Zip.

I also enjoyed Season 4 because of Brenda. Dylan was the ""breakout"" star, but Brenda was the fan-favorite because Bren wasn't afraid to show her true feelings or let it all hang out, so to speak. Did you notice how some storylines even mirrored Shannon 's personal life (quickie marriage, nude controversy and getting arrested and the possibility of going to prison.) A very wise person once said that there are no coincidences. And, I tend to agree.

These are the Season 4 eps:

(Skip this if you don't like reading cryptic text.) As of today the p r*ce of this set is 41. 19. So far, this is the c *eapest set of ""90210."" If you're interested in getting it, I would p *ace my order now. A m@zon has a history of structuring their p r*ces in a really odd way; the p r*ces go up and down, not unlike a pure transient hotel rate. (TV Shows on DVD currently has the A m@zon pr*ce listed for this set as 38. 99, so I'm assuming that it has changed at least once over the past month, already!) By the way, I wouldn't be surprised if eventually A m@zon pulls this paged down as they also have a history of putting up pre-order pages way before the items go on sale only to yank the pages down a couple of weeks later. WTF! What's up with that??

As you know, this was also the final season for Shannen. I really hated to see Bren go, and as Donna said to her in the Season 4 finale, between sobs, ""you're my best friend."" Brenda always added a touch of realism and maybe even a bit of narcissism to the Walsh Home. But alas, poor Shannen left. Season 5 of ""90210"" was nowhere near as interesting or welcoming as Season 4 always was. Maybe because I was never crazy about that little hog, Valerie (""Saved by the Bell"" butterball, Tiffani Thiessen, FKA Tiffani Amber Thiessen.) She was no Brenda. I also wasn't crazy about Kathleen Robertson. Fox took Shannen's salary and divided it among these two and still had (a lot of) money left over!

There has never been another TV show that was able to speak directly to the teen audience as ""90210"" always did!

Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?

More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.

Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Murphy/dp/B0002WZS9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Murphy</a>, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-on-the-Prairie/dp/B000AA4KQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House on the Prairie </a>. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-House-TV-movies/dp/B000GIXCFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little House TV movies </a>even after the series was canceled!

In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Just-Want-to-Have-Fun/dp/B00004Y6BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls Just Want to Have Fun</a>. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B000059PPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers </a>!

In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Class-Beverly-Hills/dp/B0002235LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Class Beverly Hills </a>

A year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/90210/dp/B000H7JCG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">90210 </a>. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!

Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!

Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melrose-Place/dp/B000H7JCGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melrose Place </a>! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.

In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!

Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""

Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!

In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.

Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!

Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""

The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!

Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.

Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!

Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!

The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)

After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""

In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!

What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!

Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",1200355200,22,16899,5.187798603454612

3322187,2,B0012EM5DI,"Aside from missing scenes, this season started out great but in the middle of it started to get boring. Also when the dvd starts their do not copy credits it is in Spanish. Why? I realized why I stoppd watching after the writers refused to bring Brenda and Dylan back together after they clearly showed they still loves each other this season. Everyone knows Brenda and Dylan belong together. Kelly is a damn joke. Don't get me started on her escapades through the guys but still being jealous of Brenda after all this time Anyway, I will probably buy seasons 5-10 just have the complete series but not because I care for the story lines. Update: I realized that CBS did not put these shows they gave premission for the production company to put out the shows. This is probably why its editted and the original music is not played.

3322264,5,B0012EM5DI,"The fourth season of Beverly Hills 90210 is the most dramatic yet for the series. Also, I love the fact that the makers have fixed three running problems of the show. One, they stopped making the cast to be so egocentric everywhere it goes to, especially in high school. Making a transition to college environment and allowing the characters to go more or less in separate ways were the best things that ever happened. The less egocentric the show became, the much improved the storylines have been. Two, the series is no longer too white as the makers have started to add more racial colors to the mix, and it has been a better change. Three, in the past, characters have showed up and then dropped out like flies. But in season four, the new and old characters actually have stayed longer and surprisingly made a few cameos. I should add one more delight of the show: season four is the final one for Shannen Dougherty. What a huge relief! I am so sick and tired of her character as she stupidly makes mistakes after mistakes and never grows up. Her holier-than-thou attitude is so annoying and incredibly childish. I am glad the next six seasons will be Brenda Walsh free. As for the rest of the characters, I really thought everybody has matured greatly. However, I must say that intelligence is very sorely lacking among the characters. Out of any, Dylan McKay is probably the biggest idiot (or should I say pseudo-intellectual?) The scam, as revealed in the season ending episode, was so obviously seen in miles coming, and seeing Jim Walsh do his homework on the possible finance backing of Kevin's environment project is appallingly bad and amateurish. That kind of thing never is done this quickly. Worse than that, as we know that anybody can obtain a fake identity along with social security numbers, I am surprised that the way how Suzanne's criminal background check was conducted. Just simply take her fingerprints and run them. No professional scam artist will pull any con job so perfectly without having to serve some time. There must be a record. Also, while we are at it, why not take a DNA sample of the daughter? I mean, Dylan has money; otherwise, he would have left everything to her in his last will and testament. Meanwhile, of any characters, I thought Andrea's was the most dramatic and heartfelt, especially at the end with her pre-maturely born baby. I liked the fact that the makers decided her boyfriend-turned-husband to be Hispanic. That spoke volumes to the change of the show. David's drug addition was also dramatic and very interesting because maintaining celibacy with Donna actually drove him to that point. He did the right thing by allowing his relationship to be ended this way; it's just nearly impossible to sustain it while everybody is at the prime of their lives. Donna is unquestionably the nicest person of any, and I've always been surprised that nobody figured her as an animal lover before season four. Steve Sanders is easily the best character of the show, and he shows the best of his traits. He is the most fun to watch during season four, and his war with the great John Sears has been amazing. That really allowed the drama of the series to evolve in new ways like never before. Finally, Brandon Walsh the everlastingly hypocrite...he sure really solidified his position supremely well. He couldn't have chosen a more perfect profession for himself than politics. It is just so...him. Recall that during the episode, he was dating Lucinda Nicholson, and he finds out that she was married. He actually...went along with it before he found out that she was his professor's wife after all. But...he was very willing to carry on an adulterous affair with her if he didn't know who the husband was. Throughout the season, he acts like he is a Mr. Good Shoes with a moral conscience...I say, ""Baaaaaa."" Give me a break. I am surprised the most at Josh Richland for failing to uncover the fact that Brandon was a convicted drunk driver. That would have been very damaging. Speaking of politics, how in the world that Brandon Walsh is qualified to be picked for the Educational Task Force? Really...Brandon Walsh with no experience in this kind of matter? The Brandon Walsh who doesn't really spend any time when it comes to amelioration of student education? And Brandon Walsh out of 30,000 or so students? You have to be kidding me, that's just equally manipulative as it is to say that Brenda Walsh got away with everything with no punishment. Speaking of manipulation, how about that piece of job on Laura Kingman? That was the single worst piece of handling by the creators of the entire show so far. She was practically normal to me. Tell me, how would you really feel if you were greatly interested in a guy and then find out in the end that he was just using you and also had a girlfriend in the entire time? And tell me, how would you really feel if you gave the performance of a lifetime trying to get the lead part in a play after so much hard work and knew that the part was essentially yours yet to find out in the end that Brenda Walsh, who 100% choked in the final audition, just basically unfairly grabbed it (in real life, I know that the only way she could possibly win it was by sleeping with the director; please don't insult my intelligence either) by getting another chance via coming over to his house at night? Why wasn't there another chance for Laura (and PLEASE! Kelly has absolutely zero ability as an actress; that's why the whole thing was a sham) to make the competition more fair? And watching the way that she got treated in front of everybody else after being fired by Roy Randolph was the most unfair I've seen. I thought her feelings the entire time were perfectly normal, even at times where her frame of mind is a bit out of ordinary. She lost it in the end because the way things have been going have shocked her enough for her to harbor traumatic feelings. Anyway, of all episodes of season four, I thought ""And Did It My Way"" was the best. As usual, the writers of Beverly Hills 90210 did an excellent job of covering so many diverse topics and made the show much interesting to watch. I haven't mentioned Kelly Taylor yet, and she has really grown up after three season and matured. Her relationship with Dylan is interesting to observe; it is much more mature and sensible, almost like the real thing as compared with other TV-based relationships. I liked the specials of season four: The Loves of Season 4 (What happened to that New York girl?) and A Look Back with Charles Rosin. All in all, season four of Beverly Hills 90210 is easily the best yet.",1289865600,,6645,4.632203389830509

3322266,2,B0012EM5DI,"Great season, but it lacks 2 major components:

1.  Doesn't have original soundtracks
2.  Is not restored.  Looks grainy",1259020800,2,120,5.157894736842105
3322267,4,B0012EM5DI,"Yes i'm a guilty watcher of 90210, thought to be all about the glam and glitz of living life in Beverly Hills. Well thats true to a very small extent. I just turned 34 so when the show came on in 1990 i was 15 and a sophomore in high schoo, so it really fit the bill for me. Well after watching the show for year upon year, the show became touch and go when they finally graduated, so i caught it when i could, and saw lots of episodes through the late 90's. Actually some of my favorite episodes came in the later seasons, when Valerie (Tiffani Theisenn) came into the picture, spicing things up a bit with a new kind of Vixen character. Here are some things i like(d) and dislike(d) about the main characters, sorry i'm not going season by season it would take forever.

Dylan-Luke Perry would have to be my favorite simply because he's the rebel who doesnt show much emotion, but is still an all around cool guy, and gives the show the much needed James Dean kind of edge. His battles with being car jacked, his father dying, being rich, and always seeming to find trouble made the show not your everyday teeny bopper high school tv series. To bad he left after the sixth season.

Kelly-I like Kelly simply because she was always thought to be a bit trampish but isnt, she's really the nicest down to earth girl on the show(and in real life). Also yes she's hot even to this day pushing 40 years old. She also added ""good"" drama to the show by not really letting anything stop her and always maintained a head strong attitude.

David- David is probably the least talented actor of the series, but he gives it kind of a boyish innocents and even in the later college years has all the temptation that he had in high school, just on a different level. Some of my favorite episodes are with him in this season are his battle with drugs, actually its the best he did probably in all the seasons that he's in.

Andrea-Enh, the Jewish girl from the poor part of town, i never really cared for her character because she's always to critical of every single little detail of life, also her poor me, and anti-semitism really gets old throughout. Also much like Brandon her goals for perfection wane on you a bit throughout the years of the show.

Steve-The good ole, big man(jock styled) guy on campus. Steve never seemed to have a steady girlfriend(except Celeste) but always had good intentions, sometimes thanks to his good buddy Brandon. Also he was always picked on and never really given a lot of credit, or a lot of episodes that really focused on just him. Very likable guy.

Donna-Don't get me started on Tori Spelling, lets put it this way, she never really made it on the show, just there as the other peoples friends and davids gf. To goofy for my taste and she really didn't bring anything to the table except that guys during the years mistreated her. So being the producers daughter didn't help, hense why she is still on the series today i'm sure.

Jim and Cindy-Ennh they have there moments as parents, but anything in the show that revolves around them seems to Seventh Heavenish for me. Thats where a lot of the shows like that, Felicity, and Dawsons Creek stemmed from, the good ole Walshes. As parents they were ok, but weren't to pivetal in the success of the show itself.

Brenda-Oh my my, drama queen Brenda. She had more drama in her life than 4,000 amateur movie stars trying to make it in Hollywood at once. Wine wine wine, moan moan moan, argue, argue, argue, ask Brandon for advice, and yell. Other than that she was definately the most annoying and whoas me character on the show, could she act(yes), but in real life i hear she's even worse than Tori Spelling. But she did bring something to the show even though i hate to admit it.

Last but not least good ole, angel, perfectionist, womanizer Brandon Walsh-I like and hate his character a lot, if thats possible. I like the fact he is definitely the comic relief of the show and along with Dylan is one of the best actors on the series. BUT. He has probably kissed more girls than any guy in porn has had sex with them. I swear to god every other disc he finds some new girl that falls at his feet or wants to go to bed with him. The thing i do like about him, he does try to do things right, a little TO right soemtimes. But Brandon is definitely the center of attention for the whole show, and it probably would have never been as big without him. Much like Micheal J. Fox(Alex P Keaton) in family ties, brought the show stellar reviews and made it huge success.

Many more stars that were cast throughout were very good and brought a new flavor to the show. But my review  would take 2 months to right if i tried to remember them all. I chose to review this season because its the one i'm on, and as i said i'm not reviewing every single one. The perks of this season, as mentioned were David getting into drugs, Andrea being pregnant, all the back and forth taboo relationships between Brandon and his women, and Dylans many issues that still prevail. I would suggest if you've never seen the show to start from the beginning, although if u know the story and have watched it from its inception, try starting from the middle of season 3 and going up. To me its best when they get out of high school and out into the real world. Also here's some data you maybe find interesting from when the show started in 1990 about the star's real ages, some hide it well, and some didnt. Enjoy all the seasons they are really addictive, heck some even pertanant to my life now at 34.

Luke Perry (Dylan)-Born 1965, in Mainsfield Ohio- About 25 when the show began.
Jason Priestly-(Brandon) Born 1969, in Vancouver British Columbia- About 20 when the show began.
Brian Austin Green-(David) Born 1973, Van Nuys California- Around 17 when the show began.
Jennie Garth(Kelly) Born 1972, in Urbana Illinois- Around 18 when the show began.
Ian Ziering (Steve) Born 1964, in Newark New Jersey- Around 26 when the show began.
Tori Spelling(Donna) Born 1973, in Los Angeles Cal.- Around 17 when the show began.
Gabrielle Carteris(Andrea) Born 1961- in Scottsdale Arizona-around 29 when the show started.
Tiffani Thiessen *main character in 1994*- Born 1974- Long Beach California- 20 at her start.

So this is just some interesting facts in case your new, or have never seen the show and thought they all really started out as teenagers. :D",1251244800,3,6399,4.463644140290847
3322268,5,B0012EM5DI,"Season 4 of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" brings the gang to California University, where they experience college life and face a new set of more adult challenges. Brandon gets involved in campus politics and begins an illicit affair with a 26-year-old anthropology professor. Brenda almost elopes in Las Vegas with a guy she barely knows, and eventually seeks solace in the theatre. Kelly is constantly frustrated by her relationship with Dylan, who loves playing the role of big brother to his newly-discovered eight-year-old sister. Donna and David's relationship hits some major bumps in the road, especially when David becomes addicted to drugs. Steve pledges a fraternity and winds up in all sorts of trouble, and Andrea shocks everyone by getting knocked up and married all in one season. Never a dull moment on ""90210!""

Unfortunately, though, Season 4 was Shannen Doherty's final season playing Brenda. She never returned to the show, and the zip code was never the same without her. I've enjoyed watching the first four seasons on DVD, but I think I'm done...without Brenda Walsh, there's just no point.",1246233600,5,1106,5.144444444444445

I thought the music changes in the 1st 3 seasons were bad enough, but now there are ENTIRE scenes missing! The worst part is that they show them in the end credits! Paramount Studios needs to give us what we want and deserve. Either play it all, in it's original music and scenes, or not at all.

3322287,3,B0012EM5DI,"I was 12 when ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" premiered.  The show and it's actors quickly became my whole life.  The show was a barometer of current events, fashion, the political climate (hence Brandon Walsh's visit to Washington, DC to meet Bill Clinton)..if it was happening at the time, it was on ""90210"".  Especially the music.  WHERE THE HELL IS THE MUSIC???  A huge part of the landscape in the late 1980's-early 1990's was the music-pop, hip-hop, New Jack Swing, and the beginning of the grunge era- and how it's influence spilled over into fashion, language, etc.  Yet CBS apparently thought that to the fans of the show, any DVD, even one with horrible public domain music, was better than no DVD at all.  All those scenes at the Peach Pit, with Jeremy Jordan, Color Me Badd, Shanice, Brian McKnight playing on the jukebox?  You'll have to suffer through cheesy imitation-doo-wop instead.  Brenda's breakup with Dylan?  Remember how she listened to REM's ""Losing My Religion"" over and over because it was playing in his car?  You'll have to remember it, because it's not here.  The difference is even move glaringly obvious in this season as David gets a piano and entertains the gang with some popular tunes.  Instead of the footage aired, some grainy cutting-room floor footage was used, with music straight out of a player piano or nickelodeon. My gripe with the DVDs is with this series in general, not with this specific boxed set.  Overall, the picture, sound quality, and special features are good, and there are even a few commentaries that are particularly entertaining. But as one who likes to look back and reminisce on my younger years, and how ""90210"" fit into that, something's  not just missing...it's been rewritten.",1215043200,14,1734,4.9106529209622

I'll rent them. they aren't worth it to own. or better yet watch it on tv for free, not cut, with the music!",1214956800,7,506,4.07
3322289,4,B0012EM5DI,Ok so the 90210 DVD's aren't perfect. No reason to beat a dead horse on that. The characters and stories are what's important and I've had a blast going down memory lane.

3322290,4,B0012EM5DI,"Towards the end of this season, it was obvious that Brenda had grown distanced from the rest of the gang, and towards the end there everybody was being a jerk to her. They actually believed that Brenda slept with the director of the play just to get the part. And then Steve has the nerve to tell her that he was ""your brother's friend, not yours."" I was like, ""WHAT?"" Well then what the hell did the last 4 years mean to you? Brenda stood up for him in Season 2 when that gold digging bimbo was after him and called herself his friend. I guess it just goes to show that people move on. And then there was Kelly, with her on-again, off-again friendship with Brenda. I was so glad when her and Dylan broke up, she was getting on my last nerve this season. Anyway, the point is, Shannen Doherty was the best part of this show and after she left, it was downhill until the series finale.",1213833600,7,884,4.205882352941177

Steve gets to say in the frat house ""KEG""...David and his drug problems...The Walsh's are married for 20 years...Brenda and Dylan sleep together on the last episode...what a great show.

3322292,2,B0012EM5DI,"I was extremely disappointed in the Season 4 DVDs.  I cannot tolerate all of the scenes that they cut.  The storylines don't even make sense when they cut out those scenes.  I agree that I can tolerate some of the music being different, however in some of the episodes it is a little ridiculous.  For example, in the episode where Brenda flashes back to the 60's, the 60's music is an integral part of the episode.  I think they completely ruined that episode by changing the music.  And in the episode where the KEG house throws a 70's party, they couldn't get the rights to any 70's music????  The music they use just doesn't make sense and doesn't fit with the episodes.  Most disappointing to me was they changed the comedians that did the ""Everything you need to know about Season 4"".  I don't know where they got those two from, but they were not even close to being funny, they were just uncomfortable to watch.  I very much enjoyed the duo from Best Week Ever they have had for past seasons, they were hilarious!  It seems as if every season they cut out more and more things out of the DVDs, I guess to cut costs.  I doubt if I will purchase any more in the future.",1210723200,8,1174,4.334862385321101

I was a big fan of Brenda, but I still enjoyed the show very much after her character did not return. There are plenty of reviews for this season that are detailed, well thought out, and better than mine would be. My real reason for writing this review is because I have a music question about one of the songs used on the DVD:

 I was very moved by one of the songs used in an episode. I've been trying to find the song by doing lyric searches, but I have had no luck so far. The episode the song is on is called ""Somewhere In The World It's Christmas,"" and the song is playing during the scene where the Walsh family is on a plane to Hawaii, but there is trouble and they need to do an emergency landing. It starts out as a traditional Hallelujah, but then the vocalist adds her own lyrics. Like I said, I've been searching for days with now luck. Please help me out if

3322305,3,B0012EM5DI,"Beverly Hills The Fourth Season marks for the last season of the talented Shannen Doherty. That in itself make this series a downer. The transition from high school to college is well done but there are two main problems with this series and I have have noticed series 3. Yes the original music has been changed which is a massive pain as some of the songs that have been included do not match the scene it's referring to. Take episode 4 ""Greek Life"" There is a 70's party and the music that is used is not from the 70's at all. The worst thing though is there are scenes missing. Also from ""Greek Life"" there is a scene where Andrea and the girls attend a candle light ceremony and she is wearing the Jewish Star which causes a problem within the sorority. This scene has been completely left out and it jumps to Leslie from the sorority going to Andrea's dorm to confront her. I was a massive fan of this show and used to tape it each week and watch it a number of times so for me the deleted scene was very obvious.  This is also the case in season 3 ""Prom"" 2 scenes were deleted where Tony Miller was at the table bragging how he got a key for a room for him and Brenda. Brenda overhears this and tells him in your dreams. There is also a scene missing where Dylan goes up to Brenda's table and asks her to dance. For me that was massive at the time as I was a huge fan of Brenda and Dylan's relationship and was so disappointed to see if didn't make the DVD, it just shows them on the dance floor. What is with that. Why are they cutting out scenes????? Apart from that the old memories are there and as it was a great show so I will try and not get to annoyed with the missing scenes...",1210464000,8,1692,4.111782477341389

The RUINED Cindy and Jim's Anniversary by not playing ""What the World needs now"" and cutting scenes. They COMPLETELY MURDERED the episode where Brenda finds the diary from a 60's teen. I'm sorry but the music in that episode was PIVOTAL!!!!!!!!!! PLUS, they cut out all the historical footage...this is complete BULLS**T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't remember the show's original ""TV"" episodes, I know that many are upset because the shows are edited and the music is changed, however, the box sets specifically write that to let the buyer know before hand. It does not bother me that the episodes are cut or that the music is changed because I saw the episodes on tv but I was not an avid follower of the show. I have all seasons and plan on buying the rest because the stories are really good.

The one scene the you could tell they chance the music was when Brandon met the ice skater and they were in the ring skating. The song they replaced it with lost the moment, however all other songs seemed to be ok. I am worried how they'll release the song with the peach pit after dark seeing that they had quite a few music acts. Hopefully they will come out in a timely manner.

Even if you don't like Shannen, she is a good actress and the character of Brenda brought a lot to the show.  Nonetheless, I still liked the show after she left, just not as much.  Season 4 is great.  I am not going to write a long drawn out review of the season because a lot of other reviewers have already done that.  These reviews are supposed to be partly about the DVD itself and I have a huge problem with it, which is the only reason I only gave it 3 stars.  Did anyone else notice that they cut out huge scenes from some of the episodes, namely the episode where they go out for the Greek life.  They completly cut out the end, as well as a section in the middle where Aundrea wore her Star of David to the Candle Light Ceremony.  It took a lot away from the episode.

3322312,4,B0012EM5DI,"Ok, this is it-No more Brenda. To me, the show begins its decline once she leaves. I can't believe how many people hate this character-she was so honest and straight-forward. In the early episodes Dylan was a little bit of a wimp with her and she takes advantage, but COME ON-Kelly was a mega-bitch who stole her boyfriend and then got jealous whenever they were in each others company-it is very apparent in season four. Brenda and Dylan had the best chemistry by far. Being a fellow Class of '93 myself-my friends and I were obessed with the first three seasons-I even used to tape them on VCR tapes back in the day. Now I can own the DVDS!! However, my collection stops with season four-I can't even look at ""Valerie"" and Claire is soooooooooo annonying!! How the show survived six more seasons without Brenda is beyond me!!
