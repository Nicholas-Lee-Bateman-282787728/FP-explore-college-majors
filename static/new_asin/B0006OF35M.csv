8042064,1,B0006OF35M,"There is a wonderful 32-page booklet that accompanies this dvd which is almost enough to recommend it but the quality of the dvd is just not there. The music on the dvd at the introductions is so loud the presenter cannot be heard, this goes on for several minutes in several places. It was with some sadness this dvd was returned due to the very poor quality. It should be mentioned the first two shipments received were the video version of this program, the third version was a dvd with no sound and the fourth version was the one that was returned. There is clearly a serious intent to light a love of learning through science here based on the quality of the booklet. Maybe at some future date the quality of the dvd will be improved. Do not really have an alternative to recommend in the same price range but a dvd with a similar intent that captures the quest of science to better the human condition is ""A Science Odyssey"" hosted by Charles Osgood. ""A Science Odyssey"" is limited to the twentieth century in scope whereas this dvd has the intent of covering the entire history of science. Although not available as of 3/31/2006 in Region 1 (North America) for under $100 ""The Ascent of Man"" series from the 1970's follows this same path tracing the impact of science on culture throughout history.",1143763200,3,1305,4.5574468085106385
