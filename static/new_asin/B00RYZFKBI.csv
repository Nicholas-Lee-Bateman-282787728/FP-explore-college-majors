The films have great cast members like Natalia Nogolich; Jeff Conaway; Erik Estrada; Hunt Block; Ernie Hudson and others. The films were filmed on location in the former Yugoslavia. I swear Kenneth Branagh appeared briefly in the second film. The films came out in 1987 and 1988 for television viewers.

There are no special features.",1528243200,,579,4.958762886597938

8696354,4,B00RYZFKBI,"Here is a short explanation for those of you that are on this page going ""what the hell are these films?"" If your on this page I'm sure you know about the film ""The Dirty Dozen"", that likeable tough-guy WWII film was a box office success back in 1967 but it seems few people today know that it inspired three sequels. Yes the sequels were all roughly made 20 years after and for TV but three sequels did follow. The first sequel ""The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission"" was released in 1985 with Lee Marvin returning. The film must have brought a good crowd to the television screen as two more sequels were soon made: ""Dirty Dozen: The Deadly Mission"" and ""The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission"" both which are featured here in this double feature (""Next Mission"" is available as a bonus in the Special 2 Disc Edition of the first Dirty Dozen).

Lee Marvin opting out of these last two entries (perhaps by his death) was replaced by Telly Savalas, an actor returning from the original Dirty Dozen but not playing the same character due to obvious reasons for people who have seen it. To be honest I wasn't all that hot with the second Dirty Dozen film ""Next Mission"". It was alright entertainment for a TV made film but I doubt I will be watching it much. I however was surprised by how much I liked these other two sequels with Telly Savalas. I'm not sure but Savalas, even in his old age, has a screen presence to him that makes these sequels very enjoyable. The plots aren't all that enthralling or great but Savalas makes these films worth checking out. Savalas in each sequel is surrounded by a cast that many seasoned film enthusiasts will recognize such as Bo Svenson (Walking Tall Parts 2 & 3), Thom Matthews (Return of the Living Dead I & II), Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters 1 & 2), amongst others. I had a great time playing ""spot that actor"".

For TV made sequels these are pretty entertaining. Sure the plots lack but Savalas and the rest of the cast keeps the films trucking along. The production value on these films are also great considering the hindrance of being shown on TV. If your fan of the film The Dirty Dozen then I highly recommend picking up it's now rarely seen TV made sequels. Now only if they would release the short lived 80's Dirty Dozen television series to DVD...

On a side note that has nothing to do with the films, I found it an annoyance that all three sequels have differences in the titles. ""The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission"" has no ""The"" in the subtitle. ""Dirty Dozen: The Deadly Mission"" has no ""The"" before Dirty. ""The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission"" has ""The"" in both places. You think the person in charge of titling would have found some uniformity between them but oh well...it's just a minor thing :-)",1430179200,9,2733,4.494969818913481
