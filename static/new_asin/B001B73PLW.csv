3484336,1,B001B73PLW,"It's difficult for me to review this DVD because it seemed like very little effort went into the making. Bozenka's an amazing dancer and a gifted instructor so why this did not translate into her video doesn't make sense. The DVD would fit the advance beginner level; unfortunately, if you've had more than a year of dance instruction, you might feel cheated by the slim amount of instructional material. I would only recommend this video if you're the kind of dancer who sometimes feels lazy and you'd like to follow along without putting a lot of mental effort. As long as you're very familiar with your shimmies, you could use it for this method. I know some dancers do this at home. Still, I'd go hunting for another video before popping this one into my DVD player. BDSS should be producing better videos.",1232064000,3,810,4.671328671328672
3484337,1,B001B73PLW,"I'm not sure what Bozenka was thinking with this DVD.  There are such excellent shimmy dvd's on the market already, to put together something so lacking.....

I attended one of her workshops a few years ago and it was the same way.  She taught a choreo that she was making up as she was going along.  Which might work with Yousry or Suhalia, but not Bozenka.  And then her performance was 2 minutes of wings!  It was obvious she put no time or effort into preparing for the event.  Very dissipointing!  Bozenka thinks way too much of herself.",1231027200,3,542,4.459183673469388
3484338,4,B001B73PLW,"Have to agree that the title is misleading because they only cover 12 shimmies and it would be utterly amazing if they could teach you ""Every Shimmy in the book"" in a 51 minutes Dvd (which also includes a performance and an interview).  There are really 4 main shimmies, like what the other reviewer have said, with variations that make the 4 main shimmies equal to 12 shimmies that are taught, which are the Shoulder shimmy , Basic shimmy, Shimmy on the toes ,  Shimmy ,  Shimmy side-to-side ,  twist--Hagala , Bedouin shimmy , Egyptian shimmy, Tension shimmy - Freeze, Pelvic shimmy, Twist shimmy , and Steady shimmy.

Here is the breakdown of the DVD:

Warm Up:  I really like her warm up and I think I would incorporate it into my warm ups at home. The issue I would have is that she stretches her hips front and back a lot further then what most beginners can do, and she doesn't give people a warning only to go that far if you are that flexible.

Movements:  She first demos the move for a few seconds, and then breaks it down.  She slows down the moves and then follows it with a quick drill, then moves on to the next shimmy.  She expands each shimmy very cleanly, with tips, and gives you a little history of the shimmy.

Cool Down:  I like the cool down she uses and how she explains how important the cool down is.  Oddly, she just stops talking and it just becomes ""Monkey see, Monkey Do."" With some of the movies she uses, without explanation, you can hurt yourself if you are not careful.

Ends at 35 mins

A Live Improved Drum Solo Performance:  Dances with a live drummer.  I read reviews that they thought she did an over simply drum solo, and I have to disagree because her control is amazing.  It really looks like she just having a good time and just having fun. 3:42 mins

Bonus Menu - Dancer's Cut Performance:  Bozenka's cut of the drum solo. Interview with Bozenka: a 3:14min interview with Bozenka about the shimmies that she is teaching DVD. Interview with Bozenka and Issam : a 1:23 min with Bozenka and Issam following up the Improved Drum Solo Performance and explaining the performance.

I love the overall clean and zen feeling of the whole over look of the video.  She wears a plain black sports bra with knee length green dance pants, and a simple green coin scarf. Nothing is distracting from being able to watch her body to learn the movements.  The setting is a single mirror in front of her with cloth false wall on the right side. The set is very simple Zen like. The dcor on the set has with 3 plants on oriental tables around her.  Even with the setting, there are no distractions, that I've seen like floating electric plugs in the background in other DVDs.

Overall:  A lot of the times, I just caught myself starting at the screen on how clean, sharp, and big her movements are.  She is amazing dancer.  I personally liked the video. It's not a drilling DVD but more of instructional DVD. You are going to have to hit the fast forward button a few times, if you want to practice it with the DVD or just pause it and drill it on your own. I would recommend this DVD to people who at least had a few belly dance classes under their belt and people who are interesting in cleaning up or exploring different views of doing commonly use shimmies. Honesty, people have different styles of learning and this one worked for me.  I'm still consider myself an Advance- Beginner because I have been only belly dancing for over two years.

The DVD retails for $14.99 and the cheapest place to buy the DVD I've seen so far is Amazon.com for $12.99.  You can also rent it on Netflix, if you want to view it before you buy.",1227139200,6,3652,4.388392857142857
3484339,3,B001B73PLW,"I agree with another reviewer that this DVD is very disappointing. Is it another money-making idea for the BDSS? There are only 12 shimmies demonstrated here: 1 shoulder shimmy and 11 hip shimmies including a ""freeze"", haggalla, twist, Egyptian, etc. Bozenka's shimmies are amazing but she does not explain how to develop the technique, she only shows each one for less than a minute, maybe she fears competitors.
Instead of this DVD I would recommend Leila Jouvana's 1001 shimmies which is much more complete and detailed. After all Leila is the ""shimmy queen""!",1217462400,16,562,5.053763440860215
3484340,2,B001B73PLW,"My first impression of this video: disbelief. The producers of Every Shimmy in the Book with Bozenka must surely know that there are a lot of well-known shimmy instruction videos out there. Including one called 21 Shimmies. Why then do they go and create the expectation that this is the last word in shimmies, spanning everything possible? Not only is this video failing to live up to the expectation that this is an absolute encyclopedia of shimmies, but it's going on to reinforce that expectation with a subtitle that goes:  ""A bellydancer's complete guide to hip perfection"". Well, if it's a bellydancer's guide, why is it so basic and brief? If it's a complete guide, where are the rest of the shimmies? If it's about hip perfection, where are all the other hip moves and where are the practice or drill sessions to make you perfect? Well, they're not on this video, unless I'm totally missing something. I do indeed have rather poor eyesight and if there are some subtle menus leading to lots more content on this video, I haven't found them.
I know that Bozenka is a greatly admired dancer and many of my bellydancer friends have been to her workshops and loved her, but that doesn't mean it's okay to put out poorly conceptualized content. If this were the first shimmy video in the world, I'm sure it would have been great. But I've seen more detailed shimmy instruction on general belly dance videos, let alone shimmy-specialized ones. Perhaps a simple and honest ""Shimmy with Bozenka"" would have been better.
But my problem with this video isn't just nit-picking about a title. There are 12 shimmies covered here and 12 is good enough for me. In fact 3 or 4 are enough for me! But not more than 2 minutes is spent on any one of these. For a beginner, that's not anywhere near enough. For an already-dancer, it gives nothing that isn't covered everywhere else. For everyone else in between - knock yourself out if you have the money to spare. There's no detailed breakdown, no practice, no drills. There's a warm up and cool down on the video but why I'm not sure because the instruction isn't really formatted for do-along mode - it's more demo mode. So each shimmy goes through in this format
-Let me demonstrate (30 secs)
-Let's break it down slightly (30 secs)
-Look with the camera close at a slower demo (30 secs)
-Let's try it together up to speed (30 secs)
Over and out. In two New York minutes.
I tired learning the Hagala shimmy here,  but the instruction was so brief I couldn't figure out where you add a twist in the sequence. In the shoulder shimmy section, there are zero tips on how to actually isolate the shoulders properly from the torso. I wouldn't blame a beginner for trying to twist the entire upper body one is still learning the shoulder shimmy, it would be nice to get into posture, neck position, keeping the hands still, keeping it out of the chest, and so on. But there are no posture or safety tips. Assuming this is for intermediate dancers then, where's the detail? Where are the variations?
So. The shimmies covered here are:
Shoulder shimmy
Basic shimmy
Shimmy on the toes
 Shimmy
 Shimmy side-to-side
 twist--Hagala
Bedouin shimmy
Egyptian shimmy
Tension shimmy - Freeze
Pelvic shimmy
Twist shimmy
Steady shimmy
All said and done though, Bozenka shimmies beautifully. As a belly dance friend described it, ""juicily"". But I'm afraid she doesn't really end up telling us the secret of that smoothness. If you're so advanced that you can take one look and figure it out, well, you're lucky. I'm as clueless as I was to begin with.
She performs a drum solo on this videoimprovisation which is rather nice in its simplicity. But incredibly, the same drum solo features in the bonus section! How generous is that! TThere's an interview with Bozenka in which she tells you how excited she is about the whole concept of the DVD. But what concept, I'm not sure. There are no new concepts that I could spot in this video that has come at a time when there are plenty of specialized videos on shimmies. And when many non specialized videos take up some basic shimmies in thorough detail and practice.
 There's also a little interview with Bozenka and Issam. They talk about the importance of improvising.
Bozenka is such a smooth and wonderful dancer that I can't help feeling this whole video is a lost opportunity - not to mention a lot of lost money. On her website it's listed as $30. This is much-loved Bozenka - she should have given you something more Bozenka-specific!
Another BDSS disappointment.",1216339200,39,4540,4.690087829360101
3484341,4,B001B73PLW,"This is definitely a good dvd for intermediate level dancers who are looking to drill shimmies. A beginner may find it too fast paced and difficult to follow.
I liked that it was only about 40 minutes with a warm-up and cool down, and drilling shimmies gets your heart rate up for a good cardio work-out.",1215561600,7,304,4.446428571428571
8282023,5,B001B73PLW,Love it,1416614400,,7,3.0
8282024,4,B001B73PLW,"I loooove the shimmies in the video, absolutely love and would have paid full price for the Bedouin shimmy alone!! So cool. I feel that Bozenka brought in the mystics and scents of Siwa and the desert here. I have never come across such an earthy and organic shimmy before.

but I agree with the other reviewers that the camera angles are terrible and makes the instructions pretty hard to follow. I'm a beginner with decent dance background and I definitely struggle, but after repeating a lot of times I am starting to get it! I just wish it was better filmed, otherwise I love it so much.

 There was one good thing about the way it was shot though: you do get to see her from the back a lot which makes left/right easy to follow, but why they cut off her hips all those times is impossible to understand in a shimmy video. But all in all I love this dancer and hope for more DVDs!!!",1415318400,,886,4.261904761904762
8282025,3,B001B73PLW,"A more thorough and unhurried approach would make this DVD more enjoyable. But I will turn to it to refresh 12 common shimmies if I need to. I really respect Bozenka as an artistic dancer, but great dancers aren't always great teachers.",1403654400,,236,4.642857142857143
8282026,5,B001B73PLW,"I took a dance seminar with Bozenka and she is one of my FAVORITE dancers (love those Tamallyn Dallal arms!)/ instructors (she is so warm and seems to radiate her love of the dance) and so I had high hopes for this DVD and she did not disappoint!  This is one of the best, most-dancer-friendly DVDs I have ever seen.  For ONCE you actually get to see the instructor from the back and the front simultaneously thanks to a mirror.  And the music was good (even if it did get a bit repetitive towards the end).  Beginner and advanced dancers alike will learn something from this DVD, although beginners may need a little more explanation on some of the movements--the 3/4 shimmy especially.  Most of the shimmies I think a beginner could get if they just rewind each section a couple of times.  This is probably the best belly dancing DVD I have ever seen (although that is not saying much)--I think you will get more of a feel for the dance for this than from any of the numerous other DVDs that are out there.  I am a dance instructor and this DVD is my #1 recommendation to any of my students!

Shimmies are one of the hallmarks of belly dance if not THE MOST important move (I once heard that you can tell if a dancer is American because they don't shimmy enough!) and this DVD is great reminder that there are so many different variations to keep your performances fresh.  The title sequence of each shimmy shows it in slow motion which I thought was helpful.

Not only is there a performance at the end of the DVD with everyone favorite drummer Hassan (improvised seamlessly!), the cherry on top is that in the bonus section there is a ""dancer cut"" version of the performance!  Finally!  No annoying camera cuts or close up on things shaking--just a perfect view of all her moves so I can try to copy her!  Yay!

This proves that a workout video can be simple-yet-effective and educational for both beginners and advanced dancers alike.  And you most certainly will sweat!",1346716800,,1975,4.492997198879552
8282027,2,B001B73PLW,"Wow.. I just tried this, and despite the fact that I'm about an intermediate dancer, frankly (for me), it was horrible.  Like, I had to stop it in the middle of the instruction- `cause it was just that bad...

The name is just a name, so I'm not gonna feed the obvious reviewing fires that've been burning over this DVD.  So let's get straight to the meat & bones of the thing- what's actually on-screen:

While there are a bevy of note-worthy moves in this DVD, there are a few MAJOR stumbling blocks in its production which kind of make it unusable (again, imo), unless you're already familiar w/the moves and only utilizing it for a refresher.

The first drawback I noticed was the pretty wretched camerawork.

Firstly, all too often the camera was zoomed in and focused on Bo's gorgeous face, when it should have been covering her hip work.  This became clear because once he zoomed out, she'd already begun demonstrating.  -And this happened repeatedly.  Plus, thanks to this, by the time the camera panned out enough for us to see what she was demonstrating, there was only a second or two left of the demo. :P

Secondly, the angles were ALL wrong.  For example:  Unless Bo was in a closeup, every other bit of footage featured her shoved off to the side of the camera.  And while I understand from an artistic POV that the Rule of Thirds makes for a more interesting visual, this is an INSTRUCTIONAL DVD, not an illustration shot for Vogue. :P  Most of her hip-shots were cut off at the left, and when there were full-body shots, the camera distance and angle were so panned-out that you couldn't actually see what Bozenka was doing...  (Unless you're one of the lucky few w/a beeeg ol' plasma TV.)  Bo's extremely distant, forward-facing reflection sat on the left side of a huuuge empty divide of space, while her posterior side got pressed into the right side of the frame, making it the only usable example for viewers to go from (again, at least for me).  Now granted I do have poor eyesight, but I should not have to stop trying to do the moves to crane into my telly to see the minute, forward-facing visage of my would-be instructor.  (Plus, the video being letter-boxed didn't help matters.  It only made what was already too small even smaller.)

Moreover, when the camera focused on her ""legwork"" to the front, ftmp all you see are her thighs down- which means given the bizarre pace of the DVD, you had no idea what Bo was doing upstairs in the meantime- WITH HER HIPS. :P

There was other camera wrongness, but I've ranted about that enough.  So let's get to the second (and more important) part- the instruction:

While the instruction starts off sounding okay, in each shimmy we go from bizarre movement breakdowns at a super-slow pace to suddenly being told to ""go full speed.""  And this, Bozenka never actually defines.  What's her ""full speed,"" exactly?  Is it moving to 16th counts?  32s?  Or are we just going willy-nilly?  (I'm guessing it's the latter.)  ..And why is there no progression of tempo?  Instead of gradually picking up the pace and coaching w/reminders of form, etc., (like she does- oddly- in the warmup), for -every, single, shimmy,- she goes from movement breakdowns w/holes in the instruction to suddenly ""going full speed."" :P  She never ONCE says ""okay now let's double that speed,"" or ""go half-time,"" ""let's increase the pace,"" or.. anything.  It's just demo of the full-speed move, sketchy move breakdown, a pause while you watch her, and then, ""go full speed.""..WTF..?

And tying into that last point; there are huuuge holes in her instruction.  Not only are you missing seeing vital parts of her movement thanks to cut-off camera angles), and being rushed into movements that never actually get defined properly, but there are whole pockets of movement which she's clearly demonstrating in many pieces that, for some reason, go entirely unmentioned.  For example, beginning at the Choo-Choo shimmy, she begins to do stuff like weight changes and various bits of body, leg & foot movement which somebody entirely forgot to key the viewer into. :P  While she's demonstrating one thing, she's only discussing a fraction of her movements, and viewers have no idea what's going on, if they're even doing the move right, let alone how to fix the discrepancy between what she's saying and what she's in fact doing. :P .So again, unless you're already familiar w/the move, there's no way most folks (even folks who're rather quick on the uptake and with a decent dance background) will actually do the movement correctly. :P  If you only talk about your hips and begin doing knee bends, foot changes, pelvic pushes and other stuff that you don't discuss being part of the move, you're not actually instructing the ENTIRE move.
..I guess you could say it's very ""do as I do, not as I say.""

I don't blame Bozenka for all this (as who knows who produced and/or directed the video) but all this plus the generally rushed feeling of the video (thanks to the shimmies' instructional time being so oddly choppy & brief) just makes you feel like you've only gotten a sampler, instead of a real, full, instructional DVD.
Of course the performance part of the video is gorgeous, and Bozenka is absolutely lovely, but it seems like this would have been much better marketed as a performance DVD w/a ""gloss over"" of various shimmies, instead of being promoted as a full instructional DVD.

Overall, I give this vid 2 out of 5 flutters.
Frankly, I would give it less, but the library of shimmies really -are- worth putting into your movement library.  ..You'll just need to find another, better resource for learning HOW to do each of them. :(",1339632000,,5675,4.720812182741117
8282028,5,B001B73PLW,"The shimmies featured in this DVD are not all of the shimmies ever performed, but are some of the most commonly used. If a beginner, you will definitely be dripping in sweat by the time you finish the workout. If at an intermediate level, maybe the last shimmy will be a challenge. Professionals, no problem; just have fun with it! Fun work out and bomb performance by Bozenka at the end!",1333843200,,388,4.47887323943662
8282029,4,B001B73PLW,"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews for this DVD..the title may be misleading but if you are an advanced, maybe this is too elementary. As an intermediate beginner, I found this DVD to be great. 12 different types of shimmies which Bozenka demonstrates in approx 30m; my secret, I pause the DVD and practice with a belly dance cd for about 10mn per section.am really pleased

After purchasing other Dvds, I realized Bozenka does not take the time to teach only presents the info quik and go, the rest is on your own",1276300800,3,550,4.565656565656566
8282030,4,B001B73PLW,"I am an intermediate bellydancer as well as an intermediate/advanced ballroom dancer.  I like the format and the pleasant way Bozenka instructs the different shimmies, some which are completely new for me. It also helps to review the more common shimmies.  This has something for all levels and I find it a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I am pleased with this DVD.  Even the length makes it easy to do from start to finish leaving one with a feeling of accomplishment after each practice. Excellent buy for the discount price of $8.99 from Amazon.
I will be buying the 21 shimmies at some point as well since it does cover much more.  It is also much more expensive, about $34.00, so that will have to wait a little longer. That is why I started with this one.",1273622400,2,769,4.510791366906475
8282031,4,B001B73PLW,"Ok so reading all these reviews I was prepared for the worst. Cut them some slack on the title. How many titles are not exaggerated? Leyla Jouvana's is 21 shimmies and 1001 variations. There are 21 shimmies but not even close to 100 variations! It's JUST a title! Maybe it should have been Essential shimmies or Bozenka's favorite shimmies or shimmy like/with bozenka
But drop it people! I honestly think the title is fine.
 I enjoyed the dvd, yes the beginner will more than likely get flustered with it, but for the intermediate and advanced dancer it's pleasant
I loved her breakdown of some of the shimmies and didn't care for her breakdown of some others. like with any other teacher. It's this mix and match of different breakdowns that help the beginner get their first shimmy.
I loved the""bedouin shimmy"" that was a nice touch bozenka! It's a shimmy she learned among bedouins in Egypt how cool is that.
I also like her explanation of the egyptian shimmy. I'm a pretty seasoned dancer and I found it helpful!! So even the most advanced of dancers can benefit from her dvd. I really liked how she included the steady shimmy for traveling too.
Her hagalla explanation was very confusing though.
The performance was fabulous! Bozenka is a lovely dancer, she's such a natural.

I took away a star because of the voiceover, Bozenka has a lovely personality. Don't voice it over!!! It makes me feel even more detached. It's already on a dvd.
Miles Copeland please stop voicing over!!! please!! I'm considering e-mailing him to ask him that.
And also the instruction was very short but you can keep rewinding.

This video is by no means essential. If you need longer breakdowns and more technical explanations opt for Leyla Jouvana's video.
This video isn't bad either though, so if you get it with lower expectations, I think you'll find benefit in it. She includes a couple of cool shimmies.
She also has a nice warm up.
And I added a star because of her shimmies. her shimmies are the juiciest in the business in the usa. they are not fifi abdo's  perfect shimmies, but they are close...
so video could have been better but it's not THAT bad",1244764800,2,2145,4.666666666666667
8282032,1,B001B73PLW,"I was not too happy with this DVD. Everything about was too rapid and hurried, even the warm-up.  The shimmy sequences could have been longer and more fluid.  This DVD is by far inferior to the other Bellydance DVD'S.  Shame on you Bozenka ! You did not do your homework when making a DVD !  You should have studied Neon or Joyce to see what a great bellydance DVD contains.",1235433600,3,374,4.3
