In my opinion, this is a wonderful ""must own"" set...that takes you through their second tour in 1982 ""Devil Soldier"" ...all the way up until Munetaka's death (original drummer)...in 2008.  Footage quality does vary, but this is a very cool ""anthology"" of live footage and in my opinion...is totally priceless! Thanks to SAKURA SHOWER...for the
A M A Z I N G deal you gave me on this one!!!  Keep looking and you will find it for $70.00...like I did! :)",1365379200,,868,4.8120805369127515
8276527,2,B001AB0E7C,"These are not the complete concerts. They are edited down to fit on these discs. They could have released them as dual layer discs and included the entire concerts, but they chose to give you just the highlights. Disc 4 is the only must have as it has two unreleased concerts. One from 1982 in Tokyo and one from 1985 in Denver. I recommend getting the full Live Loud Alive '84, Eurobounds '85, Lighting Strikes Live '86, The Soldiers Just Came Back '01, Live Terror '04, Loudness in America '06, Muneguchi Forever '09. Also the 3 disc Classic Loudness Live 2009 is awesome.",1321833600,,574,4.58252427184466
8276528,5,B001AB0E7C,"The famous, frustrating Legend Of Loudness DVD, released in 2008. Here's the source of all of the cornfusion about this DVD: It is a region 2 DVD only -- it will not play in North American DVD players unless yours can play region 2 DVDs for some odd reason; and, as such, this DVD was released only in Japan.

COME ON GUYS -- release a version that we can buy and watch in North America! Not all of us here are fools, you know! Tons of us know about Loudness! With THIS setlist, and THIS band performing at their peak (Disc 1), even if the video and sound quality are not 5-star, overall I would expect that this DVD would enter the hallowed list of Best All-Time Metal DVDs... if we could only get our hands on it. This DVD needs to get on the market for sale here in North America. I'm a Loudness junkie, I would buy this DVD from Amazon ASAP, and I'm not alone!

For an 80s Loudness fan, all indications are that Disc 1 would be the HOLY GRAIL. Here's a track listing:

[CONCERT ONE] Live-Loud-Alive Loudness in Tokyo (1982): 1. ""In the Mirror"", 2. ""Lonely Player"", 3. ""Exploder"", 4. ""Road Racer"", 5. ""Burning Love"".

[CONCERT TWO] Eurobounds (1983): 1. ""Crazy Doctor"", 2. ""Dream Fantasy"", 3. ""In the Mirror"", 4. ""Esper"".

[Music Videos] (1985): 1. ""Crazy Night"", 2. ""Like Hell"", 3. ""Heavy Chains"", 4. ""The Lines Are Down"".

[CONCERT THREE] Live in Tokyo - Lightning Strikes (1986): 1. ""Loudness"", 2. ""Shadows of War"", 3. ""Drum Solo"", 4. ""Let It Go"", 5. ""Guitar Solo"", 6. ""Crazy Night"", 7. ""Speed"".",1293062400,,1501,4.47985347985348
