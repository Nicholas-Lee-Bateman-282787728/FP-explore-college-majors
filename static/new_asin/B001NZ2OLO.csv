8328474,3,B001NZ2OLO,"I really wanted to like AAAAAH!! I'm a very big fan of indie horror, and a strong supporter of the indie movement. But only about 1/2 of the movies on this collection are worth watching, and that makes it a very expensive way to get good horror.

There are 6 shorts; the best are My Skin and The Ninth Entry. They should actually get themselves a separate pay-to-watch billing, because both are pretty good. My Skin is a weird revenge tale; fun, and rather inventive. The Ninth Entry is a new way of looking at outbreak horror, and quite effective. But the others suffer from poor scripting, too much silliness (I prefer my horror with no humor or dark humor), and just not being innovative.

We'll see if Amazon lets this go by, because I'm about to plug a different venue for indie horror--indieflix.com; they have 100s of indie horror films, some schlock, but some absolutely brilliant, rising far above what is available in this collection. You can get an unlimited subscription for 10 bucks a month, or choose individual films and pay as you go. I recommend the subscription, as it's the best deal, unless you're only going to watch one or two.

So, save your money and go for someplace where you can get a better selection, that's my recommendation.",1292198400,,1255,4.6441441441441444
