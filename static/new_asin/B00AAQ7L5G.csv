5406526,1,B00AAQ7L5G,"Pure voyeuristic dreck! I have to look closer, no more David DeCoteau or Rapid heart productions. This ""story"" has 5 ""MMA fighters"" auditioning to be managed by Cynthia Rothrock (ivy) she has cameras set up to watch them workout, spar and even as each young man takes a shower (she watches) Bizarre and twisted of her. Very homo-erotic, handsome and nicely built men breathing heavy and sweating and wrestling. Lots of underwear shots. I thought that Rothrock would be the worst....the character Jimmy is an assault on your senses. The usual DeCoteau location, bad story and really bad acting. Shame on me for thinking it was a real fight movie. Dustin seems to be the hottest of the men, there is a very hairy man too for those who like that. The Jimmy character spent the first 20 minutes opening the door, telling whoever it was they were late and his room is upstairs, growled all the time too.",1431043200,6,898,4.654088050314465

5406528,2,B00AAQ7L5G,Just like all of the 1313 Movies. and what else can be said about all of the 1313 movies. They all look alike and they all suck. Some good eye candy is all the movies have to offer.,1420070400,,181,3.789473684210526
5406529,1,B00AAQ7L5G,"The film open with an 80's Miami Vice style soundtrack. Ivy (Cynthia Rothrock) invites a number of hard body young fighters to spar and train at her home which has cameras all over the place. Her goal is to pick one to manage and make a star fighter. The film consists of her walking around in the same dress looking at the guys while they exercise, spar, and shower...all the while she records stuff into her PDA. That is pretty much it until the twist in the last 10 minutes.

The acting was terrible. Josh Griego was laughably bad. The script went nowhere. The whole film is about showing off abs and packages in shorts. I will be destroying my copy, not good enough to give away.

5406530,2,B00AAQ7L5G,"I have always been a fan of Cynthia's movies. This one, I believe, was her worst. I know a time comes when it is difficult to perform such strenuous body movements. When that time comes, it is time to go on to something else. In this business, it's wise to plan ahead for another goal to achieve.",1368057600,7,296,4.2105263157894735
5406531,1,B00AAQ7L5G,"When I first heard of its release, I was excited at the prospect of watching Cynthia Rothrock's first movie in almost half a decade. So what if the DVD cover looked stupid and it was directed by trashmeister David DeCoteau - it was an action movie starring the Lady Dragon, so I was bound to have a good time. Then I began watching, and before the film was half over, my happy illusion shattered. Good friggin' grief, is this a dreadful movie. This film can be marketed as an action movie the same way that the director's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1313/dp/B005LZW6BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1313</a>&nbsp;series can be marketed as sci-fi movies: sure, the premise deals with an action concept and there's a bit of fighting, but by and large it's just a showcase of near-naked male bodies. I'm talking just a step above softcore pornography, and that's not what I wanted to watch.

The story: a legendary manager of champions (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undefeatable/dp/B0024F08FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undefeatable</a>) invites five young fighters to her villa to select her next big star - a decision she will make by observing them train, spar, and take showers.

Let me reiterate, this is not really an action movie. There are five fight scenes between the male performers, but their choreography is lackluster - lots of bouncing around and fist-tapping - and the camera is forever zooming in and out on the action. The most offense Rothrock gets in is giving some of her costars dirty looks. It's a dark day, if someone is throwing kicks in a movie Cynthia's in and it's not her... Of course, if we substitute fight scenes with scenes of the performers showing off their semi-naked forms, the movie becomes a bit more substantial. I have never seen so many prolonged training scenes, shower scenes, and shots of men walking around in their underwear for no reason in a single film. I think literally half of the runtime is given over to these dialogue-free montages. Could this be appealing to the right audience? - definitely. Would I still have picked this one up, had I known it was this kind of movie? - definitely not.

Given the kind of film this is, any kind of plot is completely facetious, and ""Badass Showdown"" looks rather foolish when trying for the minimum. There are parts in here about the tension between Rothrock and her young prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Josh Griego), a shady deal between the contestants played by Kip Canyon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master-X-Axis-Rising/dp/B009B8YNGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master X: Axis Rising</a>) and Brandon Schinaman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2-Voodoo-Academy/dp/B008LFYYTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2: Voodoo Academy</a>), and a very last-minute insertion about the parentage of Jarrid Balis' character, but all writing for the film feels like a second priority and inconsequential - more so than that of any regular dumb action flick. Production-wise, the movie's still better than a lot of the no-budget junk flooding the market these days, but it still looks pretty cheap. Most of the camerawork is handheld, there are many time-killing environment shots, and the entire picture takes place in a single limited location. The movie tries nothing ambitious, which is probably for the best given its resources and agenda, but it's all the more boring on account of it.

I have no earthly idea what Cynthia Rothrock was doing in this movie. It has to be one of the easiest projects of her career, and also one of the very worst, even without the considerable disappointment factor of this being her first film offering in four or five years. Shame on the producers for marketing this one as an action movie. Even if looking at handsome men in their underwear is your kind of thing, the internet has enabled you to pursue that activity for free - no need to spend $18 on junk like this.",1365120000,16,4068,5.4523809523809526

8549282,1,B00AAQ7L5G,"I know C.R. movies are 'B' movies, but come on! I only watched the opening scene, and frankly her ""badasses"" were just making ""asses"" of themselves. I've been in the Arts (TKD) for over 20 years and those five fighters looked like yellow belts. And THAT'S being nice. Meaning, they look like surfers or gym rats that had no fight training. Maybe two weeks movie prep. I could go on for a while pointing out why I say that; but I'll just say ""NO rotation in their technique"". The chance to be in a C.R. film (or any film) should been able to attract guys who've had at least some training... Guess not.",1484611200,,601,4.327433628318584

8549288,1,B00AAQ7L5G,"Okay, this is NOT a film, it's just 55 minutes of guys showering and working out with 15-minutes of talking to pass off an excuse for a story. Seriously, I timed it.

The DVD cover is to sucker MMA fans into buying it. Thank God for DVD rip-s and sites like put-locker. How this guy continues to produce these things is beyond me.

David DeCoteu used to make decent films, now he just does soft-core gay-porn and puts a 'mainstream feature film' cover on the DVD too sell more copies.

Anyway, the timing...

00-04 mins  5 topless guys punch the air to crap music (director 'credit' but no 'actor' names)
04-09 mins  'Jimmy' telling each 'character' You're late, your room is upstairs one after the other
09-16 mins  Promoter asks Jimmy what the fighters are like  fighters we haven't seen fight and she recruited them  shouldn't she have looked at them first?
16-18 mins  2 guy lifting weights  no talk just crap music

21-23 mins  2 guys in a jacuzzi
23-29 mins guy showering  'promoter' watching it on a monitor
29-30 mins  Jimmy being a pointless a-hole
30-33 mins  Promoter talks about managing their finances  before signing anyone OR seeing them fight  just light sparring 'workouts'

33-34 mins  2 characters make a 'deal'
34-35 mins  2 'characters' talk about  no idea

36-40 mins  'Character' showing to crap music
40-41 mins  Lifting weights to crap music
41-42 mins  Promoter asks 'fighters' what their favourite finishing move is
42-48 mins  Light sparring montage to crap music (half speed strikes  but no one blocks)
48-52 mins  'Character' showering to crap music

55-59 mins  'Character' showering to crap music

64-66 mins  A 'fight' in which no shot are seen (WTF?)

67-70 mins  You're my mother 'twist'
70-71 mins  Winner asks a-hole Jimmy to train him

CREDITS

Not only did the 'writer' of this crap put his name on it  but there's a STORY BY credit. THERE IS NO STORY! WTF?

The 'director' made SKELETONS in the 90's. THAT WAS GOOD. Good script, good camera work, good direction. He just needs a script with a story, good characters an decent dialogue  and to lose him obsession with having 25 minutes of guys walking around shirtless without purpose. Yes, you're gay, we know, stop making a big deal out of it.
