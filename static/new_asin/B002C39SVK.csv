3903108,5,B002C39SVK,it is the best cartoon series ever made on the face of the earth buy it buy it now &szlig;',1356048000,,91,3.6
3903109,5,B002C39SVK,It's a good gundam series. I like it alot better than the gundam wing series. I place it second to the seed destiny series though because the strike freedom fighting to stop war forever without killing ppl but crippling their war efforts is just such a awesome. A very well done series none the less. Absolutely no disappointment here from this series. Oh and the artwork is amazing like the seed destiny series ^^,1350777600,,414,4.608108108108108

3903111,4,B002C39SVK,"Following on from the quite frankly amazing finale of Season 1. This boxset contains Episodes 1 - 7.

Several years have past since the last great battle involving Celestial Being. The world is in a state of false peace with the goverments of the world electing the A-LAWs to the be police of the world.

With the worlds media and information being controlled by Ribbons using Veda. The A-LAWs have free reign of the world and are essentially commiting brutal acts in the name of peace.

Not standing for this Celestial Being awakens. Knowing that their actions have drove the world down this unfortunate path they look to right the wrongs of the past and give the world a better future than this.

Introducing a new character who to me was ridiculus in his introduction and design(Because he looks indentical to a certain guy who died last season, you all know and love him). New Mobile Suits, and new relationships forming, old and new.

This is Celestial Being. They have a mission. They have a purpose and they're looking to right the wrongs in the world once again.

My review title quotes one of the best dub lines in the season with one of the best Gundam activations in the entire series. Said by Setsuna F Seiei no less.",1287273600,,1229,4.589041095890411

3903113,5,B002C39SVK,"The first 7 episodes of the Gundam 00 second season with manga. If you have not seen it, it's great; my opinion is 00 is the best Gundam to come to America sense Wing.
