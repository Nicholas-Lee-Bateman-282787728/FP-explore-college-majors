8693945,5,B00R3O6MXA,"This Russian television series ran for 12, 45min episodes in 2009. Russian with English subtitles.
It is not suitable for children under 21 because it depicts the full spectrum of the human condition, the inspiring beauty of human kindness and divine wisdom, and the horror of human wickedness and the most base emotions and behavior. The scene with the Grand Inquisitor is amazing! This part is much longer in the book, another reason why you should read it This is a great introduction to the novel. The book has so much more to offer! Do not deprive yourselves of something wonderful and watch this, even better,  read The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.",1527033600,,667,4.902654867256637

8693948,5,B00R3O6MXA,"This is the closest adaptation to the book that exists. It's hard to think that anything could top it. I'm watching the series while I'm reading the book, and parts are almost word-for-word. A few important things had to be left out here and there because the book is so long. This isn't a problem, except that (as in most movies) you don't get to see the characters' internal thoughts and, because of the depth and complexity of the themes, that can make the plot a little fuzzy to people who haven't read the book. If you have read the book it's not a problem, and I still think the characters are portrayed vividly. The only place it can cause complications is with Alyosha, because he's a character who thinks so much more than he speaks. In this adaptation, he can come across as stony when he's actually a deeply passionate person, and his motives aren't always clear.

The only real beef I have with this series, though, is the subtitles. I get the feeling that they were done by the only English speaker on the team, and nobody checked them afterwards. There's quite a bit of broken English, though not enough to be a problem most of the time, and I noticed some spelling errors as well. Another thing that was less of an issue for me is that the series has low resolution for 2008 (it's in fullscreen rather than widescreen). But that wasn't a problem at all, as I still watch older series on my widescreen TV like the Harriet Vane/Lord Peter Wimsey BBC trilogy and Cadfael. That's about the resolution these DVDs are going to have, if you're familiar with shows from the eighties and nineties.

The soundtrack has some beautiful tracks, like Alyosha's theme, though there's a limited number of songs composed, and sometimes they re-use a theme when it doesn't quite seem appropriate. Usually it comes across as melodramatic, though, and this isn't a problem for me because--hey, let's face it--it's Dostoevsky.",1492732800,7,1920,4.677514792899408
8693949,5,B00R3O6MXA,"The first DVD sent was defective, but the seller responded quickly and sent a replacement.  This isn't your Hollywood style movie, so don't watch it expecting that - some might find it a bit slow otherwise; but if you like the book, this version is true to the story and characters.  I would recommend reading it first though, especially as some of the translations are oddly worded.",1490313600,6,383,4.701492537313433

8693951,4,B00R3O6MXA,"Fairly accurate portrayal of the novel although, of course, it's impossible to come close to mirroring the depth of a 1000 page masterpiece, even in a 12 part mini-series such as this one. The first thing that struck me, however, was the production quality, which resembled something more comparable to a 1960's-1970's television production than what you might expect from a modern 2008 recording, even if it was produced in Russia (although, I have to admit I haven't really watched any other Russian television besides this). The background music also seems out of place and unnecessarily melodramatic, although, again, it might reference something about Russia and the times of the novel that I am just not aware of.

That being said, the acting is above average and if you are a lover of this novel as I am, and have read it several times, you will likely appreciate this non-Hollywood-ish version which leaves out none of the major themes or plots (I was pleased with the inclusion of the Grand Inquisitor story as well as with Ivan and Alyosha's conversation bookmarking it, not to mention Ivan's ""nightmare"" visit with Satan). The actors and actresses alike provide depth to the characterizations and again are a lot more authentic and true to the novel than the other more well known version.

All the same, if you don't know the novel you will probably not appreciate this nearly as much and will likely find the narrative somewhat slow paced . Otherwise, well worth watching, in my opinion.",1469664000,14,1500,4.9015748031496065
8693952,3,B00R3O6MXA,This is a long soap opera that assumes that the viewer knows something of the story.  The episodes are and evening's viewing.  If you know the story and want to see it portrayed well.  This may be interesting and enjoyable.,1425686400,7,223,4.525
