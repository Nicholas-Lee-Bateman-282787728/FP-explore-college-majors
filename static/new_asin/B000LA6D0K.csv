8160578,5,B000LA6D0K,Has a few inaccuracies but all in all a great movie. Lots of vintage NASCAR racing footage that alone makes it worth watching.,1239235200,,126,4.521739130434782
8160579,4,B000LA6D0K,"This is a quite eclectic set from the early-1970s, with the feature being the 1972 movie that is based on the life of Richard Petty, with the second movie - from 1973  - showcasing wrestling legend Verne Gagne and many of the stars from his AWA.

Both movies have superb character actors in leading roles - Darren McGavin as Lee Petty and Ed Asner as a wrestling promoter who has fallen on some tough times - though Richard Petty portrays himself and Gagne stars as a fictional world champion whose time may have come to relinquish the title to a younger grappler who has the support of the top guns in the industry.

The Petty Story was filmed on location in North Carolina, with stops including Caraway Speedway in Asheboro and the Petty Family home in Randleman. The Wrestler also highlights the home of Gagne/AWA - Minnesota - with an interesting scene taking place where Gagne actually trained those who were seeking a pro career.

This is a neat double play and a great look into the cross-promotion of two sports superstars as celluloid heroes.",1230768000,2,1051,4.664864864864865
