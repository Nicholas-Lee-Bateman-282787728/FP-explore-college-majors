2806462,4,B000OZ2CQG,"I knew just from the description that this movie had it all. Rappers and DJs acting, zombified vampires, a bank heist. Although the synopsis was compelling for me, I'm used to being disappointed. But as you can see from the four stars I was not disappointed. The acting at first seemed a little wooden but either it started to not matter or they got better. I thought it was a pretty solid movie, I wondered how they were going to pull off such an outlandish storyline but they did it with aplomb. This movie is just plain fun. Lots of action, comedy and absurd story done so well. My only complaint would be that it ended perhaps a tad too abruptly, but that would be nitpicking. This movie was thoroughly enjoyable.",1187308800,5,717,4.480916030534351
2806463,3,B000OZ2CQG,The movie actually started off pretty good. Getting you all hyped up for a bank robbery. then out of nowhere the town is taken over by zombies. but its worth a good rental.,1186531200,,172,4.242424242424242

2806485,3,B000OZ2CQG,"This is a fun to watch, good low budget pic, don't expect to see a classic here, but it is plenty of action(once the film gets going)and humor. Its starts with some urban hoods who decide, to go to a small town to rob a bank, thinking it will be an easy heist, but they pick the wrong night, because the town is about to become attacked by some zombie/vampire creatures. They become trapped inside the bank and have to fight their way out. Nice pic to pass the time, this film is good fun trash.",1368921600,2,495,4.166666666666667
2806486,1,B000OZ2CQG,"This is a movie that wants to blend the Gangsta movies or the 90's - 2000's with the Current rise in Zombie movies and ends up with something that does justice to neither.
The normal rule that zombies are an ever-present menace in the background is almost totally ignored for the first half hour and the viewer is forced to sit though what seem to be the clich gang bangers talking trash and planning that big score to get them out of the ghetto.
When the Zombies do arrive they seem to be just tacked on.  And the menace that the living dead normally bring to movies is lost.
A viewer who has seen both Gangsta and Zombie movies might find it interesting to go through this movie and just pick out how any of the scenes have been copied from other movies and just tacked on.
As a whole this movie is just a series of tired clichs, over used plot devices and copied scenes.  It offers nothing new and there are better examples of Gang bangers vs.  monters out there.
Not even worth the rating of a B movie that you watch for laughs.",1352851200,,1032,4.255102040816326
2806487,1,B000OZ2CQG,"<strong>Dead Heist</strong> (Bo Webb, 2007)

Man, people aren't even trying any more. I'm trying to imagine the spec meeting for this movie. ""I got this script about a bank robbery that goes wrong."" ""Nah, that's not good enough any more. What can we do to pump it up?"" ""Add zombies?"" ""Zombies are overdone."" ""How about...zombie vampires?"" ""Yeah!"" Good god. And for the record, I only know they're zombie vampires (or vampiric zombies, if there's a difference) because I read the IMDB synopsis, not because anything in the movie clued me in...

Plot: a bunch of thug-life types are out to rob a bank. But, preferring not to dump where they eat, the big boss man behind the job sends his right-hand man Ackson (<em>Furnace</em>'s D. J. Naylor), who wants to get out of the life but can't until he finishes this last job (no, that's not a clich or anything) with the crew to case a bank in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Which just happens to have a massive weapons store owned by a big black guy (Big Daddy Kane). Bet you didn't see <em>that</em> one coming in the deep south! In any case, while Ackson is casing the joint, his charges get antsy and decide to rob the bank without him. Suffice to say the cops, the crooks, and Ackson all find themselves in the bank at sundown, when the vampire/zombie/whatevers arrive and start killing the townsfolk.

Yep, ""arrive and start killing the townsfolk."" It's not that this is a town inhabited by the undead, or that there's some sort of government chemical spill being covered up, or... you know the drill. The vampire-zombie-whatevers just kinda show up. And start killing the townsfolk. ""But wait,"" I hear you asking, ""is there no explanation given for this?"" I'm sure you already know the answer, but just in case, I will put a big SPOILER ALERT here before saying ""no"". Why? Because, most likely, scriptwriter Anghus Houvouras was stuck for an idea, said ""hey! Monsters!"", and threw in vampire-zombie-whatevers, then never went (or never thought to go) back and come up with some plausible explanation for them being there. Which is synecdochic of the care taken with this entire script. Awful. *",1347321600,,2152,4.733333333333333
2806488,5,B000OZ2CQG,"I thought this movie to be filled with action and some humor. It's always great spicing up the zombie flicks gangsta style! This movie might be a low budget movie, but it is worth the money and time.",1299024000,,199,4.2631578947368425
2806489,5,B000OZ2CQG,"Dead Heist is an oscar-level film released by direct Bo Williams. This movie combines action and comedy in an amazingly directed sequence of events. Who can make a bank heist and zombie survival flick all in one? Bo Williams can. The acting in this film is simply superb. This is Danity Kane's best performance to date. No other rapper can play a black zombie hunter as well as Danity Kane. Supporting roles by E-40 and Michael Braxton make the movie even more oscar-worthy.
The movie features a grammy winning soundtrack by Marcus Warren. The music and sounds get the audience into the mood and do not disappoint. The special effects are simply incredible. The action is well sequenced, and the graphics quality is off the charts. At one point, I could not tell if the zombie was real or not.
The plot is amazing, the acting is superb, and the special effects are well done. This is one of the best thought out flicks any director has made. Who can combine bank heists, zombies, action, comedy all in one? Bo Williams.",1242432000,,1019,4.6353591160221
2806490,3,B000OZ2CQG,"DEAD HEIST is what happens when you cross rap artists with the ravenous undead. And, while this flick doesn't stink up the joint as bad as I thought it would, it's not a very good movie, either. What it is is a barely okay urban horror thriller. If you're stuck at home and you've already vacuumed the underside of the carpet and you've already groomed your privates and, now, there's absolutely nothing to do, then you could do worse than throw this dvd in the player.

The plot involves a Miami gangster's bodyguard named Jackson (DJ Naylor) who wants to get out of the business but is forced to pull off one more heist. In desolate small-town Maysville, Florida, four low-rent thugsters come up with a scheme to rob a bank, but they've got enough sense to first run it thru the local crime lord. The plan is approved but Jackson the bodyguard is added to the mix as an insurance policy, to ensure that the heist doesn't go all hinky. But, of course, things go goofy and the robbers find themselves holed up inside the bank, with hostages. Oh, and one more predicament. Tonight is the new moon. This is the one night of the month when the undead come out to feed, and, tonight, Thug is on the menu.

Nothing new about DEAD HEIST, which was made on a shoestring budget and looks amateurish and campy. As for the fright factor, the film achieves the same level of tension and edginess that's developed when two Amish people debate butter-churning techniques. Meaning, there isn't one scary moment here. And I'm pretty tired of the monsters' origins stemming from yet another government experiment gone all hosed up. This horror flick does have some funny stuff, mostly coming from the characters' dialogue, which, by the way, leans towards the profane and the street. The film fails to establish any character you can really root for. Of the cast, DJ Naylor's character comes closest to being likable. The vampire/zombie creatures actually don't look too shabby, considering the budget constraints, but the zombie attacks play out predictably. Note that the zombie things don't aimlessly shamble around, but move quickly and with purpose toward their targets. That ups the ante, so it's a bonus for the film.

It says something when, excluding DJ Naylor, the best thespians in the film are the rappers. E-40 and old school rap artist Big Daddy Kane are actually pretty decent, respectively playing the smooth, glib gangster Hustle and the eccentric zombie slayer. Bone Crusher also shows up for half a moment. Meanwhile, the actors playing the unconvincing cops and the religious bank manager reek like my nether cheeks after Burrito Night.

DEAD HEIST is rife with thug life cliches, gangsta posturing, and hip hop jargon so bewilderingly arcane that linguistic professors are getting all woody. If you're not remotely into hip hop, then this film's probably not your thing. Otherwise, it ain't so terrible. And if you ended up liking this, then you might also want to try out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gangs-of-the-Dead/dp/B000NA1W4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gangs of the Dead</a>.",1215302400,2,3134,5.056092843326886
2806491,2,B000OZ2CQG,"Cheap, absurd zombie flick. Heck even calling a zombie movie is a joke as the zombies roughly take up maybe twenty, twenty-five minutes of the movie and the rest of the movie has these losers trying to pull a bank heist.

You know when your ""talent"" consists of rappers who've never acted once in their life you have a mess. None of the actors were very good except maybe the girl playing Kate. The other actors were as stiff as lead. Also the fact that this was a black cast for the most part we were treated to numerous offensive uses of the N-Word....LMAO. Oh Brother.

All this made the movie that much worse, the gore was ok but nothing specials. The camera and directing were mediocre at best. The opening graffiti like titles already gave you the smell of a quickly, poorly filmed movie.

Anyways, for what it is as a dumb cheap wannabe zombie flick you'll get a few laughs. Is it to warrant repeated viewers? Never. This is not ""Dawn of the Dead"", nor ""NIght Of the Living Dead"".

Sorry to say if you are expecting a zombie flick of that caliber you'll be disappointed. If you don't take my word, look up the bios of the ""actors"" most of them never went on to star in anything else.",1210032000,,1190,4.346846846846847
2806492,3,B000OZ2CQG,"Hollywood needs to come up with more realistic looking vampires/living dead people.  It's okay that a virus works so quickly that people get infected within seconds.  But, these ""zombies"" look so stupid. Maybe the producers should use computer generated vampire/zombies.",1201564800,,270,5.725
2806493,3,B000OZ2CQG,"Surprisingly, this one wasn't really all that bad!

1) ACTING: For the most part, everyone was pretty good. Some of the minor characters had some problems, but I'm thinking that's why they were in minor roles and not major ones.

2) PRODUCTION VALUES: Again, it was pretty good. There were a few moments where lighting could have been better during some of the darker scenes, but overall, a good effort. The soundtrack had a few hip-hop songs, but mostly, it consisted of music that fit the scenes. People walking through an abandoned(?) building...cue the creepy, suspenseful music. Lots of blood & gore, othing over the top, but when someone got shot or hurt or stabbed, there was a good amount of blood.

3) THE CAUSE: A government experiment gone awry.

4) ZOMBIES: I would liken these more to the ""infected"" of movies like 28 days / weeks later. It wasn't just that factor either, that made them different. a) they only came out at night; b) they could be killed, but only by shooting / stabbing/ destroying / etc. the heart (no head shots here!) and c) they only came out once a month during a new full moon. So, take a zombie, throw in a little vampire, some werewolf, a bit of 'Creepers Jeepers"" and some infected and the result was the ""zombies"" in this movie. Like the infected from 28 days / weeks later, these guys travelled fast and furious. That would put them in the same category as ""Snyder runners.""

5) NUDITY: None.

My main complaint, I suppose, is the same one I had with 'Gangs of the Dead' AKA 'Last Rites.' Other than the police officer that gets trapped in the bank with the bad guys, I really didn't care if these guys lived or died. They were everyday common street hoods. They were out to rob a bank and got caught up in the nightmare that was. I probably would have enjoyed this more, if this was just a regular neighborhood (or 'hood) where the majority of the characters were worth rooting for.
