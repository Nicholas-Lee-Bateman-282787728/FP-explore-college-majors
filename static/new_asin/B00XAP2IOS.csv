8715589,5,B00XAP2IOS,Love the DVD but short and so so film quality.,1490313600,,46,3.7
8715590,5,B00XAP2IOS,"This is a great routine.  I like workouts that make me sweat, and this one does without feeling strain.  Because it is done in ""chapters"", you can extend the workout by replaying chapters.  The movements are fun and very satisfying.",1484438400,,232,4.75
8715591,5,B00XAP2IOS,"I have been doing both of Natalie Spadaccino's workouts for about a year and have never tired of them. They are so beautiful and I get a good. solid workout despite the low impact and graceful flow, which one might consider ""too soft"" to get the heart rate going. I love how she combines moves and her originality. I am a big Ellen Barrett fan but Natalie is not a repeat of Ellen's style.",1473465600,,389,4.27027027027027
8715592,5,B00XAP2IOS,I absolutely love this DVD! In thirty short minutes I get a complete cardio workout and have fun too. I have Natalie's other DVD and I use them both frequently. I can't wait for her to come out with another one!!,1464912000,,212,4.195121951219512
8715593,5,B00XAP2IOS,"When I first purchased this dvd I thought it would a spin on Ellen Barrett's exercise style, which I love, but it's not.  Don't get me wrong, it is fusion fitness but Natalie has a style all her own.  The workout is unique with new moves, great music, and it is challenging.  It really got my heart rate up and the time flew by.  I purchased the cardio video as well and love them both.  I hope she will make more videos because I look forward to buying them.",1454889600,2,459,4.112359550561798
8715594,5,B00XAP2IOS,"I am no slouch in the fitness department: I lift weights, do yoga and bellydance, do interval training and advanced bodyweight exercises. I know a walk in the park when I see it. This routine, however, is a fast-paced, non-stop, go-for-broke body blast! There is no time to pause and wonder whether you should have chosen a different wallpaper. There is no time for daydreaming or admiring yourself in the mirror. This is an all-out cardio program made especially effective by the addition of weights. It is not weight training per se (2-lb or even 1-lb weights are called for by the instructor), but any resistance helps, and you would not want heavier weights considering the speed of the moves and the stress on the joints that would result otherwise.

The music is excellent, the cueing is great, and the calorie burn is fabulous. If you like Ellen Barrett's style, prepare to see it taken up a notch!",1446768000,4,905,4.727848101265823
8715595,5,B00XAP2IOS,"I love having low impact, barefoot workouts for lighter days, rest days, or like now having an injured ankle.  I have a bunch of Ellen Barrett's barefoot workouts and Jessica Smith - but have done them so much was really excited to find a new instructor.  I LOVE these Joyful Movement workouts I have both the Sculpt and Cardio.  Nice music, enjoyable workout, no dread factor.  If you are just starting out, or need a low impact workout that's easy on the joints - definitely check these out.",1433980800,7,493,4.568181818181818
8715596,5,B00XAP2IOS,Got both of Natalie's videos and they are both great but I especially love Sculpt.  It's a great total body workout that got my heart rate up and I felt energized after it was done.  This will absolutely be a regular in my rotation.,1433548800,4,232,4.25
