2394686,5,B000AV2GJM,"The audio is fine. It's the same quality of what we saw live on OLN. Sure it's spotty at times, but it's not as bad a some of the reviews make it sound like.",1137974400,2,157,3.6470588235294117
2394687,2,B000AV2GJM,"I cannot over emphasize how frustrating it is to attempt to hear the fine commentary while it is being almost totally obliterated by noise from helicoptors, bells, whistles, horns and other crowd noise.  How could this product be released with such inept audio mixing?  Didn't anyone listen to it before it  was released?  I often must turn off the audio as all I can hear is noise.  Anyone who owns this DVD should be given a new one that is mixed correctly.",1136592000,4,459,4.548780487804878
2394688,2,B000AV2GJM,"I have pretty much every tour since the late 80's on dvd or vhs. After last year's dramatic race, I decided to spring for the 12 hour coverage, and I'm still kicking myself for not getting the cheaper disc.

As others have said, the sound is awful. The commentary is buried deep in the corner of one speaker and often overwhelmed by background noise. WCP normally does a decent job with their videos, but this is so bad that it's difficult to watch it.",1134345600,3,452,4.380952380952381
2394689,3,B000AV2GJM,"If you're a cycling fanatic, you're going to buy this set anyway, but the other reviewers are correct: there are definate issues with the DVD authoring and sound mixing used for this set. The video itself is the same you would have seen on OLN or virtually anywhere else. The video is clear, except when transmission is blocked due to mountainous terrain. That's the video issue mentioned by another issue. It's not that the DVD transfer is bad or anything - it's the same as what you saw on OLN - brief interruptions and assorted glitches.

The audio is another issue. The sound mixing is bad. I found that if I kept the volume at a medium level, it wasn't bad, but the background noise is often too loud to hear the commentary very well - you hear a lot of helicopter noise, crowd noise, etc. They may have been thinking it added to the realism, but they they are wrong - it's annoying. However, it's tolerable.

On one of the discs, the bonus features menu was screwed up. The menu said it was one thing, but it was actually a repeat of a bonus item off the previous disc. That's just bad QA.

Obviously they had to pick and choose which bits of the race to show, and I think in general they did a good job of it. The race always seems exciting, and you get to see most of the major tactical moves.

The bonus features are nice, generally two extra video segments per disc, and are the sort of ""behind the scenes"" stories you might have seen when the race was broadcast, but it's not OLN's videos, which might be a good thing if you already saw that on OLN's coverage when the race was actually happening.",1130457600,15,1608,4.332225913621262
2394690,1,B000AV2GJM,"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS VIDEO.  The quality of this video is that of a high school student.  I pre-ordered this video and AM NOW SEEKING A FULL REFUND.  The audio is HORRIBLE.  The sound mixing is HORRIBLE.  The sound quality is as though someone is speaking in a drum, and the next second the helicopter sounds are so loud you have to mute your sound system; and, then the commentary is so low in volume all you hear is static.  It is a shame that World Cycling Productions put this on the market.  DO NOT BUY IT.  I really do not know how to get this thru to you, JUST DON'T BUY IT.",1130371200,12,599,4.05982905982906
2394691,5,B000AV2GJM,"I own all of the 12-hour DVDs of the TdF from 2001-2004, and while the content is just as amazing as you'd think it would be, the sound quality of five of the six disks is TERRIBLE.  Whoever mixed the sound should lose his job!  The sound of motorcycles, helicopters and insane cycling fans (oh my goodness, those Basques!)drown out a lot of the commentary by the legendary Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen.  Sometimes the background noise is loud, sometimes it's not.  You'll have to mess around with the audio controls of your system to get to hear much of disks 2 and 3.  And the stages are labelled incorrectly on Disk 5, which is such an amateur mistake!  I still HIGHLY recommend this DVD, though; the story of Lance Armstrong's history-making 7th Tour is just as riveting and exciting as it was when I watched it live.  The extra features are fantastic, especially the ones on Thor Hushovd's Mom and the LA pictorial retrospective on Disk 6.",1129680000,6,945,4.589285714285714
8079915,5,B000AV2GJM,Just a wonderful descriptive and detailed account of the 2005 tour. If your interested in a historical account the set of dvds this belongs to are sublime. Great commentary from the legends Liggett and Sherwen.,1504656000,,210,5.0285714285714285
8079916,3,B000AV2GJM,"I was interested in watching this video while riding my indoor trainer. It served the purpose of motivating me. The intro and music is a bit amateurish, but otherwise its a nice summary of the high points of Armstrong's stage and, now defunct, TDF wins.",1456790400,,253,4.644444444444445
8079917,5,B000AV2GJM,I bought this for my grandmother she loves lance Armstrong..im glad she's not around anymore after all the controversy over drug enhancement drugs,1358985600,,146,5.391304347826087
8079918,5,B000AV2GJM,"I have all of the Lance TdF disks. The best ones are the extemded 10-12 hour collections. But if you don't have the time and just want to see the highlights, this 4 hour edition is perfect. The announcers are perfection. Best in the business.",1198281600,2,242,4.4
8079919,5,B000AV2GJM,"I really enjoyed this 12 hr Dvd. It concentrates on the areas of the race that are key to winning. Mostly the mountain stages. Great interviews and behind the scenes clips. I would recommend it to any Tour fan or Lance fan. P.S. obviously, the main focus is Lance and Discovery Channel team.",1189296000,,291,4.509433962264151
8079920,5,B000AV2GJM,"The Tour will never be the same without Lance Armstrong. So this is a wonderful way to remember what his last tour was like. I am a spinning instructor and Lance Armstrong is a great inspiration for me.

8079921,5,B000AV2GJM,"Regardless of the audio or video, this is history.  And for that reason alone it is worth buying this.  I myself am really only a casual fan of cycling, but being able to watch The Tour is a wonderful pleasure; even if it is only the 12 hour version.  Buy this; watch this; revel in Lance's utter dominance in this last Tour he rode in.",1183852800,,336,4.138461538461539
8079922,4,B000AV2GJM,"I bought this collection for my husband, an avid Lance Armstrong/Tour de France fan. He has really enjoyed it, so I feel it was a great success. But I have to admit that I thought it would include footage and commentary from all seven of Lance's Tour de France victories, plus details about his life and his fight with cancer. It only detailed his seventh victory, the 2005 Tour. Nevertheless, I am glad I purchsed it; although for the money, it would have been nice for it to include a bit more. Thank you!",1168819200,2,507,4.404255319148936
8079923,4,B000AV2GJM,"Very nice dvd for those who wish to relive the great moments of the 2005 Tour.  Many who may have watched on OLN will recognize the footage, b/c it's basically the exact footage from the OLN broadcasts.  Not a bad thing in that, since Phil Ligget and Paul Sherwin do a great job commenting.

A couple of notes:

- I was a bit disappointed in the ""Extras."" There are 2 Bonus Features on each DVD but 1 is always just a menu to buy other Cycling/TdF merchandise.

- Good coverage of other riders and action that didn't involve Lance.

- On the other hand, there were some instances where more coverage of Lance/Discovery Team (or even leading contenders and their teams) would've been appropriate. I seem to recall long segments focusing on breakaway riders of little consequence, which was interesting to a point but somewhat boring.  Where was the peleton?  What were the top contenders and their teams doing?

- Why not shorten that coverage and show the Team Time Trial of CSC, T-Mobile, and Discovery in its entirety??  There was barely any footage of what was a spectacularly exciting race. Also, for the last stage, we mostly get a few laps in Paris. I would've liked to have seen the Discovery Team riding en route in their ""victory"" line-up, Lance riding thru the throng of team cars thanking the other sporting directors, etc.

- Yes, the sound quality isn't good. The volume on my set fluctuated from loud to normal (yet sounding like the announcers were in a tunnel).

Still, a very good dvd to have if you're a Lance, Discovery, or overall cycling fan.",1152316800,4,1563,4.6231884057971016
8079924,5,B000AV2GJM,"Reading the other comments, I agree they didn't do the best on the sound but in a way the background noise adds atmosphere to the whole event. Its still an awesome event, you get to see a lot more of the countryside nd amazing places they travel through than on the four hour, more uninterupted coverage of crucial stages especially the amazingly scenic mountain stages. its a riveting watch, probably the most action packed of Lances tours. Vinokourov has to be seen to be belived, that boy just doesnt give up attacking. This is a must for any fan of endurance sport. I don't cycle but that doesnt stop its appeal. It transcends beyond just being about cycling, like all endurance sport its about striving and suffering and overcoming",1152057600,2,736,4.713178294573644
