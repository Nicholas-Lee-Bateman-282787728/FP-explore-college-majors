5322703,4,B009ES41TK,"The latest in my continuing ""Early '80s Hardcore Nostalgia Trip"" series I've been on lately.

It's funny- when I first got into hardcore 30 years ago, the Circle Jerks were one of the first bands I glommed onto and claimed as my own. But now I realize that I barely knew anything about them for all these years. I knew Keith was ex-Black Flag, I knew Greg was ex-Red Cross, I knew Lucky was Chett Lehrer's older brother ... and that was about it. Never knew how they met, how they started the band, why Lucky was only on the first two albums, where his replacement came from, why Roger disappeared, what drove them to make a hard left turn when they did the Wonderful album, and pretty much anything after that because it was around then that I hopped off their bandwagon. Well, all the answers to all the questions I never thought to ask are all contained here, and I loved hearing it all. It's a pretty dry documentary, mainly driven by Keith Morris and Greg Hetson sitting in front of a camera (separately) and spilling their guts. Lucky, Zander Schloss and Earl Liberty have plenty to say as well. Not a whole lot of drama, though I was sorry to hear about how Roger left the band and what became of him years later, right when he was on the verge of rejoining. The whole story just kinda peters out in the end. Not exactly the most compelling documentary in general, but good stuff for an old fan such as myself.

I also want to credit this for prodding me to finally check out Keith Morris' current band, Off. They're the real deal for sure, I never dreamed I'd hear new hardcore in this day and age that actually sounds authentic.",1355702400,26,1637,4.381578947368421

5322706,4,B009ES41TK,"This was very cool. It was interesting to see how they came together and how they evolved through different members. If your a Jerks fan. you'll want to add this to you collection.

5322707,5,B009ES41TK,great documentary.  This ties the knots on a lot of questions you may have.  Excellent old footage as well.  Lucky Lehrer > than any drummer out there IMO.,1411603200,,155,4.464285714285714
5322708,5,B009ES41TK,"This documentary is everything I could've hoped for. Though I've loved the Circle Jerks since my introduction to them around 1989, I didn't know a lot of details about them. I knew the broad strokes, seen the lineup change from release to release, but the details were never very clear to me in that pre-Internet era. Thankfully, this doc came along and tells the whole story in a plain and simply - told way via interviews with the parties who lived it. Though not every last member is interviewed (no input from Chuck Biscuits for example), it feels like the full story is there; you're not left wanting for information.

The outtakes are great and informative as well. For Circle Jerks fans, I seriously cannot recommend this enough. Well done.",1404691200,,747,4.746153846153846
5322709,3,B009ES41TK,The live footage from the early shows is really fun.  Some of the interviews get a bit pretentious.  Some of these people really think highly of themselves and their influence on the world.  I wish they would just tell the story of the band and leave out all the high and mighty political commentary.  But still it's a pretty good movie and an interesting story.,1400457600,,362,4.523076923076923
5322710,5,B009ES41TK,This is an informative DVD that shows the viewer an inside look at one of the most influential early punk bands. If you haven't heard of these guys.... educate yourself.,1372982400,4,169,4.666666666666667
5322711,5,B009ES41TK,"This is a really great doc. It is important for younger people to understand where the music they have comes from. Without the Jerks, there would have been no Hardcore. If there was no hardcore, there would have been no metal, hip-hop\rap, grunge, emo, indie rock or current pop music. Watch this DVD, then show everyone you know.",1372291200,,330,4.706896551724138
5322712,4,B009ES41TK,"I Loved this band since I heard Golden Shower of Hits and saw Decline of Western Civilization!
I was in upstate NY, and their records were not always easy to score! But prizes to Find!
I wanted to know more about the workings of the band, and the time of the LA Hardcore Scene in its ""Golden"" era!
I knew Keith Morris in Richmond Va, when he lived there, and considered him an actual pal. We reconnected when I was living in Hollywood too!
The history and stories are there, and are entertaining, but the confusion gets ""clear"" about what went on with Roger Rogerson, and I was left Not feeling I knew what actually went on, with him, or even his demise. points of views, even varying points of view would have been better or fine. There were also statements made, then contradicted visually or something ten minutes later!
(The same thing happens in Searching For Sugarman)!
Great Band!
Great guys!
Pretty great Film!",1362787200,5,918,4.569696969696969
5322713,5,B009ES41TK,"This video will give you insight into the entire lifespan of one of my favorite bands of all time, the Circle Jerks.  From Keith Morris' end with Black Flag to the formation of OFF! and it's effect on the future of the Jerks, this will take you through all the ups and downs of the band.

Interviews include most of the members of the band including Keith Morris, Greg Hetson, Lucky Lehrer, Earl Liberty and Zander Schloss, to name a few.  There is great concert footage of the band throughout and facts exposed that will answer questions that have lingered for years, not only about the Jerks themselves but aspects of punk that are little known.

Did you know that Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers was once a Jerk?  That one time drummer Chuck Biscuits was ceremoniously kicked out of the band (literally) for refusing to play a gig at a party?  These are the kinds of things you'll discover in the video.

If the Circle Jerks are a favorite or if you just interested in a part of punk rock history, buy this!  Buy it now!  Oh, and don't forget to watch the deleted scenes after you watch the main video.  It's just as interesting as the rest of it and easily adds to all of the other parts.",1361404800,8,1192,4.352941176470588
5322714,5,B009ES41TK,Extended and very candid interviews with the band members and lots of great performance footage from all eras of the band's career.

The Circle Jerks 30+ year career gets the documentary treatment from director Dave Markey (most well known for 1991: The Year Punk Broke). Archival footage, band member interviews and musician testimonials are used to tell the story of the band who released one of hardcore punks greatest albums (Group Sex), but never really knew what to do next. Even though they never had a long term plan for growth and change, it never stopped them from trying to figure out a career for themselves over the next thirty years. While the footage from their early years shows The Circle Jerks at their jaw-droppingly primal best, for me the most enjoyable part of the movie is when the focus switches to those lean years in the late-80s and early-90s when the band put out awful albums while aimlessly cycling through band members, musical styles, and personal issues. Perhaps there isn't anything all that special in the Circle Jerks story to warrant the 96-minute runtime its been given, but the experiences of bands in the pre-Nirvana American Underground are always entertaining enough that youll allow yourself to overlook some of the films weaker spots. Speaking of entertaining, there are few people as entertaining to listen to as Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris, who is at his nervous/intense self-reflective best in his interviews here. How he hasn't been tapped for some kind of TV/film/radio work is a mystery to me. Even if its not perfect, if you love the old days of harcore punk, then checking out My Career As A Jerk is a no-brainer.",1450137600,,1606,5.01498127340824
