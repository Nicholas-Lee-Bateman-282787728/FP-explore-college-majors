6576987,5,B00MFVHOVK,"WARNING: Series Eight in Britain (this box) is not the same as ""Season Eight"" in North America.
There is a one season discrepancy in the numbering of the 'Lewis"" series.
Everything in this box was was released in America last year as ""Season Seven"".

The real U.S. Season Eight =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Lewis-Season-8-Blu-ray/dp/B01DGNBHS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Lewis: Season 8 [Blu-ray</a>]

The confusion is due to PBS's decision to broadcast the first three British seasons as two US seasons.
 Series 8 (UK) = Season 7 (US)
 Series 9 (UK) = Season 8 (US)
There is no difference in content (at least on Blu-Ray/DVD - The PBS broadcasts are a different matter)

ALSO UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIAL REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY THE UK DISCS.
They are encoded for PAL Region 2 (Europe). North America is NTSC Region 1.
-----------------------------

SERIES OVERVIEW:
For the past thirty years, Oxford University has averaged a murder a week.
Shocking.
Actor Kevin Whately (born 1951) has played the same character - Sergeant, then Inspector Robert Lewis - from age 36 through age 64 and counting.

-- a) Inspector Morse, aired 1987-2000 (his Sergeant = D.S. Robert Lewis)
following Morse's death, Sergeant Lewis was promoted to Inspector.

-- b) Inspector Lewis, aired 2006-present (his Sergeant = D.S. James Hathaway)
following Lewis's retirement, Sergeant Hathaway was promoted to Inspector.

-- c) Inspector Hathaway doesn't have his own series [yet] because Inspector Lewis, bored with retirement, came back part-time in Season Seven.
A slightly resentful Inspector Hathaway now shares the 'Inspector Lewis' series with Inspector Lewis.
Together they share Sergeant Lizzie Maddox.

I wouldn't object to Season One of ""Inspector Hathaway"", but I do hope Kevin Whately sticks it out for two more years to celebrate his Thirtieth Anniversary as Lewis.

BUYING OPTIONS:
[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

When Inspector Lewis was first broadcast on PBS 'Masterpiece Mystery', the episodes were cut by ten to fifteen minutes.
The earliest DVD releases were of the cut version, but since then all seven series have been released in America in their uncut form
Seasons 4-7 are also available on Blu-Ray.
Seasons 1-3 are only on DVD.

The official North American ""Complete Inspector Lewis"" box (DVD only) was released in October 2016 (see next paragraph)
Recommended -
- All 33 episodes  are included and are uncut (92-96 minutes per episode, not 80 minute PBS broadcasts)
- The original extra features are included.
- Widescreen picture.
- English SDH subtitles.
- Inexpensive: 18 DVDs for $67

WARNING:
Amazon has screwed up the listing of the Complete Series box, confusing it with the Season 1-4 box (which was a disaster - edited episodes, no subtitles)
The top posted reviews on Amazon are for the Season 1-4 box.
The reviewer complaints are no longer valid.
The first posted review of the ""Complete Series"" box was my review titled ""REVIEW OF COMPLETE SERIES IN 18 DVD BOX"" (dated October 15, 2016)
It is posted to the right of the top three reviews.
[only the first two sentences are posted, click ""Read more"" to read the full review]
I hope it explains the mess Amazon has made of this.
Here it is:

The second easiest way to make certain you are getting the uncut UK version of the early seasons is to buy the Season 1-6 Box (17 DVDs), which takes you to the end of Season Six:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Inspector-Lewis-Pilot-Through-Series-6-2013/dp/B00DUX28XQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Inspector Lewis - Pilot Through Series 6 (2013)</a>
All episodes are uncut, wide-screen and have subtitles + there is a ""making of"" documentary.

-- Then buy Season 7:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Inspector-Lewis-7-Blu-ray/dp/B00MK1RA4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Inspector Lewis 7 [Blu-ray</a>] (Blu-Ray or DVD)

-- I also bought Blu-Rays of Seasons 4, 5 and 6  [I got a deal on ebay so it wasn't too painful despite the duplication with the big DVD box.]
----------------------------------------------------------

Kevin Whately doesn't look 64 in the Inspector Lewis series, but check out his guest appearance as Inspector Don McGhee in the final episode (""Gently in the Cathedral"") of George Gently, Series Five:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Gently-Series-5-Blu-ray/dp/B009EAFL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Gently, Series 5 [Blu-ray</a>]

Inspector Morse - played by John Thaw - was the first and best of modern British Police Inspectors.
He is long overdue for remastering and repackaging at a reduced price.
The 25th Anniversary set was a disappointment: Elderly video transfers, No subtitles, Expensive.

(read the review by Happy Reader dated November 11, 2012)
I only hope the upcoming Thirtieth Anniversary may bring an improvement.

And don't forget 'Endeavour', aired 2011-present.
This is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series.
Set in 1960s England, when young Detective Constable Endeavour Morse is assigned to Inspector Fred Thursday
(Morse dropped the first name after he made Inspector).
