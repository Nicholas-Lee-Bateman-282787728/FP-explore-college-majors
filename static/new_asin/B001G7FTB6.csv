This show will let you see the soul of an artist and the direction on why you should go after anything you might want and have fun doing it! Seen this show at the KISS expo in Dayton and the show just uplifted the fans and kids alike! The director was there to show why Paul Stanley was more then a Kiss singer, the songs Paul wrote and sang on this DVD are some that haven't been heard in years! Very fresh and the band was excellent with Paul! Thanks Lou!",1223769600,,550,4.009090909090909

It doesn't matter if he's solo or with the band, he can/will carry his own weight! The true artist doesn't fit the mold, he breaks it! And I can say without a doubt Paul has shattered that mold! Always giving 110% in everything he does, blood, sweat and almost life itself. The spot light doesn't stay still,it still encompasses Paul where he goes whether he's in KISS or just soloing!
 Out of one shadow, and into the light the crowd awaits his arrival!",1222560000,2,594,4.256637168141593

I not only was lucky enough to attend this show, but I was granted entry to the pre-show soundcheck, met the Starchild and got his autograph! Having been a huge KISS fan for over 30 yrs, it was a highlight of my life that I will NEVER forget.  Paul did it all at this show...KISS classics, new rockin tunes from his latest ""Live To Win"" CD, and early never before performed live material from his first solo album!  I have been going crazy waiting for this release for almost 2 years!  I can't believe the time is so near.  I know myself and millions of diehard Starchild fans will not be disappointed!

Paul put on such an awesome show. I have been bugging Louis Antonelli for two years now about this coming out, and several times he has told me to be patient, it will be worth it.

Now I can't wait to relive this show again some two years later. Regardless if you're a big kiss fan or not you can really get into this one, and with the CBS ""Rock Star Band"" backing him only makes it that much more perfect.

What more can I say, just simply, it will be awesome.",1222387200,8,634,3.9069767441860463

Paul has a charisma absent in todays rock world he knows how to take a no prisoners attitude ...yet care enough to reach out to that person way in the back to make sure all walk away saying it was all it could be...This film allows a glimpse into the very soul of Paul Stanley...producer Louis Antonelli has outdone himself with this one....The world should prepare for future attacks from the STARCHILD  .....

Finally the great ""Live To Win"" tour is documented live.
As someone who has followed Paul since the 70's both his solo stuff and with his band(you may have heard of them...KISS), I can tell you that this man always delivers Live. Paul has always been one of the greatest fontmen in rock, and this dvd will show it once again.
Having the chance to see Paul live on his 89' solo tour and with Kiss, I look forward to buying this dvd. The director Louis Antonelli has been showing sneak peaks at Kiss expos all around the country and the KISS Army is waiting to get their hands on this dvd.
Here is what is on it.

3597336,5,B001G7FTB6,"*edited today (10/15/08) as I've now seen the film in its entirety*

I've been trying to find the right way to verbalize my feelings about this film since returning from the Dayton KISS Expo where we were given the honor of viewing this DVD first.  As I told Lou Antonelli afterwards - I have no words.

The film production was immaculate from the opening frame to the end credits.  Lou really captured the feelings of every single Paul Stanley fan out there.  After watching it, I was left speechless - just filled with so much emotion I had no real way to express how I was feeling.  When the film was over, I turned to my friend Missy who was sitting next to me and said, ""I didn't think I could love him more than I did before, but I do.""  It was that special and touched me that much.

I thank Louis Antonelli from the bottom of my heart for bringing us this wonderful film about someone who means so much to me, and to so many others.

And, of course, thank you, Paul.  You really are special.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I have been waiting patiently for the much anticipated release of this DVD since I learned it was being filmed.  Having had the wonderful experience of attending opening night of the tour and the opportunity to see previews of this film on two separate occasions at KISS related events, I can honestly say this DVD will not disappoint.  Director Lou Antonelli's vision brings us the true Paul Stanley - magnificent showman, talented songwriter and musician.  Whether or not you are a KISS fan, this film is definitely worth the money.  Don't pass it up!!",1222300800,6,1621,4.654929577464789
3597337,5,B001G7FTB6,"this is such a great event, seeing Paul Stanley on his own without having to look at ungly ass Gene Simmons and hear his pathetic voice! Paul is and always will be kiss, I only ever like 3 songs that gene sang.....parasite, world without heroes, unholy.....Paul is the talent and it shows here great DVD good to see him stripped down without all the 'fluff' his made to be a rock star.....his voice yes has deteriorated through the years but thats inevitable he still can hold some notes.",1465171200,,488,4.556818181818182
3597338,5,B001G7FTB6,"When I first heard about Paul Stanleys solo album Live to Win and its subsequent tour, I initially wrote it off as another quick Kiss related cash grab; I wasn't impressed with Pauls previous solo efforts, and I was certainly not convinced his live shows can match the excitement and intensity of a Kiss show.

How wrong I was.

The live release One Live Kiss captures the Starchild on a hot night with an excellent backing band, delivering a powerful set combining solo material and several Kiss classics (plus some choice deep cuts from their catalog). The crowd is absolutely electric and Paul keeps them gripped in the palm of his hand. Every performance is a winner, but some choice ones to check out are the passionate rendition of A Million to One and I Still Love You, plus an absolute barnstormer of a rendition of Lick It Up.

Vocally, this show is the last document of Paul being in prime vocal form, before 2008 onward showcased a serious decline in his vocal ability that sadly has gotten worse with each passing year.

The sound and picture quality are both excellent, and One Live Kiss is an absolutely essential documents for Kiss fans.",1453420800,,1152,4.6600985221674875

And Paul is spot on. That tells me they didn't use alot of electronics to change to sound. If you are a huge Kiss fan, then this is a fun concert to see. I've seen Kiss in concert a few times and Paul is the reason why. His voice is great and he gets the audience involved.

The lead guitarist, Rafel Moreina really wails, and keyboards and vocals- Paul Mircovich are awesome as well as the others. For any Paul Stanley fan, this DVD is a must have!

At least this worked on my Pioneer dvd player, which I have hooked to a convential stereo amp. This dvd has no real analog 5.0 or allows for downmixing to 2.0. It has either 2.0 OR a DTS 5.0 mix that will set itself by default -the reason that triggers the glitch- and probably will play only through a modern DTS-capable receiver,  .

It's a little tempermental, but it has this really cool feature to reconfigure the picture to my personal desire. Loading, loading... loading... loading.. loading... loading... loading... I gave a full 3 minutes and my player didn't even acknowledge the existance of this disc. It didn't say ERROR or BAD DISC. It simply would not recognize the disc. Then I tried my RCA dvd player, which doesn't have the picture reconfiguration feature, but tends to play problem discs a lot better. Loading... loading... loading... loading... I gave that one 2 full minutes. Same thing, no recognition of the dvd. I had only one player left. A magnavox dvd recorder. Loading... loading...loading After only 1 minute. a full 60 seconds. The player acknowledged the dvd. Then of course came the infamous NO SOUND problem. You have to take it off 5.1 and set it to 2.0 to get the sound. Which is so totally stupid. Why have a 5.1 that doesn't work. This is one lousy dvd. If you really want to see Paul Stanley at his best, look for a bootleg video called Paul Stanley Live at Toad's Place. Trust me, It blows this one out of the water.  Shaky camera? Yes, but you get a vicious ruthless Paul Stanley. And If you want to see an awesome and probably the best ""concert on video"" show, get TWISTED SISTER LIVE AT THE ASTORIA.

I simply LOVE this DVD. It has live music that I have always wanted to hear played at a KISS concert. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. I am still a little naive about DVD/CD music.

Bottom line, put make up on the House Band and tour with them! This was a great show, sound quality always helps and this dvd sounded really good. The lead guitar player is amazing! he can play any solo to a tee, but its much better when he plays it 80% to the original and then goes off and does ""his"" thing with the rest.
Paul sounds great! and is pretty much concentrating on putting on a good performance and not too much about the antics he does with Kiss, although a few come out here and there.
The song selection was overall really good, could have done without one or two if his choices and would have love to have heard All hell's breaking loose, Exciter,or Creatures of the night.
I heard Pauls solo cd. live to win, and thought it was just ok.. but after watching this show, I gave the cd a 2nd chance and it's growing on me,, I did purchase the live cd.
I highly recomend this dvd to any Kiss fan, and Stanley fan, and any fan of great live rock music.",1259452800,,1092,4.15566037735849

GET THIS DVD!",1252886400,,328,4.45
3597373,4,B001G7FTB6,"he Good
Who would have expected a live DVD by Paul Stanley to help promote his 2006 solo album Live to Win? Perhaps the greatest part of the performance isn't so much the solo material, but the seldom preformed Kiss material. Don't get me wrong, I loved the music from Live to Win, but when was the last time you heard ""Hide Your Heart"" and ""Lick It Up"" at a live Kiss show? I would say sometime during their make-up free years.

The anthemic ""Live to Win"" sets the pace and the energy and melody level never stops. The are four more songs from the solo album and two from Stanley's first solo effort in 1978. From there on it's all Kiss material. Certainly not your typical Kiss material either. Sure you get ""Detroit Rock City,"" ""Strutter,"" and ""Love Gun,"" but there are a few others you'll be scratching you head wondering, where have I heard that one before?

The Bad
I'm not so much a technical guy, but there is something wrong with the sound mix. I listened to both the stereo mix and the 5.1 mix, and both lacked in bass. Also, it sounded like they were singing into a tin can at times. At first I thought it was my DVD player, until I popped in another live DVD and all was well.

I also take exception to introduction tracks, for they are not needed. Especially when it's a millionaire telling you how he fought his way up from the streets to become a success. Please! If you believe that one, I have some swamp land in Florida to sell you.

The Verdict
One Live Kiss is a great collection of Paul Stanley solo tracks and Kiss material. You can tell that the live show must have been an electric experience. It just too bad that the electricity couldn't be contained properly.",1251936000,,1686,4.3428571428571425

On this tour Paul surrounded himself with some of the best I have ever seen. The House Band of Rockstar/INXS/SuperNova are off the wall good. I'm familiar with every song on this dvd ,but I've never heard them played like that. Especially when he does some of the older Kiss tunes. This tour had to be a lot of fun for Paul,I don't imagine the performances were anywheres near as exhausting as a Kiss show. On a scale of one to ten I give this dvd a seventy eight.",1250035200,,628,4.285714285714286
3597376,4,B001G7FTB6,"Well, I popped in the DVD and at the main menu playing ""Live To Win,"" I pushed play.  It went to the intro but there was no sound. Hmmmm, well I know the DVD has audio because the main menu did.  So I clicked the Dolby Stereo option and, low & behold, there was audio!  Problem solved (I'm assuming the 1-star ratings were from those who didn't take a few seconds to experiment with the features).  Seems odd to have to do that, but oh well.

Paul says at the beginning of the show that he wants to play his favorites and, coincidentally, a lot of those songs turned out to be some of my favorites and some of those are not played often if hardly at all.  ""A Million To One"" is my favorite off Lick It Up, hands down.  ""Magic Touch"" I LOVE that song!  Paul's first solo album was awesome and ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" is one of the best tracks on that record. Paul announced he was waiting about 17 years to play it live (it's much better than ""Move On"" which he played on the Dynasty tour and is also performed on this DVD).  ""Good Bye"" is another favorite of mine from his first solo album and he ends the show with it.  Here are the tracks in order: Live To Win, Hide Your Heart, A Million To One, Got To Choose, Move On, Bulletproof, Tonight You Belong To Me, Lick It Up, Wouldn't You Like To Know Me?, Magic Touch, I Still Love You, Strutter, Everytime I See You Around, Do You Love Me, I Want You, Love Gun, Lift, Detroit Rock City, and Good Bye (Where Angels Dare during the end credits).

The usual hits sound excellent on this DVD.  ""Got To Choose,"" in particular, has a very rich sound with all the extra instruments.  The DVD includes a little booklet with photos of Paul and his band.  The short prologue with the black & white photos was a nice way to introduce the show, I guess, but nothing spectacular: Paul talking about ""dreams"" and all. The ""follow your dreams"" line is just overused, I think (it doesn't do anything for me in my advanced years after the reality of the world has already crushed my spirits).  Paul sounds great, of course.  He kills ""I Still Love You.""  The show was filmed at House of Blues Chicago on November 6, 2006.  And if any Paul Stanley fans haven't gotten the ""Live To Win"" CD yet (I guess there may still be one or two out there), buy it too because it kicks!",1246752000,,2307,4.204545454545454
3597377,4,B001G7FTB6,"This a very good DVD. I don't know how much of it was ""doctored"" at the studio, but he sound here is simply nearing perfection. All instruments are crystal clear.

The House Band performs admirably, seasoned pros like they are. The first songs begins with the usual modern trend of headache-inducing editing but, fortunalety, editing slows down soon after.

Of course, Paul can be very annoying sometimes, moments when you can sense his ego taking the world... But these are minor claims compard to the amazing music you'll get in this DVD.",1245974400,,540,4.858695652173913

I'm more into Gene's material but this a great addition to my KISS collection. The sound quality is excellent. Although, I don't think Paul should talk as much in between each song if you know what I mean ""PEOLPLE"". He is definately somewhere in the top 5 for greastest rock voices of all time. (I would love to have a velvet picture of Paul, Geddy Lee, Steve Perry, Roger Daltrey & Jon Anderson (Yes) sitting around playing cards instead of those dogs.) I have to say after all these years Paul still has that new car scent. He is just as excited to play as he was many yrs ago. I don't just mean this DVD or in any concert but in all his interviews he's still like a kid in a candy store. I'd like to shake his hand just for that. Then I'd ask him to let me play bass for him. lol!",1244332800,,940,4.032085561497326

3597380,1,B001G7FTB6,"I've been a die-hard Kiss fan since 1976; my childhood was linked to Kiss. But I must say that for me, Kiss came to an end already back in 1983. With the make-up off, and Ace and Peter gone, Kiss became a boring ""has-been hitband"" trying to copy the Stars of the 80's and the 90's(David Lee Roth, Jon Bon Jovi, Guns'n Roses, Nirvana, as well as others). Of course, I was sincerely happy in 1996 with the ""Reunion Tour"", but disappointment was there once again with the ""all-fake"" ""You wanted the best, you got the best"" album, and the two years later very weak ""Psycho Circus"" album. Now, when I heard, back in 2004, Paul was working on a second solo-album, I was really thrilled. Indeed, Paul's first solo-album should have had, according to me, much more success than it gained, because it's a really good ""gentle hard-rock"" album with several potentially hit songs (and compared to Gene's solo album it's much, much, much better). And I do think that ""Live to win"" is a quite good CD. Of course, it's not all what I would like Kiss to sound like, but it's the pure expression of Paul Stanley with ""overdone"" Desmond Child/Bon Jovi style.
But watching the DVD ""One Live Kiss"" reveals to me -no matter how strong the songs sound and how professional the musicians are - how uninteresting Paul is without his make-up outside classic Kiss! I mean, he acts exacly in the same way he always has done onstage with Kiss, except that he's on his own now! I thought he would be able to appear in a more, let's say, sober way. But not at all! For example, my ears just feel soared when he's screaming (like he's used to do) at the end of the annoying ""I still love you"" song! Can't anybody (Doc McGhee for instance...) just tell him to shut up and go on with the concert without making a fool of himself! And when Paul intoduces the (marvellous) musicians of his ""House Band"" onstage, it's just dullness he serves us. Who the hell does he think he is? He doesn't have, outside Kiss and without make-up, any of the stage charisma such musicians like David Lee Roth, Rob Halford or Freddie Mercury - among many others -, have or had. Paul Stanley of his own is a crystallisation of triviality and owerflowing self-esteem. By the way, apparently Paul has been consulting a shrink for well over two decades - which is honorable - but why does he feel compelled to give as a lesson about ""Success principles"" we can learn ourselves about by buying (like Paul has...?) for example ""Chicken soup for the Soul""? Maybe that's a way for Paul Stanley to fudge those though years between 1980 and 1996 when Kiss was largely considered as a ""ridiculous"" and ""has-been"" rock band?
Paul, for me, was the ""Starchild"" only when he was playing with Gene, Peter and Ace in Kiss during the 70's. Today, I look at him as an narcisstic ""I've-done-it-all-and-I'm-the-best"" very average musician who's got only one real interest in life: get your money! No need to let him get even more rich than he already is by buying this DVD!",1242518400,2,2998,4.523020257826888

3597382,5,B001G7FTB6,"This is a great DVD.  I have been a KISS fan for 30 years...but have never seen Paul solo.  This is a great concert...and I love the song selection.  Lots of stuff from Paul's '78 solo record, some classic KISS, and some KISS songs I have never heard live.  The back up band is also smokin'.  If you are a KISS fan, you can't go wrong with this DVD.",1239062400,,349,4.0
3597383,4,B001G7FTB6,"Full disclosure...I am a KISS fan.

That being said, this concert DVD from Paul Stanley's ""Live to Win"" tour contains some of the best renditions of classic KISS tunes that I've ever heard - both cover versions, originals, and various live lineups.

The band sounds amazingly tight (they completely nail ""Hide Your Heart"") and it's clear they're having a blast playing.

The prologue at the beginning is a bit boring and overlong to someone very familiar with Paul and his career, but it would be modestly interesting to someone totally new to him and his music - though I'm sure the core audience would be existing fans anyway.

The video quality is superb.  Although I don't care for rapid camera/angle changes (and there are plenty here), they don't distract very much.  The picture is crisp and colorful.

Sound quality is just as good, and DTS and Dolby Stereo are options.

The DVD insert is 10 pages of well-printed photographs of various performances on the tour and the set list/track listing.  I would have liked to have seen more in the way of liner notes...not just Paul's own thoughts but the bands' as well.  Paul's said plenty about the KISS material already, though notes on the Live to Win stuff would have made a nice read.

As others have said, there are no bonus features - just sound format options and the ability to jump to a specific song.  A featurette or two would have been nice. Rehearsal footage...the usual concert DVD extra stuff.  Lack of extras is the only thing keeping this from five stars.",1237939200,,1525,4.709433962264151

3597399,4,B001G7FTB6,"When it comes to KISS, I've always liked Paul Stanley's songs better than Gene's, and I loved his 1978 solo album. Over the years, Love Gun, Mr. Speed, Magic Touch, Sure Know Something and Psycho Circus have been some of my favs. I was lucky to catch PS at the Sunset Strip HOB when he toured in support of Live to Win 2006, and this DVD captures the show eloquently. I'm not as enamored of L2W as I was the 1978 solo effort, but it still has some really excellent tunes, especially the title track. Both solo albums are given good play in the setlist, and there is a sprinkling of rarely played KISS material like Hide Your Heart and the aforementioned Magic Touch. It's great to hear these songs live for the first time along with Tonight You Belong to Me and some of the other songs from the first solo album.

The direction is sharp and the set well paced. Like a lot of people, I would have preferred a 16:9 aspect ratio, but at least the director makes good use of the extra real estate. Such a choice would have worked better for a group concert film though, since Stanley is a solo act and we really don't care too much about the back-up band, as tight as they are.

As to the performance, Stanley is strong and energetic and in fine voice, if a little insecure. It kind of bugged me how he kept asking if the audience they liked the show. Uh, yeah, that's why we're cheering dude. His voice is as strong as ever, especially on I Still Love You and I Want You.

My only real quibble is with the set list. He left off two of my favorites from the 1978 solo album, Love in Chains and It's Alright. I would have much rather heard those than Move On or the umpteenth rendition of Detroit Rock City or Strutter. Oh well, it's his tour, I guess he can play what he wants.

There are no extras, and that's too bad because I would like to have heard an in depth interview or a seen a little bit of backstage stuff.

It's amazing to watch this now a couple years on, because I just saw KISS in Las Vegas last summer and if anything Stanley looked and performed even better than he did in '06. With some recent health problems behind him, he looks tanned and cut for the next big KISS tour next year.

Watching this again, I find myself wishing that he would tour solo more often during down times for KISS. His music may not be poetic or sophisticated, but it is catchy, danceable and Stanley possesses one of the great rock voices of all time. Here's to hoping we all get to hear these songs more often.",1229385600,3,2503,4.2259414225941425

Considering what Kiss have put out in recent years, this is one of the few credible pieces you can get. And, if you are a real fan, go check out Pauls Paintings. I was fortunate to buy two paintings and Paul was a true gentleman. Great works of Art. I can only hope Paul some day does solo #3.

One of my reasons for giving it only 4 Stars was it didn't have extra bonus material, I'm guessing it was a cost issue rather than a creative thing(I hope). My second Issue was that some of the new songs have low register and Paul seems to struggle with that these days. A perfect example of this is his performance in Phantom of the Opera.

The lead vocals on this DVD are great but the back up singers are excellent too (just listen to ""Move on"" !)
The set list is almost perfect though I wish they had played ""Crazy, crazy nights"" instead of ""Lick it up"".

This is Paul Stanley at his very best.  His back-up band is wonderful, but Paul was fantastic!!!!  Let's not even mention his age, but he looks fantastic and his voice was soaring!  I found myself singing along - very loudly, I might add.  It was a great evening -- spent with Paul.

I would highly recommend this DVD for any PS fan.  Hey!  Even if you're not a PS fan, watch this and be converted.  Watching this man give so much energy in his performance will make you appreciate what you're watching.  He is a true performer, a fantastic front man and an unbelievable talent.

It's so good to hear these songs that have been lost to live shows for so long. Not that Gene would ever allow any variety. Paul not only does a great job but he nails every song here. The Klassic ""Magic Touch"" sounds fresh. His solo songs from the first album are amazing. ""Got To Choose"", ""A Million To One"" and even ""Move On"" have stood the test of time. The song list says it all. You'll only hear most of these great songs on a Paul solo tour and it's captured here in excellent quality. This DVD is a must for every KISS and Paul fan alike. If you missed this tour don't worry, this DVD comes through. ""Goodbye"" is the final and best track here. A must have!",1225756800,3,823,4.118012422360248

I wish Paul also would have add Crazy Crazy Nights & Tears are falling to this setlist but perhaps next time or is there still a mastertape from his 1989 Clubtour that is waiting for a DVD release!
Hope Paul will do another Soloalbum soon (wish KISS also will do) and we will see Paul Solo (also in Europe!) & KISS for a long time on the road again.
Just some final words - this DVD is a must buy for every KISS fan, anyway i wished the extra songs Paul did in Australia would have been add as a special!",1225756800,,787,4.083870967741936
3597434,5,B001G7FTB6,"What can I say?  Paul is the reason I became a KISS fan so many years ago.  His voice, eyes, hair (yeah, head and chest)....in a nutshell, him.
With great anticipation I waited for the release of One Live KISS, and I was not disappointed.
Paul's voice sounds stronger today than it did in the beginning....what a set of pipes.  From the sound of his voice in the prologue until the last note of Goodbye...which has always been one of my favorite songs from Paul's 1978 solo release...I was not disappointed.
There were times an audible gasp could be heard from me....Hide Your Heart comes to mind. I was taken back to being a teenage girl in lust with a rock star...THE ROCK STAR....the only one to ever make me weak in the knees. The epitome of the rock frontman.
On to the back up band.  It was strange to see anyone but Gene Simmons, Eric Singer or Tommy Thayer playing behind Paul....but this fine group of musicians did an excellent job. Jim, Sasha, Nate, Rafael and Paul M did the KISS classics and Paul's new songs proud!
Louis Antonelli did a FABU job of putting this DVD together.
To make a long review longer....Guys...you done good....Thank you!",1225756800,,1156,4.543269230769231
3597435,5,B001G7FTB6,"My wife and I, who met at a KISS concert on the Rock The Nation tour in 2004, were at this Paul Stanley show.  Louis Antonelli selected my wife as one of the girls he moved to the front row.  Yes, there is some creative positioning of very attractive women, which I say with complete humility. During one song Paul fell to his knees and grabbed my wife's hands and briefly sang to her.  It happened but I haven't seen it in the DVD.  No question, the show was awesome.  The ""Rock Star INXS"" band, who became Paul's band, was energetic, musically tight and spot on in every single song.  They were a lot of fun to watch and you could tell they were fans of Paul themselves.  We were also at Louis Antonelli's Chicago area pre-screaning.  What a gentleman.  And a truly exceptional producer.  Before the DVD ever came out I was surprised one afternoon when I ran into Mr. Antonelli in a Borders book store near my home.  We had a long conversation about his work with Paul, with KISS, and so on.  I pressured him for the DVD to be released and told him how frustrated Paul/KISS fans were over the very long wait, and even the fans' questioning over whether it would ever come out.  Well, it's out and it's great!  Paul and his band took hold of the Chicago House of Blues audience and never let go.  You will enjoy this DVD and watch it/listen to it many times, as you have with the albums.  Five stars!",1225670400,,1401,4.290076335877862
3597436,5,B001G7FTB6,"This ""movie"" is a performance by a man who is probably the greatest all round rock star. Song writer, vocalist and front-man, he still has no equal on stage. Yes the between-song banter is hammy and the introduction is a bit OTT to say the least, but Paul is quite literally a musical legend and he most certainly lives up to it here. I rate his 1978 solo album, which I have owned for 28 years, as the greatest album ever recorded, and when you see and hear the passion, soul and detail he puts into songs like Tonight You Belong to Me and Goodbye, you cannot help but totally admire this man's integrity. The cornball message is that Paul ""Lives to Win"" - which may be the case. I personally think he lives to give. Winning isn't important for Paul - being the best he can be is. Whether in front of a small crowd or an enormous stadium, Mr. Stanley delivers a first rate performance ever time. The true mark of a professional.

On to the production details. As many have said, the supposed ""Widescreen"" is a little on the dodgy side. If you stretch it to fill your widescreen TV, you will realise the dimensions are correct, whereas if you watch it as it is supposed to be watched, eveything is squeezed down and up - to give the impression this is some kind of ""movie"". I can only imagine this was an artistic idea of Paul's rather than the directors. It seems obvious that this was shot in 16:9 and then squeezed to look like 2.35:1 to give the ""movie feel"". Yes it would have been better shot in High Def, but it's not worth worrying about. Otherwise the show is shot exceptionally well.

Last gripe is the sleeve. What a dreafully tacky cover! After the class of the Kissology series, this looks like a real cheapskate effort from UME.

But, in my book, this is worth every penny just for ""Goodbye"" alone. Absolutely wonderful.",1225670400,,1834,4.404129793510324

It appears that from what Louis Antonelli has said here at amazon he was hired to only make a 'film' the way Louis Antonelli 'talked up' this film/DVD in interviews on the net etc. it sounded like it was gonna have some great extras, but there is none, how sad!

I work at a video production house I use sonic scenarist DVD authoring software every day! (hollywood studio software) I could author a better DVD than this on a bad day! IF I HAD MADE THIS DVD FOR A CLIENT I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOSING SLEEP! & whats with the audio? this should be a secondary option.
As for aspect ratio IT IS IN 16.9 (4.3 letter box is formatted 16.9 video for 4.3 television) you must setup your DVD player & TV correctly.

Louis Antonelli did a great job with the film but the DVD authoring/extras is crappy maby the DVD authoring budget $$$ was tight
that I can understand working in the DVD authoring business my self, but I wanted more from this DVD in terms of extras & it does not deliver.

Maby Paul Stanley wants to milk the fans for more money & release a Blue Ray version later & then give us the extras! or maby they thought this DVD would not sell many units who knows!",1225670400,2,1340,4.247058823529412

WOW! This DVD is amazing.  I knew it was going to be great because its PAUL STANLEY and after going to 6 of his Australian shows I couldn't wait to get my hands on this DVD.  I don't know how he did it but Louis Antonelli captured the atmosphere from one of Paul Stanley's shows perfectly, its magic.  As soon as the music started it was like I was transported back to one of Paul Stanley's shows last year, I can't stop watching it.  This has to be one of the BEST live DVDs I have ever seen.

There was definite camaraderie between the guys and Paul and it shows. And then there is Paul Stanley. This is a classic example of why he has been so successful in the music business for over thirty-five years. The man just keeps getting better and better.

Paul is the heart and soul of KISS. And in a time of sorrow, hearing some of my old greats (KISS fan 25 years+) helped me through a horribly tough day. And reminded me of a happier time in life.

Paul is one of a kind, in a musical, vocal and physically point of view.
This DVD shows how powerful Paul is. Without make up, whithout fire, without costume, without bombs, without a guitar destroyed at the end of the show. If you take away all of those stuff and keep feeling a chill running down your spine, that's why the music remains the most important thing.

The show itself is great as you would expect although it would be pretty hard to mess up filming a band in a small imtimate venue like that. Not sure what all the useless hype about director Louis Antonelli was all about, a six year old could've filmed this show. Sound is awesome, very live & raw as it should be. I went to 4 Australian shows & what you get on this dvd is 100% what you see live.
My only gripe is that they basically advertised for over a year that a ""Live To Dream"" doco would be included. Instead all we got was a dull prologue intro with information we all already know about Paul anyway. KISS fans have long memories and are the only ones going to buy this, and from reading some of the other reviews others wanted the extra features too. We saw footage/pictures a of Paul interview from his house, soundcheck, meet & greets etc but it all hit the cutting room floor. Look at the new RUSH dvd coming out next month. 3 discs packed with concert footage and extras for the same price as One Live Kiss.",1225238400,16,1287,4.172690763052209

3597452,5,B001G7FTB6,"How could you go wrong? The best front man in rock, infront of the best house band you can get, with the best songs from the Paul Stanley catalogue. Add to this very nice photography and a show that has pretty much been left un-cut and still makes you feel like you are there watching it as part of the crowd. Having witnessed most of the Australian Paul shows this is a fantastic souvenier of a wonderful tour. Highlights abound musically but perhaps 'Million To One' is my personal favourite but its hard to ignore the majestic 'Tonight You Belong To Me' which Paul is rewarded with at the end with chants of Paul, Paul, Paul from the adoring crowd. Indeed many of the songs benefit from less ""forceful"" delivery that would normally be applied in the less light and shade trappings of a Kiss show.  Paul's strength is his ability to write stellar pop rock one moment and then balls out rock the next, but he provides a nice balance with this setlist. Thoroughly recommended in that I think I will play this over and over again and it won't collect dust.

3597455,4,B001G7FTB6,"For those of us who missed the tour (the show wasn't advertised in my area and when I heard about it, it was already sold out), this is a good way to experience Paul's second solo tour.

I said ""good"" in the last paragraph for a reason.  The performance is top notch.  Paul still sounds great even after 35 years.  The sound is excellent.  The band is super tight.  The cinematography is top notch. But, something went horribly wrong putting it to DVD.

The original comments from the director stated that this video was not meant to be viewed on HD TVs and that the aspect ratio was meant to be something akin to 1.35:1, as well as commenting that this was not shot using Hi-Def cameras meaning that the picture was not going to be Hi-Def quality.

Okay, that's all well and good, but it still doesn't explain why I'm watching a concert that almost looks like I downloaded it off of YouTube.

For those of you who know the format, DVDs can normally hold 2-3 hours of high quality picture depending on the disc used.  You can add more video, but to do that you end up losing resolution in the picture.  What you start seeing block-like objects in the picture.  Keep going further and you'll start to see something that looks similar to the ""Fell In Love With A Girl"" video by The White Stripes.  Watch that video from 1 minute and 21 seconds in with the LEGO ""girl"" character looking over her shoulder and you'll see what I mean.

While the picture isn't that block-y in appearance, it certainly does show artifacts that indicates this is not a DVD quality picture.  You could almost argue that this is a SVCD-quality release, or somewhere in between.  Even watching this in the standard aspect on my Hi-Def TV reveals this problem which, sadly, is the only thing keeping me from giving this release a 5-star rating.  I don't fault the director of this video because, for all we know, this could be a production issue.

If you're a Kiss fan, a fan of Paul's solo work or both, you'll enjoy watching this concert.  It's a great document of a performance by one of Rock's better showmen.  It's just a shame that this release is tainted by the quality of the picture.",1225065600,3,2164,4.458015267175573

I'm calling it a release, instead of a ""DVD"", because in order to legally carry the DVD logo your product must have a default Dolby Digital audio track, this has a ""DTS"" default. Should this product be recalled? I think so. Sad, sad, sad.

If you don't own an HDTV, you'll probably enjoy this release very much. For the rest of us, I already returned my copy.",1224979200,4,574,4.457142857142857

Paul's choice of songs on this DVD are many and varied, spanning his whole illustrious career with KISS, including both of his solo works.  Stanley's vocals sound incredible, and his energetic and passionate stage performance belies his 'more mature' current age.  Kudos must also be given to his backing band, who were the guys from the 'Rock Star' TV show.  I was pleasantly surprised at how 'tight' they played.  I must also add that the sound, camera work/angles, and overall production values come across as very professional, with all the energy and exhuberance of this live performance captured perfectly by Lou Antonelli and company.  GREAT JOB guys... this is how a live DVD should be done!  A 'must own' for any fan of the legendary, iconic KISS and Paul Stanley!",1224892800,2,907,4.888888888888889
3597459,4,B001G7FTB6,"Great show, lousy job on getting it to DVD.  Regardless of what Mr. Louis Antonelli says, there is NO excuse for not having a default soundtrack selected if one just chooses to play the DVD.  The aspect ratio is also a mess.  No excuse to not show in 16:9 format when you wind up cutting the tops off heads on half the close ups and cutting the bottoms off guitars when zooming in on guitar solos. Just plain sloppy.  Also, doesn't look like the aspect ratio is even correct on some shots as things look slightly shorter/fatter than they should be. Video seems to be overcompressed as well with very visible compression blocks/artifacts throughout as well as horizontal banding on some shots. A consumer product like Canopus Pro would have done a better job than what was used for this DVD.

That said, it's a fantastic performance by Paul Stanley that should not be missed.  Just a shame that he didn't find someone with a little more experience producing DVD's.",1224892800,2,963,4.635294117647059
3597460,5,B001G7FTB6,"This will be short and sweet.

I watched the DVD last night, and I was VERY happy with the production, the band, and especially Paul's vocals.  I've seen KISS +20 times in my lifetime, and this isn't quite the ""KISS Paul Stanley.""  Paul is a bit more relaxed, and his vocals are not forced as they often are in their live shows.  He really shows his range, and ability to hit and hold a note.

The song selection is really fantastic.  Great KISS hits, good songs from Paul's solo LP with KISS, and Live To Win.  My favorite by far on this DVD is ""Hide Your Heart"" - probably my favorite non-makeup KISS song.

For $12 on Amazon, you really can't get much better of a deal.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1224806400,,702,4.257575757575758
3597461,5,B001G7FTB6,i want to just say this is a MUST Get! Ive been following Paul and his music for nearly 30 years and Louis did an awsome job capturing Paul at his best and the music on it spans from Live to Win to His first solo album back in 78 and lots of KISS Classics! AWSOME! Paul is truly the best frontman of all time!,1224720000,,309,3.769230769230769
3597462,5,B001G7FTB6,"Great job Lou -- excellent sound and camera work and the format was superb. Paul...it goes without saying -- you had 'it' when you started the band in 1973 and you still have 'it' today. The consumate professional in both music and now art.

Thank you for 30 + years of inspiration and entertainment!

3597463,5,B001G7FTB6,"First off I would like to say a few things about Louis Antonelli, the Director of ""One Live Kiss"". My son and I recently had the pleasure of meeting Lou. I walked away from that experience not only having made a new friend, but also having the honor of having him share his insight into this film. What I learned from our first meeting was that Lou is  FAN first and foremost!! The man truly is a life long fan of not only Paul, but Kiss. He was introduced to Kiss ""back"" in 1974 and has been a ravenous fan ever since. Not the ""stalker"" type of fan, but one who truly enjoys the single most important (and often times overlooked because of the band's larger than life image) aspect of Kiss, that is the music. There is simply no way this band would have survived all of these years on image alone, it's the music which stands the test of time. Lou understands that from not only a fan's perspective, but from a director's perspective as well. He truly ""gets it"" and it comes through here. Hands down, this is simply the single best Kiss related DVD ever to emerge. Lou captures the energy of the performance and manages to prove the unquestionable point, that it's the MUSIC, not the ""make-up, smoke and fire"" that matters most. If ever there was an argument that Kiss was only about image, here's your chance to silence all those who would make that argument. This DVD is more than just a performance video, it is a true testimony of the power of the music created by Paul Stanley. No other single video product has EVER come close to documenting this simple fact, until now. If we could only get the likes of one Paul McCartney to give Lou a chance behind the lense we could finally get a true solo performance testament to that man as well. Thanx Lou.",1224720000,,1755,4.36697247706422
3597464,5,B001G7FTB6,"AS stated you do need to set the sound yourself or it won't work. Bad idea. This dvd tends to hang if you want to jump around on the tracks. I think this would have been allot better if you would have just shot the show and not tamper with audio tracks and video. ITs a great dvd, I just don't like the tampering. Just give us the raw photoage and the sound through the sound board. Like may other kiss dvds and such I'm sure a bootleg will surface that will be better.",1224720000,,469,4.0
3597465,3,B001G7FTB6,"I understand you can't please everyone and there will always be something wrong to someone,,,,,

every review here is dead on,,,,,

the show on this DVD is clean great production, sound is great,,,

the gripe I have with it is that  ""and kiss and Paul fans are use to""  putting out stuff over the top.

This DVD is not over the top,,, meaning Packaging, extras, behind the scenes, sound checks, on the road, ect......

don't get me wrong,,,, the show is killer and who ever put his concert out it still would be great cuz it is Paul Stanley,

but what happened to the package,,,, the behind the scenes,,, I really don't get it....

unless Paul just wanted to put out the concert and thats it.

It would of been cool to have some hidden extras too with maybe footage of Paul in Kiss doing the forever by himself.

just an idea,,,

I was disappointed with the fact there not one extra feature on the disc, other than sound choices.

I remember seeing footage of this before it came out and it had interviews with fans waiting in line ect.......

they scrapped all that,,,, Im sure there was a good reason but just sharing my feelings of the disappointment.

but I say buy it anyway cuz Paul is in top form... sounds tight and very good.

only song did not think was as good when kiss play's it was Detroit Rock City, mainly in the beginning,

but I still need to watch the whole dvd, I just skimmed thru it in my car dvd and when I tried to watch it at home the sound did not work

so now reading the review on this web site from the guy who made it regarding no sound I will go home and try that.

dvd is still great for any kiss fan or Paul fan.",1224720000,5,1645,4.181528662420382
3597466,5,B001G7FTB6,"I just got ""One Live Kiss"" in the mail and I IMMEDIATELY watched it. Well, ""watched it"" is an understatement... let's say I ""experienced it""... cause it is TRULY an ""experience"" which could've only been topped by being there LIVE. Paul.. after YEARS in the business, is STILL in top form, folks. He takes command of a stage in a way that few can.

This dvd... this show... is a celebration of Paul Stanley... while there is positive recognition of his ""Kisstory"" with THE Hottest Band in the World, this is solely about Paul himself... a landmark film showcasing the talents and extraordinary showmanship of Mr. Stanley.

I have been a fan of KISS since I was 6 years old (the makeup caught my attention.. I saw them as superheroes), and I'm here to tell you, people... BUY this DVD if you haven't yet!!! You won't regret it. It's filled with great music, great production, great musicians...

Thank you Paul for giving us, the fans, this gift... I will treasure this film as I have treasured everything in my KISS collection. Please continue to do more new projects (KISSwise or otherwise)...

And speaking as a KISS fan, don't believe any negative things you may hear.... We'd LOVE new KISS tunes... KISS is still alive and well... and you're one of the main reasons for it.

You always say it is the band that is thankful that we the fans are here.... WE thank you for wanting to be. We love you guys.",1224720000,2,1404,4.555555555555555
3597467,5,B001G7FTB6,"Having attended Paul's solo show in Baltimore and being awed at Paul and the band's powerful performance, I've been waiting for a film version of the show.  I also had the great fortune of attending the world premiere event for One Live Kiss in St. Charles, IL this past weekend, where the film was viewed on a theater screen with theater sound.  What Mr. Antonelli captured and produced is so much more than a standard concert video--it truly is something that can be watched over and over.  I found myself at points reliving the feelings of being AT Paul's show.  This is a spectacular film from two gifted artists (Paul and Mr. Antonelli). After watching the film there is no doubt that Paul Stanley is a talented musician and performer.  His command of the stage and connection with the audience should be studied by anyone who dares to set foot on a stage.  Since I'm not a filmmaker, it's difficult for me to describe, but Mr. Antonelli is able to put Paul and the audience's passion into the film.  You really feel it watching this.  I believe this film, if taken seriously, could rank with Last Waltz, Woodstock and the Song Remains the Same.  Thank you, Mr. Antonelli, for this gift to the fans!",1224633600,2,1204,4.588785046728972
3597468,5,B001G7FTB6,"I love Kiss, I love Paul. With that out of the way, let's get to the stats. I'm a Blu ray fan as well.

The video is presented in a ""full screen"" format, like some other reviewers have mentioned, was probably shot in full frame. If that's the case, then you're seeing it the way it was meant to be seen.

Sound, it's a tricky little beast.

I have a full home theater set-up and am able to receive all of the signals in hidef, lossy, etc...

One Live Kiss is presented in a 48/192 kbps stereo track which BLOWS. Sorry, it's the truth and will never watch it with this setting on.

The DTS track is presented in a ""5.1"" DTS lossy track which is constant at 1.5 mbps--it's pretty killer!!!!! Here's some more confusion, it should have been labeled ""5.0"", because I get NO low end off of the subwoofer. There's plenty of bass from the speakers, ZERO low end from the sub.

If you want to get technical, it's DTS ""5.0"" ""lossy""surround sound.

I hope it gets a 96/24 bit treatment when it gets ported over to Blu ray, I will be double dipping for sure.",1224633600,,1047,4.231155778894473
3597469,3,B001G7FTB6,"As a die hard KISS fan, I was so looking forward to this DVD for the longest time, knowing that it's been in the works for some time. That being said, hearing about HOW it was shot, with high definition cameras, etc, I assumed the presentation would be in a 16X9 aspect ratio, enhanced for widescreen TV's, etc. Not so. Unless I'm missing something, or have missed a setting somewhere on my DVD player, TV, or remote(you have to check all of these now!), I think we are getting a 4X3 letterboxed presentation. If that's the case, what a shame. This DVD and show deserved better. If they shot it wide screen, why not present it widescreen? I also want to add that the DVD was shot great and sounds amazing, and I hate to even say anything negative because I have supported KISS all my life, but this aspect ratio thing was something I felt I needed to speak out about.",1224547200,2,867,4.3580246913580245
3597470,5,B001G7FTB6,"It's not just the music or the theatrics that keeps me going as a die-hard fan for 31 years. It's the fact that KISS, Especially Paul, continues to work hard to give a great performance. After 3 decades in the business, Paul Stanley is clearly still The Greatest Frontman Of All Time!",1224547200,2,284,4.480769230769231
3597471,5,B001G7FTB6,"I cannot say enough good things about One Live KISS. I have been a die-hard KISS fan for most of my life, and no matter how many times one has seen the band or its members live in concert, it's very difficult for a filmmaker to truly capture that experience. There's usually something lacking that clearly makes you feel like an outsider watching through a television screen versus living, breathing, and feeling the concert experience explode around you.

But One Live KISS does just that. It's an absolutely incredible masterpiece of a concert. Paul Stanley has never looked or sounded better, and his connection with the audience is strong, solid, and at times, humorous too. At one point, a fan almost out-sings him, and Paul smirkedly remarks ""Well... GOODNIGHT everyone!"" as laughter erupts. You feel like you're squeezed right into the packed House of Blues along with everyone else.

The camerawork is tight and precise, and director Lou Antonelli does exactly what most filmmakers fail at when attempting to capture a live concert experience -- he lets the show tell itself. The camera does not focus on Paul 100% of the time. There's plenty of the band here to satisfy everyone (especially some fantastic footage of Nate Morton pounding the skins) and the shots of the crowd, both close and wide, truly capture the intensity, energy, and overall vibrant experience of being there.

And I know... because I was there when this was shot. I had the privilege of seeing several shows on the Live to Win tour as well as being at the Chicago HOB during the filming. This video perfectly and quintessentially captures everything that happened that night... and wraps it nicely up in cellophane for you to take home and enjoy.",1224460800,9,1728,4.870748299319728
3597472,5,B001G7FTB6,"I was fortunate to be at the World Premiere of ""One Live KISS"" and it took by breath away.  It begins with the heartwarming narative of Paul's early years and then blows your mind with Paul's amazing performance at Chicago's House of Blues!  Louis Antonelli's work makes you feel like you are right there in the front row!  Well done, 5 stars!",1224460800,,343,4.5
3597473,5,B001G7FTB6,"Had a chance to see the brand new Paul Stanley concert movie ""One Live Kiss"" today and seeing it on the big screen was almost as good as seeing the show live. I should know, I was there. Filmed by Lou Antonelli at the popular Chicago House of Blues venue, the Chicago fans were rabid for some high-powered rock-n-roll. A good amount of them showed up at the Arcada Theater in St. Charles, IL this evening to get a big-screen, full-length peek at this musical masterpiece.

The DVD will be officially released on Tuesday, October 21st. ""One Live Kiss"" features a great song selection, spanning the entire career of the quintessential frontman. Including such hits as Love Gun, Lick It Up, and Detroit Rock City, Stanley also played selections from his Live To Win solo effort and some never or rarely performed live deep cuts. Kiss classics such as Magic Touch from the Dynasty album and A Million To One were the highlights of this show.

Antonelli did a fabulous job making the House of Blues look like a stadium setting. Multiple cameras and a robust 24-track audio mix really puts you right into the right frame of mind to rock, so well in fact that you'll sometimes forget you are watching a movie.

As a long time Kiss fan, I've seen every incarnation of the band and each was spectacular in its own way. However, what Antonelli captured here is a must-have for any fan of good rock and roll. Seeing Paul stripped down without his trademark makeup, costumes and gimmicks let his music do the talking. And it spoke in volumes. Backed by the House Band from the show Rock Star, they take the Kiss classics to a new musical level. The intimate setting combined with a raw power I haven't seen from Paul since his previous solo tour in 1989, there is a reason why this DVD is the talk of the hard rock music world - it's as good as it gets!",1224460800,5,1841,4.473214285714286
3597474,5,B001G7FTB6,"If the previews I have seen are any indication of how the rest turn out, this will be the greatest KISS DVD yet... because... it is MINT... I mean...  KISS songs never sounded so good... even to the point that these are better than the studio versions in many cases.  That is how it felt when I was at this show in person... and I am glad to see the audio came through living up to the reality of that night.  That band... kicked total azz!!!  Paul, complimented by impeccable talent at every position, was amazing!  I am 100% positive that this DVD will be worth every cent and then some...  I don't think I have been looking forward to any release more than this one in the past 10 years...  Since the show was nearly 2 years ago... I have literally been searching for release date info on this thing EVERY month since then.  I also ""look forward"" to seeing how stupid or not I look in the crowd.  I was about 3rd or 4th row of people back, dead center.  In fact, I would have been closer except at the last minute they brought women up to take up the front area... which kinda sucked, and yet, I understood it (it is for all of our own benefit when watching the DVD).  The fact that I will likely show up in some crowd shots makes this DVD interesting to me even if it wasn't good... but, really... it is the set list and their execution of it that was amazing that night and the DVD looks to take it to the next level with outstanding mixing of the audio and cutting of the video.

This was one of those shows where you were emotionally sad when it ended... sad because it ended... and sad because of all the people you know that you WISH could have seen it with you.  It was truly magical... and every bit as good as the best actual KISS concerts you have ever seen.  Instead of the big stage and pyro... strip that away and add musical precision that was breathtaking... (and considerably greater than KISS has ever accomplished live as a band... just speaking the truth).  Of all the KISS members in history.... only Eric Singer and Paul could have truly hung with the musical abilities of this band... which, again, is not meant as a knock on KISS... more as a nod to the incredible work of the Rockstar band that backed Paul... they made it twice as exciting as if it were just a Paul solo tour without them.  Paul made the perfect choice by getting them to go out with him... and if possible, I think he should do it again sometime... they were amazing together.  One other note: some fans found Paul's Live to Win CD a little lackluster... but, when this band hits the stage to the title track... it is as powerful as any of the greatest KISS songs.  This show was part of a very small set (out of hundreds) for me personally:  one of the greatest concerts I have ever witnessed.  If you are a KISS fan, you MUST own this.  If you are a hard rock fan who isn't much of a KISS fan, you will be surprised by how much you love this.  If you just loved the Rockstar band... you will love this.  I bet even people who do not like harder rocking things would find this enjoyable.  This show/DVD is a gift to everyone!",1224374400,,3122,4.217171717171717
3597475,5,B001G7FTB6,"I saw the preview in Indy a few months back and knew this would be something special. After an agonizing wait I finally was able to see the entire film last weekend in Dayton, OH. It was amazing. It was worth it.

The film starts out with Paul talking about his life. I finally understand Paul's ""Live to win"" motto. It is obvious that an insane amount of time, dedication, and love went into this production.

Director Louis Antonelli & Paul Stanley hit this one out of the park. Unlike a lot of concert videos there is a huge emphasis on actually seeing all of the artists on stage and the crowd interacting. The camera shots and lighting are just superb. You are drawn right in. You feel like you are really there experiencing Paul Stanley's ""LIVE to Win"" tour from the best seats in the house!

Unlike a regular concert DVD you actually see the interaction between Paul and the band members. You see the crowd. You get the feeling that this is less about Paul and more about the magic that is being created on stage. And there is a reason. According to Lou Antonelli in his Q and A Session at the Dayton Kiss Expo, Paul actually asked him to have ""less Paul"" and more of everyone else. That's just the kind of guy Paul is. Lou and Paul are true artists and their canvas is full of beautiful imagery, heart-pumping energy, and the heavenly mix of classic Kiss tunes and Paul Stanley originals.

I wish everyone could listen to Lou talking about the passion, the drive, and the energy that was put into this film by everyone involved. Lou Antonelli can be proud of this creation. You wanted the best, you got the best: In ""One Live Kiss"" Paul Stanley once again demonstrates that he can put an incredible team together to deliver an exceptional concert experience. ""One Live Kiss"" from Paul Stanley and Louis Antonelli is going to be remembered right up there with ""Alive"" in Kisstory.",1224028800,2,1887,4.508771929824562

Now on to the DVD, One Live Kiss. I got to see the first full screening of Paul's DVD at the Dayton,OH Kiss Expo on Saturday, Oct. 11th. This DVD is SO worth the wait. Watching this transported me right back to Baltimore, Oct. 26, 2006. This DVD allows the watcher to experience the phenomenon that is Paul Stanley in the ultimate surroundings. Lou Antonelli captured perfectly that up-close & personal, intimate feeling that Paul's shows all had. This movie puts you right there front & center. It makes you forget, at times, that this is a movie & not live. You catch yourself wanting to clap & jump up & down just like at the real show.

Lou Antonelli & Paul Stanley have outdone themselves. They have put together an amazing show. This DVD is definitely the next best thing to actually being there live.",1223942400,,993,4.391304347826087
