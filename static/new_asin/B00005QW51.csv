Cast: Sonny Chiba
 I am a fan of Sonny Chiba. Not a huge fan but a fan nonetheless.  Okay I'm going to be honest I bought this film for a dollar and have seen it at least 10 times. The version I own is from Digiview Productions and is poor quality and is probable cut. This film is authentic Sonny Chiba and it is a good movie don't get me wrong. Well for the price I paid for it I guess it was worth it.",1198800000,,422,3.772727272727273

7950918,1,B00005QW51,"Sonny Chiba can be called a poor man's Bruce Lee...full of attitude, self-taught, great martial artist, but flops around like a great white shark on the deck of party boat!  Sonny truly is the final answer to critics who say you can't make it on guts, emotion, furrowed brows and monkey-do kung fu.  I can't get behind this DVD because it doesn't even list what the heck we're talking about.  But, if you're at all interested, track down the out of print double-features that bring the top six Chiba films out of retirement.",1013126400,2,524,4.612903225806452
