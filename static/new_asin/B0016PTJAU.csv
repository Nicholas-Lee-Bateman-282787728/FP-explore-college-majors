I do like these. I could do without the mindless banter and silly conversations between the machines. But these aren't for me.

3162834,2,B0016PTJAU,"Looks like it was shot in VHS or Hi8 and converted to DVD - but that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the low production values on the scripts and narration.

It's like this guy notices his kid oogling a piece of heavy equipment and then decides to become a movie producer.  The narration is 3rd rate, the scripts are equally poor, and as I mentioned the photography is about as bad as anything I've ever bought commercially.  I'll bet the producer is a bazillionaire because he sure didn't plow the money back into his product.",1366588800,,531,4.3979591836734695

3162836,5,B0016PTJAU,This is a wonderful video if your kids love trains and buses of anykind.  It goes through all kinds of different trains and what they do and how they work and underground trains.  It is very educational and my grandkids never get bored and they are 4 & 6.  They learn so much and can almost tell me about the whole movie.,1362268800,,321,4.145161290322581

3162839,2,B0016PTJAU,"I really try not to be negative in my reviews so I'll keep this simple:

Pro's:

There is a picture of a train on the Box

Con's:

There are not a lot of trains on this DVD compared to others.
There are too many Buses, Trollies, and Dump Trucks that really just act as filler.
The camera work is poor; often shooting too close to their targets (trains) or only shooting the bottom half of trains.
The female narrator is is is.... well lets just say Im sure she is trying her best.

I Can not recommend this DVD.

I would suggest these two titles for your train lovers:

1) Real Trains for Kids: Mom and Pop video that is chuck full of trains and their daily doings. Really wholesome.
2) Lots and Lots of Trains: Entertaining and instructional with plenty of songs and an abundance of trains.",1359072000,10,791,4.304054054054054

This DVD features real trains in the train yard, and repairing the track.  Our son loves to watch it.  He also watches the other two episodes on the DVD without too much trouble; the transit one contains some trains, and the road building one he likes as well.

There is not a lot going on visually, so your kids won't get ADD from watching them.

I guess not all boys are into machines, but if your kid is, this is a terrific series. There are many different DVDs (not just this Making Tracks set).  You can also watch some of these on Netflix instant streaming sometimes.

3397326,5,B0016PTJAU,"Mighty machines videos are such a simple concept, videoing different types of trucks/vehicles at work and adding voiceover.  My kids (two boys, 5 and 2) are fascinated by all of them and have been for a couple of years.  This one talks about trains at a train yard, city buses and the subway trains.  Very affordable and hours of entertainment.",1386460800,,344,4.7

3397330,5,B0016PTJAU,My son loves to watch the mighty machines videos over and over. While the song is a bit annoying and can stick in my head - it is better than barny or spongebob! A little education and entertainment mixed. I have found a couple of them to be interesting myself (once though - not ten times).,1369180800,,291,4.214285714285714
3397331,2,B0016PTJAU,"Looks like it was shot in VHS or Hi8 and converted to DVD - but that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the low production values on the scripts and narration.

It's like this guy notices his kid oogling a piece of heavy equipment and then decides to become a movie producer.  The narration is 3rd rate, the scripts are equally poor, and as I mentioned the photography is about as bad as anything I've ever bought commercially.  I'll bet the producer is a bazillionaire because he sure didn't plow the money back into his product.",1366588800,,531,4.3979591836734695

3397333,5,B0016PTJAU,This is a wonderful video if your kids love trains and buses of anykind.  It goes through all kinds of different trains and what they do and how they work and underground trains.  It is very educational and my grandkids never get bored and they are 4 & 6.

3397336,2,B0016PTJAU,"I really try not to be negative in my reviews so I'll keep this simple:

Pro's:

There is a picture of a train on the Box

Con's:

There are not a lot of trains on this DVD compared to others.
There are too many Buses, Trollies, and Dump Trucks that really just act as filler.
The camera work is poor; often shooting too close to their targets (trains) or only shooting the bottom half of trains.
The female narrator is is is.... well lets just say Im sure she is trying her best.

I Can not recommend this DVD.

I would suggest these two titles for your train lovers:

1) Real Trains for Kids: Mom and Pop video that is chuck full of trains and their daily doings. Really wholesome.
2) Lots and Lots of Trains: Entertaining and instructional with plenty of songs and an abundance of trains.",1359072000,10,791,4.304054054054054

This DVD features real trains in the train yard, and repairing the track.  Our son loves to watch it.  He also watches the other two episodes on the DVD without too much trouble; the transit one contains some trains, and the road building one he likes as well.

The voice-overs can be a bit over the top or grating at times, but overall are a nice way to transition from the cartoon trains to real-life trains.",1283212800,14,534,4.463917525773196

I'm Spike, the garbage truck"").  I like them because they are simple, educational, and the boys just love the machines.  There is not a lot going on visually, so your kids won't get ADD from watching them.

I guess not all boys are into machines, but if your kid is, this is a terrific series. There are many different DVDs (not just this Making Tracks set).  You can also watch some of these on Netflix instant streaming sometimes.

Watch them with your kids; you would be amazed at how much you learn as well.",1271203200,2,658,4.45
