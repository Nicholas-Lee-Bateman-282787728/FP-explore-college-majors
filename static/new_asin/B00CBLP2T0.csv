5712352,4,B00CBLP2T0,An excellent addition to our collection of Illustra DVD's - as always - my husband and I really enjoyed the 3D animations - the hummingbird tongue was fascinating - as was were the depictions of how the wings flap and the feathers.... but compared to the other Illustra DVD's we both found this one a little less detailed - not that that is necessarily bad - it's ideal for a younger audience compared to say Darwins Dilemma - but part of me couldn't help wondering if this one was rushed out ?  There didn't seem to be as much focus on how the birds functionalities couldn't have evolved ?  That's the worst I could say and I even hate to say it - because the DVD was excellent and we've recommended it to many of our friends.  We haven't found anything like what Illustra does on the market - and so it's great to see something other than force fed Evolution theories.,1370995200,10,870,4.3580246913580245
5712353,5,B00CBLP2T0,"The photography is outstanding, making the video mesmerizing. We couldn't take our eyes off it. The film focused on only a few bird species in detail, which included the hummingbird, the arctic tern, and the starling. Each species has amazing features to ponder. We found the starling flocks containing many thousands of birds especially fascinating.

The details about the hummingbirds were super. How those little hearts could beat so fast, somewhere around 1200 beats per minute (going to have to watch it again soon) boggled me. The speaker said many birds' heart rates are over 500 beats per minute. I know how uncomfortable it feels when my heart approaches 150/min during a bout of atrial fibrillation, but the little guys and gals at the hummer feeder seem perfectly calm and content as they lap the extra concentrated nectar I make for them.

The evidence for intelligent design was clear and compelling. Birds are not glorified, flying lizards. The metabolism, musculature and skeletal systems of birds are perfectly adapted for flight. How all the required features for flight could develop by a long series of fortuitous accidents guided by natural selection requires blind faith, for there is no empirical evidence that birds evolved from some unidentified ancestor.

The presenters compared some human engineering accomplishments of well-designed flying machines, including a tiny, hummingbird like drone to the amazing designs found in birds. The design features in birds are far more elegant and effective that those designed by men. They talked about how evolutionary biologists insist students regard all the design features seen in organisms as development by mutation and natural selection over a nearly infinite span of time. The mantra is that ""anything"" is possible given enough time. A probability becomes a possibility, and that becomes a certainty. But when, the numbers are crunched, the probabilities are pooh-poohed by evolutionists because they are convinced with perfect faith that the universe and life was inevitable.

Evolutionists have speculated endlessly over the origin of birds, but birds are so unlike terrestrial creatures, that evolutionists cannot agree among themselves how it all happened. However, they insist with perfect faith that birds must have evolved from some dinosaur or lizard. The required structural and metabolic changes required to make such a transformation are outside the scope of science, yet evolutionists fill textbooks with ad hoc explanations how such transmutations might have occurred and then considered it virtual and incontrovertible fact.

The film referred to the development of the egg embryo without burdening the viewer with additional technical information concerning molecular biology and related fields. It did mention that the various cell types moved into their proper place as the bird embryo developed. Evolutionists say 97% of a species' DNA is junk because it doesn't code for protein. Clearly, most of a species' genome is involved in development, regulation, and other functions necessary to produce a viable organism.

I know crusading evolutionists are going to give this video a 1-star rating and put it down as stupid and made by ignorant creationists, but that goes with the territory. While atheists generally make up about 10% of the population, they often make up 50% of the reviews on Amazon--trying to stuff the ballot box. I've noticed that any book or film dealing with origins, evidence for God, or intelligent design is attacked by the same crew.

Enjoy the film. It is delightful and informative.",1370908800,22,3600,5.34982332155477
5712354,5,B00CBLP2T0,Awesome film!  You've got to see I! Very impressive and great photography.  Recommend it highly.  This is something you need to see?,1369440000,13,132,4.909090909090909

5712356,5,B00CBLP2T0,"In the best sense of the word, FLIGHT is not so much an argument for intelligent design, as it is a picturesque, graceful tribute to the genius of birds, to honest sense and level-headedness. Let me name anything heavier-than-air that flies, and I'd expect you to show me an instrument designed and engineered--and here's the key--by someone capable of design and engineering.

Helicopters are made of materials found on earth. How long, one might suppose, would those elements need be blown about by wind and sea and time and chance before a helicopter emerged?

FLIGHT says little more than that. But in making the obvious more obvious, it reaches beyond blueprint to visual beauty, beyond execution to emotional ecstasy. Who among us hasn't wanted to fly? Flight's investigation of birds will both amaze and uplift. One cannot ask for more. The film puts our heads on alert and our hearts on the wing.

In February of 1969, a stunning, larger-than-life Boeing 747 rose on its maiden voyage into the sky above Seattle. No one watching its magnificent ascent or its poetic descent on its first glide path believed they were witnessing a mutation of assemblage. Find the current 747 online Wikipedia entry and note the key words of the outline: proposal, design, production, and development. These are not the monikers of accident and chance, whether for the 747 or the starling.

I am grateful to FLIGHT and its makers. It answers questions and dispels nonsense of all kinds. More, it inspires. Beauty and truth always do.",1369094400,57,1523,4.9375
5712357,5,B00CBLP2T0,"This very colorful, informative, well-documented film is all about birds, focusing on a few select examples including hummingbirds, starlets, and arctic terns. It also covers the design of the wing, feathers, and the muscle and bone structure, showing in excellent animation how birds are designed to fly. The film also covers birds development from eggs to adult. At the end it covers some evolution theories as well as design arguments. Highly recommended for all ages.",1369008000,31,471,5.293333333333333
5712358,5,B00CBLP2T0,What an incredible film! The grandeur and design of God has never been so clearly evident as in a bird's feather. My husband and I were astounded by the intricate mechanisms and intricate details that enable a bird to fly . . . and we were equally impressed with the film Flight: The Genius of Birds. We can't wait to share it with the rest of our family.,1368576000,11,355,4.235294117647059

5712362,5,B00CBLP2T0,"I liked it.  I especially liked the Artic tern research.  What good science to geo-track the longest migration, one-way 22K miles.  how exciting.  Over the lifespan:  2.3 million miles of migration--that's like going to the moon and back, 3 times.

You can be a creationist, ID-ist, or evolutionist and do that scientific research.  You can be an Creationist/ID and do evolutionary research too, but you at least won't believe the naturalistic starting point assumptions.

5712369,4,B00CBLP2T0,"Very nice film, quality visuals, easy to enjoy, with the only disappointment being the impoverished arguments for intelligent design at the end.  There is obviously evolution involved in intelligent design, as the first flying machines were far from being 747s.  There are also evolved levels of intelligence at play in all living things, such that intelligence is already an inherent factor in the evolution of life.  Every bird has an amazing brain, and they are not as dumb as stupid humans like to believe.  Also impacting the playing field is the dynamic environment, the quest for survival, the drive to reproduce, the interactions between species, the complexities of the food chain, cooperation, competition, genetic variation, chance, and all manner of variables that the human brain cannot possibly understand in totality.  So we feel wonder and awe, marvel at the beauty of it all, and desperately grasp for an explanation that always falls short, whether it is evolution or the God theory.  That's because we as a species fall short, just like birds, fish, worms, bacteria, and all other living things.  We can make beautiful films like this one on the marvelous adaptation of birds to their natural environment, while at the same time our irresponsible actions and environmental poisons can drive multiple species to extinction.  Enjoy the film, question much, dismiss little, learn a lot, and remain humble and uncertain.",1432425600,,1435,5.208695652173913

5712372,5,B00CBLP2T0,"This is a terrific movie. I previewed it, then showed it to my pre-teen Sunday School class. When I was setting it up to run, one of the children said ""Boring!"", and turned his head away, but within a minute or so of me starting the movie, his head swiveled back, and he was glued to the screen, as were the rest of us. The movie dealt in part with humming birds, and since we have a feeder and enjoy seeing their antics, it was a real eye-opener to see how they're made, and imitated in our technological society. I knew the movie would be good because I already have Metamorphosis, and enjoyed that as well. ""God"" doesn't have to be mentioned, because He's there in the detail.",1428710400,5,679,4.3125

I don't have a problem with people denying the species evolved.

What I have a MASSIVE problem with is people CHARGING me for the privilege of them forcing their religious beliefs on me. If you want to force intelligent design down peoples throats, then surely you shouldnt charge them to do so. Proselytising AND profiting from it?

If they called the film ""Birds are amazing and God created them"" and the description said that it was a defence of intelligent design and an attack on Darwinism then fair enough. People can decide if they want to pay good money to hear that. But the fact is that they purposely hide their agenda in the title and description because they know no one will pay to hear this ridiculous, un-scientific nonsense.",1424217600,6,802,4.714285714285714

Since I had seen some other DVDs that dealt with birds, some of the info I already knew, but this presentation was exceptionally well done.
Watching it had my spirit soaring with eagles!
It is amazing how fantastically designed these creatures are;
bones, lungs, muscles, pulleys, navigation systems, etc., clearly showing a genius designer was involved.",1390089600,,494,4.5

5712431,1,B00CBLP2T0,This is a religious statement not science.  It tries to suck you in with a few facts about birds and then tries to say flight is a product of intelligent design.,1389052800,16,161,4.193548387096774
5712432,4,B00CBLP2T0,The video was especially enjoyable because of its emphasis on the many unique qualities that are necessary for flight.  The computer animation showed clearly just how marvelous these creatures are in every way.  The photography was first rate.,1389052800,4,243,5.368421052631579
5712433,5,B00CBLP2T0,"""If something works well, be sure it was designed to,"" says one of the biologists on this DVD. Then the presentation goes on to show how well birds ""work"". The documentary describes the specialized hollow bone structure, the intricacy of a feather, the amazing musculature of the wings that allow the bird to have the streamlined form that make them such flying machines. The biologists discuss and illustrate the specialized joints of the hummingbird's wing that allow it to fly forward, backward, up, down, and hover, the swooping, swirling flocks of European starlings that make finest choreography look amateurish, the stupendous migration of Arctic terns.
  But this is no dry lecture. My husband and I watched this with our teenaged daughter, one of our sons, and four of his children. From 60 to 4 years of age, we found it beautiful and incredible. The cinematography is excellent, comparable to anything done by National Geographic. The little ones liked to identify the birds. Grandparents and eight year old frequently said, ""I didn't know that.""
  As my husband said, the photography of the development of the chick within the egg alone was worth the price of the video!
  I really appreciated the attitudes of the biologists who seemed almost as much in awe and enjoyment of their subjects of expertise as I was.
  For my own purposes as a homeschooler,  I would not have minded a little more discussion of the design of birds during the video, but I think the target audience was those who have been told that evolution is true, have fallen for it, and have not seen any of the evidence that brings evolutionary teaching into doubt. The scientists leave most of the application of design's implications to the end. Even then, they do not do a hard sell. This is a tool I would feel very comfortable showing to nonChristian family members as well as using it to build the faith of my family. Everyone should see it. So very little is awe-inspiring nowadays, but this video is one of those few awe-inspiring presentations. My thirteen year old who dislikes essay writing was so delighted by it that she hopes to write an essay about it.",1388361600,,2148,4.799457994579946

Living in the North West, many of these birds have been my neighbours and I have wondered at them, but only in passing as they fly past.  Seeing them up close as they fly makes me awestruck.  Hearing the explanations of how they can do as they do.....i.e. humming birds hovering etc. makes me realize the mysteries of something small and so wonderously made not by happenstance, but by purpose.

5712452,5,B00CBLP2T0,"Our family watched ""Flight: The Genius of Birds"" last weekend and it was well worth the 60 minutes of our time. Illustra Media has produced an easy to follow film that highlights the complex engineering and design necessary for the avian world to master controlled flight.

It all begins in the DNA of a bird egg--which contains information from a  single  cell that directs formation of our magnificent bird world. As quoted in the hummingbird section of the video, to see this bird hover and maneuver is ""almost like responding to the work of an artist,""--and I would have to add, yes, ""a Master Artist.""

Illustra Media provides a number of salient quotes in this production, that make one think deeply about our world. ""A bird in flight is a consummate blend of beauty and fundamental design. For each is a living work of art that embodies the highest levels of engineering. What is the cause that is sufficient to bring this about?"" This is a great question, for we see purpose and design in the avian world. Illustra adds: ""They're engineering marvels. They're works of art.""

The wonders of our created world are also explored in this United Church of God publication available for the Kindle free on Amazon, ""Is the Bible True?"" It's another good resource to have in you library:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Is-the-Bible-True/dp/B0073YFYF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Is the Bible True?</a>

No worries. My children (ages 15, 13, 11) sat mesmerized for the entire film. And so did their parents...

I am a scientist and also a teacher of science, and I have come to appreciate and value materials which not only teach profound scientific ideas, but also capture the imagination of youngsters and inspire their interest in science. ""Flight"" delivers.

And nothing inspires wonder and awe like Nature itself. Illustra obviously understands this, and once again has prepared a fabulous, truly remarkable, presentation.

In ""Metamorphosis,"" they broke the film into two distinct sections: first the science, then the ID argument. In ""Flight,"" they sprinkled the argument throughout. OK...it was a bit too obvious at times (my 13 yrs son noted it several times). I think I prefer the earlier approach; in the long run I think it is more persuasive. Let Nature itself do its work first without tainting it with the argument, then review the science when you make your case afterward.

As Thomas Jefferson put it, ""when we take a view of the Universe, in its parts general or particular, it is impossible for the human mind not to perceive and feel a conviction of design, consummate skill, and indefinite power in every atom of its composition.""

Ironically, one of the scientists in the film (Nelson) noted that language was incapable of describing the majesty and wonder of the flight we observe in birds. My point exactly.

In the end, it is not the argument that actually convinces people anyway: it is Nature itself. The argument then serves a more supporting apologetic role afterward.

Congratulations, Illustra!  I anxiously await your next installment.",1373932800,10,2095,5.583596214511041

Darwinism has no clue how to explain flight and other features unique to birds. It's ""just so"" story is far inferior intellectual than that of intelligent design. Here is an example.

1. A 747 is obviously designed. Not because we know where they are built, but because of their nature: complex and specified for flight.
2. Hummingbirds are far more complex than a 747 (or any humanly-made airplane) and are, of course, specified for flight (and complex feeding through their amazing tongue, etc.).
