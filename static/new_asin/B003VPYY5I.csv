One can reflect on the printed word a bit longer and find some extraordinary insight into this man. Though, one cannot see 'the carpet dance' in the book. Hunter's in Hollywood. Huh! Marc Almond mentions the same bar in his book ""In Search of the Pleasure Palace"" 2006.

4209865,5,B003VPYY5I,"Leslie Jordan: My Trip Down The Pink Carpet was wonderful reading, extremely fascinating and a dream come true. I advise others to read it.",1324857600,2,139,4.833333333333333
4209866,3,B003VPYY5I,"i'm not sure if it hits too close to home or it's just unfunny but there seemed to be little to sympathize with in this video, as for a gay that hangs out with straight men, he seems obsessed only with the gay ones and not ones that would reciprocate. I liked his encounters with fellow celebrities, invariably spiced with ""Mr"" or ""Miss"" in the southern way but they don't seem any deeper than a stranger might have with them, be they Boy George on a camel or Faye Dunaway in a limo in Paris. He seems lost in his world and it was good to share it for a while.",1319328000,,560,4.054054054054054

4209868,4,B003VPYY5I,"Leslie Jordan makes good comedy, there is no doubt about that.  He has been around for a while and has picked up a lot of wisdom and has observed a lot during his life so far.  His style is flamboyant of course and it can get a bit tedious, but all in all it is a good show.  If you do not like gay stand-up comedians, I would not suggest watching this.",1304726400,2,353,3.875
4209869,5,B003VPYY5I,I bought this for a friend as a birthday gift and she loved it.  She had to watch it in spurts in order to take a breather from laughing so much.,1296950400,5,145,3.6774193548387095
4209870,4,B003VPYY5I,"Leslie Jordan is probably best known for his role in the play, movie and TV series ""Sordid Lives,"" but he's been making the rounds in Hollywood for over 30 years. ""My Trip Down The Pink carpet"" is his one-man show where Jordan delivers anecdotal stories, jokes and zingers about his life. It's highly entertaining, funny, and towards the end, when Jordan goes into the details about his rehab and ongoing sobriety (and how he has found a way to give back), serious.

It's a great deal of fun to watch a man who tells the audience ""I fell out of my mother's womb and right into her high heels"" describe a life that is gay with a capital G, and makes no bones about it. Certainly, he is preaching to the choir here, but ""My Trip Down the Pink Carpet"" shows Jordan as a man who survived the Hollywood machine with his wit intact. The stories about Boy George, George Clooney and Marc Harmon are funny and some of his one liners are laugh out loud bulls-eyes. More to the point, the success of this self described ""I'm the gayest man I know"" is inspirational.",1293148800,7,1055,4.410256410256411

4209872,5,B003VPYY5I,"I have enjoyed watching Leslie Jordan for a long time on tv and in movies.  I thought he stole every scene he was in on 'Will and Grace'.  So when his first show ""Like a Dog on Linoleum' first played here in Atlanta, I couldn't wait to see it.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at any show in my life.  (Note to Leslie and Breaking Glass Productions- PLEASE put that show on DVD too!).  So when this show came to Atlanta, I knew it was going to be just as good, and I was right.  Now everyone can see it on DVD.  And it is well worth the price.  Leslie can take the most common of 'gay' experiences (being bullied, trying to go into your first gay bar) and make it so hilarious through the humiliation and fear it actually was.  Then he can turn around the describe his experience in a straight recovery group and really make you think.
Leslie is a truly gifted comedic talent, and I hope he is back on TV soon in a starring role.  As he says towards the end of the show, he is one of the 'fabulous' queers.  I think that is a perfect way to describe him.",1284681600,16,1064,4.019047619047619

If you don't get the self-loathing part, please read Susan Sontag's seminal essay ""On Camp.""  It's as archaic any other prejudice, like racism, for example.  This little homosexual showoff is no less reprehensible than any latter day KKK knucklehead.  Objectifying anybody on the basis of skin color, ethnicity, gender or affectional preference is never funnyat best it is pathetically ignorant. Trying to make a buck from bigotry with cheap shots and hackneyed clichs, like this small-statured wannabe entertainer's pea-brained schtick, was never o.k. among thoughtful people of conscience, and even among the less enlightened, was pass, if not social hari-kari, by about 1970.",1503705600,,830,5.4609375

Most of his stand up was awesome, I had tear coming out of my eyes, tears of laughter, he is amazingly funny. But then he interrupts his show at least three or five times so we can ""celebrate our gayness."" By the third times, I was not celebrating it, I was fast forwarding it.

Some of the Truths that Mr. Jordan has given the world in this performance are so deeply a part of gay men and women who grew up during the 50's, 60's, and 70's in the 'Bible Belt' of America that they can consume entire lives and, worse, the spirits of those living them.  I hold this magnificent tribute to life and love and (maybe more importantly) self acceptance and self love as a light that all gay people, young and old should see and hear and feel. This should be a part of every Gay, Lesbian, transsexual, trans-spiritual, bisexual , and most importantly STRAIGHT persons perception of the true self within all people. My inner self has been strengthened and has grown a little closer to the reality of life and love in this world. Why has it affected me in this way?  I have retreated into a self-defensive shell of inaction, non-communication, self-loathing and self hatred because of many of the things that Mr. Jordan speaks of. I honestly have hopes of returning to life, to looking for that love within and without that helps to make a complete human being; without fear, without hate, without shame. My thanks to Leslie Jordan for communicating these truths; I have hopes for the young growing up with pride, love and self-love with the hope that they never have to feel shame, hatred of themselves and others, fear of and for themselves and others.
