7473979,1,B016JB0J9K,"In 2017 a virus kills much of LA. Somehow the area is isolated without the virus getting out. A team is sent in to find a doctor who has a cure. However the cure is being sold to big Pharma by an individual within the government.

Plot was ill conceived. Acting was bad. Characters were made lame by dialogue. Soundtrack was made for TV quality. Bad editing.",1454889600,4,358,4.343283582089552

7474051,1,B016JB0J9K,"How do you give no stars? This was the worse movie, I think I have ever seen. The acting is beyond awful, the only one who could act was the dog.

7474057,3,B016JB0J9K,More of an European style drama than a straight up zombie film unfortunately hampered by uneven performances and a lot of jumping around.,1458604800,,137,5.0
7474058,1,B016JB0J9K,"Terrible stiff acting, unintelligible plot, cornball set pieces, poor grammar in setup, lamest screenplay possible, not even fun to watch how bad it is.  In one (husband) word: Cinebarf.",1458518400,,186,5.413793103448276

8736609,1,B016JB0J9K,"This movie was directed by an amateur (or a drunk). Producers were only interested in the money they could get out of. Dialogue was neither fresh or intelligent. Music was horrible sometimes inappropriate. Settings were from a desert to downtown LA, never mind the traffic or mix up of city or desert scenes. Don't waste your money on the video.",1535587200,,345,4.766666666666667
8736610,1,B016JB0J9K,"Horrible acting just terrible. So, fake right down to the military commander she is a horrible Actress. And everyone Else.

8736615,1,B016JB0J9K,"The worst.  The worst acting, dialogue, spfx (there was none), they didn't show any zombies other than a blur running across the screen.  Awful, awful.  Did I mention the worst acting ever?  Not even close to the ""quality"" of Quarantine 1 and 2.  I actually enjoyed the earlier Quarantine movies as well as the REC movies.  But this was definitely an ignominious ending for the series.  And I really wanted to like it!  <sigh>",1486512000,,426,4.662162162162162
8736616,5,B016JB0J9K,Scary,1474329600,,5,5.0
8736617,2,B016JB0J9K,"Not the worst zombie film on prime, but definitely in the bottom 20 percentile. Casting was just bizzare - an Asian woman as the commander of JSOC?  Who cares about reality when you can have diversity right? Asian women make up less the 2% of the officer's corps in the US Military and exactly NONE of the special operations command because - special ops is male only! But OK, not only do we have a woman running JSOC we have a corrupt woman who is trying to sell the zombie virus to Big Pharma. I cant understand why big pharma would WANT a zombie virus you know since zombies don't buy Viagra and Rogaine but whatever...  This is just ""full of tropes"" - crooked woman general who is like the asian cruella deville, steely eyed commando, asian film maker kid, 12 year old asian girl who looks 35, bumbling dufus, the ditzy girlfriend, a german scientist, and the evil escaped convict. Oh yeah and the bumbling govt agents who get pepper sprayed and evaded by a 12 year old.  Its like OK lets throw all the  overused cliches in a bag, and then pick them out at random.  Not good.",1470268800,4,1079,4.375
8736618,1,B016JB0J9K,Not worth the rental fee or the time watching it. Acting bad and filming is horrible. The ending is the worse.,1467504000,2,110,4.285714285714286
