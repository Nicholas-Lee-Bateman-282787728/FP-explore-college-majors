966915,4,6305119120,"It's unavoidable to learn something about Season 3 from reading any review, there are just some things that I can't help but give away when reviewing this item, so if you don't want to have anything given away, it's best to stop here.
Well, a mere 18 months after the rest of the world got the chance to buy the whole of the first half of Season 3 and 12 months after the entire 22 episodes of the season became available on video (but in a format that can't be played on regular players in the US), the US has been rewarded with a choice of 6 of these 22 episodes of which three in particular are standouts, namely Enemies, Earshot and Graduation Day Part 1. Unlike the rest of the world, US viewers don't have to sort through all 22 episodes of the season, they have 6 very good ones chosen for them here.
In this pack ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Vampire Chronicles"" are 6 of the episodes from Season 3 which in its entirety originally aired from September 29, 1998 to July 13, 1999 (except Earshot, which was deferred) and consisted of 22 episodes. However, in this pack these are selected episodes from numbers 14 to 22. For reference, the names of the episodes from this part of the season are as follows, the ones in this pack are in capital letters, while the others are not and are in brackets.
S3 ep 14 - BAD GIRLS/S3 ep 15 - CONSEQUENCES/(S3 ep 16 - Doppelgangland)/S3 ep 17 - ENEMIES/S3 ep 18 - EARSHOT/(S3 ep 19 - Choices)/(S3 ep 20 - The Prom)/S3 ep 21 - GRADUATION DAY PART 1/S3 ep 22 - GRADUATION DAY PART 2.
Bad Girls (Season 3 episode 14):
In the preceding episodes, you have to know that Faith (Eliza Dushku) is the new Slayer that replaced Kendra (Bianca Lawson) and has come to Sunnydale. You also need to know that the previously unseen Mayor of Sunnydale (who the mere mention of would terrify Principal Snyder) starts making an appearance in person (Harry Groener) and he's planning something big which is not good for our heroes. Over time, the different personalities of Faith and Buffy has become increasingly apparent by this point of the season. You need to know (but it quickly becomes obvious) that where Buffy is more reserved and cautious, Faith is much more extroverted and reckless. Faith finally talks Buffy into making some changes in her life to make it more exciting and it leads to a night of encounters that lurches from one disaster to the next with the inevitable tragedy at the end of it. Also heralds the arrival (after a false dawn or two) of a new watcher that makes Giles look like quite the party animal in comparison; the man we all loved to hate back then (but with good reason) - Wesley Wyndham-Price (Alexis Denisof - now a regular on the spin off ""Angel"" - and much more liked).
Consequences (Season 3 Episode 15):
This seems like an obvious title given what was written about the previous episode. A lot more downbeat in tone, the fallout of the previous episode is still raining from the skies; with Buffy being left holding the bag and looking like she's in a lot of trouble. The mayor plans to use this to his advantage and what results puts everyone in considerable danger in a showdown led by the Mayor's fixer Mr Trick (K. Todd Freeman).
Enemies (Season 3 Episode 17):
It is difficult to say much about this episode without giving crucial information away. Well, you need to know that in a crucial scene in the previous episode not included in this pack that Faith has now decided to switch sides and throw her lot in with the Mayor. He gives her the job of trying to bring Angel back across to the dark side in much the same way as he way taken there in Season 2 (episode 13 - Surprise). This is one of the best episodes of the season and after a particular event happens, you just wonder how the writers were going to get out of the corner they seemed to have written themselves into. Suffice to say that they manage brilliantly in a way that is not a cheat. Surprises abound in this one, with a particularly brilliant scene revealing one of them.
Earshot (Season 3 - Episode 18):
This episode takes a break from the main theme of the season, whatever the Mayor is planning and is a self-contained episode which ended up being more topical than it intended. After a fight with two demons in what has to be the most dangerous park in America, Buffy is accidentally contaminated with the blood of one of them. This unexpectedly gives her the power to read minds. This is a very funny episode where Buffy uses this power to her advantage in class, learns that Cordelia really is as superficial as she looks, Willow is even more neurotic as she looks and that being able to read Oz's mind makes him more cryptic and impenetrable, not less. As for Xander, well no surprises there - unfortunately for him as everyone has their suspicions confirmed.
Not surprisingly, there's a downside. The thoughts of many of her classmates are particularly grim (understandable in Sunnydale) and it culminates in the discovery that someone is planning a massacre at the school. Unfortunately, finding this out in the crowded school cafeteria means there's a number of suspects. It's a race against time on two fronts, to intercept the would be assassin and find a way to shut off Buffy's steadily growing mind-reading power as it threatens to drown her in noise she can't shut off and drive her insane as a result.  There are numerous twists in this episode (especially the one where it finally becomes clear what's going on - a very funny scene) and it concludes with one of the funniest final scenes in an episode, ever, as past (albeit unintentional) misdemeanours from a previous episode come to light. Unfortunately, the episode in which said event occurred in not available (in the US), so if you haven't seen it, it may a) kill the joke and b) leave you scratching your head and asking yourself ""when did THAT happen?"". (Clue - it helps to have seen ""Band Candy"" (S3 ep6) if you have the means to do so).
Understandably, was pulled from screening because of the Columbine school shootings given the subject matter was just too close and was not actually shown in the US for the first time until September 21, 1999.
Graduation Day Parts 1 & 2 (Season 3, episode 21 and 22):
Well, everything comes to a head in these two episodes. The Mayor is holding all the cards and whatever he has planned is clearly going to collide with the Graduation of Sunnydale's class of 1999 - as he's the guest speaker. Part 1 is an excellent episode which culminates in Buffy settling scores with Faith in what is probably the best fight scene in the show to date. All credit must go to Jeff Pruitt (Stunt Co-ordinator), Sophia Crawford (Buffy stunt double), Karen Shepard (Faith stunt double) and the rest of the people involved in this extended fight sequence (I'm sorry I don't know all your names) which can take days to film and the stunt players can accumulate a lot of injuries in the process. The standard has always been high but they really outdo themselves here. Part 2 finally reveals exactly what the mayor was up to and things appropriately culminate in an appropriately big melee and an unmissable explosive climax.
Part 2 was postponed because of what happened in Columbine until July 13, 1999 in the US.
Well, in general it might seem strange that this pack starts at episode 14 but in this season, the Mayor's plans really only became apparent around this time, the preceding half of the season dealing more with Buffy's return to Sunnydale after the end of last season and rebuilding her life and relationships. Overall, most of the key events are covered in the main theme of this season, much in the same way that the main theme of season 2 did not become apparent until around the middle of the season as well. You get some very good episodes, all of which are very exciting and worth seeing. Admittedly, however there are going to be some moments which don't make sense as it requires information from previous episodes and in between that are not available at the moment. Also, unfortunately, as good as these episodes are and the obvious choices for release as they deal with the main theme of the Mayor, Season 3 is in the curious position of having most of its very best episodes having little or nothing to do with it but being effectively stand-alones ousted the main theme in their own right (namely numbers 1,8,9,12,13 and 16). If you want to find out the sum totality of all episodes for the show in all seasons and their order, there are a number of good websites with episode lists which any good search engine should find. The official site is a good place to start, look in ""The Mortuary"" where the old episode descriptions are ""buried"". Easy enough to find, simply in the world-wide web, the first name of the lead character, a dot and a com.
Just for reference, those episodes in Season 3 to watch out for should they be released in future are: Anne (S3 ep1), Lover's Walk (S3 ep8), The Wish (S3 ep9), Helpless (S3 ep12) The Zeppo (S3 ep13). Doppelgangland (S3 ep16) is my personal favourite of all seasons so far. If you're inte",976233600,55,9099,4.541412911084044
966916,5,6305119120,"For this collection of a half-dozen episodes from the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon has decided to focus on the story arc combining the Faith the Rogue Slayer and Mayor's Ascension plot lines.  In providing six of last nine episodes from that year's Buffy, The Slayer Chronicles includes both of the episodes that the WB delayed airing after the tragedy at Columbine High School.
The first volume starts the with ""Bad Girls,"" scripted by Douglas Petrie, in which the Mayor's minions are seeking an amulet of invincibility while Faith's attitude about slaying rubs off on Buffy.  After a night of dancing together at the Bronze (an all-time Buffy highlight) the two Slayers are caught in a robbery and Faith stakes a mortal, Deputy Mayor Finch, thinking he was a vamp.  The episode ends with a chilling scene in which Buffy confronts Faith for having killed a living being only to have the unrepentant Slayer declare, ""I don't care.""  In ""Consequences,"" written by the prolific Marti Noxon, the Mayor sends the police after the Slayer killed his assistant.  Faith continues her blind run towards the edge, blaming Buffy for what happened, attacking Xander and eventually joining the Mayor.  Whether you know the outcome of the tale or not, either way Eliza Dushku's portrait of Faith's descent into psychosis is gripping.  Buffy and the Scooby Gang are just along for the ride at this point.
The second volume offers ""Enemies,"" written by Douglas Petrie, in which the Mayor arranges to steal Angel's soul as a way of distracting Buffy.  The plan appears to work, especially when Angelus takes a liking to Faith and the pair begins torturing a captured Buffy.  ""Earshot,"" by Jane Esperson, was the infamous episode that the WB decided not to air the day after the Columbine tragedy.  The plot has to do with Buffy killing a demon and ending up with the power to read minds.  Before all the voices start to drive her insane she hears someone planning to kill everybody at Sunnydale High.  However, the reason the network was nervous about the episode, which Sarah Michelle Gellar picked as one of her favorites because of what it says about surviving the horrors of high school, was Xander's off handed comment about sometimes thinking about opening up on the school with a gun.
The two-part ""Graduation Day"" season conclusion written and directed by Josh Whedon provides the final volume in The Slayer Chronicles.  Part 1 has Faith shooting Angel with a poisoned arrow.  The only cure is the blood of a Slayer, which sends Buffy after Faith for a fatal duel to the death.  Part 2 finds Buffy having to deal with the consequences of her battle with Faith and the Mayor's Ascension, when he will turn into a 60-foot demon serpent.  Also on the agenda is graduating high school, if only Buffy, the Scooby Gang and the rest of their class can survive the ceremony.  The final note of fun is that after the dust settles, Angel will be leaving Sunnydale for good. After ending the second season of Buffy with the two-parts of ""Becoming,"" wherein the series reached its absolute height, it is still impressive to see what Whedon was able to come up with for season three.  The idea of Faith as a Rogue Slayer was a good one all by itself, but putting it together with the Mayor's quest for eternal power was a masterstroke.  We should stop being surprised by such things from Whedon, but we should not stop being appreciative of his efforts.  The man does quality work.  As always, you have to wish there was more commentary from Whedon on the story behind the episodes.
After the failure of the initial Buffy video tape set to provide the resolution to the Master storyline from the first season, it is certainly gratifying that Joss Whedon has provided complete story arcs with both last year's The Buffy & Angel Chronicles and The Slayer Chronicles.  Still, it would have been nice if one of Marti Noxon's Vamp Willow Episodes, ""The Wish"" or ""Doppelgangland,"" had been included.  But even though ""Earshot"" is not important to the Faith/Mayor story arc, it deserves to be included because of its status as a footnote to what happened at Columbine.  Perhaps Whedon could produce a series of video tapes each having a couple of episodes focusing on Willow, Xander, Giles, etc., just like the Buffy novelization books. Just an idea of something to tide us over until the rest of Buffy is released on DVD, Joss (hint, hint, hint).",973468800,103,4443,4.777777777777778

The introduction of the Annointed One in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" is the first hint that this series will be more  than Good Buffy vs. Evil Master every week.

There are 3 tapes (six episodes in total) from the 3rd season.  The price of these tapes is a little pricy, but it's totally worth it.  It starts out with Buffy and Faith slaying vampires, and Buffy is starting to act more and more like bad girl Faith.  But then by accident Faith murders an innocent man, and it changes her life forever.  The rest of the episodes are mostly about Buffy and the gang trying to help Faith.  In one episode called ""Earshot"", buffy gains the power to read everyone's mind.  Xandar's mind is halarious (you'll find out why if you buy these tapes) and Cordelia can't think of anyone but herself!  These tapes end with Graduation parts 1&2... what happens is Willow loses her virginity to Oz, Faith shoots Angel near the heart by a poison arrow and Angel nearly dies (the only cure is slayer's blood) and so Buffy forces Angel to drink herself!!  That was one of the best parts of these tapes if you ask me.  The rest that happens is buffy and the rest of the graduates at sunnydale high have to fight the mayor.  These tapes are so good and well written.  The action keeps flowing and you'll find yourself never bored while watching!  I think the third and second seasons were the best seasons of buffy, and you should also buy the Buffy & Angel Chronicles Gift set available at amazon as well!",988070400,8,1463,4.41044776119403

967024,4,6305119120,"You'll generally find two schools of thought among ""Buffy"" fans. On one side, there are the vast number of people who began watching in the show's first few seasons. Most were hooked by the Buffy-Angel romance and continued to watch largely for that reason. For them, that romance is the undying heart of the series. They use words like ""destiny"" and ""golden age"" when waxing poetic about Buffy and Angel, and they're very resistant to any sort change. Anything that's not the second season (see ""golden age""), doesn't end in tears and whispers between said duo, or strays from the established formula is somehow flawed.
Then there are the people who are relatively new to the show, who come into it with an open mind - despite the tongue-in-cheek title - and learn to love the show for what it is: well-paced ensemble acting, great writing, and strong dialogue.
If you're one of the latter, this box set will certainly appeal to you. Although Mr. Tall, Dark, and Somber is still a brooding presence in these episodes, they are a great example of the direction the show took after David Boreanaz (Angel) left for his own series. There's a maturity and depth here - particularly in Eliza Dushku's brilliantly written and wonderfully portrayed ""fallen slayer"" Faith - that was nowhere to be found in the show's earlier seasons. Likewise, although Buffy is still the show's centerpiece, other characters are far more interesting (and funny). That's a trend which has continued.
There's still the occassional man-in-a-rubber-suit monster that was the hallmark of the earlier seasons, but for the most part this is where Buffy grows up; the character and, more importantly, the show. No, you won't find season 2 here. What you'll find - from Faith's layered complexity, to the exploration of gray moralities, to the symbolism of facing change - is simply some of the best writing on TV.",980467200,10,1881,4.899686520376176

The set includes the episodes, ""Earshot"" and the 2 part ""Graduation Day"", which were both delayed by the WB initially in reaction to the Columbine school shootings.  As always, solid writing, acting, and a wicked sense of humor are evident in this series.

967026,4,6305119120,"i watched these videos and thought they were top rate. i have  always liked  faith. she brings a refreshing change of pace to buffy the vampire slayer. in the first video, buffy and faith must deal with the new watcher that the watcher's council has sent to replace giles. they automatically think he is a dork and go out on a rebellion spree.  this episode not only shows them getting arrested, but the next night one of them kills someone. won't let the cat out of the bag by saying who. in the second episode deals with the repurcussions of their actions as the police question both of them and find out that  faith actually did it. the ending of this episode was a nice  and very unexpected twist when faith goes over to the mayor's side. tape number 3 starts weith the mayor and faith trying to figure out a way to take angel's soul from him again. i will not get into greater deph because that will spoil a very good episode.  suffice it to say that they succeed and see all the consequences.
in the second half of the tape, buffy gains the power to read minds after fighting a demon. this is really good when she starts to find out exactly what people around her are thinking. it has a lot of humor and i think it was well written. this was also the  episode that the wb pulled after the columbine shooting so this  should definitely be a must see for anyone who has not seen it.
the third and final tape deals is the season finale for season 3 and brings to a conclusion the fight with the mayor and faith. the duo decide they want to get buffy busy and distracted so faith shoots angel with a poisonious arrow.  the scooby gang find that the only cure for this is for angel to drain the blood of a  slayer. about hearing this, buffy thinks it is the perfect solution to go and bring faith to angel to cure him since she was the one that poisoned him in the first place. this episode goes on to show the mayor's acension at graduation day and how the gang deals with this problem. this is a very good tape to have. i highly reccommend getting the gift pack but if you can only  afford one this last is definitley the best.",979257600,,2130,4.221674876847291

7883090,4,6305119120,"I just watched the permanent return of Amy Madison from rat status during the sixth season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and wanted to look back at our first meeting with the young witch of Sunnydale High School.  This tape is the second of the three that make up the first season collection of ""BtVS,"" and it was the weakest tape in the set because it includes a pair of episodes that are only tangentially important to the developing Buffy mythos.
When we first meet Amy in ""The Witch"" she is just another girl trying out for the Sunnydale High Cheerleading squad along with Buffy and Cordelia. This is one of those early episodes that acknowledges the original feature film as background for the series by having Buffy show up in a cheerleading costume. Of course this is Sunnydale, so we are not surprised when one of the girls spontaneously bursts into flames during the tryouts. Eventually our attention is drawn to Amy, who is pretty uncoordinated but whose mother really, really, REALLY wants her to be on the squad. Every time something bad happens to another one of the girls, Buffy and Amy move up the ladder of cheerleading success. ""The Witch"" is--surprise, surprise--the episode that introduces the occult into the Buffy universe, which has major implications for Willow down the road. Written by Dana Reston, it is clearly the stronger of the two episodes on this particular tape.
""Never Kill A Boy On The First Date"" does have a marvelous moment where Buffy goes after the bad guy screaming, ""You killed my date!"" Remember the sub-text for Buffy is that High School is Hell for children, so here we have Buffy trying to at least pretend she is a normal student and actually go out on a normal date. Just wait until Owen finds out what ""normal"" means in the wonderful and wacky world of Buffy. The Master's attempt to use ""the Anointed One"" to kill the Slayer is the major sub-plot in this episode, which is far and away the weakest of the six included in this boxed set.  Of course, now that we have all but the final season of ""BtVS"" available on DVD there is no real reason to pick this up because if you want to enjoy these episodes in Spanish you can do that with the DVD set, which is one of the most reasonably priced complete seasons of a television series available.",1086048000,,2290,4.582926829268293

7883093,5,6305119120,"Season three although a weaker story when contrasting to the sensationally unpredictable and heart-wrenching second season it is still far better then your average television show.  In this box-set you will start off with the episodes, ""Bad Girls""
""Bad Girls"" explores the beginings of a slayers corruption.  At first Buffy tags along with Faith on there extra-long patrolings and excessive partying.  Soon it goes from not-so-innocent fun to criminal actions where they rob a weapons store.  They are caught, but the ""Deeply Stupid"" police-men are easily escaped from. (doesn't that sentance sound wonderful)  Anyway, we get to see a ugly fat demon ""Balthazar"", and the killing of the Deputy Mayor.  This is an exciting and necessary volume for any Buffy fan, and seeing that we won't be getting the DVD's until winter 2003 it might not be the worst idea to purchase these gems.
Well next up we have ""Consequenses"".  Everyone is trying to help Faith along.  Eventually the truth is revealed and just as Angel is about to get Faith to open up all goes to hell as Wesley (introduced in ""Bad Girls"") steals Faith away.  In the confusion of betrayl and lack-of-feeling Faith goes to the mayor for a job opening after killing the hilarious and devious Mr. Trick.
Well in volume two we have ""Enemies"" and ""Earshot"".  It's a large plot twist and like last season Buffy is betrayed...by Faith.  In ""Enemies"" Angel pretends to turn evil.  He uses, or ""Plays"" Faith for information.  This event leaves some open wounds for Buffy and Angel and Faith is confirmed as an enemy.  Earshot is a one-shot.  It's one of my favorite episodes, but not necessary for the plot.  Pretty much Buffy and Angel reconcile. (They aren't going out, they are...they aren't they are...whatever.)
Alright the finale episodes, ""Graduation"".  These prove to be two of the best hours of television in Buffy history.  Although not quite what ""Becoming"" was you will be too entrapped with the story  to be thinking about last year.  Heres what happens.
1) Faith is nearly killed by Buffy to save Angel's life
2) Angel is gone by the end of the episodes
3) Willow loses her virginity to Oz
4) Cordelia and Wesley come to terms with there relationship
5) The mayor ascends at graduation
6) Buffy quits the 'Watchers Council'
7) The school bands together to fight the Mayor
8) Three recuring characters die. (I'm to lazy to tell)
9) The school is blown up.
10)The day is saved.

7883094,5,6305119120,"The fever-pitch melodrama begun with Buffy's second season climax reached its peak in these third season episodes.  The show was at its all-time best with the pairing of fallen Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) and her ersatz adopted daddy, the twisted Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener).
The dynamic of the two characters is unique, and spellbinding.  Faith is a girl whose superior abilities can't save her from her own human frailties and jealousies, and the Mayor is a squeaky-clean fascist nerd politician, who directs his vampire and demon minions to murder the masses while in the same breath admonishing them not to swear.  The Mayor, oddly enough, genuinely loves Faith, as he would his own daughter  -  knowing full well that she is a violent psychopath, and fully exploiting the fact to their mutual advantage.  Watching the two together has, simultaneously, the dark humor of an Addams Family episode and the fascination of an unpreventable train wreck.  They make your skin crawl, and yet actually tug at your heartstrings in the very real love  -  however unholy it might be  -  they share for each other.
Faith's interaction with Buffy is equally compelling, each being the mirror image of the other.  Buffy is the ""favored sister,"" the beautiful blonde with all the advantages, and the dark, sensual Faith's jealousy at perceiving herself always on the outside of everyone's affections ultimately sends her into a fatal tailspin of murder, madness and betrayal.  She wants to be like Buffy, but lacks the character and inner spirit  -  so she ends up trying to destroy her, instead.  The climactic battle between the two, is  -  along with Buffy's second season duel to the death with Angelus  -  the most dramatic of the entire series.
While the entire cast is, as usual, witty, charming and loveable, this set is really a showcase for the talents of Dushku and Groener  -  playing the best pair of villains the series ever had to offer, and one of the most perversely fantastic odd couples ever to delight an audience.",1020902400,,2030,4.891495601173021
7883095,4,6305119120,"I was probably one of the fortunate few who caught Buffy from the start although at the time I laughed my butt off when I realized they had ACTUALLY made a tv show out of the movie. It intrigued me though because as I was flipping channels on a boring night of baby-sitting I saw a girl fighting with a guy and actually seeming to win until he flipped her into a coffin (first episode of the first season). This was back when girl power had barely any influence  so I made a note of the time and channel, watched the second episode and was hooked. The second season was definitely the pinnacle of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" because of how much it grew. From the very first episode when Sarah Michelle Gellar danced sexily you know things were going to be very different in Sunny Dale. I'm not a big romance fan so even I was amazed at how much I got sucked into the Buffy-Angel saga, although I couldn't help it because it was so engaging and REAL. That's what I loved about Buffy in the first few seasons, every episode had a moral without being too after-school-special-ish. Granted not everyone has had their boyfriend turn into a murdering monster after sleeping with them, but many have had said boyfriend change drastically after taking such a huge leap. The third season was good for me, but not great. It definitely had some awesome episodes which were tragically left out of this set. I dub the second season as the best, the first season as second best just because it was more up-beat and fun than the third. I found a lot of the third season episodes very boring and morose; where-as this worked in the second season, most often in the third it was very yawn-inducing. ""Band Candy"", ""The Wish"", and ""Doppelgangland"" were some of my favorite episodes so I was sad when they were left out. ""Bad Girls"" is worthy of watching just for the ""this is your wake-up call boys"" and dancing scene, but ""Consequences"" is very droll. ""Enemies"" is blah after one viewing, things pick up with ""Earshot"", and I wasn't a big fan of ""The Graduation"" episodes although they needed to be included to complete the Buffy-Faith Chronicles. I'm one of those waxing poetic people who think Buffy and Angel deserve to be together, but in the third episode things got a little too over the top with the drama. I think this was proved best in the episode ""The Zeppo"" (one of the worst Buffy episodes) where Buffy and Angel are arguing passionately about something or other with that lovey dovey mood music in the background which is stopped when Xander shows up. Hoping I wasn't the only one who found that comedic:) All in all, it was a pretty good season but not the best, and after season 4 the show just lost it's appeal for me. It got too campy and Sarah Michelle Gellar's nose started to really bother me LOL Superficial, I know, but she's supposed to be all pretty and then there's this crooked nose.",1017705600,,2891,4.496197718631179
7883096,5,6305119120,"These episodes are from Buffy's superb third season. Well, every season is superb. This season introduced rogue slayer Faith(played by sexy Eliza Dushku). It's obvious from the get go that Faith is the opposite of Buffy. She's wild, outrageous, sexual, and dangerous. But things go from bad to worse in the six episodes on this tape. ""Bad Girls"" finds Buffy giving in to Faith's wild lifestyle and enjoying it, until something horrible happens in the end. It follows up in ""Consequences"", where Buffy is racked with guilt over what happened. She is horrified to see that Faith doesn't care. Even more shocking is when she crosses over to the dark side to becomes the right hand man for the season's villain, who was the Mayor Of Sunnydale. ""Enemies"" deals with Buffy and Angel trying to use Faith to uncover the Mayor's master plan. ""Earshot"" is a very touchy subject about school violence. It was a brilliantly crafted storyline on a tough subject. The last tape is ""Graduation Day Parts 1 & 2"". It was the big season finale. It's an explosive two part episode. This was a great season for Buffy. Sharp, witty, intelligent writing, acting, and direction. The show keeps getting better and better. It's a shame to the profession that Joss Whedon has not won an emmy for this. These are essential episodes and a box set not to be missed. ... Buy this and enjoy.",1004313600,7,1360,4.718487394957983

7883098,5,6305119120,"What an amazing cast, what an amazing concept, and what an amazing season. This is by far the best of the Buffy Chronicles. Included are the episodes featuring Faith, played by the sultry Eliza Dushka. The episodes are intriguing, exciting, and dramatic. Sarah Michelle Gellar is so wonderful, especially in the episode Ear Shot where she thinks someone is going to go on a murdering spree. This is by far the best episode of the bunch. Also amazing is Graduation part 2 where Buffy again saves the world. The ending is thrilling, as well as the scene where Buffy forces Angel to drink her blood to cure him. I cannot say enough how wondeful the writing is. It is passionate and witty, and the cast  handles it flawlessly. Alyson Flanigan is wonderful in the role of Willow, as well Seth Green as Oz. Charisma Carpenter is hystrerical as Cordelia. I recommend this collection very highly. It is truly one of the most entertaining and well written shows on television today, and sarah Michelle Gellar is one of the best actresses on tv.
