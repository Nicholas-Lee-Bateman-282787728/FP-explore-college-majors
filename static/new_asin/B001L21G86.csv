8316925,5,B001L21G86,Ms. Mercury  throws it down with this CD and associated DVD.  Wow!!  This work of hers is extremely energetic and gripping and also at times soothing.,1322092800,,150,4.6923076923076925
8316926,4,B001L21G86,"Great music and great show (5 stars). Drawback from the video is the way it has been cut and put together. The video clip style misses most of the great show and dancing. After all this is the reason why you're watching a dvd and not listening to a cd. It is nice to view from a video point of view, but not so much if you want to enjoy the bale.",1263945600,,346,3.8194444444444446
8316927,5,B001L21G86,"The great singer from Salvador, Bahia continues to grow and mature. Bale Mulato Ao Vivo is her greatest live document yet. The songs are super-catchy, the arrangements are hot, the band is incredible, and Daniela is at the top of her considerable powers. I saw this band doing material from this album recently at the Brazil On The Beach festival in Hollywood, FL, and it was an amazing 3-hour concert experience I will never forget. This DVD is as close as possible to seeing this visionary artist live. Just get ready to dance, as she continues to make some of the most irresistible music on the planet. Highly recommended!",1238716800,2,625,4.743119266055046
