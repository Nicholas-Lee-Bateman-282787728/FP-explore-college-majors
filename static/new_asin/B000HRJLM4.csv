Have viewing parties and whatever else it takes to get the messege out.  I have been researching this topic for over 5 years now and this is always new things to learn.  This dvd points out clear cut cases of false flag terrorism.  IT IS NOT SOME THERORY ABOUT STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM! Terrorism is real and people in the middle east are clearly not only being funded, but hey are also used to create distractions for a more global objective.  GREAT MOVIE ALEX AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! REMEMBER..............................

""Of course the people do not want war. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy.

2639907,3,B000HRJLM4,"Jones makes some very worthwhile points, not the least of which is that terror is as much a matter of perspective as definition, especially in light of some of the U.S. government's actions that could be accurately and fairly labeled as ""terrorism"" (which Jones does a decent job of summarizing).

Here, Jones doesn't quibble with the fact that 9/11 was an act of terrorism, but with who the guilty parties are.  The numerous discrepancies presented (along with many that are not), are certainly worthy of further scrutiny.  And it is amazing (inexcusable and probably criminal, actually) that more media investigative attention has not be given to such a major event and the litany of unanswered questions associated with it.

I disagree with Jones' condemnation of government as the evil responsible for 9/11.  Rather, the focus should be on the individual criminals responsible, instead of the institution they exploited, or circumvented, or victimized, to perpetrate their crime.",1214265600,8,983,5.2756410256410255

I've been looking for a documentary without a left or a right tilt, something that is objective. I found this movie to be beyond moronic, and I therefore do not recommend wasting your money on this movie.
The movie stars a bunch of idiots starting with Code Pink mega-loons - Cindy Sheehan, who collects money and sends it to the Iraqi terrorists (Google it). This movie also has a bunch of idiots who believe that 9/11 was an inside job and so were the London - 7/7 attacks. The movie also stars idiots like Ray McGovern (Retired CIA analyst) along with Charlie Sheen.

He opens the documentry detailing many ""false flag"" terror operations the US and other Western goverments have carried out, not conspiracy theories, but declassified operations that have been openly admitted do.  Mostly events that happened back in the 50's and 60's.

Then he unviels a host of damning facts about 7/7(the British railway bombings, and other ""anti-terrorist"" actions of the British government, including interviewing to whistle-blowing former MI6 members and top members of the British goverment..  Believe me, you WILL be floored.

He also hits the streets Michael Moore style and interviews common people on these issues, very interesting.  It's also filled with a hoards of other great info, too much to get into, and interviews, one of my favorites being with Ray McGovern, former CIA Analyst.

Alex belives there is a group working towards the total enslavement of the human population, and even if that idea seems too extreme to you, there are many facts in this film that will change the way you view our goverment forever.",1185408000,8,1230,5.054455445544554

""TerrorStorm"" is one of his best... Alex actually eases off of his typical ""excitment"" and does a good job of presenting factual information without offputting the viewer.  His other works could be unpalatable to the average viewer and golden to his hardcore fans.

2639934,4,B000HRJLM4,"I have watched this three times now.  Each time I watch it I am more convinced of our politician's duplicity and ruthlessness.  The film is particularly good on the history of false flag terrorism, and we are never left in any doubt as to the identity of the main perpetrators. But, regarding the claims made about September 11th and July 7th, after each viewing I find myself saying, ""Hang on a minute.""

Some of the claims and accusations made here are just not proven.  There are most definitely massive holes in the official stories, and the film is worth watching, open mouthed, as the accepted version is torn apart.  However, the fact that our governments are lying does not make the sensational claims made here true. Neither does the music added for dramatic effect or the presence of Charlie Sheen (for God's sake) as a supporter of filmmaker, Alex Jones.

Something very nasty (and hard to believe) has certainly taken place. I'm sure of that from various sources.  But this film is trying too hard to sell itself, rather than actually proving beyond doubt some its more serious charges. I also mistrust (perhaps unfairly) Alex Jones, who seems to be selling himself every bit as much as his message.

I certainly recommend Terrorstorm to anyone with an open and curious mind. There is much to applaud and much to be learnt, but the film has yet to be made, or the book written that actually proves the hypotheses that so many are proclaiming as truths with such blithe certainty.",1178668800,8,1491,4.72972972972973

2639936,4,B000HRJLM4,"I am skeptical of the ""9/11 Inside Job"" theory.  Although, I'm sure the weapons industry rejoiced when it happened, and some of our masters of war may have helped the project along (the training & funding the CIA and others have provided militants, letting the attack unfold, etc.).  The towers don't appear to fall due to planted explosions to me.  They seem to be imploding from where the planes slammed into them.

Anyway, I'm sure many of you have heard the ""Popular Mechanics"" people who ""debunk"" the inside job theory.  While many disregard their analysis, I think they make some solid points.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Debunking-9-11-Myths-Why-Conspiracy-Theories-Can-t-Stand-Up-to-the-Facts/dp/158816635X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Facts</a>

Additionally, I'm concerned by the way some of the people who believe the inside job theory attack those who don't subscribe to it and/or dismiss progressive media that spend their time on other important issues (of which there are many).  Nevertheless, I appreciated the history that ""Terrorstorm"" provides, and the way it covers the way we're being diverted by things like pro sports.  I liked how ""Terrorstorm"" gave a lot of time to Cindy Sheehan and Ray McGovern.  Also, it was also great to see this film bring up the work of Edward Bernays, a founder of the PR profession who influenced the work of Josef Geobbels.

Noam Chomsky has been writing about Bernays for decades, so it's kind of ironic and counter-productive for ""Inside Job"" people to slam Chomsky for not agreeing that the government committed the 9/11 attacks, or that a missile hit the Pentagon.  We shouldn't let disagreements on some issues, no matter how important, divide people who share the same sorts of concerns about freedom.

I don't understand the emphasis on building 7.  I don't see how the destruction of that building would help accomplish the neocon agenda.  People are hardly even aware of that building's collapse, so how could it be that its destruction was part of a plan to manipulate the general public for war?  It seems to make sense that the building would've been ""pulled,"" since there was so much damage to it.

And it also makes sense that there are, and will always be, unanswered questions and contradictions regarding this hideous blowback.

Regarding the neoconservative agenda, I agree it is ugly and awful.

Although, people like William Blum suggest that it isn't very new.  He documents how the empire's agenda has been to conquer the world for quite some time - whether ""liberals"" or ""neocons"" are in charge.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killing-Hope-U-S-Military-and-CIA-Interventions-Since-World-War-II-Updated-Through-2003/dp/1567512526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II-Updated Through 2003</a>&nbsp;Moreover, there is another agenda that Alex Jones and others need to start talking about, and that is the agenda of ""neoliberalism.""

Lyndon Johnson's perfidy regarding the Israeli attack on the U.S.S. Liberty, the mathematically impossible odds and coincidences surrounding the London tube bombings, the CIA's mulitude of ""false flag"" operations commencing with the shamefully engineered installation of the Shah in Iran (which has resulted in a numbing cascade of negative impacts for our nation right up to the present day's insanity of another looming pre-emptive attack) and, of course, the multitude of unanswered and, worse, unasked questions haunting our understanding of 9/11, has had a chilling effect on my trust in government to fulfill its constitutional role to honestly represent us and perform a constructive role in an increasingly imperiled world.  Alex Jones deserves plaudits for pulling our heads out of the sand, flushing our myoptic eyes with fresh water and asking us to see the horror so that our ignorance will not permit or create even worse sequels.

In my opinion, however, the film attempts to cover what seems like almost too much material; I would recommend focusing on one specific event, as is more typical of AJ's efforts and InfoWars' productions.  The sheer scope of events that the film presents is almost confusing at times, and I feel it might upset the attention span of most ""uninformed"" individuals.

Aside from this film, there are stockpiles of evidence to support its claims if you just make the effort to look.  The conspiracies are well planned, and the cover-up and aversion techniques are well executed. While public is distracted with War, War, War, revenge, ""justice"", Al-Queda, Britney Spears, gas prices, political smearing, and the like, the government is busy giving us all the shaft.

But I do know there is a dark side to American government.  I just didn't know it was so widespread with the U.S. and with her allies.

This documentary is kind of annoying to watch because Alex Jones tries so hard to cram his theory down the viewer's throat.  Rude people are a turn-off!  On the other hand, American potential for creating terrorism is something to think about.

I am wondering: if what the film is saying about America becoming Fascist and engaging in censorship is true, how is it that he can make and distribute a DVD exposing it?  And since he has done this, how is it that he has not died from a convenient accident or a mysterious illness?

This documentary does give the viewer much to think about.

2639954,5,B000HRJLM4,"This film is likely the best film out there revealing the truth behind government sponsored terrorism. There is only one thing I can say. See this film. You will never be the same again. Prepare yourself for the truth about what is going on in this world today. How many world citizens know that most of the so called ""terror attacks"" are not done by ""terrorists"" but by leaders of world government.

Ignore this film at your own peril. The information it presents is shocking, nightmarish, and deeply disturbing. Do not see this film if you want to wake up tomorrow and have everything be the same as it always is in ""happyville, USA"" because that won't happen. This is not just a film, it is a call to action, a wake-up call to the sheople of the world, particularly the sheople of America.

The Madrid bombings, Oklahoma City, The London bombings, 9/11 and countless other horrific events were in fact deceptive orchestrated events compliments of our own governments, particularly those of the US and England. It has been going on for years and the majority of the lemmings know nothing about this.

As cliche as it sounds, always remember, Paul Revere was ridiculed for proclaiming the coming of the British but they came nonetheless. i urge everyone to see this film and heed Mr. Jones's warning because this film is nothing but a warning, a plea for humanity to wake up before it is too late. but i'm afraid it is already to late. Congratulations to the filmmakers and to Alex Jones for his great courage and endless effort to pursue the truth about the great evil which pervades the earth under its current controllers.

Instead, I challenge you to look into why Trade Center Building 7 collapsed.  It's well documented from major respected news sources.  Where you go from there is up to you, but I can't believe that you could come away from that investigation still believing the results of the 911 commission.  The current administration used 911 as a motivation to go to war.  The American people deserve complete answers to the unanswered questions of 911.

2639961,5,B000HRJLM4,"Fear of terrorism is the driving force behind the curtailment of liberty and the pretext for pre-emptive wars. But who is really behind recent terror attacks? Alex Jones is an outspoken critic of the US and British oligarchy and he concludes that 9/11 and the 7/7 London bombings were inside jobs.

Alex Jones starts off by providing proof of concept of false flag terrorism. Western governments have been shown to have been involved in terrorism and staged events in the past - Hitler's Reichstag fire, Operation Ajax in Iran, Operation Northwoods, Operation Gladio in Europe, the Gulf of Tonkin incident which began the Vietnam war and the attack on the USS Liberty are all shown to have been engineered events.

With this in mind we move on to look at 7/7. Jones presents evidence of not only foreknowledge of the bombings by Mossad and British intelligence but also complicity in the attacks. Why was Benjamin Netanyahu warned 10 minutes before the first explosion not to leave his hotel which was in close proximity to Liverpool Street station? How did Visor Consulatants manage to predict in exact detail the London bombings? Why did no eye witnesses place any of the bombers at the scene of the crime? Why did all the cctv cameras malfunction which should have caught the bombers movements?

Retired CIA analyst Ray McGovern talks about the reality of the Iraqi conflict. Michael Meacher gives his own view of the Bush administrations fixation on conflict and controlling strategic oil supplies. ""Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor."" (PNAC, 2000) Americans still believe WMD were found in Iraq! The oil industry & weapons industry are two of the largest lobby groups in the USA and these are the people who are pushing for war.

Iran is the likely next target despite being ten years from developing nuclear weapons. Ray McGovern says that despite this, ""The Crazies"" are running USA foreign policy and are in favour of invading Iran.

Evidence is given of 9/11 being a failed coup d'etat rather than an attack by bin Laden et al. Why did the US air force stand down and allow three planes to fly around unmolested and crash in to buildings on the morning of 9/11? Why did Bush sit & listen to stories about a pet goat while planes flew in to the twin towers? Why did the 9/11 commission fail to answer the most pertinent questions? Alex presents compelling evidence that the twin towers and WTC 7 were all controlled demolitions.

""Modern warfare is all about selling the population to love its own enslavement.""

Do yourself a big favour and not only watch this film today but pass it on to your friends and family.",1168473600,4,2769,4.7924528301886795
2639962,5,B000HRJLM4,"Until TerrorStorm my mind was just not going to accept that there was a conspiracy afoot. My mind was so conditioned to doubt, that I had a difficult time with the truth, in fact I was one of those that gave no credibility to any conspiracy theory. What I have found out is that, it is no longer a conspiracy, what they are not doing or planning in secret now, they are doing openly, therefore it is no longer a conspiracy.

When you watch this stunning video, you will become aware of how far the rabbit hole goes, and that will inspire you to take a hard look at your elected officials and ask the hard questions.  I believe this country was a lot better off when we questioned the actions of our elected officials. Go beyond the normal news rhetoric, dig deeper, find out the truth for yourself. Stop believing every story you hear from the news media, become informed about the true goals. When you can identify what is socialism and despotism then you will be getting close to the truth.

If you have not experienced TerrorStorm, go now and order your copy and expose it to your friends. We may only have one true election period left in this country. We must elect a third party to the White House, both our current leading parties have been infiltrated by people who believe in Global Dominance, in a New World Order, and they will do anything to bring it into reality. When your elected officials declare ""the end justifies the means"", they are saying to you that it is not wrong to cheat, lie, violate oaths or even destroy human life if it is for a good cause.  When our President is on record for cursing the Constitution, watch out, in fact, it would do you well to read the new proposed Constituition, it will shock you!!

Read the planks of the Communist Manifesto and capare it to our current national policy and you will see very quickly that almost all the planks are in place.  Did you know that our government plans to build a super highway connecting Mexico to Canada through the mid-west irregardless of public opinion?  I suggest you begin with TerrorStorm, then progress on to educate yourself and your children and let's elect a real group of Americans to Congress, the Senate, your local government and elect an American President, not one who has been groomed by the elite. WE must eliminate electronic voting and return to counting ballets, put the power of government back into the hands of each Governor of each state, eliminate Federal funding of our states and our educational system.

Do your due diligence NOW before they create another 9/11 to further take away your rights. HOLD those accountable for 9/11.

I recommend TerrorStorm to you and all your friends, family, and co-workers and especially to your Pastor, Priest or religious leader. The 501C document your church signed is according to Past Judge Rhinequest and his cohort Janet Reno is irrevocable, that means if your church is under the 501c, you pastor cannot preach the truth about your government from the pulpit.  King George told Benjamin Franklin, ""I do not fear your militia, but I do fear the men in black robes with the white color who preach Liberty from the pulpit"".

Time is short for Liberty in America, in fact it may already be gone....The tree of Liberty is in the winter of our Distress, we pay too much in taxes, everything we do has to have a license, we do not legally elect our officals (it's controlled), our news media will not tell us the truth, (they are testing a new tax on how many miles you drive), your food is being geneticly engineered (have to reduce the population), 52% of all Americans are on some prescribed medication, our children are not being educated (have no idea what the Bill of Rights are, they do Mock UN Conferences instead), our Pastors are under IRS control, there is more a lot more.

Terrorstorm shows example after example, including 9/11 and the London 7/7 bombings, of how Governments are the source of almost all terror we see in the modern world.

With what seems like endless amounts of news articles, newsbites and official government documents to support it, Terrorstorm stands on its own as the definitive documentary of our lifetime and is a must see for anyone living and breathing this present second.

Don't delay, there are so many key facts in this documentary that everyone should know about that effect us every day.

2639965,5,B000HRJLM4,"I hope everyone gets to see this and other films by Alex Jones but there are many others films and books on this and other subjects like this.

I myself have done research and seen documents that many call frightening but I have taken action by informing others on this and other subjects of terrorism and tyranny. Which I hope helps to stop the ones I love from being hurt by the continual taking away of rights that were given by a creator that has instilled in us a sense of justice, love of freedom and life.

It saddens me to see that these leaders of industry and politics can only come up with tyranny and oppression which in the end will only lead to the demise of themselves and other caught in the deceitful web of lies and unending war mongering.

It also shows to me that they are weak and shortsighted since we should be reaching for the stars.  Instead we are willing to fight for scraps of land and petty things that in the end of or lives will mean nothing.  When we do things that are not for self gain are we truly remembered forever fondly.  For the works I see men doing make Hitler almost look like a saint by comparison.  When will we learn to turn our swords into plow shears.

If they claim to be great why can they not teach us to live in peace without the threat of a gun.  Why is fear the only thing they know how to teach?  All people are able to learn if taught correctly and with compassion and patience.

Too few people know this and need to be shown this film! I've showed atleast 30 people that I know. Of course, I'm always doing things of that nature. The voice you will hear throughout this documentary is that of Alex Jones. I've listened to Alex's radio show for severaI years now and am accustomed to his Texas tone. The facts presented in this film are indisputable. The conclusions that Alex draws can be disputed, but there isn't much room to do so. One state sponsored terror act that Mr. Jones does not cover in this film is TWA flight 800, which was a disappointment for me. It was a disappointment because over 200 AMERICANS saw a missile hit the plane. And like Sept. 11. 2001, orginazations/individuals helped cover it up. Popular Mechanics wrote a piece about TWA flight 800 as well. Of course! It was a glitch in the fuel tank. Give me a break. For those of you who are still blinded by the B.S., this film should help rake some of the poo from your eyes. There are many other films about such things, but in my opinion this is one of the best. Please, for the love of this REPUBLIC, not Democracy(Demos+Ocracy[Latin]=Mob Rule) see this film. After you've viewed the film, do some research on the parts you believe to be untrue(Don't be lazy).

For those of you who don't know Alex Jones is a regular at Ground Zero memorials.

A man who has recently appeared on tape saying that ""the firefighters were paid off!"" (in ref to the collapse of WTC #7 on 9/11) He ""believes"" that the firefighters who saw WTC 7 leaning, creaking, horribly damaged by falling debris, and burning intensely on 9/11 were paid by the NWO or somesuch to make these eyewitness statements.

should wake up the conspiracy deniers from their mainstream

cover and flack for the defense of the standard

are now so blatant in their criminality and lies that it takes an act of

Now, this film is very information-packed, fast paced, and exciting to watch, and it adheres closely to the facts.  There may be a few differences I have with the emphases Jones puts on some things. But I can think for myself, and just because Jones doesn't expose the Zionist nature of so much of the globalist power elite, that does not detract from this outstanding contribution to the cause of freedom.

Why is it so important that most people know that 9/11 and 7/7 were false flag attacks and inside jobs?  Aside from obvious and vital issue of justice for the living and the dead, there is the simple reason that if enough people know about the use of this pure evil strategy - and make no mistake, that is what it is - the future would be perpetrators of another 9/11 (but much worse) will be less likely to try it if they realize a very large proportion of the population is wise to their game.

If you still don't believe 9/11 was an inside job read CHRISTIAN FAITH AND THE TRUTH BEHIND 9/11 by David Ray Griffin or see some of the following DVD's:  911 MYSTERIES PART ONE: DEMOLITIONS, LOOSE CHANGE II, 9/11: IN PLANE SITE, and PAINFUL DECEPTIONS.

2640013,5,B000HRJLM4,"Back in 1999, I had the fortunate pleasure of receiving an email from my good friend up north who is contantly researching the New World Order.  The email was entitled ""American Death Camps by Samuel Foster"" and was about this fellow who claimed to be in the military and said that by the year 2001, the UN, Nato, and other governmental forces were going to revamp America, along with the rest of the world, and turn it into a slave state where religion would be done away with, as well as many other freedoms.  Well, it seems rather interesting that, in 2001, the event of September 11th happened, which could very well be the first in a whole series of events to lead America and the world in the direction of a New World Order slave state.  I am not political in any shape or form.  However, I am a Bible student and I belong to a Christian organization that has never known anything about the New World Order at all, yet for the past 50 yrs, this particular organization in which I belong has been talking about how, according to vivid Bible prophecy, that within our lifetime, that God would cause the United Nations to turn against organized religion by way of a one-world government, and this would lead up to the end of this present order of things and pave the way for a Paradise Earth.  I'm not here to give a sermon.  I just felt compelled to explain how I have seen some startling coincidences in regards to this prophecy and how everthing seems to be really shaping up with events that are unfolding in the present times we live.  Whether one believes this or not is up to them, but the other main point I wanted to make is that this a well-crafted documentary that just presents the facts as they are and one finds it very difficult to refute.  There was a time that I thought of people who talked about the New World Order as a bunch of paranoid alarmist crackpots getting a kick out of scaring people.  However, after viewing this present Alex Jones production, I have to say that these people actually know what they are talking about.  But don't take my word for it.

The first half goes into some historical examples of govt sponsored terror. Than Alex goes to London and blows the 7-7 terror story away. One thing he included here that didn't appear in his other films is the evidence, and proof that the WTC was downed by Therm-ate. Therm-ate is a high explosive that can liquefy steel. It is the only thing that can explain the pools of molten metal that were found at ground zero days after the detonation. The New York Times calls these pools the biggest mystery about 9-11. One part that I found particularly disturbing was the interview with Bush supporters outside his Crawford Texas ranch. Just to imagine how brainwashed some people can be is terrifying. An example is that they claim we did find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That is something even Bush hasn't said, and these people think it is the gospel truth. You have to see this film! I also fully recommend getting his Film Martial Law 9-11: Rise of the Police State. It focuses more on the evidence of 9-11 itself. It talks more about building 7.

As the stakes for the future for our nation, our friends, families and, indeed the world, have risen to new heights, it becomes a greater responsibility for us to begin to separate the historical wheat from the chaff, as it were.

This documentary is a strong (very strong) and practical tool, with which we can adjust our thinking about what is going on in the world today. Terrorstorm can help us collect a broad range of previously (presumably) unconnected facts, so that we may find the common threads and use these facts to support a truer, more realistic picture of the world that we live in today. Indeed, we are also able to draw a lot of conclusions about the world we have lived in the recent and distant past and how that affects our present.

I feel that any thinking person should be able to perceive that our collective American fat is hanging right in the fire at the moment. So, our normal spoon-fed consensus reality might not be able to provide the intellectual precision that we currently, and desperately, need to make the very serious decisions that we find lying here before us.

The nightly news will never look the same again.

Even though it's easy to get apathetic with subjects of such overwhelming evil, the truth is empowering and this film will change the way you view the world.

I really loved the ""parting message"" Jones gives at the end of documentary.  Many ""conspiracy theorists"" spout data to put people into fear, whereas Jones obviously realizes this is what the military-industrial complex-controlled media is trying so hard to do, and so his goal is to empower people and bring them UP.  It was refreshing to see this...",1162598400,18,768,4.809160305343512
2640034,5,B000HRJLM4,"This is a monumental video exposing the govt's use of terror attacks on citizens worldwide that is not discussed on the mainstream news networks.  Well documented facts on the Madrid and London bombings that were not exposed on the mainstream networks.  As a bonus it shows the L.A. Symposium which was viewed on C-span in mid '06 which was a pivital point in the history of the 911 Truth Movement.

The only thing I disagree with in the video is the accusation that Hitler started the Reichstag fire to use as an excuse to invade Poland.  Jones doesn't give enough info on the fire or the person who was accused of starting the fire.  The fact is that Germany already had enough reason to invade Poland w/o using the fire as an excuse.  Also note that the accused, Van der Lubbe, was already a communist involved in many orgs thourghout Europe.  He was upset with fellow communists and even the communists that testified in his trial said he was a lone wolf acting soley on his own accord.  Van der Lubbe admited to the fire over and over from the beginning when he was caught even up til his trial.  Read page 339 of John Toland's ""Adolf Hitler"" and Fritz Tobias book Reichstag Fire in which Tobias concludes that the fire was started by neither the Nazis or the Communists but was done soley by Van der Lubbe who acted as a lone wolf.

Jones makes it look as though the ""sole reason"" for the invasion of Poland was because of the fire.  This is simply not true.  There were many other factors chief among them being economics and the fact that the communists were very violent in those days against the govt and citizens who had nothing to do with the politcal process.  Invading Poland was a way of difusing the communist threat against Germany.  What expanded that war was the influence of international communism against German capitalism and their expansion.  If Pearl Habor had never taken place niether the Brits or Americans would've had to get involved in Germany's fight against Red Communism.

Replete with snappy effects, smashing video clips and startling facts, Terror Storm catalogues the use of Terror by Governments against their own people as a pretext for war and for suppressing civil liberties.

 911 is an inside job and until America wakes up and realizes this, our own government will continue to steal and crush everything American because ""They hit us on 911"".

Speaking of Aaron Russo, he's just spent $1,000,000+ on a new film exposing the truth about the puppeteers of the last 20 or more presidential administrations as well as why the money in your pocket right now is with $.04 of what it was worth in the 1930s.

(41 minutes in) The 7/7 bombings in London could not POSSIBLY have happened in order to influence the general election, or any imminent elections, as these bombing took place 2 months AFTER the elections. Blair won the last election with a majority of over 60 seats because the seat boundries in the first past the post system 'gifts' a 60 seat majority to labour on an equal percentage share of the vote.

2640076,5,B000HRJLM4,"There are currently a large number of documentaries available which question the official narrative about 9/11 offered by the Bush administration.  This new film by Alex Jones is among the most convincing and persuasive of these, and is almost certainly the most involving.  Though sympathetic to the general arguments of the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect of TERRORSTORM as a film, but it's an electrifying piece of moviemaking.

  TERRORSTORM discusses 'false flag' terror events, and argues that the current Bush and Blair administrations have - to put it mildly - been less than forthcoming about the real motivations behind the 'War on Terror'.  The film looks at large-scale terror events from history, and uses the narratives surrounding those as a jumping off point to review the official story offered to us about similar terrorist attacks in London and New York.

This is quite a movie.  Some documentaries on 9/11 seem starved for audio/visual material, or perhaps fell afoul of licensing issues when acquiring clips.  TERRORSTORM is briskly edited - considering the amount of detail, it's surprisingly fast paced - features massive amounts of footage from all over, including numerous rare clips from UK and US television, and throws in a substantial number of new interviews as well.  Ray McGovern (the ex CIA-analyst who confronted Donald Rumsfeld on national TV some months back) has some engaging things to say, and Jones himself appears throughout, pushing the film forward with his on camera discussion, interviews and voice-over narration.  The overall tone is tense, engaging and gripping.

The film is extremely well produced, and quite convincing in its analysis of the issues involved.  Jones must have access to a great deal of archival footage, as there are images (such as the lengthy clip of the London subway blast, or the arresting shot of some type of molten metal leaking from the side of one of the WTC towers, quite a distance beneath the point of impact) that I'd never seen before.  Some scenes (such as the interview with the female street vendor in London who discusses the de Menezes subway shooting in horribly cavalier fashion) are just as powerful as anything in Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  It's a worthwhile comparison, as in retrospect Moore's film now seems to treat the government's 'official story' with kid gloves despite a growing amount of evidence to the contrary, whilst Jones, appropriately, doesn't pull any of his punches.  The section of TERRORSTORM that discusses the London bombings is one of the more gripping and horrific parts of the film, and is even blackly comic in parts.  Folks aware of the various 'mock' terrorist-attack government wargames that took place on 9/11 - Vigilant Warrior, Vigilant Guardian, and all the other suggestively named US military game activities that 'coincidentally' took place that day - should find that the extensive footage in TERRORSTORM of UK television hosts discussing the 'coincidental' mock terror attack being staged by the Government within the train tubes on the same day of the London blasts speaks absolute volumes.

  Along with this movie, I'd highly recommend reading Webster Tarpley's phenomenal book 9/11 SYNTHETIC TERROR: MADE IN USA, which deals with much of the same important subject matter.  TERRORSTORM gets a solid recommendation.  It's a powerful piece of filmmaking, a provocative discussion on topics surrounding 9/11, and truly one of the most arresting movies I've seen in quite a while.",1162339200,25,3521,5.1946902654867255

Alex Jones again gives us the answers. Using documented and admitted cases of false flag terrorism Jones demonstrates that no government can be trusted. Including and maybe ESPECIALLY the US Government!

The film is an eye opener for those unfamiliar with the crimes that government routinely commits against its own citizens and the citizens of other nations. Actually Jones barely scratches the surface of known and admitted cases of government sponsored false-flag terror but the cases he presents here are irrefutable and fully documented.

Buy several copies and give them away. At this price there is no excuse not to get 5-10 copies, put a label on them and pass them around.

A quick Thought Experiment:

What is the one and only rule of capitalism? People act in their self-interest. It's not the free market, it's not competition, it's not individuals working to maximize their wealth/power playing by the rules. If a person can increase his wealth/power by breaking a law, and reasonably believes he can get away with it, then it is in his self-interest disregard the law. So in a capitalist society, who will end up holding positions of wealth/power? Those who are the best capitalists; those who will seek increase their wealth/power at all costs.",1162339200,23,1162,4.863636363636363

Witness in horror as a mindless sheeple in London declares ""I think we should give up liberty for freedom."" Pure doublespeak and pure doublethink.

Witness in horror as the American government declares that the President is above the law and can create any law he wishes, even if it is unconstitutional. Witness CIA chief Michael Hayden re-interpret the Fourth Amendment to be friendly with George W. Bush's dictatorial ""powers"".

Witness the criminal governments declare that protests must take place in ""free speech zones,"" which is a blatant violation of the First Amendment.

Witness Charlie Sheen being brave enough to question the ""official"" 9/11 story, which culminated at the explosive 9/11 American Scholars Symposium.

This is one of the most important documentaries to ever come out. The proof of the evidence presented in this film is out there. Operation Northwoods, once the ""kook theory of kook tin-foil-hat conspiracy theorists,"" was and is real. The Reichstag Fire has been exposed as an inside job by the Nazis.

know they have been operated on and

often can go home the same day as

the proceedure without any pain or

complications.

If you can watch this video are are still asleep or in denial then you're either one of the sleeple, or you're being paid to deny and help build the Prison Planet.",1356739200,,326,4.45

8140789,5,B000HRJLM4,"This film and another film called Meeting Resistance were laying on the library cart ready to be restocked. I grabbed 3 films blindly off the cart and these were 2 of the 3.  I am not into war type films but watched them anyway.  Tony Blair was bad but come on Brown is worse.  Where are the self-terrorist attacks to keep Brown who is as bad as Obama in office if this film were true?  Barack Obama is more power hungry than Bush and that is saying something as they both stink.  If this movie tracks true, is it saying the the U.S. will conspire to ""hit"" itself with a 911 type thing so people will rally around Obama?  Not gonna happen.  Obama is  a fiscally irresponsible blank.  If we get ""hit"", it won't be a self-hit done by a U.S. person (or one of our allies we paid to do it) but because this administration lowered our defenses and his credibility (too much like lovey dovey Jimmy Carter) and our enemies could not  resist hitting us.

What is true is this film maker's bravery for speaking out on anything now.  For that he gets 5 stars from me.",1245196800,,1057,4.256281407035176
