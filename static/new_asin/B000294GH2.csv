2069085,4,B000294GH2,"This fun romp was as good as I remember, from seeing it as a teen. At the time of release, though, this Buena Vista (Disney) motion picture stirred up so much fuss, it hastened the birth of Touchstone Pictures. The ""problem"" was obvious, as I watched the film for the 1st time as an adult. There was ""adult"" innuendo throughout the storyline, often to great hilarity, but in 1983, folks who thought they were getting standard family fare, from a trusted source, were not laughing. That's too bad, b/c the comedic timing of Kidder, & the always affable Hays, was well above par. Supporting cast turned in great performances, as well, making for an entertaining romp that's tame by modern standards. The movie's ""controversy"" was somewhat over-stated, but Disney honchos got the message. Post-Trenchcoat, anything geared past a ""kiddie"" audience was released as a Touchstone pic. My only complaint about this cinema time-capsule? Hubs & I agreed---too bad the characters didn't return for a sequel! We should've liked to see that.",1396396800,3,1028,5.017543859649122
2069086,4,B000294GH2,"""Trenchcoat"" is a pleasant little mystery with Arab drug dealers, car chases and Margot Kidder doing comic takes.  It does not have the quality of the best british mysteries, but is as good as a couple of Peter Ustinov's lesser Poirot's.  Definitely worth watching.",1386892800,3,265,5.0
2069087,5,B000294GH2,We've been looking for this movie in DVD for a long time.  When the movie came out  it was in VHS form. It's a fun movie to watch.  Recommend for anyone.,1380672000,,153,3.870967741935484
2069088,4,B000294GH2,"Love the movie - an oldie but goodie.  Great cast with Margot Kidder, Robert Hayes and David Suchet.  David Suchet is especially fun to watch because I love him in his iconic portrayal of Hercule Poirot.",1378684800,2,203,4.611111111111111
2069089,4,B000294GH2,I've waited a long time to get a copy of this movie. I had an old VHS version which was poorly done cinematically. This movie had great clarity and was nicely done.,1376352000,2,164,4.15625
2069090,4,B000294GH2,just a good movie to escape into.  had not seen it in years  which it was a reasonable price on dvd,1375056000,,99,3.6666666666666665

2069092,5,B000294GH2,"This is a fun little movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Lots of memorable lines. It proves that movies don't have to be rocket sience, gory, or laced with obscenities and sex to be enjoyed.",1360972800,2,196,4.628571428571429

2069094,4,B000294GH2,This is an older movie and it is funny and sometimes I just need funny. One could say it is silly and in this day and age we need silly. I would recommend this movied for someone who needs to get away from the too serious day to day worries.,1355356800,2,241,3.84
2069095,5,B000294GH2,I saw this movies years ago and was very excited to see it in DVD!  I had been looking for it and it had only been available in VHS format.  What a great show!,1355097600,4,159,3.6470588235294117
2069096,4,B000294GH2,"It's a good film, a mystery; and as already had been mentioned above it was something different from any other Disney film at that period, 1983.  It's a good story shot on the Historic Island of Malta.  It could even had been a better picture but the tension within the story as it flows on the screen is there.  If you never been to Malta it's wise to watch this picture from two different perspectives; the story itself and the historic island.

There was one mishap in the way the DVD was presented to the customers.  Although maybe it was remastered but it was a copy taken from the same master copy which was used for the VHS copies.  It started in 2.35:1 (CinemaScope) during the titles but as the titles were over it changed to 4:3 cutting parts of the picture from the width. For me it was the only disappointment, as the transfere was quite good. I never tollerated that films shot in widescreen should be presented otherwise in the present era of high technology, in which we live in today.
This little mishap should not stop you from watching such a thriller.  I must say that I enjoyed it more because when it was being shot in Malta I visited the set a couple of times and had the honour to meet one of the most brilliant cinematographers of the time, Tonino Delli Colli who was the Director of Photography.",1330041600,6,1320,4.407407407407407

8024053,4,B000294GH2,Fun cloak and dagger style '80's flick starring Margot Kidder.  I loved watching it again after all these years.  It is part mystery and part romantic comedy.  Anyone that had HBO when they were a kid will remember this one.,1506988800,,224,4.55
8024054,5,B000294GH2,"I have always loved this movie, and it has lost none of its charm since I first saw it.  I think fans of Scarecrow & Mrs. King would particularly enjoy it.",1495152000,,155,4.0
8024055,5,B000294GH2,"I was looking for another movie with Robert Hays. I can truly say that both Robert and Margot worked together beautifully in this movie. It was funny after the first 15 minutes of seriousness. The movie trailer online with Amazon was what really sold me on this movie. In some ways, this is a tried and true story that has been done in different movies. Margot Kidder is really terrific and I couldn't stop laughing at her antics. I am glad that I took a chance on this hard to find movie. You can tell this was pointing to the Touchstone pictures under Disney line. It isn't really a kid's movie, but for the younger generation this is really nothing to sit through compared with movies out on the theater screens.",1485216000,,715,4.465648854961832
8024056,3,B000294GH2,"Not a lot of movies with Margot Kidder at her peak, so that's one reason to watch Trenchcoat, a spoofy gumshoe thriller she did in 1983, sandwiched between Superman II and Superman III. Kidder is Mickey Raymond, a court stenographer aspiring to be a mystery novelist. Rolling with her credo of ""To write a great novel, you have to live a great novel,"" she takes a two-week holiday to the island of Malta to pen her first detective book. Trenchcoat presents echoes of Charade and Romancing the Stone, never mind that the latter didn't release until the year after, never mind that Trenchcoat isn't as good as those two movies. Trenchcoat gives us sideways advice: When away on vacation, it's a must that you select the right postcard. The wrong postcard may give the wrong impression to the folks back home, may even embroil one in international intrigue and all manner of shady characters. In fact, just about every person that shows up on camera is involved in some underhanded way. Prominent on that list is fast-talking smoothie Terry Leonard (Robert Hays, fresh off Airplane) who is either a doctor or a lawyer or a peddler of tawdry jewelry or whatever else. (C'mon, he's whatever else.)

We should've guessed Mickey would become the primary suspect in a string of murders, she butts heads with the local police inspector (a pre-Poirot David Suchet) often enough. As Mickey, Kidder is very appealing. She and her nonchalant co-star Hays try to hearken back to an older period in cinema in which screwball and wit came dime a dozen. And maybe they would've pulled it off better if only the script had played along. It sucks that Trenchcoat, with its pedestrian plot and choppy editing and tired clichs, comes off more like a small-screen effort. The identities of the true nasties are fairly easy to penetrate, since we'd seen other movies and read books that've tried to lull us like so before.

I say our two leads work up a decent chemistry. There are scenes where you can feel the movie trying to punch up its romantic comedy creds. Maybe you'll roll your eyes - because it's too on the nose - when Mickey fully gets into the spirit of things and dons a trenchcoat and a felt hat. But Margot Kidder as the amateur sleuth in over her head is really fun to watch. Her character is just game enough and clever enough that she does make headway. In the first two Superman movies, she'd shown glimpses of her knack for physical comedy, and she shows that off here in abundance. I liked the scene in which, in full gumshoe regalia, she barges into a seedy bar and offers up a fin in exchange for information.

It's a film in which the acting participants etch out their roles with broad strokes, and that seems appropriate, given the fluff tone and material they have to work with. Trenchcoat - filmed on location in Malta, so it's got nice scenery going for it - is a light and slightly daffy mystery. The intrigue is strictly on low simmer, so you don't really feel the stakes - the murders, the plutonium-trafficking, our imperiled heroine - were all that important. Even Hays as the projected love interest is ocasionally disarming but mostly lacks flavor. It's all to do with the plot calling for his role to be so disingenuous for most of the movie, it's hard to get a good grasp on his character. Instead, it's Kidder's bright presence - Mickey is a less abrasive version of Lois Lane - that compels me to rate this one a better-than-average 3 out of 5 stars. Maybe 3.5. That's how much I like her.",1470441600,,3507,4.608
8024057,5,B000294GH2,This is a very hard to get DVD and though it is a copy and not High Definition if you just want a copy for your collection - the price is right. If you like comedies this movie is worth seeing & adding to your collection.,1469664000,,221,3.8260869565217392

8024060,5,B000294GH2,I love this movie and was so happy to find it on Amazon.,1457222400,,56,3.3846153846153846
8024061,3,B000294GH2,"The pace of this film is too slow. The director failed to show enough of the scenery of the Island of Malta; though there are a couple of brief scenic glimpses. This movie is way over-priced at $24 with shipping. If the movie had cost $5; I would have liked it a lot more. It is a $5 movie. I will not watch it again.

Margot Kidder's male love interest in the movie is NOT likeable until the very end of the movie. Thus, this movie does NOT work as a drama; though it is paced slowly as a drama. The plot of the movie is: Margot, a writer of suspense, spy-novels, goes to Malta to become inspired, and innocently becomes caught-up in the happenings of spies, with people getting murdered all around her. Thus, the movie is supposed to be an action film with comedy, but it lacks the quick pacing that a film of action or comedy must have.

The movie was released in 1983; likely filmed during the tenure of Disney CEO Card Walker.",1455494400,,931,4.254237288135593
