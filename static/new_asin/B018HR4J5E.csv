8742370,5,B018HR4J5E,"Why would a brilliant man devote his entire life to learning everything possible about Gustav Mahler, the man and his music?

In short, it has been a labor of love.  Professor Henry-Louis de la Grange has spent his entire life living for the love of Mahler.

Why?

As Henry-Louis says, We meet the infinite everywhere when we listen to Mahler.
Henry-Louis love began in 1945, when at age 21, he heard a Carnegie Hall performance of Mahlers Ninth Symphony, conducted by Bruno Walter.  A few weeks later, he heard a performance of Mahlers Fourth Symphony, again with Bruno Walter conducting.  How could merely two performances so transform a life?  Henry-Louis replies, Something happened in me the first time, which made it obvious that I must work for Mahler.

Mahler has this affect on certain people.  A friend of mine compares it to feeling one has suddenly become part of a chosen peopleindividuals who for whatever reason, feel Mahlers music speaks to them;  speaks to them of something beyond our daily lifesomething perhaps supernatural.

My own first Mahler experience happened 24 years after Henry-Louis awakening.  I turned on the radio, expecting classical music, but was greeted by a magical experience which was like a message from a higher sphere.  Transfixed by the music, I knew I had to continue listening, to finally hear who it was who had written this mysterious music from another realm, far above our usual earthly fare.  I mention my personal experience because it is typical of what happens to Mahlerians when they first hear music so unlike any they have heard before.

So perhaps this is an explanation of HLDLGs lifes work.  He has a leave no stone unturned curiosity to learn all that can be known about the amazing Gustav Mahler and his unique music.

This DVD provides the thoughts of many who know and appreciate HLDLG and Mahler and his music.  They speak of Henry-Louis unquenchable thirst for knowledge and his assiduous scholarship in ascertaining and discerning the truth from the unsubstantiated regarding Mahler.

We, the viewers, get to join Henry-Louis and his ubiquitous dog for strolls from the Agdal gardens of Marrakech to the streets of Paris and the paths of Toblach.  What an honor and wonderful opportunity to walk with him!

As to what else this delightful film includes, you will see the treasures of the Mdiathque Musical Mahler in Paris for descriptions of Mahler memorabilia and the most complete collection anywhere of research on Mahler.  Of course, there are also many insightful comments by some of the people who best know Henry-Louis:  conductors Riccardo Chailly, Christoph Eschenbach, Pierre Boulez, baritone Thomas Hampson, Bruno Mgevand, founder of the Societ Gustav Mahler de Genve, and the delightful Marina Mahler, Gustavs granddaughter.  Youll also see Henry-Louis long love affair with his pet dogs, which have demanded of him the daily walks and exercise required for good health.  He also uses yoga and free weights to maintain the muscle tone needed for health as we grow older.

You may be intrigued to learn of his many years of scuba diving and his work to restore an old convent in Corsica.

Now in his nineties, Henry-Louis is working hard on an improved Volume One of his Mahler biographies.  Although eager to read it, I share Thomas Hampsons perspective, when he said,  I hope it takes him another ten years to finish Volume One, because Im quite convinced thats whats keeping him alive, and I want to celebrate his 100th birthday!

Thank you, director and producer Jason Starr, for this tribute and excellent insight into the life and motivations of the greatest Mahler scholar.",1451779200,17,3658,4.978583196046128
