2555214,1,B000F9SUS0,Thought it was very boring.  Waste of time watching it.  It was foreign made and not very interesting.,1173398400,6,102,4.611111111111111
2555215,3,B000F9SUS0,"Most of the movies are low budget and very amateur.  Never the less, I really enjoyed one in particular.  Sleep Disorder, creepy, dark, haunting.",1160956800,2,145,5.0
2555216,4,B000F9SUS0,"I ordered a copy of Hostile Hauntings not too long ago and I must say I got my monies worth.

I really enjoyed the stories for the first film ""The Shunned House"" and

""The River: Legend of La Llorona"" found on the second disc. Those would have to be my

two favorites. I like the acting, music, script and feel of those films. I also dug

""The Woodland Hauntings 2"" - That was a very bizare movie, to say the least.

I'm so burnt out on Hollywood remakes and plotless garbage with big name actors thinking

they can make up for a scriptless, special effects vehicle where things (such as cats) pop

out of nowhere just for the sake of a few cheap scares. These movies had it all...story,

boobs, blood, and good laughs. A few of the films were too weird for me, like

""Sleep Disorder."" It gave me just that. Otherwise, I liked what I saw.",1157673600,6,838,4.253164556962025
2555217,1,B000F9SUS0,I rated this video one star only because I couldn't rate it lower.  It's so bad it's impossible to watch it though.  I put it though my shredder.,1156809600,,145,4.142857142857143
8119267,1,B000F9SUS0,"I bought this out out of a catalog, for a few dollars.  a total waste.  I thought I was watching some film students movies.  How did this crap get made?  Did someones Daddy give them an extra allowence to buy videotape?  and the actor in the film Hellbound book of the dead.  Jeff Dylan Graham.  DING DING DING.  My Gaydar went off big time.  Dude, go do gay porn.  You are so gay.",1308528000,,381,4.095890410958904
8119268,1,B000F9SUS0,"""B"" films can be enternaining enough to pass the time away, however, Hostile Hauntings makes you want the nightmare to end. All the films on this DVD are like a school film project gone wrong. Poor filming, poor acting and poor plots. No wonder the ""artist"" is not provided. I would be afraid to have my name attached to this too. This DVD is not worthing of the $5.00 bin at Walmart. Save your money.",1261872000,,401,4.36
8119269,1,B000F9SUS0,"I expected these to be bad.  I knew they would be bad.  Some of my students (Junior High) and I were looking for Youtube videos of La Llarona, and found the previews for this.  Knowing full well that these were going to be ""bad"" movies, I ordered it anyway.  I've always agreed with Stephen King, and have actively sought ""bad"" in order to stumble across the occasional gem.  There are none here.  There is not even any zircon here.  I don't quite feel ripped off by this collection, because I knew what I was getting, but it did leave me with the unfulfilled feeling one get when hoping for something, and getting nothing.",1210809600,,623,4.460176991150442
8119270,1,B000F9SUS0,This is what happens when you buy something cheap sometimes.  I could not even watch all of the movies. There should be a trial period on some of these bad movies.  Money back if you hate the movies.,1207267200,,199,4.2105263157894735
8119271,1,B000F9SUS0,"Probably the biggest waste of time I've spent on my couch. Could not even watch the first movie because the sound is so bad I can't tell what they are saying. The second movie was made better but was really short and the ending was a major letdown. The third was ridiculous, a few almost funny parts but overall this was pretty much the worst collection I've ever seen. I'm not watching the second disk, I'm just dropping it off at Goodwill.",1205798400,,441,4.390243902439025
8119272,1,B000F9SUS0,"I bought these with the intention that it would be ideal for the whole family to watch around Halloween-not so!
None of us managed to get through the first movie and we've watched some pretty bad movies in our day/
It is very poorly done even for a low budget production. The sound will go from low to high and the scenes are awfully taken/
I usually do not really dislike anything that much but do yourself a favour-learn from our mistake- save your money!",1192233600,,457,4.3882352941176475
8119273,1,B000F9SUS0,"Folks, this helped me gain free shipping on my order! Don't bother buying it for entertainment however, the movies won't hold your attention any better than the average commercial! A total waste!",1189555200,,195,5.125
8119274,1,B000F9SUS0,"Absolutely bad, bad, bad. Acting is bad - plots are bad! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!",1187827200,,80,4.0625
8119275,1,B000F9SUS0,"Instead of Hostile Hauntings, these movies should have been called ""Hostile  Acting"" The lighting was terrible. I could barely hear with my television set to very loud.  The best of the worst was Hellbound-Book of the Dead, followed by The River: Legend of LaLlorona. The story and acting in those two were worth watching----provided one could not be entertained by a blank screen. The best thing about these dvds was the price. The worst thing was everything esle. This is definately not one I will be keeping. If producers of any movie cannot at a minimum get the lighting and sound right, then wait until you have enough money to do so. And for buyer's sake, if  you are going to use your friends for your movies, make sure they can act. Some of these ""movies"" made no sense whatsoever. It is amazing what the cover and blog of a dvd will do. That is what made me buy it. Watching it is what will make me throw it away. Do not rent, Do not buy. Go with your first instincts. If the price is too low for a dvd-it is not worth watching. You are right. I boought it for you. Trust me. I am a slasher flick/haunted house king of dvds.  If you need an extra case, this is for you. If you need a good movie, try ""Do You Wanna Know a Secret?"". Six for the price of one. I will take the one if the story is good, the acting is ok, the soundtrack-one can hear and the lighitng is well,  lit.",1186272000,,1385,4.19172932330827
8119276,5,B000F9SUS0,"I liked 4 of the films on this set. ""The River: Legend of La Llorona,"" ""The Shunned House,"" ""The Woodland Haunting,"" and ""The Sonambulist..."" although that would of made a better feature than short. But for $9.00 you can't go wrong. Some people expect the world for that price.",1178755200,,277,4.673469387755102
