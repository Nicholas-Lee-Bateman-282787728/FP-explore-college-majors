8699668,2,B00158QF1Y,"Possessed (David Lai, 1983)

David Lai made two movies before Possessed, whose original title is Meng gui chu long, but judging by IMDB ratings, no one's actually seen them. Johnny Mak, who produced the second of them, came back with his bankroll for this one, his third, and the two came up with a winner at the box office. Not as much with the critics, which was to be expected; this is a straight-up exploitation flick masquerading as a supernatural thriller. (It's not outside the realm of possibility that the two of them had seen Amityville II: The Possession, released the year previous in America; the two have some strikingly similar themes.) If you're a fan of this sort of crazy Asian supernatural thriller (think a low-rent Hausu, perhaps), you may find this piece of silliness worth a look.

Hsiao-ming (The Legend of Drunken Master's Siu-ming Lao) is a cop who gets involved in a nasty case that ends up with a perp being killed. After that, things are pretty much left up to the viewer... is Hsiao possessed, or is everything that happens afterwards all in his head? The ambiguity alone is pretty interesting in a movie of this type, but it's enhanced by some other weirdnesses that could really only be gotten away with given the ""all in his head"" explanation, at least given film censors. For example, Hsiao's protectiveness towards his sister (Tiger Cage's Irene Wan, who like Mak returned from Lai's second outing) takes a decidedly erotic bent. (Some of the best scenes in the movie come from said sister and her hapless university boyfriend trying to find a place to be alone and make out.) Eventually, everyone involved ends up talking to an exorcist at the local Buddhist temple, and a complex ritual is performed involving a golden statue of a four-faced Buddha and nine plaques... but I'm getting way ahead of myself. Oh, wait, I'm not, there's not really much more to this silliness.

It's not horribly-acted, and Lai is a competent director, if nothing more; the movie almost entirely lacks atmosphere other than ""unintentionally hilarious"", but Hsiao's partner, also named Hsiao (Fighting Madam 2's Gary Siu) is capable of providing fine comic relief, and the head exorcist is amusing. Not something you'll watch often, but it's worth a run through. **

Possessed II (David Lai, 1984)

Buoyed by the success of Possessed, the team of David Lai and producer Johnny Mak threw together a sequel, Yan gui fa kuang, a year later. In this one, a family moves into a home possessed by the spirits of the family who lived there before, the wife goes nuts/is possessed, and the husband (a drunk cop, though no relation that I could tell to the cops in the original) has to figure out what's going on, eventually with the help of a band of hare krishna exorcists led by a transplaned westerner (Jayson Case in his only screen appearance). Some of the details have changed, but the setup is the same, and Lai and Mak bring nothing new to the table from their first outing. Maybe worth it if you really liked the first one, otherwise you can safely skip it. * ",1295395200,,3084,4.708719851576994
