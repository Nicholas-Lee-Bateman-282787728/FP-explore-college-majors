6588327,5,B00MKPYH52,"To say that this film is extraordinary is an understatement. Thank you, Klaudia Kovacs, for your powerful, insightful, creative, and moving documentary about the '56 Hungarian Revolution. I love how you juxtaposed the amazing variety of interviews, archival footage, cultural markers, and wonderful use of music. I learned so much from it, helping me connect the dots from my childhood. ~ Marta Fuchs, MLS, MFT, Professional Speaker, Psychotherapist, and author of Legacy of Rescue: A Daughter's Tribute",1407715200,2,503,5.545454545454546
6588328,5,B00MKPYH52,"""'Torn from the Flag' was an awesome experience for me, having just re-read 'The Bridge at Andau' - I lived through those days (We escaped when I was almost 6 and have a number of memories...) and your film really touched me! Keep on with the great work!""",1407628800,,255,4.333333333333333

6588330,5,B00MKPYH52,"A gripping documentary. Klaudia Kovacs has done an amazing job of assembling a roster of interviewees (both Hungarians and select foreigners) whose own compelling personal storiesas politicians, diplomats, soldiers, ordinary citizenscarry forward the narrative of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, one of the pivotal moments of Cold War history. Equally amazing is the actual video footage of Budapest under siege, smuggled out of the country after the uprising. The documentary truly does justice to its subject, and is packaged in a way that is friendly to an international (English-speaking) audience.",1407628800,2,604,5.722222222222222
6588331,5,B00MKPYH52,"I grew up in Hungary during the seventies and eighties. Our high school history lessons ended with1945 and everything that followed after that in Hungarian history was a puzzle that I, just like most of the people of my generation, was trying to put together from various books, newspaper articles, documentaries and personal stories. Klaudia Kovacs's ""Torn From the Flag"" definitely ties everything together, finally giving us that last chapter that was sorely missing from our history books. A truly fascinating documentary for all, whether you are a Hungarian or have Hungarian roots or just are simply interested in the history of the post WWII era of the Eastern Bloc.",1407628800,2,673,5.127272727272727
6588332,5,B00MKPYH52,"I had read George Orwell's novel 1984 my Freshman year of high school, and while I had appreciated what it taught me concerning the dangers of a communist government, I had generally perceived that the things written in the novel were only projections of what could be. Watching this film made me realize that the things Orwell wrote were not predictions but reality. I am so grateful that I enjoy the freedoms denied to those in Hungary during that period. Not only is this film enlightening, but it's beautifully composed, and those who are interviewed are truly fascinating primary witnesses of the awful injustices done during the Hungarian revolution. Truly wonderful.",1407628800,3,673,5.072072072072072
8672900,5,B00MKPYH52,"The Torn from the Flag by director Ms. Klaudia Kovacs is certainly a masterpiece in its category. This award winning film is the best documentary ever made on the 1956 Hungarian Revolution which was one of key geopolitical events that shaped the history of the 20th century by setting into motion a geopolitical process that eventually lead to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet bloc in the late 1980s. This is the only documentary on the subject that accurately depicts the entire global geopolitical situation of the time with far reaching conclusions. A great documentary and uplifting experience. I highly recommend this documentary especially for educational and training institutions, schools and universities as well as students, researchers or anybody who want to understand the true history of the 20th century.",1428364800,,840,5.1838235294117645

8672902,5,B00MKPYH52,"I was born and raised in communism , but as a hungarian from Transylvania did not know much about the communism in Hungary, or about the Revolution of 1956.  Thanks to this award winning documentary, I learned so much about  the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and  about the people who fought  for their freedom. It is an excellent learning tool for students to understand more about the political challenges that the hungarian people faced at  that time. The 1956 revolution was the first step that hungarians made toward democracy. I highly recommend this documentary!",1424131200,,565,5.032258064516129
8672903,5,B00MKPYH52,"I saw Torn from the Flag when I was in High School on my own time. However, I truly believe that all world history high school and college classes could benefit from showing Torn from the Flag in class. It is a first hand account of the events surrounding communism in Europe, specifically in Hungary, and the citizen lead revolutions which inspired the cold war era world. The stunning visuals, the first hand accounts from the likes of Henry Kissinger and the 'rebels' themselves, and the rare footage included make this documentary a perfect fit for introducing the events, concepts, and themes of the mid 20th century to young adults.

There are moments when Torn from the Flag is brutally honest about the conditions of communist Hungary, and many of those moments stay with me today. But these moments actualize the bravery of the Hungarian people, (and in a broader sense, those under communist regimes all over the world) and solidify the terror and injustices of these oppressive governments. I can't recommend it enough.",1422403200,3,1030,4.919540229885057

8672905,5,B00MKPYH52,"A thought provoking, beautifully made film. Klaudia Kovacs's award winning ""Torn from the Flag"" is my favorite documentary on the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. This films allows you to meet with renowned politicians and eye witnesses explaining the events of the Hungarian Revolution in which tens of thousands were killed and almost a quarter of a million citizens became refugees almost overnight. The documentary does an excellent job explaining the 1945-1991 era, the rise and the fall of communism.
A truly great work. Highly recommend!

8672907,5,B00MKPYH52,"""'Torn from the Flag' was an awesome emotional experience for me, having just re-read 'The Bridge at Andau' by James Michener - I lived through those days (My parents and I along with a couple of relatives escaped when I was almost 6 and have a number of vivd memories...my father borrowed a small truck and came to pick me up at my grandparent's...driving into Budapest to rejoin my mother we saw a Russian tank plow through a picket fence around a small farmhouse, shove its main gun through a window and blow the house to bits...lime-covered bodies lining the roads as we got into the city...the sound of gunfire...) - your film really touched me! This is an important documentary as an educational tool for schools, libraries and educational institutions in general to teach recent history and show the heroic struggles of an oppressed nation to re-gain their freedom. Ultimately the Revolution was brutally crushed when some 300,000 Russian troops and armored divisions rolled back into Hungary after the freedom fighters defeated the Soviet garrison forces. It took many years for Hungary to throw off the yoke of communism, certainly not from lack of trying!  Keep on with the great work!""",1421625600,,1196,4.920792079207921
