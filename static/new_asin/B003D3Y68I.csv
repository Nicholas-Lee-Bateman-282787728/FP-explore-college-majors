8394645,2,B003D3Y68I,"I couldn't help but feel that the tone manipulated the audience by making statements that were never backed up by facts.  Surely the history of the Borgia family is one that is filled with murder, corruption, intrigue and I suppose incest but the information is presented to make the audience shake its head on how could a pope and his cardinal son ever have gotten away with such things. Trouble is many popes and cardinals had mistresses and children out of wedlock and have themselves manipulated people to have a favorable outcome in their ambitious climb to the top.  True while this isn't the same thing as murder and incest - I feel that this was laid on rather heavily to titilate the viewer.  Go to wikipedia instead.",1358985600,3,726,4.65625
8394646,3,B003D3Y68I,"For anyone interested in the Borgia household and the Renaissance, this is a documentary for you. Very informative and from my own research, correct in most of their facts. There are a few very obvious mistakes, but overall a great movie",1339718400,5,237,4.804878048780488
