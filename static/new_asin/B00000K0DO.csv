1239709,4,B00000K0DO,"Once upon a time two teenage girls, Kit (Sarah Lane) and Libby (Andi Garrett), spent the evening making prank phone calls to random numbers. Then they called up Steve Marak (John Ireland) and told him ""I saw what you did and I know who you are,"" but the two girls did not know that the man had just murdered his wife. Of course, the man wanted to find the two ""witnesses"" and kill them, but just to make things interesting, his neighbor Amy Nelson (played in predictable over-the-top fashion by Joan Crawford), really does know about the murder. However, she has other plans for her neighbor besides sending him to prison.
Actually, ""I Saw What You Did"" might be the best film ever directed by William Castle, king of the exploitation film (""House on Haunted Hill,"" ""The Tingler""), even though it is atypical of his work. Of course Castle did set up ""Shock Sections"" for panicky audience members for this film, but the actual movie is a tense and entertaining thriller. Unfortunately the extras on this DVD are pretty sparse, although it does include Castle's promotional clip along with the theatrical trailer and a miniature reproduction of the poster.",999993600,3,1154,4.8040201005025125
1239710,5,B00000K0DO,"I gave this movie five stars not because it is an Oscar-quality classic - far from it - but because it succeeds on its own terms.  It is scary - very, very scary.  (If you watch it at night, I dare you to go to sleep without double-checking that the doors are locked!)  The over-the-top performances, particularly Joan Crawford's, are also unintentionally funny.  It works because the camp does not diminish the fright and the scares do not get in the way of the hilarity.
Why is this movie so scary?  Others have mentioned the isolated farmhouse, the hazy atmosphere, the feeling of being alone, and the naivet of the girls.  Although some have criticized the teen-age actors, I think the story holds together because Libby and Kit's silly behavior (trying to appear sophisticated while really looking childish) is believable of 15-year-old girls then and now.  Crawford, as a domineering neighbor, adds the camp.  The slam-the-car-door scene is priceless!  And have you ever seen a made-for-horror-movies necklace like the one Joan wears here?
This is not a movie which could be made effectively now (a poor remake was made in 1988) because the plot devices demand a 1960s-type telephone system.  Today, a parent calling up to check on a child could almost always ring through on ""call waiting""; ripping a telephone out of a wall is meaningless in the age of cell phones; and ""Caller ID"" and ""Call Return"" should make phony phone calls a thing of the past.  Even at the time, it required viewers to suspend logic to believe that Mrs. Mannering, hearing non-stop busy signals, would not demand an ""emergency cut in,"" which did exist at the time, or that this middle-class family lacked an extension phone.  But these are minor nits.
The letterbox version now being sold is excellent.  Make sure you see the trailers before and, especially, after the film.  If you like this film, you will also like Strait Jacket, another Castle-Crawford pairing.",984355200,37,1947,4.878419452887538

1239712,5,B00000K0DO,"If you want chilling, hilarious fun, this is most definitely entertainment at it's CAMPIEST best!  Joan Crawford, as 'Amy', is totally filmed through gauze to soften the effects of her hard living & hard drinking years in  Hollywood. Be sure to catch the scene where she is serving a cocktail &  almost falls on her face! (And it wasn't even edited out! ) Notice the  scene where she slams the car door & her beehive hairdo literally falls  apart! When she screams, ""Get outta here!"", her voice sounds like  an outraged truckdriver!  The overacting is just priceless - every scene  is better than the one before! Her long, dramatic death scene is done to  the hilt!  This is 'Mommie Dearest' to the MAX!  I love this movie!  Get  out the popcorn, mix the cocktails, & get ready to be scared & to  LAUGH your head off!  We love you, William Castle!  I give this film  5 Wire Hangers!

To each person they call, they say ""I saw what you did and I know who you are"" One call is to Ireland, who has just killed his wife! Crawford is next in line (she has a crush on Ireland) and she tries to protect the girls. Thin stuff, but the atmosphere is menacing and Crawford is fine (and unintentially hilarious) in her small role. In some scenes, Crawford is obviously tipsy, and her scenes are a trip to observe i. e.

1239714,5,B00000K0DO,"In the days before caller ID when I was in my early teens, my friends and I would sometimes fight boredom by making prank phone calls: ""Is your refrigerator running?"", that sort of thing.  That was when I first saw  this movie on TV, so it really hit close to home.  Did it teach me any  lessons?  Not unless you include a few new phone ideas, but it did give me  a favorite guilty pleasure movie.  After over 20 years of waiting it's  finally on home video.  Some of the humor and acting seem a little dated  now, but most of the suspense scenes are very intense even by today's  standards, and it's as much fun to watch as ever.",938563200,15,630,4.166666666666667

1239718,3,B00000K0DO,"I remember this movie from back in the day and for the fellas please tell me if you don't think Joyce Meadows was shapely or not? She played the mysterious wife who gets killed in the beginning. I had to rewind a few times to believe she had that kind of figure. Overall a campy movie, but the music in the end was just completely out of place. A dead guy is in the back seat and the kids are giggling over their parents being upset at them. Strange ending to what could have been a really good movie.",1261612800,,501,4.070707070707071
1239719,5,B00000K0DO,"Although Joan Crawford had a small role in ""I Saw What You Did"", she nevertheless steals the film from her costars. Joan plays a neighbor to a man who turns out to be a killer unbeknownst to her. She is also having a sordid affair with him. The movie is mainly about two teenage girls making prank phone calls to people at night. The movie is pure fun escapism, especially in this age with caller ID.
 This is the second movie Joan did for director Herman Cohen; the first was 1964's ""Straight Jacket""; that film is better than ""I Saw What You Did', but this film has more than enough campy Joan Crawford scenes to fulfill all Crawford enthusiasts. Joan is also reunited with her ""Queen Bee"" co-star and real-life former lover John Ireland. I also must add Miss Crawford looks beautiful in this. She was 61 years old when she shot this film, but looks breathtaking! This was also the first film she did when she walked away from ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"".
 ""I Saw What You Did"" is long out-of-print, but the costs of these used DVD's are worth all the money that you spend on them. Sit back and enjoy a great 1960's film and watch Miss Crawford tear up the scenes as well as her co-stars!
 The trailer is also included in the set.",1246060800,,1235,4.431718061674009
1239720,5,B00000K0DO,"The DVD includes the original trailer as well as a brief promo that Vincent Castle did for the movie. ""I Saw What You Did"" shows what happens when you make too many prank phone calls! I love this movie because it's so funny. These kids in this film are so totally silly. And everyone was so polite. What's up with that? Were people really like this in the 1960's? As usual Joan was perfect. My favorite scene was the one where she went nuts on Libby and chased her all the way back to the car. It was so funny, I thought Joan was going to have a heart attack. Rock on.",1208217600,3,568,4.080357142857143
1239721,5,B00000K0DO,"This movie is really a great film for the Low Budget  films of Days gone by. Joan Crawford is in this, but just for a few fleeting moments. It's not her best acting gig, and she sure didn't get any awards for this film. I noticed that some people gave it only 1 star...I bet that these people are younger and don't remember our old phone systems and the simpler days of living. This movie will keep your attention, especially if you are a baby boomer or older, as you will remember all the pranks that we all used to do on the phone. The first time I ever saw this film, it scared the crap out of me! The out in the middle of nowhere house, the fog...Boy can I relate to that growing up in the country! This film is scary, without all the blood, gore and violence that you see in todays horror films! I highly recommend this film!",1183420800,,830,4.1234567901234565
1239722,2,B00000K0DO,"One of William Castle's later efforts. ""I Saw What You Did"" was made the year after the terrific ""Strait Jacket"", and also stars Joan Crawford. She must have got on well with Castle as this was a much smaller role, in what it is a less impressive movie all round. The film stars two teenage girls who have been left to babysit the much younger sister of one of them in a remote house. To relieve the boredom, the pair decide to make lots of prank calls, whispering the movie's title down the telephone to lots of random people they pick out of the phone book. Trouble is, one of their victims really DID do something - he just murdered his wife! And once the call has been made, he decides he has to act fast and remove any potential witness.

Now, on paper this all sounds like it has the potential to make a really suspenseful and exciting movie. But for some reason, Castle sabotages the atmosphere by seemingly directing it for an audience about the same age as his two girl stars. Right from the opening credits, swinging beat music blares out over shots of the two friends gossiping over the phone, followed by nearly half an hour of cutesy family orientated comedy-melodrama. It's a problem shared by the original ""13 Ghosts"", in which a similarly spooky setting was spoiled by the irritatingly humerous sparring of the happy family involved. Why does Castle do this, when he's showed he has the know-how for creating real suspense if he wants to? My only guess is that a hard-hitting, adult film about a murderer terrorising two teenagers is not what Castle felt comfortable making here. But if that is the case, why is the film (and Castle's whole career) marketed at ""scaring the pants off America"" (to quote his autobiography)? He managed to make ""Strait Jacket"", ""The Tingler"" and ""Homicidal"" pretty effective, but he really drops the ball here.

Which is a shame, because in places, the film shines. The main murder, which leads to all the trouble, is a knockout. Although it's totally stolen from ""Psycho"" (it takes place in a shower), the roles of killer and victim are cleverly reversed, and it is short, sharp and surprisingly brutal. But once this is over, the plot really creaks as the machinations of the phone call and the murderer's discovery of who made it get awkwardly spun out on the screen. The script makes a real meal of setting up the drama... I'm sure they didn't need to make it quite this complicated, with lots of phoning, scheming and re-phoning going on. As a result, it takes forever for the film to reach it's climax in which the murderer finally starts terrorising the teenagers at their home, but when it does, there's some more real tension as he breaks in and starts his chase. I won't reveal the climax, but after it, as the film comes to a close, it's all ruined with a stupidly jaunty burst of music and some unbelievably inappropriate merriment (along the lines of ""That's the last crank call I'll ever make - ha ha!""), which wipes out the whole dark mood of the preceding 15 minutes. Unforgiveable.

So I was disappointed. Shame really, as the two girls playing the lead roles make good work as the giggly teenagers - not too annoying, and turning realistically scared when things become nasty. Even the little sister isn't bad. Castle must really like working with children, as all his child actors seem pretty relaxed and natural to me. Joan Crawford also makes an impact, in a very small role that she's really acting too well for. It's worth re-watching just the scenes she is again a second time. And there are brief moments of very good suspense. But basically, this could be a film aimed at kids about the perils of making prank calls, in fact if you took out the rather graphic (in this context, anyway) shower murder scene, it would be little more than a piece of Saturday morning matinee fluff.",1150675200,5,3851,4.618978102189781
1239723,4,B00000K0DO,"William Castle's B thriller is very suspenseful and ideal for dark, late Saturday night viewing. Top-billed Joan Crawford is dressed glamorously throughout, although her character barely makes it half way through the picture. It's also rather obvious that she came directly from ""Strait-Jacket"", and this would cement her as a camp icon. Of course, you can't help but think, ""Mommie Dearest, I promise I'll be good!""

Two teenage girls (Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane) bored on a Saturday night, decide to make prank phone calls (oh, those glory days before caller ID!), and use the interpretive phrase, ""I saw what you did - and I know who you are!"" Be careful how you dial, girls, because macho psychopath John Ireland has just brutally murdered his young wife (while he was taking a shower, no less - ""Psycho"" parallels, anyone?), and thinks you saw him do the dastardly deed. And, in good old psycho killer fashion, he will do anything to silence any alleged witnesses.

Although it's unmistakably el cheapo camp, Castle's gimmicky trademark, it's a nail-biting ride, and when it comes down to it, just a fun scarefest! Don't touch the phone, don't answer the door, don't go off on your own to meet your mystery guy, and don't live out in the middle of nowhere with no place to run!

And don't try to steal Joan's man - she'll be ridding your closet of wire hangers!

1239724,5,B00000K0DO,"This has got to be one of the most underrated suspense films ever!  William Castle's ""I Saw What You Did"" has all the classic elements that are later seen in films such as ""When A Stranger Calls"" and John Carpenter's ""Halloween.""  Two teenage girls, and one mischievous kid sister, spend an evening alone while the parents of one of the girls, are away on a dinner date.  A game of prank phone calls involving the girls using the line, ""I know who you are and I saw what you did,"" gets some laughs at first.  But then they call a man who has just committed a murder, and the game becomes deadly.  Great performances from the entire cast, including the Queen of Camp Joan Crawford!  I'd love to see this movie get a fresh dvd release, and even be included in a William Castle boxed set with some of his other great films, ""Mr. Sardonicus,"" ""The Night Walker,"" ""Strait-Jacket,"" and ""Macabre.""

Left alone one night while their parents are out of town, teen-aged Libby, her little sister Tess, and Libby's visiting friend Kit amuse themselves by making crank phone calls. They especially enjoy crooning ""I saw what you did and I know who you are"" to their victims. Unfortunately, one of their calls hits the bullseye--a homicidal maniac who has just murdered his wife. Tense and atmospheric, with delightful performances from Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke as the kids, and strong ones from John Ireland as the psychopath, and the one-and-only Joan Crawford (straight from Castle's ""Strait-Jacket"") as his blackmail-minded neighbor. The 1988 television remake is terrible. Avoid it and stick with the original! [phillindholm]",1134777600,4,916,5.238095238095238

Somehow, I do not want to give away too much, he finds out where they live and goes to get them. The movie is a little slow but quite entertaining. Joan of course camps it up as a desperate bitch.

Unfortunately it leads to the path of a psychotic killer played by John Ireland. Joan Crawford loves him, and is to the point of total possession of him. He just murdered his wife, and Joan is out for her man even to the point of blackmail. He ends up murdering Joan too, and now to meet the girl who called him, and a intense confrontation in which life and death hang in the fog, and the balance.

1239728,4,B00000K0DO,"William Castle (the movie ""gimmick-meister"") brought to the screen in July of 1965 a film entitled ""I Saw What You Did"", starring an aging Joan Crawford (who was 60).  This was one of Joan's last pictures, and she proves here she still had what it takes (albeit, in this film, in a somewhat humorous and over-the-top fashion).

The premise of this movie is a clever one -- two teenaged girls begin playing a telephone game, where they call people at random out of the phone book and inform them ""I saw what you did ... and I know who you are!""

This game takes a realistic twist when (as fate would have it) one of the ""victims"" of the girls' prank turns out to have committed a murder just minutes before the call.  A dangerous game indeed.

The two young girls are played by Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane.  They aren't exactly in Miss Crawford's class, acting-wise, but I liked both of them in this movie very much.  They just seemed to have a ""real"" quality to them that came through on screen.  Interestingly, this was Andi Garrett's only film appearance ever. And Sarah Lane appeared in just three other films besides this one.

Anchor Bay and Universal give us this black-and-white film on DVD in a good-looking Widescreen presentation (1.78:1), with a robust-enough Mono soundtrack.  The transfer here is not ""Anamorphic"", but it looks like one nonetheless, displaying a very clear picture with little in the way of any video distractions.

Not many, but a few, Bonus Features occupy space on this one-disc DVD edition. There's the Original Trailer for the film, plus a ""Teaser Trailer"", which features Director William Castle's ""World Premiere Announcement"" for this little chiller/thriller.

Also on the disc are some text-only ""Talent Bios"" (for Crawford and Castle).  The Bio section for Miss Crawford is very nice, too -- featuring a multitude of text screens covering her vast career. Many vintage photos of the actress are also included on the bio text screens.

A one-page (two-sided) insert comes in this Keepcased package.  This is one of the nicer single-page DVD enclosures, being made from a thicker cardboard than most flimsier paper inserts. A listing of the movie's 20 ""Chapters"" is on one side; while a reproduction of an original lobby card (or poster) for the film is shown on the other side of the insert.

""I Saw What You Did"" certainly isn't the best or scariest flick you'll ever see.  But it has a certain atmospheric charm to it that definitely places it in the ""worth a look"" category.",1085356800,5,2516,4.773672055427252
1239729,3,B00000K0DO,"I think this movie had potential to be a good little thriller, but the mood gets spoiled too often by the teeny-booper music. Yes, we get it, the movie's about misbehaving teenagers. You don't need to bust out the American Bandstand music every time they appear on screen.
That may seem like a minor quibble, but I found the inappropriate music did have an effect on the suspense, which got dialed up pretty high in certain scenes. Just when I thought things were coming to a close, there was another little twist, and danger reared its ugly head once again. The happy ending was kind of predictable, but the path to get there was often full of surprises.
I watched the movie first and foremost as a Joan Crawford fan, although I understood going into it that she had a small part and overacted it, at that. (I never saw anyone fall to the floor in such an elaborate fashion.) It's a shame that they'll release films like this on DVD, but not more of Crawford's earlier, better work.

1239730,5,B00000K0DO,"Having seen most of William Castle's films, the only few problems i had with ""I Saw What You Did"" mainly go to a few technicals. By 1965, you would think that Castle would have filmed this in color. That was one problem. Another, the soundtrack. I can understand that the beginning of some horror films can be rather up-beat with the premise of setting the audience up for a twist that ultimately takes us for a ride. The soundtrack for this film doesn't let up, and actually sounds like music for a ""Beach Party"" film. With that aside, everyone knows that Castle did his best with what he knew. The acting is at times corny, but it was intended that way for the sake of getting the best reaction from the audience when some scenes were 'off the cuff'. The shower scene at the beginning is where i have the most praise. Castle's ability to give us a small bloodbath (remember ""Homicidal""?) MADE me buy the dvd for that one scene. Other than that, Joan Crawford's role was good, and Castle's re-use of some of the actor's from his previous films was ok. The extra's were a nice bonus, tho a doccumentary with some of the actor's would have been interesting to watch.",1062201600,4,1165,4.474178403755869
1239731,5,B00000K0DO,"Another clinker from the 1960's vault of Joan Crawford films. & of course, Joan being a true star really gives it her all in this truly bad low-budget film about 2 silly teenagers who make a prank call to the wrong guy (John Ireland). Her brief (& co-starring) appearance steals the show & as usual is a riot. The subplot involves Joan playing the desperate, manipulating, man-hungry middle aged next door neighbor--who is obsessed w/ snagging John Ireland even AFTER she finds out he's a murderer! The scenes w/ her & John Ireland together where she can barely surpress her jealous rage over his dead ex-girlfriend had me chuckling. Dressed in what looks like a cocktail dress & a mini-chandellier around her neck, she looks & sounds as if perhaps there really was alcohol in those drinks she was making. The climax comes when she confronts one of the teen-aged girls grabbing her by the hair, calling her a ""tramp"" & ripping her to shreds screaming ""GET OUTTA HERE!..."" over & over again.  you'll die laughing. The rest of the film has some suspenseful moments thanks to the menacing John Ireland, but the corny soundtrack music took what little scariness this film had going for it away. At times it sounded like background music on an episode of ""The Flintstones"". I'm sure this may have been scary stuff for pre-teens in the 60's but today its just another hilariously campy Joan Crawford movie.& i'm giving this film ***** simply because it completely fulfilled my need for camp--Joan Crawford style.",1038268800,5,1506,4.814671814671815

Two images that will FOREVER stay in my mind are when the killer is looking in the window and the girl sees him in a mirror...and then when she's trying to start the car...oh my goodness!  I have not seen the DVD, but had purchased the video.  It is much easier to watch now, but that scene of him peeking in the window still weirds me out!!

1239733,4,B00000K0DO,"I've never been a big fan of William Castle, even as a Baby Boomer kid.  The first Castle directed film I saw was ""Macabre,"" which didn't do a thing for me. Then came ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Tingler."" I could tolerate those, because they starred my favorite horror icon, Vincent Price. HOUSE, especially, is a great Price showcase, and I love it to this day. In the 60's, Castle became quite enamored with Hitchcock's PSYCHO and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" which led to ""Straight Jacket"" (combining the talents of Psycho scribe Robert Bloch and Jane vet Joan Crawford). Crawford followed up with still another Castle endeavor, I SAW WHAT YOU DID. Hmmm...how do I say this delicately? Ok, the honest approach is always best.  I SAW WHAT YOU DID is awful! First of all, it was filmed in or around 1965 and looks like an extended episode of ""Leave it to Beaver."" The two teenage leads are completely and utterly unbelievable--they make Frankie and Annette look like Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh! So sticky sweet and ""cute,"" in that bouncy, teenage sitcom way (just like all the kids on Beaver and the Donna Reed Show). And the soundtrack! (shudder!) Take a pop record, circa 1965, remove the vocals, and that's what they used. I can't describe it in words, except to say the theme song to ""The Patty Duke Show"" would've fit in perfectly! Ok, now for the plot: teenage ditzes Libby and her girlfriend decide to have a wild night by pranking people on the telephone. Woooo! Outrageous!  How can they be so daring? They call names randomly from the phone book, saying ""I saw what you did, and I know who you are."" Hilarious, right? Well, these two bubbleheads happen to connect with a man who's just butchered his wife. Guess the rest--go on, you can do it! Joan Crawford has a totally thankless role as a busybody neighbor of the killer (Joan Ireland, looking dour). She's had the hots for him for years, it seems, and is always either looking out her window at him, looking through his window at him, or knocking on his door. The most hilarious scene in I SAW WHAT YOU DID is when Libby shows up at Ireland's house (don't ask how or why--it's beyond logic) and encounters an angry Joan, who's skulking in the shrubbery. Joan grabs the girl's hair and shrieks ""Gedoudda here!"" Not only once, but three times! And while she's doing this, her own hairpiece is coming undone!  And what the heck was that thing around Joan's neck? The most god-awful necklace--it must've weighed a ton!  I wish I could say I SAW WHAT YOU DID was suspenseful. Alas, all it did was make me wonder why I purchased this DVD!  Oh, yeah, quality-wise, the DVD is great. There are some nice extras, too...but the film is painful to watch. Nice premise, poorly done, and coated with so much sugar, my teeth ache!  Give me Leave it to Beaver anyday...at least the laugh track tells me when something's supposed to be funny!",1017705600,3,2908,4.613152804642167
1239734,1,B00000K0DO,"To the point - After making this film, Joan made Berserk and Trog before she moved on to tv films.'I saw what you did' is pretty horrible film with a flimsy story line. The only saving grace is the brief moments of Joan,still glamous and every inch a STAR.

7913999,3,B00000K0DO,"Top-billed Joan Crawford has only a few scenes in this suspense film about two bored teenage girls making prank  telephone calls and inadvertantly exposing a murderer who sets out to hunt them down. The two young actresses have not worked again to my knowledge and John Ireland, who had a long, largely ""B"" career, looks like a decrepit nerd in this which may work to the film's advantage. His ancient bewigged girlfriend is played powerfully by Joan. She looks diminutive here except for her Mount Rushmore face and Empire State Building wig. One of her best moments is confronting one of the two prank callers whom she mistakenly thinks is having an affair with the haggard and very resistible Ireland. Otherwise her role is redundant but without her this film has limited entertainment value. A good if unoriginal premise boringly handled. Thank God for Miss Crawford.",1391385600,,871,4.965753424657534
7914000,4,B00000K0DO,I loved this movie!  Two teens babysitting are truly caught up in something really bad and the way they get involved is not frustratingly contrived like most movies.  I loved it then and I still love it now :-0,1387929600,3,210,4.358974358974359
7914001,2,B00000K0DO,"This film is quite simply one of the worst ever made (Certainly William Castle's worst...Eat your heart out Ed Wood !)
There IS a genuinely disturbing murder scene, almost worthy of Hitchcock. Although it too takes place in a shower, it is far from being a crib of the famous scene in PSYCHO. It is an authentic surprise and shock. That is however, virtually the only effective moment in the whole film.
It founders on several things. Joan Crawford as a nosy neighbor with romantic designs on the killer could not be more absurdly coiffed and bejeweled. She chews every piece of scenery in sight !  Her every appearance is literally laughable. The two young teen aged actresses whose prank phone calls precipitate the plot are just awful, and the little girl who is being babysat is truly annoying and not at all talented.
John Ireland is not half bad as the killer.
The very worst of it is the musical score. An effective minor key or atonal score could have done much to help mood and atmosphere. We get a weak Rock and Roll/Jazz mishmash that scarcely matches the visuals for a single scene.
Skip it ! This is 90 some minutes of your life you can never get back !!!",1373241600,,1168,4.509433962264151

Then the movie was on t.v. and I saw it for the first time.....absolutely one of the top 5 Worst movies I've ever seen. I love Joan Crawford and have dozens of her movies, but this is a FLOP! Throughout the whole movie I kept saying to myself, ""Why are you still watching this...?"" It is just plain bad.",1371513600,,434,4.0
7914003,1,B00000K0DO,"Obviously not.

The only reason why people watch this movie is for 1) Joan Crawford and 2) a pretty good premise that falls flat.

And oh yes, the untalented youngsters.

We all know the story, so I won't comment on it.  It's a good idea, yes, but.....

Well, anyway, Joan Crawford as a )slightly drunk, maybe?) woman having an affair with a man who just killed his wife.  Her hair is THIS TALL and her necklace must be THIS HEAVY and for a woman who prided herself on her appearance at all times this film must have come as a wake-up call when she finally saw it.

She looks and acts horribly.  She is a mess.  Sad to see her like this and yet, for some reason, it is precisely this performance (and a few others) that excite reviewers into giving films like this more stars than they deserve.",1367971200,,794,4.275167785234899
7914004,5,B00000K0DO,Luckily I saw this in the theatre. Really scared me with the girls pursued by a murderer. Joan Crawford dominates all the scenes she is in ! John Ireland provides able support.  Two scenes especially scared me when the suspense builds up more and more. Try this film you will like it. A B film but very well done.,1361577600,,313,4.305084745762712
