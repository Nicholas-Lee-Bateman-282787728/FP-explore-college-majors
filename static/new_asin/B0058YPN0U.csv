4603572,5,B0058YPN0U,"So I am aware that posting reviews on these DC Warner Premiere titles is risky or precarious at best. The fans are quite knowledgeable and while some don't want a fluff review others are full of adoration for their favorite characters and want reviews that only say positive things. Having had the privelege to obtain and view the film a week before its planned release I am going to attempt to review the actual overall quality for those who are uncertain about making this purchase. While all opinions are obviously subjective I will try to state facts and point out any statements that are based more on my opinion to allow each individual to decide for themself.

Adaptation/Story: Overall this is an excellent adaptation, 10/10. The film follows the exact plot of the original Frank Miller graphic novel, and as has been stated in interviews with Bruce Timm and others, it doesn't leave any scenes out but some are added/very slightly rearranged. The added scenes, in my opinion, don't feel out of place. They are in tone with the original material and are also kept few and far between. Certain monologues/inner dialogues have been slightly changed or shortened but the essence of each is kept true to the source material. The story, needless to say, is fantastic and establishes Batman in a dark gritty world of realism, pure genius on the part of Frank Miller.

Note: Only a rewording of Bruce Wayne's opening monologue felt pointless to me, rather than saying he should've taken the train to be closer to the enemy he says from the plane he can't see the enemy. I feel his desire to be near the enemy was better felt with the original line. Sorry to nitpick.

Animation: Stunning 9/10. It is clean and crisp, which may seem contradictory to my next statement, they perfectly capture Mazzucchelli's gritty and realistic artwork and clearly let it drive the art direction of the film. It is well directed, with nearly every shot and design taken right from the graphic novel and having been brought to life, though Jim Gordon's jawline has been made slightly more defined. There is a wide array of fantastic color selection but still a muted tone that recalls the look of the graphic novel.

That said, my own personal preference for the fluid style of animation I was raised on (BTAS for example) leaves me feeling newer DC features often have a stiff/static feel to their animation no matter how beautiful it is, which is sometimes the case here. I've never been sure if this comes from intention in design, trying to emulate certain anime styles or if it has to do with budgetary constraints. In any case it isn't an issue for most and detracts little to nothing from the beauty and style of the animation. (For an example see the scene where Bruce Wayne kicks over the tree and how it falls over).

Voice Acting: Well done, 8/10 overall.

Eliza Dushku seems an odd choice to me to play this version of Catwoman as she is caucasian and here Selina Kyle is African American. At the same time this happens a lot in animation and her voice work suits the character and brings real emotion, attitude and strength to the character. She is able to flesh out the character surprisingly well given a short amount of screen time.

Bryan Cranston plays Jim Gordon. I am bias here as I am a huge fan of Cranston and his recent work on Breaking Bad, but I find him to portray Gordon as a relatable and likable man who is tough yet tired. Any occassional stiffness in his inner dialogues seems to be an intentional direction given by Andrea Romano and is faintly noticed at best.

Ben Mckenzie plays Bruce Wayne/Batman. I admit to being a fan of Mckenzie from my younger years watching The OC, but here I feel his voice seems out of place and somewhat forced, that's where voice acting loses points. It doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the film as a whole, and will likely grow on me over future viewings but his inner dialogues and monologues play very stale, especially the robotic opening dialogue, which had me concerned for the rest of the feature, but thankfully it levelled out as the film progressed and became more tolerable. The stiffness again seems to be partly an intentional choice but I feel a little more emotion could have been injected without risking oversentimentality.

Other voice actors do phenomenal work, Jeff Bennett and Grey Delisle are old pros while Katie Sackhoff and Jon Polito fit well into their characters. The only other misuse of voice besides Mckenzie, in my opinion, was Alex Rocco as Falcone/The Roman. I enjoy Rocco's voiceover on other series but he felt more like the voice of a thug than the boss of a high profile crime family.

Sound: 10/10. The score is used well and sparingly. This world is immersive and the sound effects are all realistic and chosen to enhance that immersive feeling. The final credits are amazing and really left me on a high, I hope all future titles incorporate panels from the source material into their closing credits, simply fantastic. The score over the final credits was also well done, a moody rock ballad, it felt like a Batman theme but was also reminiscent of the late 80's style, the era the story was first published and seems to be set in.

So overall I don't want to make this any longer than it has to be. It is a faithful adaptation, probably for my money the most faithfaul adaptation DC/Warner Premiere have done so far. I am bias as a huge Bat-fan but I place this and Batman: Under the Red Hood [Blu-ray] as the two best films so far, with Justice League: The New Frontier Special Edition [Blu-ray] coming in third. I would actually place this one above Red Hood only because I admire Frank Miller's story so much and find the world created to be so much more distinct and layered. With only 64 minutes of runtime this is a short film but an immersive one that merits repeat viewings, for me anyways.

I'll leave each reader up to their own decision based on this information but I say this is worth the money for fans of Batman or for fans of Frank Miller. Even better if you are a fan of both. I'm glad this time I wasn't disappointed. I also know that some question why so many of these releases have to feature Batman, why not some other DC heroes, but after seeing Year One pulled off this well I am personally hoping they attempt Batman: The Long Halloween in the near future.

Amazon's rating system is flawed, based on their five star system I love this film and give it 5 stars, if this was a rating out of 10 I would give an overall 9/10.",1318377600,3,6531,4.586118251928021

**For those, like myself, who once thought titles like The Long Halloween were an impossibility without butchering them for length there seems to be new hope. The upcoming adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns will be a two part production.

4603767,5,B0058YPN0U,"I saw this movie after reading the graphic novel (also titled at ""Batman Year One""). After seeing the movie, I would imagine that fans of the comic will appreciate this movie more than those who have not read it. To keep it brief, if you even slightly willing in cracking open a Batman comic, I highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.

As a movie, this movies rather slowly. For those who are new to Batman Year One, you may be slightly disappointed if you are expecting fast pace action scenes with Batman. Most of the story is told through imagery and inner monologs which are all familiar to the comic. The story is a bit dramatic and dark.

This follows Police Officer James Gordon, who has been transferred to Gotham City. In this new life he deals with a troubled city, a corrupt police force, and marriage issues. (The story may be titled after Batman, but James Gordon is the main focus of this story). Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (Batman) has arrived back to his home in Gotham (after year of combat training). At the beginning, he struggles at to satisfy his thirst for avenging his parent's death. He later perfects his oath as a crime fighter by becoming Batman. But, becoming Batman isn't his only obstacle. He also deals with evading the Gotham City's police, who only see him as a vigilante/trouble maker. Overall, highly recommend this ESPECIALLY if you a fan of the book (I cant stress this enough). Sorry for alienating everyone else, but you may find some enjoyment in it without reading the book.",1464739200,,1530,4.662962962962963

4603893,5,B0058YPN0U,"I am not a Batman devotee, so I can't get too esoteric here, but I can say that I enjoyed this animated flick very much.  I will probably go back and watch it many times. Early on, I was thinking that the James Gordon character was too one-dimensional, too much of a straight arrow... ""Who wants gum?"" he asks some kids he just saved from a criminal goon. I was getting worried, but then, later, the movie, and Gordon, too, gets pretty damn twisted and dark. This story is cool, because it follows Gordon's beginnings in Gotham, along with Bruce Wayne's emergence as Batman. Also, the CatWoman short that is included in this package is completely wonderful, in a PG-13 kind of way (but I wish they had gone R with it).  I checked out the credits and watched the included documentary, and then I was amazed to see that Frank Miller (Sin City) had written the story (graphic novel/comic book) for this. Cool. I love Frank Miller; I'd like to get more animated stuff that has this same kind of noir tone to it, so I'd be open to any recommendations, either in the Batman area, or in the general animated noir genre. Hey, I told you I'm not a Batman expert.",1458086400,4,1153,4.408450704225352
4603894,3,B0058YPN0U,"I decided to take another look at Batman: Year One with a more objective eye to see how it holds up against other Batman works, including the other animated DC features. Sadly, it does not hold up as well as I would like it to. In fact, compared to a lot of other stories that feature Batman, this one is surprisingly dull.
 Batman: Year One is the adaptation of the comic story of the same name, written by Frank Miller back in 1987. Yeah, THAT Frank Miller. This is one of is earlier Batman stories, and since he considers everything Batman hes ever written to be in the same continuity, this is the first entry in the Dark Knight universe, and the only story in that continuity to remain canonical to the greater mainstream DC Universe. Dont worry too much though; this was back when his Batman work was fairly good more often than it was bad. However, even his good Batman work has what I consider to be narrative problems.
 This story, as you could guess from the title, tells of Bruce Waynes first year after returning from his worldwide training quest to become Gothams greatest crimefighter, and when he soon adopts the mantle of the Batman. Along with Bruce, we see Jim Gordon, the future Commissioner of Gotham City PD, in his first year on the force. This film does a good job of showing how bad the crime, and even worse, the corruption of Gotham City really is. We see the kind of filth that would create Batman, before Batman himself lent to the creation of supervillains. If anything, this is much more like what the TV show Gotham should be. It does tell its story rather competently. The problem is that the story itself is rather dull. Without the villains for Batman to fight, hes just stuck with thugs and corrupt cops, which he handles easily. There isn't even much resolution; it just sort of stops. The criminals are barely dealt with, showing the weakness of the system, and there really isn't even much of a climax.
 Also, there are some narrative choices that I don't think mesh with the characters as we will come to know them later. Gordon cheats on his pregnant wife with someone who is fully aware of the situation. Gordon would not be that callous, or do something that despicable. Hes supposed to be the one good man on the force, who cleans up the GCPD and inspires the other cops to be better and more upstanding people. An adulterer cant be on the moral high ground like that. And Selina Kyle, Catwoman, starts as a prostitute. Ignoring how Miller usually writes women as prostitutes, this sullies her later relationships and reluctant moral center. Yes, these plot points are taken from the comic, but that does not automatically make them good. Also, the noir-style inner monologuing does get grating after a little while.
 Adding to the dullness of the film is the voice acting. Bryan Cranston does okay as Jim Gordon. He would do just as well in live action. Shame he probably won't get the opportunity. Ben McKenzie, on the other hand, does a very disinterested and unemotional Bruce Wayne/Batman. I guess he does a better Jim Gordon, but not by much. Eliza Dushku does a similarly boring Selina Kyle/Catwoman. The problem is that nobody is really given any kind of emotional range, except maybe when Selina gets a little pissy about not getting credit as Catwoman. Other than that, neither Batman nor anybody for that matter can get animated enough to put real effort into their voice roles.
 Overall, I would say that this Batman story does competently, but does not excite by any means. I am more excited to see how Batman evolves rather than how he came to be.",1457827200,,3604,4.607476635514018

I love Ben McKenzie on Gotham as Jim Gordon, but he turns in an awful performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. In his defense, the writers didn't do him any favors. His monologues are some of the worst pieces of dialog I've ever heard in a professional film.

So overall its a terribly written film with some terrible acting. The animation and direction were nothing to write home about either. I strongly suggest you find something else to watch. If you're a Batman fan you probably won't listen, but once you're done you'll regret watching it. Go watch some good Batman, like Under the Red Hood.",1452902400,2,817,4.627586206896551

4604020,4,B0058YPN0U,"Before embarking on doing their 2-parter of The Dark Knight Returns, DC Universe decided to test the waters with Frank Miller's post-Crisis origin story of Batman: Year One. This was an canon telling of Batman's beginnings during his first year of operating as a masked manhunter. A lot of material from the original comic was later used for other adaptations like Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and largely in Batman Begins, so if you've seen those already, it there aren't a lot of surprises on his end, but it's more about how Gotham City adapts to this new player in town, including the new police lieutenant.

 After 12 years of training abroad, Bruce Wayne finally returns home to fight crime on his own terms, but James Gordon is also transferring to Gotham as an addition to the police department. Gordon starts rattling some internal cages as he realizes a lot of the city officials are on the take of the mob boss, Carmine Falcone. Bruce Wayne first tries out taking out some thugs wearing just a ski mask, but after getting beaten badly, he realizes he needs an edge over them. By way of possible providence, a bruised Bruce gets his answer as a large bat just happens to break through the window to his study, giving him the idea to take on the persona of Batman. This new vigilante starts causing problems for the mafia, and the police under their thumb, leading Gordon to take on a the assistance of the lovely Detective Essen, who he succumbs to having a brief affair with while his wife Barbara is pregnant with their first child. While out hunting for Batman, Gordon and Essen track Batman down after he saved a woman from getting run over. The SWAT team corners Batman in an abandoned building, so he uses a special sonic device that leads thousands of bats from the Batcave to downtown, and he escapes during the chaos. While this is going on, Selina Kyle is a prostitute that takes on the masked identity of Catwoman who decides to make a name for herself by scarring Falcone. The Don doesn't take this well, and has his nephew take his hatred out on Gordon by having him kidnap his wife and newborn son. An unmasked Bruce Wayne rushes to save them, leaving Gordon to trust this new vigilante, although not clearly showing he might now who he really is.

 Also included in this is a short of Catwoman similar to the DC Showcase features which acts as a follow-up to Year One. Set sometime later, Catwoman is an established cat burgler and anti-hero who learns of a slave trade being conducted by gang leader Rough Cut(who supposedly was made up just for this short). After fooling him and his cronies that she was just another stripper at a nightclub, Catwoman follows Rough Cut to his warehouse, and causes him to have an epic crash into his boat, and she frees her old hooker friend Holly. There's a different style to this than from the main movie and it was mainly done to help pad out the movie for online broadcast as its only a little over an hour long, but still very worth it.

Year One makes for a definitive watch for any Batfan, although totally not for kids with all the serious adult situations and violence. The animation is acceptable, but Dark Knight Returns seemed to capture Frank Miller's idea a little better. Keeping in mind that its more of the beginnings of Commissioner Gordon that it is about Batman himself, it is still a compelling mature crime story. Bryan Cranston does a fantastic job as Gordon, while future Gordon on the Gotham TV series Benjamin McKenzie plays an acceptable Batman, although Kevin Conroy is still tops in my book.",1440806400,,3582,4.608150470219436
4604021,4,B0058YPN0U,"A splendid animation, truly high quality. This is more of a Jim Gordon story than a Batman story, so don't be fooled.

This has very adult themes that I was surprised to see from the Comic book medium. A must-watch, for sure.",1440460800,,424,4.51948051948052

4604026,5,B0058YPN0U,"Batman fans who have seen Christopher Nolan's films will note how similar this story feels to Batman Begins, which owes a great debt to Year One as inspiration for Batman's motivations and techniques.  In both stories, Jim Gordon is the only honest cop in a Gotham based on mob-controlled Chicago, Batman triggers a swarm of bats to escape a confrontation, and Gotham's police generally don't know what to do about the sudden appearance of a masked vigilante.  Here, though, there are no bold entrances via Batmobile or terrorist plots to foil, so Batman is even more of an anti-hero than he is at any point in Nolan's trilogy.

However, Batman: Year One has a crucial advantage over the film adaptations: the focus on and development of Jim Gordon, arguably the deepest and most spellbinding character in the Batman mythos.  Here, Gordon is voiced by Bryan Cranston, who does incredible work with Frank Miller's dialog.  As much as I love Gary Oldman, I would not be upset to see Cranston step into the role in any future films or reboots.  The dynamic between Batman and Gordon - the slow recognition by each individual that the other shares their resolve and sense of purpose - establishes both characters in an extremely fulfilling way.  Batman, written by Miller, is more committed to vengeance than justice, and needs Gordon's commitment to the latter to keep him in check.  Built on this fascinating relationship, Batman: Year One is a great Batman story.",1438560000,,1462,4.890688259109312

The art style and animation is good and looks like the source material. I would say that the voice cast is probably the weakest of any of DC's movies though which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Even though I believe it covered everything in the source material, the movie felt too short. I wouldn't have minded if they had extended some scenes.

Bryan Cranston voices Gordon and he does a great job. Batman Begins was heavily influenced from Miller's Batman Year One novel as well and you will instantly see the connection once you see this or read the novel. The only thing I would have liked to have seen done differently is a more Gothic-fantasy looking Gotham City, but thats not the way Miller wanted to go with Gotham.",1394755200,,527,4.5

(I don't know why they left out the ""I shall become a bat"" line, but you can't have everything.)  What kills the film for me is, as other reviewers have mentioned, the voice actor for Batman/Bruce.  He's just terrible.  If they hired someone else, I might have given it 4 stars.

After spending many years abroad, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City to fulfill the vow to rid it of crime that he made to his deceased parents when he was a boy. At the same time, Chicago cop James Gordon moves to Gotham to start with the GCPD. Soon, Bruce adopts the identity of the Batman and makes war on Gothams crime families, with James Gordon hot on his tail as the cop tries to take down the vigilante crime fighter.

I love origin stories. The mythology of characters, their history, their motivations, the events leading up to the creation of a super identityall of its gold in my book. Batman: Year One is such a story, giving you not only Batmans origin, but the chance to walk a mile in his shoes during his first year as a crime fighter. You get to see him test the waters, make mistakes, have some wins and losses, and watch as he earns the trust of Gothams finest.

This movie is a down-to-earth story about Batman and James Gordon, very much a crime story versus a superhero-vs-supervillain tale. Batman deals with real world criminals in real world ways. You also get a glimpse into the hard life he leads, what he gives up to be Batman, and how he balances life as a fool in the public eye so he could be a fear to the criminal underworld at night.

You also get to see a different side of James Gordon, the marriage trouble, his humanity, and the plight of being a good cop in a bad town. His portrayal makes him every bit a hero as Batman in this story.

This flick is based on the one-shot comic book by comics superstar Frank Millar and matches the books style for the most part, really bringing it to life.

This is a story of beginnings so the pacing is different than what most people are used to, and instead of having a beginning, middle, big lead up to a climax then end, it hasto me, anywaymore of a beginning, middle and then part of an end because its really a prequel to all the other Batman stories that come after it. Which is fine. It works, but I remember going, Is that it? when it ended after I first watched it.

Im glad that Batmans first year was brought to the small screen and I hope more first year stories are made for other heroes. Superman next would be great.

4604456,5,B0058YPN0U,"BATMAN: YEAR ONE continues the tradition of excellence in DC animated films and series; their direct-to-DVD films are usually excellent adaptations or re-tellings of classic story lines. YEAR ONE is especially faithful to Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli book of the same title. The creative team grabs images, character designs, and dialog directly from he graphic novels pages. My favorite thing about YEAR ONE has to be Jim Gordon. It's as much his story as Batman's since its also his first year on the corrupt Gotham Police force. There are many shades of Serpico here; except the fictional Jim Gordon is allowed to become a hero cop getting the media and public on his side much sooner than the disillusioned Frank Serpico. Gordon is a straight out Supercop. Its also a great reminder of just how inspirational this tale was to Christopher Nolan. if your a fan of those Batman films, check out the source material- written or animated.

I'm not one of these people who goes into any and every Batman movie and/or cartoon thinking it will be a kids' movie, so adult Batman fans out there, I'm not reviewing it based on strong language or adult themes being inappropriate for kids. I have read so many poor reviews where this is all that is talked about. There were only a few instances of strong language. About the same as most any movie these days. And I don't consider Batman really for kids. I'm giving it a poor review because it simply isn't really a good movie. It was kind of...well, stupid. The film is based more around Jim Gordon. He's a likeable character, but not in doses like that. And bottom line, while I may not have a problem with Gordon and following his story arc, come on, it's Batman I care about. If you're a Batman fanatic like me, but aren't so obsessed with owning everything Batman that you buy the bad stuff, give this a one-time rental for curiosities' sake, and that's it.

4604484,3,B0058YPN0U,"The animation of the movie is well done, and it instills a muted color scheme that captures the older time period perfectly. The voice acting is well done, and the script is faithful to the original graphic novel (so far as I can remember). The problem with this movie, and the reason I only rate it three stars (which means ""okay""), is that in the context of a Batman origin story, it's unfortunately boring (not to mention uninformative).

It's perhaps unfair to compare Year One to Batman Begins, but since the latter movie has become so popular, the comparison is just. When it comes to Batman's origins, most people (particularly those under the age of 40 or so), will think of Christopher Nolan's Bat movies. Whereas Batman Begins thoroughly explores Bruce Wayne's training and motivations, Year One does very little- Batman just appears, with the sudden ability to kick through trees with two-foot diameters (which, if you want to nitpick, would require Superman-style strength!).

Old school Batman fans may delight in this movie and its slower pace, but younger fans may find their attention wandering. I'm somewhat in the middle of those two demographics, and I was not entertained. However, that is not a negative criticism of the writer's original graphic novel- it was excellent for its time. Christopher Nolan (and brother) had the benefit of twenty years hindsight and writing evolution in order to craft their superior origin story.",1363651200,6,1448,5.029166666666667

It was the second best Batman story ever told, next only to The Dark Knight Returns, which came out only two years prior.  Both books were written by Frank Miller.
These were Frank Miller's finest works at the time.  Of the many comic book writers I followed, Frank Miller was by far my favorite.  He was the most brilliant storyteller of the medium, and his pencil art and use of colors were uniquely evocative as well.
The Batman Year One animation movie was a faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's book.  I would have been happier, though, if DC had instead made a full-length live-action movie for theatrical release.",1361750400,,993,4.533707865168539

As expected of any modern movie burned onto a blu-ray disc, the sound and image quality are superb. Not much to write here, since if you have watched a blu-ray movie on an HDTV before, you know what to expect. Crisp image quality, great sound clarity. No pixelation or artifacting to be found. Everything runs smoothly and is a delight for the senses.

This disc comes with a bunch of extra goodies. The Catwoman extra is pretty entertaining. Year One isn't particularly action-packed, not that it's supposed to be. In contrast to the great character development in the main feature, the Catwoman featurette is packed with action. The animation is top notch and the directing is very well done. I was kind of skeptical since I was expecting a half-baked extra tacked on just to entice audiences, but it was actually very entertaining and I certainly plan to watch it again if I feel like watching some awesome Catwoman action. The disc also comes with several interviews, which is always great to get some insight from big names who have worked with the Caped Crusader. If you are one to enjoy getting into the minds of the artists behind The Batman, then this will be a treat indeed. Plus there are two episodes from two different versions of Batman animated series. One is from the classic Batman: The Animated Series, and I forget what the other series was. Still, a great bonus that DC was humble enough to allow on the disc.

Overall, the I would highly recommend getting this film on blu-ray. You will want to see the art in as high a quality as possible. The art is beautiful and deserves the HD treatment. Plus, all of the bonus features will be enough to please any Batman fanboy/fangirl. And for the price you can get this on Amazon, it's well worth the 15-20ish dollars, depending on price fluctuations. Hell, this thing is worth more than that, if you ask me.

Jim Gordon Is new to Gotham just like the batman. Through out the movie you see batman and Jim Gordon make mistakes. This movie in my opinion was 3.5 out of 5 stars. The movie succeeds in making it like the graphic novel but honestly although it comes with a cool catwoman stripper cartoon, I just wish the bluray had more on it. For 7.99 plus 2.99 shipping handling is a good price for it though. Overall Batman Year One is an action cartoon movie thats a little too short for my taste. I love batman movies, almost all of them but Batman Year One isn't on top of that list. Sorry I'm not praising it but I'm giving you my opinion.",1359158400,,942,4.297752808988764
4604536,5,B0058YPN0U,I also bought this Batman animated movie as a Christmas present for my husband too.  He has been eyeing it in the store and has always enjoyed the animated Batman movies.  I got it for a good price on Amazon and he was very happy with recieving this item.  We haven't watched it yet so I cannot comment on the picture or sound quality but this story does follow the comic book version of how Batman became the vigilantia with a darker flavor to it.  At lease that is what the other reviewers described this animated Batman tale.  The packaging is really nice and it's really cool that it does include a short film of Catwomen too.  The price is such a good deal and it is defiently worth adding to your Batman animated collection.,1358985600,,730,4.37037037037037

4604558,1,B0058YPN0U,"Now before you instinctively click 'NO' on the ""was this review helpful"", please understand I am not some no0b. I read Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" years ago, and thought it... ok. Certainly nowhere near as fantastic as the ""Dark Night Returns"", (but how does one top that anyway?) I am not criticizing Miller's work, nor the decision to ""animate"" it. I am complaining about the heart and soul of this ""movie"", because it doesn't have either.

While the ""movie"" (64 minutes barely qualifies as a movie) does remain technically faithful to the images & dialog of the original series of comics, somehow the director/producers/actors manage to drain every, last, drop, of entertainment OUT of this thing before ever handing it over to underpaid/overworked/talentless Korean animators.

The animation is standard Saturday morning lack-of-quality. The actors must have been just reading the script out-loud without realizing they were being recorded, as they sure weren't ""acting"", more like they were just reciting the alphabet. I know they were in a small soundproof box, but for goddess sake, when Selina Kyle insults her sub/john with the explanation that the reason why she hates men is that she's ""Never met one"", it should have been delivered with scathing disdain & sarcasm, not with the voice of someone ordering Chinese food!

I blame a director & producer who probably never read a comic book in their life. Oh, they took the script word-for-word (beats having to pay a writer) but showed zero understanding of the story's nuances.

Rent it, or wait for it to show up on the cartoon network at night.",1358294400,5,1605,5.022556390977444

The voice actor for Batman/Bruce Wayne didn't feel right either.

4604560,5,B0058YPN0U,"You know, I grew up on Batman and Superman comics and always leaned toward Batman,(Let's face it-sometimes Superman really is a Boy Scout about some things! But when you're Super you can be!). I especially liked the Detective comics. They always had that dark intensity to them which is what I so enjoy in the last 3 Batman cinema movies and is what I think Batman really is all about. I think the animated movies are something Batman, and DC fans of the other Superheroes as well, are fortunate to have. If one is into storyline/plot delivered by good to great animation it's just as good as a movie. Let your imagination run amuck, which any reader knows how to do!
  Batman Year One though really delivers both, good graphics with a really good story. Thank You to you guys who are turning out these bonuses for us fans.

There are some minor differences between the film and source material, but anyone who gets hung up on that is really being. The animation is fantastic, and the artwork overall faithfully reproduces that of the comic. They do a great jobe of reproducing some of the comics most iconic scenes and images. I loved seeing Jim Gordon being portrayed as a determined and effective hero inn his own rite whoes presence is just as important a force to Batmans quest to restore order to Gotham as the Dark Knight himself.

It feels a bit short at just over an hour, but that is perhaps just being spoiled with todays seemingly requisite 2.5 + hr run time...

4604563,1,B0058YPN0U,"By Jove, Amazon, you have left me no choice. You see, I am trying to figure out if it is worth buying the two disc edition of Batman: Year One for twice the price of the one disc version, and I am finding that rather difficult since there is absolutely no difference in the product descriptions between the two. So I am doing something I normally consider obnoxious by giving this movie a one star rating it does not deserve, and writing a review which is not actually about the product, since the only feedback option is a very character-limited box which applies to the Product Details section, not the entire product description.

Okay, I'm being a bit hyperbolic. There are some differences in the descriptions. For example, under the product description, the one disc version says ""Number of discs: 1"" and the two disc version says ""Number of discs: 2."" So far so good: at least I know that they are not speaking metaphorically when they say ""two-disc version."" Similarly, the title of the one disc edition says ""Batman: Year One (single-disc edition) (2011)"" whereas the title of two disc edition says ""Batman Year One (Two-Disc Special Edition) (2011)"" So it's clear there are two discs, and that the two disc version is special, and that, while both versions need lots of parentheses in the title, the two disc version does not need the colon that's in the title of every other version. Is that because it's special?

Also, the prices are different. The one disc version reads ""List Price: $19.98, Price: $9.49, You Save: $10.49 (53%)"", whereas the two disc version reads ""List Price: $24.98, Price: $19.97, You Save: $5.01 (20%)."" So I know that the one disc version is discounted by 1/2, and costs half as much as the two disc version, which is only discounted by 1/5. Is it worth paying twice as much for the special edition? Is the discount so much less because of how special it is? I don't know, because the only other differences besides obvious things like product numbers and rankings are weird minor inconsistencies under the Product Details section (the two disc version tells you who the Producers, Directors, and Actors are, but the one disc version tells you the run time is 64 minutes--maybe they don't know the run time on the special edition for the same reason they don't know what's special about it).

Under ""Special Features"" they both say ""none."" Really? There are no special features on the special edition? That's weird, because, under the Editorial reviews section, which is the same on both products, it says ""Extras on the Blu-ray/DVD/digital copy set are typically plentiful."" Except neither of these are blu-ray. Unless that's what they mean by ""two disc"" edition--that it has the blu-ray and the DVD. Of course, since the blue ray is currently selling for $7.99, you could buy that and the single disc version for less than the two disc version. Would I be missing out on special features? Dunno. I guess not, since there are ""none"" special features. Kind of like ""none more black"" in Spinal Tap, but not funny, and not stupid on purpose.

Now, to be fair, the two disc version comes with a free rental of the Amazon streaming version, which is worth four bucks. But if the Amazon.com editorial review's reference to the ""blu-ray/DVD/digital copy"" does indeed mean that the two disc special edition is a blu-ray/DVD combo, then it apparently comes with it's own digital copy (as many blu-ray/DVD deluxe editions do), making that rental--which expires after you watch it or after 30 days even if you haven't watched it-- superfluous. You could buy the one disc version of the DVD or the blu-ray and rent the streaming version for less than the price of the special edition, if you really couldn't wait for the physical product to ship. And it's possible you'd either get the special features anyway, or not have access to them if you can't use the blu-ray even if you did buy the special edition.

But maybe that second disc isn't a blu-ray. Maybe it's another DVD with a bunch of extra stuff on it, which would make it well worth the extra money to me. Of course, if it IS a blu-ray, that means that all the special features are probably on the blu-ray disc, not on the DVD, which would make them useless to me, since I don't have a blu-ray player.

One can only speculate. And there are other things I'd rather spend my time speculating, such as, couldn't Amazon just get an intern who understands the concepts of consistency and clarity to edit this stuff? And wouldn't I be screwed if I bought the wrong version and didn't figure any of this out until I bought a disc and tried to use it, since you can't return a DVD or blu-ray if it's been opened?

Now, I could read the product reviews of the two products, and see what they say about the special features, right? Um. no. A). The reviews of both products are exactly the same, B). The first review reads ""format: blu-ray"" (see ""don't have a blu-ray player"" above), and C). I already know I want to see this movie, based on reviews and recommendations from elsewhere, so i don't want to wade through a bunch of reviews I don't need to read in what could likely be a vein attempt to mine information that could decipher the difference between two products with a 100% price difference (if I am going to waste that much time, I'd rather spend it writing this snarky review--also, please excuse the triple-mixed metaphor--also, I am sometimes, here and elsewhere, frustrated by reviews of movies that refer to a specific product, rather than the movie, so it would be nice if reviewers could indicate whether they are reviewing the movie, or a specific edition/print of the movie, and they were sorted accordingly).

So, alas, I will save my $9.49, or $19.97 (or $3.99, or $14.99, digital) and wait until this shows up on streaming here or elsewhere, and when I watch it and/or when Amazon fixes the product descriptions, i will return here and edit this review, because I'm pretty sure this is not a one-star movie.

It is a beautiful looking movie, and it gives Frank Miller's story a good life on the home screen.
The extras are good and plentiful, with a couple of good discussions, including the Conversations with DC Comics, which feature the legendary Denny O'Neil.
The 2 Bonus Cartoons presented by Bruce Timm are truly a bonus: ""Catwalk,"" written by Paul Dini, tells the story of Selena Kyle, aka Catwoman.  ""Cult of The Cat"" again features Selena, who continues to think she can seduce Batman. Of course, she always whacks him after she kisses him. And yet he continues to try to save her. Neither of these episodes is presented in hi-def, and neither looks as good as the main movie, but both are easily worth a second viewing.

Comics are a completely different beast from movies.  Just because your film has the same images (though less stylized in the animation) and dialogue (which gets really bad in the first half with all the inner monologues), doesn't mean it's going to have the same feel as the still images did.  If you want great Batman animated films, try Gotham Knight or Under the Red Hood.  Those make excellent use of the medium.

4604681,5,B0058YPN0U,"After watching and enjoying the recently released ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" from DC Animated, I had to pick us this movie as well. I enjoyed this movie even more than the previous one, and definitely think that any Batman fan (casual or comic enthusiast) should give this movie a spin.

Just like ""The Dark Knight Returns"", Batman Year One is based upon a graphic novel of the same name. Coincidentally this story was also written by Frank Miller, but drawn by someone else, and was created and released after The Dark Knight returns. Batman Year One is also viewed as one of the seminal Batman stories, which influenced comics to come, and even influenced Chris Nolan's ""Batman Begins."" Unfortunately, I have never read this book, with the exception of previews on Amazon. I really liked the art, and plan on buying it in the near future.

I like to call this story the ""Original Batman Begins."" This story focuses on Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham City, after 12 years of travelling the world. Unlike the Nolan film, this movie does not really allude to what Bruce has been doing in his absence, but he has come back with a purpose: to clean the streets of Gotham City. I really like this story because you get to see Batman struggling through his birthing pains, and finding his new identity as Batman. Initially, he is not the smooth polished and precise Batman; we have all come to know.

This story also heavily focuses on the ""New Cop in Town"", LT James Gordon. Gordon comes to Gotham, and seeing the corruption, tries to make a difference. Inevitably, Gordon and Batman form an alliance that will define their relationship for many years to come.

I do not want to give away too much, but in this story we do not see batman going up against the ""Rogues Gallery."" Instead, his enemy is the general corruption in Gotham, whether it be corrupt cops, crime bosses, or street criminals. In some ways this story has a more realistic feel than a lot of Batman stories, you don't have multitudes of costumed criminals or vigilantes causing mayhem, which really emphasizes the oddness of Batman.

The animation style is keeping in line with the ""America-anime'"" influence seen in most DC Animated features. The animation is very different from the original artwork of the comics. I would have preferred a closer appearance to the original, but because of the impressionistic tone of the original, I assume that DC Animated did not find it marketable, and I cannot blame them. I will say though, that even if the animation seems different, the content was dead on, and I say frame by frame. Like I said, I have only seen parts of the graphic novel, but the parts that I did see, where depicted line by line, which is pretty awesome.

I bought the two disc DVD version, and I must say it was worth it. Included with this set you get an extra Catwoman short movie (20 minutes or so), 2 Batman the Animated Series Cartoons (focused on Catwoman but still awesome, and a great Comic History of Batman documentary. The Catwoman movie was ok. I loved the Batman the Animated Series episodes, but I love them all. My favorite feature was the documentary. This documentary, which includes various comic book artists and writers, chronicles the publishing history of Batman, from dark beginnings (Bob Kane) to it's bizarre and Campy era (1950s-1960s and Adam West TV Show), to its return to darkness ( 1970s, Frank Miller, etc). This documentary was very imformative, but still very entertaining.

For a Batman comics fan, this movie is definitely a must buy. For the casual Batman fan (like myself) I think this movie is a good springboard into a whole new world. After watching this movie I want to pick up a lot more Batman graphic novels, and catch up on what I have been missing out on all these years.",1349913600,,3803,4.684131736526946

In this cartoon, the cop sends the monk flying across the train station, landing 20 or 30 feet away. The same cop nudges a car with his bumper while driving and the other car flies through the air and crashes in a fiery explosion (this didn't happen in the comic). Repeat for 60 minutes.

The voice acting is great except for Batman. The animation has brilliant moments but in general feels like a typical american animated TV show with a few extra lighting effects. The brilliant and minimalistic, grimy, textured, tone-heavy and emotion-packed visual style of the comic has been replaced with a bright, gradient-filled, primary color-based look suited for a totally different story.

Also strange, there's basically no scoring (music). The editing is also weak, leaving several moments of awkward silence and non-meaningful pauses.

The script and storyboards are very close to the comic, and the strength of Frank Miller's story still shines through, though a little too brightly and cheaply.",1348272000,,1337,5.147465437788019

4604699,4,B0058YPN0U,"Let's start from the beginning. Batman: Year One was a comic series back in '80 something or other (Sorry I don't know the exact dates). It was recently voted #3 in the 'Top Ten Batman Graphic Novels You Should Read Before You Die.' It short, it is amazing. It takes a darker look into the origin of Batman, and the coruption in the GCPD (Gotham City Police Departmen) that first year or so.

 Now, DCU (Detective Comics Universe) has been making 'movies' (If an hour long cartoon is a movie than OK!) of old, and very sucsessfull comic book series. They've also made 'Under then Red Hood,' which is just as amazing as this movie and the comics, if not better. If you haven't seen it, see it. Period. Anyway, When I first saw the trailers, I was worried it wouldn't follow the book very much. But, man! Was I wrong! It followed it almost perfectly. ALMOST perfectly. Now you can't rent it and notice the mistakes and say, ""Hey, you said it was perfect!"" Yeah.

 Story wise, the exact same as the comic books. It's all about both Lt. Gordon and Batman's first year in commission in Gotham City. Also, although it kinda contiributes, kinda just fills, they talk about yet ANOTHER origin of Catwoman. So, we have the Burton origin, the Year One origin, and the Nolan origin (I hope Nolan makes his own because Tim Burton's was just too supernatural for me. It was creative, but I just have problems with it; And the Year One way is very...adult. Yeah...).

 For a cartoon, it is very well animated. Nearly every shot was similar if not the same for the book. Some of you might say, ""They're just lazy if they did that!"" Well, if you see the movie, you won't want it any other way. So, HA! Now, on a level of 1 to 5, the blood in the movie is about a 3.

 Voice acting wise, it is...OK. The actor who does Jim Gordon, Bryan Cranston, is perfect. He does Gordon almost as good as Oldman, and dare I say this, if not better. Sorry Gary! I do, though, have a complaint. Bruce Wayne and Batman sound almost...robotic. The opening monolouge is the worst of it. He just has no feeling in it! I'm sorry, but the only people who should be Batman are Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, or Kevin Conroy! Eliza Dushku (Catwoman) is good. She puts feeling into her lines, like she's acually there. Over all, it's good, but it could definitly be better.

 Over all, it's a good buy. I got my copy from the Batman: Arkham City Game of the Year Edition. Personally, that's the best deal. You get the game, with ALL the DLC's, and Harley Quinn's Revenge, AND Year One HD with Bonus Features. You wanna know how much? On the out side, $50. On Amazon? $40. It's a total steal. But if you don't have a PS3 or a 360, a DVD copy would be fine. I've seen copies with the Catwoman extra feature, which the Arkham City does not have, but it's all up to you! Over all, I'd give Batman: Year One a 4 outa' 5.",1342310400,,2875,4.317254174397031

Gordon becomes conflicted on knowing if Batman is friend or foe and trying to deal with the corrupted police force.

Very good adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking 4-issue comic book turned graphic novel, Bruce Timm and company has done it again. I liked how the crew who are huge fans of the definitive Batman story besides Dark Knight Returns did a nice job of bringing Miller's story to animated life. Co-starring the voices of Alex Rocco and Elisha Duskhu as the voice of Catwoman/Selina Kyle The animation is very good here and i like how it kept true to Miller's dark and gritty story as some of the voice acting was good but the voice actor who played Batman/Bruce Wayne feels flat if you ask me and not as good as Kevin Conroy but i'm sure Peter Weller as Batman/Bruce Wayne for the upcoming Dark Knight Returns animated adaptation will improve.

4604704,3,B0058YPN0U,"I absolutely love the Batman: Year One graphic novel. It's definitely one of the better comics I've ever read, and absolutely one of the best Batman comics. I've read it a few times and I enjoy it more every time. I love that it isn't just a Batman origin story, but also a Jim Gordon story as well. In fact, it's almost more about Gordon than it is about Batman, and that's not a bad thing. One of Gordon's lines in this story tells us something about him that none of the movies (in my opinion) did. He simply says ""It's been years since I've had to take out a Green Beret"" and then he proceeds to do so. Yes, Jim Gordon is one tough dude.

Here's the funny thing; the movie is VERY faithful to the comic, and yet, it's not as good. There's not one bit of dialog in the movie that was not in the comic, and yet not every bit of dialog or action (more on that later) from the comic is in the movie. It's a movie of very few words. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think a little more exposition would have helped the story flow better in video form.

Also, it really feels more like a motion comic than an animated movie. There's just not that much movement and it's all pretty slow, even the action sequences feel slow, like you're watching individual frames of a movie and not a smoothly flowing video. I also felt like the animation style they chose for the film didn't fit the style and artwork of the comic. It was too clean, too... polished maybe. Granted the characters do look very much like the characters in the comic, but the overall feel was just off.

And then there's the voice acting. When the movie first started with the opening frames of the comic comparing the arrival in Gotham of both Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne, one by train and the other by air, when the very first words were spoken I actually cringed and thought to myself ""Oh no, this isn't good at all!"" It was just an absolutely deadpan, lifeless delivery. It wasn't just ""not good"", it was horrible. Eventually I warmed up to the actor who played Gordon, he did a decent job, but the guy that played Batman was bad, really really bad. The female voice actors on the other hand did an admirable job and were able to convey the proper emphasis and emotions necessary  for their characters.

I'll end with a warning for parents. Granted this is a PG-13 movie, appropriately so, but there is a Catwoman feature on the disc that is basically a 15 or 20 minute mini-movie. A few minutes in there is a scene in a strip club, and while there isn't any nudity of course, suffice it to say it would have been enough to get the 13 year old me plenty excited. And if the ""camera"" as it were had panned just a few degrees in any direction it would have warranted a significant change in the movie rating. What I think is most interesting about this scene being in an animated movie is what was left out of the main feature. As I mentioned before, not everything from the comic ended up on the screen. The one scene that I noticed had been altered from the comic is where Skeevers is in his apartment doing lines of cocaine. They left that out but a provocative scene in a strip club that goes on just a little too long is ok? Interesting.",1336953600,,3214,4.270935960591133
4604705,5,B0058YPN0U,"Batman: Year One is one of my favorite graphic novels, now if only they also did Dark Knight Returns! The animation in this is outstanding, but as good as it is the fight sequences are even better. One of the major problems of animating a graphic novel with such an outstanding story is that sometimes, things just get left out: anyone who has seen Batman/Superman: Public Enemies knows exactly what I am referring to. However, in this particular case they left everything in.

All in all, this has to be one of the better adaptations of a graphic novel. The voice acting is outstanding (Bryan Cranston is flawless as Gordon) and the animation is crisp, while still capturing the decrepitude of Gotham at this point. While this is called Batman: Year One, this really feels like Gordon's story of how he came to Gotham City, rather than how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman.",1336176000,,871,4.6558441558441555
4604706,4,B0058YPN0U,"What's it about?

A 2D animated spin on the origins of Batman and Gordon (before he became Commissioner Gordon), and how their lives come to intertwine.

Is it any good?

Do we really need another Batman origin tale? I think just about everyone knows the origins of Batman (murdered parents, wealthy entrepreneur etc.), but what makes this movie really appealing and unique is that it follows Gordon's origin. The story is based on Frank Miller's hugely popular graphic novel of the same name, and it really does an amazing job of developing the complexity of Gordon's character. It mustn't be easy for a man to move his life to Gotham City, survive police brutality, become a first time dad, the temptation of having a hot young blonde as a colleague, and chasing down a masked vigilante, all in the space of a paltry 60 minute run time. The voice acting is admirable and the dark toned animation really lends itself to the story, making this film worth watching.

Best bit?

Gordon races to save his family, with a little help from the caped crusader.

Did you know?

Batman: Year One was almost adapted as a live-action film to be directed by Darren Aronofsky from a screenplay by Frank Miller. Warner Bros. canned the project in favor of Christopher Nolan.",1335484800,,1260,4.726027397260274
4604707,5,B0058YPN0U,"Let me begin by stating that I have read 'Batman: Year One' by Frank Miller.  Great read.  So I was familier going into this movie what I SHOULD be seeing.  I will further state that I had heard about the voice choice for Batman being all wrong.

Well...mistaks aside this film was quite an enjoyable view.  One thing that people need to know about both the graphic novel and film adaptation, IT'S NOT ABOUT BATMAN!!!

***Minor Spoilers Ahead, Nothing That Will Ruin The Story/Movie For You.***

Batman is sort of a secondary character in the story.  Jim Gordan is front and center mostly.  He is quite interesting character.  The story really delves deep into his thoughts AND who he is.  We pick up Gordan as a younger lieutenant, NOT commisioner yet.  He has just moved to Gotham, after some event in another city, presumably Chicago, not going well for him.  His wife has just became pregant, and Jim is worried about bringing a new life in existance in this dark city.

Right from the get go, things look bad.  Jim's partner, Flass, is obviously a dirty cop in the vein of Denzel Washington from 'Training Day'.  As Flass puts it to Jim, ""This is a great city to be a cop in...""  Not great for it's citizens though.

Bruce Wayne himself is finally coming back to Gotham after traveling abroad for the past 12 years.  He is 25 years old and has be out in the world since he was 13.  He lost his parents at age 7.  This time abroad was his phase of gathering skills and fighting styles.  It's obvious it worked, as he breaks a pile of bricks and shatters a full grown tree while at home, like Jean-Claude Van Dam from 'Kick Boxer'.

The animation quality is top notch.  Shadows are used a lot, and I personally thought they used the ""Film Noir"" style a lot, but in a good way.  As the special features say, ""...Gotham City is a character in itself...""

The portrayel of Jim Gordan is a realistic one.  He is not perfect.  He is not the best husband, due to the demanding hours of being a cop.  He is not too thrilled about his wife's coming child, even stating in the beginning ""...he wished the results would come back negative...""  He gives the job his best, and refuses to become dirty.  Not an easy thing to do when everybody else is.  Think of him once again as Ethan Hawke from 'Training Day', minus the ignorance.  Jim knows the force is dirty from day one, and is gathering evidence to bring it all down.

Enter Batman, a man not governed by rules or family threats.  Batman although his screen time is brief, really goes through a metamorphisis.  You'll realize when watching this that 'Batman Begins' used it as MAJOR source material, downright copying it at times.

---Flaws---

There were a few.  The biggest is the voice choice for Batman.  Benjamin McKenzie was the wrong choice.  Granted Kevin Conroy's voice is too deep now for a young Bruce, they still could have plummed the voice actor's well and found someone.

FYI, Steve Blum had a minor voice role in this.  Why not make him Batman?  Anyway this is a gripe, and one that will not take any stars away from my review.  The film is outstanding besides this.  Gordan's voice is PERFECT.

There are other flaws, but they are in the graphic novel as well.  Jim's baby falling and not dying, Catwoman having short hair.  Batman showing his private parts to Barbara Gordan...(in the film, acting like he was drunk), things like that.  Nothing worth a star being lost.  FYI, his drunk faking did not fool Jim Gordan.

I myself bought the two-disc edition.  I could not find the one-disc edition at Wal-Mart, so I broke down and got the two-disc.  Actually the featurette on disc 2 is not terrible, nothing stellar though.  They must say 20 times that Frank Miller revitalized 'Batman'  I am not sure if the 'Catwoman' short comes on the single disc edition, but I did know it came on the two-disc I was holding.  So I caved.

---Catwoman Short---

A really good short with a good choice on voices.  Eliza Dushku in my humble opinion was a GREAT decision.  She has just the right amount of sultry in her voice, combined with the right amount of harshness.  It's sad to see she was a prostitute originally.  Makes since for her character though, Catwoman sort of strikes me as a woman who has suffered some BAD things in the past, and as a result is damaged goods so to speak.

This short has Selina now more polished than in the 'Batman: Year One' movie.  Her suit is no longer just a Halloween costume, but a useful get up, complete with goggles, her signature whip and claws, and thank god no tail.

The short starts with some thugs trying to kill a cat.  Odd really, they are really adamant about killing this cat.  Actually I never did figure out why they were doing that.  Anyway, Selina is out and on a mission.  This mission takes her to a strip joint, (where she does a very convincing performance herself...), and brings her into contact with the main villian, Rough-Cut.

Won't give anymore away.  Although she is still a burgler, you find yourself rooting for her and whatever her mission is, which soon becomes clear.

This was a good decision to include this with 'Batman'.

---In Conclusion---

Great film.  Followed the source material faithfully.  Really lets you see how Batman and Gordan's relationship started.  Also, one last spoiler, it reveals how Jim all his years working with Batman was not ignorant to the fact he was Bruce Wayne.  After all he is a detective, and a smart one at that.  He just choose not to ever say anything about it.

A must own for any DC animated features collector, and one of the better ones out there.  Only gripe, and last one at that, CAN WE PLEASE NOW HAVE SOME MOVIES ABOUT CHARACTERS OTHER THAN BATMAN OR SUPERMAN???  HOW ABOUT SOME LESS MAINSTREAM ONES LIKE 'DEADMAN' OR PERHAPS DELVE INTO 'ETRIGAN: THE DEMON'.  Just a thought DC Comics.

Well, hope this review helps.  If the single-disc edtion does come with the 'Catwoman' short, get that, as I said the featurette on disc-two is nothing stellar...  Until next time, happy movie watching.  See you at 'The Avengers'.  Sorry for any misspellings/grammer mistakes...",1335484800,,6141,4.563419117647059
4604728,4,B0058YPN0U,"Quick short review:

As a huge fan of the original comic this was a treat of a movie.  This is a perfect transition from comic to movie.

I don't think the voice choice of Batman/Bruce Wayne was the best.  I like Benjamin McKenzie in his other works, I just don't think his voice fit at all and really took away from the experience.  Maybe he'd make a better voice for Green Arrow or The Flash.  There's nothing wrong with his acting, it just doesn't seem right as Batman.

The extras on the dvd are really good.

4604729,3,B0058YPN0U,"I love the Year One comic.  It's my favorite Batman story.  If someone were to ask me the best part about it, I would say, ""The internal monologue.""  That's the storytelling device Frank Miller chose, and it's the spine, skull, and bones of the creature that is Year One.  That's what made the comic so great: Whether it was fear, determination, or courage, the thoughts inside Batman and Gordon's noggin were very engaging.

So, I was a little surprised when I found that it seems the Year One movie-makers didn't seem to ""get"" this.  There are two problems with how this plays out:

1. Bruce's voice sounds bored the whole time.  All of his reflections, all of his convictions, sound, well... sleepy.  When he punches and kicks a hard tree stump while deciding whether or not he can be the Batman, and he says, ""I'm not ready... not yet,"" the comic had him gritting his teeth like he's a furnace of pent-up rage.  But in the movie, he sounds passive, bored, and like he's about to yawn.  This is a voice-acting role for someone to BRING IT.  Year One's Batman voice needed to be someone who could growl out his fierce lines through clenched teeth.  Brian Cranston brings a good gravelly tone to Gordon, but Batman sounds like the guy who makes your sandwich at Subway.  He's just... there.  In the comic, he keeps a cool exterior, but his internal monologue is so, so... motivated.  Committed.  Angry.  Brave.  He stares at people without flinching but in his mind and heart, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on.  Here, they kill it.  It's like Batman's having trouble paying attention to the whole ""Batman"" thing and is thinking about whether to get tacos or pizza on the way home from crime figthing.

2. There is not enough internal monologue.  Again, this is the major story-telling tool, so it is surprising to find that they SKIP a lot of it.  I get that the characters are sometimes doing boring stuff in the comic (like walking down a rainy street) but the reader never got bored because you could read as fast as you wanted:  You didn't finish a word balloon and then sit there staring at the same frame before going forward.  There are a lot of scenes in the movie where boring things are happening and INTERNAL MONOLOGUE WAS WRITTEN IN THE COMIC but the movie inexplicably skips it and has someone silently walking along.

These problems combine to make a great story ultimately boring.  I bought this and regret it.  It's a rental... sorry bat-fans.",1335312000,6,2472,4.605504587155964
4604730,5,B0058YPN0U,"I have watched most of the Batman series animation and this one continues the trend with a well thought out look and feel of it's own. Yes, it is based on the comic book series (Batman: Year One) but it does a good job of pulling it off. It stands on it's own. Even the Catwoman character gets her fair share of air time. After watching this one, I wanted more. Let's hope they continue this Year One theme and make a few more (even if they are not comic book based).",1334966400,,467,4.086956521739131
4604731,5,B0058YPN0U,"One of the best things about Batman is that he has no super powers, so he has to use actual moves and skills when in a fight. Basically what that means is that if he wants to get to the top of a roof, he's going to be animated using grappling hooks, jumping, climbing, etc. Rather than just simply flying, he has to be animated doing gymnastics all the way up there. Batman's lack of super powers makes for more interesting movement, for the most part, MORE movement. You can imagine Batman needing a bigger budget than Superman in an animated movie in order to have some truly realistic fight scenes.
This movie has that. The look is stunning, fights are intriguing and even suspenseful! As always, professional voice acting, matching with the character's look and communicating the tone and mood of the character. Story line was direct and progressed at a good flow.
I especially like their respect for the real world, which thanks to the pg-13 rating, they could make Gotham a truly dark city in an adult's world.

Much respect there for the material. The voice acting was ok. I'm not the one to whine about where's Conroy. He, like Christopher Reeve, don't own the character though they did great jobs. This movie could've been longer but that's fine. I also loved the tough Gordon character. DC has been on a role with these. Keep 'em coming.

Batman's voice is not the voice of Rino Ramano, or Bruce Greenwood. And I'm sorry, again, no. I would love to have Ben McKenzie around to do voices for other characters... but not for Batman.

Bruce Timm knows this and Rocksteady Studios know not to cast anyone else. I'm talking to you, Andrea Romano--you simply must know better than this. EVERYONE knows this. Batman can only be Bruce Wayne and so long as he is able to speak, Bruce Wayne is Kevin f'n Conway. Stop messing with perfection. Wait for his availability and pay whatever it takes.

That you've managed to make a five star animated film despite this is quite a compliment... but all the more saddening. It really is a great movie. I just wish Batman sounded like Batman.",1331683200,3,1278,4.612334801762114
4604737,3,B0058YPN0U,"First of all, there are a couple things in this movie that just don't belong. These are just stupid. It's interesting that both are of a sexual nature.

1. Jim Gordon has an affair---Why is this in the movie? Of course Gordon isn't perfect, but he doesn't compromise on the things that are important. That's Gordon's role in the overall Batman/Gotham story. Gotham is so corrupt that even the police department is controlled by the baddies, yet one man--Jim Gordon---refuses to compromise. Yet here he is in an animated feature cheating on his wife. Just. Doesn't. Belong.
2. Catwoman is a hooker---Selena Kyle/Catwoman is a hooker in the movie. Yet, she's a hooker that's good enough to fight toe to toe with Batman/Bruce. Just. Doesn't. Belong.

These flaws aside, the movie is okay. It's not nearly as good as the better Batman animated features (Under the Red Hood; Mask of the Phantasm; etc.) In fact, it's not even in close to their league. But, it's got some good action, the animation is good, it definitely has a gritty feel, and has some fun moments. I'll give it 3/5, but really for me it's more like 2.5/5.

The dialogue is mostly word for word the same (I specifically remember that ""He put Schell on probation"" line) and a lot of the shots are the same. I'm not a big fan of the blocky animation (reminds me of old anime), but I could get past it.

What I can't get past is that Batman's voice actor is terrible and Gordon's voice actor is almost terrible.  Also a lot of moments feel too rushed and robbed of all their awesomeness.  I'm feeling inarticulate here.  For example, there's a moment when the crowd cheers for Batman and Gordon observes ""they've made a hero out of him."" And then his next line was supposed to be ""But then the cheering disintegrates... and the screaming starts again.""  It should have been an awesome moment because a huge swarm of bats swoops in and reminds everyone that Batman is not your buddy-type hero.  But instead Gordon doesn't say the second part and it all gets glossed over.  Other moments get unnaturally slowed down by voice over.  I guess they had to pick and choose to cut it down to an hour.  The whole presentation could have been much better with an extra half hour to add more weight to some scenes.  Why did it have to be so short?

This was going to be a 2-star review but the final few scenes are well done enough to earn back a star.  Still feels a bit rushed though.  It could have used some more dramatic music too.",1330646400,6,1428,4.319548872180451

4604750,2,B0058YPN0U,"This film is an adaption of the comic written by Frank Miller and drawn by David Mazzuchelli. The adaption of the story to the visual medium was done quite well. The majority of the plot was transferred intact and the story structure of the film seemed rushed in parts, but overall, the story structure remained functional.

Other aspects of the adaption of the story did not make as graceful an adaptation. The animation which is heavily inspired by Japanese Anime, appears ghostly and character often appear to have little in the way of definition. The animators also were overly fond of including shadows, which are everywhere and are often inconsistent. Often there are long shadows of the background of the piece but the characters in the mid0-ground seem to have no shadow at all. Backgrounds in this film are also a serious disappointment, as they are often drab and lifeless landscapes with little to no activity. The action scenes seriously suffer from this as it makes it difficult to feel motivated as the characters careen through drab grey backgrounds. The editor of this film was either not paying attention or encountered monetary constraints with the animation studio, as Batman year one has a distinctly unfinished feel.

The voice acting in Batman Year One is the films biggest failing. Aside from the voice acting of Commissioner Gordon (Bryan Cranston)and a respectable if unexceptional performance of Catwoman (Eliza Duskhu) the voice acting is atrocious. Ben McKenzie's portrayal of Batman is painful to the ears, a dull atonal monotone which would be more appropriate in a high school production of Hamlet. The performances of the rest of the characters, including the portrayal of Carmine Falcone by Alex Rocco, are imminently forgettable.

The performance of Steve Blum as the news anchor and a number of supporting characters was also lackluster. This was mostly due to the fact that Mr. Blum has 3 voices: Steve Blum, Spike Spegiel, and Wolverine. Should anyone in the industry be reading this, please desist hiring Steve Blum to provide half of your vocal cast. His voice is too distinctive and your target audience has seen a large amount of his previous work and can easily discern his voice, usually to the detriment of the movie experience.

The Blu-Ray extras, however, are a mark in the films favor. The short ""Catwoman"" is especially enjoyable despite the fact that it shares the same ghosty animation as the title feature. The three mini-documentaries are interesting and well done and the audio tracks are a must-listen for comic fans.

I would only suggest this film to those who are already fans of comics in general, though If you happen to dislike Japanese animation or the work of Frank Miller (Pre-Dementia) I suggest you give this film a pass.",1328918400,5,2787,4.98494623655914
4604751,1,B0058YPN0U,"I could not even finish the film or it's Catwoman additional feature. I've read the original graphic novel, and for those saying it's true to the source may be reading a different book. The original comic was one of the few Frank Miller stories I enjoyed and now I may have a hard time reading it without thinking of this mess (okay, I'm exaggerating). What went wrong? Well, for one, the voice acting. It is so bad, so grating, that I wanted to turn it off within the first few minutes. I tried to stick with it. But not a single voice was well done. Jim was alright at best, but Bruce Wayne was unbearable. And we aren't talking fun-bad, purposely cheesy, noir voice acting either. That could have worked. The original material was a detective noir with politics and character development. This is just action and bad voice over, without any subtleties. The animation is standard crap you see these days, nothing special. Again, the graphic novel was much better, but the animation wasn't terrible, just incredibly average. I should clarify: if this was simply different, but better or as good than the graphic novel, it would be fine. I don't mind changes, I'm not a defensive fanboy. The problem is this is just plain bad, standalone, even without the comparison. But with the comparison, it is very easy for me to point you to a better version of the same story, the graphic novel.

The animation is super clean, seems likely computer generated, but made to look more like comic book art.  I liked it, but I am sure some purists will object (I don't pretend to understand comic book fanatics, but I have seen how seriously they take this stuff.)

If I would change one thing, it would be to have fleshed out a few things a bit more.  Like Dent's story, he's hardly covered, yet we find out that he and Batman know each other.

I highly recommend it to casual fans of Batman who don't mind dealing with the many variations in story line the series has.  Just enjoy it for what it is...a nice bit of story telling.  I can't say what serious fans think of such things, as they can likely quote chapter and verse from their knowledge of the series.",1327881600,2,954,4.320224719101123

4604756,5,B0058YPN0U,"I just watched the animated movie version of Batman: Year One, a seminal comic book in the history of Batman that chronicled his first year as the caped crusader. I collected the original comics when I was a teenager and they blew me away. Even today I go back and thumb through them every so often, so I was very anxious to see how they translated the comics to animated movie.

I think it translated almost too well.

They used the same faded color palette and ink-heavy art style as the original Frank Miller comic, and it looked great on screen, but I was instantly pulled out of the movie when the dialog started and it was almost word for word from the comic.

I don't know why this threw me, maybe it was the shock that I remembered the text, word for word, from my youth, but it only got worse as they continued not only a word for word retelling, but a panel for panel remake as well. I guess this is what a director means by ""honoring the source material"", but it took me a while to shake off my bouts of deja vu and just watch the movie.

However, once I did settle in and watch the movie I was treated to the same great story that engrossed me in my youth. In fact, I even discovered something new about this story. This may be the origin story of Batman, but Jim Gordon is the real hero of the tale.

Year One not only shows us Batman's beginning, but also Jim Gordon's first year back in Gotham after years in the Chicago P.D. He's young, strong, courageous, and quickly becomes the one good cop in a city of scoundrels. In many ways Gordon is a more capable and compelling figure than Batman, both as a detective and a hero.

As Batman hides in the shadows and tries to figure out how to terrorize Gotham City's criminal elite, Gordon must stand in the plain light of day and figure out how to do good in a corrupt police force that's every bit as dangerous as the mobsters they're supposed to be fighting. It's Gordon who turns out to be the more complex and flawed character, while Batman is just the avenging hero who leaps from the shadows to, ultimately, save the day.

If you have any interest in Batman or animated movies, I encourage you to give Year One a try because it's as good or better than any Hollywood Batman movie or action anime from Japan. Just be warned that if you've read the comic, you may experience severe bouts of deja vu.",1324944000,,2364,4.275167785234899
4604776,3,B0058YPN0U,"Sigh.  Once again, someone adapts a Frank Miller comic and makes a shot-for-shot motion-remake of the comic instead of a living, breathing film.  Even more so than 300 or Sin City, this particular ""remake"" (I won't even call it an ""adaptation"" because it's so slavish) loses what made the original excellent in its desire to replicate the original.

This comic/story is twenty-five years old.  Spoilers follow.

ART/ANIMATION:  I forgive the occasional jerky animation issue.  These aren't high-budget Disney cartoons.  I also forgive the movie's inability to capture Mazzucchelli's gritty, noir-ish style.  That the movie tries and largely succeeds in looking obviously inspired by the original story is enough for me.

SOUND/MUSIC:  I found the sound-effects adequate but not breath-taking, and the music is non-descript action junk.  Don't expect the expression or style of Elfman here.

VOICE ACTING:  What a disappointment.  Many of the voices felt miscast to me (Cranston excepted), but what's worse is that the voice-acting sounds rushed and expressionless to me.  When Bruce is bleeding to death and having the big existential crisis he's avoided for the previous eighteen years and is contemplating suicide-through-inaction, he is no more emotional than he is when first arriving in the city on the plane.  Dushku-as-Catwoman is given little to do, but still she falls flat to me.  The absolute biggest voice disappointment to me, though, is Bryan Cranston's nigh-expressionless Jim Gordon.  Gordon is the emotional center of Year One, and when the story's center lacks emotion, the story lacks it, too.  Personally, I'd love to see Cranston as Gordon in a post-Nolan movie, but only if he brings his Breaking Bad-game to the film, and not whatever he brought here.

SCRIPT/STORY:  Comics and Film are two different mediums.  What works in one might not work in the other.  Words-only Literature and Film are also two different mediums; this is why most adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol,"" for example, feature some memorable lines from the book, but not every one, and certainly not every one verbatim.  Warner Premiere would do well to learn this lesson now.  I've read and reread Miller/Mazzucchelli's Year One perhaps thirty times; I was able to recite 70% of the lines here in my first viewing without effort.  Now, I understand that the readings of the lines here will certainly differ from the ones I've had in my head for twenty-five years.  The problem is that these readings offer no insight into the material; they all fall flat.  Sometimes they seem rushed, but most of the time it just sounds to me like Miller's stylishly-truncated comic dialogue--which works on the page, to be sure--doesn't work on film.  The conversation and the voice-overs needed to be rewritten for film, and they weren't.

As far as the story goes, as this is a rehash of the comic, it has all the same strengths and weaknesses of the original, including the anti-climactic bridge scene where Batman saves the day out of costume.  And improbably, Wayne's original transportation solution (ten-speed) is replaced with something I found completely unbelievable, even in the world of Batman.

MRS. BARBARA GORDON:  However, perhaps the most surprising and distressing flub of this film is the use of Gordon's wife, Barbara.  The film presents her as much more vibrant and happy throughout the first 2/3 of the film, and acknowledges little or none of the marital tension present in the comic.  In fact, the cartoon seems to pay lip-service to the tension, but Mrs. Gordon is given too many lines where she is smiling or hopeful, so that one wonders why Gordon might find himself so smitten with Detective Essen.  Instead of Essen being a single bright light in Gordon's otherwise dreary Gotham existence, so that the reader/viewer can sympathize-with-if-not-approve-of his poor decisions, here we are given a man with a reasonably happy family on the way.  Instead, because of Barbara's too-cheerful development and Essen's lack of development, Gordon's affair with Essen seems capricious and editorially-mandated instead of natural and understandable.

(Note:  In the comics, the development of the budding relationship revolves around cigarettes, and I don't remember seeing many of those in this particular film.  There wasn't a lot of it in the comic, as the whole comic substitutes short panels or sequences for longer scenes.  Again, it works in the comic.  In the film, though, without the cigarettes, without clearer development, the relationship simply fails.)

In the end, I find the whole video simply disappointing.  It's not a travesty or anything, it's just decidedly ""blah,"" and that's a big let-down after the impact Year One had on Batman the character.",1324771200,3,4764,5.178010471204188

There were many little things in the movie that I found to be nice touches, things like the slight movement of Lt. Gordon's head would cause the light to reflect off his glasses. You don't really get that in cartoons nowadays. If you read the original comics by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli you will appreciate that the noir atmosphere was perfectly captured. The feel of the original panel art was there as well. I don't want to go to far into anything in case I drop a spoiler accidentally.

SO the review. There was so many things I found terribly wrong with this movie. First they didn't mention where Bruce Wayne has been before he arrived to Gotham in the first scene. More incite was given about Lt. Gordon past then Bruce. They recap the old mom and dad being shot flashback but that's it. Where did he learn to fight? Where was he for so many years? The one he became Batman out of the blues, where did he get his Batman costume, cape,utility belt? He just woke up and POW! he's Batman. OK, then Catwoman. She was a hooker? A Hooker that whores her self out with underage girls?!?!?! Ok?

The overall story, not enough attention was given to Bruce Wayne's process of becoming a competent superhero and too much attention was given to Lt. Gordon.

Based on Frank Miller's legendary comic book mini-series-within-a-series (NOT a graphic novel in its original form, no matter what the title cards say), BATMAN: YEAR ONE is a powerful adaptation of one of the Caped Crusader's pivotal storylines.  Bryan Cranston is superb as a young Jim Gordon, trying desperately to make amends for past misdeeds in the Gothic urban wasteland of Gotham City.  Here's hoping that Cranston gets the job as the ""real"" Commissioner Gordon when the Batfilm series is rebooted after THE DARK KNIGHT RISES caps the Nolan run on the franchise.  What keeps this film from earning a full five stars is that it annoys me by cutting out some of the best lines in Miller's original story; while it is strongly implied that Selina Kyle is a hooker-cum-Dominatrix (as in the source material), Standards and Practices has evidently neutered the roughest of the original's storyline (Bruce Wayne's description of being sized up by leather boys in the park fails to make the cut, either).  No doubt these cuts were made with an eye to the film's younger viewers--but there's still enough adult material here to make me wary of showing it to any kids under 13 or so.  Indeed, my girlfriend, who is not a comic book movie fan and has not seen any of the other DC Animated movies in their entirety, expressed surprise and mild disapproval at the violence and implied sexuality that is already present and would surely not allow her 10-year-old daughter to watch it.  What we have, then, is an Animated movie that walks the fine line between adult and family entertainment rather uneasily.  Also, Eliza Dushku is a pretty weak choice for Selina/Catwoman in the vocal department--I would much rather have had Adrienne Barbeau or Gina Gershon return to vocal duties (Ben McKenzie is good but not great as Batman/Bruce Wayne, but I am annoyed every time one of these things comes out and Kevin Conroy isn't doing the Bat voices).

I don't think there's any real need for a movie that follows the comic in every exact detail, but if you prefer to watch a book opposed to reading it you'll enjoy this movie.",1322179200,2,519,4.6521739130434785

They did a great job adapting the story, but the voice cast just wasn't that strong.

It is too hard to separate Miller's comic from this DVD, so I won't really try.  ""Batman: Year One"" was Miller's big follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>, both of which established a Batman style and mythos that remains influential today more than twenty years later.  This animated adaptation isn't going to be judged on how entertaining it is individually, but rather on ""Did they get it right?""

For the most part, they did.  The story is almost wholly intact, along with the dialog.  Certain characters have been toned down--mainly Sara Essen--but realistically they had to edit some of the story for timeframe and format. Essen's role is the most logical to cut. She had the least impact on the main storyline, and really was only there in the beginning to lead James Gordon astray.

The focus of ""Batman: Year One"" is aimed towards Gordon, almost to the point where Batman/Bruce Wayne becomes a supporting character.  This actually worked well for me.  Gordon is a strong character, easily able to carry the story, and the focus on him brought the whole tale down to Earth.

Art-wise, they didn't really make an effort to retain David Mazzucchelli's style.  This was disappointing, as they had done such a good job animating Frank Quitely's work for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Star-Superman/dp/B004EE2ZY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All-Star Superman</a>. Granted, Mazzucchelli's line-heavy style might have been visually painful to adapt, but I think they could have made a bigger effort.

The big disappointment for ""Batman: Year One"" was the voice cast.  I realize that they had some tough dialog to work with.  Miller's inner terse inner monologues don't translate all that well from the printed page.  But even so, the ""Film Noir"" quality was mostly lost.

Bryan Cranston as James Gordon really made this DVD, voice-wise.  He was the only one who seemed to really get it. Eliza Dushku as Selina Kyle was just sort of a non-entity for me. If I hadn't read the DVD cover I wouldn't have known it was her, and she made no real impact.  Ben McKenzie was waaaayyy too wimpy.  I didn't buy him as Bruce Wayne, and I certainly didn't buy him as Batman.

For a Batman showcase like this they should have had Kevin Conroy. There really is no comparison; Kevin IS the voice of Batmans.  I have seen an interview with Bruce Timm where he said he wished he could have Conroy for every Batman video.  Why can't they?  Is he too expensive?  I hope they didn't blow their Conroy-cash on Eliza Dushku just to get a ""name"" on the cover.

The Catwoman short as an extra feature is good, but nothing ground breaking or amazing.  It was an odd choice that now--with the controversy involving the portrayal of women in comics--to have a scene where Catwoman plays a stripper.  But it is all in good fun as she soon goes back to kicking guys in the face.",1320969600,,3404,5.432380952380952

I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Batman, even if you're not into ""cartoon"" movies.",1320883200,,369,4.5606060606060606
4604878,1,B0058YPN0U,"I'll state this now: I haven't read the Year One comic, and certainly nothing I saw here inspired me to hunt it down other than to see if the original story was anywhere near as horrible as this movie was.

I'm not even sure where to begin. My wife and I watched this, and by the halfway point, we'd given up hope for a good tale, and simply began mocking everything. The most immediate problem is the voice acting, particularly for Bruce Wayne. He's terrible. No emotion. No inflection. It's a slow, monotonous reading of lines that sound like bad poetry written by an angsty teenager. The rest of the cast do all right, with Gordon particularly shining. But Batman...ugh.

So Bruce and Gordon both return to Gotham, and as expected, the police are corrupt. Okay, this isn't exactly shocking. But they aren't just corrupt. One gets out of a car, beats the tar out of a kid, and throws him in a dumpster...for no reason. None at all. Wasn't trash talking. Wasn't acting tough. Nope, the cop pulls over, gets out, beats him and repeatedly kicks him while he's on the ground, then into the dumpster. Reason given for pulling over and administering the beating? None. This happens throughout the whole movie, to such a laughably over the top extent. Dialog with nearly every cop and Gordon might as well be rewritten as this:

""I'm a bad cop, you see, and we're all bad cops, and we need to be certain that we can trust you to be okay with us being bad cops. That's how Gotham works.""

It kills any sense of realism they're striving so desperately for when you watch policemen ram vehicles into vicious wrecks, gun down people committing petty thefts, and even at one point, drop a bomb on an occupied building. And not even one, but TWO. Forget police brutality, oh no, instead try to take seriously a police force dropping multiple bombs on a building from a helicopter. Their actions have no motives other than ""duuur, we're corrupt"". But they aren't corrupt. They're homicidal maniacs. Anyone who likes this movie, I dare you to watch it again, except this time, pretend every single cop is in the pay of the Joker.

I hated this movie. God. It promises Catwoman, but don't expect much there. Selena Kyle is a prostitute. Given how this is Frank Miller we're talking about, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. But she's a prostitute that can fight really well. No this is not explained. She fights Batman once, neither of them in costume. When the fight ends, the police show up and shoot Bruce Wayne. Who is not moving, not resisting, not even acting particularly threatening. No reason whatsoever, other than the cop likes to shoot people. Or maybe the Joker's getting bored. (Don't worry though...Bruce is placed in the back seat of a police car that has no protection or divider between arrested criminals and the police up front. Realism! So yeah, he escapes.)

Catwoman shows up later inspired by Batman to be a criminal. Only she's incompetent, and steals nothing valuable. And she's jealous of his attention. Sigh. Women as a whole don't do well here in this show. Gordon ends up having an affair with the only competent, interesting female cop. Of course, it comes out of nowhere, it's incredibly cheesy when it happens (they're running from the rain, then forced to duck into a doorway to hide, and then kiss without saying a word). Do they ever show the slightest problem with Gordon's relationship with his wife? Hahahahahhha. I'll just assume the comic did a better job than this lousy show.

Let's see, psycho cops, fire bombs dropped on buildings (seriously, Joker!), a jealous prostitute Catwoman, bad emo lines...oh, right. Physics. At one point when Bruce is being all emo, he kicks down a tree in his yard. One kick. And I don't mean kicks it down. He kicks it in half. It looked like something out of a bad anime. This comes early in the movie, and combined with the horrible line reading accompanying it, it gives you a pretty clear sign of the quality to expect. In an other instant, when Bruce is trying to think of a way to inspire terror in Gotham, he receives his sign in the form of a bat crashing through the windows of his home. One bat break through glass, and live? Fine. I'll give it to you. But this one bat bent the wood beams holding the window and twisted them in three separate directions. So when a horde of bats break down wooden boards nailed to a window later, well, I guess they foreshadowed it...right?

Starting to wish I had kept notes now. I will grant it that the animation is smooth, but it still had some laughable instances. My favorite is when Bruce is hiding his face from Gordon's wife by tilting it to the side (bear in mind, the lights are overhead). His forehead is perfectly lit up, but everything below his eyebrows is solid black. That must be one heck of an impressive caveman forehead Bruce has. It made it look like his eyes were bleeding black.

But I'm nitpicking now. This was not a good Batman story. It's not a good *anything* story. Characters were shallow, no one had any realistic motivations, Batman came across more like a bad poet with anger issues than a superhero, and lacked *any* of the intelligence and detective work he's known for. Gordon ends up being the star, owning up to his mistakes, enduring ridicule and corruption, and taking down a Green Beret with a baseball bat while using only his fists.

And if you're wondering if they explain how he got his combat training...I don't think you've been paying attention to this review, have you?",1320710400,20,5521,4.624489795918367

4604880,3,B0058YPN0U,"I am only somewhat familiar with the original comic, so I cannot really judge how faithful an adaptation the film is. Regardless, I don't think it matters. Faithful != good. A perfect adaptation of crap source material makes for a crap film. Thus I am judging Batman: Year One purely as a film in its own right.

I'll start by saying that the title is misleading. Batman / Bruce Wayne is in no way the main character of the film. He is at best an important supporting character in a film about Jim Gordon. For a film ostensibly about Batman's first year on the job, we see precious little of how he actually became ""The Bat."" Our only clues are a few brief scenes of Bruce Wayne returning from abroad (from where? doing what?), deciding on the bat theme for his suit (a bat flies through his window? really?) and picking a fight with a pimp (a messy but interesting scene).

If you're expecting to learn about how Batman designed some his gadgets, or perfected his detective skills, then this isn't your film. If, however, you've always wondered what Jim Gordon has had to go through dealing with corrupt cops and a vigilante crime fighter, then indeed this is your film. You'll learn all about Jim's marriage, style of police work, and relationship with other cops.

There are characters within the Batman universe worthy of their own films and character studies - characters like Catwoman (totally tacked on in this story, though enjoyable in her short film), Robin, Batgirl, or the joker. Jim Gordon is arguably one such character. Nevertheless, this film assumes that we DO care a great deal about Jim Gordon, to such an extent that it makes sense to title a film ""Batman: Year One"" and then spend 60 - 70% of the screen time on Jim Gordon.

For what it is, it's well done. The animation is good and Gordon's story is compelling. Catwoman's short alone is almost worth the price of admission. Nevertheless, because of how poorly the film tells Batman's story, I can't recommend it to everyone. This one is for collectors and hardcore Batman fans only.",1320537600,2,2055,4.652892561983471

I like the adult style of the film but i feel that at some points the film seeks to entertain and relys on us as viewers allowing our imagination to keep pace with the movie, regardless of logic. Not to be overly critical but somethings just make no sense. For example Bruce Wayne kicks through a tree that is clearly a couple of feet in diameter.

Its very faithful to the shots and story but in a way too committed.

Too bad they ignored that formula

The voices don't fit what you thought they would be, its like a table reading of kids with no understanding of Frank Miller they take away pieces inner monologue which is the heart of the comic and what ties the story together, and its not dark enough, too clean.

With far fewer gadgets, far more mistakes and no allies, BYO focuses on Batman as a newbie crime fighter - something that hasn't been done before in movies or animation. While many of us are sick of Hollywood prequel fever (i.e. Spiderman 4), BYO actually got it right by keeping it short and simple. No real cliffhangers, no super-complex plot, no huge leaps of faith (although I do question the last fight scene of the movie - man of foot chasing motorcycle and car...really???), and most importantly no major deviations from the original story line. Throughout the movie there was great attention to detail, I really felt like I was transported into the past to discover a side of Batman I never knew. BYO also has two parallel story lines (Lt. Gordan's 'on the job training' and an intro to Catwoman) that fit in nicely. Personally, I would have like to have seen a 2 or 3 minute flashback on Catwoman's background, but that's just me.

As a life-long Batman fan, I was anxiously awaiting this DVD.  I was very disappointed.  The ""story"" was awful.  This should have been called JIM GORDON - YEAR ONE as the main story was Gordon and how he began at the Gotham City PD.  As for the story line of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman, it is the worst origin story of Batman I have ever seen.  A few seconds of his parents being killed, not showing how it affected him mentally over the years, not even the dialogue of the thief wanting his mothers pearl necklace, just awful.  The origin of Batman was superbly told in BATMAN MASK OF THE PHANTASM.  That is the animated movie I would strongly suggest over this.  BATMAN YEAR ONE was poorly done, story was very weak, and why the Catwoman's origin was thrown in as well is totally beyond me.  It also is  not the correct origin of Catwoman. Also, I was hoping for a realistic adaptation of Batman.  Having Batman kick doors off of cars, kick a tree over, fly through the air, come on.  If the creators of this don't take the story seriously how is anyone else going to.  If I want to see a guy kick a door off of a car or kick a tree over, I'll buy Superman. I am just amazed at how badly every aspect of this movie was done.  Thankfully, it is only about one hour long so it is only an hour wasted.",1319673600,9,1461,4.223826714801444

4604890,3,B0058YPN0U,"Batman Year One is one of the greatest Batman stories ever told. When DC chose Year One as their next direct-to-dvd animated feature, I was so excited. I'm a little disappointed at how the final product turned out. I still like the film, but there are certain aspects of this feature that could have been improved upon or left out completely.

The Animation - was very good and clean, well a little too clean. I wanted the grittiness of the graphic novel, but that really isn't here. The character designs had jagged edges, similar to what we see in all the other DC animated DVD features. The designs didn't really resemble David Mazzucchelli's artwork in the comic. The Story - was pretty faithful to the comic, but it felt very rushed and there was one scene in the movie I didn't like at all. When Bruce fights Selina in the comic, the fight is kept short and the winner is obviously Bruce. And it makes sense, since he's better trained and has more will and motivation than probably any character in the DC universe. In the comic, there's some narration from Bruce while he fights Selina and it goes like this-- ""That's good. She's had karate training...but, only karate"" and then Bruce slugs her. That dialogue alludes to the fact that Selina isn't even in the same league as Bruce when it comes to fighting. However, in the film, Selina and Bruce are exchanging blow after blow as if they were equals. How is it that Selina (a woman who probably doesn't train that hard) almost bests a dude who can kick a tree in half? Call me sexist, it's ok, because I call PC bull$#!+. The Acting - could've been better, but it was still decent. The guy who plays Bruce/Batman sometimes sounds like a robot, though. Not sure if that was intentional.

Overall, it's an entertaining movie, but also disappointing in so many ways.",1319587200,10,1821,4.58282208588957
4604891,5,B0058YPN0U,"""Batman Year One"" is a terrific animated adaptation of the classic four-part story (long since collected into the graphic novel format) that originally appeared in the Batman comic book in the late 80's.  The major players include Lieutenant Jim Gordon (long before his ""Commissioner Gordon"" days), Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman), and many corrupt politicians and police officials.  Believe me, you won't miss the absence of a colorful, larger-than-life villain like the Joker in this urban, grimy, immersive story set in the streets of Gotham.

What's so innovative about ""Year One"", both the comic and the DVD? Though Batman's origin story had been re-told many times prior to the ""Year One"" comic books, an extended look at the trials and tribulations of the Caped Crusader's early days was never before attempted.  With ""Year One"", we now got to see Bruce Wayne's false starts, failures, eventual refinement of techniques, etc., on the road to his becoming the costumed crime fighter revered by Gotham City's citizens and intensely feared by its criminal element.

That engaging premise, and the great storytelling that fulfilled its potential, made for great comics reading, and now, with this animated adaptation, great home viewing.  Just be warned, like the original comic book story, this animated film is dark, gritty, and laced with adult themes and language.  This particular Batman story isn't for the kids.

The two-disc version of ""Batman Year One"" contains a fair amount of material.  On disc one you get the main feature (about 65 minutes long), a few previews of other DC Comics animated projects (films, TV shows, video games, etc.), and an action-oriented, pretty decent (but again, very adult) 15-minute film starring Catwoman.

The second disc contains an engaging documentary (23 minutes long) about the genesis of both the ""Batman Year One"" comic book and, many years later, the animated film, with a major emphasis on the whole movement, beginning in the 1970's, to ""serious up"" Batman after years of goofy comics and the campy Batman TV series starring Adam West.  Disc two also contains a couple of bonus Batman cartoons (about 20 minutes each) from the 90's, which were fun to see.

If you've been enjoying the various direct-to-DVD animated films based on DC's comic book heroes and famous storylines, or are just someone who enjoys gritty heroic adventure stories, I can't imagine not liking ""Batman Year One"".  It's one of the better presentations from a string of DVDs that's pretty solid to begin with.

And if you don't need all the bells and whistles, just get the less expensive single-disc version.  In the end, it's the movie that's the important thing. And this is definitely a movie that's worth your time.",1319587200,,2742,5.089285714285714
4604892,4,B0058YPN0U,"""Batman:  Year One"" is an interesting movie covering Batman's humble beginnings as he gradually learns the ropes to become the Dark Knight we all know today.  However, the gem of this movie is the exploration of the human side of an otherwise rarely fleshed-out character, Lieutenant (later Commissioner) Jim Gordon, and the beginnings of respect and friendship that Batman and Gordon form in the early stages of their respective crime-fighting careers.  Much of the movie focuses on Gordon's return to the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) and all of the stress that entails; Gordon is an honest cop afloat in a sea of corrupted city officials that he must learn to keep his guard up with or face dire consequences for him and his family.  The tale is presented (true to its comic lineage) as a gritty, well thought out origin-story replete with appearances from Harvey Dent (Two Face), Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Vicki Vale and everyone's favorite butler, Alfred.

Being a huge fan of the title graphic novel , I was pleasantly surprised at how faithful the movie adaptation tracked with the original writing.  Sure everything is not 100% the same, like certain scenes being extended (Selina's fight with a disguised Bruce Wayne), some cut short, and some minor dialogue changes - but everything is so close to the graphic novel in its presentation and style - you can tell that the producers truly wanted to honor Frank Miller's vision of Batman's beginnings.

ANIMATION: The animation of the film is very well done.  The depictions of scenes on screen are practically taken out of the graphic novel and made a thing of motion.  The colors have of course been adapted to be more visually appealing on screen, however the selection of color used allowed them to translate scenes to film without loosing the ""feel"" of grittiness.  We watched the movie in Blu-Ray, and the animation picture quality was very crisp.

Though the animation is done very well, this movie lost some points from me due to the attempted ""3-D"" input which seems to plague many animated movies today.  To explain what I am talking about:  when a plane flies, or a car chase scene occurs, the animated pictures assumes more of a 3-D feel to it instead of remaining completely animated.  I'm sure some individuals enjoy this, but I do not.  To me, it takes me out of the movie and looks ""cheap"" even though I'm sure it was just an artistic choice by the producers.

ACTORS:  I thought that the voice actors for this movie did a good job of portraying their characters, with one glaringly important exception:  Ben Mckenzie as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  In my opinion (and those that watched the movie with me) McKenzie was just not right for this roll.  He did not ""sound"" like Batman.  Granted, Batman is younger in this movie, but the edge to his voice, and the fire of someone that had dedicated his life to avenging his parents' murders was just not there.  Additionally, some of the monologue lines presented by McKenzie practically sounded like they were being read instead of acted, it was as if there was no emotion behind them; even if the intent was to present a detached character, it still came across very hollow.  Near the last 3/4 of the movie, McKenzie's presentation of BW/BM became a little better, but still left me wishing that they had cast someone more appropriate for the role.

CONCLUSION:  ""Batman:  Year One"" is a relatively short movie at just over an hour (64 minutes) but none of that hour is wasted - there is either character building, or plot-driven action during the entire movie - though I still wish it were longer.  The production team has gone to great lengths to stay very faithful to the source material, so if you liked the ""Batman:  Year One"" graphic novel, you will probably like this movie if for no other reason than to see the graphic novel brought to life.  Why 3.5 stars?  The voice acting by McKenzie really brought the movie down for me, and left me with a ""meh"" feeling that the other recent Batman movies never did; I think with the proper casting for BW/BM, I really would have loved this movie.  Bottom line - if you are a Batman fan (like me), and think you would enjoy a cartoon-update depicting a ""real world"" grittier version of his crime-fighting beginnings, then you will probably enjoy watching this movie.  My only recommendation would be to rent it before buying it due to the issues I noted.",1319500800,2,4420,4.744764397905759
4604893,4,B0058YPN0U,"This may in fact be a record on my review of the new DCAU film `Batman: Year One'.

There really isn't much to say about it, except for the fact that it does true Batman fans proud. This film is the comic come to life page for page, much like other films such as `Watchemen' & `300'. If you have read the graphic novel you will be impressed by pretty much everything. The colors, the dialogue and the feel of the film as a whole is the graphic novel. However, for first time DCAU film watchers, this may not be the right film to start with. Because there are many people out there that haven't picked up the comic book itself there is a lot of inner dialogue and a lot of cut scenes much like a comic book. It's got a great voice cast however, I wasn't too impressed with Ben Mackenzie as Batman, but Bryan Cranston as Jim Gordon was excellent.  The film itself while like the comic is really short just over an hour, it doesn't have a solid ending. Most people may not appreciate that if they never read the book, but this story is only a small chapter in a much bigger story so pretty much it is what it is.

`Batman: Year One' is one of the greatest Batman Stories ever told and bringing another Frank Miller story to life especially when it pays true tribute to the comic is always admirable. Still, it may not be as enjoyable as some of the films DCAU already has, but it is a good addition to the collection.

FYI, don't forget to pick up the two disc edition if you are purchasing a DVD that way you get the extra features along with the new DC Showcase 'Catwoman'.",1319500800,2,1572,4.195364238410596
4604894,5,B0058YPN0U,"As everyone has said before me - this is a very true, almost panel-for-panel from the main four-issue run of the comics. Amazing animation and character designs. Great music. Almost perfect voice casting. Benjamin McKenzie is brought in to lend the voice of Batman. And he does it well.

But he falters in voicing Bruce Wayne. It's just a bit awkward, over-the-top.

We know the story. Batman comes home to unknowingly create the Batman. At the same time, Jim Gordon is brought into Gotham as a lieutenant for the GPD. We love the story. It's not Batman's origin. It's not Gordon's origin. This is the origin of the most powerful team-up in the whole of Gotham. In a way, this makes the Year One film a pretty important effort.

And we are treated well for this BD release. We have two fun behind-the-scenes (a close look at the darker side of Batman and a conversation between some of DC's big-wigs about how they came to love the Bat), a sneak peak of Justice League: Doom (which we'll see all the fan faves return as voices for the JLA), sneak peaks for the Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, trailers for the GL Animated Series, and the picks of Bruce Timm. The Catwoman (Eliza Dushku is amazing in the role in the short and the main feature) short feature was a great addition, and it is rooted  in the same noire take as the main feature of Year One. I think the fans have come to realize the quality of work for all of these DC animated features, and I think DC has realized this as well.

I'm still waiting for a Flash, Martian Manhunter, or Swamp Thing feature, but we still get another powerful entry in the DC animated universe. Even still, I applaud their every effort, and constantly find myself eagerly awaiting what comes next.",1319500800,,1739,4.525477707006369

4604937,4,B0058YPN0U,"- Bruce Wayne, pre-Batman: ""I'm not ready. I have the means... the skill... But something's missing. I have to wait.""

In 1987 Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli launched the ""Year One"" craze with their BATMAN: YEAR ONE arc, a gripping look back at the earliest days of Gotham City's most driven and pointy-eared vigilante. For my money and most everyone else's, this arc is near as monumental as Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. It's certainly more noirish, more real, told on a more intimate stage. In the wake of BATMAN: YEAR ONE, DC soon churned out BATGIRL: YEAR ONE, JUSTICE LEAGUE: YEAR ONE, TEEN TITANS: YEAR ONE... You get the picture. Even Dynamite Entertainment's jumped on the bandwagon with its SHERLOCK HOLMES: YEAR ONE volume. Point being, BATMAN: YEAR ONE is so influential that it absolutely deserves an animated feature adaptation.

After living abroad for twelve years, 25-year-old Bruce Wayne, Gotham City's richest, most eligible bachelor, has come home to begin his crimefighting career and to kick off his perceived life of hedonism. No need to go into Bruce's childhood past. We know what happened and how it influenced the course of his life. But it's fascinating to eyeball Bruce Wayne as a rank amateur, still finding his legs, still bumbling about. His first sortie out in the crime-infested streets doesn't go well.

Except that I think of this arc as Jim Gordon: Year One even more so than Batman: Year One. It's a pure revelation meeting a young and badass Lieutenant Gordon, newly arrived to Gotham and living down a rep in Chicago as a badge what ratted out his fellow cops. He gazes around his new city and his bleak mood grows bleaker as he soaks in the city's widespread corruption. If ever a town needed cleaning up...

Adding to the misery is that Gotham's Finest are mostly dirty, and Gordon is advised by a crooked Lieutenant that cooperation amongst the boys in blue is key for survival (wink wink, nudge nudge). This advice falls on deaf ears. Jim Gordon is a righteous law enforcer. I don't know that he's a righteous husband to his pregnant wife. Not when his colleague is the attractive Detective Sarah Essen, diligently working on his cases, quiet temptation on long legs and voiced by Katee Sackhoff. What follows makes Jim Gordon a flesh and blood person, adds grays to his character.

BATMAN: YEAR ONE is also about how our two main characters came to form an alliance, the cop and the vigilante, essentially two sides of the same coin. We note how their respective story arcs spiral into their inevitable meeting and their wary regard of each other and the origins of a relationship based on mutual dependency. The vigilante who is assured that there's at least one honest cop in GCPD; the cop who takes comfort in knowing that someone on the outside has got his back. And I'll leave it up to you whether Jim Gordon in the end has actually sussed out the Batman's true identity.

Crooked cops. Rampant racketeering. A soiled dove named Selina Kyle inspired by the Batman's costume and derring-do (and voiced by Eliza Dushku). An effective low keyed noirish tone. Told from the alternating perspectives of Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon. Both men get a chance to throw down. And while we're used to Batman's serving up all sorts of beatdowns, he's clearly not as polished, his moves and methods not yet perfected. It's unexpectedly thrilling to see Lt. Gordon claim vengeance on a crooked detective what had led an ambush on him. In a city of rampant lawlessness Gordon stands as an honorable but baaaaad mother. It's awesome watching him be this confident man of action, to see him dust off some martial arts moves. I love that while he doesn't talk smack, we're privy to what he's thinking. About to go toe to toe against a rival cop, he tosses him a bat and muses to himself: ""It's been years since I had to take out a Green Beret. Even so, he deserves a handicap."" Gordon proceeds to pwn the dirty cop.

BATMAN: YEAR ONE has a running time of 64 minutes which means that it's mostly lean, not much fat (you could argue that Selina Kyle's cameos are unnecessary, even if she was in Miller's source material). It's animated beautifully, but the only time I felt the artists were giving a nod to Mazzucchelli's style was when Wayne was in costume. Batman's visual design looks exactly how Mazzucchelli illustrated him. All in all, a laudable animated stab at one of the best Batman (and Jim Gordon) stories ever told.

The DC Showcase animated short (00:14:45 minutes running time) features Catwoman, again voiced by Eliza Dushku. It follows the pattern of previous DC Showcase shorts in that it is balls to the wall action, and the visuals are gorgeous and kinetic. But this isn't for the kids. There is implied nudity and, in pursuit of a pair of henchmen (they were shooting at a neighborhood cat), Catwoman ends up in a strip bar and takes a turn on the dance pole. Catwoman eventually comes face to face with the henchmen's boss, a vicious giant smuggler named Rough Cut. Theirs is a brutal rumble, with Catwoman receiving as good as she dishes out.

  For one, we didn't need another Batman origins movie, since Batman Begins already did a fine job telling that story. While the animation is a step in the wrong direction for Batman, when the animation in the previous films is far superior.

I like the comic Batman Year One and while the animated movies follows it well I didn't enjoy it at all.  There seems to be much less focus on Batman and Bruce Wayne. The plot works well in a comic format but feels too disjointed to follow it panel for panel in a movie.  I would have like to have seen a more creative interpretation like in Crisis on 2 earths or All Star Superman (which cuts down some stories to put more focus on the Lex storyline).

Production:
The animation itself is great, some of the best from DCAU.  Sadly, the voice acting for Batman is the worst voice acting in and DC animated feature.  Its stiff and awkward the whole way through.

Rent it if you need to see it but its not great.  Offers nothing interesting.  Want to enjoy a batman animation, Under the Red Hood is great, this is forgettable.",1319155200,5,831,4.316129032258065
4604942,4,B0058YPN0U,"Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is a landmark classic not only in Batman mythology, but in all of modern comic book history as a whole.  This latest DC Universe animated film adapts the classic story, which tells the beginnings of Batman as young Bruce Wayne (voiced by Ben McKenzie) returns to Gotham City after a lengthy absence.  Also coming to the city is cop Jim Gordon (voiced by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston), who seems to be the only clean and honest cop in a department, and city, full of criminal scumbags.  As they both take seperate yet intertwining paths, they find themselves on a collision course that marks the beginning of their bond.  What Year One the comic managed to inject in terms of grittiness and humanity into both Batman and Gordon, this animated adaptation manages to relatively do it well for the most part.  The only real drawbacks to it are that McKenzie is definitely lacking in terms of voicing Bruce/Batman, while the script doesn't quite pack the punch of the comic.  Still though, Cranston is wonderful as the voice of Gordon, while Eliza Dushku is pretty good as Catwoman (who also stars in her own DC Showcase short included here, which is actually pretty entertaining), and the animation is simply wonderful and manages to both pay homage and emulate David Mazzucchelli's artwork.  All in all, it isn't perfect, but for what it's worth, this animated take on Batman: Year One is wholeheartedly worth your time.",1319068800,3,1450,4.846153846153846
4604943,5,B0058YPN0U,"Batman: Year One is an adaptation of the celebrated, 1987 graphic novel by Frank Miller, much of which influenced Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. I admit that I'm a casual reader of the graphic novels who wasn't completely blown away reading Miller's story. I must add that reading it in one sitting and only being a casual reader, it's possible that I just wasn't ""ready"" for it. Released under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies banner, a banner that has released a string of acclaimed comic adaptations geared towards adults, this 2011 adaptation is very faithful to Miller's writing and the illustrations and coloring by David Mazzucchelli and Richard Lewis. When one thinks of animated Batman, the popular television series from the `90s, which was kid-friendly but with enough dark material to appeal to more mature audiences, likely comes to mind. This is a completely different beast, with a different animation style and a darker tone. The film is rated PG-13 for ""violence and some sexual material"" which coupled with at least one use of the ""f-word,"" mature themes, and Selina Kyle (a.k.a. Catwoman) as an Africa-American dominatrix, makes this a film that is unapologetically aimed directly at adults. Fortunately, it should satisfy that intended audience.

Bruce Wayne (voiced by Ben McKenzie) returns home from Gotham City after a 12-year absence, while Lt. Jim Gordon (Bryan Cranston) arrives in Gotham with his pregnant wife after being transferred out of Chicago. The two pull double duty narrating the story while Gordon is confronted with the rampant police corruption throughout the city and Bruce begins his transition into becoming Batman. While Harvey Dent and Selina Kyle are present, their villainous alter egos are not. Selina Kyle appears as Catwoman, but she's merely a burglar rather than a villain. With themes including corruption and adultery, the lack of iconic Batman foes, and Gordon serving as the main character, those expecting a straightforward take on Batman may be taken aback. Those familiar with the graphic novel or those with a desire for a darker take on Batman will find this refreshing.

The animation is executed with stunning clarity, more colorful than the original drawings but retaining the gritty look and atmosphere. The style recalls anime, but is much more refined, and is so vivid at times it resembles rotoscoping (used prominently in A Scanner Darkly). The animation complements the already dark and edgy story, while successfully distancing itself from previous animated incarnations. The voice-work is a perfect fit too, with Cranston's performance as Gordon being the most notable. Some viewers may scoff at the idea of (the guy from The O.C.) Ben McKenzie voicing Batman and his vocal performance is a mixed bag. When McKenzie performs as the character it sounds natural, but when he performs narrator duties it sounds too ""performed.""

Batman: Year One is the darkest portrayal I've ever seen of Batman in the realm of animation and possibly the darkest I've ever seen onscreen. The material speaks volumes about the strength of the Batman character, proving that the character alone can carry a tense, compelling story without flamboyant villains. It's one thing for an animated Batman film to be a faithful adaptation that strays from the norm by presenting the character differently and a whole different thing all-together for it to be as entertaining, bold, and human as this. Despite a 61-minute running time, it succeeds in telling a complete story and never feels rushed or haphazardly put together. It's accessible enough to please the fans of the source material without alienating those unfamiliar with it. I enjoyed it so much, that as pleased and satisfied as I was when it ended, I wanted more. I would've liked to see the plot expanded, perhaps incorporating elements of Miller's other Batman writings, but it's probably best not to over-complicate something that stands so strong on its own. Animated Batman films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mask-of-the-Phantasm/dp/B000A9QKLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mask of the Phantasm</a>&nbsp;have been known to gain substantial followings and be held in higher regard than some of the live-action films. I can only speculate, but I think this adaptation will prove to be one of those. For those who like their Batman to be portrayed in a gritty, realistic setting with a psychological tinge this will not disappoint.

4604944,3,B0058YPN0U,"Let me first off by stating that I am a huge Batman fan. My favorite superhero hands down. I was looking forward to this movie after watching Under the Red Hood (which is an awesome Batman animated movie). This movie is about Batman's and Gordon's first year on the job; the story is very similar to Batman Begins. The animation style is nice but nothing to write home about. There were no sequences or fight scenes that stood out more than others. The voice acting was little mono-toned for Batman and Gordon, both of which are the primary focuses of the story.

It was obvious that the creators wanted to go with a more adult and dark take on Batman. The story was a little slow to start and pretty much ended on a less than stellar action sequence. I don't want to give anything away or spoil anything so I won't go into detail about the story. While watching the movie I couldn't help but get the feeling that the creators were touching on some great content but fail to fully explore or realize them. There were some moments where the story was going down an interesting path and then it simply changes lanes and go a different direction. Bummer! Character development was very weak and one dimensional. Let me say this, the moment Bruce realized that he wanted to be Batman was one of the worse scenes in the movie; it almost felt forced. Gordon and Catwoman's drive was never really addressed, it was like they just one day decided to do and be what they are in the Batman universe.

I think if you were going to buy one animated Batman movie, go with Under the Red Hood. This one falls into the rental or bargain bend category for me, not something I would watch more than once.

Batman Year One this was a blind watch for me. Didn't really know what I was getting myself into, but I've enjoyed a lot!.
You're given 2 & half stories to work with Characters: Gordon (Commissioner to be), Bruce/Batman (Batman to be), Selina/Catwoman (catwoman to be? not really) her story didn't really flesh out like the other two did. Regardless..I'm still happy, she at least put on the tights though. (Note that I didn't see the animated short, maybe there more to be seen about catwoman.)
Gordon hands down was the star of the show no matter how you look at it. His realistic portrait of a character shines big time & so does his weakness. Batman? well, he's Batman... There wasn't really anything too different about the character, nor do I feel the need to worry about him taking care of business.
Pros: Great story, lot of action, &(Didn't feel too short either surprisingly)
Cons: Catwoman story felt like it didn't belong , being shot means nothing in this movie, some questionable batman actions? strength for example way too strong.",1319068800,2,1085,4.71578947368421

Also Eliza Dushku doing Catwoman's voice in the film short seemed off as well. I think Bryan Cranston (Lt. Gordon) and Katee Sackhoff (Det. Essen) did a great job though.

4604987,5,B0058YPN0U,"Batman: Year One is the DC comics adaptation of the 1986 graphic novel.  Hot off the success of Dark Knight Returns, Frank Miller and illustrator David Mazzuchelli craft a tale about Bruce Wayne's first year as crime fighter.  There are certain elements that come into play to develop Bruce's career. Jim Gordon becomes the newly appointed commissioner of police. His boss is a  corrupt politician with his strong arm lieutenant; who murders anyone who threatens his livelihood. Salina Kyle turns out to be a street walker who evolves into Cat Woman. There are a lot of adult themes in this adult origin of the caped crusader.

As an animated movie that runs close to sixty four minutes, it cleverly combines the old mythology with the new.  I only wish that creators Miller and Mazzuchelli had input into storyboarding and scripting.  It gives you highlights of the graphic novel but missed many opportunities to tell the entire story.  This might have been better in a mini-series format of animated films.  The next animated movie intends to  do exactly that in Miller's ""Dark Knight Returns"" next year. His very influential graphic novel will be animated in two parts.  It's unfortunate the producers didn't extend this epic story into two movies also.

The extras present a lot of material for the uninitiated, in the world of Batman.  The new Cat Woman short film is on par with the main feature.  She fights a formidable diamond thief that looks more like a football linebacker.  The drama and action hold up against any of the DC animated movies to date.  The additional Cat Woman episodes from Batman: The animated series are a rare treat into the world of Batman's favorite and most deadly nemesis.  We get to see a brief glimpse into the psychological makeup of the character.

The documentary about Frank Miller's influence on the character also bears some new information. I didn't know he was fresh off the Daredevil title before proposing Dark Knight Returns.

4604990,5,B0058YPN0U,"Batman: Year One is the latest animated movie from Warner Premiere. Based upon the Frank Miller classic of the same name, it tells the story of Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne as they first come to Gotham City to clean the streets of evildoers. Hate to admit it but it reminded me alot of the animated Spawn series on HBO with its' grittiness. While this animated direct-to-video feature is a very close adaptation of Miller's novel and I enjoyed it immensely, I did have some qualms about the feature as a whole. First and foremost, by the time you get into the story good, it's over. Given, for something of this nature, that might not be such a bad thing. But, it would've help this feature alot more if we got to know the characters a little better to understand what drove them in the first place to do what they do in the feature. For that alone, it makes the story a little dry in its' narrative. Second, although a minor complaint, is the fact that Warner decided to go with the animation style it did instead of going with something a little closer to artist David Mazzucchelli.

For the most part, everything works in this feature. People will no doubt draw comparisons to the movie, Batman Begins, with this feature(it too was based upon Batman: Year One and Batman:The Long Halloween)...with people praising the movie more. However, I like this alot more as it follows the novel more closely. Frank Miller's story is outstanding.

While this might not be Warner's best to date, it is one that shows Warner is getting better at what they do.

""Batman: Year One"" presents the first year of Batman's career through the eyes of Jim Gordon. Above everything, Year One is Jim Gordon's story as he comes to understand that he and Batman are partners in a war for Gotham. Being set so early in the Dark Knight's career, none of Batman's most famous adversaries appear, instead his most persistent enemy is the corruption in the city's police department.

The voice cast is perfect. Benjamin McKenzie is the best person they've gotten to voice Batman since Kevin Conroy. Eliza Dushku fits this interpretation of Catwoman, a bold thief that also doubles as a stripper or prostitute. But, Bryan Cranston carries the entire film, making Jim Gordon a believable human character. As usual, the animation for these DC movies is top notch. They really nailed the character models based on the original art by David Mazzuccheli. They stuck so close to the look and feel of the source material, that the film is very subdued in both plot and color wise.

If it has one weakness, ""Batman: Year One"" problem is that it was so great that it's been often imitated. Bruce Timm borrowed from Year One. Christopher Nolan borrowed from Year One. As far back as the Tim Burton Batman films, Burton borrowed from Year One. Batman is trapped in a building and has to fight the SWAT team, that also happens in Batman Begins. So, it's a real treat for fans of the original storyline to see it animated. But, to those that haven't read the comics, it's another good Batman story.

Extras on the Blu-ray:

DC Showcase: Catwoman - A much more action centered 15-minute adventure written by fan favorite writer Paul Dini.

Commentary with the production staff: Adrea Romano (Voice Director), Mike Carlin (DC Entertainment), Alan Burnett (Co-Producer), and Sam Liu (Co-Director).

Conversations with DC Comics: A group discussion with Denny O'Neil, Dan Didio, and Scott Snyder as they discuss their favorite moments of Batman Year One and how it has affected Batman as a whole.

Chapter One of Batman: Year One. A digital comic that basically served as a story board for the movie.

Heart of Vengeance: Returning Batman to His Roots. A 20 minute documentary about how Frank Miller reinvented the character with Batman Year One. As well as Denny O'Neil's role in the Batman mythos.

Two episodes from Batman the Animated Series: ""Cat Walk"" and ""Cult of the Cat.""

A ""Sneak Peek"" at ""Justice League: Doom"" It's great to see the cast from Justice League returning.

Then trailers for All-Star Superman, Green Lantern: Emeral Knights, and others pad out the disk.

""Batman: Year One"" is a great Batman story. It's a bit more subdued for my own personal tastes, but it is an integral part of the Batman mythos that all fans of the character should watch at least once. I'm scoring it a bit low, 4 out of 5, despite the fact that it is a near perfect adaptation. Ideally, DC's best course of action would be to continue to build on Year One, by going to the next peace of the story, Batman: the Long Halloween.",1318982400,6,3315,4.774475524475524
4604992,2,B0058YPN0U,"Please keep in mind that my review comes without having read the graphic novel.

I am not sure what DC is doing, but their Batman only animated movies fall short of their other releases.  With all the amazing plotlines for these characters, I just feel that the wrong choices are being made.
This movie felt very choppy and the plot fell short.  I feel they could have extended the movie (its only 64 minutes) and expanded on the plot.  This is the first DC animated release to have Catwoman, for which I was very excited, and her part in the movie felt like an after thought. She had such a small part that was not relevant to the strory at all.  Even the animated short ""Catwoman"" could not make up for it (however the animation was much better).  She is one of the top fan favorites, probably right below Joker, and they did not do her any justice.

I did enjoy the gritty feel of the film, and that it was aimed to adults more so that kids.",1318982400,4,944,4.269662921348314
4604993,5,B0058YPN0U,"As a fan of DC (mostly pre-New DC Universe, that is), I have to say that this instantly became my favorite DC animated film. It doesn't hurt that it's hands down the most faithful adaptation done of their comics library and based on one of the most powerful stories.

This story focuses very much on the parallel lives of Gordon and Wayne and how they come to be the men we know them.

I don't really have much to say that most of the other reviewers mention, but I would like to say in the 'transformation' scene of Bruce, a line is dropped, but the way the scene works out in the animated version, I think the line's absence makes for a more powerful scene and if it was included, it may have became a little over the top.

This definitely beats All Star, as for some reason McDuffie didn't include perhaps the most important scene in that arc.",1318982400,,846,4.3081761006289305

It was truly faithful to the Graphic novel and had a fantastic Noir feel to it. I noticed some of the characters inner monologs were removed from some scenes, but this wasn't too distracting from the original story. i did notice several differences in the way events played out. but i won't spoil them to those who have yet to see the film or read the comic.

If you are a fan of Batman by any means you need to see this film! and if you haven't read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One/dp/1401207529/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Year One</a>&nbsp;you really need to do so immediately! without the experience of reading Frank Miller's brilliant classic you miss out on the insight and impact it has on all other modern Batman stories.

The short feature ""Catwoman"" included on disc one was fantastic!!!
great action/animation and was very faithful to the Character of Selina kyle.

Disc 2 of the special edition has only one featurette and an episode of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and one from ""The Batman"" both co-starring Catwoman.
Though both cartoons are excellent, many DC collectors such as myself already have these episodes. But if you are new to the market you are in for a treat because these episodes (especially if you like Catwoman) are amazing!

So to Sum it up, i would have loved more features included but this is still an excellent set and i highly recommend the purchase!",1318982400,4,2091,6.32280701754386

Directed by Lauren Montgomery, Sam Liu

Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's seminal comic book series, Batman: Year One, follows the original story of the graphic novel series, makes its way to the animated small screen with this Warner Premiere production.  Enjoy the panel by panel illustrations, brings into focus that Batman is now being targeted more than ever to the adult readers.  This Warner Premiere movie is totally aimed for the fans of the graphic novel.  Gave me chills to see this on the screen, as this has always been one of my favorite tales from the Dark Knight years.

The story follows James Gordon (voice: Bryan Cranston) during his early years on the force just as the vigilante Batman (voice: Ben McKenzie) targets both the corrupt police officials and the crime-ridden streets for a clean-up - another good voice supporting cast Eliza Dushku (voice: Selina Kyle / Catwoman), Jon Polito (voice: Commissioner Loeb), Alex Rocco (voice: Carmine Falcone), Katee Sackhoff (voice: Sarah Essen), Jeff Bennett (voice: Alfred), Saratoga Ballentine (voice: Skeevers' Attorney) - Job well done!

4605037,4,B0058YPN0U,"This movie has the feel and pace of the graphic novel.  I've always had a problem with Warner Brothers Batman animation feeling stiff but I was surprised at the energy and great animation of the fights.  The voice acting is realistic and not over the top.  If the animation was up to Disney or Bluth standards (not their cuteness but fluidity) I'd give this a 5 plus rating.  But within the realm of WB Batman animation, this is one fine movie.  Batman Year One also gives me hope that WB and DC will faithfully adapt more of the well-known Batman stories.",1318896000,,556,4.465346534653466
4605038,5,B0058YPN0U,"Modern animated movies are mostly 3D (often poorly done since majority of them are not done by Pixar) so it's really great to see a traditionally animated flick come out every now and then. The animation quality on this one was astounding, having seen Under The Red Hood an hour prior.

This is a very dark cartoon in the same way that Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were very dark films. There are many mature scenes in it and I really liked it for that. I haven't read the graphic novel from which this movie was adapted but I did read Dark Knight Returns & 300 and I don't think I'm a big fan of Frank Miller. ...but I did really like this story.

I haven't read every Detective Comic nor am I 100% familiar with all the stories surrounding the caped crusader, but I've read and seen enough to think that this is a great product.",1318809600,,835,4.2784810126582276

batman begins ---how many dvds r they going to waste on batman beginning,do sum thing new. do any one agree  17.99 for another beginning---wow",1318636800,9,1006,4.48087431693989
4605040,4,B0058YPN0U,"I've watched several of the DC animated features, but there have been two to date that adapted stories that I held near and dear in my younger days.  The first -- the Death and Return of Superman -- was a huge departure from the original story, and while I understood the logic behind those changes, I found that movie to be a huge disappointment.

This one, however, gets much more right than wrong.  I've read the source material hundreds of times, so of course there are some minor scenes here and there that I wanted to see brought to life.  I was also a bit disappointed with they way McKenzie plays Bruce/Batman -- he sounds too robotic, though I think that was done intentionally to try to portray the tortured individual from the book.  Other choices that stuck out mainly did so because they didn't fit what I've always had in my head for a particular character.  For example, I've always imagined that Commissioner Loeb was intended to basically be Gordon Jump from WKRP, and Alex Rocco as the Roman just sounds way off.  But, these are all minor, and I think this is as good of an adaptation as was possible without making a 4+ hour affair that recreates the original comics scene for scene.  I'd probably still enjoy that, though).

I would imagine that a adaptation of Dark Knight Returns is coming down the road, and I'm excited to see how they pull that one off, too.  I also would love to see Year Two made, though I suppose Mask of the Phantasm was already a pretty good version of that one.",1318550400,9,1508,4.470802919708029
4605041,4,B0058YPN0U,"Not perfect, but a welcome (and smartly executed) entry into DC/WB embracing a darker, grittier Dark Knight.  Viva Frank Miller!!!  BRAVO!!!",1318464000,,140,5.619047619047619
4605042,4,B0058YPN0U,"When it was announced that DC Comics, Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation were going to be adapting the quintessential version of Batman's origins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One/dp/1401207529/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Batman: Year One""</a>, I was completely exhilarated and a bit anxious as to whether or not the story would be done justice in a direct-to-video animated film. Having now seen the highly anticipated new film, I have to say that I am stunned by just how faithful it is. I only detected two minor changes from the Frank Miller story. The first change was that some of the narrative dialogue has been removed or altered to accommodate pacing and action sequences and the second change is that Branden's named was for some reason switched to Brendon. That's it, those are the only significant changes that I noticed and most casual fans probably won't even realize that these alterations have occurred because the story is so compelling and engaging.

From the start, it becomes clear to anyone who hasn't read ""Year One"", that the story is different because it isn't just about Bruce Wayne turning into Batman after twelve years of absence from his home in Gotham. The story focuses as much, if not more, on young Jim Gordon as he and his pregnant wife move to Gotham City where Gordon encounters rampant crime, crooked cops on the police force, and corrupt politicians with ties to the mob. Miller's graphic novel really pays a great deal of attention to the moral dilemmas that the characters face and how they either overcome those dilemmas or fall prey to them. Both Bruce and Gordon are shown to be flawed characters in their personal lives, but as sentinels of justice, they stand tall as examples of the best that people can be in a city where authority is used to oppress the populace and make profit off of the suffering of other.

Now, on to the acting.
Bryan Cranston is, in my mind, perfectly cast as the voice of Gordon and he gives a nuanced and believable vocal performance that captures the character as he appears on the page written by Miller.
Ben McKenzie however doesn't feel absolute as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Part of the problem with his vocal performance is that there is no conviction or urgency to his lines. He simply says them almost in emulation of other actors who have also played the dual role of the playboy billionaire and his Dark Knight alter-ego. One cannot state what an overwhelming challenge it is for any actor to play a character so psychologically complex and so driven as Bruce/Batman. Few actors in the past have managed to do both aspects of the character justice (in fact, I consider voice actor Kevin Conroy and actor Christian Bale to be the only two who managed to make both Bruce Wayne and Batman completely plausible on screen). And for the most part, McKenzie rises to the challenge of his character admirably, but I have some reservations about his depiction of the character. One of them is that McKenzie seems too earnest and green. I realize that this is an early point in Bruce's vigilante career as Batman, but McKenzie feels especially naive in the part and he never possessed the ironic attitude that Bruce Wayne gives to the public. In other scenes, such as the few scenes with Bruce and Alfred, he seems spot-on.
Eliza Dushku provides the voice of Selina Kyle/Catwoman and does a nice job giving her an emotional side, but not overplaying it to the degree of melodrama, and she carefully shades her character with different levels of moral ambiguity and injects the entire persona with a seductive yet violent quality that makes her stand out from all of Batman's enemies (and lovers).

The animation in the film is very modern and utilizes computer graphics and striking camerawork which gives new life to the action scenes (which are usually pretty weak in most animated films that we see in the U.S.). There's a definite Japanese influence here that was in the graphic novel, but it never becomes too apparent or distracting from the story. The style of the animation retains that of the previous DC Universe Animated Movies, but it also pays homage to the colors, angles, and character designs of comic book artist David Mazzucchelli.

I, for one, was impressed with the film as a whole, though I do wish that Conroy had provided Batman's voice. All in all, the film is a welcome addition to the DC animated film collection, in addition to thrilling the casual fans of the Batman character, and hopefully fulfilling the expectations of the diehard comic book community.",1318464000,4,4620,4.926829268292683
