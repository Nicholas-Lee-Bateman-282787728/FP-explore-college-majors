1131262,4,7885142671,Love the version of the Shaolin templeb emergence. Jackie Chang was great. Great fight scenes. Andy Lau was superb! Highly recommended!,1313366400,,135,5.476190476190476
1131263,5,7885142671,I recently went to China.  I saw this movie on the plane. I loved it. There are so many Chinese movies that we never see here in the States.  I'm glad this one was available.,1313193600,,174,3.942857142857143
1131264,5,7885142671,"I could not wait to get my hands on this film. A collaboration with Andy Lau and Jackie Chan, what more could I ask for? OK, let's throw in Bing Bing Fan, Jacky Wu and Nicholas Tse and make it a movie about the Shaolin temple, Buddhism and martial arts. Score!

This movie is beyond excellent. Andy Lau has the lead role and carries it effortlessly. Jackie Chan's role is minor in comparison but memorable. Nicholas Tse plays a pitch-perfect role as Lau's protege that learns ruthlessness and lust for power at his master's knee and karma comes back to bite Lau pretty darn hard. When Lau loses everything, he finds himself taken in at the Shaolin temple and learns what forgiveness and redemption really mean.

Of course, it wouldn't be a good kung fu movie without some fighting, so the bad guys have to come defile the temple and the monks must defend it from Tse and his cohorts. We are treated to some truly amazing and wonderful martial arts fighting here, right down to the littlest monks. And Chan the cook teaches the bad guys a thing or two about how to roll dough. Dramatic, action-packed, humorous, touching and heart-warming all come to mind when I think of this movie. It is destined to be a classic.",1311638400,41,1214,4.538812785388128

When I try to get friends and family to watch (whatever label you want)Hong Kong/martial arts/Kung Fu/Asian action films, this one will make the short list of ""you gotta see this"".  For me it joins the list of Red cliff, Crouching tiger, hidden dragon, IP man, House of flying daggers, Hero and The Banquet.  I highly recommend this movie.",1309132800,8,487,4.831325301204819
1131267,5,7885142671,"This is the first collaboration between Jackie Chan and Andy Lau since Drunken Master 2 in 1994 and it does not disappoint. Its a huge budget film from director Benny Chan, but he finally got it right in this one. Story is good, and action scenes are incredible. Fights are pretty realistic with minimal use of wires. Fights are very well choreographed. Great film, and highly recommended for martial arts/action fans. The DVD I bought from Loto Surplus was excellent. Very high quality video and sound.

The practices of the Shaolin priests and their compassion towards those less fortunate was outstanding!  This seems to be just what is missing in today's so called ""culture.""  I was particularly impressed with the show of non-judgmental positions that can be taken regarding those that have wronged innocent people and have been brought down off of their egotistical high horses, back down to earth; humbled. this is a great movie for those who think they have it all: fame; ill gotten money, stolen property; and the delusional attitude that nothing can harm them because of their ""money...""

1131961,5,7885142671,"Fascinating epic with beautiful martial arts scenes. Gives at least some historical insight into the Shaolin Temple, which has been destroyed and rebuilt more than once, ""Martial Zen"" and the culture of the monks inside, alongside the murderous removal of Chinese artifacts for European museums under sleazy and scandalous circumstances.

The lead actor and actress and main supporting actor are splendid and their characters are unique and fairly well developed.

The story is by turns dramatic, epic, tragic, heartwarming, moving, and entertaining. Jackie Chan has a touching supportive role.

The Temple Abbot is the epitome of life time commitment to martial arts and meditation, an elder who is compassionate and wise who also holds his own in a fight is and far from frail, and there's a wonderful scene at about 1:07 involving a repenting former warlord who is learning deep reflection, practicing with a school-aged monk who is already very proficient on a cold night while the Abbot and the Cook watch on, unnoticed. For me this scene is touching in how much the man misses his own daughter, but gets along with such sweetness with the boy, who holds his own with the adult, and watching them moving in sync is rather beautiful.

It's a violent action blockbuster, combined with historical fiction, combined with family and village drama, combined with the humble grandeur and legend of Shaolin.

Is it perfectly accurate in its depiction of things in all details? Likely not, but how it approaches and blends so many elements is fascinating and rewarding, with themes of sin and redemption and our shared humanity that are woven throughout but in ways that are not heavy handed.",1418860800,2,1688,5.057553956834532
1131962,5,7885142671,"Good movie, the story kept my interest all the way thru the movie. Liked all the Kung Fu action scenes in the movie.

1131966,5,7885142671,"This is hands down the best movie I have seen in a while- the plot is outstanding, as is the acting.  I really don't watch movies for the ""action"", so I can't comment one way or another on that.

It is as though someone took the best elements of an art/independant film and combined them with the best elements of the plot structure of an old school kung fu movie (and in fact this a remake of a 1982 shaw brothers film- although this version is a lot less kung fu theater-y).

If you are a fan of movies with deep meaning, or films about buddhism, this movie is for you.

I watched this on demand solely as a chance to work on my Cantonese.  I was pleasantly surprised by a very gripping tale of personal redemption, as well as a meditation on what is truly important in life.

1132099,4,7885142671,"The Shaolin temple has long been a place of refuge and respite and the famed monks the people's protectors and servants.  This movie finds the monks attempting to be pacifists in the face of a ruthless warlord moving through town and making pacts with western governments that will increase both their and his power within China's verdant valleys.  The warlord is wounded, though, and where once he laid siege to the Shaolin monastery he now finds himself the beneficiary of the monk's care.  As time is taken for his body and spirit to heal the devious plots of the other power brokers play out until duplicity strips many of their lives and the monks are decimated in a bloodbath that they are forced to fight in in order to protect the people.

You would think that this type of movie would employ more west versus east fighting with the warlords relying more heavily than they do on western weaponry rather than their hand-to-hand prowess but you'd be wrong.  There certainly is the explicit evil of the advanced western machinery of destruction, but the soldiers are no slouches to employing their fists and feet in the service of subjugation.  Thus we get an ample amount of fighting, some of it rueful and bitterly violent, and some of it delightful and laughable (as when the monastery boys fight in a child's inimitably small style and Jackie Chan, here portrayed as a kindhearted but mentally limited strongman, uses his wok to rock heads).  This is a decent Hong Kong actioner and worth the time for those who eat this stuff up.  But as has been said before, fans of Chan (who is featured prominently on the cover) need to look elsewhere to watch him in a starring role as this movie has him in but a small supporting role.

Ultimately the bad guys are generally unsympathetic and rueful characters except for warlord Hou Jie (played by veteran Andy Lau) who goes through a painful redemption.  The Shaolin monks are a bit more nuanced as they show more emotional hostility and distrust and less intuitiveness than normal.  For those looking only for slam bang kung fu action they will get some but may overall be disappointed by more story than they're expecting.",1402444800,,2175,4.727513227513228

1132102,3,7885142671,"I enjoyed the movie. Storyline on how the protagonist (Andy Lau) evolves his life's missions after a tragic family situation was reasonably believable. However, hard to fathom the villain's killing of the laborers as that will surely result in less labor availability. Sufficient time spent on the Shaolin monks and their restraint helps sustain the movie outside the fighting scenes. Latter was generally well done, and had enough variations and other supporting characters fighting that makes it interesting. I would rank as 3.5 stars (meaning I would see this again after a lapse of about 9-12 months).

1132301,3,7885142671,"Better-than-average action film with the usual choreographed martial arts battles.  But I was hoping for more, thinking that the Shaolin angle would have provided a little more sophistication of the story than it did.  In fact, the monks were used for comic relief as much as anything else, which was a little disappointing.  Not that I didn't chuckle a bit, but the Shaolin angle seemed it should have been better utilized.  While there was a little ""insight into human nature"" that I was hoping for in the final resolution, I had hoped for more, or something a little more profound.  It was all pretty formulaic, really.  You could do worse, but they could do better.  The story was the weak point I would say, including the overdependence on the standard choreographed and unrealistic action.  Good guys and bad guys.  Otherwise the effects and camerawork were quite good.

Such action movies appear to be the equivalent of the Westerns of the '40s and '50s with modern production values.  Eventually,  westerns started to expand outside the box, push the boundaries, and discard the old standard formulas.  Films like the the original 3:10 to Yuma, the Hired Hand, the spaghetti westerns and others of that opened up the field and didn't need to rely on unrealistic stereotypical gunfights to keep them interesting.  Who was a good guy and who was a bad guy was blurred, struggles with moral ambiguities, etc., more like real life.  Though there are some transitions in Shaolin, it's still pretty black and white when the all bad guy suddenly turns all good guy.  Hopefully better plots are on their way and we'll see some of that sophistication happen with the martial arts movies (or happen again, as I figure many of the classic samurai films qualify).  Or maybe it has been happening, and I simply mistook Shaolin for one of them.  As great movies go, Shaolin is certainly no High Noon.  Patience is touted as one of the Buddhist virtues here, but little patience can be seen in the plot.",1377907200,,1996,4.80058651026393
1132302,5,7885142671,"What a beautifully crafted film. The ""sins of the father"", or in this case ""the brother"", are often passed on. Redemption is possible, but only at great cost. The acting is superb, especially that of Andy Lau. He is so believable and his character's journey is as ""real"" as I've ever seen. He is captivating and fills the screen with heart and soul in every scene he is in. I can't do justice to what he has done here. Early on, he is power hungry and fearful of loss. He clearly loves his family, but resorts to treachery to ""protect"" his world and them. Everything quickly unravels, at the hands of his younger brother who has learned from him... all too well.
  The cinematography is gorgeous, the supporting cast are all at the top of their game- and what a cast it is. The kung fu is great, but the action sequences are always in support of the story, which is unusual for big budget films, whether Chinese or American.

It is no secret that I am a huge Martial arts fan, from being an actual practitioner all the way to movies and such. Now any martial arts fan out there knows of Shaolin I am sure, from the actual history to the films in which this place and its people are portrayed. This is another in a list of films dedicated to the destruction of one of the temples. There have been many before this and I am sure there are more to come. Most people know of the old school ones back in the day and even one that came a little later that gave us a young Jet Li. The Li film is what this one is loosely based on from what I can tell. Also it should be noted that the actual Shaolin Monastery supported this film.

Set during the Warlord Era of China in the 1900's the film tells the story of General Hou [Andy Lau] a warlord who wants more [don't they all]. We start with Hou entering the Shaolin Temple chasing down a rival warlord and despite the Monks pleas to leave the man be and show mercy he murders the man inside the Temple walls. In an effort to seize control of more power an assassination attempt on a warlord named Song Hu goes wrong when Hou's second in command Cao Man [Nicholas Tse] betrays him. While trying to escape Hou's daughter becomes fatally injured. In a desperate attempt to save her he takes her to the very Monks he disrespected at the Shaolin Monastery. While they do try to save her it is for nothing as she is too far gone his wife blames him for this and leaves him, he has lost everything. While he is full of anger and has lead a life contradictory to that of the Monks he is given sanctuary there. But his past may still catch up with him as Cao Man will not rest until he is dead.

For those who don't know this film was directed by Benny Chan and I have to say that this may very well be his best film. Chan has been know as more of a style or action driven type director, but here he really comes through with the dramatic elements as well. But much like Woopak said it helps when you have actors who can help carry the film. Andy Lau is our lead and he does an excellent job here. He is believable as the power hungry warlord and as the changing man looking for peace after losing everything.

Fan Bingbing is great as well as Hou's wife and it shows especially in scenes in which she blames her husband for their daughter's death. I really enjoyed Nicholas Tse here though as the lead villain after turning on Hou. He plays a very ruthless character that goes for what he wants at all costs. Then of course there is Jackie Chan who I am sure a lot of people will see this for him. Chan is great here as well in a supporting role playing a cook at the temple. His character has a lot to do with Hou coming to terms with what has happened, a good light dramatic role for Chan.

Then of course there are the action and fight scenes here and I have to say that the film excels in that department. When the action hits in this film it really hits and is very exciting, from straight action as in things going boom and guns being discharged all the way to the fights. Any martial arts fan will enjoy the fight scenes in this flick although sometimes the wire work is a little too obvious. Still there is nothing like good martial arts being displayed and it is here. The last part of the film in particular will please any action fan in my opinion.

Now not everything is great here but even the things I am about to mention don't take too much away from the film. Chan is really proving himself with this film but sometimes the direction seems a bit off. Some things are not fully explored to the fullest [I do understand this though since the film is already 2 + hours] like the Monks who pull ""Iron Monkey"" duties in stealing rice and such and giving them out to the poor town's people. It shows why they do it and why they stop since they are punished for stealing since it goes against their ways. But I felt like a little more from them would have been fun. Also the wire work is always fun and great to look at but in a film that is mostly based in reality sometimes the wire work seems out of place.

In the end I would say that this film is an epic but falls just a little short of classic status in my opinion. But who knows time may be a good thing for this film as it is already good. I may change my mind years from now and in fact you may disagree and label it classic now. It all depends on the person I guess. What I will say now is I really do like this film and think it is very good, and may be Benny Chan's best.",1355270400,,4560,4.082589285714286

1132648,5,7885142671,"I came across Shaolin at a used movie shop yesterday and it was quite a great find. There is breathtaking action, heart-wrenching drama, thoughtful spirituality, and gorgeous cinematography of China. The movie is not a pure action romp nor is it a period-piece costume drama. It brings the best elements of both however, as well as elements that made some of the great crossover hits like Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and House of Flying Daggers so great. There are perfectly placed laughs, tender moments of love and loss, and brutal scenes of cruelty. Being that it is a story of Shaolin monks battling external forces, there are also many philosophical nuggets to be mined, and I found these welcome and moving treasures.

Andy Lau does a great job portraying the general whose life is transformed and I've not seen Jackie Chan used so perfectly in a long while, if ever. Moreover, the characters are given depth and unexpected trajectories that were a refreshing break from the predictable.

The movie clocks in at slightly over two hours and paces itself well. Additionally, it contains nearly forty-five minutes of deleted scenes including some poignant scenes and sub-plots that would've made the movie that much better. It was a smart decision to include them and give the viewer the chance to see a larger and more fully developed vision.

While the plot is anything but novel, the scenery and cinematography are excellent. The spirit of Buddhism is very well portrayed.

On another note, While the movie has a strong component of Buddhist philosophy, which advocates respect for all living things, I did notice that a lot of horses were used in stunts.

I am hoping that the Hong Kong/ Chinese movie industry is a believer in protecting animal rights and in ensuring the safety of animals.

1132652,5,7885142671,"The story arc isn't really original, but Shaolin executes the arc strongly, and the main character has solid dynamic development.

This movie isn't non-stop action, but that's actually what I like about it. I hate when action movies have pointless action scenes. Action is cool, but viewers need a reason to be watching the action. I want to use Hero (with Jet Li) as an example of pointless action. Sure, it's wonderfully fun to watch performers fly through the air; but if you know who's going to win, then there's no tension or reason for the fight. Action scenes are most effective when they advance the plot or develop the characters. Each action sequence in Shaolin serves to push the story foward, or demonstrate the way characters are changing in personality.

Spoiler alert - people die in the fight sequences, and it's very important for Shaolin. It's not that I love watching death, but when these characters die, the plot changes. Each action scene features plot twists. Every character death has an emotional effect on the other characters in the movie, and the characters then use that information to make new decisions. This movie is serious, smart, and emotional.

One critique: Jackie Chan's appearance in the movie is actually jarring. He's the comic relief in what is a pretty dark movie with a decent amount of murder. I love Jackie Chan, and his dialogue is good, but his fight scenes are standard Jackie Chan fun in a movie where it seems out of place. But whatever... it's Jackie Chan, so he can do what he wants.

This movie IS NOT a non-stop, beat-em-up, kung-fu-focused, fight-for-no-reason kind of movie, so if you wanted that, you might want to avoid.

If you're looking for a movie with a really sad story about a warlord who comes to realize the error of his ways, with some great fight-sequences mixed in, then Shaolin works. You're gonna feel sad at the end, though. I see a lot of parallels in story arc to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, and Little Big Soldier.

1132654,5,7885142671,"*NOTE: This review is for the ""Shaolin (Collector's Edition) [Blu-Ray]"".  Amazon merged reviews with another edition that is Blu-Ray + DVD combo.

This is a beautifully made film with a compelling story and profound meaning. There is everything in this film: realistic kung-fu actions, human greed/power, undeniable love for family, and seeing an absolutely cold-hearted person becoming all heart. Andy Lau was the star so was Jackie Chan (as special guest) and other supporting actors. One can argue this is a drama-first (my believe), and action second.

The package comes with a blu-ray and a DVD. blu-ray comes with two Chinese audio tracks (5.1 and stereo), and two English audio tracks (5.1 and stereo).  The main menu says the Chinese is Cantonese dialect, but both tracks are Mandarin. There is subtitle for English and Spanish as well. The English 5.1 seems to have better fidelity and decoding to all 5.1 speakers than the Chinese 5.1 version overall. The English dialog is translated well. The English subtitle is slightly different, but also translated very well. This is pretty rare. Kudos to the translators.

The Full HD (1080p) is clean, detailed, sharp but properly softened as needed in the right places.

As far as special features on the blu-ray, the deleted scenes are LONG and have pretty interesting ""side stories"". Many are actually quite significant to properly develop characters and bring out the strength of the overall story, but I can understand the movie would've been close to 3 hours long!  There are also two international trailers.

The second disc is a DVD, and it contains additional bonus materials.  There are interviews of the cast and director, and behind the scene clips and documentaries. The interviews are in Mandarin and Cantonese dialects (no English).",1327536000,23,1799,5.133561643835616
1132655,4,7885142671,"For most action film fans, the name of Shaolin is almost synonymous with Chinese martial arts action movies, especially the 1982 film starring Jet Li (then known as Li Lianjie). Despite its title, the new 2011 film ""Shaolin"" is neither a remake nor a sequel to the groundbreaking film made about 30 years ago. Though the action-packed new version (with the gorgeous set of the Shaolin temple) is entertaining, those who are looking for originality in action may be disappointed.

Set in 1912, immediately after the Xinhai Revolution, the story of ""Shaolin"" centers around a proud and ruthless warlord Hou Jie (Andy Lau) attempting to get rid of his sworn brother General Song Hu (Shi Xiaohong), whom he no longer trusts. But his plans go terribly awry when Hou Jie's trusted second-in-command Cao Man (Nicholas Tse) has come up with another plan unknown to him.

Directed by Benny Chan (""Who Am I?"" ""New Police Story""), ""Shaolin"" provides lots of action stunts including one rousing chase scene. They are expertly choreographed, but each sequence (in the second half of the film in particular) tends to be shorter than it should be, and sometimes dependent on big and loud explosions, which I think is antithesis to martial arts action.

Andy Lau is a gifted actor, and so is Nicholas Tse. I know they are not required to show Jet Li's physical prowess, but the name of Shaolin is something special for martial arts film fans. For them the filmmakers wisely hired Wu Jing and Yu Xing (both former martial arts practitioners) as Shaolin monks, and a veteran actor/choreographer Xin Xin Xiong as a deadly assassin. Even Yu Hai (seen in Jet Li's ""The Shaolin Temple"") has come back from retirement as the Shaolin abbot. All of them are given a chance to show what they can do, but perhaps Benny Chan could have given them more screen time.

Fan Bingbing as Hou Jie's wife is not required to do much except look sad and cry. Jackie Chan fares slightly better as a cook living in the Shaolin monastery, but his action sequence is not a big one.

Very emotionally stirring!",1323734400,2,703,4.415384615384616

1132865,2,7885142671,"This is a great movie. However, the description is wrong, it is supposed to have Mandarin audio. It does not. It only has Cantonese and English audio. The back of the box also says Mandarin audio so apparently the manufacturer screwed this up. If it had the correct audio, I would have given it 5 stars.",1323216000,5,303,4.428571428571429
1132866,5,7885142671,"Concept, script, production, acting, disk quality, all great.
This is a good example of movies coming out of China today.
Even many of those before today's leap in quality are vastly
entertaining and informative.

These are not in order of my preference; all, in their own way,
are superb. I'm an international collector. Many China films
are from 'way back; they're not as slick, but have many very
special elements, such as extraordinary, authentic venues and
concepts. As China's on the rise, films are a great way to come
to understand this intense 5000+ years-old country; to see its
future by seeing its past.",1322956800,2,2049,10.396648044692737
1132867,5,7885142671,"It is a new age to be able to watch a Chinese film and be pleased it doesn't have funny sounds and over-acting.  The view was beautiful,  the high quality of the film.  I love seeing Jackie Chan even if it isn't a leading role.",1322438400,,227,4.0
1132868,4,7885142671,"Jackie Chan was ok as an actor, he did not steal the show, however, the other actors were very good. Great story line.  I'm into kung fu pic again. Started with Ip Man!",1319068800,5,168,4.090909090909091
1132869,5,7885142671,"Knowing the budget was limited, I think it's incredible that the filmmakers achieved a $100 million look for the movie! The action is over the top and I only wish Jackie Chan had been in the movie a little longer. I highly recommend ""Shaolin""!",1317600000,7,243,4.545454545454546
1132870,4,7885142671,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - and there are some great visual feasts.  The final assault on the temple is a spectacular bit.  Great performance by Andy Lau.  Jackie Chan is in a minor supporting role.

My only complaint - the British soldiers portrayed as one dimensional buffoons.",1317254400,3,285,4.875
1132871,5,7885142671,"I read how a lot people complain about the kung fu being over the top an all that other nonsense. Look past what your seeing and feel what the film is about. Its about how men no matter how bad can have a second chance to do right and how just that one man with firm conviction can change the hearts of others. Take responsibility for your actions know how their are consequences for your wrongful deeds but know that if you try and give yourself to your beliefs you will have a place in the next life. Thats what i got from it and was almost moved to tears because I got what the movie was about. The action was now where the high point,this was a film about heart. I mean no disrespect to the people that gave it a bad review but thats the problem with a lot of films out there,and to many times we are bombarded with junk with a plot no more complicated than a $2 porno. I going to buy more copies for a few of my friends into these kind of films because the care about story more so than action.",1316995200,,999,4.025125628140704
1132872,2,7885142671,"Imagine a Hollywood production imitating a Chinese film company energetically trying to mimic a Hollywood movie production of a typical Chinese warring generals film. That's the most imaginative image in SHAOLIN, which knocks off every device every which way.

There's non-stop sentimental posturing and resurrections of most every cliche' of Chinese battle field genre. So much so that the star power of Jackie Chan and Andy Lau curdles into melodramatic geysers of tears and splattering blood which will become more and more familiar as SHAOLIN goes where everyone has gone before. Don't be surprised if a giggle or two escapes you. Especially when arch villains suddenly become contrite faced with syrupy beatitudes. Terrible, ghastly villains are suddenly, amazingly transformed by virtuous monks sacrificing themselves - and many innocent kids and peasants - while noble monks (some pushing ten years old) are righteous perfection, forgiving and self-sacrificing. Most scenes are overplayed, camped up. Too much too often.

Martial arts' action is very familiar, frantic and pushed 'way past believability. There's
even a pushy imperialist military armament salesman caricature who sneers and struts and spouts
arrogant imperialistic jingoisms. Toned down and made more pompous the bit could've been funny; but as is it's just too heavy-handed.

In all, SHAOLIN is more of a cartoon that an period action
feature. For me, a really big over-the-top disappointment.",1315440000,,1468,5.544642857142857
1132873,5,7885142671,"SHAOLIN proves once again that the path to enlightenment is strewn with Kiiii-yaaaaahhhh!!! It also demonstrates that karma is a mother, ain't that so, General Hou Jie? SHAOLIN, the latest in a long line of period martial arts films, probably won't be quite the critic's darling that CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was, but it should turn plenty of heads. It's epic enough. And aren't you yet convinced that Andy Lau is a hell of a charismatic actor? His character arc makes for a pretty compelling watch.

Set in the early 20th century, shortly after the collapse of imperial reign, China's young republic is threatened by warring warlords eager to carve out their own territories. One such is the prideful, ruthless General Hou Jie (Andy Lau) who had just conquered the town of Dengfeng, in Henan. But uneasy drapes the mantle of power, and when one plays the game of thrones, expect the unexpected. Hou Jie, concerned with an ally's true intentions, plots to destroy him, except that he himself is double-crossed. Barely escaping with his life, Hou Jie seeks the sanctuary of the Shaolin temple, which is sort of cheeky, since this is the very same temple he had ridiculed days before. But when one plummets from such lofty heights, one must simply lump it. Hou Jie reflects on the evil he has committed and vows to attain a monk's serenity, never mind that, days before, he had picked up the temple's sign and sneeringly scrawled ""is no big deal"" after its declaration: ""The Birthplace of Martial Arts.""

This isn't a Jackie Chan vehicle. Jackie does have a part, except that, now in his mid-fifties, it may be that his action lead days are on the wane. SHAOLIN is a serious drama more so than it is an action film, and Jackie provides the much-needed levity. To quote the seldomly quotable Steven Seagal, Jackie in this film is ""just a cook."" But his Shaolin temple cook plays a pivotal role in Hou Jie's transition from cruel warlord to tranquil monk.

SHAOLIN is loosely based on 1982's THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE, the classic what debuted some teenager named Jet Li. Except that Andy Lau isn't an accomplished wushu master like Jet Li. But he IS an accomplished actor, and director Benny Chan plays to his strengths. SHAOLIN is character- and story-driven and the fighty fights that crop up spool naturally off story development. That's not to say that the action sequences aren't spectacular, because they very much are jaw-dropping stuff, gravity-defying stuff. Two highlights are the Shaolin children springing into action and Jackie Chan's one fighting showcase which makes inventive use of cooking utensils. There is also a harrowing nighttime carriage chase by the cliffside that is brilliantly executed and damn intense.

Awesomely, the real-life, more than 1500 years old Shaolin Temple gave this film its blessing. And with the film crew having erected a full-sized temple replica, the weight of revered history is palpable. The story lends gravity and sense of place, and you believe these monks on camera, and their belief in their principles and their righteousness. Even though SHAOLIN focuses predominantly on the deposed General, it blocks out screen time for the supporting actors. I really liked the two headstrong young monks who agonize over the monastery's dwindling supplies - because Shaolin had been taking in starving refugees - and they resort to covert Robin Hood tactics. I wish that this sub-plot had gone on longer. But these benevolent outlaws don't escape the observant eye of the Senior Brother, another character I enjoyed. I will say that the gorgeous Fan Bingbing, who plays Hou Jie's wife, is criminally underused.

Meditations on Shaolin philosophies such as turning the other cheek and the futility of violence - and the selfless grace to help a fellow man for no reason other than to help him - color the narrative, and even when the film's second half dissolves into a series of brutal action set pieces, the theme of redemption courses thru to the end. Buddha gets praised a lot, which is fine.

The nits are ripe, just right for picking: There's a nationalistic streak. Maybe someday, China will make a martial arts film without portraying foreign white devils as utter tools. But that's not today, and not in this movie. And listening to these treasure-hunting Brits spout off the same old tired dialogue may draw snickers. One of the harder selling points is the film's contention that Hou Jei, in such a brief span of time, could rise to a prominent leadership role within the temple hierachy. Of course, I'm assuming that not much time had elapsed. The film doesn't really make this clear. Still, you cannot fault Andy Lau's skillful performance. He's so convincing as the cruel General that at some point I expected him to sacrifice his own family on the altar of self-interest, and yet he's equally credible when he converts to Shaolin and sheds his old self. His young daughter goes a long ways in humanizing him with one simple laughing scribble: ""Daddy likes to fight."" It takes Hou Jie one step closer to attaining Zen. But it's a bloody, roundabout way.",1315094400,40,5106,4.903935185185185
