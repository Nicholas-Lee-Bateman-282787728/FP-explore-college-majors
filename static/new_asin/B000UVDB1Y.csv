8215061,1,B000UVDB1Y,"This DVD contains outstanding examples of how not to teach any subject. the instructor reads definitions straight out of his notes and then does a poor job of showing examples. It is also extreemly dry instruction. If a person wants to see how to suck any interest or enthusiasm from a subject of instruction, this is the DVD for you.",1223856000,,334,4.583333333333333
8215062,5,B000UVDB1Y,"As a parent, I wanted to make sure my kids were exposed to Probability and Statistics before these topics were introduced in class. I purchased the tutorials and they were excellent. My kids are getting excellent grades in math and I'm regarded as a ""mathematican"" in my neighborhood, teaching other parents how to do statistics.  This is an excellent product.",1207699200,,360,5.0
8215063,1,B000UVDB1Y,"When reading product reviews, it helps to know what the reviewer had in mind when she or he bought/used the product. So, I first present my reasons for buying this, and the way I used it, and I then offer my assessment.

HOW I GOT TO BUY THIS: I am a PhD in political science from Europe. As most European political scientists, I was not particularly well-trained either in formal methods (maths) or in quantitative techniques (statistics). Feeling the immensity of the gap between my training and my ambitions, I recently embarked on a re-tooling program. My goal was to become a true social scienists. I therefore had to take up maths from where I left it when I was 17... While continuing to work on my stuff, I bought a bundle of books and DVDs: first, books for careful study and exercise material, and then DVDs to increase my motivation when I felt tired. This bundle included the ""Teach Yourself"" books on algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics, and the ""Dummies"" book on probability. I also bought most of Jason Gibson's fantastic DVDs on maths (from Algebra 2 to, most recently, Calculus 3). The only course I had no DVD for was statistics, and I therefore bought this DVD.

MY IMPRESSION: Well, ... that IS A BIG-TIME DISAPPOINTMENT. I have committed the ecological fallacy: judging from the ""teach yourself"" books and the ""Jason Gibson"" DVDs, I thought this one would be just as great. How wrong I was... (1) First of all, the presenter looks as utterly bored when teaching as some of my unionized teachers at high school. Quelle galere!!! Does he not understand that people who buy this kind of products are basically looking for a motivating coach? The guy is just reading from his notes. Frankly, I think that most of us can do that on our own... (2) Second, there is no guiding of the audience through what is being said: a lot of information is just thrown at you, without ever telling you how the argument will build up, or how it may be relevant for specific research tasks. (3) Third, the level of analysis is extremely superficial. I do not only mean that there are no proofs or detailed examples; I also mean that there is a total absence of pedagogical tricks to make you ""feel"" the concepts. When you go to work with these tools, you find that nnothing has stuck in your mind, and that you need to read a book to really ""get it"".

RECOMMENDATIONs: (1) Do not buy this DVD: spare yourself the money and the time. (2) Instead, read a basic statistics book that takes you up to the CLT. I found the ""Teach Yourself"" book more motivating than this DVD. For political scientists, the basic SAGE little volumes such as Lewis-Beck are much better and .. funnier (sic!). (3) Send letters to jason Gibson asking him to urgently add to his series a DVD on statistics!",1204156800,5,2790,4.598393574297189
