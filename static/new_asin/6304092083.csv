7861362,5,6304092083,"Hoi Polloi - Well, I think every stooge fan knows the story behind this all-time classic. Two professors make a wager on what makes a gentleman--environment or heredity--and soon the stooges are taken on a crash course into becoming gentlemen. This is a definitive stooge classic and one I would probably show to the  uninitiated to convert them into stoogedom. 5 stars easily.

A Gem of a Jam - Not too good. I think this was the beginning of Del Lord actually co-writing his shorts as well as directing and--for the most part--the results were less than stellar. The first half of this one is pretty good, but right after the operation--when the boys start running from the cops--things go downhill, although comic actor Dudley Dickerson provides a few laughs with his scare reactions. 2 1/2 stars

Half-Shot Shooters - Now things get back on track. This is definitely the funniest ""army"" short the boys did and I for one love the ending when the stooges get blown away and the slow-mo pan to the smoking boots. I know a lot of stooge fans have trouble with the ending to this one, but it never fails to put me in stitches. A great short. 5 stars

Overall, two great shorts with a mediocre one sandwiched in between, but still a five star collection in my book.",1355529600,,1263,4.575221238938053
7861363,4,6304092083,"This tape begins with an advertisement for other Three Stooges VHS tapes featuring the novelty song ""The Curly Shuffle."" However, unlike many advertisements, this one does not spoil any of the films on the tape.

All of the shorts feature Moe, Larry, and Curly.

This tape begins with Hoi Polloi from 1935. It begins with two aristocratic men arguing about whether heredity or environment is the deciding factor in a man's behavior. The two make a bet forcing the one in favor of environment to transform three ordinary men into those from high society. Of course, the stooges are chosen. This film features a great scene where the three are learning to dance, when the teacher gets a bee down her dress. They follow her ""dancing"" with hilarious results. Also, there is a clever bit where Curly gets a spring attached to the back of his suit, and when he falls, he bounces back into standing position. Watch closely to see that the spring keeps growing.

A Gem of a Jam is from 1943 and features the men as assistants at a doctor's office. When one of three gangsters gets shot in the shoulder, the stooges are forced to operate. As in many shorts, the boys make up new elaborate names for medical tools. This film also features a funny dancing scene when Moe gets a radio wire in his pants and Curly and Larry join in on his frantic pacing. There is a beautifully photographed shot of the stooges running away down a hallway far in the background. Overall, this is a fun short.

The last on the tape is Half-Shot Shooters from 1936. The stooges have been driving their sergeant crazy, so he really lets them have it, only resulting in their being awarded medals for sustaining injuries during the war. Since they no longer have to serve, they beat up their sergeant. Later, when the boys are down on their luck during the Great Depression, they go into a building looking for a job, but end up re-enlisting in the army under the same sergeant. He decides to get revenge. The boys sing several times in harmony for comic effect in this film; Curly even sings a line (changed slightly for the situation) of ""The Music Goes Round and Round,"" a popular song of the time. The ending is quite funny and employs slow-motion, a technique rarely used in the series.",1128643200,,2257,4.579207920792079

7861365,2,6304092083,"The only things that save this tape are HOI POLLOI and the second half of A GEM OF A JAM.
HOI POLLOI (1935) is the earliest Three Stooges short that I would give an A rating. It's hilarious and has great gags. There's only one thing missing, a great pie fight. It mentions on the back of the box that there was a scene where Moe threw a creampuff, but it got stuck in someone's throat. The scene ended up getting deleated, probably for time. This should've been nominated for an academy award.
A GEM OF A JAM (1943) was an okay short. This first half wasn't too good and was very slow paced. But it picks up in the second half, mainly because of Dudley Dickerson, who plays a watchman. The ending was hilarious, when Dickerson crashes through the door and runs at the speed of light.
HALF-SHOT SHOOTERS (1936), well, it's hard to say this, but in my opinion, this is the worst Three Stooges film ever made. I can't think of ONE part that is funny. And who want to see our favorite comedians, the Stooges, get killed by a cannon. Right from the beginning, when the Stooges are asleep during the war, to the end, the short is not funny. I simply cannot watch this short. Parts of this short's story line were reused in BOOBS IN ARMS (1940) which was a better short, and a lot funnier. My rating: F
Overall, the first short was great, the middle one was okay, and the third was just plain BAD. It's two bad HALF-SHOT SHOOTERS has to be stuck between two great shorts, MOVIE MANIACS (1936) and DISORDER IN THE COURT (1936).",1007596800,2,1519,4.333333333333333
7861366,4,6304092083,"HOI POLLOI (1935) - A classic short! This had a very clever premise (a spoof of ""Pygmalion"") which would be reused with the Stooges countless times in the future. The ending is definitely hilarious. One of the Stooges best.
A GEM OF A JAM (1943) - Quite weak. This hardly had any plot, but doesn't have that much funny gags to back it up. Del Lord's usual excellent directorial efforts slipped noticably around this period. Dudley Dickerson was hilarious as usual, though, as the security guard. ""What?!! Who's gonna grab who?!!""
HALF SHOT SHOOTERS (1936) - A great short. Also, one of the more violent Stooge shorts, with the Stooges getting vicious revenge on their former Sarge, the examination scenes (watch for that 'gun-in-the-troft' scene), and the ending with the Stooges being killed by a cannon. The premise was semi-reused again in BOOBS IN ARMS, which I thought was better and is my favorite Stooge short. Also, Holland would not allow this short to screen in their country for some reason.",994204800,5,1002,4.8654970760233915
