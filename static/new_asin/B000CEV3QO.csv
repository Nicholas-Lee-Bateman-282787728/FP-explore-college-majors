Ah My Goddess Season 2 just has started this April in Japan. So far, about 15 episodes were aired (an episode per week). Those new episodes were only broadcasted, but not put into DVD yet (07/2006). We all hope we can watch the new season of Goddess series soon in the U.S.  By the way the U.S. version of AMG season 1 ends at volume 6 with 26 episodes.

This volume 4 of AMG season 1 contains four episodes. The first episode introduces an important sidekick of the series, Banpei the robot. The second and third episodes are more interesting, because Belldandy shows her somewhat scary side of personality. The last episode is the big shot of this volume, Belldandy in bathing suit.

The first episode is about Banpei. He is made for protecting Belldandy. From what? And, by whom? The second question is easy to answer. Skuld, who else? But, the answer for the first question is a bit complicated. Skuld intended Banpei to help and protect Belldandy, but for some reason the robot himself changed his own program coding, so that he now protects Belldandy from everybody who approaches to her including keiichi, urd, and even his creator Skuld. Although Skuld did not install any emotional function on the robot, urd concluded that Banpei is in love with Belldandy.

The second episode is funny. After Banpei is guarding and patrolling the temple 24-7, Mara, the demon, has hard time to attack Keiichi and Belldandy. Because Banpei is equipped with anti air-strike missiles, wide range demon detector, and rock music broadcasting function that can make Mara down tens of times a day, she has no chance to even get near to their house. So, Mara changes her target and employs dirtier tactics. She finds megumi, keiichi's sister, and possesses her body to hide from Belldandy's detection. Behind Megumi's body Mara succeeded in approaching to the couple and casts a strong spell to keiichi. The result is that keiichi does some misdeeds to other girls that can potentially disappoint Belldandy. First he jumps to Sayoko on her body, next he grasps Megumi's breast, and finally plunges into lady's dress room where Hasegawa is changing her clothes. The scary but interesting part is the super natural repercussion caused by Belldandy. Each time when she saw the ugly scenes, there are sudden chains of thunders in clear blue sky, pouring rain at a blink, and peaking of gravitation that squashes everything near by. I think, in this manner, keiichi has no chance to even think of cheating Belldandy without considering death.

In third episode, Belldandy is scary in another way. Do you know hasegawa Sora? She is the only female member of the auto club who is always shy and blushing to a plain joke. Although she is a member of auto club, she is a speed-phobic. And, the problem is auto club seniors made entry to a car race by her name without her knowing it. Surely, hasegawa claims tens of times that she just can never do it. So, what can be possible, if the driver simply doesn't want to drive? Here the dreadful characteristic of Belldandy comes to play. I mean positively. Belldandy with smile suggests that she and hasegawa may have a training together at the temple to overcome the speed-phobic. In spite of almost hysteric support of both urd and Skuld, Hasegawa still cannot overcome her fear. People are kind of gave up, except Belldandy. Belldandy again with smile suggested to do it once more. Finally, when the racing day comes, and Hasegawa is so anxious about the race that she pretends to be sick. She cries and almost collapses, but again smiling Belldandy does not give up. The scary part is the way that Belldandy treats people with true and endless goodwill. Whatever it takes, she simply does not stop to see the positive side of things. Isn't it scary that somebody always believes you with full heart without any doubt or tiring?

The last episode, the sweattreat of the volume, is situated in a beach. For gutless keiichi, Megumi prescribed a fail-proof operation that guarantees the advance of Belldandy and keiichi's relationship. Alone together at the beach. Ok, that was the original plan. The problem is, you know, it is impossible to split three goddess musketeers. So, four of them, Keiichi, Belldandy, urd, and Skuld went to the beach. Mood is all set and indeed it's very good though. Belldandy in swimsuit, they are in the same room, and she even ask him to join her in outside bath, which is embarrassingly enough, coed. Plus, according to Urd and her explanation of astronology and horoscope, if he confesses his love tonight at a certain place, those two are bound together forever. I hope that you can remember the episode 2 of volume 1 where Belldandy actually explained certain kinds of things like destiny and heavenly forces that brought her to Keiichi. Anyway, he believes it, and brings Belldandy to that specific place. Of course, Skuld never let Keiichi advance with Belldandy. So, she literally emerges like a rocket canister from the water between Belldandy and Keiichi who is about to confess. The result is, Keiichi accidentally confesses to Skuld, not Belldandy. And, this puts both keiichi and Skuld in panic who believe in Urd's telling of destiny.

I think that this volume enriches and deepens personality of Belldandy very much. During the past episodes, she was naive and innocent but it was not this obvious that she has such a strong gut in some ways. This makes her character to be very unique. It is easy to create a character that is simply nave, innocent, and kind. But, it is really a something to create a character who are still innocent butt simultaneously insisting and smartly funny.",1153526400,,5687,4.8018386108273745
8098561,4,B000CEV3QO,"I have fallen in love with this series since I first saw it, I am almost (actually I am) obbsessed (I just know I spelled that wrong). But I am obbsessed enough to say that it is about time that something big happened again! I mean the 1st big thing was Belldandy showing up, the 2nd was Urd, 3rd (Skuld or Mara, I can't remember which one was before the other) and then this. I mean that it is a build up kind of thing. If you are any fan of the series this is for you, if you are new to the series, this is for you (except that you might want to see the earlier ones before this to get a background idea) and if you have never seen the series before, this will make you a fan in no time. If you are a fan of the Oh, My Goddess, but haven't seen this (or have been let down) this is something to see. So far it is true. I don't suggest renting this however, you need to buy it as soon as you see it. All the old fan's of the series should get the idea of the big thing from the title of this review.",1148256000,,1000,3.7666666666666666
8098562,5,B000CEV3QO,I have followed this series since the OVA and I really like how the new series expand on the original series and fills in the gaps nicely. There may be a few liberties but it is all worth it. I hope the series goes past the 24 episodes already made. Maybe they will remake the Mini Goddess series as well!!!,1144800000,,307,4.133333333333334
8098563,5,B000CEV3QO,"While the series remain faithful, but not accurate, based on the manga series, AMG finally picks up the pace in which we can finally see what adventures unveil at the Morisato household.
While the story started at a snail's pace it finally fast-forward towards the interesting stuff where Keichi and Bell finally get some time together, but as usual her sisters [...]in to make Keichi more embarrased at the end. However, more interesting events happen in the next volume...oops! I said too much...
But, this is the point in the series where you either love or despise Keichi and his difficulty to 'fess up his feelings towards Belldandy, I mean come on, even the Banpei-kun robot has more chances to get Bell. Time will tell i guess.
The dvd itself has a nice artwork of Keichi and Belldandy getting comfy with him, is that a nice artwork or what?, also you get a textless ending of the series with the song ""WING"" playing in the background, but it disappoints me to discover that the DVD has only 4 episodes, leaving out Ep 19 (the good one!), with 24 episodes that this series has, I have concluded that 6 episodes will come in the next volume, (not to mention the misterious ep. 12.5)...but then again, I could be wrong. I will cross my fingers and hope for the best. But for fans of this series I highly recommend it, this is a feel-good series that leaves you wanting more and a story that foreshadows its own ending without giving away none of the vital parts that make this series a must-see for everyone (over 13!) pick it off the shelf or order it now and see what you've been missing! Trust me you won't regret it!",1143849600,,1625,4.511864406779661
8098564,5,B000CEV3QO,"The challenges for our awkward couple continue as Mara and Megumi have an all too close encounter; one of Skulds inventions ends up being a little too good; and Keeichi gets a golden opportunity, if he can just separate the sisters for an hour. While things continue to progress slowly (understatement), the storys great warmth and good humor more than compensate. It is a pleasure to look in on these lovable characters, even when Keeichi just frustrates the heck out of you.

I have tried out some anime in the past and have been unimpressed, but not with this one. I've got the whole series, and I can't wait for the next installment",1143849600,,636,4.628318584070796
8098565,5,B000CEV3QO,"With this set of episodes the series starts to shine again.

Volume 4, like volume 3, has four episodes rather then five.  That's okay.  There are a lot of the typical plots that you would expect in this type of anime.  Yet these episode depend less on slapstick humor and more on character.  Keiichi is less of a klutz, a little surer of himself.

In episode 15 we are introduced to Banpai, a robot built by Skuld to help Belldandy around the temple and to protect Belldandy from harm.  Naturally Banpai falls in love with Belldandy and tries to protect her from Keiichi.

In episode 16 Mara, the evil demon, calls up a bad luck demon.  The two try to use bad luck on Keiichi and make Belldandy angry with him.  Mara also possesses Megumi, Keiichi's sister, also in an effort to interfere with the two heroes.

 In episode 17 Keiichi shows more of his caring side.  He and the goddesses try to help Hasegawa, a fellow Motor Club member, overcome her fears and race a go cart.

In episode 18 The goddesses and Keiichi vacation at the seashore.  Keiichi believes he has to kiss Belldandy under the moonlight if they are to stay together forever.  Urd is trying to help the two get together, and Skuld is trying to split them apart.

There's some computer generated animation in the seashore episode.  Even though it's identifiable as CGI it's subtle, and lends the scenes some depth.

This is a fun series.  The characters don't embarrass the viewer by behaving stupidly.  All in all it leaves you with a good feeling.",1143590400,10,1517,4.544444444444444
