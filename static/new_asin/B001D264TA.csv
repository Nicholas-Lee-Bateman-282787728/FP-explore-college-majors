8291508,5,B001D264TA,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. The music really has a great feel to it, and the quality and movement of the camera really sets the mood. I instantly fell in love with the owner of the car and decided that she was easily my dream girl. I thought the ending was very interesting, and I enjoyed seeing the progression of the trip as a whole. I would recommend this movie to everyone. excellent film!",1230681600,,402,4.445945945945946
8291509,4,B001D264TA,"2007's under the radar independent film The Go-Getter tells the story of a somewhat feeble and mundane Mercer(Lou taylor Pucci) who's decided to take a road trip in order to find his brother and convince him to help spread their deceased mother's ashes. With almost nothing to his name, Mercer steals a car; that is owned by the lovely Kate(Zooey Deschanel) and begins trekking across the U.S., finding loophole after loophole.

Yes, it is similar to the typical plot of an independent film, about a coming of age experience but it is more enjoyable then most, and the acting by the young cast is enjoyable. Not to mention some of the crazy characters we come to meet and quickly find a distaste for.

The cinematography is brilliant, all the scenery was just near flawless; with gorgeous colors and whimsical feelings.

Although the film itself is fantastic, the true star is the soundtrack, mostly by M Ward, it is surreal, calming and the perfect companion to the enjoyable movie.",1221436800,9,983,4.839285714285714
8291510,4,B001D264TA,"Synopsis: `The Go Getter' ('07) is an intriguing though at times uneven '07 film about one young man's transition into manhood during a journey across the cultural and geographical landscape of the Pacific coastline. Nineteen year old Mercer (Lou Taylor Pucci) goes ""walkabout"" (driveabout would probably be a more accurate term) in search of his older, long absent half-brother Arlen. The reason for this trip is to inform Arlen of their Mother's death, his method of transportation a stolen vehicle from the local carwash.  As Mercer works his way from place to place tracking his good-for-nothing sibling he begins a relationship with Kate (Zooey Deschanel) the owner of the vehicle via her cell phone left in the car.

Along the way the grieving, inexperienced road warrior interacts with a variety of memorable and not-so-memorable characters along the way; a community of pot smoking, pottery making, self-proclaimed Buddhists, four parolees posing as a band to entertain shut-ins as a part of their community service, a pill popping, sexually active ex-classmate from grammar school (Jena Malone) to name a few. As Mercer's feelings of alienation and loneliness mount the only solace available to him is the disembodied voice on the phone. Will our young wanderer find what he's seeking somewhere on the far horizon, or is it much closer than he could have ever imagined?

Critique: `The Go Getter' is yet another contemporary Indie film that deserves to be seen. In a similar vein of the American novelist, poet and artist Jack Kerouac, director and writer Martin Hynes provides the audience with a slice of life as found in the most unlikely of places. The images and dialogue flow in almost stream of consciousness fashion, hence the phase, ""the American River"". In my opinion the most enjoyable and poignant sequences deal with the evolving relationship between Mercer and Kate, truly the heart and soul of the tale.  Well worth a viewing or two.",1221436800,4,1957,5.087227414330218
