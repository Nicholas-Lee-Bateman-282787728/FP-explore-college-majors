8537231,3,B00979KQB8,"The Bible was a little better than DVD quality and the same for The Robe, a little better than DVD quality.

The missing quality was not so noticeable in the move The Bible because there was not much in the way of small details on screen.  On the other hand, in the movie The Robe, there are many small objects on the screen, such as fine detail in metal ornaments in the senator's home, on the tribune or jewelry for example.

The packaging was also sub-par, very thin and cheap feeling.

The movies played without issue and that is the best I can say about this set.",1492560000,2,568,4.280373831775701
