8677157,5,B00NBBR33C,One of the best martial arts movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Amazing choreography as well as amazing comedy. This is one to watch.,1520985600,,143,4.538461538461538
8677158,4,B00NBBR33C,"Pretty good little flick with nice production values and excellent fight scenes. Hiroyuki Sanada acquits himself very well in the fight and acrobatic scenes and is one of the few fighters who looks to hold his own against my boy Hwang Jang Lee who just sort of shows up out of nowhere at the end. Silly overall but a lot of fun, one of those movies I remember as a kid that still hold up well. Plus this movie has one of the stupidest and funniest ""HJL lay down and die"" endings ever.",1511568000,,484,4.21505376344086

8677166,5,B00NBBR33C,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It has all of the elements of a classic Hong Kong martial arts film, action, comedy, and drama!  The fight between Conan and Sanada was aerobatic and fantastically complicated, as was the final fight scene in the film.",1434326400,,251,4.813953488372093
