8119341,5,B000F9RL6W,"I loved seeing this film again. My name is Junifer Tate Smith and I worked on the making of this film in the summer of 1968. We premiered it at
Expo ""69 in New York. It brought back the summer of my youth and I was able to recapture the wonder of discovery on the threshold between childhood and adulthood. Even though I was only seventeen at the time,  I was struck by the attention to detail and expertise  of J. D.'s directing and filming techniques. He knew what he wanted and took whatever steps necessary to achieve his vision, whether it was building a set or building a mechanism for shooting a scene. What J. D. accomplished with the final product was to flesh out and give substance to a previously unfinished slice of Civil War prose. Even today, I remain impressed. .",1501113600,,779,4.402777777777778
8119342,4,B000F9RL6W,You'd have to be a fan of Gordon Baxter's writing to really enjoy this to the max. He does a nice job as an actor with a character that is mostly well directed. Additions to the original Ambrose Bierce story make it a bit overwrought in places. The extra DVD features about the remastering of the original film and critical comments are very interesting.,1455580800,,354,4.546875
8119343,3,B000F9RL6W,"I enjoyed the film, but it is very dated, the music and camera work scream 1970S!!!!
The nice thing about a period piece is you can avoid a ""dated"" look, but the director chose to make a more contemporary film.
Too bad, the best works of art are timeless, sadly this isn't.

I'm a fan of Gordon Baxter's writings, I was disappointed we don't get to hear him much...",1388620800,,365,4.2898550724637685
8119344,4,B000F9RL6W,"I had seen this when it was first shown. I wanted to watch it again because when my children were young we had canoes along Village Creek near Silsbee, Tx, where this film was actually shot. I thought it was a good movie because of the suspense and because of the ending. I thought Gordon Baxter did an excellent job in his role",1311206400,,328,4.222222222222222
8119345,5,B000F9RL6W,I was so glad to see this offered for sale. I have been searching for this movie for years. Service for purchase was very good. Thanks,1211155200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8119346,1,B000F9RL6W,"As a writer planning to adapt some Bierce stories for film, I was curious about how this one was done. Most films are products of their time, and this one screams 'dated.' The music is horrible but typical TV show over the top stuff, and the uniforms are atrocious since the '70s were not known for their authenticity to detail in anything historical!

Mainly, the story is dulled by changing Bierce's ending,(I won't spoil it) and adding a silly storyline that tries to create backstory on the main character but instead just slows everything down into too many flashbacks.

I understand Tony Scott did a version, but I cannot find a way to get a copy. It can only be a 100% improvement over this sorry effort.",1197849600,,711,4.590551181102362
8119347,4,B000F9RL6W,Based on a little known story by Ambrose Bierce (a name Civil War fanatics will recognize) the film is interesting with a twist at the end that causes one to ponder the helplessness of man and the power of fear.,1175644800,,211,4.3
