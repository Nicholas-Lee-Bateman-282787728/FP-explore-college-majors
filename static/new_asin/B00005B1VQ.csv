1419496,5,B00005B1VQ,"This is a showcase of great acting.  Right down the line.  It is the best work I've ever seen from Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas.  Even Jeremy Irons reaches peaks I've never seen from him before.  The story is linear, following several generations of the same family and showing the aging of the most important characters.  Novels handle this kind of thing best, but House of the Spirits does an admirable job with it  Meryl Streep gives another of her astounding performances, in difficult material.  We also have here beautiful cinematography and spot-on directing.  More about Irons:  he proves himself an excellent horseman, as well as a fine actor; and despite his beautiful voice, he never croons or indulges himself.  He shows fierce concentration and uses his entire body in conveying character.  And I have to say, he is given some gorgeous clothing to wear and his natural grace only enhances its effect.",1475884800,,918,4.934640522875817

1419510,3,B00005B1VQ,"One of those movies where great acting cannot make up for not-so-great story telling. Perhaps this is one of those movies you need to read the book first to fully understand (I did not). Glenn Close and Meryl Streeps' rolls could have been reversed as Meryl appears much older than Glenn.
The movie starts out with what seems to be a focus on young Clara's clairvoyancy, which is where I thought the movie was heading. It wasn't and didn't play much of a part in the rest of the film. The movie could have been cut by 45 minutes and not have lost a thing.
Not terrible - but too long and confusing at times - many of the characters (the illegitimate son and the grandaughter's lover) look so much alike you can get them mixed up. All acting was very good except Winona Ryder - not her best work.",1456099200,,795,4.306666666666667

1419535,1,B00005B1VQ,"Sigh. I mean, really, sigh. A brilliant cast, beautiful settings and cinematography-- too bad they left out the story. It's called ""House of the Spirits"", but why? There are no spirits. Clara has clairvoyance and can move objects with her mind, but these abilities are mostly irrelevant to the movie. It doesn't explain how to reconcile her clairvoyance with falling in love with Esteban, who is a greedy murderous sadist. She even tells their daughter Blanca that he doesn't commit evil deeds like rape, philandering, owning slaves, neglecting his mother, abusing his sister, and overthrowing the goverment out of malice, no, he's just had a hard life.

I guess Esteban is supposed to find some kind of redemption at the end, after his coup backfires on him. Poor man, the military confiscates his car and scorns him. So much suffering. Meanwhile his daugher Blanca is arrested and raped and tortured, thanks to dear old Dad's coup, and I guess there is supposed to be something significant in her captor being her illegitimate half-brother whose mother was raped by Esteban, and whose military career was funded by Esteban. By gosh that teaches old Esteban a lesson.

The movie ends with Blanca miraculously recovered and reading her mother's journals, which are supposed to make sense of the whole sorry mess.

Glenn Close is wonderful as Ferula, Antonio Banderas is handsome and heroic as Pedro, and Winona Ryder does as much as can be done with a limited thankless role as Blanca. Meryl Streep as Clara made no sense to me at all; she's supposed to be all ethereal and saintly, but WTF is she doing married to the odious and evil Esteban? She happily reaps the fruits of his greed and cruelty, lives a luxurious privileged life built on the backs of slaves, and then dies before things turn ugly, so she never has to face any consequences. The movie makes it Esteban's story. Yep he's a great guy, except for a few little character flaws.

And what's the deal with Clara's parents being killed when their car is hit by a train? There is a big boom, flames and explosion, and then nobody says a word. You'd think that sooner or later someone would notice.

Stupid movie. I wish I could give it no stars.",1429142400,,2207,4.736979166666667

1419537,4,B00005B1VQ,"It was a great film when it came out. The acting is still absolutely astonishing and admirable and yet there is something that is missing twenty-two years later.

The film is so centered on the main character, Esteban Trueba, and his family, or rather his personal history in Chile, his economic fight to raise himself by his own effort over his lot, to become one of the most economically powerful, and later one of the most politically powerful men that we do not really capture the country itself. What is shown of the working class movement is just really anecdotic. Too close to the tragedy in 1993 the film does not show Allende's party, which was not the Communist Party of Chile, using Lenin and Stalin as direct political references. Their approach was tremendously sectarian and that explains this, and vice versa. They only won the election with slightly more than one third of the votes which was not enough and the enthusiasm of the beginning wore out rather fast.

The film is silent about the real conspiracy with the support of the USA and with the deranged support of the Conservatives who did not even understood what they were doing, at least that's what the film shows though I am sure it was not that simple: these politicians supported the putsch and for a long time then Pinochet himself. The film is silent on the length of his reign, on the difficulty the country faced later on when he was to be removed, etc. It is nearly a miracle that some democratic order could be re-established in this country. It is true 1993 was too close: the distance was not enough to be able to really get into some detail about the contradictory situation the victory of El Pueblo Unido brought into Chile with Allende first and then Pinochet.

The film is silent too on the fact the US embassy was not the refuge for escaping revolutionaries because the USA were on Pinochet's side all along. Canada was the only viable option indeed. So twenty-two years after the film and forty-two years after the putsch the film is rather nothing but a denunciation of harsh working conditions for the working class, of military arrogance and violence when ""service men"" meddle with politics, the full inhumanity of the politicians who accepted the adventure of a military coup, and the purely family-oriented empathy of Esteban Trueba at the end of the film.

The fact that Blanca was questioned during her detention by her half brother was sentimentalese and such a connection between the torturer and the tortured person was a fair guarantee that the questioning would fail because on the torturer's side there was a desire for revenge, hence the use of pure violence for the sake of violence, and on the side of the tortured person, Blanca, there was a strong feeling of resistance, hatred, desire to fail that intruder, that out of wedlock competitor, challenger, dominator. There should never be any relation of that sort between the two sides of a questioning session of that type, i.e. under duress.

So the only thing we have at the end is that decision of Blanca's to wash away any desire of revenge or vengeance, but we know that in 1993 that could not be true and even today it sounds very difficult. We have very few examples of that nature and South Africa does not really qualify because in that case the dictatorial power (the apartheid government) just passed that power to their opposition whose leader they liberated from prison on the occasion. For that feeling to be believable you need distance and a tremendous political change that can bring reconciliation. But the real objective was and still is justice in such cases.

The film then has strong scenes and moments but altogether it has become too sentimental and politically superficial to be believable.

1419551,1,B00005B1VQ,"This film, admittedly, features a stellar cast who, in anything else, are consistently fantastic. This film, which is based loosely, and I mean LOOSELY, based on Isabel Allende's absolutely fantastic novel, is a complete and utter waste of money. Not only do they take certain scenes in the book and take them completely out of context and place them in the completely wring generation, setting, and with the wrong characters, but they also picked the completely wrong cast to portray these beloved characters. Yes, it is a stellar combination of amazing actors who are fantastic actors in and of themselves, but they are completely wrong for these parts. You know a film is going to be bad when they take an almost entirely white, American and/or European cast and stick them in roles that, in the original novel, are from Chile, Latin American, and of Spanish and possibly Arabic descent. It simply doesn't work. This film is horrendous, and it hurts to say this because I absolutely adore the book. Honestly, House of the Spirits is just one of those books that should have been left as is, with no attempt to turn it onto a movie, which, by the way, was received horribly in places that weren't directly involved in the production and financing of the film, namely Germany and Denmark, and didn't even make back what it's budget was (in the US, it only made back a little over $6 million USD of it's $40 million budget).",1413936000,,1424,4.72289156626506

It was mildly unrealistic that all the characters of the South American Trueba/del Valle family were Caucasian, but that being said Meryl Streep's acting was amazing as usual. A few of the story lines of the book were cut out, which I as not surprised about since it needed to be condensed into a 2-hour film.

1419559,1,B00005B1VQ,"This was my first experience with Amazon and it was a total disaster as well as the ultimate in bad customer experience.  I ordered a dvd and received what seemed to be a bootleg copy.  It would not play & I explained in detail what was the conflict when I made the first return.  Unfortunatley I chose to have the item replaced &^ was sent the same exact thing.  It had a message on the screen that it could not be viewed in my area.  I do not understand why the item was not checked to ensure that I was not given another faulty dvd.  I had the worst time ever dealing with your company.  Not only a great deal of disappointment and frustration was involved, but time was wasted trying to give you the opportunity to make it right.  This was a gift and needless to say that I was totally embarrassed to not be able to give the requested gift.  Thank goodness I took the time to check out the product in the first place or it would have been more embarrassing to have given a defected gift.  I ended up getting the movie from a reliable source.
I sincerely doubt that I will EVER take a chance with ordering anything else from you.  Never again do I even care to subject myself to such poor customer service and unauthentic products.  And what makes it worse is to realize that you are charging a premium price for a bootleg copy of a movie.  If I were vindictive then I would report such abuse.  But you obviously have to deal with enough when all of the unsatisfied customers complain and return the illegal merchandise.
It is a shame that you offer so many great things and I just happened to order the one thing that is illegal.
Like I said.... this experience has left me with an extremely poor opinion about your company.  If only the item had been tested to ensure that I would not get the same thing with the same issue, then I am sure I would not feel this way.  It seems as though I just wasted a great deal of my time to even bother to explain why I was returning the first one.  In my opinion, this is not a professional way to treat even a small sale such as mine.

1419573,3,B00005B1VQ,"This drama follows a family through several decades beginning in 1926 in La Dehesa, South America. During these decades the family goes through many changes and conflicts and so does the country. Due to the status of the family the changes and conflicts in the family and in the country effect each other. The plot covers social status, social climbing, social conflict, and social oppression, as will as political changes and conflicts. Mixed in with all of this, one of the main characters is clairvoyant. This plays into the plot but is not really a major contributor to the direction of the plot. She does, however, make a few predictions,  her and two people with her see someone who is dead, and after her death she makes two ghostly visits to other members of the family.
I found the first half of the movie somewhat mediocre, but the second half picked up to fair as both the family and political conflicts build.
The movie contains one rape scene, it is not explicit in a truly sexual way as the two people are only seen from the shoulder up during sex, but the woman's breasts are seen when her blouse is ripped open. Later a prostitute is seen nude, but only her breasts are seen from the front, she is seen fully from the rear. A man is later seen nude from the rear through a thin curtain while having sex with his wife. A couple in their late teens are seen nude have sex on the ground by the river, they are seen fully only from a distance. There is also one torture sequence which includes sexual torture, but does not include nudity.
There is also one non-sexual nude scene when a boy and girl around the age of six are skinny dipping together.  Both children are seen fully both from the front and the rear, but mostly from some distance. The girl is briefly seen from the front somewhat closer.",1393372800,,1813,4.474320241691843

In fact I've re-read it several times)... The movie doesn't resemble the novel in a way, except the names of the characters. It barely makes sense in anyway what so ever about the story portrayed on the book. The movie moves from scene to scene without any logic, it has two different eras in the same picture (how is it possible that Clara is representing 19th century and her daughter Blanca is dressed as a 21th century teenager?) With the remarkable cast that is reunited this is supposed to be a masterpiece...but instead is a mockery of a great novel.

1419580,4,B00005B1VQ,"This was a brilliant film in the same genre as Like Water for Chocolate,  Love in the Time of Cholera, and In the Time of the Butterflies.  I love films set in exotic locations, and sometimes feel that the US is unaware of Latin America and its vibrant culture.  The casting was not quite to my taste as Glenn Close (too masculine) and Meryl Streep (too mannered and pretentious) are just about my least favorite actresses and Jeremey Irons is always suffering from self inflicted torture.  I also thought that the actor who played the illegitimate son and  Antonio Banderas should have  switched roles, yet despite my personal preferences, everything in the film rose above them and I just loved it.  They also captured the whimisical quality of the book in which the departed are still with us as spirits.  The photography was superb, a feast for the eyes, and Hans Zimmer's score never intruded.  I have long awaited this film released on DVD.

So why did I only  give it four stars?  The DVD by  Miramax and Echo Park did not have either captions or subtitles, and being seriously hearing impaired i.e 70%  deaf, I rely on the captions.

1419586,4,B00005B1VQ,"I didn't read the novel so I'm not comparing the two and I have scant knowledge of the actual events in Chile at the time this film describes so I have no comment about its historical accuracy. So I'm just judging this simply as a ""movie.""

I liked the story a lot and the scope of generations, the ups and downs of the characters, and the social and political issues involved.  It's indeed a rich tale and I can imagine how wonderful the novel must be.  For all of the supposed passion in the story, though, I found it curiously unmoving.  I am a big crybaby and have been known to bawl through films while others remain dry-eyed. So I was at a loss for an explanation of why this film failed to move me.  Perhaps it was the casting?  I loved Meryl Streep as the highly sensitive, loving Clara and if anyone did evoke any emotion at all in me, it was Meryl.  Glen Close did a fine job as her unhappy sister-in-law but somehow, even at her death bed, I wasn't much moved.  Perhaps it was the director?  I've never been a fan of Jeremy Irons and although I thought he, too, did a good job, I couldn't muster a lot of feeling for him.  I thought Winona Ryder was horribly miscast---she looked, moved and spoke like a girl who belonged at home in an American shopping mall rather than  at a plantation in South America in the last century,  Anotonio Banderas, a handsome and charming fellow, just wasn't convincing to me as a revolutionary.  Vanessa Redgrave was lovely in her small role and several of the native characters were convincing, notably Esteban, the bastard son of the Irons character.

The cinematography is lovely and the whole film is nice to look at.  Again, given the story, the cast and the beauty of the land, it is not clear to me why it failed to produce a more vivid effect.  It could have been an epic but it didn't quite reach that level.  Still if you don't expect too much it's worth watching.",1375142400,,1917,4.354929577464789

We watched this so-called 'substandard' DVD and enjoyed the film more than before.

Why would Pedro (and they pronounce the name with heavy American accent even though all the characters were supposed to be Chileans!) hide in a basement while his lover was suffering in the prison for him? It doesn't make any sense. The reconciliation scene between Esteban and Pedro was just weird and completely out of character.

The movie just butchered the book into pieces. If it's only ""loosely"" based on the book, why even use the same name? I wonder what Allende thinks about this horrendous rendition of her masterpiece.

1419669,4,B00005B1VQ,"From the touching  inspiration of Isabel Allende, this feminine perspective deals about the profound emotional conflicts inside a wealthy family. The film makes a smart narrative ellipsis through threwe generations along seventy years, and shows us those first insights of a little child by then, who is gifted of premonitory visions, who falls in love with the boyfriend of her sister. She foresees an imminent tragedy and lives with this terrible sense of guilt by not having been able to avoid it.

But, through the years, this young boy will become a true wealthy man and love will make the rest. But meanwhile, there's a lot of brilliant secondary plots that enrich the historical vision with absorbing engagement.

Once more, Jeremy Irons and Merrill Streep reencountered again and both head with admirable realism to convey those unsaid feelings. But besides, the film shows us the social environment, its inner contradictions, the conflict of power between this self-exigent man and his sister Ferula (Glenn Close) and the unstoppable love affair (a veiled homage to Romeo and Juliet) among his own daughter (Winona Ryder with her dazzling beauty) and the son of a very humble worker of his farm (Antonio Banderas).

If you ever visit Chile, please see this movie and you'll understand part of the Chilean character and history: under our modern facade, there's still Biancas, Pedros and Truebas.

1419672,5,B00005B1VQ,"I love this movie! It has a stellar cast, who give top notch performances. How can you go wrong with Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Antonio Banderas, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave, and Armin Muehler-Stahl? The answer is that you can't. It is a riveting piece of film making, based loosely upon Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name.

The film delicately captures the mysticism of the book, rendering those scenes in which such is the focal point highly believable. This is no mean feat given the subject matter. The story takes place in South America. The saga begins in the nineteen thirties.

Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Muehler-Stahl play the wealthy and liberal parents of two daughters, Rosa and Clara Del Valle. Rosa is the beautiful, older daughter. Clara, played by Meryl Streep's real life daughter, is a lovely child with exceptional, psychic gifts. Jeremy Irons plays the part of Esteban Trueba, an impoverished young man in love with Rosa. Vowing to make his fortune in order to marry her and provide her with the comforts to which she is accustomed, he succeeds in making his fortune. He loses Rosa, however, before being able to marry her, when she drinks poisoned wine intended for her liberal party father.

Esteban, broken hearted, leaves with his fortune and buys an estancia, where he sternly rules with an iron fist over the peasants who work the land for him. They obsequiously refer to him as ""Patron"". He takes what he wants, even the women, with the expected result. He has a bastard son whom he does not acknowledge.

Esteban has a spinster sister, Ferla, well acted by Glenn Close, who, for the past twenty years, has lived a grim existence in the city with their ailing mother, whom she has taken care of. When their mother dies, Esteban, now a bitter and lonely man, returns to the city from his estancia to attend his mother's funeral. In doing so, he spots Clara, who is now all grown up and ethereally portrayed by the very talented Meryl Streep. Not wasting a moment, he goes to her home. She, luminous and mystical, already knows that he is there to ask for her hand in marriage and happily accepts. After all, she has loved him ever since she first saw him all those years ago.

Clara lovingly embraces his sister, Ferla, into the bosom of her househould, when they move to her Esteban's estancia. Ferla blossoms from a bitter old maid into a companionable and pleasant woman, under Clara's warmth. Esteban and Clara eventually have a child, Blanca, who grows up playing with Pedro, the son of the estancia's indigenous indian foreperson. When Esteban discovers this, he sends Blanca away to boarding school. He does not want his daughter fraternizing with the peasants.

1419673,5,B00005B1VQ,"I love this movie! It has a stellar cast, who give top notch performances. How can you go wrong with Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Antonio Banderas, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave, and Armin Muehler-Stahl? The answer is that you can't. It is a riveting piece of film making, based loosely upon Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name.

The film delicately captures the mysticism of the book, rendering those scenes in which such is the focal point highly believable. This is no mean feat given the subject matter. The story takes place in South America. The saga begins in the nineteen thirties.

Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Muehler-Stahl play the wealthy and liberal parents of two daughters, Rosa and Clara Del Valle. Rosa is the beautiful, older daughter. Clara, played by Meryl Streep's real life daughter, is a lovely child with exceptional, psychic gifts. Jeremy Irons plays the part of Esteban Trueba, an impoverished young man in love with Rosa. Vowing to make his fortune in order to marry her and provide her with the comforts to which she is accustomed, he succeeds in making his fortune. He loses Rosa, however, before being able to marry her, when she drinks poisoned wine intended for her liberal party father.

Esteban, broken hearted, leaves with his fortune and buys an estancia, where he sternly rules with an iron fist over the peasants who work the land for him. They obsequiously refer to him as ""Patron"". He takes what he wants, even the women, with the expected result. He has a bastard son whom he does not acknowledge.

Esteban has a spinster sister, Ferla, well acted by Glenn Close, who, for the past twenty years, has lived a grim existence in the city with their ailing mother, whom she has taken care of. When their mother dies, Esteban, now a bitter and lonely man, returns to the city from his estancia to attend his mother's funeral. In doing so, he spots Clara, who is now all grown up and ethereally portrayed by the very talented Meryl Streep. Not wasting a moment, he goes to her home. She, luminous, and mystical, already knows that he is there to ask for her hand in marriage and happily accepts. After all, she has loved him ever since she first saw him all those years ago.

Clara lovingly embraces his sister, Ferla, into the bosom of her househould, when they move to her Esteban's estancia. Ferla blossoms from a bitter old maid into a companionable and pleasant woman, under Clara's warmth. Esteban and Clara eventually have a child, Blanca, who grows up playing with Pedro, the son of the estancia's indigenous indian foreperson. When Esteban discovers this, he sends Blanca away to boarding school. He does not want his daughter fraternizing with the peasants.

Clara, loving and pure of heart, is his exact opposite. When their daughter finally grows up and returns home from school, she knows that the independent Blanca, well played by Winona Ryder, has fallen in love with her childhood playmate, Pedro, passionately portrayed by Antonio Banderas.

The cast is famous and their acting is okay, but the dialogue is not good at all. I feel robbed for renting this DVD, it was a real disapointment. I think I could've done a better job at providing the audience with an enjoyable film that develops all important aspects of the story than Bille August.

About 400 pages worth is squashed into the film's lean 140 minutes, but it doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing.
The book had relied on first person narrative, which lent the sweeping generational and political tumults in a South American country the right touch of personal fervour, and more importantly, a consistent point of view.
The film on the other hand falters on this facet, a deficiency that robs the film of its conviction, its soul. The director seemed to have assumed that the pithy story would be enough to keep the audience interested, but it is not. About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I found myself counting minutes.
The terrific cast is what ultimately salvages the movie. Meryl Streep in particular is perfect in her depiction of the ethereal, psychic wife of a powerful plantation owner. Jeremy Irons, as her jealous and ruthless husband, has some fantastic moments too but hams it up somewhat when he plays himself as an old man. Yet his torn emotional battle between his family and his political ambitions is so well brought out that one actually relates to his quandary.
All in all, although the film waylays something pivotal along the way and of course skimps on being a loyal adaptation, it is surely a lot better than its average rating on Amazon would suggest. Definitely a recommended rental.",1089763200,,1510,4.879377431906615
1419681,5,B00005B1VQ,"...that it's adapted from a novel.  Since I haven't read the novel, I have nothing to compare it against but even then it's obvious that a lot has had to be omitted in order to make it into a film.
Overall, it's a riveting film, though parts of it were fairly predictable---mainly the circular tragedy and poetic/ironic justice parts, and of course the South American socioeconomic/political history is very familiar.  Not until reading the production notes on the DVD did I know for certain that the movie is set in Chile, but that was my first guess immediately---though it is curious that the film barely mentions in passing, the vital role of our C.I.A. in setting up the military coup which overthrew the democratically elected government and installed the hideously repressive and genocidal Pinochet regime.
The ending, with Winona Ryder opining on the preciousness of life's every moment and the power of love and forgiveness, basically pops up out of nowhere but I'm sure that these themes are much better developed in the novel.
There are far worse ways to spend 2 hours; with this film, despite its subtle flaws, at least we get a little bit of modern South American history and society, even if the dirty little secrets of our C.I.A. involvement in it are just barely hinted at.  In many ways it is not only a good eye-opener about social and political injustice and brutality, but also carries something of a feminist edge---showing the reckless and self-absorbed megalomania and egotism of the ambitious men who claw their way into the ruling class and then proceed to keep everyone else around them down and under their thumbs.",1083196800,,1641,4.874551971326165

In the longer version,  the Jeremy Irons character at the beginning of the film is in his old age.  He visits his old farmhouse with his daughter and remembers the years gone past.  The movie then goes into a flashback and tells the story from his youth.
In the DVD version, the entire opening scene is omitted and the story is told from the beginning.  Therefore there is NO suggestion of a flashback.  The edited out opening scene is quite poignant and gives more insight into the Jeremy Irons character.

The history is deep and the hardships of this family, although very well off and influential, heartfelt.  It puts one in awe at how even people who have so much power at one point can loose it all in an instant, as well as to never treat those beneath you unfairly because of your power, wealth, or position.

Meryl Streep is cast as Clara, a woman with the gift of clairvoyance who grows up to marry Esteban played by Jeremy Irons.  He's become a wealthy landholder who treats his workers badly and takes advantage of the women. Winona Ryder is their daughter who falls in love with Antonio Banderas, a young revolutionary, and Glen Close is Esteban's spinster sister.  That's quite a cast.  And they all do excellent jobs.
The story engaged me and kept me watching.  It was interesting to see how the characters developed and how the country changed.  There are many moments of high drama and conflict but my emotions were never stirred and it all played out like one long soap opera.

1419691,5,B00005B1VQ,"""The House of the Spirits"" was unknown to me until I read a review by my friend, ""lawyeraau"".  I can't thank her enough for introducing this movie to me.
  This is not the story of a house, but rather two... that takes place in South America...a beautiful country with an urgent desire to reform.  Here begins our 60 year long saga of three remarkable generations.
Esteban (Jeremy Irons) wants to marry the young bride Rosa, the beautiful daughter of the Del Valle family.  But an accidental tragedy takes the young girl's life and Esteban leaves, heart-broken to find his fortune on a large farm in the country side. Here he builds a beautiful house, hires ranch-hands, and becomes the infinitely wealthy ""Patron"".
  Esteban returns to the house his former beloved once lived, and to his surprise, he instantly falls in love with Rosa's younger and very clairvoyant sister, Clara (Meryl Streep). They marry and return to his wealthy farm, bringing along Esteban's sister Ferla (Glenn Close) who is a turmoiled woman who has never known affection in her life. Esteban treats her abusively and cares nothing for her.  Opposingly, Clara adores Ferla and they become closer than sisters. When I say closer, I can almost say there were moments of romantic love between Clara and Ferla.  Ferla, who is an old, black-wearing spinster finds herself obsessed with Clara...her beauty, her passion, and her life, and believes her unusual gift of seeing the future brings her closer to God.  All these things are denied in life to Ferla.

  Once Clara gives birth to her daughter Blanca, Esteban in his hateful manner decides Ferla is a threat to his family and dismisses her forever from their lives.
  Life goes on at the ranch without Ferla's over-zealous presence.  Evidence of Esteban having illegitimate children, and mistreating his ranch workers eventually causes too much trouble for him.  He begins to grow forever angry at heart..resenting the locals, often beating them into submission to work.  He treats, what he believes, the ""lower caste"" like animals and maintains a life-long disgust for them.
  How unfortunate for him that his daughter Blaca (Winona Ryder) falls for the most revolutionary man on the farm, Pedro (Antonio banderas).  Thier love, like her parent's began at childhood and they intend never to be seperated.
  Pedro is chased with gun far from the farm (having no idea that Blanca is pregnant with his child). An attempt to control the revolutionary ideas of ""The People"" and to keep him away from Blanca.  This is the beginning of futile wars to come in South America.  One with many horrifying twists and turns for the family.
  This movie is excellent in so many ways. The cast was nothing short of perfection.  There are enough hidden secrets, desires, politics, intrigue, war, torture, and affairs, to lend this movie enough dark corners to be explored, that it is impossible to even take notice of the length of the movie. It is long, but every chapter in this multi-generational film is as exciting as the first.  I honestly don't understand why this movie is so unknown. It has that ""classic"" vibe that screams out for the attention it deserves.  If you like this movie, you might also like a similar multi-generational movie...""Sunshine"", another beatiful movie not to be missed.",1016755200,,3311,4.945652173913044

Clara, loving and pure of heart, is his exact opposite. When their daughter finally grows up and returns home from school, she knows that the independent Blanca, well played by Winona Ryder, has fallen in love with her childhood playmate, Pedro, passionately portrayed by Antonio Banderas. Esteban hates Pedro, as Pedro is a liberal inciting the peasants to unionize and demand their rights, whipping them into a frenzy against the ""Patron"", or so Esteban sees it. He drives Pedro off his land. He also drives Ferla off, as he believes her to have unatural feelings for his wife, Clara. Possessive to a fault, he is consumed by jealousy. Clara and Esteban have a fight over his cruelties, and she finally leaves him, taking Blanca with her to the Del Valle family home in the city.
Meanwhile, life goes on. Blanca, pregnant by Pedro, has his child, believing that Pedro has been killed by her father. Esteban, representing the wealthy, becomes senator. He reigns for years, until the liberals win power. When they do, however, their tenure is short lived, as a militairy coup sets up a reign of terror and his old sins come home to roost. Meanwhile, Blanca discovers that Pedro is alive, and they joyously hook up again. When Blanca is picked up as a political dissident and tortured for her political views, Esteban, old and broken, is now just a bit player in a larger arena. Too late, he tries to right some wrongs. Some of the wrongs, however, can never be righted.
This is a magnificent, multi-generational family epic, that holds the viewer in its thrall. While it only loosely follows Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name, it is a winner in its own right. It has something for everyone, as it deals with human nature, as well as the complex emotions, forces, and events that shape one. The film is about a family struggling to find its place in our ever changing world, and the relationships that each member of that family forges. It is a rich and vibrant tapestry, which succeeds in capturing the viewer.",1015632000,,4751,4.788063337393423

Only here do you find people who still give a platform to communists like Isabel Allende, the niece of the Communist ruler of Chile who was assassinated by Pinochet. Only in Hollywood could  Her Highness, the Queen of Cookoo, Vanessa Redgrave, get work. How anyone in their right mind, (and perhaps that's the point), could continue to prop up communism after witnessing the hundreds of millions of people who have been murdered, tortured, and starved by it's leaders, and after it has proven to be a dismal failure, disillusioning all but the most foolish of it's adherents, is absolutely beyond understanding.
I love how the ""enlightened"" conservative senator confesses in the end, ""How could I have been so wrong?"" How could Isabel Allende be so wrong, when after Pinochet took power the standard of living for the Chilean worker rose faster than any other Latin American country? Who delivered the goods for the working man? The communist Allende? Sorry, no. As brutal, and evil a dictator he was, deal with it my red friends, it was Pinochet.
Please understand, I am in no way endorsing his brutal thuggery, but I have to ask, don't you think it's ironic that it was Pinochet's economic policies that made all the dreams of the communist come true for the ""working man"" in Chile? For those of you who don't know, Pinochet hired a group of University of Chicago economists to form his economic policies which, after implemented, were so successful, that Chile's economic performance has since been known as the ""Chilean Miracle.""

1419694,2,B00005B1VQ,"""The House of the Spirits"" documents three generations of author Isabel Allende's fictional Trueba family, opening with an extended panorama of the Chilean countryside.  Narration begins with Winona Ryder speaking as her character Blanca, introducing us to the rich and prosperous del Valle family and more specifically to her clairvoyant mother Clara (Streep).

The magnitude of Clara's psychic abilities is revealed early on when she predicts the death of her elder sister Rosa (Polo).  Esteban Trueba (Irons), the man intended to marry her, drowns his pain in the backbreaking restoration of his dilapidated hacienda Tr&eacute;s Mariez, neither speaking with or seeing the del Valles over the next ten years.

He and his elder sister F&eacute;rula (Close) meet up with them again at the funeral of their mother, the family offering their condolences.  It is here that we see that Clara has grown up, a demure, beautiful and highly reticent young woman.  Upon seeing her for the first time in over a decade, Esteban is entranced and steps inside the del Valle home once more to ask for her hand.  She unabashedly accepts and they are married within days, settling into his now thriving property.

Once colonized into his position of power and wealth with his new bride, Esteban becomes an intimidating patriarch - possessive and callous.  Wanting to possess not only Clara's physical body but also her mystic psyche, he sees an obstacle in her affections for F&eacute;rula and banishes her from his property, threatening to kill her if she returns. His menservants receive equally disdainful treatment, their disobedience to their ""p&aacute;tron"" punishable by a severe lashing.  Esteban is especially conscious of Pedro Tercero (Banderas), a fiery radical who rouses the peasants' anger regarding their denied civil liberties.

The straw that breaks the camel's back is Blanca's out-of-wedlock pregnancy and the fact that Pedro is the father of her unborn child, the product of a love that has intensified since their childhood.  Pedro goes into hiding, Blanca gives birth to their daughter Alba and Esteban becomes a Senator for the Conservative party.  Shortly after the People's Party wins the election, Chile's political mayhem comes to a head and Esteban's years of bad karma come back at him full swing.

The film misrepresents a great deal of what Allende has written in her novel (""La Casa De Los Espir&iacute;tus"" in her native language) and the biggest mistake was allowing director Bille August to pen the screenplay.  People and events have been changed for convenience of the passage of time for which he and his producers could either not fulfill or didn't have the patience for.  If the story's history had been traced correctly, the film would certainly have exceeded a three-hour time length.  Instead of trying to keep a sense of purity to Allende's story, August has miserably chopped it in half by making the despicable Esteban Garc&iacute;a Trueba's son (instead of his grandson) and by having Blanca abducted and tortured by Chilean militants instead of her daughter Alba (which would've pushed the movie ahead another twenty years).  Blanca's twin brothers Jaime and Nicol&aacute;s are completely omitted, along with the mystic Mora Sisters, Amanda, Miguel and every one of Clara's numerous siblings aside from Rosa (Polo, who looks not the least bit maritime).

""The House of the Spirits"" presents a highly inaccurate portrayal of the relationship between F&eacute;rula and Esteban. In the book, they were persistently pitted against each other, each vying for Clara's affections.  F&eacute;rula is just as deviant as Esteban in her quest to win Clara's love but August choose to create an inclusive portrait of a helpless victim; he escalates Esteban's cruelty to an unreasonable level and as a result ruins the veritable nature of both characters, giving the audience more reason to despise Esteban and commiserate with F&eacute;rula.  He also fails to observe Blanca's enforced marriage to French Count Jean de Satigny and completely neglects Alba, Blanca's headstrong daughter.

All of the actors do an admirable job portraying their characters but with August's butchering of Allende's story and the wonderful character development that one is able to experience by reading her novel, a lot of personality and interest is lost in her three pivotal female characters (Clara, Blanca and Alba).  Next to how we come to know them by reading the novel, their personalities seem a bit flaccid and obscured on screen.  Winona Ryder adheres well to Blanca's aloof qualities but this is still a faulty casting choice. Although she is aesthetically pleasing, she lacks the emotional depth of her co-star and Streep pretty much drowns her out.  Even though I have a profound love and respect for Meryl's work (Out of Africa, The Bridges of Madison County, One True Thing), she doesn't really belong here either; as the numinous Clara del Valle, she just doesn't quite fit the mold.  It's a bit hard to swallow her youthful scenes as a 20-something bride (when she's actually over the hill at 44).  Everyone else is pretty much in the appropriate age bracket and make-up helps to convincingly age them as the timeline stretches on.

It's hard to figure out what the heck Glenn Close is doing here.  After smart turns as the manipulative Marquise de Merteuil (Dangerous Liaisons) and spurned lover Alex (Fatal Attraction), perhaps she needed a breather.  If her character had been played correctly (instead of being made to look like her brother's helpless prey), her performance might've been more revered.  Irons (M. Butterfly, Lolita) makes the best of what he has as the stone-cold Esteban, his icy stare and explosive intonation effectively rendered.

The real Latinos here are relegated to smaller roles, namely Antonio Banderas as the willful Pedro Tercero and Maria Conchita Alonso as Tr&aacute;nsito Soto.  Appearing here in only his second American film, Banderas is more or less a pretty face to pair with Ryder and doesn't really make much of an impression.  Good thing, too - he didn't really have the ability to flesh out a character until he starred in ""The Mask of Zorro"" five years later.  Alonso is seamless as the sultry harlot Tr&aacute;nsito, her dark luminous eyes and voluptuous figure a perfect match to Allende's descriptions (we're missing the mesmerizing snake tattoo, however).  Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vanessa Redgrave are wasted here, pushed to the background as del Valle heads N&iacute;vea and Severo and Jan Niklas as Jean de Satigny is barely given any screen time, much less a character background.  The strangest casting choice is the eerie Vincent Gallo as Esteban Garc&iacute;a, his ghostly eyes (among other anomalous facial features) and restrained voice giving me the creeps.

Overall, this is an adaptation that disappoints on many levels.  Had it been done as a low-budget independent film (with chapters - sorta like a mini-series) with unknown talents gone straight to video, it might've stood a chance.  Distinguished actors and an art house director do not a great movie make.",1012176000,,7142,5.18189730200174

mysticism and streching to epic proportions. A fictionalisd

The story of three generations in the life of one family and a man (Jeremy Irons) who works for respectability and finds redemption.

This wonderful film resembles in it's history lesson Bertulugi's 1900, another epic story of feudelism turned to facism. 1900, in facist Italy and Spirits in 1960's Chile. It really amazes me how a film so well written, wonderfully cast and beautifully photographed was so quickly and systematically dismissed by America. Could it be that America's complicity in the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Chile in 1968 and the support of the Facist regime that took power there after is history which people in a postion to voice an opinion would much rather forget? There was something favorable that was once written about remembering history. In America it seems history is better off forgotten.

1419696,5,B00005B1VQ,"I love this movie! It has a stellar cast, who give top notch performances. How can you go wrong with Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Antonio Banderas, Winona Ryder, Vanessa Redgrave, and Armin Muehler-Stahl? The answer is that you can't. It is a riveting piece of film making, based loosely upon Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name.

The film delicately captures the mysticism of the book, rendering those scenes in which such is the focal point highly believable. This is no mean feat given the subject matter. The story takes place in South America. The saga begins in the nineteen thirties.

Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Muehler-Stahl play the wealthy and liberal parents of two daughters, Rosa and Clara Del Valle. Rosa is the beautiful, older daughter. Clara, played by Meryl Streep's real life daughter, is a lovely child with exceptional, psychic gifts. Jeremy Irons plays the part of Esteban Trueba, an impoverished young man in love with Rosa. Vowing to make his fortune in order to marry her and provide her with the comforts to which she is accustomed, he succeeds in making his fortune. He loses Rosa, however, before being able to marry her, when she drinks poisoned wine intended for her liberal party father.

Esteban, broken hearted, leaves with his fortune and buys an estancia, where he sternly rules with an iron fist over the peasants who work the land for him. They obsequiously refer to him as ""Patron"". He takes what he wants, even the women, with the expected result. He has a bastard son whom he does not acknowledge.

Esteban has a spinster sister, Ferla, well acted by Glenn Close, who, for the past twenty years, has lived a grim existence in the city with their ailing mother, whom she has taken care of. When their mother dies, Esteban, now a bitter and lonely man, returns to the city from his estancia to attend his mother's funeral. In doing so, he spots Clara, who is now all grown up and ethereally portrayed by the very talented Meryl Streep. Not wasting a moment, he goes to her home. She, luminous, and mystical, already knows that he is there to ask for her hand in marriage and happily accepts. After all, she has loved him ever since she first saw him all those years ago.

Clara lovingly embraces his sister, Ferla, into the bosom of her househould, when they move to her Esteban's estancia. Ferla blossoms from a bitter old maid into a companionable and pleasant woman, under Clara's warmth. Esteban and Clara eventually have a child, Blanca, who grows up playing with Pedro, the son of the estancia's indigenous indian foreperson. When Esteban discovers this, he sends Blanca away to boarding school. He does not want his daughter fraternizing with the peasants.

Clara, loving and pure of heart, is his exact opposite. When their daughter finally grows up and returns home from school, she knows that the independent Blanca, well played by Winona Ryder, has fallen in love with her childhood playmate, Pedro, passionately portrayed by Antonio Banderas. Esteban hates Pedro, as Pedro is a liberal inciting the peasants to unionize and demand their rights, whipping them into a frenzy against the ""Patron"", or so Esteban sees it. He drives Pedro off his land. He also drives Ferla off, as he believes her to have unatural feelings for his wife, Clara. Possessive to a fault, he is consumed by jealousy. Clara and Esteban have a fight over his cruelties, and she finally leaves him, taking Blanca with her to the Del Valle family home in the city.

Meanwhile, life goes on. Blanca, pregnant by Pedro, has his child, believing that Pedro has been killed by her father. Esteban, representing the wealthy, becomes senator. He reigns for years, until the liberals win power. When they do, however, their tenure is short lived, as a militairy coup sets up a reign of terror and his old sins come home to roost. Meanwhile, Blanca discovers that Pedro is alive, and they joyously hook up again. When Blanca is picked up as a political dissident and tortured for her political views, Esteban, old and broken, is now just a bit player in a larger arena. Too late, he tries to right some wrongs. Some of the wrongs, however, can never be righted.

This is a magnificent, multi-generational family epic, that holds the viewer in its thrall. While it only loosely follows Isabelle Allende's wonderful book of the same name, it is a winner in its own right. It has something for everyone, as it deals with human nature, as well as the complex emotions, forces, and events that shape one. The film is about a family struggling to find its place in our ever changing world, and the relationships that each member of that family forges. It is a rich and vibrant tapestry, which succeeds in capturing the viewer.",996969600,,4759,4.788063337393423

1419698,1,B00005B1VQ,"Conservatives bad.  Liberals better.  Socialists (i.e., communists) best.  Why, oh why, does this seem to be the most common theme permeating almost everything that comes out of Hollywood?  Granted, considering who the author of the book is on which this movie is based one would rather expect, shall we say, a somewhat populist bent, it nonetheless grows wearying.  For those who are unaware, the author, Isabelle Allende is niece to the famous (or perhaps infamous) Salvador Allende, an avowed communist who was elected leader of Chile in the early 70s, only to be assassinated in an ill-conceived coup backed by the CIA.  Whether the coup was or was not a good idea is open to argument to this day, but we must assume it has colored the political viewpoint of Ms. Allende, and certainly is reflected in her writing.
As The House of the Spirits opens, our happy family is entertaining the notion of allowing young Esteban to marry the oldest daughter.  Right off the bat, he explains how he will work hard and become a success so as to support Rosa in the fashion to which she is accustomed.  Somehow, we're subtly led to believe there must be something wrong with him, that he would attach so much importance to being a success, and in fact he loses Rosa because he was out making his first fortune through the seat of his brow.
Rosa dies of from drinking poisoned brandy, which we're led to believe was intended for her father - who just coincidentally is a ""Liberal Party"" senator who is in a bitter fight with the ""Conservative Party.""  Bad Conservatives!  Bad!
We then follow Esteban through the next twenty years of toil and turmoil as he builds his own little personal empire.  Naturally, we can't be left to think there's anything the least bit noble about all this hard work on his part.  Instead, we're shown a particularly dark side to the man, wherein he treats his people as little more than chattel, and has his way with them in pretty much any manner he pleases.  Once again we're shown through example that the successful businessman can only be such by building his business on the broken backs of the proletariat.
Naturally, it comes as no surprise that once Esteban has taken Clara as his wife (As an aside, does anyone find it the least bit peculiar that after a mere twenty years, Clara has apparently aged from somewhere around eleven to a quite obvious forty-plus?) he continues in his power-hungry, money-grubbing, capitalistic xenophobic ways.  Indeed, he can do nothing else, since as we will soon see, Esteban is a - gasp! - Conservative.
We know he's a Conservative, for the party comes to him requesting he run for senator, since he's become quite obviously a man of means and respect.  At first he resists, but when he considers the sorry road the liberals have allowed the country to go down, he realizes it's no less than his absolute civic duty to do so.  Not to mention the fact that this will further enhance his power, which, after all, is all Conservatives are interested in (except for money, of course).
Along the way, Esteban's resolve is further hardened by the rabble-rouser Pedro, an unrepentant communist agitator who aspires to posts far beyond his position in life, and is continually whipping the peasants into a frenzy.  His romance with the padrn's daughter simply adds fuel to the fire.  In fact, one wonders what offends his sensibilities more - his daughter having an illicit relationship, or the fact she's having it with a communist peasant.
Predictably, Esteban wins his seat in the senate, the Conservatives sweep to power, and good times return to the country.  At least from the viewpoint of businessmen.  As we might expect, the lot of the ordinary workingman is worse than ever, since the country's prosperity is being built upon his sweat, blood, and broken bones.
We now come to the pivotal election, in which the People's Party, in conjunction with the Liberal Party manages to win the general elections against the Conservatives.  The transition of power seems to go reasonably smooth, but the country is beset by various shortages of heretofore readily available goods.  Esteban attributes this to the fools running the country (not really an unreasonable supposition), but his daughter makes a statement that leads us to believe that - surprise! - the Conservatives are behind the shortages and everyone knows it (A quick jaunt into basic macro-economics might tend to support this, but only in the sense that when you stop compensating producers for producing any given product, they stop producing it.).
The Conservatives then back the military in staging a coup d'tat.  This seems like a swell idea at first, but the military turns out to be a bit of a junkyard dog that's developed a taste for human blood, and the Conservatives can no longer control them.
This pretty much wraps up this transparent attempt to legitimize communism.  Naturally, there are various supporting themes and other minutiae that tend to clutter up the landscape.  I could maybe put up with it if it were at least a decent movie; however, for all the star power thrown at this left-wing plot, it just never clicks.  This is by far the most tedious movie I've seen in a long time,  and perhaps ever.  The other (occasionally uplifting) themes which run willy-nilly through this movie do absolutely nothing to offset the sheer horridness of it.",974505600,,5389,4.821932681867535

7936156,5,B00005B1VQ,"You know I tried writing a long review for the House of the Spirits but realized -thanks to wiki's page describing the characters in detail- that I can't do it.  There's just too much confusion/complexity involving the family members, so trying to sort them all out and figure out who's in a relationship with who, and how they're related to each other is impossible for me, so instead I'll just a simple review with basic thoughts.  It's much easier on my brain that way.  I've never been able to figure out relatives and how they relate to others.  I can understand the basic stuff- aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews, but this story takes family members and how they relate to a much deeper level.  The story not really bringing this to our attention so everyone's hush hush makes it that much harder.  We'll just say there's a lot of secrets within this family.

Basically the story's about Meryl Streep, who once again rises to the occasion as a phenomenal actress, and her psychic powers.  First we see Meryl as a little girl revealing events and deaths that no normal person should ever know.  Then the story switches to Meryl grown up. She retains these psychic powers.  She develops a relationship/marriage with an abusive jerk of a husband (Jeremy Irons character).  Well actually, perhaps it's fair to say he's more of a control freak and has a close-minded point of view.  He believes women should act a certain way.  Not just women, but his fellow Chile workers.  Of course nobody likes it.  Well except Meryl maybe.  I have to say, that child actress looks a lot like Meryl.  Good decision who ever chose her for the role.

The movie's based on the military dictatorship that occurred in Chile in the early 70's.  I actually had no idea this story was based on that event because the House of the Spirits comes across more like simple Americans from the late 1800's living somewhere in the country.  The dictatorship isn't brought up until much later in the movie.  Perhaps if this movie has a weak point it's that it goes for a more pretentious play-like type of acting performance and story as par the course for Meryl Streep's leading roles, instead of focusing on the harshness and brutality of the Chile event.

I think it's Meryl's sister (Glenn Close's character) who doesn't get along with the husband at all.  It gets to the point he thinks she's overstaying her welcome and later threatens her to leave and never come back or he'll kill her.  Really?  Is that kind of severe threat necessary?  Well she threatens him back with a curse which I enjoyed.  Someone like the way Jeremy's acting *deserves* to be told off.  It is kind of confusing when Glenn comes back later on while the family's having dinner, but then we find out she's only ""back"" because she died so apparently her return is another of Meryl's visions.  But... the whole family sees her.  Weird!

This story is all about complex family matters, so when Meryl's teenage daughter develops a relationship with a Chile worker, this greatly upsets her father because this guy's one of the Chile workers trying to stand up for his rights and encourages the other workers (who are basically treated like slaves) to do the same.  He's caught in the act (both making love with Jeremy's daughter and encouraging his workers to stand up) so Jeremy has to punish him.  This results in a scene where he runs around with a gun looking for him (and whipping his own daughter who won't dare mention to her father where he's hiding).  Another man approaches Jeremy and says he knows where the guy's hiding but even after a confrontation the boyfriend isn't killed- he gets away again.

Jeremy wants to control his Chile workers and later runs for the Senate to maintain order as he puts it.  Meryl and their daughter are of course against this.  This is when the story shifts away from Meryl's psychic powers and more involving the conflict going on in Chile.  Still, the story could definitely be more graphic than what we see to better show the realism of the event, but the movie writers wanted to focus on a simple family and their problems instead.

If I haven't mentioned it yet, there's another thing that makes Jeremy a scumbag.  It's that he goes around town having sex and even relationships with other women.  Yes that's right, he's a cheater.  Meryl knew about this all along but kept it a secret until she gets slapped and leaves him later on.  Later one of the women shows up to Jeremy and Meryl's back yard while they're playing outside... and she brings along a son Jeremy didn't know he had.  It's odd the story doesn't show Meryl or her sister's reaction to this and shows it from the point of view of Jeremy talking to this woman and his son alone.

That's probably not the oddest thing that happens though.  The oddest thing is when Meryl's informed her mother has been killed in an accident with her head decapitated.  Meryl has tears but is more concerned that the cops are able to locate her mother's head since, despite searching for it, the cops haven't been able to find it.  She knows exactly where it is thanks to her psychic abilities.  She takes the cops to the field, finds it right away but before they have time to turn around and head back Meryl is about to give birth to her baby daughter!  It's almost like I'm waiting for something comical to happen but no, this is treated as a serious event.

Anyway, blah blah blah.  I ramble too much!  I don't think Glenn is Meryl's sister.  They share a secret early on and promise never to tell the husband about it, but I was unable to hear it.  We just know that Glenn knows Jeremy sleeps around with women and makes love to Meryl in a sinful way and she's against it which is why she feels she has to visit the confessional.

The second half of the movie is when the story changes in a big way.  No more is the simple life of this family.  Jeremy's now a Senator, but he's helpless to do anything about the conflict in Chile so he has to take a back seat and let horrible things happen.  Such as his daughter being taken away by the new dictators of the country since she knows where her boyfriend is hiding, and so do the authorities, but she refuses to say where he is.  This results in her getting beat on despite asking to use the toilet, and having to relive a traumatic event when she was young involving a man trying to say they share the same blood and having her sit on his lap, but he actually wants to rape her.  I don't know who this man is, why he was in the house when she was younger and why the father didn't stop the rape attempt.

SPOILERS- What makes the story so extraordinary is the way the father eventually changes his beliefs and the way the daughter finally forgives his angry abusive side in order for them both to protect her boyfriend from the new dictatorship.  The family has to travel to Canada where he's hiding.  I really hate the way both Meryl and Jeremy die.  While the movie does an amazing job showing both of them age rather realistically as the story goes along, it's the way they die while having a nice peaceful conversation with a family member that just feels so tacky and lame (in the case of Jeremy, he has a conversation with Meryl who died before he did but comes back to visit him).

The acting's terrific, the storyline is CRAZY complex but not in a confusing way (well, unless you want to try figuring out how these family members are all related- THEN it gets confusing!) and even though the story feels a little Little House on the Prairie-like at times in the acting, it's still a solid well-sold story overall.  I haven't mentioned it yet by Winona Ryder does a tremendous job as the adult daughter.  I can't believe how much story time she gets in the second half.  Also I can't remember why Meryl was able to forgive her husband- she explains why later on, but I'd never be able to forgive the way he was.  His many angry-based actions and close-minded decisions are too much for me.  People can change yes, but this guy?  I don't know if I'm buying into it.  Maybe just aging changed him.  Well, and the dictators taking away his political powers and making him feel defeated of course.  But we never see his regretful ways.  We see Meryl forgive though and this *is* a movie about Meryl mostly, so maybe that's the point.  Highly recommended.",1497744000,,8353,4.510652463382157
