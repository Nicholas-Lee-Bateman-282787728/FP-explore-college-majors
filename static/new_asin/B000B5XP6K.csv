Actor/Model Shaheed Shaheed is dynamic, charming and brilliant as the lead character ""Smooth"". The supporting cast is excellent as well. I really enjoyed this film; I hope all who see it will enjoy it as well... Keep up the good work!",1129507200,,343,4.639344262295082
8592736,5,B000B5XP6K,"I commend Shaheed Shaheed, Canei Productions and all who were involved in making this movie.  The message from this movie tells one that there is no ""quick-to-get-rich"" lifestyle, without paying some serious consequences.  The actors were so real to life.  From living in an urban community, the characters  reminded me of people that I know or whom I may have heard about. This is a must see for everyone if you are really concerned about your future, but not for the kiddies.  Shaheed, Canei Productions, please keep making good movies and you will become a household name.  Peace and God's blessing to you all.",1128470400,2,613,4.846153846153846
