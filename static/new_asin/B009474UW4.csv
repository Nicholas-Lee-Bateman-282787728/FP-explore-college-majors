5257090,5,B009474UW4,reminds me of my childhood. really happy with the product. but i still wish they would release it on blu-ray,1353024000,,108,4.45
5257091,3,B009474UW4,"This set is disappointing for several reasons. Firstly, as cool as the packaging is, it's just not practical. Where the hell is somebody supposed to put that thing? The bigger issue though is that there's nothing new included here. There aren't any new special features, and the errors in episode orders throughout some of the seasons are incorrect. This is an entertaining show, but they could have improved this a bit more.",1352851200,10,425,4.916666666666667
5257092,5,B009474UW4,This upcoming christmas or whenever this DVD set will make a fine edition to my DVD collection.  I already have the Transformers and G.I. Joe collectors sets and now this will make another fine addition.,1349222400,,203,4.8

5257094,3,B009474UW4,"That's really all I can say about the show. As a kid I did grow up with this show a little, but I mostly grew up watching the three live action movies more so than this show. When in comparison to say the comic books, the original source of this show, it feels, a bit of a let down to how some of the characters were turned into, I felt it just wasn't a good adaption... imagine like how many people feels when they get a terrible live action movie adaptation of their favorite show... it's like that

It's an overall okay show on it's own accord, perhaps a bit one too many episodes for my taste, but hey, that's what popularity gets you. It feels like an eighties show, and that is hit and miss with me most of the time ie. I think Gavan (1981) is a great show, but I think stuff like Thundercats was pretty bland

as a Ninja Turtles fan, I will be happy to add this to my growing collection... now only to wish Nick will do a complete set of the 2003 show.

I give it 3/5",1348704000,3,974,4.010309278350515
5257095,5,B009474UW4,"I was 5 years old when the Ninja Turtles cartoon came out in 1987, however I was too young to be fully aware of them at the time until I was 6 turning 7. So yeah, I started getting really into them in 1989. 1989 was the same year the Michael Keaton Batman movie came out as well as the Sega Genesis. So it was a really awesome time to be a kid growing up to all that.

As a whole, the Ninja Turtles cartoon is totally fun to watch. You'll enjoy every season of it. I just wish the live action movies of the Ninja Turtles had the Turtle Van, Krang, the Technodrome, Bebop and Rocksteady. That's how much this incarnation of the Ninja Turtles meant to me.

Anyways, if you've grown up to this as a kid, you'll definitely want this. If you also happen to be a parent, this will be great for your kids. As they too need to watch this. They'll grow to love it as much as you have.

Update:
I now own this thanks to Amazon.com, it's a good thing the price went down when I ordered it. So you'll want to get this while it's cheap, because once the price goes up again, it will annoy you because no DVD box set should cost 4 times the amount that it originally sold for.",1348704000,21,1162,4.021645021645021
5257096,4,B009474UW4,"As a kid in the late 1980's and early 1990's, it was hard not to be a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They were everywhere. First there was the underground comics published by Mirage Comics. Then we got the immensely popular 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon which put the Turtles on the map. I grew up on this show with ""Turtle Fever."" As a result it is hard to separate from my feelings of nostalgia for this series in order to give an objective review. As a kid, the atmosphere of this show, combined with the animation is enough to make anybody a fan. As an adult, it is easy to not take this show so seriously. While this show was based on the more adult fare of the comics, it was watered down for kids. Seasons 1 and 2 are more action oriented (with season 1 acting as a mini-series for the origin of the Turtles). By season 3, camp ensues. In fact, seasons 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were all much more comedy based with minimal action. Season 8 brought back a lot of action that was seen in the first 2 seasons. Season 9 and 10 continued this. This series is also known for building a mythology around the Turtles, creating and giving exposure to a lot of new characters. The character designs and animation are still impressive for 80's animation as a lot of 80's cartoons were rather embarrassing. This series also has one of the most famous intro themes of any classic cartoon. Fun to watch this with your kids!",1347926400,10,1411,4.288389513108614
5257097,5,B009474UW4,"if you hadnt got the dvds then I recomand getting this, but I already have all 10 seasons so anyway I'll say a little of the show.

season 1, rocksteady and bebop as humans with random punks, before mutated. Foot soldiers are introduce. same goes with shredder, krang along with baxter stockman(only episode he had an afro not long hair), on a thing about rats episode where shredder got his mouser an build 100s of them to termintate the turtles.

season 2, after the technodrome is in deminsion X, shredder comes back without the help of krang, an the thugs bebop, rocksteady, had to break stockman out of the prison too help him, after 6 episodes on 2nd season he failed, he mutate into a fly, the frogs are introduce too, an splinter turns too human on one episode.

3rd season the technodrome is on earth again from end of 2nd season, left off, one of the turtles tempory turns too human from shredder cookies, the gang of punks from season 1 comes back on gangs all here. Baxter the fly makes 2 appearences an bye bye fly the alien computer shows up for the 1st time. Technodrome gets sucked into portal not earth an rock soldiers fire at the technodrome thinking its earth.

season 4: introduce new characters slash the evil turtle, the computer that helps baxter gets his own body, an Barney Stockman(baxter's twin brother), randomly appears an looked just like the baxter did as long haired sciencist human as of 1st half of season 2. The foot sholders take over the technodrome with one smart one, that krang makes because of firing bebop and rocksteady.

5th season: shredders brother as a police appears too one episode my brother the bad guy. as well as muck man messes up, landlord of the flies(no computer) as if that episode appeared out of no where.

6th season Irma gets super powers tempory, the gun that turns rapheal into mr nice turtle an helps the bad guy

7th season, some characters like scum bug an antrax appears out of no where, like no story to them, fly turns people into insects, etc. almost turns to human but instead gets trapped in the prison like technodrome portal, the computer gets destroyed. The shredder & Krang almost wins an takes over the world but turtles manage to get back to earth by raphael saying shreder is too chicken to fight them, lol An rids the technodrome in deminsion X. Leaving shredder an krang, 2 mutant thugs without the technodrome.

8th season, shredder blows up channel 6 building, burne an vernon blames the turtles, an some random villians appear like drakus the creator of the technodrome. Wrath of Rat King finale episode as well, same goes with Casey Jones. Shredder finally goes to the technodrome on turtles trek episode. Gargon appears too almost betrays the turtles but they won his respect at the end, an uses one of the rock warriors tanks to destory the technodrome main engines, the plant finishes its off too. Finale appearreane of the 2 dim witted thugs bebop an rocksteady, where raphael says, "" U know some times I almost feel sorry for those 2 jerks""

Season 9: Lord Dregg appears an the aliens, another good season but not one of their best because they weren't shredder, etc. in it.

10th finale season. Dregg comes back with mung this time, the last of the new bad guys. Shredder & Krang are mention in deminsion X so Mung told dregg an they bought them back to earth, instead of helping dregg, they went against dregg & turtles. 3 episodes of shredder an krang on earth, an dregg tries turning earth into another sun. Last an the finale episode. Dregg is going crazy because he been defeated so many times by the turtles an wants to terminate them by sucking 5 aliens into his body, Donatello an Mikey only chance is to go to the deminsion X where the piece of junk technodrome is still sitting there, with aliens in it, not krang an others from the past.

Rocksteady & bebop last episode(end of 8th season) the only turned to human again once on 1st episode of 4th season.
Baxter never turns to human, his last episode(revenge of the fly) at the end he almost turns too human with ray gun but gets kicked into the portal, they chase after him, get gun, shredder tries trapping all of them but the turtles beat the clock at the last seson but fly doesnt.

The punks of the gangs all here episode on season 3 isn't the same ones on 1st season.
Rest of Rocksteady and Bebops gangs turns too mutants too, one N ant eater, a dog, a lizard an a bat, an last seen in the cage at technodrome(shredder an splinter episode)1st season. Which none of this is mention on the gangs all here episode.",1347062400,10,4572,4.535194174757281

I don't know about you but I like to have my stickers applied correctly, not like 10 year old applied them. Some are crooked and one of the front window stickers is obviously slanted. Another issue I have is how the top of the party wagon doesn't fit properly. It doesn't snap or close, it just rests on the base which really cheapens the overall quality of the item. If they would have added a lip so the lid feels like it actually sits snug when you put it on would have been appropriate for a DVD case like this.",1486512000,,664,4.2362204724409445

5257164,4,B009474UW4,"Bought this item for my husband, who still loves the original Turtles series even as an adult. Came nicely packaged in original, unopened box. The details on the Turtle van are vivid and clear (not grainy looking). The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because the DVDs themselves aren't protected very well inside the van. There is only a thin foam that separates each disk and only covers a 1/4 of the DVD, so there is quite a bit exposed making me feel like they could get scratched easily. However, I still highly recommend this product for anyone who grew up watching the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! My husband loves it and is very excited to own the whole series.",1484092800,,696,4.576

5257168,5,B009474UW4,"I got this for my husband as a Christmas present and he absolutely loves it!! He has always wanted the complete series on DVD, but he insisted that it had to come in the commerative turtle van.  The van itself is a little chinsy, but that (along with the sticker decals) also makes it a bit nostalgic to some of the toys from our childhood.  It would be great if the lid (the top half of the van) clicked securely to the bottom to help protect the DVDs and it would also be nice to have a compartment for the episode guide book.  But those are very minor complaints, as my husband's reaction to the van was TOTALLY worth it.

5257183,5,B009474UW4,"Turtle fans... You need this...

It includes all 10 seasons of the 80's and 90's TMNT tv series along with episodes that somehow got forgotten about on many of the individual season's on DVD.

It is a great conversation starter and the van looks pretty cool.

I really only have three complaints and two are kind of nit picks from me.

-The roof of the van doesn't snap into place. Instead it sits on top of the van, waiting to get knocked off by pets or by picking the van up.
-The box set comes with a detailed episode list, but there really isn't a good place to store it. This is only annoying because it's nice to have the episode list if you don't want to watch every season from start to finish, i.e. if you want to watch episodes with The Rat King, or Casey Jones you can see which episodes they are in and select the proper disc to watch what you want to watch.
-The disks just sit in cut out trays basically. I'm sure there is a better way to explain the way the display is designed, but really this annoys me because if the van falls over then the discs will fall out. Unlike a conventional DVD case, the discs in this box set don't have a slot that they can actually snap into.",1474675200,6,1189,4.156521739130435

Although I don't expect him to necessarily sit down and watch the cartoons right away, I think this is something great to share with our kids one day. This made a great gift to compliment the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies that he already has in our collection. I love the cute little case the discs came in.

5257206,4,B009474UW4,"A great collection of a great TV show I grew up with.

The Good:
 - The turtle van packaging is really charming.  It even rolls on its wheels!
 - The episodes are in pretty good shape, minus a few graphical distortions here and there.  But still, nothing worth complaining about.
 - Its the TMNT cartoon for crying out loud!

The Bad:
 - The way the discs are housed means if shipping is rough several could be damaged.  Also the getting the lid to the packaging lined up perfectly can be a bit annoying.
 - Several out of order episodes.  The first disc weirdly includes ""bonus"" episodes that come from final seasons, which make no sense because they come from the midpoint from a storyline.  So don't watch those!
 - On a few seasons it can be really difficult to figure out which option you actually have highlighted, because of poor color selections on their part.

If they actually gave enough care to get the seasons/discs correct (several episodes were 'missed' in earlier seasons and just tacked on in later seasons, a couple of seasons have redundant episodes from other seasons) and shored up this van packaging just a bit it would be a perfect collection.

As is it's still a wonderful collection with a few things that'll make you roll your eyes/have to skip around a bit while watching it.  Go green machine!",1463616000,5,1321,4.605150214592275

I loved watching this a s kid and look forward to relaxing after a long day with an episode now and again.
Unfortunately, the DVD slots in the boxed set don't secure the disks enough, allowing them to shift in transit.  My set arrived with one of the disks  damaged, unplayable and Amazon hasn't listed the original seller on my order and will not allow me to exchange it.  It's a cool looking set, but it might be safer to buy individual seasons if you want to be more sure you'll be delivered an undamaged product.",1463529600,4,567,4.380952380952381

The outer box is really no good after opened. I tried keeping set in the box when watching but tried closing and and was no good. Ended up trashing it. As for the Turtle Van case itself it is very cool. It is somewhat impracticle for storing on shelf, but not a huge deal. Discs themselves are all from the individual season/volume releases thrown together. The episodes are out of order. Simple fix for that is to find an episode guide online. While it is annoying bouncing around discs. Especially with the 2 lost episodes all the way on Season 10 final disc. The set does also include a small booklet telling which discs all episodes are on, which I find to be very handy.

As for the show itself, awesome. Just a true classic. I admit it can be corny at times, but that's just part of classic 80s toons. The first 4 seasons are easily the best. LOT of great episodes. 5-10 does have lot of good episodes, but they have lot of those scrapping the barrel as well.

This would have gotten a 5 star rating but the original ""defects"" are still evident with the package. Seems Lionsgate does not care at all about fixing the issue. The episodes are not in order once you get to Season 2, which is kind of a bummer. Ran through Disc 9 and all episodes actually do play, but again not in order of the original series. Thankfully it does seem they finally got the episodes into the right seasons. If you do want to watch from beginning to end you will need a timeline of the originals to help you navigate to the right episode.",1450656000,,670,4.325396825396825

I bought one and disk two will only play all episodes if you play the whole disc at once; there is no way to choose anything but the first 2 episode. It will only play all the episodes by playing the whole disc at one time. Disk 3 is the same way. I like this series, but don't want to have to watch 6+ hours at a time. I contacted amazon with the problem, as given a return label and sent another set. It has the same problem.

5257293,4,B009474UW4,"Seasons 1,2,&3 all I can say are classic turtles! Very good cartoon.
Seasons 4,5&6 are mixed up a little with different villains instead of the same old shredder getting beaten every week, which is not a bad thing. Season six especially really stood out and is simply the best one out of the 3.
Season 7 the main season ( the last 2 disks were ok. They had some good episodes and some that were only so so but nothing bad. Now the European season really sucked. It was originally made several years back when the turtles first came out and because of that the only real bad guy in the season was shredder; which wouldn't of been so bad it they didn't put a lot of emphasis on the European culture meaning the scenery and the landmarks.
Season 8 bought a change in anaimation torwards the charector and scenery being more 3-D. April gets a wardrobe change and a new villain dominates this season. Overall the series is starting loose it's luster but it's still good
Season 9& 10 really sucked. The story line got more serious and less comical. They changed the story line to replace shredder with lord dregg, the turtles mutate uncontrollably, April is now an independent news reporter and is now more of a supporting character due to the new mutant carter that fights along side the turtles. I've read that turtles tried to compete with the Power rangers at this time which is why turtles changed so much which unfortunately it was for the worst. I felt like I was watching x-men more than turtles.
Bonus features- they had several ones that were interviews with animators, story boards artists, voice talents which I found to be all good and interesting. However, the box says over 3 hours of special features and adding all the times up it's only like 1 hour and a half. I assume they are counting the 2 bonus episodes which are not really bonus because they are part of the 193 in the season and they most likely count the 5 bonus episodes on the first season, which are actually just the last 5 episodes in the series so over all the bonus features are a little sparce.
Turtle van case was cool but a pain. The sides of the van are too big for my video cabinet and even if they weren't the van is on wheels so it would constantly roll in the cabinet. I would of bought the seasons seperetly but season 3 is 47 episodes and Amazon only sells 12 episodes of season 3. I highly recommend getting this complete series especially for fans of turtles because the original series was the best series of turtles",1429660800,3,2507,4.452173913043478
5257294,5,B009474UW4,So cool. I remember getup on Saturday mornings and watching USA for kids for the teenage mutant ninja turtles.

5257320,4,B009474UW4,"Just got mine yesterday! I gave this item only 4 stars due to quality of the item itself. See bullet points below:

 Video quality: 720x480 NTSC video. Don't expect it to be clear and clean than what you saw on TV. Yes it's in much better quality from VHS that for sure, but if more money was invested by the manufacturer who gathered all the episodes to create this remarkable set then they'd probably go to the very masters of the series and re-capture everything in a much higher quality.

 Subtitles: They are in the DVDs, however there is no option to turn them ON from the menus but to play with the player settings or your remote control. On the computer though not all players were able to even recognize that the subtitles are exist. But once you find one that does you'll find that the subtitles have been designed with a solid-black background to them, instead of a transparent one which you usually see on TV/Movies. See attached screenshot.

 Product quality (the turtles-van package design): The concept of making the package as the turtles-van is nice, however I'd prefer something more secured and convenient to store the discs like thick DVD cases that can hold up to 12 discs each, rather than having them sit on half-circled sockets which made out of cheap and bending plastic. Meaning that 2 thick cases could hold the entire collection, including the booklet that came with this set which doesn't have a proper place for it to sit in the van design. Besides it would require less space on the shelf.

To summary:
Overall and although the negative points I described above, I'm still pleased with this set and very happy I purchased it. It's a piece of nostalgic that every TMNT fan should have. That is if you don't own the seasons of the series on separated boxes already.",1424995200,32,1794,4.622641509433962

5257345,4,B009474UW4,"My inner four year old love this!!  My only beef with this box set is the inside of the package.  As you can observe from the product thumbnails, the dvds are line up on their sides.  Now, I bought two sets because in the fist one, the disc was scratched.  The 1st disc in the 2nd try was also nicked, but at the very least, it only skipped once.  I don't know if dvd scratches are anyone's fault, however.

anyways,  A great set and quite a find",1420675200,,446,4.057471264367816

5257354,5,B009474UW4,Absolutely excellent! Highly recommend this to any fan of the ninja turtles from my childhood. It includes every episode and some of the coolest packaging I have seen since the X-Men: Adamantium collection. Loving these gift sets. I have already watched season one and a few of the bonus episodes and I started the first few episodes of season 2. Some episodes I remember and some are new to me. it's all 193 episodes of the series and it's going to take a while to watch them all but having kids adds to the fun so I can have it on all the time until they take their naps. I'm glad I own this piece of history.,1419897600,,611,4.230769230769231

5257362,5,B009474UW4,This was a great gift i got myself. Wasnt sure about it at first but after this i easily recommend. The delivery was real quick and received faster than i thought. Packaged up great and carefully. Only thing is if you don't look at the little booklet you will think there are missing episodes but they are all there. Especially season 4 & 5 they are all ordered weired with 2/3 episodes on the bonus features on the final disc (season 10). But all 193 episodes are there. Great gift to self or to someone who loves the turtles and want to see how it began or for people like myswlf who grew up watching them. Either way its worth every penny and i think you get a bargain at this price. I think this way over buying season by season on dvd is alot better. Would buy again.,1419120000,,772,4.1879194630872485

Which the booklet says are all on final disc of set. So yes some episodes out of order not huge deal they are numbered in booklet but this is the most complete set you can find and its cooler to look at than the standard DVDs but yes it can roll away from you and there is no place for the booklet. I'm still glad i got this i paid $99 for it so better than $500 like some poor people did. I Have finally finished the series no problems with the infamous disc 9 some episodes are abit compressed like it was recorded on VHS but not too bad.

However, the very last episode of the collection, the episode which ended the series as we know it, was such a let down that I couldn't give it 5 stars.

5257370,1,B009474UW4,This item sucks it is missing multiple episodes and they're all out of order. Quality looks like somebody copied them from VHS to a DVD On a few. For the price I would've expected all episodes from all 10 seasons not just scattered eppisodes here and there.  By the time you get through enough of them it's too late to return it. You don't notice it until a later episode titled return of such and such when you realize you haven't seen the initial episode. Guess what. Not there. Don't buy this item. Buy them digitally thru Vudu. It cost a little more than buying the box set but worth it in the long run especially when you have to pay 1.99 each for the ones that you're missing from the box set.,1417651200,2,699,4.2556390977443606

5257416,3,B009474UW4,"Regarding the issue with disc 9, I found that when played in the computer DVD player, there are errors playing episodes 21 and onwards. The DVD freezes up and causes the computer to stop responding. However, when played in both the regular DVD player and Blu-ray player in the living room, the disk played just fine in both Play All mode and by selecting each episode individually. It just seems to be an issue when playing the disk in the computer.

Other than that issue above, all of the other disks played fine in the computer, and they all played fine in the regular DVD and Blu-ray players in my living room.

The only complaint I have is that when I received from Lionsgate, the discs were not lined up properly in the box, I had to take them out and replace them into the slots. Also the episodes on seasons 5, 6, and 7 are still out of order. It would have been nice if Lionsgate would have at least fixed the order of the episodes, especially for the price of this box set. Other than that, this is a very nice collection, and I do recommend a purchase if you have not yet done so.",1408406400,3,1091,4.265700483091788
5257417,5,B009474UW4,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Classic Series Collection is not worth this much money only sell them for $50.00 to $60.00 not much money lower the price too lower then $100.00,1407110400,,187,4.875
5257418,4,B009474UW4,"I originally shared some misgivings about the execution of this box set. The van is terrific as far as holding the discs is concerned, as instead of sleeves, they're merely held in place by shallow slots that prevent the discs from being scratched when removed form the box; however, there is nothing to lock the top securely in place, which is a bummer. The wheels do roll.

The extra episodes from the final season are still on the first season disc, meaning you have them on the set twice; the episodes are in non-chronological order, meaning the ""vacation in Europe"" side season is still bundled with the much, much later seasons. You'll need an episode guide to watch all of this in proper order. Two of the season 5 episodes are on the season 10 discs. The entire season 2 is on just one disc, and with 13 23-ish minute episodes on a single disc, you get a lot more compression artefacting than on the other ones.

The reason I'm glad I bought is that after about six months that it took me to watch the whole series, I decided for the hell of it to see how much it goes for on places like ebay, and discovered the prices had doubled or even tripled after this thing had gone out of print, so I'm glad to own something that's gone UP in value for a change.",1403481600,2,1262,4.320675105485232

Especially since you are able to buy the single seasons separately at 1/10 the cost brand new. Sure it doesn't come in a ""turtle van"" shaped box, but let's be honest, the value of that plastic she'll is next to nothing once a true fan opens it to watch the series. I swear sellers like the ones listed currently should feel ashamed. Don't waste your money. The discs are the same as if you bought the afore mentioned seasons. The only difference is the plastic turtle van disc case. Booooooooooooooo. 50.00 not 500.00.",1385942400,5,608,4.587155963302752

This sits proudly next to my Bender's Head Futurama set, but Futurama doesn't hold a candle to the cartoon series I grew up with (not in terms of story, but pure emotional joy at reliving my childhood).

All of the discs worked for me, so that is in contrast to other reviewrs who indicated their 9th disc wouldn't play. Maybe it was fixed or maybe it's just a glitch in the manufacturing. What I love is that everything looks and sounds just as I remember from the cartoon that was written to sell toys.

5257441,4,B009474UW4,"If you're a child of the '80's or 90's, then you probably grew up watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" This set collects all of the individual Lions Gate DVD releases to present the entire series in one box set. Those individual releases had some errors, all of which are repeated here since the disc contents are identical. Most of the errors are with the episode order, including 2 episodes from season 5 that were missed when that set was released, so those episodes are actually found on the season 10 disc. Some episodes are also presented multiple times across the discs. This set would have received 5 stars, but loses some points due to these errors. The disc count could have been decreased as well if they chose to redo them for this set. Some discs contain as many as 13 episodes, while others have as few as 7. If they cut out the repeated episodes, corrected the episode order, and averaged the episodes per disc, they could have saved some plastic.

The packaging is visually impressive, looking like the Turtles' Party Van. The inside has slots covered in fabric to prevent the discs from touching. It is easy to remove individual discs without touching the bottoms as well. The top is also padded. The packaging has a few flaws though. The top half doesn't secure in any way other than simply resting on top of the discs. It would have been better to have it either hinged or have a way for it to snap in place. If it were to fall off a shelf, your discs will go flying everywhere. It also comes with a booklet with an episode guide and bonus feature listing. It doesn't really fit inside the van, unless you bend it around the top of the discs. It should have been made smaller or had a compartment for it.

Due to the new Nickelodeon series, all of the Lions Gate releases are now out of print with no current plans to re-release these episodes. The complete series set now comes with a pretty steep second-market value. Used sets can sometimes be found for as cheap as $50, but new sets are rarely seen available for under $150. If you just want the episodes, the individual releases are much easier to come by (Amazon still has all of them in stock). Collecting them all that way is MUCH cheaper than this set and the only thing you miss out on is the party van. You still get every episode and bonus feature if you buy them separately.",1367020800,50,2360,4.460648148148148

Lionsgate at this moemnt isn't answering e-mails for replacement discs. If you have ordered through amazon they will do a set replacement.

I loved the series for the most part. It started to go down hill for me when Mike changes weapons to the grappling hook and the very last couple of seasons I didn't like the writing very much due to the second mutations and the constant ""what if"" scenerios.

This set is just a copy of the season sets that were out before. They didn't go back and change the out of order episodes. If you wanted to watch the episodes in order you will have to do some juggling.

Would have gave this a higher rating if there weren't so many defective  disc 9 discs just to find one that works and if lionsgate would have fixed the episode order.",1357689600,4,1102,4.360975609756098

I showed my son a couple episodes of the older cartoon online, and he loved them.  I wanted to buy him a couple seasons, but for the cost to buy just a couple random seasons (there are 10 total) seemed silly.  When this box set came out and it had the cool looking display case, I had to buy it for my son for his birthday.  He opened it up and has watched each of the 23 discs two or three times already (some discs more then that if they have favorite episodes he likes on them).  This was a great gift for a fan, and I enjoyed watching the old cartoon with him when it was too cold to go outside to play.  Great purchase, great price, great gift.  The only down side is the case's top (the top half of the van) just sits on the bottom half...so my 4 year old has knocked it over a few times and tried to pick it up and the bottom has fallen out w/ all the dvd's.

5257587,4,B009474UW4,"I would recommend this to anyone who grew up with the TMNT.  Only ""complaint"" (not really, but not sure what else to call it) would be that there is on season on two not sequential discs.  Oh, well.  Still great having the original turtles all in one collection!",1357171200,,262,4.416666666666667
5257588,5,B009474UW4,hi i bought the teen age mutant ninga turtle set i love this set even though it looks like a toy is the first thing you will notice all of the classic turtles are their the onees that i love fromed childhood and i am still watching and enjoying them even now as an adult.i love the idea of the turtle van being the cases for the dvd and you get a special guide book as well with your order. if you were brought up in the 80 then you loved the turtles every kid i knew did i was glued too the tv at 4 pm to 5 pm every afternoon first thing i turned on when i came home from school. could not getenough turtles and now i finally have a set of my own oh so happy it is well worth the price i recomend this set only if you already have the box sets of the turtles.i like this set because it is going to become a collectors item and who knows how many of theses they are going to make so i think the turtle van idea was the best and i prodly display it on the shelf as you should,1357084800,,974,3.733009708737864
5257589,5,B009474UW4,I got this for my 25 year old husband for Christmas as the original series was really cool when he was a little boy and he thought this was awesome.  His buddies (same age) also had their significant others get them this box set for Christmas as well.  I thought the $100 was good for all the DVds plus the van to store them in. All in all this was just a fun gift and I am not disappointed with it.,1356998400,,399,3.9135802469135803
5257590,3,B009474UW4,"This is a collection of the DVDs that have been released since 2004 in one beautifully nostalgic box.  If you happen to own the separate DVDs, then there is really no need to purchase this collection, unless you just have to have this Turtle Van with actual rolling wheels.  I have to admit, the packaging is very cool and reminiscent of the early 90's appearance and feel.  The same problems that the individual DVDs had when sold separately are still present... meaning there are a lot of episodes that are out of order and some that will repeat (disc one has 3 episodes from season 10, that are also on disc 23).  There is no restoration to these cartoons and a few have that, just slightly better than VHS look to them... Which, again is not that bad all things considered in keeping with the nostalgia. I still give it 5 stars regardless of the little nit-picky things.

Edit: After looking through some of the discs... Disc 9 will only play 4 of the 8 episodes.  when I try to play from my PC, the time stamp for those episodes say 00:00:00.  So, one defective disc so far... I read where someone else who purchased from Amazon had a similar problem, so I'm going to try to contact the manufacturer first... I only hope it's a hassle to get it replaced.",1356480000,7,1259,4.424242424242424

5257646,5,B009474UW4,"The packaging for this is a really nice throwback to the toys and obviously the turtle van. The inside of this case is a hard foam and is what the dvd's rest on. If you are buying this and have kids the dvd's are exposed when the lid or top half of the van is open. Just in case you do not want fingerprints on them. Overall a great product, simple dvd menus for each dvd kind of take away the wow factor of this, but hey it is not a vhs collection it is the whole first original series on dvd. If you are a fan buy it if not i'm sure one day this will be a collectors item.",1354060800,6,574,3.7520661157024793

Joe, Transformers, and of course TMNT). As a I kid, I loved this show. Still do. The Rat King is one of my favorite villains, and I much prefer Leatherhead as a bumbling villain, than a scientific do-gooder. The fact that the collection is in a TURTLE VAN carrying case is worth the collection alone. Only thing that was weird, is that in Discs 8 & 9 there is the same episode, which had me a bit confused. Probably because it was taken straight from the previously released DVD's. Which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Othar than that, I tihnk it's ""Turtleriffic"".

5257652,5,B009474UW4,"Just received mine today, and was definitely impressed.  The box reminds me of the way the actual turtle van used to be packaged back in the day, which was a nostalgic plus for me.  It's packaged beautifully, a plastic barrier on top containing the episode guide keeps it in place, and all discs were in their slots perfectly.  I like this better than separate cases because I can just pull seasons/episodes accordingly.  The case is not economical, mine is just sitting on a table for now, but I'm sure I'll find some creative way to display it, or possibly store it and put the discs in sleeves.  From the episode guide, everything seems to be in order as they were aired (although some of the episodes may not have been in correct order during the original presentation).  Watching as I type, and everything is all good, no complaints!  So glad Lionsgate finally did this, great send off for a phenomenal series.",1353110400,45,915,4.645962732919255
