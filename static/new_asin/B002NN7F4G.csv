3959762,3,B002NN7F4G,"I like the video that I saw on youtube, and decided to order this video to use in a talk I was giving. But the video is NOT just music around the world.  This video explains how/why they put it together.  That really didn't need to be explained!  It is self evident that it's about the common thread of music.  So, no I wasn't really all that crazy about it.",1449100800,,358,4.071428571428571

3959765,4,B002NN7F4G,"Just watched this, we really enjoyed it. Looking for another one with a bit more music and less ""documentary"" but that's okay, now we know the story behind this. These young guys are pretty damn impressive to have put this together like this. WE wouldn't have had any idea about all these everyday musicians that wouldn't have gotten this exposure otherwise. And for the variety/number of different countries(people) involved. Definitely shows that music can bring people together",1445558400,,480,5.246753246753247

3959778,5,B002NN7F4G,I'm in my 80's and play it almost daily.  I also purchased a copy for my daughter; she's very busy so haven't heard from her  yet.  I'm in hopes it has even more exposure on LINK  TV  even tho it has been around a while.,1418342400,,220,3.8

3959785,5,B002NN7F4G,"I first heard Stand By Me a few years ago from an email I received and was so moved by it but didn't do anything about it.  Then I heard it again recently on PBS and was brought to tears because it is so powerful.  What a wonderful concept, uniting the world through music.  Isn't that what John Lennon was trying for?  Love it!",1395964800,,328,4.078125
3959786,5,B002NN7F4G,"You don't have to be a musician to appreciate how music is a universal language. It cuts across all cultures to teach us all that we as humans can share unmeasurable joy. In a time when world peace seems impossible, these wonderful people give me hope, and make me want to help.",1394755200,3,278,4.365384615384615
3959787,5,B002NN7F4G,"I saw this on PBS several years ago, but it's never been repeated. No matter. Worth the price for this DVD. I especially loved ""Stand by Me,"" ""War/No More Trouble"" and ""One Love.""",1391990400,,179,4.454545454545454
3959788,5,B002NN7F4G,I bought this CD in order to give it as a birthday present to a friend of mine. He once confessed me that I had hit the target selecting that CD. He was very pleased having it.,1388534400,,176,3.7837837837837838

3959795,4,B002NN7F4G,Whilst I found the DVD to be really interesting again I purchased four of these in addition to 4 of the CD/DVD sets thinking that it would be the video clips and all the songs.  Dont know why - obviously didn't read the info properly when ordering - was just so impressed by the clips I saw on You Tube as were all my family that I wanted to buy them all a copy.,1318291200,,362,3.891891891891892
3959796,5,B002NN7F4G,"This DVD shows how musicians around the world can come together to make a harmonious creation.  It serves as a model of uniting for a common good.

3959798,5,B002NN7F4G,"This DVD was by far the most inspirational DVD I have ever watched.  It underscores what I have long believed and said to anyone who would listen, music is the commom denominator amongst all of of us.  When good music with meaning is sung together it makes it harder to hate your ""enemy"".  The singing teaches us that the differences between contries or cultures really are not as great as people want to believe exist.
The producers of this album did a spectactcular job of finding people throughoutthe world not only singing songs witch reflects their own culture but also made a strong point by having all of the groups sing ""Stand by Me"" and ""One Love"" together.
The DVD should should quiet even the greatest cynic.",1302480000,5,719,4.645669291338582
3959799,5,B002NN7F4G,Playing for Change is a wonderful CD.  I smile and cry when I watch this.  It is well-done.  I wish that there was more publicity about this album/DVD.,1288051200,,151,4.321428571428571

3959801,5,B002NN7F4G,The first one was overwhelming (you'll watch/listen to it over and over).  This one is just as enthrawling.,1284249600,,107,4.944444444444445

3959804,5,B002NN7F4G,"I bought the basic DVD/CD set, but not this one with the interviews, explanations, etc. Besides filling you in with the whole story, what else is different from the basic DVD with the songs? In other words, are there songs shown on this DVD that are not on the basic version? Either way, what these guys did is amazing and heartwarming, and I love the songs that I HAVE watched and listened to; music is powerful!",1273190400,,413,4.447368421052632
3959805,5,B002NN7F4G,"I saw this program on PBS.  I woke up in the middle of the night and it was on.  If you are a lover of music of all kinds, you will absolutely love this DVD.  These men actually traveled around the complete world in a year and recorded and dubbed etc.  Not only that, they had to meet these musicians and regular people and adapt to their beliefs and cultures in order to gain their confidence so that they would be accepted and allowed to tape the different talents of singing and playing all types of instruments.  Very well done and I applaud them!!!  Buy this DVD; it will be one of the best investments ever.  Also, a plus for the whole family to watch together!!",1268611200,43,668,4.253968253968254
3959806,5,B002NN7F4G,"Playing for Change is the best concept in music yet.  The album (especially the DVD version) captures the essence of what the whole ""Playing for Change"" movement is all about -- fostering world peace through music. The performers, all joining in a series of overdubs of the same songs, show that musical harmony can bring about cross-cultural harmony, and Grandpa Elliot epitomizes the powerful change music can provide in a single life.  While he was a street performer,he was picked up by the producer and included as a featured performer in the band. The production in this album is really smooth and the selection of music is right on target.  Get this album and support this worthwhile cause that has already built a school of music in one of the African villages that appear in the album.",1265760000,19,794,4.781021897810219
3959807,5,B002NN7F4G,"Peace Through Music explains why and how the ""Playing for Change"" DVD and CD came about.  It has interviews with some of the musicians who explain the importance of music as a unifying force for good.  I especially enjoy the Indian drum group from New Mexico and the Irish Protestant/Catholic youth choir and the Israeli/Palestinian musicians and the musicians from Africa and Spain.  When I start listing them, I realize I enjoy them all.  I have watched this longer DVD twice through and my favorite groups several times more.  If I were still working in middle school as the library/media guy, I would find a way to add this to our collection in the library and show snippets of it on our televised morning news program so students could see musicians from around the world creating music together and listen to their thoughts about the importance of music.",1264809600,25,860,4.783783783783784
3959808,5,B002NN7F4G,"For old hippie, peaceniks like us, this is joyous.  It's unevenly produced (outdoors in places all over the world), but wonderful, nevertheless.  It's always amazing what can be transmitted through music and this is like being right there with the musicians.  It feels personal and just great.",1264550400,7,293,5.191489361702128
3959809,5,B002NN7F4G,"I stumbled on Playing for Change about two years ago and have been hooked ever since. I was fortunate to see the live touring band play in Santa Monica, CA. If you love music at all, then this is a must have. It's such an amazing project that touches your heart. Filmed beautifully, great story(stories?), and incredible music. Buy yourself a copy and grab a few for your friends. Or better yet, have everyone over for a viewing party! Absolutely love it!",1264377600,,455,4.560975609756097

8375257,1,B002NN7F4G,"I'm sure it was lovely, but I couldn't get it to play on either of my CD players.  Afterwards my daughter said it was probably meant to be played on a computer only and that's why it was rejected.  Who knew.  Just be aware if that is the fact.  The song that made me order it was lovely and I wanted more.  Too bad.",1471392000,,315,3.859375
