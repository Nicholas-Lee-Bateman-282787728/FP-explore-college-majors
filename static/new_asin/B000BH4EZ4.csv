Holmes comes across as a patient school teacher and not the arrogant (which is usually a sign of mental illness problems) Holmes played by Brett.  There are frequent cases of subtle British humor, frequently from Holmes.  Another aspect is the small cast which plays the parts in the different episodes.  It is entertaining to figure out who is who in the characters.",1144454400,2,470,4.765432098765432
8086764,5,B000BH4EZ4,"As a longtime fan of Sherlock Holmes, I'm always looking for good portrayals on TV or in movies.  Outside of the Rathbone/Bruce series, most shows I've seen leave much to be desired, one way or another.  It was a great pleasure to recently discover the Ronald Howard/H. Marion Crawford TV series.  These shows could hardly be called serious efforts at accurately portraying the great detective and his chronicler.  And the visual quality is not great, given it's transfer from 50's tape.  The acting is spotty and often a bit over-the-top, but the actors are clearly enjoying themselves, and the stories are clever and entertaining.  If you approach these shows as good fun in a Sherlockian setting, you won't be disappointed.  If you expect a serious, authentic Holmes, you shouldn't look here.",1141776000,3,795,5.022900763358779
8086765,4,B000BH4EZ4,"I have some of these episodes on a few single disc doller DVD's but here is the complete series (all 39 episodes) on 5 single sided DVD's. From what I've seen (a few episodes on the first disc) these are complete without commercials. Picture is good but the sound is a bit scratchy however you can still hear the dialouge as the actors speak.

Looking forward to seeing every epidode one per day!!!",1140480000,4,398,4.4520547945205475
