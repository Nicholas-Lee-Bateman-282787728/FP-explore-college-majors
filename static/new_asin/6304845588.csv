I would recommend this film to anyone who likes kung fu even if only a little.  You will not be disappointed.",1105660800,5,253,4.681818181818182
949526,4,6304845588,"this is my all time favorite Kung-Fu flick.
i have seen over 200 Kung-Fu flicks...im not into the flying around with wires and cutting walls in half with 1 punch flicks.
but what i do like is the old school hardcore/hard working flicks...
(drunken master 1,shaolin vs wu-tang,prodigal son,snake and crane arts of shaolin etc etc..)
this movie,IMO if you want to see one of the best fight scenes ever created is for you.
the part where Jack Long meets the guy who was so determined to have him assasinated and Jack Long shows up bare fisted,but yet his rival has a whole weapon rack that he uses against him....Jack Long uses each weapon against him until there is no others.
this is my favorite fight scene. i don't think any movie will ever match it,the pure skill and precision ( on the original version) is just amazing...no string,no flying just pur hardcore fight seens.
the only other movie that i can honestly compare it with is the end fight seen in drunken master 1.
this is a must have for any collector.
the basic story is Jack Long has to go fight all the 7 masters of the regions to show to his secret rival that he does deserve the title as the grandmaster...each fight just shows how bad ass he is but he was never that popular as an actor,but my favorit with jackie chan being the second.
my favorite movie of all time.",1083888000,11,1335,4.430894308943089
949527,4,6304845588,"First off, the print of this dvd is great for an old-school kung-fu flick. The picture is crisp yet still has that old school feel and it has the orignal dubbed track, not some new dubbed garbage you find on most of the remastered fung-fu DVD's.  Also has orignal dialogue for fans who don't like the cheesy dubbed voices.
The movie itself is a little over rated as being one of the best ever of the genre, but it is still highly entertaining.  Predictable plot and bad hair-wigs galore...but most watch these flicks for the almost super-human fight scenes.",1082592000,15,557,4.616161616161616

Now released in 1998 (what took so long!), this film is  arguably one of if not the best kung fu movie ever made.  It combines a  solid and classic plot with classic plot twists, ""secret book of  strikes,"" animal form vs. animal form galore, grandmaster vs.  grandmaster galore, and some of the most intricate intense kung fu action I  have ever seen.  Jack Long is fantastic.  I remember seeing this film in  its theatrical release, in Times Square, NYC as part of a triple bill in  the late 70's or early 80's.

This movie was unbelievable!  I can't believe I hadn't been turned onto it prior.
Very simple, appealing plot. Choreography and complexity of fights scenes are top notch!  A few campy moves/stunts but they make for a fun and exciting flick.

I purchased it because I am in the process of getting all my old VHS tapes on DVD. I consider myself an amateur collector and as such this movie should be in the library.  But if you're looking for something with a convoluted plot masked as a mystery, I'd go for the Mystery of Chessboxing.  Same cast, better flick.

The movie does have great music in it. And it's beautifully shot.  But outside of that, I can't see anyone other than a collector being into this one.",1203379200,3,584,4.245454545454545
949654,4,6304845588,"This flick encompasses everything you expect when someone mutters, or even bellows ""old-school kung fu"".  Great premise, great fights (again, old-school), great fun.  Lots of acrobatics.  Animal styles.  Man, I love this movie.

Jack Long plays Shang Kuan Cheng, a righteous kung fu champion and hero to the people, who's about to retire when a mysterious note appears to remind him that he can't call himself champion until he has defeated all styles and masters in the province.  He agrees and postpones his ceremony until he can challenge the 7 remaining masters.  He gathers his daughter and all 3 of his students and sets about his task.  When one of his defeated opponents turns up dead, he's suspected.  Complicating things further is a persistent young man (Li Yi Min) determined to have Shang become his teacher.

This movie has it all.  Stolen manuals, Pai Mei, revenge for the killing of one's father.  Revenge for the killing of one's master.  Great sound-effects.  Pre-fight form displays.  Man, just get it already.  Did I mention it's beautifully remastered and in widescreen.  This is the best remastering job that I've seen from an independent studio.  Very few sets, mostly open cinematography.  Gorgeous.  The nice picture does allow you to see the tape that holds the actors' wigs on, but no biggy.  It's also English-dubbed, or if you prefer, subtitled.  I could do without some of the silly humor, but it's quite tame compared to its contemporaries.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  4.5

949655,5,6304845588,"This is rated as 5 stars for 'needs to be in your collection' not the 'be all end all.'  This film is what old kung fu should be, and what remastered dvds from that era should look and sound like today.  The picture and sound are great, and includes an original language track.  The story is good, if not a little predictable, but well paced.

The fights are amazing.  Some fights are true martials arts (just to see who is the best with no intention to hurt the other person), some are real fights, some are ambush/brawls.  With the different styles, the different masters, the weapons used, and then a story to wrap them together, this becomes such a great sampling of the way it should have been done back then.

The rest has been said in other reviews.  Buy it if you like, or are interested in, classic kung fu.",1195603200,4,816,4.357615894039735

949657,5,6304845588,"Makes you wonder why hollywood can't churn out a halfway decent action movie when this beauty was probably made for less than it costs for one day of catering on a set today?  Anyways... what's left to say that all the other reviewers haven't already said (and probably said better)?  Great Kung Fu movie for fans who enjoy their martial arts flicks short and definitely sweet with about an 85% fighting to 15% everything else ratio!  The characters, storyline, effects, and acting are all rather underwhelming (some awful wig applications come to mind) but the fighting is almost as good as it gets (as everyone here mentioned, the weapons fight is must see material)and delivers so much that you forgive and forget about all that other stuff that is necessary for most movies to work.  Genre enthusiasts should bless Tokyo Shock for bringing this classic to DVD (which amusingly enough was neither filmed in Tokyo or in any way shocking but...) as it fits nicely alongside many of their other excellent releases like Riki-Oh, Ichi The Killer, and Versus (well maybe it looks a little odd next to those titles, but a fantastic release either way).",1191196800,5,1148,4.841836734693878

But to see so many 5 star ratings you would expect to see excellence which I didn't I have purchased several movies that recieved low ratings that in my opinion where very good. To me the fight scenes were basic and the story line was typical done before but don't get me wrong this is a good film and well worth pocessing but not a 5 star.,1180051200,2,486,4.11578947368421
949669,5,6304845588,"I just wish I could see it for the first time again.

This movie is great. We all know Kung Fu movies typically have plots you skip after the first viewing, since they are a) convoluted b) corny as hell or c) stupid. 7 Grandmasters, however, doesn't suffer this pitfall; it has a minimalist storyline that's somewhat archetypal and fun to follow (especially when they use visual comparisons in fights between the new student and the Master). You know exactly what's going on, and enjoy the journeys of the two main characters.

Mainly, though, Jack Long steals the show. You have to expect great things from the brother of Ghostface Killer, and he doesn't disappoint. His martial and acrobatic skills are awesome to behold, and his dignified presence as a confident and reserved Grandmaster of Kung Fu is iconic.

Even if you think Kung Fu movies are all kitschy crap, try this out. You'll at least enjoy some of the great coreography. And if you're a kung fu addict, this is as good as they get.",1177372800,3,996,4.6477272727272725

One thing though...and I hope Amazon doesn't squash me like a bug for this- I realize that they have some great titles at great prices- HOWEVER you can find this exact copy for several dollars less at Best Buy (if you are close).

949678,4,6304845588,"7 GRANDMASTERS (1978) is a legendary kung fu film that's been a fan favorite for over 25 years. Good home video copies were impossible to come by until this legit DVD which offers the film letter-boxed, with 16:9 enhancement, enabling most of us, for the first time, to see the breathtaking kung fu action in all its widescreen glory. Licensed to Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters by Hong Kong's Mei Ah, the transfer was made from a high-quality print that may be the best non-Shaw Bros. print of a kung fu film yet released in the U.S. The dual language track includes both the familiar English dub and the original Mandarin track, with English subtitles.

7 GRANDMASTERS is almost a pure kung fu film, combining as it does two plot threads which sum up the essence of the genre. First we have a venerated kung fu champion, Shangkuan Chang, who must renew his status before he retires by traveling through China, accompanied by his daughter and three students, and taking on the grand masters of the title in fair bouts to prove he can still beat them. Second, he trains an eager young novice, Hsiao Ying, who has joined the party early on in the two-year journey and who gradually surpasses his existing students. We see a succession of bouts with other masters, experts in weapons and various styles (snake, tiger, mantis, monkey, etc.), all of whom must confront the Pai Mei Fist technique of Shangkuan. And we also see the young student go through the grueling process of being grudgingly accepted by the master, putting up with abuse from the other students, and practicing hard before developing his own unique style. During the course of it all, we learn of a threat to the master from his past and a hidden agenda on the part of the student.

It's a kung fu classic featuring fight choreography by Yuen Cheung Yan (one of the famed Yuen Clan) and Corey Yuen, who went on to become a top director of HK action films in his own right (YES, MADAM!, FONG SAI YUK, SO CLOSE, etc.). Corey also appears in the film as a weapons expert who is one of the grand masters. The stars are Jack Long as the kung fu master, Lee Yi Min as the new student, and Mark Long as the senior student. All three also co-starred, to great effect, in NINJA CHECKMATE (aka MYSTERY OF CHESS BOXING), also reviewed on this site. As kung fu films go, it rarely gets better than this. If I can offer one mild criticism, it's that there are so many good fights throughout the film that when we get to the final bout with the villain from the master's past, it's almost anti-climactic.",1106784000,65,2552,4.5456521739130435

Jack Long does justice to being a cool and collected grandmaster , embodying the discipline of Pac mei. The arrogance of his senior students towards the novice Li Yi Min. What  touched me was a particular scene when Li Yi Min carried the sick grandmaster on the bamboo poles,crossing  the river , When he was nearing the opposite bank, he was unbalanced, causing Jack Long  to fall into the water. His guilt was so profound that he remained outside the inn through the night, drenched from the torrential rain. Jack Longs daughter was a compassionate woman and asked him to get inside.  This scene is reminiscent of Li Yi Min's  acting in ""The Hero"" aka ""The Destroyer"" , the young Li Yi Min as a supporting cast for Wang Yu.
