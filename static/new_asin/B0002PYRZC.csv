8030450,4,B0002PYRZC,"Perhaps even more than a love story, this is a tale of friendship, and of the trials and tribulations present in both.  Its principal characters are a woman and two men.  With typical porteo candor, the film touches on such themes as unfulfilled dreams, growing old, and putting a positive spin on things. It is both timely and universal, with first-rate acting.",1274572800,8,362,4.82258064516129
8030451,5,B0002PYRZC,"No creo que esta pelicula haya ganado muchos premios pero no solo te hace reir recordandote cosas de un pasado no muy lejano (o si) con un par de ""subplots"" interesantes.  Lo unico malo de la pelicula es ver que a Soledad Silveira los aos no le han caido demasiado bien.",1215820800,2,270,4.294117647058823
8030452,5,B0002PYRZC,"Ricardo, a.k.a. Elvis (Juan Leyrado), middle-aged office furniture salesman by day and rock music afficianado by night, is inspired to arrange a reunion party for school friends he hasn't seen in 25 years.

His idea of a fun diversion turns into something much deeper when he contacts old pal Ernesto (Daro Grandinetti) to discuss the party plans over coffee.

Ernesto's thoughts turn to his teenage flame, Ana (Soledad Silveyra).  Twenty-five years earlier, Ernesto abandoned Ana so he could pursue his dreams of travel and writing.  Now he wants to know if Ana will be at the party, and whether Ricardo has seen her.

As it turns out, Ricardo sees Ana every day.  They've been married for 24 years.

Ernesto is incredulous that his Ana could have married a guy like Ricardo! He phones Ana at home and they arrange to meet for coffee.  They are both a bit disappointed in the way their lives have turned out, and both are curious about what might have been.

The story, moving back and forth between the characters' present and past, deals with the disparities between a person's actual history, memories, unfulfilled dreams, and present reality.

The film is filled with magical touches, not the least of which is a generous helping of the poetry of Mario Benedetti.  The cast is excellent, endearing and believable. The soundtrack is filled with great songs from the 1960's from Elvis to Sandro.

Although the two films are quite different, if you loved hearing Grandinetti recite Benedetti's poetry in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Side-of-the-Heart/dp/B00008O34X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Side of the Heart</a>, you'll probably enjoy this, too.

Another charming and beautiful film from Argentina.  Highly recommended!
