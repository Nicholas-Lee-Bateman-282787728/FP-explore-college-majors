2423093,2,B000BKVL8O,"This isn't completely devoid of value.  There are some good points of investigation.  However,, one should bear in mind that this is from the History Channel and, therefore, has a noticeable anti-Christian bias.

For one thing, the re-enactment of the burial and discovery of the empty tomb....uh, well, Joseph of Arimathea is the one to discover that the body is missing.  Oops!  LOL, that's a pretty basic mistake that anyone with even a cursory background in Christianity would have immediately corrected.  For those who don't now, the key witness, the ""apostle to the apostles"" was a woman, Mary Magdalene.  That's one of the reasons that the story is probably true.  (If the resurrection had been a fabricated story, then the story-tellers never would have put a mere woman in such an important role.)  So, there's something that makes one wonder whether or not the documentary has any other, scientific, mistakes.

The image transfer technique using iron oxide is given a fair bit of time, ending with a comment that researchers in STURP doubt it was the technique responsible for the image on the shroud.  Yet, none of those objections are presented.  (As it happens, it couldn't have been done that way.  When a light is shown under the shroud, the image disappears and only the blood stains remain.  That would not work with Craig's imaging technique.)

Also, there is an emphasis in the end on carbon dating, which is used to cast doubt on the validity of the shroud being that of Jesus.  Today, we know that carbon dating is not the most reliable methodology, and the carbon dating on the shroud was skewed by BOTH extreme heat of fire centuries ago and by pollen proteins probably introduced at the time of burial.

There are a couple of interesting points in this video, such as the experiment with radiation and the fireman's testimony about his experience rescuing the shroud from a blazing fire in Turin.  However, a better documentary can be found at",1350345600,7,1967,4.8558558558558556

2423096,4,B000BKVL8O,This movie is visually stunning.  The background material is interesting and revealing without getting overly technical.  I highly recommend its viewing.  It will lead the audience to seek more information and ask more questions about the Shroud itself and the subject of the Man of the Shroud.,1278374400,,294,5.212765957446808
2423097,4,B000BKVL8O,"I'm not sure I agree with everything the program offers up, but it was fascinating to watch.  I bought several books after viewing this to fill out my knowledge of the shroud (myth?).  I thought this documentary was well made and very professional.",1206144000,6,248,4.744186046511628
2423098,4,B000BKVL8O,This is a good attempt at the Shroud that had been debunked by Carbon Testing previously and shows that science sometimes does not have the last word. New findings are very convincing and shows that there is more learn than what just one test show. A highly recommended show for both believers and those with an open mind. This is one of History's Channel better attempt at being impartial and fair.,1176163200,22,399,4.633802816901408

8088255,3,B000BKVL8O,"Interesting.  However does not include the verification of cotton from the Middle Ages that was used to French ""in-weave"" and dye a patch for the corner of the shroud.  This verification was completed by 2005.",1437523200,,209,4.942857142857143

8088257,4,B000BKVL8O,"This is supposed to be done by the HISTORY channel!!  They can't get it right about who found the empty tomb???  It's obvious that virtually everyone involved with this DVD is probably an atheist or SOMEONE would have caught this glaring mistake.  While I don't believe there was an anti-Christian bias in this DVD.  It does show up in ""Noah and the great ark"".  If they can't get basic Biblical stories right, can they get anything right?

I enjoyed the part of the fires & the interview with the fire fighter.  They did touch on some of the concerns about the carbon dating but left out others.  Such as, the test was improperly done.  This was brought up by scientists immediately.  Instead of cutting 3 pieces from different parts of the cloth (which the church refused), they cut 3 pieces from one spot; thereby instead of having 3 different tests, it was essentially the same test done 3 times.  Also, about a decade later a Mexican archeologist accidently discovered that natural items (fabric & basketry) test out much later than things like pottery stone & metal.  In fact, they tend to test out about 1200 years  later than their actual age.

While they talked about the plant bits & pieces they found, they did not discuss the fact that the shroud material is made from & woven in the style typical of that region & time period.  They also left out any discussion of art history as it relates to the Shroud.

I was pleased to see that they used Barrie Schwortz . the photographer. a good deal.  He is considered to be the most ardent supporter of the Shroud as authentic.  By the way, he is an Orthodox Jew.  He has an excellent website....https://www.shroud.com/

I got this from the library & won't be purchasing a copy.

Update: May 28th I showed this to my hospice patient & a lady friend of mine.  Both of them had never really paid attention to the Shroud, though they both believed.  Both said they got chills when discussing the 3D imagery that appears when running a picture of the Shroud  through a computer program. (There is 3D information encoded in the shroud)  We ended up watching a 2 hr interview with Barrie Schwortz & George Nori on Coast to Coast AM that I found on YouTube.  There was a lot more additional information in the interview including Biblical prophecy.  George Nori, true to himself, kept asking Barrie if Barrie  thought Jesus was an alien.",1432339200,,2385,4.600950118764845
