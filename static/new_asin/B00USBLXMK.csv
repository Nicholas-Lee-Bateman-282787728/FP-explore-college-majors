8708082,5,B00USBLXMK,"Of the two films, the better on was ""Get Shorty"", but ""Be Cool"" was still very good. I know that there is a third book by the original author that features our ""hero"" and it would be nice to see it make it to the big screen too. These are what movies are supposed to be. Great casting, great acting, easy on the special effects and a captivating story.",1526428800,,352,4.115942028985507
