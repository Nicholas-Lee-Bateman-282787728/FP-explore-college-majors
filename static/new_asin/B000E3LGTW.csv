8164579,2,B000E3LGTW,"With the recent Spanish conquest of footba' (ok last ten years or so) of one pass play moving forward; exciting, skilled and a need to play as a team. Think Spurs (or Tottenham Hotspurs) nineteen sixties double team. Ok, albeit in grainy black and white of memory with concrete balls of leather and boots better suited to a builders yards. For all the Man Uke Inc, the double team has not been bettered and Bill Nicholson is El Fergies equal (not to mention Busby). Now I have to fess, I am a Toon fan through and through but I am a Greaves man meself;  my boyhood idol. But despite a few aberrations on my part to be 100% loyal, I have to say the Tottenham Hotspur double team still remains the best I have ever clapped a pair of goggle eyed balls on. So here we have it a movie about it ""Glory Days"". But no! A criminal offence! A filum with a few minutes of Mr Blanchflower (Lord Danny) amidst a dated movie and lack lustre plot. Think ""Hard Day's Night Without The Beatles"" or Woodstock with Frank Sinatra. Again, it is something that could have worked. Take 'Purely Belter' (Geordie sublime film) a similar plot but got well over the line by being side-cracking-ly funny. With even the big Al (Mr Shearer) having the mick taken. Mind you he probably does still listen to Celine Dion or some such bollocks. But this film did not do that team or era justice. Acting was not bad, the leads worked hard with a sub-standard script that was woeful. This is the kind of movie for a wet afternoon stuck at home, with a head cold and the cat on your lap.",1369958400,,1550,4.326460481099656
8164580,2,B000E3LGTW,"Disappointing television movie about a group of girls who follow Tottenham during the ""Double"" of '61.  The football aspect of the plot is incidental- the action focuses more on the melodrama in the girls' world.  Alright, but not very deep.",1259107200,,241,5.0
