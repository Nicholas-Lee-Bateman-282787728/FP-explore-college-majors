2830401,5,B000Q66Q8I,"If you got the collectors edition of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, you owe it to yourself to get this triple-feature of the remaining sequels to that movie. It's definitely a deal and, after you watch the movies, you'll see it was worth every penny.

Psycho II is the first sequel to Psycho and was released in 1983. Directed by Richard Franklin, it stars Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Meg Tilly, and Robert Loggia. The movie wasn't based on Robert Bloch's book, Psycho II.

Psycho III is the second, was directed by Anthony Perkins himself, and was released in 1986. It stars Perkins, Diana Scarwid, Jeff Fahey, and Roberta Maxwell. Perkins himself tried to direct the movie just as Hitchcock would have.

Psycho IV: The Beginning is the third, is actually a made for tv prequel(Showtime Original Movie) but you wouldn't have guessed it by watching the movie. It was directed by Mick Garris(best known for his adaptations of Stephen King stories, and is the creator of the Showtime series Masters of Horror). The movie stars again Perkins as Norman, Henry Thomas as the younger Norman Bates, Olivia Hussey as Norma Bates, and CCH Pounder as Fran Ambrose. It was filmed at Universal Studios in Florida.",1205798400,3,1198,4.891625615763547
2830402,4,B000Q66Q8I,"Twenty-two years after Alfred Hitchcock unleashed Norman Bates to the world, Anthony Perkins returned in his signature role in the first of the sequels: Psycho II. Directed by Richard Franklin, it is a handsome production and repeats some of the same thrills, although bloodier, as the original. Vera Miles returns as ""Lila Loomis,"" sister of ""Marion Crane,"" the famous shower victim played by the late Janet Leigh. Jerry Goldsmith provides a slick score that is surprisingly romantic at points, not as nerve-wracking as Herrmann's schizophrenic strings.

Released three years after the first sequel, ""Psycho III"" provided Perkins the chance to not just star in but direct the film. Perkins decided to have a little fun with the assignment and had some lighter and somewhat humorous touches along with the murderous mayhem. Though released theatrically, ""Psycho III"" looks more like a television film and, with a few edits here and there, could have aired with a disclaimer or two. Diana Scarwid co-stars as a defrocked nun, the subject of Bates' passions.

1990's ""Psycho IV"" originally aired as a production on the Showtime cable network. It is a well-acted look at the events that initiated Norman Bates' (Perkins again) actions. The always dependable C.C.H. Pounder is great as a radio personality that gets to the ""root"" of Norman. Olivia Hussey is just the right blend of beauty and paranoia as Norma Bates. Henry Thomas captures the nuances and physical movements of Perkins in his role as Norman in the flashback sequences.

A major coup for the telefilm is the fact that it utilizes much of Herrmann's music, along with new cues by Graeme Revell.

Director John Landis appears as the station manager where Pounder's character works.

Though the films pale in comparison to Sir Alfred's masterpiece, they each boast something noteworthy and entertaining...and Perkins IS along for the ride.",1198800000,16,1898,5.169381107491857
2830403,4,B000Q66Q8I,The bundled pack of the Psycho movies add a finishing touch to the original Hitchcock classic Psycho and at a very reasonable value.  This one belongs in any collectors stash as it adds the finishing touch to a masterpiece of horror.,1194652800,5,233,4.682926829268292
2830404,5,B000Q66Q8I,"It's great to have all three of the Psycho sequels in one set. Psycho II is one one DVD and Psycho III&IV is on another. I was hoping for some special features,but there aren't any on this set. Good buy for the price.",1193961600,3,217,4.069767441860465
2830405,3,B000Q66Q8I,"now i can complete my set although i would have prefered having part 4 solo instead of rebuying parts 2,3 just to get part 4 but i guess this will have to do universal really  should have released it by itselt 1st then as a complete 4 box set like they did overseas....",1192665600,2,269,4.0754716981132075
2830406,4,B000Q66Q8I,"Well.. what's GREAT? Well we FINALLY have every single Psycho film on dvd (this set insludes 2-4). ALL in widescreen, although I believe the original is STILL non-anamorphic (although I hear Universal is set to re-issue the original soon). BUT the ones in this set ARE 16x9 WIDESCEEN even 4, which I thought was straight to cable made.

What's NOT so great? Well while the price is FANTASTIC. Sadly there's ZERO in the way of special features.. and while its GREAT to have individual dics (and not wimp out and pull that dual side junk, like Mallrats and Oragzmo). Both discs are settled nicely into a regular dvd case like MOST 2 dvd sets are now, with the small hinge dvd holder.

Psycho II appears on the first with 3 and 4 on the second. SADLY I think the video quality for the latter two suffer a bit, especially 3 which didn't look so hot, to me, even on a small 19"" regular definition tv. BUT then again.. look at the price, and its the first time they've been available, especially the 4th which has not been previously available.

I will not waste your time on the. ""are the movies good?"" I am pretty sure you already know that.. BUT.. is it worth buying? If you are a completist and a fan, then ABSOLUTELY. Having all 4 on the shelf is very nice, although we could see a bigger boxset coming (I can hope). Sadly with Perkins gone we can never really get a good ""what was he thinking?"" aon Psycho III.

Still though.. I would LOVED to have at least seen some features on Psycho II which is a very worthy and creepy follow up to the original, you do get the thatrical trailers. Still I won't look a gift horse in the mouth and say if you want the movies.. then this set is a great addition to your collection.

I only drop it ONE star based on the fact that Psycho III and IV while they are on a single disc.. either more care could have been taken in the compression or 3 or better yet each had been given its own disc to acheive the best LOOKING picture for the film.. and even the video is a MINOR quibble because this is the BEST Psycho III has probably looked since it was in theaters..",1189728000,2,2099,4.263819095477387
2830407,5,B000Q66Q8I,"It's true: Universal just got around to releasing decent DVD's of Psycho II and III last year.  But this set marks the DVD debut of the often-overlooked Psycho IV.  So yes, it is a bit redundant for fans who already own 2 out of the 3 films here.  But at such a low price, I think it's worth it.

Psycho IV: The Beginning was made for the Showtime cable network in 1990.  The film was released on VHS the following year, but that tape has long been out-of-print.  The film itself achieves something quite amazing, considering (1) It's the fourth film in a series, and (2) it's a made-for-t.v. movie--not usually the mark of quality entertainment.  It was written by Joseph Stefano, who penned the classic Hitchock-directed original based (loosely) on Robert Bloch's novel.  At the time Psycho IV was made, Stefano was open about his distaste for the previous sequels, which were made without his involvement.  But for fans worried about continuity, the film doesn't really ignore the events of Psycho II and III. . .it just doesn't dwell on them.

Fans of the previous films might also be concerned (SPOILERS AHEAD) about Anthony Perkins' reduced screen time, since about 70% of the story is composed of flashback to Norman's younger days.  But the script gives Perkins some great dialogue, most of it between Bates and the late-night radio talk-show host he's called.  And Stefano--himself a long-time recipient of psychoanalysis--fills Bates' backstory with moments of both cruelty and, in rare moments, subtle beauty.

For the uninititated, parts II and III are also fine sequels (take THAT, Mr. Stefano).  Psycho II is the more well-regarded, with its slow-building suspense and more restrained approach.  I actually prefer Psycho III, which balances some over-the-top gore with black humour that I'm sure Hitch himself would have appreciated.

The bottom line is, you're getting 3 superior horror sequels at a bargain price.  What more do you need to know?  Highly recommended.",1189641600,60,1982,5.009174311926605
2830408,4,B000Q66Q8I,"I have reviewed the first three ""Psycho's"" in separate reviews. I rated the first one 5 stars the second one 4 stars the third one 3 1/2 stars and the fourth one 3 stars! The fourth entry is only available through this 2 disc triple feature set. The transfers are very good and the if you are a fan of the series the forth sequel is worth owning. The fourth entry is a sequel,but does have a lot of flash back sequences so it is part prequel too! It is interesting for fans of the series.",1188086400,2,488,4.09375
2830409,5,B000Q66Q8I,"It's about time that Universal woke up and released Psycho 4 on dvd in region 1. I have been waiting since 1999 for this.  It really should have been released by it's self or in a box set with all four films, but I'll take what I can get. Thank God I can finish the psycho collection!",1182643200,21,284,3.982456140350877

2830441,3,B000Q66Q8I,"""Psycho II"" was fair.  Vera Miles was great and her performance only generates some stars for this film.  The film was well written.

""Psycho III"" was fun.  It was an 80's slasher.  Filmed well and entertaining.

""Psycho IV"" could have been MUCH better.  The film should have been cast with C.C.H. Pounder and Anthony Perkins,  alone.  This narrative would have made for a great screenplay.  The backstory with Olivia Hussey and Henry Thomas was unnecessary and revolting.  The inclusion of incest took this from a horror film,  to repulsive.  FF through those scenes,  and this is a good film.  If more had been written with Pounder and Perkins,  Pounder as the heroine,  this film would have been a hit.",1490659200,,705,4.7899159663865545

2830558,5,B000Q66Q8I,"I am giving this DVD 5 stars just on the strength of ""Psycho II"" and ""Psycho III"". These two sequels to the original ""Psycho"" directed by the Legendary Alfred Hitchcock are well made and well acted as it continues where the plot line to the first movie ended. Neither one of these come close to comparing to Hitchcock's classic and of course all of these sequels were made after Hitch had passed away but don't let that stop you from watching these sequels. They are still suspenseful and compelling to watch as you wonder what Norman will do or have happen to him next. Of course Anthony Perkins reprises the roll of Norman Bates and his work in all of these films on the DVD are great. Perkins even gets to stretch his wings a bit by not only starring in but directing ""Psycho III"" and does a pretty good job of it.

In ""II"" the story takes up with Norman returning to his old home where he and ""Mother"" lived and his trying to start life over. Problem is there are those who won't let go of the past. Vera Miles appears in this sequel reprising her roll of Lila Loomis the sister of Marion Crane, who was played of course by Janet Leigh and murdered in that shower scene, who can't and won't forgive or let go of what Norman did to her sister. She uses her daughter, played by Meg Tilly, to try to make Norman regress back to his old self in hopes the doctors will see Norman isn't really normal after all. Problem for Lila is the plan might be working a little too well. Won't say anything more about that so not to produce possible spoiler alerts.

As you would expect ""III"" picks up where ""II"" left off and again you see Norman trying to deal with those impulses he has been trying to suppress. It doesn't help when he becomes attracted to a young lady who has shown up at the doorstep to the hotel with no place to go or stay. Nor does he known she used to be a nun who had just left the convent. Diana Scarwid plays the young lady and does I think a nice job of playing this roll. Of course it would be no spoiler alert to say Norman is fighting those old feelings but do not want to say anything more on the plot to spoil it for those who have not seen this yet.

The only one of the three movies I don't all that much for is ""Psycho IV"". It is not a bad film per say just not I thought told as well as it could have. ""IV"" is the prequel to the original ""Psycho"" telling the story how Norman came to be Norman. In the movie Perkins is talking on the phone to a radio show host talking about his past and the events in his life with his mother, played by Olivia Hussy, while the film uses flashbacks to tell the story. The story line drags a bit I feel and in some ways not as believable as the first three movies. That might be however because unlike the other three movies ""IV"" was not a theatrical release but a movie made for television. With a smaller budget and time to work with they didn't have the chance to really get into telling this prequel as it should have been. As I said this isn't a bad film but if I was rating this movie by itself I would only give it 3 stars at best.

Altogether this is a very good set to own if you loved the original ""Psycho"" and want to know the continuing story of Norman Bates. If you hadn't seen the original movie these sequels can still be interesting to watch so don't let that stop you from watching these suspenseful on the edge of your seat stories. I highly recommend this DVD.",1426464000,,3437,4.140718562874252

I'd seen Psycho lll and was not too smitten but never checked out the fourth film . Not I can re-evaluate Psycho 3 and see the forth film . The first thing I look for when a non-burn-on-demand film or set of films greets me is if there are English subtitles . Closed captions are nice and nifty too but I love those subtitles for a myriad of reasons . Thanks Universal . Now you know too....Ben,1410307200,,536,4.114285714285714

2830639,5,B000Q66Q8I,Great series for anyone looking for a classic thriller. Anthony Perkins is great for the part of Norman Bates and Afred Hichcock is a genious,1398902400,,141,4.68
2830650,4,B000Q66Q8I,Anthony Perkins does a great job in reprising his role as Norman Bates.  The story lines of the second and third movies are well written and worth viewing.  The fourth movie is mostly a waste of time and steps far outside the bounds of what Alfred Hitchcock would have found as true horror.,1398470400,,290,4.452830188679245
2830651,5,B000Q66Q8I,"These are interesting follow ups to Alfred Hitchcock,s PSYCHO. They are interesting because of Anthony Perkins' contribution and willingness to explore the Norman Bates character beyond that what he portrayed in Hitchcock,s original. I doubt that Hitchcock would have approved, but that is neither here nor there. One can only speculate. PSYCHO II plays like a direct sequel bringing in familiar characters and bringing the release of Norman Bates to the forefront to springboard the story. It has a slasher film quality about it, but the sympathetic charter here is not Bates' eventual victims, but Bates himself. The plot is contrived, but it works thematically and Jerry Goldsmith's sensitive score and a fine performance from Robert Loggia really works. It was also good to see Vera Miles return as Lila Loomis in a pivotal role. Hugh Gillin has a role here as Sheriff John Hunt and he will return in PSYCHO III and make an important presence bolstering what is perceived as Norman Bates' present state of mind in that film. In PSYCHO III Norman Bates has regressed back into his former self, but that is not clear to those that check in on him. For me, Anthony Perkins really got into the mind of Bates in this film. It is offbeat with Jeff Fahey picking up Diana Scarwid, who has just left a convent, in a rainstorm with some bizarre sexual scenes alluded to. The ice cube scene is a classic. Without saying too much, PSYCHO III is a great character study for Anthony Perkins. PSYCHO IV tries to examine Norman Bates' abuse as a child via the now grown Bates bantering with a radio call-in show host as they try to psychoanalyze him and keep him from killing another victim or so he says.",1398297600,,1694,4.726351351351352

Psycho 2 is perhaps one of the greatest sequels I have ever seen. Seldomly few series ever create a sequel worthy of having so many stars. I am 16 and have watched well over 200 horror movies, quite possibly more, and I have watched a many horror series. Alien series, Chucky Series, Scream, Saw, Of the dead's, Planet of the Apes, 28 later zombies, Children of the Corn, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Resident Evil; the list can go on. When I watched this sequel, it nearly threw me back in my seat. I would tell you the parts in the film that were breath taking to me, but I would only ruin the shock & awe to come. Trust me, this sequel was worth the 22 year wait.

This 3-DVD set gives you the three sequels in the series - Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986), and Psycho IV (1990).  Each one of these sequels is good, but my favorite is Psycho II.  None of these movies can top the original Psycho (1960), an Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece, but they are commendable sequels.  Just don't ever bother to see the 1998 remake of Psycho, a movie that never should have been made.

2830716,3,B000Q66Q8I,"This 2-disc, 3-film triple feature remains the only place to get Psycho IV until a Blu-ray release. The first three films in the Psycho franchise look great on Blu-ray. The films in this triple feature are all worth watching but contain no extras (bare-bones). Hopefully we will get a deluxe collection of Psycho I-V (the remake could be skipped though) with 6 hours of bonus content but perhaps I'm dreaming. The Psycho film franchise deserves more because this package is about as economy as you can get. The terrible Psycho remake (1998) should be avoided but it is available on its own DVD. I rate the films 4 stars and this set 3 stars for being devoid of extras.

Psycho II is one of the best sequels in horror history. Norman is released from the hospital and reopens the motel while two women try to send him back.
Psycho III is adds slasher elements to the canon (it was also directed by Perkins).
Psycho IV is even better because it works as a capstone for the quadrilogy and provides backstory on Mother.",1377907200,,1015,4.576923076923077

She has watched each movie & said they all work fine. We tried watching ""Psycho IV"" in my DVD player & it skipped a bit during the last 20 minutes, we checked the back of the disc & there were some weird marks on the disc, not scratches, more like stains on the actual disc itself. The good news - it worked on her DVD player & that's what counts since they are her movies.

I loved the first one so I really could've done without these, but hey, that's just my opinion. Sorry this isn't more thorough, they're my friend's movies so I didn't watch all three.

2830773,4,B000Q66Q8I,"I have alsways loved Hitchcock's Psycho as well as all his other works. Prefect combination of acting, music and atmosphere. A rare combination indeed. I was at a music store in Alabama and I saw Psycho 2 on the shelf for $4.99 so I picked it up along with the 1998 remake(I know its not very good, I just appreciated the effort). I watched the sequel and and other thanm it momentum slowng up for a bit, I found it very good as far as sequels go. A few years later I picked up the Triple feature with 2-4 and finally saw all the films. The psycho series did something that I think no other film series, especially, horror has done. And that is make consistent follow-ups to a landmark film. Obviously none are up to par with Hitch's original, but they are solid movies and I think that is all due to Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates that keeps us connected to the original and all subsequent directors allowed the elements that Hitchcock made in the first film permeate to the others. It in essence feels like a true continuation of the original. And once we get to Psycho IV and we actually get to see the abuse endured by Norman, it takes us back to that level of sympathy in the first film we felt for him. Are they masterpeices? Not at all. What Psycho 2-4 are however are solid psychological horror films that achieved more than any Friday The 13th, Halloween, or Saw sequel ever did.",1360800000,,1402,4.3961538461538465

2830813,5,B000Q66Q8I,"Beady-eyed, twitching Norman Bates--the late great Anthony Perkins--returns to menace audiences with three surprisingly effective sequels.
""Psycho II"" (1983) is probably the most ponderous film of the three (as far as pacing goes). After twenty-odd years in an institution, Bates is eligible for parole...much to the protests of Vera Miles, reprising her role as the sister who's been forever haunted by Janet Leigh's death (from the original). Bates returns to the motel--and his old home--and is almost immediately besieged by memories of ""mother"". The main question being: Is this all in his mind, or is the horrible past repeating itself? There are some nice wink-wink moments, such as Bates cutting a sandwich (you can hear a hair-raising scrape sound effect) and contemplating the blade. Does he lapse back into his old ways? Sorry, you have to watch. The Perkins-directed ""Psycho III"" actually delves into issues of religion & romance (yes, believe it or not, Bates almost has a girlfriend!)amidst the bloody mayhem. A young woman (Diana Scarwid) fleeing her deeply troubled past as a nun wanders onto the Bates motel property. Coinciding with a rowdy football party on the premises--which, of course, Bates gleefully slashes his way through--Bates inadvertently rescues the girl from a suicide attempt, and to his surprise, begins a courtship. There's a wonderfully bizarre showdown in a motel room between Bates & drifter Jeff Fahey--himself driven as looney-toons & applying blackmail--as these two caged-up crazies go at it to a brutally disturbing conclusion. My fave was a darkly-amusing moment in which the local sheriff--investigating the disappearance of a young woman Bates just off-ed--absent-mindedly crunches from an ice binge tainted with the victim's blood as Bates' face twitches in acknowledgment. But will ""mother"" once again interfere with Bates' chances for happiness? You can pretty much guess...The most fascinating offering is the final chapter, ""Psycho IV: The Beginning"", a prequel which cleverly fills in the blanks to Bates' past, courtesy of him chatting about matricide on a local nighttime radio talk show. Now released from the hospital, married, and starting over at a new home, Bates peels away the psychological layers of his deeply troubled past via flashbacks to his relationship to mother (played terrifically by Olivia Hussey as a pretty but seriously schizophrenic person)as moments of twisted manipulation, obsessions, and near-incest surface. As the talk show host connects the dots & conclude that their anonymous caller is none other than the notorious Bates, they become frantic with keeping him on the air & talking. Sure enough, Bates plans a ""birthday surprise""--returning to the long-abandoned, creepy Bates property to commit one more murder. But the twist ending will finally bring closure for the Bates character.
Good transfer to DVD for all three movies (although there's no ""making of"" featurettes). For fans of ""Psycho"", this is well worth the price!",1320624000,,3012,5.410638297872341

This set of DVDs has three movies based on the 1959 movie ""Psycho"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock (who had a TV series on shocking stories). It was a big hit, but seems tame by later standards. The carefully edited scenes suggested more than what you saw. One scary part was the sound of a knife blade piercing flesh. But a butcher knife is designed for cutting or slashing, it lacks a hilt to prevent the wielder's hand from sliding down the sharp blade and getting cut. Why would a horror film be so successful? Some say a recession or depression creates a market for horror films (as with the current recession or depression). These films star Anthony Perkins, who plays the part of a crazy maniac very well.

""Psycho II"" from 1983 shows Norman Bates released from a state hospital because his psychiatrist says he is cured. [No mention of politics cutting the budget so inmates are released earlier, or the use of drugs to control his condition.] Will Norman still obey his mother?

""Psycho III"" from 1986 shows Norman Bates again returning home after many years. Not much has changed, for better or worse. They show parts of older movies as a reminder. You know what is going to happen, but there will be one or two surprises. Note how people who do wrong wind up getting killed, like in some classic mystery novels.

""Psycho IV"" from 1990 shows the historical background to Norman Bates' madness. This is by far the worst of the series, as if they ran out of ideas or were on a lower budget. No mention of the local voters or any control over a dangerous house.

You should see the original 1959 ""Psycho"" as a background and a story about madness. This movie mentioned that the new highway bypassed the motel and caused a loss of customers. Does poverty cause an increase of violence, crime, and `mental illness'? So who benefits from these conditions?",1318982400,,1891,4.632835820895522

Psycho II
1983 / 113 min. / Rated R

On June 3rd 1983, ""Psycho II"" would arrive in theaters with much fanfare. Hitchcock disciple, Richard Franklin delivered a surprisingly effective sequel to arguably the world's greatest horror film (my ""Psycho"" review here). Screenwriter Tom Holland (HorrorDemons exclusive interview, click here), who would go on to write 1985's ""Fright Night,"" had creatively woven a script that had elements of mystery, horror and nail-biting suspense - with a touch of some black comedy to boot. Once again, Perkins literally steals every scene he's in while Vera Miles, who reprises her character from the original, is also quite effective. Dean Cundey's cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score are top notch while Franklin's direction is first rate. While the film is not quite in the class (or league) of the original - and it does have some minor plot holes - ""Psycho II"" is still one of the best horror films of the 1980's. Thankfully, the film's big take at the box office (it was one of the Top 20 movies of the entire year), Universal would wisely move forward on a follow-up.

Psycho III
1986 / 93 min, / Rated R

More than three years later, ""Psycho III"" would be unleashed on the horror audience, but this time Anthony Perkins would not only be the star of the film but also the director! In this underrated sequel - which picks up only three-four weeks after the events of Part II - Perkins beautifully directs the film with a keen eye for color and composition of his shots. He also has some effective segues from scene to scene. Personally, I am quite fond of the establishing shots of the ""Psycho house"" where we see the book ""In The Belly of the Beast"" lying in the weeds. If you remember, that is the same book Mary is reading in ""Psycho II"". Nice touch. Charles Edward Pogue, the writer of the 1986 remake to ""The Fly,"" captures some witty humor in his script, as well as paying homage to not only the original ""Psycho"" but also Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". Pogue also adds more complexity and even sympathy to the legendary character of Norman Bates while also providing shocking murder sequences. All the while, Perkins delivers another first rate performance of the tortured madman that you can't help but to root for. Jeff Fahey and Diana Scarwid also turn in fine performances. It was also nice to see Robert Alan Browne (Mr. Statler), Hugh Gillin (Sheriff Hunt) and Lee Garlington (Myrna) reprising their roles from ""Psycho II"". It makes the small town of Fairville all the more real. While ""Psycho III"" is far from flawless, it is still a welcomed installment in the ""Psycho"" franchise. Those who like their horror a bit more bloodier will most likely enjoy this one.

Psycho IV: The Beginning
1990 / 96 min. / Rated R

It would take more than four years before Anthony Perkins would return as Norman Bates in the made-for-cable sequel ""Psycho IV: The Beginning"". This times out, however, the original film's screenwriter, Joseph Stefano, would pen this fourth installment with Mick Garris (""The Stand"") in the director's chair. We are also treated with the return of Bernard Herrmann's classic theme - the only sequel to do so. ""Psycho IV,"" which ignores some plot points from the first three films, is still an interesting and entertaining film to absorb. Perkins, who is once again fantastic in portraying the character he made famous thirty years earlier is really a joy to watch in this. He has the role down pat. Meanwhile, Henry Thomas does a sufficient job in playing the younger Norman Bates (which was rather large shoes to fill) while we are shown his volatile relationship he had with his mother (portrayed by the sexy Olivia Hussey). And though the flashback sequences would have been better served in B&W, they still offer an interesting take on the ""Psycho"" mythology. Sadly, this would be the last film in the series due to the untimely death of the great Anthony Perkins.

This ultra affordable triple feature, which is featured on two discs (""Psycho II"" on disc one and 'III' and 'IV' share disc two), is certainly worth owning just for the films themselves. In fact, this is the only way to own ""Psycho IV"" as it has yet to get an individual release like the others. There are no extra features beyond trailers, so I can only hope that some day soon these films will get the 'special edition' treatment they so richly deserve. Seriously, why the hell hasn't Universal released a nice suped-up box set for the franchise yet???",1317427200,,4567,4.766118836915297
2830817,5,B000Q66Q8I,"Everybody knows that the original Psycho is superior to the sequels, and definitely that awful 1998 remake with Anne Heche (Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? What the hell is that?), but these sequels are still pretty good. I think my favorite is the second, then the fourth, and then the third. Altogether, for about five dollars, this is an awesome deal!

  Psycho II (1983)- This film opens with the quintessential shower scene, seguing into the opening credits with the Bates Motel sign turning from black and white into color. The film opens well, and I'm glad to see Vera Miles as the only person from the original still in the film, other than Anthony Perkins, of course. It also has Meg Tilly in it as the daughter of Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), and she falls in love with Norman. The film, of course has some killing sequences, and some good suspense leads unto the pretty brilliant ending. This movie is nothing compared to the original, but it's still a good film.

  Psycho III (1986)- I think out of the three Psycho sequels and prequels, this is the worst, but it's still not bad. The thing that's interesting about this film is that it's directed by Anthony Perkins himself. It begins with a very Vertigo-like scene, (takes place in a bell tower), which was I guess what they were trying to pull off. After that, it starts to take off. There are different things in this film that were recreated for this film (the staircase killing, that devilish smile to the camera at the end of the film), but one thing I had to say was, when a certain character dies and falls down the staircase, similar to the killing of Martin Balsam in the original ""Psycho"", I just laughed. It was such a horrible recreation and it looked so stupid, but altogether I'd say the film was intense and pretty good.

  Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990)- The last Psycho film in the series, and this one was made for TV, and I liked it. It has CCH Pounder as a radio host, and this one goes back to the 50s, during Norman's childhood. It's really interesting and has a nice ending altogether, but there's just so many things that don't fit...

  If you haven't seen these movies and don't want me to spoil it don't look ahead...

  In the original Psycho movie, of course Norman killed his mother and her boyfriend, and in the 2nd Psycho film, we get introduced to Emma Spool, Norman's real mother, and he kills her, but in the 3rd Psycho, we find out Emma Spool killed Norman's mother because she wanted her husband way back then, and in the 4th Psycho, suddenly it goes back to Norman's childhood and he clearly kills his mother and the boyfriend. How could have Emma Spool kill the mother if Norman did? And also, in the 4th Psycho, it shows that it dates back to 1954, but in the original Psycho, the sheriff said that his mother was ""dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetary for 10 years"", but that was only a six-year gap (1954-1960), which is surprising because the writer of the original Psycho (Joseph Stefano) wrote Psycho IV. It's surprising that he doesn't know that. But once you get past all that nit-picking, these sequels are pretty good. They're probably all 4 out of 5 stars.

  If you want to see the Psycho sequels, I suggest you get this Universal Triple Feature, which comes with all the movies for a cheap price. It doesn't come with any special features (just the theatrical trailers), but it's an amazing deal",1315353600,,3408,4.5499181669394435

2830850,5,B000Q66Q8I,"If you are interested in the three sequels to Hitchcock's suspense classic Psycho (1960), this is the most economical purchase you can make.  The two disc set features Psycho II (1983) on one disc, with Psycho III (1986) and Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) on the second disc.  These are apparently the same versions that were previously released, and unfortunately contain no new bonus materials.  Here's a quick rundown of the three films.

Psycho II is generally regarded as the best of the three.  After 22 years in an institution, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released back into society.  Under a doctor's care, he returns to the Bates Motel.  Some may believe that Norman is stable, but there are apparently others that feel that he is still a potential killer.  Vera Miles, who appeared in the original film, returns.  The film features a great performance by Meg Tilly, and the movie debut of Dennis Franz.
Rating: *****

In Psycho III, Norman Bates hires a drifter (Jeff Fahey) to help him manage the motel.  Unfortunately, Norman has returned to his murderous ways, and is a threat to any female at the motel, or anyone that gets in his way.  Norman's life gets more complicated, when a troubled former nun (Diana Scarwid) arrives at the motel.  Anthony Perkins makes his directorial debut in this slightly sleazy thriller.
Rating: ***

Psycho IV: The Beginning is a made for cable TV movie, featuring Norman Bates calling in to a talk radio show, reflecting on his past.  The formative years, when he was raised by his mother (Olivia Hussy) are recounted in a series of flashbacks, with Henry Thomas playing the adolescent Norman Bates.  Besides revealing how Norman became Norman, the story also features Bates contemplating another murder, and returning to the house on the hill where he grew up, to confront his past.

Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles are back, along with an outstanding cast! Also features a wonderful sound track (too bad its not in CD format).

Psycho III: When I first watched it, it scared me so badly. Truthfully, it is the most horrifying/graphic of the ""Psycho"" movies. Still, very well made, but it takes a darker path than the other ""Psycho"" movies. Also, a very interesting soundtrack...unlike anything I've ever heard.

Psycho IV: All I have to say about this one is they waited too long to make it. Anthony Perkins looks old enough to be a grandpa, but atleast this ""sycho"" takes you back to Norman's early childhood. When the movie ends, every time i watch it, i almost cry because I know that this is the end of one of the greatest horror stories of all time.

Since he has been gone for a number of years now, it can be easy to forget just how great he was.  Seeing these three films should serve to remind the viewer of the darkly unique qualities that Anthony Perkins possessed.

My favorite of these three movies is ""Psycho IV.""  In this film, Henry Thomas plays the teenage version of Norman Bates.  Of course, Thomas cannot adequately portray the full neurotic monster that was Norman Bates.  Nobody could do that but Anthony Perkins himself.  But this movie has a lot of intriguing things to say about the young Norman that should be of interest to anyone who loves the original ""Psycho.""

Here's a thumbnail comment or two on each of the three entertaining movies on this generous, inexpensive DVD:

""Psycho II"" is clever, scary, and skillfully walks the line between genuine horror and touch-in-cheek humor, neither undercutting the other.  I'd better not to say too much and just let you discover the story elements for yourself.  But it's definitely worth the trip.

""Psycho III"" is more by-the-numbers, but features (like Norman) several characters who are neither all good (or stable) or all bad, which adds some welcome complexity.  Good direction by Anthony Perkins, including some interesting, arty scene transitions.  Overall, the least assured of the bunch, but still worth a look.

""Psycho IV: The Beginning"" is probably the best thing frequent television director Mick Garris (""The Stand"" and many other Stephen King TV productions) has done.  There's good, scary, moody direction of a generally engaging, illuminating story... provided by Joseph Stephano, the original ""Psycho"" screenwriter!  I also loved the generous, effective use of Bernard Herrmann's original ""Psycho"" main theme throughout the film.  This made-for-cable production was a wonderful little discovery.

There are no real extras to speak of on this DVD, just the original trailers and promos for the films.

If you already have the original ""Psycho"" I highly recommend buying this set. Buying the films seperately will cost more money, and in this case all the films come beautifully restored with superb audio.
 ""Psycho 2"" is really one of the best sequels in Hollywood history, as we see Norman Bates being released from prison after 20 years. Anthony Perkins, who reprises his role in all the films, is magnificent, and Vera Miles returns in the second film, who is determined to prove Norman is still the murderer he always was. Part 3 features Diana Scarwid, from ""Mommie Dearest"", who encounters Norman at the hotel. They become friends as secrets of their pasts binds them. Perkins also directed the third installment. The final movie, Part 4, originally aired on cable television in 1990, and is the lesser known of the films, but it's still a great piece of film work. In this we see why Norman became the killer he was, as the film explores child abuse. Norman's mother is depicted as a crazed, abrasive, and sexually promiscuos slut who never tires of heaping scorn on her son. I have to say the woman who plays the mother in this is quite an actress.
 This DVD set should be included in everyone's DVD library. Also, you must purchase the original ""Psycho"" that comes in 2 DVD's, as it features a clean print of the film and a ton of bonus fetaures.

2830886,5,B000Q66Q8I,"This is an excellent triple feature.  It has three solid sequels to the mega hit ""Psycho"" - the film that revolutionized the movie industry.  After viewing all three features back to back, I felt extremely depressed and sad for Norman Bates.  You will learn how he became insane.  It wasn't all his fault.  The ""Psycho"" series has made me reevaluate my beliefs about the death penalty.  Norman was a serial killer but he was definitely innocent by reason of insanity.  You might be insane if you had gone through what he experienced.  Let's take a peek at his life:

  ""Psycho II"" - 5 stars.  Released during the midst of the slasher frenzy era, this sequel is nearly as good as the original.  In fact, it is one of the best sequels in horror movie history - as good as Halloween II and Friday 13th II.  Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles reprise their roles as Norman Bates and Lila Loomis.  Twenty-two years have past since Norman was arrested for stabbing Marion in the shower.  He is deemed sane and released despite protests from Lila.  Norman moves back home and the killings begin again.  Could the killer be Norman?  Has his mother returned from the grave?  Or could the killer be someone completely different?  Cute and adorable Meg Tilly (""Agnes of God"" and ""The Girl in a Swing"") stars as Mary, a co-worker who has been thrown out of her apartment; she is befriended by Norman who allows her to stay with him.  Will she die in the shower like Marion Crane?  This mystery sequel is packed with red herrings, plot twists, gory murders, and a wonderful surprise ending.  It reminded me of an Italian giallo (murder mystery).

  ""Psycho III"" - 4 stars.  Another fine sequel but it has substituted nudity for good plot development.  This one doesn't have the mystery and suspense of the previous one.  We know who the killer is.  However, ""Psycho II"" does boast a few gory death sequences.  The most imaginative, shocking one occurs at the beginning when the nun falls from the church belfry.  Diana Scarwid stars as Maureen, the disenchanted nun who is befriended by Norman.  Once again, he see her as another Marion.  Jeff Fahey (""The Lawnmower Man"") is the slimy, blackmailing musician, Duane Duke, who is hired by Norman to be his assistant.  ""Psycho III"" would've been more enjoyable if someone had been framed for the murders and the real killer escaped justice.  When first viewing this film, I had feared the series had ended but, thankfully, I was wrong.

  ""Psycho IV - The Beginning."" - 4 stars.  Prequels don't normally thrill me.  Watching them makes me feel as though I'm reliving what I've already experienced.  However, this one does an excellent job of explaining Norman's insanity.  The beautiful Olivia Hussey (original ""Black Christmas"") is excellent as Norman's schizophrenic mother.  Multi-talented CCH Pounder (""Tales from the Crypt:  Demon Knight"" and ""Face/Off"") is great as the talk show radio host, Fran Ambrose, who races against time to learn the identity of Norman's next victim.  This film has a few surprises.  The ending is left open for another sequel.

  This triple feature is a must have for ""Psycho"" fans.  You would be psycho not to purchase it.  I paid less for it than I would have for a single feature.  All three films are in widescreen.  All have trailers except for Part IV, which is on DVD for the first time.  There are no extra features such as commentaries and galleries.  I'm not an extra features person  Most of the time, I just want to see the movie.

  Spoiler Alert!  Fans of ""Psycho"" deserve another sequel.  Part IV was released eighteen years ago and was left open with Norman's wife pregnant with his child.  Today, the child would be grown.  Would he or she be homicidal like their father?  The child should be a girl; little Norma murders men who try to seduce her.  The film could be similar to Hammer's ""The Hands of the Ripper.""  She witnesses her father stab her mother to death and is emotionally traumatized.  Consequently, she continues where her father left off.",1219795200,3,4033,4.729768786127168
2830887,4,B000Q66Q8I,"This is a great set for the low price. The transfers are good and the movies are essential. Nice to have all three sequels on dvd, finally.
The only slight issue: 3 and 4 are on one disc. This isn't a double-sided disc, thankfully, but there's no chapter menus for either film. Both films have chapters, but not on interactive menus.
This set won't be around long. These three movies are due for a deluxe treatment eventually. But for now, pick this 2 disc set up. The more sales this release racks up the better the remasters will be.",1210032000,,535,4.414141414141414
2830888,2,B000Q66Q8I,"I have a personal dilike for double sided discs finding that they usually do not retain the original quality of single sided copies and are more prone to scratching.  This is particularly true if they are handled by children or people not aware there is a recording on the reverse side.

The movies themselves are not bad for sequels but as expected the quality of the films declines with each new attempt to capture the magic and suspense of the original.  The inherent problem with DVDs of this genre is that they can never deliver the same suspense and shock that the viewer obtains from the initial viewing.  All in all a better than average effort for a multisequel package.",1209168000,4,679,4.633333333333334
2830889,4,B000Q66Q8I,"Now I got all the Psychos on DVD's! Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchock started it all and years after Mr. Hitchock passed, came Psycho II, III, & IV(excluding the 98 remake of Psycho that was lousy!). Can you believe that a 1960's suspense thriller became so popular? Before Psycho III came out both Psycho & its sequel Psycho II scared the heck out of me as a child it really was scary man. Now when I saw Psycho III it too was scary but not like I & II. IV was ok good job by Joseph Stefano in showing the world the child hood of Norman Bates played by Henry Thomas. Psycho II & III shows Norman Bates in a older age and mentality, becoming sane again but mother still hasn't changed.lol.",1207872000,,690,4.234848484848484

8194240,4,B000Q66Q8I,"I don't really like II or III but IV is as good as the original .  Great casting and answers all the questions of what made Norman Bates into what he was.  I bought this set because it was cheaper than just buying IV alone.  I originally saw IV because the boyfriend of Mrs. Bates was a good friend of mine, so I had to see it.  After that, it became my favorite - maybe even better than the original.  Casting Henry Thomas as young Norman was genius.  Not only is he an excellent actor and looks like what Anthony Perkins might have been as a teen but they even made sure to cast a lefty because Perkins was a lefty!",1522022400,,617,4.0578512396694215
