8255746,2,B0014I7JZG,This is a real disapointment.  The band is terrible behind Maynard and he doesn't even sound that great. He was in his prime during this time period but this DVD doesn't show it. The clarinetist is not that great and he is even more annoying to watch. I don't recommend this DVD.,1297468800,,279,4.365384615384615
8255747,3,B0014I7JZG,"This DVD is when Maynard was the real deal.
The picture and sound quality is OK-not great. They did not have the technology they do today.
I would recommend  this to any serious jazz musician.",1285372800,,192,4.485714285714286
