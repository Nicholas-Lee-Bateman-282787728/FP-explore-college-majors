4212289,1,B003VWC52U,"It's all been done before but with talented actors. This movie should only be shown in acting school : ""Bad acting 101"".  Totaly unconvincing perfomances all around especially by Emily Hampshire, could that mean bad directing?  Don't waste time or money.",1287273600,,254,5.170731707317073
4212290,5,B003VWC52U,"I loved this movie.. Jay Baruchal is such a good actor.. I cant wait till this is out on DVD.

if you like politics you will especially like this movie and will understand some of the scenes better.. though it does not matter what political philosophy you hold..

there is a hilarious part involving Ayn Rand..

this movie is my favorite in long time.",1271894400,13,351,4.453125
4212291,5,B003VWC52U,Jay Baruchel doesn't have a single bad movie.  Worth every penny!,1421712000,,65,4.909090909090909
4212292,3,B003VWC52U,"Fresh story line coupled with cliches, funny at times. Incongruities begin with the juxtaposition of American Express sponsorship and Revolutionary symbols. I was taken by individual performances. And where else do we hear that Russian Heroic Male Choral music in a film score?",1414540800,,277,5.465116279069767
4212293,5,B003VWC52U,A very funny movie...,1412121600,,21,4.5
4212294,4,B003VWC52U,"I am always amazed with the creativity required to put out such a solidly good and unique storyline.  How did Jacob Tierney come up with this story?  Was he reading about Trotsky and said, ""hmm, his real name was 'Bronshtein' -- what if ... "" and then came up with a story about a modern day teenager whose name is Leon Bronstein and then parallels their lives with this delightfully, entertaining, wacky, story starring Jay Barubel (""She's Out of Your League"").  Jay Barubel is an extremely talented young actor and he knows how to punch a scene with a mere gesture.  His belief that he is the reincarnation of Trotsky is a joy to watch as he gets into wacky situations trying to create a workers' union at his father's company and at his high school.  My absolute favorite part was the realization of the school dance theme, ""Social Justice"" -- I thought that was hilarious!  I actually sat googling Trotsky's life the second time I watched it and came to believe that this Canadian teenager really was the reincarnation of Trostky!  :-)

Great Amazon Prime Movie to watch.",1412035200,,1075,4.650793650793651
4212295,5,B003VWC52U,Lovely smart comedy,1411862400,,19,5.666666666666667
4212296,5,B003VWC52U,"This is really really funny. I like the ""absurd"" humour. The guy who wrote the story had a very original idea, in my opinion. I would totally recommend this.",1409011200,,157,4.448275862068965
4212297,5,B003VWC52U,"I watched this with my two sons, 16 & 20, and we all loved it. I think it is a great movie if you like to use your brain AND be entertained. Jay Baruchel (loved him in ""She's Out of My League"") stars as a young man who is convinced that he is Leon Trotsky reincarnated and takes the term ""student union"" to a whole new level. It is funny and packs an inspiring message. I think we loved it because we love movies that are non-formulaic and that have authentic and quirky characters that we can relate to. My 16-year-old liked it so much that he invited some friends over to watch it with him a couple of weeks later. It has a bit of a ""stick-it-to-the-man"" theme, but I find that refreshing in our heavily programmed culture. It felt more like, ""This is one kid's coming-of-age experience"" not a ""Hey let's all become communists"" message. I would classify this in the same category as Movies like ""Griff the Invisible"" and ""The Gonzo"" which are also non-formulaic quirky comedies with some depth to them. I only wish I could find more movies like this!",1408147200,,1052,4.4
4212298,4,B003VWC52U,"3 1/2, really. It's right in between. I really like Jay Baruchel, he's the quintessential nerd. Definitely worth the watch. You won't regret it.",1406505600,,144,5.041666666666667
4212299,3,B003VWC52U,Enjoyable film. Funny in all the right places and a good underdog story that works on many character levels,1406073600,,107,4.684210526315789
4212300,1,B003VWC52U,"No redeeming qualities. At least, not in the first half hour of the movie. I tried to go further, but there was no way.",1403654400,,119,4.0
4212301,1,B003VWC52U,"I am glad that I didn't need to get very far into this movie before stopping it.  Badly cast, worse script.",1402358400,,107,4.095238095238095
4212302,5,B003VWC52U,"I am a big fan of Canadian movies,they have a very distinct personality,always well made yet economical,not a waisted  moment. Thank you CANADA for making watching movies fun again.",1400976000,,181,5.241379310344827
4212303,4,B003VWC52U,After reading a synopsis I wasn't too sure this would be worth watching however the plot was well developed and the acting was very good.  With that in mind if you're not one who can find humor in the life of Leon Trotsky and a young man who believes he is the reincarnation of the revolutionary it might not be your cup of tea.  It's not something I will watch over and over again but I will definitely watch it more than once.,1398470400,,428,4.144578313253012
4212304,5,B003VWC52U,"Everything about this movie - the concept, the cast, the storytelling - are amazing and hilarious. My husband were rolling with laughter and, at the same time, longing for our own ambitious youths.",1396483200,,197,5.0
4212305,4,B003VWC52U,"This was surprisingly good.  Some of the acting is off and some of the characters are stereotypical, but the movie really speaks to pertinent issues of today.",1395014400,,158,4.851851851851852
4212306,5,B003VWC52U,"This Canadian film takes aim from The Left and hits its mark cleverly and smartly. Jay Baruchel commands a role that deserves much more attention than this film will get from audiences. The movie manages to be serious and comic at the same time, and this can't be an easy thing for artists to achieve. Your inner liberal will love this movie.",1394755200,,342,4.532258064516129
4212307,4,B003VWC52U,"""Even if seeing only half of the film during an Air Canada flight back to England and then again on Netflix, I knew this is the best comedy I have witnessed in 2010 and one of the best things the Canadian film industry come to offer.

Even if a little stranger than a US counterpart, the film encompasses everything great in a comedy and more with smart and sharp satire through the perspective of youth. We don't get to witness a lot of films that deal with communism and solidarity in comic format through young people. This is all so splendid but may prove very controversial for parents of conservative viewpoints. Let alone, it allows teenagers, even with multiple f-words and one use of the c-word to appreciate politics and current affairs surrounding their life and schooling.

It places every particular cliche out of the bin, with the exception of Bronstein's girlfriend, to great potential. The acting is pretty good from Jay Baruchel, often known for doing corny comedies. The influx of the dream sequences (falling baby), culture of Montreal's youth, the French-English cross-speech, and the ending credits and humour give a bit of a Wes Anderson meets John Hughes and pseudo-Sacha Baron Cohen feel to the film. Slight anomalies occur with the romance subplot and the loss of plotline momentum toward the middle and early 2/3rds.

Even if you're viewpoints regarding Trotsky and Lenin speak otherwise, let not this discourage you from seeing a film that is FAR better and intelligent than The Hangover.""",1377820800,,1516,4.9372549019607845
4212308,5,B003VWC52U,"This is one of my favourite films of the past decade. Good work by writer/director Jacob Tierney. I'd originally thought of rating it 4.5 stars, but am bumping it up on the strength of the DVD extras. It's brainy enough that a neo-marxist reading list wouldn't be out of place here (perhaps for the director's cut?), but there are also some funny bits of physical comedy -- and Baruchel succeeds in making the precocious teenaged activist Leon Bronstein likable and very human. You don't have to be a history buff or a Canadian to enjoy this ... though there are a few hilarious in-jokes (references to Levesque, Parizeau, and the city of London Ontario) that had even west coast audiences laughing out loud. There are some superb supporting performances here from longtime veterans like Bujold, Feore, Rubinek, and Murphy, as well as younger actors like Mabe, Horn, Pirie, and Camacho. Even Ben Mulroney makes an appearance.

Alongside the comedy and romantic moments, the film raises some interesting questions about commitment to social change -- will Leon's idealism inspire his society, or will he become complacent or disillusioned like some of the older 60s generation he encounters? This film is really more about the soft-left perspective than about the darker side of political revolutions in the 20th century, which have already been examined by other artists like George Orwell. On the micro-scale of a high school student council, though, it works fine -- and it's also a thoughtful examination of what it actually does take to overcome apathy. A couple of years after this film's release, Montreal was filled with students in the ""Maple Spring"", one of the country's biggest protest movements. I have no idea whether the film played a role in this, but I'm certain that tens of thousands of young people went through the same struggles as Tony, Caroline, Sarah, and Skip, when they decided to pick up a banner and hit the streets -- and that's true whether they're in Cairo, Athens, or Washington DC.",1356998400,,2014,4.958579881656805
4212309,4,B003VWC52U,"Jay Baruchel (""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""She's Out of My League"" and ""Tropic Thunder"") plays a high-school student named Leon who is barking mad. To the consternation of his exasperated parents, he insists that he is the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky, the notorious Communist who was a leader of the Russian Revolution in 1917.

His first attempt at a summer job fails abysmally because he tries to organize the workers into a labor union, at his father's business! His activism causes enough trouble at school that his parents, in an attempt to punish him, condemn him to a (gasp!) PUBLIC SCHOOL for his next year of high school. Undaunted, he forges ahead, trying to create a Student Union that is a real union of students, complete with demands of the faculty. Of course his main challenge is the apathy of his classmates.

Given today's economic climate, his anti-business/anti-bankers rants actually garnered a spattering of applause in the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival audience. It is fun to see a comedy that isn't about T & A, but instead about a youthful psyche groping with some serious philosophies.

You can get this on regular DVD or Blu Ray from Amazon.com.",1335139200,3,1185,4.915
4212310,5,B003VWC52U,"This is a wonderfully dark comedy about a Canadian teenager who genuinely thinks he is the reincarnation of Lev Davidovitch Bronstein, better known as Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. He imposes his own reality on those around him, much to their frustration, but no one can deny his determination. He's a one-man wrecking ball who won't take no for an answer. Trotsky's first wife was called Alexandra and was 10 years older than him. So when our teenager meets a 27-year-old woman called Alexandra, he pursues her with enormous energy. He infuriates his father so much that he's pulled out of his expensive private school and sent to a west Montreal high school, where he angers the strict new headmaster by insisting the students be allowed to create a union. The film cracks along and there is a regular supply of laughs -- forget those who say you need an understanding of the Russian Revolution to really appreciate what's happening. The climax of the film, where the young Trotsky learns whether his attempts to unionise the school, descends into something of a cliche. That said, the director recovers his touch and ""The Trotsky"" ends on a delightful tone. This is one of the best films I've seen this year.",1290384000,16,1217,4.855769230769231
8407146,5,B003VWC52U,"This is an independent movie, but what a movie. I'm a teacher and I use it in my classroom to show my students the diference between a rebel with cause and one without. It's inspiring!!!",1518307200,,186,4.3428571428571425
8407147,4,B003VWC52U,"Great, quirky comedy about the young Canadian high school senior ""Leon Bronstein"" who vehemently believes himself to be the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky.  As a fan of Russian and Soviet history I found the parodies hilarious.

[SPOILER Alert]

(My only gripe with the creative and idealistically funny film was that our sympathetic hero is also basically a won't-take-no stalker of his ""destined"" lover, and this is presented as being okay because he is younger and more awkward than her.  Oh, the poor fellow, etc.  And b/c she eventually, by formula, agrees.  Of course, Leon is so pathetic and over-the-top in his initial attempts to woo her that all is forgiven, of course. However, this same old message has already been sent too many times in other films:  that the awkward (male) romantic comedy lead must keep trying even when ""she"" says no. And that he always succeeds.)

Other than this annoying stereotypical element of the rom-com side plot, the rest of the flick was very unique and original. The reincarnation of Trotsky.  Sheesh. I wonder how they even came up with that idea.

And...the film gives us this quotable quote:  ""Are you my Stalin?""",1493942400,,1160,4.927835051546392
8407148,3,B003VWC52U,"I like the premise of the movie and was watching it to see if it might be a good addition to the Russian Revolution unit in World History, but NO.
