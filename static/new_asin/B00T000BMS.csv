6998622,4,B00T000BMS,Vinyl Lp's became CD. VHS became DVD. DVD and TV recording has become the internet. Highly amusing with John Bloom and Kaufman from troma. I was bored with a lot of it but there is little else available like this.,1472860800,2,213,4.35

6998628,3,B00T000BMS,"An OK look into the old world of the VHS days.  But, it's kind of funny that they complain about the new technologies of today and of future but you can only see this via VOD or Blu-ray.  No DVD or hell even a copy of this on the VHS format to purchase.  Maybe it's on those formats on the Troma site?  An OK Documentary for those who are interested in this subject or those of us who worked at video stores back in the day. The guys in this documentary hold a contest to see who can find the weirdest movies on VHS and other are on here talking about the old format.  Just know that there  subjects in this bounce around a lot.  It's all fun though.  Kudos to Troma.  Don't spend a lot of money seeing this though.",1495929600,2,715,4.01418439716312
6998629,1,B00T000BMS,"Misleading title. This is awful amateur youtube quality crap. Its terrible. The title is grossly misleading. It's about three failed middle aged filmmakers who basically just goof off in front of the camera. It really has nothing to do with the decline of the VHS market. They go to closing video stores and just basically goof around. Has nothing to do with any sort of history or anything interesting. Only good as a youtube video. They do some interviews but keep cutting off the interviewees and keep laughing in the background. Really disappointing. And the three filimmakers are major douchebags.

Even the interview with Lloyd Kaufman is pretty bad. They don't even stop to show the interviews. It's just them waiting in the lobby waiting to do an interview and saying how nervous they are and that they need to set up the mic/camera before the interview, etc. This stuff shouldn't even be on camera. No wonder these filmmakers are failures. It's definitely not about the subject matter. They really wanted to just make it about them. And they are all so annoying.

 It's such a hodgepodge of interviews with no real focus. Really don't know what this is supposed to be about. Like I said, it's more of an amateur youtube video. They interview themselves at a local Goodwill laughing at the VHS titles they have available, etc. Really boring stuff.

It's all about these three failed morons and its just a complete vanity project trying to promote themselves and their crappy movies. Don't waste your money.",1495065600,16,1514,4.8565891472868215
6998630,3,B00T000BMS,"Databurst will be the next big thing after streaming, to answer Joe Bob Briggs rhetorical question about what's next for movies.  It's an old military technology typically uses by deployed submarines.  You might call it the ""ultimate"" compression technology.

But, to the film; when I was being led by the nose by an actor and a couple of officers on how to make and distribute a low budget film, the concept of making a direct to video production crossed our minds several times over.  But, I wanted to make something of quality that could be shot on the cheap, and that didn't require gobs of money.  It can be done, has been done, but , for some reason, few film makers take the time to master the craft to get well made films done.  Ergo they shoot their stuff on the cheap, and let the chips fall where they may.

The mom and pop video store was the outlet in the 80s for a variety of product, most of it just plain bad.  Workout videos, cheap gory horror  and/or hack and slash flicks, softcore porn and lousy B-grade comedies (usually aimed at teens), and then there were the mid range to high budget offerings from the majors (Warner, Paramount, MGM, Disney, so forth).  All of it was on VHS.

The film looks at all these facets, and interviews participants who were around in the 80s and making product.  We hear their thoughts and feelings on what has happened to portable media and how its fairing against downloads and streaming.  The issue of quality verse portability is never fully explored, and the so-called VHS comeback seems mainly for cult films or collectors and other aficionados of anachronistic media formats.

I guess to sum up my personal feelings is that this documentary could have been more.  It's more or less a kind of (then at least) contemporary retrospective on what had become of VHS without really fully exploring the issues of content creation and distribution.  They are looked at, don't get me wrong, but not with the kind of thoroughness that might have been done with a film that was a bit longer, less light hearted, and grabbed more mainstream players involved with feature films.

See it once.",1490140800,3,2137,4.64095744680851
6998631,1,B00T000BMS,The audio is so poor as to make the film unwatchable.,1485475200,3,53,3.909090909090909
6998632,2,B00T000BMS,"Two stars for enthusiasm, but that's it.  I found a lot of this documentary to be willfully intransigent.  Sure, sure, it's ""hep"" to like old formats like VHS.  But it seems to ignore the point that improved formats mean improved experiences; the idea that someone would deliberately choose an inferior format just makes the participants seem too absorbed in hipness.  Give me a call when they make ""Super 8 Massacre"" and lament how Super-8 is just SO awesomely superior to...well, any format really.  And they should wail about how there should be Super-8 festivals, and awards, and like that!  (NB:  I've got a bunch of Super-8 stuff, so I'm ripe for hipness!)",1483920000,2,662,4.857142857142857

6998635,5,B00T000BMS,A really good doc about vhs and how streaming is becoming more popular than physical media.  AAA+++,1479254400,,99,4.823529411764706

6998637,1,B00T000BMS,"The concept itself was good and interesting. The actual execution not so much. The whole thing needs to be drastically tightened. There are also little side moments which make a point that could have been made in a better way . (i.e driving to some strip mall to show where video store used to be and what is there now, far form shocking as strip malls always have same type of stores far from a big reveal)",1475539200,,407,4.298701298701299

8700012,5,B00T000BMS,"I loved it--very informative, a lot of info on Blockbuster and other corporate monstrosities I wasn't aware of--a well-shot. low-budget documentary, both funny and sad. I grew up on VHS and still remember buying my first player/recorder at ten years old. In my opinion, we really haven't come that far in the last 30 years; I still have as much--if not more--technical problems with streaming as I ever did with VHS tapes, but the greatest travesty is the ever increasing control that a few major corporations have over what we see on the big (or little) screen. This film really lays out that timeline; the big (and small) players, how it effects us all, etc. My only hope is that Lloyd Kaufman (of Troma Entertainment) is right: ""people aren't going to take it anymore,"" i.e. the mass produced, Disney controlled junk-food that passes for art/filmmaking. I hope he's right. See this movie and decide for yourself where we are headed. Two thumbs up.",1520553600,,950,4.8343558282208585

8700014,5,B00T000BMS,"This documentary seriously discusses the rise and fall of various commercial video media (such as BETA, VHS, DVD, etc) over the decades, as well as how dull-witted, established video distribution giants attempt to sabotage new video distribution technology, and the impact all of this has on actual film producers.

We see the chronology of VHS destroying BETA, big VHS rental chains destroying independent VHS rental business, DVD destroying VHS, streaming services destroying DVD, online piracy and Net Neutrality politics and big streaming services screwing over the actual producers of video and music products.

This documentary makes a solid point that we've moved into an age wherein video and music distribution is so cheap and easy that it's practically free and there's no incentive for consumers to actually PAY for anything.

Longtime video critic Joe Bob Briggs provides the most pertinent observation on the issue when he says that, as bad as things appear today, we can't even IMAGINE how intellectual property will be created and distributed in the future (when Amazon and Netflix and all the others become antiquated relics).  Food for thought.

As an unnecessary but amusing sideline to the serious discussion, this documentary follows a group of video collectors and indie film makers searching for obscure and arcane titles and rating the ""worst of the worst"" videos, apparently for comic relief.  It's like two different objectives in one documentary.

Worth a look, regardless.",1518825600,,1499,5.353191489361702

8700018,2,B00T000BMS,"This is an okay movie...subject sounded interesting but not done with any particularly interesting viewpoint. It's mostly just a bunch of hipsters being nostalgic for the worst possible viewing format ever made for movies. It would have been nice if these guys figured out how to level out the sound of this thing, some interviews are really quiet then suddenly someone is LOUD!  Pretty weak guys...just because you bought a Blackmagic 2.5k doesn't mean you know how to make a compelling movie.",1505001600,,494,5.024390243902439

8700020,1,B00T000BMS,"This ""documentary"" is terrible. First of all, the audio quality is quite horrible at times. It's truly an amateur endeavor, that's for sure. Second, a lot of time is wasted just watching the filmmakers shop for VHS tapes. That kind of ""entertainment"" belongs on YouTube. Third, and most importantly, the ONLY reason to watch this production is to hear from Joe Bob Briggs and Lloyd Kaufman... only they're scarcely featured! The title of this ""documentary"" sounds really promising... but it completely fails to deliver in any meaningful way. Avoid!",1502323200,4,548,5.168539325842697
