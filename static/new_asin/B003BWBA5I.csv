4107565,5,B003BWBA5I,"Great concert from a show in Germany in November 1980 alot of songs from ""No Place to Run"" and ""The Wild, The Willing and The Innocent"" I wish they would play more songs from those albums today in concert.",1309219200,4,205,4.282051282051282
4107566,5,B003BWBA5I,Despite he loss of Michael Schenker the band continued to rock as well as ever. They did a super job in selecting Paul Chapman as the new guitarist. The new music continued to be excellent and there live performance did not suffer either. Phil Mogg is terrific and the band was as cohesive as ever. Chapman did a great job on the old songs and the new songs from No Place to Run were great. Great show. I purchased my copy from Amazon,1294704000,3,434,4.240963855421687
4107567,4,B003BWBA5I,Very nice concert DVD with no gimmicks in the recording. It would be nice to see some cute chicks though! Chapman can shred with the best.,1288915200,10,138,4.346153846153846

This is classic era UFO...I love the Schenker era, and the Chapman era is right up there too...so to me this is classic era...sure and the heck is worthier than that Misdemeanor tour DVD with Atomik Tommy on guitar.

This is a fantastic concert...I mean, truly spot on, everyone is on 10...amazing show.  Glad I bought this...if you are a fan you will be too...

I am not sure if this is a complete show...but considering the date of the show, it appears the majority of UFO first album with Paul Chapman and the UFO classics are properly represented.  So NO complaints here...

Also, the picture and video and audio are all great...however, please give consideration that this was recorded 30 years ago...and it doesn't appear that any state-of-the-art remastering to the video was done, but don't let that hamper your decision to buy this everything is all good.

A great release, you will enjoy...",1288224000,19,1310,4.632034632034632
4107569,5,B003BWBA5I,"It's nice to see a concert with Paul 'Tonka' Chapman for a change. I think all the work he did with UFO is always overlooked and if you think about it UFO grew more during the time Paul was in the band than earlier on. The Wild, Willing and the Innocent was a huge album plus a big tour with Cheep Trick. I heard Chains, Chains on the radio more than Too hot to Handle. I personally liked the line up of Chapman and Neil Carter better than any other line up. It was a shame when Pete Way left after the Mechanix album because I thought the band was putting out some of their best music. I for one wish that lineup went on to make more music. This DVD shows the band on a high note with Chapman in the band and lets you see his raw talent and how good UFO was with him in the band.",1426982400,,780,3.88125

4107577,3,B003BWBA5I,"I saw this line-up with Rush when I was a kid.
Very disappointed that Schenker was gone.
After listening to new stuff with Chapman, I was impressed.
Chapman fit perfect with UFO's writing style.
Chapman is not a phenom like Schenker, but he did a great job
with UFO.
Production is acceptable for the era.  If you love UFO with Chapman,
you have to get this.  Crank it up!",1364515200,3,371,4.36231884057971

8394030,5,B003BWBA5I,"Great archival footage of one the greatest classic Rock bands. Paul Chapman shows why he may stylisticaly be different than Michael Schenker but still as vital an element in UFO. Andy Parker delivers a brilliant performance as always. Pete Way with his Bass slung low is an ominpresent force to behold and of course Phil Mogg who needs no introduction at all. If you're a fan of the Chapman era, a must have!",1458777600,,408,4.602739726027397
8394031,5,B003BWBA5I,"I do like this one and I also have the Michael Schenker Group live at Rockpalast which was recorded only a few months later. You have to have both becauser UFO is a good group, mostly with the vocals of Phil Mogg. Everyone else here is also very good and like Paul Chapman very well also but play this one and you will think that you would really like Schenker in this concert and then Play Schenkers concert and realize that you yearn for Phil Mogg to be singing at his concert.

All the players in Schenkers concert are great and so is everyone in this UFO concert. You can actually have either and be happy. I actually put Phil Mogg with his unique voice and delivery, in the same group as Paul Rogers and other projection type vocalist. Not that Gary Barden on Schenkers' DVD isn't good, he is but just too bad that there isn't anything availble with Mogg and Schenker on DVD at Rockpalast (I do have one much earlier probably when Schenker started with them but is not all that great). By the way, get the album UFO Phenomenon and you will see what I mean about Mogg and Schenker together.

Paul Chapman is a very welcome addition and really liked his performance here (check out mystery train), Pete Way is a good performer and keeps the bottom line going as well as Andy Parker and the guitarist/keyboardist, Neil Carter..........you will be impressed.

Anyway, you cant have your cake and eat too but I give this 5 stars because it is a good concert you will not be disappointed but I do recommend the MSG concert on Rockpalast as well.",1457568000,,1544,4.429577464788732
8394032,5,B003BWBA5I,"UFO IS ONE OF THE GREATEST REAL ROCK BANDS FROM 70'S THRU 80'S AND STILL ROCKING TODAY! THIS SHOW IS FROM
THE ROCKPALAST CONCERT SERIES FROM 80'S WHEN PAUL CHAPMAN TOOK MICHAEL SCHENKER'S PLACE AFTER HE QUIT.
NO PLACE TO RUN AND WILD WILLING INNOCENT ARE TWO OF UFO'S BEST ALBUMS EVEN WITHOUT SCHENKER. GUITAR AND
KEYBOARD PLAYER PAUL RAYMOND WAS REPLACED BY NEIL CARTER WHO WAS A GOOD REPLACEMENT BUT NOT RAYMOND.
THE SET LIST HAS ALL OF THEIR CLASSIC SONGS FROM THAT ERA AND THEY SHOW WHAT REAL ROCK MUSIC WAS AND IS!
PHIL MOOG ONE OF THE BEST VOCALIST IN ROCK HISTORY ALONG WITH PETE WAY ON BASS AND ANDY PARKER ON DRUMS.
PAUL CHAPMAN HAD MORE OF A BLUESY HARD ROCK STYLE THAN SCHENKER AND HE PLAYS THE CLASSICS HERE GREAT.
I'VE HAD THIS ON VHS YEARS BEFORE RELEASED ON DVD AND I DON'T HEAR MUCH IMPROVEMENT IN THE AUDIO BUT THE
PICTURE IS A LITTLE CLEARER NOT MUCH. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT AND ARE A UFO OR EVEN ROCK FAN BUY THIS NOW.",1455580800,,935,4.229050279329609
