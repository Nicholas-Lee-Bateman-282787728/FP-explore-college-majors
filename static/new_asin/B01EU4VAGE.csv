8759574,5,B01EU4VAGE,Gundam X in my opinion is a underrated anime really enjoy this one for being difffent from the gundam norm,1501372800,,106,4.35
8759575,5,B01EU4VAGE,"Gundam X is one of my favorite series.  Shame that it got the shaft as far as TV viewing went.  The series got cancelled 10 episodes early, but I feel like it still managed to decently close out the story...  You can tell somewhat that it ended early, but I've seen far worse rushed endings.",1499731200,,291,4.254545454545455
8759576,5,B01EU4VAGE,Thank you!,1489881600,,10,4.5
8759577,5,B01EU4VAGE,Gundam speaks for itself.  No review I could give would do it justice :P,1488240000,,72,4.142857142857143
8759578,5,B01EU4VAGE,"This is one of the most underrated gundam shows of all time,despite being subtitled or on dvd and not blu ray it was done well. I think i will watch it over and over again,because the subtitles were retranslated correctly this time,and its not a fan sub like the original was. Compare the versions and you will be able to see the difference.",1476144000,,341,4.428571428571429
8759579,5,B01EU4VAGE,Its so much better than I remember.,1471219200,2,35,4.142857142857143
8759580,4,B01EU4VAGE,"We finally get the second half of the Gundam X series on DVD! Although, like the first collection, it doesn't seem like the transfer is all that great, it's not unwatchable or anything. Just not hi-def. Hopefully we'll get a remastered Bluray release in the future. For now, the entire series is on DVD and this set covers episodes 20-39 on four discs. Like the first collection, it is only subbed but done well.",1468972800,3,412,4.581081081081081
