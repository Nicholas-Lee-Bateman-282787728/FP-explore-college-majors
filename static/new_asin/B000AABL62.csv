2383848,3,B000AABL62,It was OK - I thought it was a different video that I have been looking for.  It didn't go into how it was built and the aquafer.  I'll keep looking.,1405468800,,149,3.774193548387097
2383849,5,B000AABL62,"I have bought some other Machi Picchu dvd's because I doubt that I will ever go there and this one is awesome.  Great pictures, great descriptions of the place and the history and they show animated diagrams of how it was supposed to work as far as water and sewage.  And although no one knows for sure why this city was built, their speculation as to why is very scientific and interesting and believable.  Really enjoyed this and my husband did too.",1405209600,4,451,4.475609756097561
2383850,3,B000AABL62,"I chose this documentary to accompany a class that I am teaching on the pre-contact Inca Empire.  The information was sufficient for an entry level class, the visuals were helpful.  The over-all production felt a little dated and dry.  However, due to the film's redeeming qualities will continue to use it as part of my instructional program.",1392422400,,343,4.982456140350878
2383851,5,B000AABL62,We are going there in two weeks on he trip of a lifetime.  It helped us get ready to go.,1384732800,,88,3.4
2383852,5,B000AABL62,I was doing a presentation on Machu Picchu and wanted some back ground info as well as a DVD to show the class if there was time. This DVD served both purposes very well.  Very informative and easy to watch.,1376265600,,207,4.175
2383853,5,B000AABL62,"Great service!!! The order was 100% accurate and it was fast.
I gave this item 5 stars because I did not have any problems, the product was what I had read and hopped for.",1361577600,,171,4.0588235294117645
2383854,5,B000AABL62,Great DVD with educational information about the history of the Incas of Peru as only The History Channel can deliver. Excellent product.,1332028800,,137,5.2727272727272725
2383855,4,B000AABL62,This video is a good visual introduction into the site of Machu Picchu.  It's very good for use in the classroom or for the armchair adventurer.,1269734400,7,144,4.538461538461538
2383856,3,B000AABL62,This info. is just your basic info. regarding early Incas.  It discusses their building techniques and defensive approach.  It later talks about present day Incas.,1215302400,13,163,5.48
2383857,4,B000AABL62,"I've visited Machu Picchu, and I suppose I was looking to re-live some happy vacation memories, but I found the footage a bit disappointing.  Basically, we have one angle looking down on the city, but no reverse angle to see where the camera person stood, and these views are equally magnificent.  There was no mention of the Gateway to the Sun, nor the trail leading to it from the city.  I realize there were time constraints, but I would have preferred seeing this as opposed to time spent on Cusco (or Cuzco depending on your nationality).

That being said, I think they did a good job of touching on Inca history.  Not enough information to do a paper on their civilization, but to the average viewer, enough insight to introduce an often glossed over culture.

Certainly worth the time to watch it, but if you're looking for a comprehensive study on either Machu Picchu or the Inca, this isn't it.",1169078400,48,903,4.6125

8077202,5,B000AABL62,Used this book to prepare for a trip to Peru as well as when we were there.  Glad we went when we did as our said there would be restrictions on visiting the ruins at Machu Pichu.,1444780800,,179,3.8378378378378377

8077205,4,B000AABL62,"After our recent trip to Galapagos and Machu Picchu it  was very informative to get more historical background on the Incan civilization and their wonderous city.  Looking at the size and sight of Machu Picchu takes your breath away. (11,000. Feet does too) and the logistics of how and why the terraces and structures were built leaves many unanswered questions. This DVD helped fill in many of the gaps. Good DVD !!!",1408838400,3,418,4.791666666666667
