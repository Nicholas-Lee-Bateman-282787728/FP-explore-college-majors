The History channel took Roman Emperors everybody knew, selected the ones with the wildest, more twisted life styles, took out anything that might offend or upset anybody, and then tossed the whole thing into a blender.

Mr. Blond starts off with chapters on Roman culture and law.  THEN he jumps into the history of the early Emperors, starting with Julius Caesar, who was never a Emperor, and ending with Nero.  He ends the book with chapters on food and religion.  It is also lots of fun to read!",1266278400,,1810,4.869281045751634
