5055083,1,B0074NDNJ6,"This is probably one of the worst films I have ever had the dishonor to view.  It's about a serial killer who kills gay men.  Can you think of anything more depressing, particularly if you are a gay man.  I've seen the reviews on Amazon and that is why I bought the film.  Oh my God, is it just me or are people out there crazy.  How on Earth anyone could give this miserable film a good review is beyond me.",1378339200,3,408,3.9876543209876543

5055086,4,B0074NDNJ6,"This stars Pierre Perrier as Chris, he is hot and he knows he is. He leads an unconventional life in that he lives in a rubbish Puegeot van and makes money by playing poker. As he says, he is just lucky and as luck would have it he bumps into Lizzie Brouchere who plays Aurore. She is a Daddy's girl, half American, half French and half stupid, as she falls for this Romeo at the drop of a hat or as it turns out a drop of her knickers. Any way it isn't just a one night thing for either of them as the following day he whisks her off to a life of free living and free loving.

The only catch is they have to go in his van, and he also has a thing for men. When I say a thing I don't mean his trouser snake, no he sort of wants to seduce young men and then sort of kill them. Well for most this could be a big `elephant in the room' moment when she finds out, but in true lover's style, they decide they can work something out.

So not an average tale and not an average production, as the production values are really good; there is an underlying air of tension through out and there is lots of `getting it on' right from the start. The acting of the two leads is both assured and accomplished; the soundtrack is pretty good too.

To say any more might spoil the plot, but really so much does happen and there are subtle twists that keep the atmosphere of brooding dread ramped up right until the conclusion. I was pretty much hooked from the beginning. It is in French with some `American' as Chris calls it and the sub titles are all pretty good, with a ninety minute run, this is another really good independent French film so if that is your `le sac' then you should enjoy",1350777600,19,1677,4.0604229607250755

5055088,1,B0074NDNJ6,"The movie sucked royally. No tension. No grit. No reason to have the guy kill the hustlers. Flat story. No purpose. Waste of money. No danger. Are there a lot of ""no's"" in my review for a reason? Yes, don't make the same mistake I did. There was no thrill. If there was a bright spot it was dimmed by the threadbare story of a transient guy who drives around in the most obvious ""kill-mobile"" that the company ""Oskar Meyer"" would sue for making them file legal papers! Then he can't control his homosexual urges even as he beds the beautiful Brochere. It was so highfalutin' dumb I now realize some foreign movies are just as susceptible to moronic tendencies as much as American films. Though the setting is in France, Brochere reveals  her Francophile nature  and speaks the native tongue in the most unexpected places!  The creative team behind ""The Sexual Chronicles"" series among other controversial fare, did not delver AT ALL !!!!!!!!!! This is no Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy homage. They would become reanimated and kill the character and the creative team just for giving serial killing a buffoonish caricature. I scratch my head as I ponder the length and breadth of the creative team's research  They could have gone to Belgium which is across the border to research Marc Dutroux who abused and killed six girls. Gone to Canada and researched Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka who killed and raped three girls. Karla Homolka's trial was akin to the OJ Simpson trial. It was that infamous. They could have figured in the French crimes of Pierre Chanal who killed 17 boys in the 1980's or Francis Heaulme who extinguished 20 innocent lives between 1984 and 1992. Even Germany where a trucker named Volker Eckert accused of killing 19 sex workers from France and Spain between 1974 and 2006.  There are serial killers everywhere around the world today. The creative team couldn't homogenize four decent case studies to produce a credible cinema serial killer?  The clueless hapless wife is just as useless a character. I binned the disc a month ago.",1422403200,2,2070,4.800561797752809
5055089,5,B0074NDNJ6,"Very well done suspenseful movie that keeps your attention even as it slowly unfolds.  A slick wandering hustler preys on lonely attention starved women going from one to another looking for the next target until he meets the woman of his dreams.  Chris meets Aurore a bored and lonely rich girl who is at odds with her family especially her father and her life as she knows it,  and after a steamy rendezvous in the bathroom of a restaurant she knows she cannot say goodbye to Chris no matter what the cost.
As the go on a road trip filled with hot sex, and {full frontal nudity and gorgeous men} things start to come to light about the enigma that is Chris. He has a dark side, a bisexual obsession a feeling that he can only quench with being intimate with men and killing them. At first Aurore is shocked and disgusted, but as Chris starts to relate his stories to her about his experiences and what a twisted turn on it is to slap and punch and beat these men to death after sexual gratification she agrees to go along with his urges.

Along the way we see how their relationship remains strong as she tells Chris that he must start to change for their love to survive, and we see how a steamy 3 way encounter satisfies everyone minus the violence might be the key to the relationship maintaining life. At the end of the film we see that the police have apparently put one of the murders together and have proof that Chris is indeed a murderer....and a long intense and sad kiss goodbye shows not only the bond that these two share, but it just might be the last one ever.

This was a slow moving yet steamy film with a lot of sex and secrets. Very well acted as Pierre Perrier did an excellent job as Chris especially the way he moved in and out from friendly loving and very sexy man to the calculated and empowering killer.  I would def say that the underline of the movie is that his need to be sexually satisfied with men was just as strong as his disgust for them after the sex was over.  He was a volcano getting ready to boil over and only her love and acceptance seemingly kept him in check and allowed him to fulfill a fantasy without her repulsion.",1419724800,2,2164,4.302211302211302
5055090,5,B0074NDNJ6,"I was fairly surprised seeing the amount of people that did not like this film. I suppose I should interpret this as a sign that my boat has apparently long sailed from the 'normal' harbor. The fact is, I thought it was a superbly executed result for what it was after.

I'll agree that it is pretty dark and not at all comfortable to view for anyone. Nevertheless, does this always have to be a bad thing? What happened to the core tenet of guilty pleasure? Are there any among us that can honestly claim to be pure pugilists of all things decadent? We are a group that has been classified as hopeless sodomites for most all of human civilization.

I guess it is somewhat comforting to see so many men repulsed by this work since it must be an indication that us sodomites are evolving toward was is mostly dead center at this point. I might have mocked people passing judgment on this film 30 years ago and declared them hypocrites. Times have changed, I guess. though sadly, for me, not so much it seems. Or is it actually a pleasure to still remain in the fringes of mainstream? I think my presence on the ledge is good for my health. Being completely sane and and mostly free of deviance sounds like a big damn bore. A bit of twist in your mind is necessary. If I were to start on the path that led to me being offended by movies like this, I would probably spend all my time as I age trying to discover the meaning and reasons of life in our form. I can't think of a faster way to cognitive atrophy than trying to become a valuable member of our moral society. Screw that! I have just this one ride on this spinning rock and most of that is behind me. I'm happy to say that there is no piece of Film noir that I have ever met that could offend this old homo. And should I choose toroot for the bad guy, that's my right as well as my pleasure.

My experience with this film was fairly intense.

From my first viewing many years ago I have rooted for this particular bad guy! This alone is a testament to the power of this filmmaker's creative abilities. I don't think I could give any higher kudos than a proclamation that I wanted a serial rapist of young boys to continue his merriment if that makes him happy!  :-(
American Translation delivered to me an experience of pure escapism, albeit at the cost of some ugly self introspection.

It certainly does not happen often - so don't have the authorities sent to me with a butterfly net - But we humans tend to experience occasions where we surprisingly find ourselves 30 seconds into in a creepy, voyeuristic gaze at something that should have repelled our eyes..

Against all common sense and in defiance of our normal morality we realize that the stare is enthralling and exciting even though we know it to be wholly inappropriate.

I guess this is triggered with some people in the form of prolonged fixation on a particularly nasty car wreck. I think we all have an ""evil = good"" gene that can rear itself at any time.

I understand the 1 star reviews and extreme comments - and can even recognize them as proper and good - but I just can't seem to take a sip of your Kool-Aid (probably because I don't want to since I am - with regards to this particular film - enjoying being NOT part of the Cool - Kool-Aid Crew).

I do not look at car wrecks. However, I found myself not only sympathetic to Chris but also completely undisturbed by his hobby. I found him to be a source of sexual energy and physical beauty that proved hypnotic to me. If it were real life, I think Chris could have sent me out to dispose of bodies and evidence simply by unbuttoning his shirt or even better, getting naked around me much as he is this entire film around Aurore.

The overt, almost coy sexuality he displayed from the moment they met was by design. It was exhibited to Aurore only as his primary manipulative weapon - simply a tool for finding his unlikely partner in these atrocities. A partner that was turned to putty and controlled by the mere sight of his um, exposed frontal area. Her weakness for him also made her a perfect person to mold because conveniently she also had a home, rich dad, maid service and all the trappings one needs in his line of work. He was fresh from the realization that he now needed kill more. Living and operating out of his van would not allow the acceleration he craved in finding new young male victims. Consequently, to Chris, she was as important as prey as any of the boys.

In fact, I think there were times that most of us thought she was going to never live to the next scene. But, as much as her presence annoyed him, he was too smart to allow himself to succumb to his desires of violence for her. She was too valuable to his grand scheme. You thought he was going to kill her in the heat of passion, but you were supposed to think that. This is why I give this film more credit than most.

The fact is, Chris had no more long term interest in Aurole than I do for Phyllis Diller. It was only the young victims that could satiate his desires, and he needed to make sure his supply continued. Doing it alone was becoming nearly overwhelming. After his difficult kill at the beginning of the movie one could actually see his exact light bulb moment that he decided it could not continue like this. His first gaze into Aurore eyes - or more aptly her mesmerized, deer in the headlight gaze back - was the moment that the spider started secreting webbing and visualizing every intricacy of his mental blueprint. The web construction began.

It was a transformative moment where he went from being seen as mostly disturbed to being seen as an antithesis of evil.

If it escaped you that he used his beauty to convert her and shape the world he lived in, then I contend you missed a major character point and probably the number one plot point.

We may not be used to seeing a male pretending to be the vulnerable, sexy and beautiful ""blonde"" in films, but I think Chris's character represented the stereotypical large chested, cutie girl that controls the wills of powerful and wealthy men.. Chris was completely self-aware of his eye candy value and exploited it at every opportunity (whether with Aurole or seducing his next victim).

I saw Chris as much smarter than nearly every other character. I certainly found him to be more likable than the rest - all of whom seemed to be stuck in a banal and boring life.
Was he more sad and pathetic than those around him? Perhaps.
Was he smarter than everyone else? Most definitely!

This element of conscious, master manipulator made this film much deeper in my opinion than a slash film that is full of violence only for the sake of violence. It probably helps that I have a ""thing"" for the French, because I found myself ready to violently dispense with Aurore if she dared to turn him in.

Yes, this film drew me in completely. It has been on my list of favorites that I watch more than once. In 5 or 6 viewings I have not regained my moral compass. If anything, I find Chris more sympathetic and appealing with each view.

Hmm. Maybe you should call for a net!

5055095,1,B0074NDNJ6,This should not be in the gay film category.  Should be in thrillers.  This is about a straight male who has lots of sex with his girlfriend.  And shows female nudity.

See forget yourself and see if you don't agree. The ending is appropriate but yet it pulls at your heart strings.

5055100,2,B0074NDNJ6,If you need a movie to put you to sleep then this will be the one for watching. IT appears to be predictable and annoying at times while following the story line. It started out slow and just could not pick up enough speed for me. I compare it to a bad version of American Psycho but even AP had more action than this dud.

5055106,5,B0074NDNJ6,"Not your average cup of tea here in Amerioa.  This French film has more in common with American Psycho than Psycho if you're going for a literal American Translation.  The young stars are mesmerizing and totally beautiful eye candy in the process.  Be warned the French have no problem with full frontal nudity and in the case of Pierre Perrier's lap dance sequence (seducing and dominating yet vaguely submitting to his girlfriend in one of the movies most erotic and disturbing scenes)indicates they have no problem with full male arousal as well.  The movie is hard to peg but suffice it to say the girl falls for the boy who also likes guys and (as a little kicker that would destroy most relationships) unlike his hetero bent...he prefers to kill his male hustler tricks in the bargain.  It's a road trip movie as only the French could imagine it and certainly it is full of meanings and shifting shadows that you garner at your own level of maturity and insight.  It's the modern equivalent of the movies Alain Delon and Gerard Depardieu did in the sixties and eighties respectively stretching the envelope of French Cinema (and world cinema for that matter).  I am not familiar with this Director's work (Pascal Arnold in collaboration with Jean-Marc Barr, cinematographer and editor) but am highly intrigued now by this dark blooded take on love and sex and modern morality of serial killers in pursuit of themselves and escaping themselves (and remarkably with zero blood or gore on screen).  Perrier is certainly an actor to take note of in his male/female nubile and nebulous embodiment of the wounded loner ready to take a mate and to share his psychic wasteland (and the actor's willingness to do just that). He hits his notes perfectly and interprets the music he is playing masterfully for such a young man.  His eyes hold you like no other I've seen in years on the screen and you can almost (but not quite) understand the girl's almost Svengali attachment. The girl is played by Lizzie Brochere (playing the American) who certainly holds her own both as eye candy and against Perrier's performance and by balancing her character's subjectivity allows him to achieve his performance while defining her own aggressive passivity and is not redundant(again a remarkable acting achievement for one so young).  It speaks to modern society's detachment on the human level.  This is subjective art of the first order...so for me to try to explain it to you further would be an exercise in my own vanity.  It would be a greater sin to give away more of the plot or the ending. The movie was so controversial abroad that there is a Directors' comment included on the disk. See it yourself and judge if you like or dislike where the envelope bursts in on your own particular sense of self and loss.  I did not find it to be disjointed or incoherent as others have said, in fact just the opposite and I came away profoundly disturbed by my ability to connect with both these characters.  French Cinema at its best speaks to the human condition and this one succeeds magnificently on a visceral level.",1381449600,9,3105,4.757914338919925
