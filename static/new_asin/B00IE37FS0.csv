There's also a challenge in adapting the original material, which essentially involves a loving father giving up his daughter to a monster to save his own skin, and a young girl being wooed by a terrifying beast who emotionally black-mails her into staying with him by insisting that he'll die without her.

How to make this material palatable to a modern audience? Director Christophe Gans's secret weapon is actress La Seydoux, who plays Belle not as an attractive doormat succumbing to Stockholm Syndrome, but a young woman who uses her guile, intelligence and beauty to get the upper hand over her beastly jailer. Far from being a love story, the courtship period between these two plays out more like a battle of wills, in which power continually tips back and forth between the lovely Belle and the brutish Beast (Vincent Cassel).

But I've gotten a little ahead of myself.  The film is initially quite faithful to Jeanne-Marie de Beaumont's original fairy tale (first published in 1756), by introducing a merchant and his six children (three boys, three girls) who have lost their fortune and been forced to relocate to a country cottage. After getting lost in the forest, the merchant stumbles across a crumbling and seemingly deserted palace filled with food, wine and treasure.

Before leaving the next morning he plucks a rose in the garden for his daughter Belle, and with this act a terrible Beast appears, demanding to know why his hospitality has been repaid with thievery. The Beast proposes a deal: if one of the merchant's children is willing to take his place at the castle, he will forgive the transgression. Naturally, it is Belle who decides to sacrifice herself, sneaking out of the cottage one morning to travel to the Beast's castle.

At this point the film strays from the traditional format of the fairy tale, adding plenty of subplots that are unique to this particularly retelling. Belle is guided around the palace by a mysterious cloud of golden mist that occasionally transforms into a deer, revealing the Beast's backstory and the sequence of events that led to him being transformed into a monster (I won't give away any details, but it's very much like something out of Greek mythology). Furthermore, one of Belle's older brothers is a gambler, and heavily indebted to a dangerous crook called Perducas. The film's final act involves Perducas, his thugs, and his fortune-teller girlfriend Astrid storming the beast's castle in search of treasure, only to be menaced by stone giants that the Beast conjures to life.

Unfortunately, these subplots threaten to overshadow what should be the crux of any Beauty and the Beast retelling - the love story. As it is, we're never given a clear idea why exactly this headstrong Belle should even *like* let alone fall in love with the demanding and temperamental Beast (unlike the Disney film, his behavior never really improves over the course of the film), to the point where her declaration of love feels as though it comes out of nowhere.

But the finished product looks beautiful, from the wintry forest that surrounds the perpetual summer of the Beast's garden, to the jewel-like tones of Belle's gowns as she explores the ruined opulence of the castle, to the simple image of a red rose lying on a pure white handkerchief. Only the presence of several CGI beagles, warped into what look like grotesque bobble-heads, is a strain of whimsy that looks completely out of place.

Its undeniable beauty is reason enough to see ""La Belle et la Bete"" at least once, as is La Seydoux's performance as a Beauty that has teeth and claws of her own. Vincent Cassel is a little shortchanged, hidden as he is behind CGI ""make-up"" and a lack of substantial character development, though there's a nice twist on expectations in regards to where he and Belle end up living.

A word of warning though: this is a French film and the product information does not fully clarify whether or not there are English subtitles. Make sure you check and double check before making a purchase.",1415404800,13,4637,5.306539509536785
6260041,5,B00IE37FS0,Ever since I saw the trailer for this I fell in love!  The scenery is so breath taking and the story line is interesting.  Sadly I don't understand French!  I hope they release a version that has English subtitles.,1414108800,8,214,4.435897435897436

6260043,5,B00IE37FS0,"This is such a beautiful retelling, absolutely captivating. It's not a Disney type account, rather a grown up, intense version where the chemistry instantly jumps off the screen. It's so odd to describe such between the beast and Belle but from the moment they meet, there's this chemistry that's chilling. I completely fell in love with the Beast before the halfway point, they just did such a great job in showing the man underneath the face. Vincent Cassel was perfect for this role, but Lea Seydoux shines as Belle with her abstract type beauty that makes her such a stand out, her character being meek and courageous. I saw this online and absolutely will search to buy this DVD. Interesting, grown up romantic retelling of a classic tale. Perfect casting, superb acting, highly recommend!",1412380800,13,794,4.932835820895522

I hope the DVD will come out with Subtitles too. For us who doesn't understand French, but need English Subtitles, and of course another language subtitles too. Hope that other will be amazed with this film. Of course I give it a five stars. But I will not buy the DVD if there are no Subtitles at all. Sorry. Chow.",1410307200,11,482,4.193548387096774

I found this movie online, and it was not going to be released in US theaters, and then I just happened upon a Region 1 DVD with English Subtitles (I mean, I can speak some French but not everything) and this movie was beyond enjoyable for me. My mom & I had to watch it two days in a row after I received it in the mail. Such a luxurious, lush telling of Beauty & The Beast, and the Costume and Bling are amazing!",1429833600,5,431,3.9655172413793105

I saw this on a plane over the Pacific during the summer and have visited this site every few weeks since looking for an English subtitle version and here it is.

It's like every single small detail of this film was carefully thought out...I'm telling you, the people who worked to make this movie what is are a team of perfectionists. I feel so lucky to have seen this movie, and I've never said that about a movie before. I know that we have a ""Beauty And The Beast"" being made for the US, but I can assure you that the level of beauty will not compare. In American films they always blur out the lovely details in the background, this film lets you get lost in it's glory!

6260052,5,B00IE37FS0,"Wow, this movie is so beautiful in every way including the story and the amazing cinematography. The actors are all perfect for their respective roles.  This movie is a MUST HAVE for any fan of fairy tales and love stories, and if you are such a fan then youll have to get this movie as an import.  You can get it right here through a third party seller, or get it from Amazon themselves at http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00QSO7VD6 . The DVD is the original French movie, but with English subtitles and plays on USA DVD players. BUT BEFORE YOU BUY THE DVD OR BLU-RAY make sure to check that it is Region 1, and check the language is French and that the subtitles are in English.  This movie is age appropriate for anyone who is 18 and older.  There is no bad language but there is one very tiny tiny scene where there is very minor nudity.  Anyways, I love this movie very much and it is nothing like the one made by Disney.  This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again.  And because they did such an outstanding job of this movie, I just wanted more and more of this movie  in other words I didn't want this movie to end, and that is rare for me to say.",1426723200,26,1169,4.1875

6260054,3,B00IE37FS0,"The film is an attempt to create a contemporary version of Jean Cocteau's ""la Belle et le Bete"".  An unparalleled Masterpiece from 1946 by one of the greatest minds in film ever, Jean Cocteau.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Belle-B%C3%AAte-Jean-Marais/dp/B00DSKW95S/ref=sr_1_4?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1422803590&sr=1-4&keywords=La+Belle+et+la+B%C3%AAte+jean+cocteau

This version is just ok because it tries too hard to be something in between that masterpiece and Disney with those ewok creatures in the beginning.

There is an enormous amount of CGI in this version while Jean Cocteau in 1946 created truly outstanding magical special effects with nothing less than the work of brilliant artistry and the enchanted camera. Sheer genius is an understatement for his work.  Meanwhile, back to  Christophe Gans version.  I'm not sure what he was thinking when he made this with his 33 million euro budget but, it has not done well because he took-on a great project with infinite potential and tried too hard to blend the 2 genre's together.  This attempt makes things confusing to audiences and in turn becomes a failure. Is it a new version? ""no"" is it a Pixar or Disney version? ""no"", is it an intellectual art film version ""no""?  it's a mish mash and a skilled filmmaker knows his medium and unfortunately Christophe Gans falls short here, his inherent instincts failed him.  Anyway, worth a watch if you speak fluent French or can withstand the horrible computer generated English Subtitles they so negligently slapped on.",1422748800,2,1513,5.487068965517241

Although the Blu-ray disk is indeed ""all regions compatible,"" as indicated in the description, be aware however that this doesn't necessarily means it will play on your Blu-ray player.  One potential issue, here, is that the disk content is 50Hz (i.e. 50i/50p), which means 1080/50i, containing either 50i interlaced content or 25p progressive content. While all Europeans Blu-ray players are compatible with that format, such is not always necessarily the case for all American players.

US Blu-ray Players NOT compatible with 50Hz content, include, among many others:

- Panasonic DMP-BD30 with firmware 1.6 or later
- Panasonic DMP-BD35
- Panasonic DMP-BD55
- Panasonic DMP-BD70V
- Panasonic DMP-BDT110
- Panasonic DMP-BDT210 [using standard firmware]
- Sony BDP-S350
- Sony BDP-S370
- Sony BDP-S550
- Sony BDP-S560
- Sony BDP-S570
- Sony Playstation 3

So do your research, and make sure your player is compatible with 50Hz content.

Note: For the Game Console owners among you, the Sony Playsation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One (outputs 50Hz content at 60Hz) both are compatible.",1484352000,8,1251,5.960893854748603
