8703658,4,B00U06CNMC,"We are on Season 3.  For the most part it played fine but one of the discs in Season 1 stopped and started and 1 episode in Season 3, disc skipped all over the place. I tried cleaning it, still stop and go. I got so aggravated, I went to the next episode so I missed some parts. I don't think this should be happening.",1439769600,,318,3.8923076923076922

8703662,5,B00U06CNMC,"The sons of Anarchy is the most addicting program I have ever watched! I just wish the series would have lasted 10 or 12 seasons. I was not ready for the season to end. My husband and I are looking for a new series to watch, but we are finding it difficult to find one that comes close to Sons of Anarchy! Someday down the road we will watch it again....but until then we will keep looking for something to keep us as entertained!",1433894400,2,430,4.130952380952381
