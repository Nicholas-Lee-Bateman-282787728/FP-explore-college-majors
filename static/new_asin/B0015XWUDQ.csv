8260465,5,B0015XWUDQ,"I've watched only two cartoons so far, so will leave the reviews to other posters.  I did want to mention the existence of an alternate Betty Boop lunchbox, which I bought tonight at a local discount store.  See my pictures above.  It contains the same two Betty Boop DVD's but no case for permanently storing them, and no keychain.  It includes four additional ""TV Cartoon Classics"" DVD's (two single-sided disks and one double-sided disk).  Sadly, these don't include the two PD Betty Boop cartoons missing from the main set, ""On With the New"" and ""Whoops! I'm a Cowboy"".  I don't know if anyone on Amazon is selling this version, but if you see one in a B&M store that mentions ""TV Cartoon Classics"" on the back panel, keep in mind it's not the same as what's listed here.",1333670400,4,775,4.579710144927536
