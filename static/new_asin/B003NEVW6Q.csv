SCARLET FRY is the `host with the most' I was a fan of this Icon since Don Dohler's CINEMAGIC Magazine in the '80s.

4157538,5,B003NEVW6Q,"First there was HORROR-RAMA, then there was JUNKFOOD HORROR FEST, now comes director Walter Ruethers most accomplished film, Scarlet Fry's NIGHTMARE ALLEY. This low budget indie horror anthology is the latest (and I hope not last) film from Arizona based Pretorius Productions. The stories range from the humourous, to the bloody, to the entirely innapropriate. This is a movie for the whole family...that is if you're refering to The Manson Family. Shot on a low budget and on video, the film manages to maintain a higher degree of professionalism and quality than most shot on video crap out there. The film is well paced, entertaining and displays a large dose of Ruethers unique brand of black humor. The whole film also stands as an affectionate tribute to the bygone, and some fans will say far superior, era of the grindhouse horror film.  An era that produced many of Hollywoods biggest contempory directors, whoose first films were low budget horror gems (Wes Craven, George Romero Ect.), and influenced a score of other current Hollywood names. (Tarantino, Rob Zombie Ect.)

The stand out segment, amongst 7 tasty tidbit of terror, is called ""Rebellion"" in which and evil toy rat posses a man and makes him kill so that the rat may feed on souls untill he gets big enough to take over the world. Notable also is the segment entitled ""Meat"" which is a great blend of canibalisim, murder and innapropriate baby oil rubdowns. A personal favorite however was ""Death Chat"" which was a blackly comedic argument against on-line hook ups. It's obvious to me that Ruether and his Pretorius Productions have as much talent if not more, that alot of who is running modern Hollywood. They also have a genuine love for horror films (Which is evidanced in the name of the company, Pretorious, a character referance to the 1935 classic Bride of Frankenstein.) and film-making in general. In this digitally soul-less time of big budget 3D garbage like the films of James Cameron and George Lucas, it's refreshing to see an indie film with such promise produced by people with soul. I for one would love to see what Reuther and Pretorius could do with 1/8th of Avatar's budget.",1275264000,,2170,4.878048780487805
8401013,5,B003NEVW6Q,"This movie is one that should be kept in a vault for safe keeping. The first time I saw this was on netflix when my husband was trying to annoy me with b-rate movies. It was so bad it captured eyes and we sat and watched the whole thing and laughed at this god awful garbage. We couldn't help ourselves and watched it over and over again for months to put ourselves in a good mood until it was removed and we were forced to hunt down a copy on dvd. It was harder than you might think. This is now one of our all time favorite films and we could never imagine our lives with out it. Do yourselve's a favor and sit through horrendous piece of crap and it will grow on you to. After this movie I don't think I will ever read comic books in an alley near homeless people again. Yeah its that scary :P

P.S. I'll have whatever you're having",1374969600,2,835,4.030120481927711

8401015,4,B003NEVW6Q,"If you liked ""Tales from the Crypt""-style macabre humor mixed with a little gore, and enjoy low/no-budget guerrilla-style production values, then do yourself a favor and check out ""Nightmare Alley.""",1344384000,2,198,5.633333333333334
8401016,5,B003NEVW6Q,"Lots of mixed reviews on this film so I thought I would take it for a drive and see how it handled. Very low budget bud as you watch it you begin to get sucked into the camp. This would have been the type of film I would have rented over and over again in my youth. Very old school style with devil rats to zombie cowboys. Fun, weird, and very very nostalgic. Watched on Netflix V.O.D but now I'm gonna order it!!!",1301529600,,414,4.0
8401017,4,B003NEVW6Q,a hip and groovey horror twister with some really funny tales. appeals to the punk/chic audience and has some jolting moments that catch you off guard. scarlet fry has a really sick sense of humor!,1291161600,,197,4.6571428571428575
8401018,4,B003NEVW6Q,"Nightmare Alley is a fast-paced series of short gross-out horror-comedies hosted by Scarlet Fry.  It will remind you of Creepshow in its storytelling style, but really it's more like being at Tromadance (for those of us who have been lucky enough to attend this wild and wacky film festival).  The stories (mostly written by co-director Walter Ruether) are all quite different in themes and styles; exploring everything from zombies to psychotic killers in seven short movies filled with sarcastic humor, cheesy performances and over-the-top gore.  Don't expect a bunch of depressing grueling horror here - Most of these tales have as much humor as horror.  Watch it like it's a film festival with some low-budget horror loving friends and you'll have a good time!",1290211200,2,764,5.137096774193548
8401019,5,B003NEVW6Q,There isn't much I can add to the other reviews except I am surprised no one has mentioned the great music in this video.  Easy to get lost in the gore and campy humor but watch it again sportsfans.  Scarlet Fry just keeps getting better so keep them coming!,1287360000,,258,4.244897959183674
8401020,2,B003NEVW6Q,"Horror host Scarlet Fry presents this blood-splattered omnibus feature that flows from the same vein as the classic EC Comics of the 1940's and 50's. The film is broken into seven 10-minute vignettes, with each story being more gruesome and less interesting than the last. A Fistfull of Innards  has a greedy outlaw gored by his two undead partners after killing them over a golden meteor. Zeke must kidnap and kill hot young teens in order to appease the evil Mexican Hell Rat which has possessed his soul in Rebellion. In Death Chat, a cheating husband gets what he axed for when he meets up with a stranger he met online for a casual encounter. A tubby neighbor is invited over for a special dinner after the sexy girl upstairs murders her jealous husband in Meat. Waiting for the bus was never seemed so bad until a punk rocker brutally kills a gay admirer before stealing his porn in Closet Case. Next, a failing artist finds inspiration in his dead wife's carcass after shutting her up with a knife in The Great Damone. Finally, Jack the Ripper is back to kill again when a traveling exhibit stops into town in Slash of the Blade. Each of the shorts bear some resemblance to more successful films, but despite all of the bad acting and amateur filmmaking, NIGHTMARE ALLEY is actually a fun watch with several gooey instances of low-buget gore. A grainy overlay is used to give the film a vintage look and feel that does a good job at masking the hand-held camerawork. The poorly-framed stories are typically shaped around a single centerpiece of splatter, but lack any proper structure or true irony. Scarlet Fry's third feature film is better than it rightfully deserves to be, and is sure to appeal to the hard Gore fanbase.

8401022,4,B003NEVW6Q,"""Nightmare Alley"" is a 7 part anthology horror film from writers / directors Laurence Holloway and Walter Ruether.  This low budget effort gets off to a good start with an opening of a Bum offering a comic book for a smoke to two long hair's who make the mistake of insulting the bum who promptly pulls a knife and takes one of them out.  The other freind leaves his buddy stranded and the victim's response to this betrayal is Classic.  This sort of humor is present throughout ""Nightmare Alley""  and is really the film makers saying ""have fun"" with this.  Taken in this intended tongue in cheek manor the alley delivers a good time to horror fans.  The first story ""A Fistful of Inards"" is a zombie opus with a cowboy twist which is quite unique.  Great gore effects make this one a real treat.  ""Rebellion"" about a satanic rat that wants to take over the world may have the best humor and dialogue in the film and is a hoot!  ""Death Chat""  features the best atmosphere of all the stories including an axe to the head that is excellent.  The vengeful spirit and her appearance is quite effective as well.  ""Meat"" has some sick ideas in it, and ""The Great Damone"" was a nice change of pace from the other stories.  The film ends strong with the most suspensful tale of them all called ""Slash of the Blade"" which is a Jack the Ripper story that manages some nice slasher moments and a few gory set pieces that will please most gore fans.  ""Closet Case"" was the only true let down of the 7 stories and doesn't seem to belong with the other stories.  Overall Holloway and Ruether make up for the lack of budget with their love of horror movies.  By no means a classic, but taken the way it is intended ""Nightmare Alley"" is a good time for horror fans and should please the independent horror film fan a lot.  Pick it up!",1281484800,2,1818,4.363095238095238
