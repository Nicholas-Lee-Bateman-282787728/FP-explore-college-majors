7869453,5,6304288018,I had this video when I was teaching and loved it.  The students enjoyed it and it was great way to introduce how things were and how things have changed.  This will be a gift to my son-in-law for his classroom as we have shared it and it was a great way to discuss changes.,1376956800,,274,3.963636363636364

But $99?",1166832000,,211,4.861111111111111
7869455,5,6304288018,"A fantastic insight into the history of merchandising in America. I love historic documentaries, but the fam isn't into them, however, *everyone* gathered round the TV to watch ""Mr. Sears Catalogue"".

Very  interesting, packed with lots of great information and highly entertaining.

If you're a history buff, you'll probably watch it over and over again  like I did.

This video is full of great pictures and images from the  very early 1900's. I thought I knew a great deal about that time period in  American history, but this video taught me a great deal more!
