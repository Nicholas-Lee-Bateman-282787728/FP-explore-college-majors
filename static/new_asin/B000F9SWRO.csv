2555785,5,B000F9SWRO,"This is dfinitely the best of the series, including the pilot episode, which is among others one of my favourites. By far one of the most favourite cartoons of the 80's. I hope some day, they will release the entire series. Funs of Saber Rider should absolutely watch this! I enjoyed it very much!!!",1178582400,,299,4.555555555555555
2555786,1,B000F9SWRO,"I had very fond childhood memories of Saber Rider, so I was excited to find this dvd. Unfortunately, watching it again as an adult, I find that it's really bad. Really, really bad. It doesn't help that I've been watching Starblazers, another childhood favorite, since there's no comparison in terms of animation, plotting, and overall quality.

I'm pretty sure this is a cartoon ONLY a child can love.",1161043200,2,401,4.897058823529412
2555787,5,B000F9SWRO,"I loved this show when I was little and have been looking on and off for something like this for the past 10+ years.  Literally, the only thing I could find was an mp3 of the theme song and the occasional video on Ebay (I was only able to get one).

Cowboys in space...if there's anything better than that, I'd like to know!  That Saber Rider...mmm...one of the first characters I fell in love with as a kid, along with Cary Elwes in the Princess Bride and Tom Cruise in Legend.

The only thing that I have to complain about is that the way the DVD was presented was very very cheap.  The cover insert just looks like a cheap colour photocopy in a cheap case.  In fact, if I hadn't purchased it on Amazon, I would have been completely convinced that it was a fake copy.  It's sad that World Events decided to cheap out on something like that.

It's disappointing that World Events only came out with only 10 episodes instead of the whole series (there were only 52 episodes after all).  Let's hope that World Events comes out with all the episodes of this wonderful cartoon!",1151280000,8,1074,4.35678391959799
2555788,5,B000F9SWRO,"Though I purchased this directly from World Events Productions, I was very delighted with this 2-disc DVD set.

This set has 10 episodes (5 on disc 1, 5 on disc 2). The picture and sound are pretty good.

As a fan of ""Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs"", I have to recommend this to other fans. World Events is (hopefully) prepping another DVD set of ""Saber Rider"" in the near future.

This legend is back!",1145318400,10,405,4.373333333333333

8119376,3,B000F9SWRO,"Item was defective, cause could not be determined
The cardboard box was fine just the DVD cover is in the middle of heavily kinked. The German post office assumes no liability and to search for the cause in the United States would be too costly. The contents of the DVD is okay in itself, but because I have to leave in the original packaging, as it is a collector's item, I was able to test you on, because they probably German player does not work anyway.",1328400000,,457,4.325581395348837

8119378,5,B000F9SWRO,"I must say, this is way overdue. Someone must really like me, to think of releasing this series. Saber Rider was my favourite cartoon series growing up, along with He-man and Shera. Transformers is also a favourite. I hope they get to release the entire series on dvd. I can't remember how many seasons it had, but I know that this is way cool! I have watched them over and over again, and I can't get enough. Looknig forward to the rest of the series. I have the previous one ""The 10 Best Episodes, so I had to have this one too. The action never ends with Saber Rider and the Star Sherrifs, and who can forget the transformation of Ramrod, into a giant robot! I highly recommend this to any fan! Long live Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs!",1234310400,,742,4.307142857142857
8119379,5,B000F9SWRO,I was very pleased with the dvd collection. I have been trying to find the collection for some time now and was glad when Amazon finally had it. I'm looking forward to the next volume of Saber Rider to come out.,1231200000,,211,4.170731707317073
8119380,4,B000F9SWRO,"I remember watching this show as a kid. When I heard it was coming out on DVD i decided to purchase it. Now I am not a big DVD collector and can probably count on one hand how many DVD i have purchased in the past six months. For those who don't know Saber Rider was over shadow by its more popular cousin Voltron and was lost in the Transformers popularity what show wasn't. Even when I told my buddy he couldn't remember this show. The moment I played the them song it came back to him. Its sort of a Voltron meets Bravestarr. I enjoyed watching the the two disk set. If you enjoy 80's cartoons or anything nostalgic I suggest you buy this.

Now on the Dvd itself. Box art and DVD art are nothing spectacular. Menus are some what cool. I haven't checked out the extras in Disc One. Disc two has the main (hero) character profiles and their theme music. Kind of one of those things well we need an Extra lets throw that in would be quick and easy.  There are some minor glitches in the episodes. These include minor color and one point minor patches. Also in one episode the audio sync is so out of whack its almost hilarious. It some hows get out of sync when there is a very minor hiccup on that episode. Still these very minor glitches and shouldn't distract you from viewing or purchasing this set. Like all Tv shows there are so-so episodes, mediocre and good episodes. I recommend you purchasing this 2 Disc Set and I am looking forward to the second installment.  Head 'em up, move 'em out...Thanks VCI for making this one.",1229385600,,1531,4.309027777777778
8119381,4,B000F9SWRO,"The packaging here consists of a standard black dvd case with a hinged flip-page to hold the second disc.  The cover has reflective foil printing.  Clipped inside the case is a folded two-page insert listing the volume's episodes with brief synopses.  Both dvds  (lazily) recycle the same silvery image for their disc labels: 8 episodes on the first disc, 9 on the other.

The dvds have animated menus sporting a mechanical theme -- sliding panels, rotating gears, HUD cockpit graphics, and a silhouetted robotic armature which highlights any menu selections.  The series' intro song plays over the main menu, while unrelated commercial music is used for other parts of the discs, such as during the gallery bonus feature -- electronica pop, presumably in keeping with the robotic theme, advertised as ""I, Computer"" by a band called RadioRadio who are seemingly hoping to be confused with ""OK Computer"" by Radiohead.

The contained extras are spread over both discs:
1a. An extensive image gallery presenting character and vehicle design sheets for the entire series, including a large assortment of incidental characters like generic cowboy villains and New Frontier townsfolk.
1b. A few commercials for a 1987 ""Saber Rider sweepstakes"" mail-in contest (from which the original contest mailing info has been blanked out).
2. Character profiles (heroes and Ramrod only) with descriptive text, each played to their particular leitmotif music from the soundtrack CD (which mostly motivates me to go purchase the CD since these sample tracks sound absolutely great).  Strangely, the profile included for Saber Rider is the only one written in past tense, making it read like an obituary: ""He was a young man..."" rather than more correctly reading, ""Although a young man, he is referred to as 'legendary' due to..."" etc.; even his horse is referenced in bygone tense -- RIP to both, I suppose. :p

Dolby stereo sound, excluding episodes 1-4 and 11, which are mono.  English only.  No subtitle option available.  Image quality appears okay at a quick inspection, with a tiny printed notice on the back sleeve indicating the presence of digital restoration work, but it varies somewhat, showing the beginnings of aging in places.
Quality-control problems: Episode 11, ""Oh Boy! Dinosaurs!"", seems to have escaped any remastering attention, with its aforementioned monaural audio and a noticably inferior picture throughout, showing washed-out color and poor contrast compared to all other disc content; it's also missing its superimposed title card.  Episode 3, ""Jessie's Revenge"" is likewise missing its title, and the opening line of recap narration is barely audible.  [For any curious fans,  ""Oh Boy! Dinosaurs!"" is scripted by Marc Handler & Susan Myers, while ""Jessie's Revenge"" is by Marc Handler.]

The episode bumper segments have all been edited out, unfortunately.  They were always just the same brief bit of footage with Saber on his mecha-horse swinging his sword down over the show logo, but the accompanying voiceovers were often tailored to each episode, such as referencing the story events immediately preceding the commercial breaks, or being delivered by minor characters particular to that episode (eg., Gattler, Jessie, Trista, King Jaray, Snowcone) which often added to the entertainment value by catching the viewer off guard; or humourously 'breaking the fourth wall' with mangled variations, like a gruff-voiced villain asserting, ""Now back to the Desperadoes and the Sheriffs!""

Another minor complaint is that the episodes are split into wholly packaged units, meaning the Prev/Next button on your remote won't let you hop over the opening sequence, navigate through episodes by acts, or skip ahead directly to the closing credits -- you're forced to fast forward.

I haven't watched through all the episodes yet, already very familiar with the show from my old VHS recordings.  This series animates gritty explosions with flying debris like nobody's business, and Dale Schacker's outstanding music score still sounds very contemporary.  The scripting nicely balances action scenes with romance and wry touches of humour, even throwing in bits of philosophy for genuine character development.  The middle episodes play mostly as stand-alone pieces, whereas the latter half of the series adopts more multi-part storytelling in strongly sequential episodes.

Some of WEP's blatant kid-softening of tone for the Western translation is funny: everything blown up is claimed in dialogue to be abandoned or piloted robotically, reassuring viewers that no one was hurt even when the visuals suggest otherwise. Or dialogue straining to mollify more sinister motives, like readily apparent theft -- the nervously detouring truckers in ""Brawlin' Is My Callin'"" instead claiming to ""take a shortcut"" -- or the lethal consequences of gunshots instead reduced to ""stun gun"" victims who have supposedly merely fallen unconscious.  It would be nice if the bonus features could include some sample clips from the original Japanese ""Star Musketeer Bismarck"" anime for comparison.

Favorite episodes found on this volume: ""Four Leaf Clover"", ""Wild Horses Couldn't Drag Me Away"", ""What Did You Do On Your Summer Vacation"", ""Star Sheriff Round-up""; sharply animated action sequences are also seen in ""Iguana Get To Know You"" and ""Jessie Blue"".  Best episodes in the forthcoming second volume, in my opinion: ""All-Galaxy Grand Prix"", ""Snow Blind"", ""Sharpshooter"", and ""Gattler's Last Stand"".  Volume three should feature the coolest episode in the series, ""Jessie's Girl"" (he's so cruel!), plus the slickest angularly stylized Japanese animation belonging to the penultimate episode, ""Who Is Nemesis?""",1227398400,7,5702,5.428086070215175

8119383,4,B000F9SWRO,"The 1980s are considered a unique time for animation and as children of that generation (myself included) grow older, we find ourselves on an endless quest to relive the memories of our youth.  Thanks to the technology of DVD, companies are making this nostalgia as simple as slipping a disc into the player.  Enter Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs, a unique animated saga that ran from 1986 to 1989 across 52 episodes.  Oddly, despite being a loyal fan of Voltron and Robotech, I myself somehow missed this one in its original broadcast debut.  The good news is that World Events Productions (WEP) hasn't forgotten their hordes of Saber Rider fans and released a 2 disc compilation (back in April of 2006) featuring 10 of the most classic episodes of the show's run.

The program was originally developed by the creators of Voltron and it bears an uncanny resemblance to its sister-series in terms of animation quality, visual effects, and even voice acting/ sound score.  What is most interesting is that like Voltron and Robotech, the source material came from a long-running Japanese series (which was oddly titled Star Musketeer Bismark).  WEP purchased rights to the show in 1986 and rewrote/ revised the source material for a stateside release.  So Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs was born to compete with popular western-themed shows of the time such as Filmation's Bravestarr and Gaylord Entertainment Company's The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers.

The nuts and bolts of Saber Rider are actually pretty unique in the grand scheme of things.  Although the environments and style may have been wild-westerly inspired, the core of the material was actually closer to the wildly popular robotic theme of the era (think Transformers, Gobots, Voltron, Robotech, etc.)  In fact the similarities to Voltron go well beyond the appearance of the series as the show's hook centered on our human heroes piloting a massive high-tech vehicle capable of transforming into a 250 feet tall attack robot named RamRod (voiced by none other than Peter Cullen who you might remember as Optimus Prime in the 1980s Transformers cartoons).  Once activated, RamRod would be thrust into robotic combat with an evil giant-robot equivalent known as a Desperado Unit (again keeping with the western spin).

Aside from the robotic influence of the program, we are at the core, following the exploits of a human cast who pilot the vehicle/ robot.  Among these are the British Saber Rider himself (who travels on a robotic steed), a young racecar driver named Fireball, a bounty hunter named Colt, and a chipper heroine named April (who happens to be daughter of Commander Eagle, the engineer responsible for heading up the RamRod project).

 Combined these individuals form the Star Sheriffs and their mission is to protect mankind from the evil Outriders, a race of human-like aliens who have the ability to cross over from another dimension known as the Vapor Zone.

The ten shows collected for this compilation basically were chosen from the 52-episode roster as they represent a beginning, middle, and ending sample of the series as a whole.  Sure there were many side-adventures and interesting plotlines along the way, WEP feels that this 2 disc set will summarizie the spirit of the original show quite effectively.

Included are the following ten episodes:

Disc 1

Star Sheriff Roundup
Sole Survivor
Famous Last Words
Sharpshooter
The Monarch Supreme

Disc 2

Cavalry Command
Jesse's Revenge
Jesse Blue
Bad Day at Dry Gulch
Happy Trails

Additionally, WEP includes a host of interesting bonus material that is located on the first disc by accesssing the special features menu. Among these are some uncut clips of the Japanese incarnation of the show (Bismark) and an image gallery of original production art.  They even include a commerical from the 1980s in which viewers could enter to win one in over a million Saber Rider prizes. Very cool!

About the only complaint I've heard from collectors is that they wish WEP would release the show in its entirety across several collections (similar to what has been done with the Voltron franchise).  In the mean time, the Best of Saber Rider and the Star Sherrifs is quite a tasty treat so filled with flavor of the era that even I felt nostalgia when viewing it and I never caught the show in its broadcast debut!",1203033600,2,4353,4.98478561549101
8119384,2,B000F9SWRO,"I was ecstatic to find this DVD, because SRatSS has a special place in my heart, a childhood favorite.

The picture and sound quality are both great. It's the EPISODES featured that make me see red.

Top Ten fan selected episodes... WHO are these fans, and WHAT are they on???????

Yes, a few are good. Star Sheriff Roundup, Cavalry Command, and Happy Trails are classic eps, three key points of the SRatSS series.

But the other seven episodes? Pure filler, non-relevent. What about the other pivotal episodes? When Commander Eagle is rescued from the Outriders. When Fireball has a near-death crash, loses his memory, and has visions of his heroic father. When Vanquo is well and truly defeated. I'll throw in, just for fun, the cow that attacked Fireball's car when it heard the sound of that horrid horn, and Colt's hilarious teasing afterwards.

If you're a true-to-the-heart fan, don't buy this collection. It'll only disappoint you.",1198540800,2,939,4.955414012738854
