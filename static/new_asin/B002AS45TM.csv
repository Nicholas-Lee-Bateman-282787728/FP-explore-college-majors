3891373,1,B002AS45TM,"This movie is very misleadingly titled.  There is no, ZERO, exploration of ""Vietnam in Kennedy had lived"" here.  It's a standard documentary breezing through three years of history in a very cursory manner, adding no new insights and just barely touching on the tumultuous events of Kennedy's presidency.  At the end the narrator says ""Of course, Kennedy might have done things differently.""  Really?  That's it?  That's your whole counterfactual analysis?  If you don't want to explore a historical ""what if,"" then call your movie something else next time!!",1360022400,3,558,5.2727272727272725
3891374,5,B002AS45TM,Provided so much more of what was going on in the world during his presidency instead of just the Bay of Pigs and the Cuba conflict. How one misguided judgemental call here would have a different outcome in other parts of the world.,1354060800,,232,4.4186046511627906
3891375,5,B002AS45TM,"This is a great documentary and tells of how JFK prevented war on multiple occasions - in Cuba during Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile crisis, in Laos, in Vietnam in 1961, in Berlin, and withdrawing troops from Vietnam. Then LBJ took over and he was a different type of president. He wasn't the skeptic Kennedy was. He firmly believed that Vietnam could be won, a very costly mistake for America. If JFK had been in office, he would have most likely have negotiated or withdrawn, just like he did in hte case of Laos/Cuba.

If only presidents today were like JFK - President Bush reminds me of LBJ, he went to war in Afghanistan over an attack on the U.S, but then forayed into Iraq, which had nothing to do with the attack. JFK would never had done such a thing. The Iraq War costed billions of dollars, and thousands of American lives. We need more presidents who understand that war is unnecessary and a last resort.",1328659200,8,916,4.4523809523809526
3891376,5,B002AS45TM,"I found this film to be very insightful.  I appreciated how the director kept the narration to a minimum and allowed the bulk of the film's premise rest upon video and audio recordings of President Kennedy and various other officials and world leaders.  I feel that I have learned a great deal about Kennedy's presidency from this film that I had not been exposed to before.

I highly recommend this film to those who, like myself, who were not around to witness these events as they occurred.  Minimal background in history is needed to understand the film.  It may prove less interesting to those of us who witnessed these events, although the clarity of hindsight may make some events new to even those viewers old enough to recall Kennedy's presidency.",1325635200,,756,4.7846153846153845
3891377,5,B002AS45TM,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and one of the most interesting ""what ifs"" of my lifetime is what would have happened in Vietnam if JFK had not been assassinated in 1963.

3891378,5,B002AS45TM,"I just saw this movie last night at the Beloit International Film Festival (BIFF) and I am still reeling.  I was six months old when JFK was killed and frankly,embarrassingly,everything I've ever known about him has been related to me through others' opinions and glossy magazine articles discussing conspiracy theories, Camelot and Marilyn Monroe.  I feel like I just took an incredibly interesting history course, one that everyone should attend, including most certainly, our current and any future US governments.  This film should be shown to every high-schooler, and followed up again, with every college student.  What an absolute eye opener.",1298073600,14,649,5.396039603960396
3891379,5,B002AS45TM,"Of all the films made about President Kennedy, none has ever given me a more intimate and almost visceral feel for the great and relentless burden upon his shoulders. Nor have I ever admired him as greatly as I do after watching Virtual Kennedy, after appreciating how steadfastly he resisted the push by his military advisers, the Republican Party and the media to go to war. A position which I believe clearly resulted in his death.

Six times he resisted the drums of war, in just a thousand days. Having told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he plainly and simply was not going to commit ground troops to Vietnam, period, this film makes the argument (along with recent books who look at the question) that it's almost inconceivable to imagine Kennedy sending in troops... it would have flown in the face of everything this man had stood for, had expressed both publicly and privately, and it would have gone against his very deep knowledge of international affairs, world history... not to mention his understanding of battle, having been there himself.

A beautifully produced film with an ocean of press conference footage seldom if ever seen, and presented in long pieces so as to appreciate the President's body language, facial expression and most of all the anguish in his eyes as he attempted to answer questions from the media without giving details that he knew he could not reveal.. No flash-pow MTV editing here - this film was made by grown-ups.

If you're looking for the usual fawning, celebrity idolatry of Camelot, this film is not for you. But for those who seriously want to understand the man and why he was taken from is, Virtual Kennedy will be an essential part of your video library. And it will leave you with an unusually profound sadness, not simply as is usually the case over his death (we don't need another video to open those wounds again, in that for most of us of a certain age those wounds have never healed.) Instead one is reminded of and mourns the horrendous price we paid as a nation for our ego and our ignorance.",1289606400,4,2056,4.6740331491712706
3891380,5,B002AS45TM,"After deeply studying the life and philosophy, both the pros and cons, of JFK for greater than 3 years , I believe this movie is one of the best. This movie embeds the sounds, struggles, and outlooks of the JFK peace keeping ability. War does have a horrible price but so does peace, except in peace no one bleeds but only human's can grow from needed conflict. JFK and American Democracy needed the Communist's challenge. Today, what country or what idea makes America stronger and hopeful that with external pressure, a slingshot of universal pleasure can take place for global liberty. We have come to a point to where we have small tea parties, instead of un-surrendering civil revolutions. We have terror groups, who can never be seen, but we fight a number count War on Terrorism. A war where news keep the American deaths silent but make sure to print foreign suicide deaths. Like Vietnam, more foreigners will die because of American involvement. 2 million Vietnamese died along with over 58,000 American troops, including my uncle. In this movie you will notice the numerous press conference JFK had done and the what seemed like half a hundred news reports. I will alway argued that our media has looked that other way and escaping the element of ""PRESS."" Pressure is how journalism, even when you don't want to hear it or it seems like a conspiracy, keeps a democracy able to survive.",1289260800,6,1395,4.768595041322314

3891383,5,B002AS45TM,"Fascinating, informative, and cogent. My dear friends Jim Blight and janet Lang have done an extraordinary thing: they have shown that Jack Kennedy consistently kept us out of war time and again in his all-too-short tenure as president. I'm no ones' idea of a Kennedy partisan, but I'm convinced that had he lived, we would not have become needlessly embroiled in Vietnam--and the world we live in would be a truly different place as a result. I'm an historian, and like most historians I'm uncomfortable with counterfactuals. This one is different. The trend and consistency of President Kennedy's decisions when is came to the deescalation of conflicts is unmistakable. If you see just one film in the near future see this one.

Jim's a great narrator, too. What a great guy (*smile*)

We know that Vietnam escalated into a protracted, expensive war during the Johnson administration.

 Like all US Presidents he inherited not only US political and social issues but in his case the Military leaders who directed the actions of Korea and WW2 when he assumed his duties. He was young but pivotal in his shortened tenure on the stage.

3891397,2,B002AS45TM,"I enjoyed the flashbacks to JFK's presidency, but the movie did NOT deliver its promised conclusion. Rather than an analysis of whether JFK would have indeed prevented the escalation of the Vietnam war, all it did was detail LBJ's conduct of the war without coming to any conclusion.

Good history in the beginning (first 2 or 3 events), but the narrator is clearly enamored with JFK.  This makes it hard for the narrator (or whoever made the film) to look at things objectively.  I guess JFK never would have gone into Vietnam.

3891403,3,B002AS45TM,"I've often wondered how things might have been different if JFK hadn't been killed ever since National Lampoon posed the question on a cover back in the seventies. And this video has the virtue of trying to offer a serious answer to that question, or at least how the Vietnam war might have unfolded differently had Kennedy lived. Unfortunately, that's also the problem: it takes itself SO seriously that it often gets lost in the weeds of the details and loses focus. If you're old enough to remember JFK, it's fascinating to see all of this old footage, instead of just the on-and-around-November-22nd stuff that plays endlessly every November. And I think it's an honest effort to anwer the question it poses. It just doesn't do it in a very engaging way.",1372204800,,758,4.75

3891405,5,B002AS45TM,"I watched the documentary using my Roku and Amazon Prime in the middle of a sleepless night thinking the film would put me into a deep slumber.  I was absolutely mistaken.  I found it riveting.  When it was over I didn't mind at all losing the sleep.

If you ask many folks who were young in the early 60's what they remember about Kennedy's foreign policy challenges, most will mention The Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missle Crisis.  Fewer folks will mention the Cold War negotiations with Russia and the circumstances with Laos, Vietnam, or the construction of the Berlin Wall. The documentary gives a very broad brush approach to all those issues, but it is one worth watching to see the public face Kennedy presented to America on each one.  If you are only remotely familiar with the times, watch the documentary.  The footage used is generally not seen in newsreels.  It presents a more personal side of Kennedy's politics.

Two points of the film really stuck with me afterwards.  The first was Kennedy saying ""Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.""  Kennedy had the courage to stand alone and be patient, unlike Johnson who thought with his namesake.  The second was images of Kennedy alive and well in Dallas at a function and the flash on the screen of the time in minutes before his assasination.  Both points gifted me with emotional anchors to the movie.

Would we have escalated involvement in Vietnam under a Kennedy administration?  Who knows, but probably not.  The movie makes a point of detailing the personal price Johnson paid for approving the escalation.  Regardless of your politics and personal opinion of Kennedy, the movie is well worth 82 minutes of your life, even in the middle of the night.",1368316800,,1738,4.74

8360192,4,B002AS45TM,Very well crafted film that argues Kennedy would not have done what Johnson did in 1965 bomb North Vietnam and send in the marines to fight in the south. It suffers from only one talking head James Bright who does not talk about what Kennedy would have done if he was still alive in 1965 and the south was about to collapse.

8360196,5,B002AS45TM,"Looking at the Iran nuke deal in comparison with JFK's approach to Vietnam is enlightening.  JFK wanted to achieve a negotiated settlement in accordance with the dictates of the Geneva Accords.  The war hawks in the Pentagon, CIA, and Wall Street, as well as Big Oil, wanted war in Vietnam and wanted JFK dead.  JFK achieved a negotiated settlement in Laos.  He avoided nuclear war with the USS in October 1962 with regard to the Cuban Missile Crisis.  However, the nut cases like General Curtis Lemay (JCS) wanted to launch a preemptive war against the USSR and to invade Cuba.  Had JFK only authorized an invasion of Cuba, we know that would have led to a global nuclear war.  Unknown the Pentagon or CIA at that time, Cuba had more nuclear weapons than was known at the time AND was prepared to launch them.  Only the Russians stopped Castro from launching them.  Kennedy wanted a negotiated settlement in Vietnam-- which would have been in congruence with the Geneva Accords.  ALSO, Kennedy never committed combat troops to Vietnam---there were only 16,000 advisors and Kennedy order the first 1,000 of the 16,000 to be withdrawn by December 1963.  Kennedy's order was reversed by LBJ--- only two days after his assassination.  NSAM 263 by Kennedy was reversed by Johnson only two days after the Dallas assassination.  The war hawks returned to power in Washington with the removal of JFK,  Certain members of the JCS and CIA rejoiced over Kennedy's death--- including Texas oil and Wall Street bankers.  The doors to war were officially opened in 1965  when Johnson introduced the first US combat troops into Vietnam.  Now, fast-forward to July 2015.  The chicken-hawks and NEOCONS like Dick-less Cheney, Jeb Bush, and the rest of the rightwing clown car, want to scrap the Iran nuke deal.  They have stated, in compliance with the Israeli Lobby, that war is all that is needed.  That a negotiated settlement is somehow more dangerous than war.  What kind of logic is that?  It is the logic of the profit motive.  It is also geopolitical nonsense.  JFK would not go to war over nukes in Iran--- and there are NONE.  So, what is the real motive?  Obama quoted JFK on the day he announced the conclusion of negotiations with Iran--- ""Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.""  There was no negotiation with Vietnam after JFK's death,  There was no negotiation with Iraq before George Bush illegally invaded in 2003--- without UN Security Council authorization.  We have been living in a lawless world since the death of JFK,  It is clear that the Kennedy legacy offers a way out of the darkness of war and the dark visions of Neocons, apostates of Wall Street, and nut cases in the Israeli Lobby and CIA.  It is time to fight against these forces for war--- the same forces that conspired to kill JFK and to cover-up their role in the assassination.",1437004800,2,2883,4.752016129032258
