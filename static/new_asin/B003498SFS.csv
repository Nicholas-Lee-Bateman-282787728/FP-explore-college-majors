8388286,5,B003498SFS,"I enjoyed hearing Placido describe the characters in the three operas. He really gives a lot of thought to how he will portray them. He can find some reason to have sympathy for most of them as long as they have some nobility of spirit.
Then, it just happened that the three operas included in this set were ones that I don't own. They are all beautifully sung by Maestro Domingo and the lead soprano, baratone and others.
This is a DVD that I will return to often.",1462838400,,465,4.295454545454546

8388288,5,B003498SFS,"Wonderful collection of THREE Placido Domingo operas. Il Trovatore alone could cost dearly just to buy an old copy, and is the best version of the opera I have ever seen, with legendary conductor Herbert Von Karajan. Entire cast does an outstanding job, including the mad witch Azucena, played by Fiorenza Cossotto, and love interest Leonora by Raina Kabaivanska. Leonora's smiles as she gazes lovingly into Manrico's eyes - ah, beautiful. The entire opera is engaging, memorable.",1452124800,,480,5.246753246753247
8388289,5,B003498SFS,Great performances from Domingo in 3 complete Verdi operas (when he was much younger)  that will never go out of style. A  great value too as you get three full operas on this 4 disc set for the price of what it would cost you for one DVD opera today. The 4th DVD is a more recent interview with him discussing those roles and the ensembles he performed with.,1411776000,,359,4.188405797101449
8388290,5,B003498SFS,"There is no greater interpreter of Otello in this century or any other.  To have Maestro Domingo talk about the role and explain in detail his perceptions of the character is priceless!  He goes into detail about his roles in Il Trovatore and
Ernani in which he is an extraordinary performer of these characters as well.  His presence on the stage in these roles and
his golden tenor voice result in outstanding experiences for the audience. At no time does he take the performances
for granted or give less then his all when performing them.  The interview DVD is worth it's weight in gold!!
You will not/can not be disappointed in any way with the opera performances or the 'mini masterclasses' that you have
the privilege of listening to on the interview DVD.",1284163200,8,762,4.706766917293233
