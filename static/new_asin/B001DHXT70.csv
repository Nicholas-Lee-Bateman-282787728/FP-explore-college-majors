3529798,3,B001DHXT70,"we love dora the whole movie is all singing songs it is no talking, it is not what i anticipated but thanks anyway",1299715200,,114,4.0
3529799,1,B001DHXT70,"This DVD is just a hodgepodge of songs from other discs.  I presumed that it would at least have a storyline, because the cover appears to show an ""American Idol""-like stage.  Not a bit of it.  There is not even a pretext of a storyline.  Each song is about 30 seconds long, and they are just strung together back to back.

Very disappointing.  Avoid this one.",1252713600,2,360,4.378787878787879
3529800,3,B001DHXT70,My 4 year old daughter choose this video herself.  She loves Dora but was disappointed once she watched the dvd.  She only watched it once and I don't think she will view it again.  The songs are not easy to sing along to and some are really more speaking than singing.,1235779200,2,269,4.235294117647059
3529801,4,B001DHXT70,My 5 year old and 3 year old both love watching Dora and singing along.  Great cd for children who like Dora and love to sing.  It is a big hit in our house!,1231286400,,157,3.588235294117647
3529802,2,B001DHXT70,"My daughters (11 to 4) love Dora and we have about 15 Dora DVDs, but I was highly disappointed when I popped in this one for my kids. If I would have known it was going to be a recap of songs instead of the usual adventure that happens, I would've steered clear of this title. Thanks Amazon for dropping the ball on the Product Description for this DVD when I ordered it, and 2 months later there is still nothing that describes this as a rehash of past songs. I wouldn't recommend this if your kids are Dora fans because it is not what they are used to.",1231113600,7,554,4.091743119266055
3529803,5,B001DHXT70,My son has really enjoyed this video. He sings along with it... and sings to it even when its over!!!lol!,1228003200,3,105,4.3

3529812,2,B001DHXT70,"My kids like Dora and LOVE wheels on the bus song.  Though it would be great to combine.  Was wrong.  The song had only two verses and kids kept asking for more.  The rest of the songs were short too, so it was pretty much a DVD of what you might want but can't have. You get a little taste and if the kids in a good mood they will let you rewind to the beginning of the song which is less than a minute long.",1399680000,,409,3.7209302325581395
3529813,5,B001DHXT70,This is our 2nd purchase for this one. We played the first so much it decided enough is a enough and eventually stop playing. I purchased this again for my little girl and she loves it and so do I. It's very educational and funny. Well worth the money!,1383091200,,252,4.163265306122449
3529814,5,B001DHXT70,"A regular Dora episode does not hold my daughter's attention, but she can watch this all day.  Whoever edited this video was a moron, it was very poorly done.  But, my daughter doesn't seem to mind.",1375401600,,198,4.472222222222222
3529815,3,B001DHXT70,"It just isn't what i expected.  It isn't the usual format that the other dora movies follow, it is simply a collection of songs from the other adventures. It isn't bad or anything i was just a little disappointed, especially because it seemed like it was over so quickly.  i should note however that even though i wasn't impressed my 2 yr old loves it.",1361664000,,352,4.4
3529816,5,B001DHXT70,"My little granddaughter loves this DVD. She loves music. The nice thing is that my granddaughter copies some things Dora does in the movie and learns a lot. Fun, enjoyment and educational for the children at the same time.",1354147200,,222,4.717948717948718
3529817,5,B001DHXT70,"If you are buying this for a story line, there is none.  From beginning to end, this DVD is a recap of Dora's song videos.  We bought this for our daughter when she was 2 (she is 5 now).  For the first few months after we bought it, nothing will keep our daughter engaged as this DVD.  If we don't interfere, we usually do after about 30 minutes of watching, which is also about how long this DVD is, she will keep it rolling again and again with out showing any boredom.  Past forward 3 years, she still pops this DVD every now and then and sings along to brag around her 1 year old sis.",1354147200,6,588,4.0344827586206895
