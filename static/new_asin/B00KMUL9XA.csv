6434206,3,B00KMUL9XA,"This movie was okay for what it was. In my opinion there could have been alot more to it. They could've done anything with the storyline, but it was lax in some spots. The fight scenes were good though.",1421366400,,202,4.205128205128205

The general premise follows the idea that there's an alternate reality, where copies of yourself exist. In this case, one world is slightly more rodoiactive in nature, thus the people living there are tougher when they cross over into the new world. Their reasons for crossing over are to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, which was a technology banned by all nations after WWII. Nobody has nukes, nor do they have guns. The world attempted to build a more peaceful existence. They do have blades however.

That plot is a mute point though since the film is really about the four lead actresses who were trained from childhood to find and eliminate invaders that cross over into their dimension. As is the Japanese style of storytelling, not everything is as it seems. There's definitely some betrayal involved, as well as some gotcha moments. Anyway, the film takes us through several fight scenes and includes several twist and turns, until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

When I first became aware of this movie, I thought it was going to be another cutsie J Pop film, only this time, it  put the girls in a combat situation. But after the first twenty minutes or so, the plot actually began to develope into something decent. Sure, the budget was low. But the movie draws you in and you begin to disregard that fact. The fights themselves were well choreographed and it was almost like watching Power Rangers, only with a little more violence and cute girls doing all the butt kicking. We're also spared all the bloody violence that can sometimes accompany these types of films. In fact, there was hardly any blood at all. That was the intended style though, not an oversight.

Plus Rina Takeda appears and there's a reason why she's becoming the new Karate sweetheart. She has good screen presence.

The tech aspects include a Japanese language track with English subtitles. There's also an English dub, if you don't like subtitles. The dub is passable.

In the end, this was a fun film, with better than expected fights in it. It doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it shove the plot under the rug. It strikes a decent balance between the Sci Fi and martial arts elements. I'd consider it a PG-13 film, if it had a rating on it. A good choice if you like live action anime, light martial arts films, or you just want to see cute girls kicking butt. Not a heavy film, just fun.",1420156800,4,2476,4.613636363636363

6434211,4,B00KMUL9XA,I agree with what the other reviewers were saying. The only problem for me was that there needed to be some kind of blood wounds be having none was a detraction for me because if you seen a ton of action movie before this one.,1413849600,,226,4.044444444444444
6434212,4,B00KMUL9XA,"This is a fun movie, well worth the price.  What impresses is the fact that the girls did all their own fight scenes.  The movie does suffer from a low budget and is maybe a little too kid-friendly at times (i.e. cartoony villains).  But it's worth a look.  I'm hoping there's a sequel.  P.S.  When I first posted this review the DVD was on sale for $5.99 - hence ""well worth the price.""  I might recommend waiting for it to return to a sale price before purchasing.",1413331200,4,466,4.287356321839081
6434213,4,B00KMUL9XA,"A family friendly film (no blood, no nudity) that has lots of martial arts action along with sword fighting. The story takes place on an alternate earth where nuclear weapons were abolished globally in the sixties. By the present day even guns are a rarity rarely seen by the public. However, invaders from our world decide that such a world can be taken over by subterfuge. Seems that scientists working on a way to traverse dimensions figure that if they can take over Japan and reintroduce nuclear power then soon that world will be theirs. The four women of the title have stealth tech and superior strength to defend against these incursions. Rina Takeda (of Karate Girl, Kunoichi) stars as one of the four. Three and half stars and not bad for under ten dollars.",1413072000,6,768,4.696296296296296

8660165,4,B00KMUL9XA,This is an unusual martial arts movie. It's surprisingly good with the action sequences and acting being much better than expected. The plot is unusual (it exists and is coherent for a start). This is an unexpected guilty pleasure and a must for fans of Japanese martial arts B-Movies.,1453680000,,285,4.836734693877551

8660167,5,B00KMUL9XA,"Don't let the comments about lack of special effects discourage you from viewing this film!  The absence of blood is a bit odd at first, but the fantastic fight scenes soon have you forgetting about that.  The actresses also appear to perform all the moves themselves without stunt doubles, adding a nice touch of realism.  And the best part is- there could be a sequel!",1432425600,2,370,4.661538461538462
