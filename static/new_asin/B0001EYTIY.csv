8011663,4,B0001EYTIY,"Uneven, but full of wonderfully acted, beautifully observed moments in the life of an unconventional, family, this was called, by one
critic, an Australian Hannah and her Sisters.  And to an extent thats not a bad description.

But this film  is messier, less complete in its vision and less bold in its style.  That said, its still entertaining, moving,  playful and very worth seeing.

Bruno Ganz is terrific as a narcissistic, but funny and often endearing (when not frustrating) French &eacute;migr&eacute; to Australia, full of life, but with the impulse control of a 6 year old. (his native German accent slips in occasionally, but not enough to really be a problem).  Kerry Fox as a very emotional daughter and wanna be writer just starting to find herself in life keeps up with him.  Both bring a kind of joie de vivre to the screen that feels very genuine.  When they dance with wild abandon (and humor) it never feels forced or acted, but like they are really having the most wonderful time.

The only character I had any kind of problem with was Lisa Harrows Beth, the matriarch of the clan, and Ganzs lover.  She repeatedly tells us how difficult she is, and Ganz treats her as if that were the case, refusing her sexual desires, cheating on her, talking about how she doesnt know how to love, but whether its the writing or the performance, I don't see that side of her character.  So Beth ends up as a bit of a
martyr, and those that wrong seem bewilderingly mean and selfish.  If we saw more of her dark side the film might have felt better balanced. This is not a film for heroes and villains.

Also, for me, the ending felt rushed, as if things had to get to a conclusion.  Its a film  Id actually wished had gone on longer, or had been willing to leave things less resolved.  Once you start  with the messiness of life, you lose something with a last minute switch to the neatness of movies.

By the end, I found myself sad to leave these characters, as if they were old friends, and wishing I could stay on to see what happens next.  I'll take that in a film.",1302739200,,2078,4.461538461538462
8011664,5,B0001EYTIY,This is a gem from aussie film maker Gillian Armstrong  - no Hollywood glam here; an honest portrayal of Aussie sisters and their family life. One of Bruno Ganz' earlier films.  great to hear Everlovin' Man by the Loved Ones. Not sure if US audience would relate to this.,1243987200,,271,4.510204081632653
8011665,1,B0001EYTIY,"CHEZ NOUS-French for ""Our House""....and a most unpleasant house it is in Gillian Armstrongs's 1992 Down Under film THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS.This is 90 minutes of complete disconnect of both people and consciences and Armstrong directs it accordingly.
Beth (Lisa Harrow) is a writer who lives in suburban Sydney,Australia with her French husband Jean-Pierre (Bruno Ganz).He has married her in order to ultimately obtain citizenship; but it would seem that their marriage is on shaky foundation. Beth's younger sister Vicki (Kerry Fox) returns home and is pregnant. She aborts the child and falls into an affair with Jean-Pierre while Beth goes on a road tour with her Dad (Bill Hunter) with whom she has never had connection. Beth returns home to be confronted by this affair. All the while, Beth's daughter (Miranda Otto) and boyfriend are playing ""Jelly's Last Jam"" on the piano. GOT IT? GOOD!...now you don't have to watch it!
This is the fourth Gillian Armstrong film I have seen, and every one of them tells plot points but never divulges character feelings and motivations. The films flit from point to point with no connective material. You scratch your head and say, ""What?"" Armstrong is only mildly more successful in later years with OSCAR AND LUCINDA and CHARLOTTE GRAY,  thanks to fellow Aussie Cate Blanchett whose presence lightens Armstrong's terribly unconventional sensibility. As a director,Armstrong is at the bottom of the Down Under!",1197936000,,1455,5.139240506329114
8011666,5,B0001EYTIY,"This is classic Gillian Armstrong giving us a snapshot of inner-urban life in a Sydney home one long humid summer.

JP (played brilliantly by Bruno Ganz who was so memorable in Wim Wenders' ""Wings of Desire"") is a Frenchman far from home. With his marriage to Beth (a woman whose vitality seems to have been snuffed out by marriage) already under stress, it takes only the arrival of Beth's wild and vibrant sister Vicki to send everything spinning out of control.

Vicki is Beth mirror image - but she is a reflection of what Beth once was. Beth longs to be wild and alive once more but that can never be. JP sees in Vicki what attracted him to Beth - and alone and longing for something that he can't find Down Under, JP drifts apart from Beth as she does from him.

But Beth has another problem - unresolved issues with her father (played by Bill Hunter who seems to be everywhere in Australian movies). Her father has all the personality of a prune, and won't admit his oldest child is now a grown woman with a mind of her own.

Beth, played in a deeply stressed manner by beautiful NZ actress Lisa Harrow, finds is being tossed about from the roles of mother, daughter and wife all at once - and she's the one that is left to suffer.

Truly a brilliant film, with a young Miranda Otto in the role of Beth's all-observing but resilient daughter, this is a touching film that captures much of the tension of our lives that will often cannot identify.",1158624000,,1453,4.406716417910448
8011667,3,B0001EYTIY,"I didn't think this terrifically good, although the acting was superb.  Mostly a character study about two sisters and the husband of the eldest.",1140134400,,145,5.041666666666667
