7885321,2,6305194564,"I bought this VHS to gain some X-rated insight into the behind-scene games of the gambling industry including strip joints. I thought this would help in learning more about Atlantic City, LV, etc. Instead I found this to be a crude rapper's video that was focused on satisfying fans of the ""Big Ballers."" I had never heard of this group or its movement before.  I don't know Trick Daddy, Jermaine Dupri, Kilo and Cash.  The Big Ballers seemed to enjoy beefy women, self-aggrandizement & applauding themselves. Whatever, the sandman came about 1/2 way through and the next thing I knew, the clock had moved ahead two hours with the video rewound.  Good.  For those who enjoy deep rap and the Big Ballers, this is ideal.  They will find the movie 5*****. For dull squares like me, 2** is being generous but allows for the fact that there are some fans of this stuff.  Cussing is the norm so get ready for many combinations of X-rated words, seemingly often added to titilate interest, rather than to fit.
