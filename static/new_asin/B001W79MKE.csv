3824276,5,B001W79MKE,I purchased the DVD Psych for my grandson who lives in the Netherlands.  He happened to catch an episonde when he was visiting.  He is so happy with it that he has asked that his next birthday gift be episode three.,1246752000,,215,4.219512195121951
3824277,5,B001W79MKE,This show is my husbands favorite of all time.  The humor is quick and if you didn't live in the 80's you won't get a lot of their one liners.,1246320000,,142,3.7333333333333334

3824279,4,B001W79MKE,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written detective series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes on, on the heels of ""Monk."" While the first season needs a bit of ironing, ""Psych: Complete First & Second Seasons"" does a good job blending comedy and mystery, and gives us some lovably fradulent guys to follow the adventures of.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant and intelligent by his strict, humorless father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. And though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police. Even if he only sees them on TV.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. So he drags his very reluctant pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill) out of a boring job, and they end up regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Carl Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who doesn't buy their act.

And so they set out into a variety of cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention (where they mess with George Takei's head), alien abductions, speed dating, underground poker, and organizing a surprise birthday party for Lassiter.

And the second season is no less uproarious when Shawn and Gus have to protect a verbally abusive Simon Cowell clone (Tim Curry) and deal with crimes involving a dinosaur, Yuletide murder, fixed horse races, murder at a telenovela, nanny-related thefts, bounty hunters, chop shops, a murder committed by a 3000-year-old mummy, and even a run-in with a crazy megarich woman that Gus once drunkenly married during spring break.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. The mysteries are light and fun, and the people making it actually seem to be enjoying themselves -- no hardcore crimes, gore and grimness.  Instead there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (""It's spontaneous psychic krav maga!"") and enjoyable mysteries, usually involving some unusual plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage? Refrigeration trucks?).

 Each episode is a well-done little mystery, usually with some solid whodunnit material, dozens of pop culture references (from James Bond to wikipedia). Not to mention the hilarious dialogue  (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness (Shawn's pseudo-mystical ""episodes"") that keeps it from ever being dull -- mostly supplied by Shawn, but everybody gets some fun time. Gotta love that.

There is a slight flaw, though -- in the first season, a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as time goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out. Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble.

On the official side of the cast fence, we have the crusty, hard-nosed Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson (""an enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle"") to round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow but privately indulges in spray-tans and radioactive shirts.

""Psych: Complete First & Second Seasons"" is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a good show to keep an eye on.",1238112000,29,4203,5.05635838150289

3824282,5,B001W79MKE,"My 12yr. old nephew was visiting one weekend and there happened to be a ""Psych"" marathon on. Needless to say, I was hooked! I went online and ordered the first 2 seasons right away so we could have our own ""marathon."" One month later and I've ordered the next two seasons. Can't wait for season 5 to be released.",1302912000,,312,4.305084745762712
3824283,5,B001W79MKE,"We are big Psych fans, but didn't start watching until Season 2, so we are having a blast watching Season 1.  The pilot was hysterical.",1302393600,,135,4.4
3824284,5,B001W79MKE,"If you like slapstick mystery capers, you'll love this show. Especially these 2 seasons....I think they're the best of all. Fun and funny. I can watch them a lot more than once.

You get a good variety in the 2 seasons.

Thumbs up for both!!",1300579200,,241,4.333333333333333
3824285,5,B001W79MKE,"Started watching after it was in syndication, had to have all the episodes. The obscure references and repartee is a hoot!",1299888000,,122,4.857142857142857
3824286,5,B001W79MKE,"Packaging and DVD quality was great. Funny show, but in danger if becoming to repetitive if it runs for too many seasons.",1296518400,,121,4.545454545454546
3824287,5,B001W79MKE,"Love, love love this series.  It is absolutely hilarious.  I watch an episode while I'm jogging on my treadmill and the time just flies.  I recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh",1289865600,,187,4.4411764705882355
3824288,4,B001W79MKE,"Just for the show itself I would definately buy the DVD. The extras such as deleted scenese are good but not great, thus only four stars.",1289433600,,137,4.3076923076923075
3824289,5,B001W79MKE,Not only is the DVD set in excellent condition but so was the service from Amazon.com and Ironman.,1287705600,,98,4.5
3824290,5,B001W79MKE,"I started watching Psych a few years after it came on the air, so i wasn't completely sure i would like the first two seasons as much as the third.  But i do.  This show is so funny that i frequently have to rewind to catch what was said while i was laughing too hard to hear.  It is for people who are intelligent and can pick up on all kinds of humor.  There are lots of references to pop culture, which sometimes leave you feeling on the outside of an inside joke (and sometimes on the inside of it).  But overall, the show is not only engaging in its plot, it's one of the funniest things to ever hit the small screen.  Plus, a great price here at Amazon!",1273536000,,659,4.030769230769231
3824291,5,B001W79MKE,"Great show, very witty, tons of obscure references to jog your memory and keep you running to the internet.  My 12 year old daughter bought this set and we all enjoy it, even if she doesn't catch all the 80's nods.",1272931200,,214,4.219512195121951

3824296,4,B001W79MKE,"Hands down my wifes favorite show.  Its funny and entertaining, but more importantly its not a series that you have to follow each and every episode to know whats going on.  The 2 pack was a fantastic way to capture the story without paying as much.  Highly recommend",1268006400,,267,4.520833333333333
3824297,5,B001W79MKE,I had never seen the show before. I am totally hooked. Plus there is nothing offensive in it for teenagers. Big hit!,1264550400,,116,4.318181818181818

3824299,5,B001W79MKE,"Psych is in its' fourth season on USA network and the show has succeeded in keeping my interest. For example James Roday and Dule Hill,the two main actors on the show have a chemistry that keeps you watching. The characters Shawn and Gus always get into trouble but the psychic visions that Shawn claims to have always get them out of trouble with the cops. For instance, Shawn and Gus involve themselves in a case where the woman on trial and her lawyer don't have much hope. Even one of the cops wants to help them, but he can't so they go to Shawn's dad, played very well by Corbin Bernsen, who helps them using his old police contacts.
I was happy purchasing the product not only because I watch the show but because it is a clever blend of comedy and drama. O.K. more comedy than drama. Watch it sometime.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psych-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B001W79MHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psych: The Complete Third Season</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psych-The-Complete-First-Second-Seasons/dp/B001W79MKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psych: The Complete First & Second Seasons</a>",1256515200,,1186,6.107784431137724
3824300,5,B001W79MKE,"Psych is a great show. It's funny, witty, really well written and acted. It's also a refreshing new idea and concept. You also have to pay attention for the obscure references that come pretty quick. This show does not have the vulgarity or constant sexual referenses a lot of other shows have to resort to. Our entire family can watch and be entertained. Like I said, Great show.",1256428800,,380,4.602941176470588
3824301,5,B001W79MKE,I bought this for my college age daughter at her request - she had starting watching season 4 but had not seen the first three seasons. I've watched some of these with her and they are hilarious. I expect we will be buying season 3 soon.

3824302,5,B001W79MKE,This is the type of show I always look forward to watching. All the cast have great chemistry especially the 2 main stays. I haven't bought any Psych complete season yet but I am definitely buying all the seasons once it comes out in blu-ray. This show is simply one of my favorite tv shows of my life and that is no joke.

3824306,5,B001W79MKE,"My husband and I love Psych and this was a very economical way to get the first two seasons on DVD.  It's sort of the like The Mentalist but it doesn't take itself seriously at all and it's really, really funny.  Great cast, good writing, and 80s references abound.  Try to find the pineapple in each episode...good, clean entertainment.  Go USA Network!",1252886400,3,354,4.661290322580645

I love the relationship between shawn and gus. gus cracks me up with his 'phobias.' i think the season 1 finale 'scary sherry' might still be my favorite episode. when the lights go out after the 'ghost is seen in the window and the lights come on and all you see is gus' teacup sitting on the couch and then shawn and gus running out the door screaming like 10 year old girls, fumbling with the keys once they reach the car, jumping up and down trying to get the handle to open. i almost peed myself, not gonna lie.",1312588800,,686,4.165413533834586
