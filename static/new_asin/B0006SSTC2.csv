8042936,5,B0006SSTC2,"Probably we thought we had heard everything about the now Saint Johannes Paulus---know to all as John Paul II, but it keeps getting better even from the less watched and viewed films+",1407110400,,183,4.75
8042937,4,B0006SSTC2,"It is one of the best documentaries about Pope John Paul II. There are lots of them, but some are just too small, and just a timeline. This has more ""body"" to it.

It could have been perfect, if not for a very bad, and untrue comment about Pope Pius XII. Coming from journalists, sadly, it can only mean that they wanted to perpetrate that lie on purpose.

But if you can past through that knowing that it's a lie, the documentary itself is great.",1302825600,,447,4.247058823529412
8042938,4,B0006SSTC2,"I like this DVD.  I bought it believing it was 75 minutes.  It is actually 45 minutes of biographical information and another 30 minutes of NBC news short clips on various topics.

George Weigel, papal biographer (Witness to Hope) is interviewed in this documentary. Several Childhood friends and fellow priests are also interviewed.

There is so much that the late pope said and did that simply is not covered in the video.

Major themes covered:

His childhood and early years
Rise to the papacy
Poland and Communism
The assassination attempt
The Catholic/Jewish relationship
His relationship with the United States
His ailing later years

All in all, you get a quick overview of a very influential historical figure.

I personally think you get a better glimpse of the man in the video ""Witness to Hope"" by George Weigel.",1206835200,2,824,4.963503649635037
8042939,3,B0006SSTC2,"Frankly, I was looking for some of the great coverage of John Paul II's life and papacy that aired on most of the networks during the days they covered his death and funeral.  This wasn't it.  It was good info. if you're looking to add to your John Paul II collection.  But if you're looking for the really insirational stuff about him drawing the largest crowds on earth and his last days ... you'll have to look somewhere else.  I guess I could have noticed the dvd's release date too.",1134345600,6,487,4.377777777777778
8042940,5,B0006SSTC2,Really interesting DVD.  I couldn't believe NBC News put this out... but then again I'm not surprised because of the terrific storytelling.,1112486400,9,139,5.318181818181818
8042941,5,B0006SSTC2,Amazing tale of an amazing and important life...great extras in addition to the main show,1112486400,7,89,5.0
8042942,5,B0006SSTC2,"This NBC News DVD reminds us of the incredible impact that Pope John Paul II has had on the world. The main feature is an comprehensive biography, tracing the Pope's remarkable life from his boyhood in Poland and the horrors of WWII, through to his amazing Papacy. Reporter Keith Morrison does a great job giving us not only the facts of John Paul's life, but showing how events in his life shaped his worldview and his faith. The bonus features show the real strength of a DVD by an outfit like NBC News -- segments featuring NBC Vatican correspondent Keith Miller take us back through the Pope's many travels, and bring us inside the top levels of John Paul's Vatican. Other bonus content examine a Today Show visit with the Pope; John Paul's crusade to restore the Sistine Chapel; and the many fascinating figures awarded ""sainthood"" during John Paul's long Papacy. John Paul was a sometimes-controversial, always-larger-than-life figure on the world stage, and this NBC News production does justice to all aspects of his legacy.",1112313600,51,1032,4.902857142857143
