8090633,4,B000BPL2GU,"Wesley Snipes is an underrated actor, simply put.  Want proof?  Just watch these two movies.  Snipes pretty much carries both movies and makes them what they are - which are classic Snipes action movies.  With such classic lines as ""Always bet on Black,"" roundhouse kicks, and overall badassness, Snipes shows why he is the black Chuck Norris.

You can but other movie combos of Snipes movies, but these are two of this best and some of my favorites.  The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars are the other actors.  If you're looking for great action movies, classic 90s movies, or something along the lines of ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" or possibly ""48 Hours"" then you need to get his DVD now.",1148688000,,713,4.656
