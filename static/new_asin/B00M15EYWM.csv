8669607,5,B00M15EYWM,"Not all horror movies from Japan have to have the long dark haired scary girls in them. And this movie proves that. This is a different type of ghost story.

A ghost story doesn't have to have violent shocks or loud noise to be creepy.

This film is about the stories of several different people. Some of the people's lives intertwine, and some do not. But all are touched the the cell phone app that allows him/her to talk to the dead.

Without giving too much away, this film deals with how people and spirits handle grief and death differently. Not all the people who use the app are bad, and not all the spirits who come back are bad.

The main story is about Yuri. She is a beautiful girl who takes to prostitution after her mother abandons Yuri and her baby brother. The film expands to the lives of other prostitutes and their pimp. After Yuri's brother dies, another prostitute introduces Yuri to the app. The other prostitute is mildly retarded. Her story alone is touching.

Their pimp is a good man in heart, rescuing his girls when a client gets out of hand. Another side story is a reporter trying to find the app, and her encounters with others who have used it too.

The film explores how some spirits come back for revenge, while others return to protect a loved one.

The subtitles are large and white and easy to see.",1420502400,2,1335,4.424489795918367
8669608,3,B00M15EYWM,"Talk to the Dead was another Japanese tale of how technology and the afterlife can become intertwined. Only this time, it's a phone app that creates the haunting.

The main story involves Yuri, a young lady who recently lost her younger brother due to a medical condition. Yuri and Satoshi were living alone when his death occurred. And Yuri also happened to be working late that night, thus she feels a strong sense of guilt over his death.

However, a co-worker of hers, Mayu, tells her about an obscure phone app that allows people to talk to the dead. She claims that she's been speaking to her grandmother with it. Yuri is skeptical at first, but eventually gives the app a try. Once she does, she soon discovers that she can actually contact her brother.

The app is not safe however, and Mayu warns her never to invite the person over. But eventually Yuri and Mayu get pulled into the ability to speak to their loved ones and fail to follow the rules. The film takes some twists and turns until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well, I have to say, this film could have been a lot better. It had an interesting premise to it, but overall the scares weren't fully realized. The film mostly used jump scares. They were few and too far between for my tastes. It seemed like we were being dragged along in parts, wondering when the film was going to become scary. And when it finally does get ""scary"", it wasn't as good as it could have been. I was a little disappointed with the horror aspect overall.

The film does try to add some human interest however, which helps the plot somewhat. But at the same time, there's another set of characters that are totally unrelated to the first group. I couldn't figure out why the director made that choice. The story was doing just fine with Yuri and all the conflicts that she and her co-workers were having. But we kept coming back to a female reporter, who was also trying to find the app, to write a story about it. Although she may have some personal reasons for wanting to find it too. In any case, her story didn't seem to be necessary. The reporter never joins up with Yuri in any way, and her dilemma doesn't offer more horror. It just seemed like a waste of time to me.

However, we do get some slight scares with Yuri's situation. And we also learn the life lesson that sometimes people become lonely once their loved ones are gone. Sometimes it's best to let them go. Or sometimes, it might be better to say how you feel when they're still around. These aren't lessons that are buried deep in our psyche however. They're pretty much common knowledge.

Anyway, the film is offered in Japanese only with English subtitles. The only other features on the disc are a few trailers of other films. One film called The Crone peeked my interest and showed some promise.

To tie things up, I'm being generous here by giving this film a three. I think it had a lot of potential, but ultimately missed its mark. I did like how it turned some of the background characters into more important players later on in the film. And it did include some ghostly moments, especially with Yuri's storyline. But I had to take some points away for the unnecessary storyline involving the reporter and the lack of big scares overall. In conclusion, Talk to the Dead isn't the next big J-Horror hit. It's more of a wet your appetite now, until we have something better to offer you later, type of film. At least that's how I viewed it.

 I also noticed that the same producer of The Grudge, Dark Water, and The Ring was involved with this film. But all of those films were far scarier in my opinion. That might give you something to measure Talk to the Dead by.",1413244800,3,3711,4.452135493372607
