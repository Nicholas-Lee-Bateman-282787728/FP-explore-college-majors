8087664,3,B000BK7XK4,"This DVD seems somewhat homemade. Very short movie pieces, a lot of bad graphics and required navigating in-between. Of course the stuff makes sense (All these training videos sound good). I have yet to finish watching it and see if anyhting good comes out of it...",1156118400,,265,4.782608695652174
8087665,5,B000BK7XK4,"I swear, whenever I've had help from a dog trainer and my dog gets it, the training process really has seemed like magic (and certainly nothing I could ever accomplish).  This DVD is wonderful.  Carla and Cari, the trainers, break down each item into very easy to understand and accomplish steps.",1138579200,7,296,4.784313725490196
8087666,5,B000BK7XK4,"I have tried many other training videos.  This one actually works, my wifes dogs were out of control and we tried many other training vidoes, as well as dog trainers who charge insane ammounts of money per hour.  I bought her this DVD and finally they don't jump up on our company or dig in the yard.",1136332800,14,300,4.245614035087719
