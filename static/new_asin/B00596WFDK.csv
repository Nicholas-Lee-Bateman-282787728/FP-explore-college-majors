4620537,1,B00596WFDK,"We thought this would be a cute movie for the kids.  Instead about 30 minutes into it, we were all severely bored and by the end where openly mocking the ""plot"".

The special effects were low budget, they bizareely casted people that look like well known actors and actresses and the ending was 5 minutes of head scratching.

 Our kids have a pretty high tolerance for bad movies, but this one went too far with it's horrible characters, boring plot, and terrible filmmaking.",1319932800,,475,4.686746987951807

4620539,3,B00596WFDK,My granddaughter loves Halloween and dogs so I thought this movie would be a hit. Unfortunately it was not. She was bored by it and I have to say I was too. There are some great Halloween movies out there with dogs this just isn't one.,1319328000,2,235,4.130434782608695
4620540,4,B00596WFDK,This movie got a lot of bad reviews on other sites. So I wasn't going to buy it and after I did buy it I didn't have very high expectations when I started watching it. I have to admit though that I was very happy that I bought this movie. It was super cute and kept me interested the whole time. I think it's a good family movie for Halloween and will watch it more than once this month! It isn't one of the great Halloween movies but it is pretty decent and isn't very expensive. If you like dogs and or Halloween you'll more than likely like this movie.,1318636800,9,555,4.054545454545455

The story is the typical wonderdog saves the family-in-trouble parents have all seen before. I ended up hooked into Beethoven twice, I don't know why this one didn't grab me the same way.

4620682,1,B00596WFDK,"""The Dog Who Saved Halloween"" is a cute film for kids who like dogs and Halloween. I'm not sure there's a lot more appeal.

The story in brief -- a family moves into a new neighborhood and is immediately suspicious of a creepy neighbor who seems to be plotting destruction. When the couple is trapped in the neighbor's home, only their dog Zeus can save them.

If the children aren't scared by some of the creepy effects, they'll be fine with this film. As far as plot, acting, etc it's probably only good for younger kids. Adults will only want to see it once.

I purchased this at the end of July, but because it was a Halloween movie, I didn't try to watch it until October 1.  By then I couldn't return it for a new one without a penalty and the DVD was under $5, so it wasn't worth the penalty.

4620684,4,B00596WFDK,"The Dog Who Saved Halloween...this dog has some new tricks...and treats!

Join Zeus (voice of Joey Lawrence) and the Bannister family as they move to a new house to rebuild their lives.  George Bannister (Gary Valentine) and his wife Belinda (Elisa Donovan) have moved to a new neighbourhood, just in time to celebrate the Hallowe'en season.

Belinda believes a house warming Hallowe'en party will ingrain her family in the neighbourhood and sets to win their hearts.  George, believes his neighbour, Eli Cole (Lance Henrikkson) is up to no good and decides to investigate those claims.

Ted Stein (Dean Cain) and Stewey McMann (Joey Diaz) return as the two bumbling thieves who have had previous run-ins with the Bannister family.  As part of their probation, the two must clean the city of all the dog doo that they come across.  After George hurts himself trying to find out what is going on with his neighbour, he is unable to return to work and placates himself by walking Zeus.

When the four of them run into each other, George hires the two would-be thieves to break into Eli's home and find out the secrets that lie hidden within.  What they find is not what they had bargained for, but after seeing Eli carry a treasure chest full of gold inside, how can the two of them resist?

I thought this was a very delightful and entertaining film.  The kids and I have watched this several times since receiving it and each time we chuckle at one antic or another!

I loved the role of Stewey McMann, Diaz plays him in such a comedic yet humbling manner that you cannot help but chuckle every time he is in a scene.  Cain works great alongside Diaz and the two of them make an acceptable comedy duo.

I thought that Valentine's role of George appeared a bit wooden at times, almost like his heart wasn't into the role.  His acting seemed forced when he had to interact with another, however, he more than makes up for it when he enters the house, giving his all in the comedic aspect to be found.

I love animal movies in which the animals are given thoughts and ideas.  I loved how Zeus comes to save the day, he is a very well trained animal and his cues were met with a timely manner and was believable.

There are some fart jokes and the violence consists of tripping and falling style antics.  The costumes are not that scary and other than the Eli Cole's house, most scenes are relatively horror free.  Younger children may be afraid but older children could handle the scare factor involved with the house, as comedy is also displayed alongside and it gives it a campy kind of feeling to it.

My children give this movie two thumbs up, they loved Zeus and enjoyed watching what the mystery was involving Mr. Cole's house.  The kids thought he was creepy but not scary!",1322179200,,2777,4.545271629778672
