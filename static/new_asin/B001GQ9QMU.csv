The film uses a lot of flashbacks which proved to be more useless than useful. One girl wore a leatherface, something director Jeff Burr must of had left over from another film, and like Ed Wood, hates to see a good prop go to waste no matter how inanely it ties into the tale. Scott MacDonald played an unlikeable character very well. Ryan Francis, our protagonist needed more substance to his role. His flashbacks didn't make it.

The children aspect made the film interesting and slightly entertaining, but not something I would watch twice.
