2254963,3,B0007ZSHN0,This is a basic introduction to tornadoes. There is good footage of storms from the early and mid-nineties. It contains shots I have not seen elsewhere.,1226707200,,152,4.884615384615385
2254964,1,B0007ZSHN0,I was not really impressed with this DVD. I thought it was going to be more of a professional movie and it was pretty much a lot of home videos strung together and some narraration going on for part of it. Some of the tornado footage was pretty thrilling but I got motion sickness from the camera moving too much. If you are a real tornado buff you might enjoy it but if not I would give it a pass.,1216252800,2,398,3.9875
2254965,5,B0007ZSHN0,"The product was exactly as described.  It was delivered on time, and met all my expectations.  No problems were encountered.",1205107200,,124,5.15
2254966,5,B0007ZSHN0,I bought this video to be part of a weather unit plan I had to develop as a pre-service teacher. I have found that this video will fit into the unit nicely and I will be using this entire unit as an in-service teacher. The video arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. Thank you for the great condition and great service.,1204156800,,332,4.203125
2254967,5,B0007ZSHN0,"Bought this for my 13yo daughter who loves studying weather. The footage is fantastic and there is lots of good information here. For the price, you can't beat it! 90 minutes of storm chasing excitement, plus safety information!  Highly recommended!!",1198540800,,250,5.25
2254968,5,B0007ZSHN0,"Thr dvd has all of the action that look for in a weather dvd. I,being an noaa trained volunteer weather spotter,love dvd's like this one because of the fact that all footage is ALL real-life with NO hollywood. It gives you real life situations that emergency workers have to deal with. I will also mention that i am an active DAT team member with the red cross in Greenwood and in those situations we also get involved.",1188172800,3,419,4.454545454545454
2254969,5,B0007ZSHN0,I got this for my weather-loving 5 year old. It has live footage..and  is WONDERFUL for the price.  It would be great for anyone that loves weather! Buy it...you won't be disappointed for the price!,1176163200,9,198,4.628571428571429
2254970,4,B0007ZSHN0,"This DVD has about everything a person could ask for when looking for something about tornados. There is the standard ""meteorological talk"" (which to some might be a bit on the cheesy side, but is educational and worthwhile in my opinion), great chase footage, as well as a good bit of footage about ""after the storm,"" which is usually missing in all other tornado films. There is a lot of great ""bonus footage"" too. But the best part about this DVD is, whether you love it or hate it, it only costs about $3.00, so who could complain? (I can't leave out that this DVD also has a great sound clip of the ""roar"" tornadic thunderstorms often make -- that ""freight-train"" or, as I would call it ""jet-engine"" sound that everyone always talks about hearing when there has been a tornado.)",1173657600,14,783,4.560283687943262
8054836,3,B0007ZSHN0,"Same content as found elsewhere, and probably all over the Web now too.  Fans of storms will probably love it.",1404950400,,110,4.5
8054837,5,B0007ZSHN0,"i chose this 5 star rating, because i like this one to.  it's just as good as the other twister movies.  i think this one is very interesting, because it tells about where twisters develop in peoples areas in the midwest etc.  i recommend this movie to everyone, that enjoyed the other collection of twister movies.",1392249600,,315,4.589285714285714
8054838,5,B0007ZSHN0,"This is a great old video of the Pampa Twister shown by various people, spotters in the field that had it in view as it tore through town. This is not a polished view, all to the good, but a rather unvarnished view as shown by the people in that area. It's a great look at twisters in action.",1390435200,,292,3.9661016949152543
8054839,5,B0007ZSHN0,My 9 year old loves anything to do with tornadoes and this was no exception..lots of good video and information :),1371081600,,114,4.476190476190476
8054840,3,B0007ZSHN0,"This movie was Okay.. We expected more of a ""Storm Chaser"" type movie and this was narrated almost the whole way through with more talk than we feel was necessary. This is a good documentary type movie if that is what you are looking for, but don't expect much action...",1357862400,,270,4.42
8054841,1,B0007ZSHN0,"If you want a boring man talking a lot and very few footage of tornados, get this DVD today! For me the best tornado compilation is in a VHS called ""Twister:Fury on the Plains"", unfortunately it is not available for DVD.",1310601600,,220,4.390243902439025
8054842,5,B0007ZSHN0,"This is a very nice DVD as far a clarity, audio & sound.  The seller does describe his product totally correct.  What he described is what I received.  I wanted to know if this would be narrated and about how long the playing time would be.  He does describe that it is narrated, I have bought other DVD's & VHS's that was not narrated and I was disappointed, but this seller is very clear with his description.  I will continue to buy other products from this seller.  The product came properly packaged so no damage would possibly be done while being shipped.  Good job seller keep up the good customer service.",1299024000,,613,4.468468468468468
8054843,4,B0007ZSHN0,"I rated this four stars because it came in a timely manner and good condition. I bought this for a Christmas gift, so won't know whether my grandson likes until he receives it.",1288310400,,176,4.363636363636363
8054844,1,B0007ZSHN0,"This DVD is without a doubt the WORST tornado DVD I have ever seen! I have a collection of over 20 tornado themed DVD's and this one is ROCK BOTTOM. There is a washed up, old weatherman from Tulsa that narrarates the majority of the DVD and gives tired, elementary school tips on how tornadoes form and how to survive them. I'm surprised he didn't recommend the ""southeast corner of the basement"" tip! The tornado footage is so ANCIENT it's laughable. Do not waste your hard earned cash on this junk!",1244678400,3,500,4.5054945054945055
8054845,5,B0007ZSHN0,This is a special produced by a Tulsa television station some few years back. It shows some good videos and also gives some good advice on surviving tornadoes. It comes in a cardboard sleeve.,1226793600,4,191,4.647058823529412
